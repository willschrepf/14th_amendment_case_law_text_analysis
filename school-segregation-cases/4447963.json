We are here talking about can we hide\n22 the evidence, can we hide documentation, can we not give\n23 these folks the ability to fairly adjudicate their claims\n24 in court.\n25                 Your Honor, when we were here in May 11\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0010\n\f                                                                   5\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 when I met you, at the end of their hearing, I said, Your\n2 Honor, I'm having problems with documentation and how\n3 fast can I get a hearing?     I don't know if you remember\n4 that.     You said, Luis, three days; unless they object,\n5 they have waived their notice.\n6                   I ask Chris, do you object, do you waive\n7 the notice?\n8                   And he said, no.\n9                   I said, okay, Your Honor, I'll go down\n10 there.    I'm going to talk to him about this document.\n11 It's all on the record.\n12                  I went outside, talked to Chris.      And he\n13 said, Luis, I'm not in charge of discovery.      I don't do\n14 any of that.    This is the national discovery counsel,\n15 Nelson Mullins.    And the guy that you need to talk to is\n16 Giles, you know Giles Schanen.      He is not here today.\n17 You notice that.    He's not here.    Giles Schanen.\n18                  I said, I never met Giles.    I hold you\n19 accountable because you are the face of Michelin.\n20                  And he said to me, okay, but, you know,\n21 that's the guy that is dealing with this.      You dealt with\n22 Kate Helm before, same firm, Nelson Mullins, on a case\n23 that we have previous against Michelin, same tire, same\n24 exact stuff.    And so you know how it goes.\n25                  I said, no, I don't know how it goes, but\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0011\n\f                                                                    6\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 okay.\n2                   And he said, you sign a protective order,\n3 you get the documents.\n4                   I don't like protective orders.     I really\n5 don't, Your Honor, because they hide all these defects,\n6 problems with these products away from the public\n7 forever.\n8                   Okay.   Onto documents.    That's how they\n9 get us.     They have us because without the documents I\n10 can't prove my case.\n11                  Obdulia is quadriplegic.     These are the\n12 facts.    It's not my case.    It's her.    So when I'm\n13 speaking, it's her speaking.      I'm asking you, she is\n14 sleeping, coming with her husband from Chicago to\n15 St. Louis laying on his shoulder --\n16                  THE COURT:    I'm familiar with the facts\n17 from last time and from reading the pleadings.       Tell me\n18 what you want.    How about that?\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.    I'll do that, Your\n20 Honor.\n21                  I want fairness.      And the fairness that I\n22 want -- we were here on May 11th and we were talking\n23 about that --\n24                  THE COURT:    Yeah.    What documents do you\n25 want?\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0012\n\f                                                                 7\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. GUERRA:    I'll tell you, Your Honor.\n2 I'll tell you, but I need to explain a little bit.        I can\n3 tell you exactly which documents I want.\n4                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    There they are, Your Honor.\n6 Here's the list.    Would you give a list to opposing\n7 counsel, please.\n8                  But the point I was making, all the\n9 objections of the Defendants are absolutely worthless at\n10 this point.    First, the documents are trade secret.\n11 There's a protective order.     There was no problem before.\n12 There's no problem now.      They are protected.   They never\n13 proved that they were confidential or trade secret\n14 documents.    That's okay.    They have that.\n15                 The documents are not relevant.     Okay.\n16 All right.    But this is discovery.   We're not talking\n17 about admissibility for trial.     If they are not relevant,\n18 you will be able to file the motions in limine.\n19                 But they also say, Your Honor, that -- one\n20 of the arguments that the documents are not relevant is\n21 because it relates to different tires and the tires that\n22 have nothing to do with this tire.     That's not true.     The\n23 LTX M/S line is a line of tires -- and, in fact, Michelin\n24 doesn't even categorize them by line.     It categorizes\n25 them by the type of use.      So light truck tires are\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0013\n\f                                                               8\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 manufactured, inspected and designed the same way.      And I\n2 can prove it to you with physical evidence not talk.\n3                  And also, Your Honor, remember if in fact\n4 we follow Michelin logic about just giving the\n5 documents -- you can only try the case with the documents\n6 that I choose you should have.    That's not the way the\n7 system works based upon good Texas case law.\n8                  The Cheer Mark (phonetic) case, Your\n9 Honor, that I'm sure you're familiar with from the court\n10 of appeals has pages and pages and pages of explanation\n11 why you are entitled to similar tires, not identical, not\n12 just the product, not just the identical product, similar\n13 so you can look for alternative designs, notice to the\n14 manufacturer, consequences of not putting the alternative\n15 design, all of it covered by our lawsuit.\n16                 And it says -- the phrase is relevant to\n17 the subject matter and reasonably calculated to lead to\n18 admissible evidence and legally construed to allow\n19 litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of the facts\n20 and issues prior to the trial.   And that's the point\n21 here.\n22                 Mr. Blackerby came here on May 11th and\n23 said, Your Honor, we need to have that tire -- we need to\n24 have those tires so we can have what Plaintiffs have.\n25 Just fairness, just level playing field, that's what I\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0014\n\f                                                                 9\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 want.\n2                  Because if we follow Michelin's logic, I\n3 can only have some portions of it.       I believe you will\n4 only be able to look at that tire, not even the rim.\n5 Since we were here, this is what we've done for Michelin,\n6 we sent them that tire plus the three additional tires\n7 plus the spare tire plus all the rims.       Then they call us\n8 and said, we need to inspect the vehicle.\n9                  Now, there is no evidence that any of the\n10 other tires caused anything.     And, in fact, all the other\n11 types are not even Michelin.     They inspected them all.\n12                 In addition, they said, we want to inspect\n13 the vehicle.    Okay.   There is no evidence that the\n14 vehicle caused anything, but they inspected the vehicle.\n15 And then they said, we want to inspect the seatbelts.\n16 They inspected the seatbelt.\n17                 THE COURT:    Okay.   But what do you want?\n18                 MR. GUERRA:   I want all those documents.\n19 But most important, Your Honor, they told me --\n20                 THE COURT:    All right.   Let's start going\n21 through them.    We have got to go through your request and\n22 what they're not providing.\n23                 MR. GUERRA:   Okay.    Aspect specifications,\n24 Your Honor.    Aspect specifications and you have the\n25 listings there, documents that are used by the verifiers,\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0015\n\f                                                                10\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 inspectors at the factory to determine whether or not the\n2 tire that has been manufactured is up to speed, up to\n3 spec.   And the aspect verifiers the -- the inspectors\n4 have a full set at the inspection station -- these are\n5 guys that do this day in and day out -- and they still\n6 must have all of the aspect specifications present.\n7 There's 200 of them.    On this case -- 200 aspect\n8 specifications.    On this case -- don't be sorry.      I got\n9 excited.     Interrupt me, please.\n10                 On this case, they gave me nine useless\n11 aspects.    So I'm missing 191.\n12                 Let me show you, Your Honor, how useless\n13 they are.\n14                 THE COURT:    No.   I just need you to tell\n15 me what you want.\n16                 MR. GUERRA:   Just with this stuff, but it\n17 shows they are not providing evidence.      They know that\n18 nobody can read this because what is -- what is an R3H?\n19 What is an A?   What is an E?     What is a D?   What is an H?\n20 They have the code.    It's on a general principles, which\n21 is another document.\n22                 Now, recently, about a couple of days ago\n23 or maybe Thursday, we got a letter from Mr. Blackerby\n24 that said, oh, you can have the general principles.      I've\n25 been waiting five months for them.      All right.   You can\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0016\n\f                                                               11\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 have the technical notes.     Okay.    I've been waiting\n2 nine -- five months, in fact, a year for them.\n3                    Then they said, you can have the technical\n4 notes.     Okay.   Then they said, you can have the tire\n5 nonconforming procedures.     Okay.    I also want all of the\n6 technical repertoire which tells me all technical notes\n7 that exist and then also the aspect specifications\n8 repertoire, which is French for the least of aspect\n9 specifications.\n10                   Now, I speak French, just happen to, Your\n11 Honor.    It's my second language.    My first one is\n12 Portuguese, second one is French, third one is Spanish,\n13 and this is my fourth language.      Sometimes I'm not very\n14 accurate in what I say in English and for that I\n15 apologize, Your Honor.     But I do know French.   And all I\n16 want is the same courtesy that I gave these folks that\n17 Michelin gives to us.\n18                   I also need the tolerance and the limits.\n19 The tolerances and the limits, the actual limits and\n20 tolerances, are the specifications of the tire before the\n21 tire gets baked or cured.    I don't have that, Your Honor.\n22                   I also need to get the belt skim stock,\n23 which is the material that Michelin makes or the\n24 component of material that Michelin makes that covers the\n25 components to glue them together.      It's in lay terms kind\n\n\n                      VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0017\n\f                                                               12\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 of the glue of the materials so they stay together.\n2                   I also need, Your Honor, the warranty\n3 data, the warranty data.     Every time there's a defect on\n4 a tire -- and defect includes separation, a separation of\n5 the tread belt, edge belt, because the tire is inside of\n6 two steel belts.     And when the tread comes apart with the\n7 belt, separates from the rest of the carcass, that's what\n8 I'm talking about.     It's a well-known defect and they\n9 warrant for that.\n10                  I want the warranty data on that.   It's\n11 called the adjustment data.    And it gives you all kinds\n12 of details about that gives you -- not only it gives you\n13 the claims forms initially, but also the Michelin claims\n14 forms, the dealer claims forms, gives you also those code\n15 keys for those -- for the codes.     For instance, in the\n16 case of Discount Tire, 23 is tread belt separation, 54 is\n17 edge separation.    So I need the code keys that come with\n18 the code; otherwise, I will have the same problem that I\n19 have here with the aspect specs.\n20                  You know, the issue with the aspect specs,\n21 Your Honor, and you can see that they apply even though\n22 this gentleman here filed something to say that the tires\n23 are different.    That's nonsense.   Michelin classifies\n24 their tires based upon the type of use.     So passenger and\n25 light truck, the manufacturing process, the design\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0018\n\f                                                              13\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 process, the inspection process is exactly the same.       And\n2 the proof is in the pudding.\n3                 This is one of the aspect specifications,\n4 one of the nine useless that they gave me, 51.     And each\n5 one of them will say aspect specifications, passenger and\n6 light truck, not lines, not different lines of tires, not\n7 different molds of tires, not different speeds or ratings\n8 or whatever, light truck.     All the same across the board\n9 for all light truck tires.     Michelin LTX M/S 275s, 255s,\n10 265s, 245s, 255s, all of it.    So I need all that\n11 adjustment data, Your Honor.\n12                I also need the work instructions.    The\n13 adjustment data also has graphs and photographs that\n14 depict the exact -- the type of data that they see when\n15 they get the defective tires returned and they're going\n16 to issue credits or issue -- allow the client to buy a\n17 new tire, they take photographs and they analyze all that\n18 data and send it to two centers here in the United\n19 States.   And they put charts and graphs so it shows the\n20 trend of what they are seeing.   I don't have any of that.\n21                Also I need the work instructions of the\n22 training for the tire inspectors.    The tire inspectors\n23 don't get on first day on the job and know how to inspect\n24 a tire or to build a tire.    I don't have any of that,\n25 Your Honor.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0019\n\f                                                                14\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   I mean, it's -- they gave us absolutely\n2 nothing.     They waited six months now and they're offering\n3 something else with a caveat, which is, I will give you\n4 this but you can't do that.      No.   I'm not going to take\n5 any less than what I came at.      I mean, if it was me or if\n6 it was anybody that we know, you wanted to know why that\n7 tire came apart, Your Honor.      So I need all of those\n8 documents.     I have manufacturing defects, design defects,\n9 claims for manufacturing defects, design defects.       And\n10 so, Your Honor, I need exactly those documents for the\n11 defective design, defect in manufacturing, defect in\n12 inspection, defect warranty adjustment data.      Those are\n13 documents that absolutely are necessary for Plaintiffs to\n14 fairly adjudicate their claims, Your Honor.\n15                  THE COURT:   All right.   Response?\n16                  MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, let me first\n17 start off by saying that I'm probably the guy who hates\n18 discovery disputes worse in this courtroom other than\n19 Your Honor.    I've been representing Michelin for more\n20 than 15 years.    I almost never have hearings on discovery\n21 disputes.    This is the first one I've had in more than\n22 two years.    I've had -- I literally have had a handful\n23 except one case up in Wichita Falls where I had them over\n24 and over and over again about 12 or 15 years ago.\n25                  The reason that I don't have discovery\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0020\n\f                                                             15\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 dispute hearings is we work these things out with good\n2 and reasonable lawyers.     We work them out.\n3                   I'll submit to you, Your Honor, if you've\n4 read the briefing provided by the Plaintiffs lawyers in\n5 this case, you will know they're not interested in\n6 discovery in this case.     They're interested in a\n7 discovery dispute.     What they want to do is try to\n8 prejudice this Court against Michelin by citing orders in\n9 out-of-state cases where Michelin allegedly did things\n10 that they shouldn't have done.\n11                  If I was -- these folks are from Arizona.\n12 And if I was appearing in a case in Arizona, I would\n13 admit upfront I don't know anything about the Arizona\n14 rules, but I would sure enough find somebody who did know\n15 them.    And I would rely upon them to make sure that the\n16 rules were followed.\n17                  As the Court is aware, when these lawyers\n18 from Arizona got admitted pro hac vice in this case, they\n19 had to certify that they had read the Texas rules and\n20 were familiar with them and would follow them.    And I'll\n21 submit to you they have not done that in this case, Your\n22 Honor.\n23                  They also have a Texas lawyer on their\n24 pleadings, a lawyer I know very well from Corpus named\n25 Jim Reagan.    And Mr. Reagan has had cases against\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0021\n\f                                                              16\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Michelin over the years, not just in Texas but in other\n2 states.   I've got a current -- got a case with him now.\n3 He's very familiar with the Texas rules.      The other case\n4 I've got pending with him, which is up in Palmer County,\n5 right up between Amarillo and almost on the border of New\n6 Mexico, we didn't have any kind of a hearing on discovery\n7 disputes.     We got together and we talked about what he\n8 wanted and we worked out an agreement.\n9                  We basically begged these guys -- as you\n10 will see from the letters that we attached to our\n11 response, we have begged these guys to confer with regard\n12 to this motion, Your Honor, and they have -- they have\n13 thwarted us every step of the way.\n14                 The Texas rules require a conference.     The\n15 local Dallas rules are strong as horseradish on this.      As\n16 the Court knows, they have to schedule a conference to\n17 resolve the disputed matters.    They have to schedule a\n18 conference to resolve the disputed matters.     They have to\n19 have a substantive discussion of every item presented to\n20 the Court.   Before they come in here and burden the Court\n21 and take the Court's time, there is supposed to be a\n22 substantive discussion of every item.\n23                 Instead, what these fellows do is they\n24 write letter after letter after letter and make telephone\n25 calls, Where are our documents, where are our documents,\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0022\n\f                                                             17\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 where are our documents?     They are unyielding in what it\n2 is that they want and we can talk about the details if\n3 the Court is so inclined.\n4                  Even after they filed their motion to\n5 compel, we have still continued to say, hey, there's a\n6 requirement that you confer with us on this.     We want to\n7 do it.    We had a conference scheduled for a week ago\n8 today, September 1.     We had said, hey, we need to get\n9 together on a conference call and go through these\n10 discovery requests.    We had a court reporter lined up in\n11 order to do it.   It was going to be last Tuesday\n12 afternoon, which I remember well because it was opening\n13 day of dove season.    I was taking two of my boys out dove\n14 hunting.   So I was trying to figure out, how am I going\n15 to get this call in before I take them dove hunting.\n16                 And Mr. Shapiro, who is here, you haven't\n17 heard from him, but he works with Mr. Guerra.\n18 Mr. Blackerby talked and he said, hey, in order to be\n19 able to sell Mr. Guerra on this on having a call, I'm\n20 going to need some kind of a proposal from you.\n21                 So we worked hard, Your Honor, to put\n22 together a proposal.   We went through Plaintiffs' motion\n23 to compel point by point and we put together a proposal\n24 which we think is very reasonable to try to compromise\n25 the disputes that are set out in the Plaintiffs' motion\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0023\n\f                                                              18\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 to compel.     That letter is part of Exhibit C to our\n2 response to the motion.\n3                   Mr. Blackerby sent it to Mr. Shapiro I\n4 think via e-mail.     He almost immediately got a call back\n5 where Mr. Shapiro said, this proposal is BS.     He didn't\n6 use the abbreviation.     He called it BS and he said, if I\n7 show this to Mr. Guerra he will flip out.\n8                   Mr. Blackerby said, you need to respond to\n9 it.    We need to try to confer on this.   You need to\n10 respond.    And as I understand it -- I wasn't a party to\n11 the conversation, but Mr. Shapiro said, I will have you a\n12 counterproposal in 30 minutes.    We never got any such\n13 thing.\n14                  Given all this, Your Honor, the failure of\n15 these lawyers to follow not just the Texas Rules of Civil\n16 Procedure, but the local rules of the Dallas courts, I\n17 would urge the Court not to consider this motion today,\n18 but instead to order the parties to confer.    We were\n19 prepared to do it in the presence of a court reporter and\n20 that's the only way, frankly, that we would want to do\n21 it.   But I would urge the Court to order the parties to\n22 confer, at least to narrow the issues and see that\n23 they're submitted to the Court in writing or come back\n24 for a followup hearing.\n25                  I don't think that -- when parties don't\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0024\n\f                                                                  19\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 follow the applicable rules, they should not be able to\n2 take advantage of a ruling of the Court.\n3                   THE COURT:    Well, y'all go in the jury\n4 room and start conferring and let me know when you get\n5 through conferring and we'll look at this at that time.\n6                   MR. BULLION:    Could we -- could we -- I\n7 don't know, your court reporter may be tied up with other\n8 things, but we need a --\n9                   THE COURT:    She will be tied up.\n10                  MR. BULLION:    We need to make a record of\n11 it, Your Honor.\n12                  THE COURT:    Of the conferring?\n13                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n14                  THE COURT:    Why?\n15                  MR. BULLION:    Because we need a record of\n16 what's said.   If we're able to reach any kind of\n17 agreements, we need a record of what is said.\n18                  MR.

Whoa.   Whoa.   Whoa.\n22 Y'all are both here.   Have these guys working on it\n23 through y'all.    Y'all are the ones that are always with\n24 the ultimate say in it.   Y'all are here now.

Thank you.\n2                 THE COURT:    If you can't trust each other,\n3 okay, we'll come back and you'll make your notes and\n4 we'll put on the record the different notes and we'll\n5 just kind of see how it goes.\n6                 MR.

I\n10 think y'all will figure out that and you'll be able to\n11 communicate that to the Court and I'll go from there.\n12 All right?\n13                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n14                MR. BULLION:    So I guess, Your Honor, to\n15 the extent that we're not able to reach an agreement on\n16 everything, I would like to obviously address the\n17 substantive issues.\n18                THE COURT:    Sure.   Yeah.\n19                MR. BULLION:    Thank you.\n20                THE COURT:    I don't imagine y'all are\n21 going to agree on everything, but we'll deal with it.\n22                Nice accommodations in there.      It's good\n23 enough for the jurors.   I think there's a coffee machine\n24 in there.\n25                Mr. Fisher, make sure that gets working\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0026\n\f                                                                21\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 and --\n2                   MR.

We're back on the\n6 record in Cause No. DC-14-07255 Medina vs. Michelin.          All\n7 right.     What is the results of y'all's conferring?\n8                   MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, we went through\n9 Mr. Blackerby's letter dated September 1 of 2015 which is\n10 attached as Exhibit C to our response to the Plaintiff's\n11 motion and we can just take these items in the order in\n12 which they are set out and I think we'll need to have\n13 some additional argument.\n14                  THE COURT:    All right.\n15                  MR. BULLION:    We have proposed and I\n16 probably ought to give you a little bit of background on\n17 the tire, Your Honor.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    All right.    This was a\n19 Michelin LTX M/S in the size P25570R16 and I'm sure\n20 you've read the affidavit and briefing but this tire was\n21 about 11 years old at the time of the accident.       We have\n22 already produced the specs for this particular tire plus\n23 three.    There were three common green tires.      The common\n24 green tires are basically are just the same guts but\n25 different outside.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0027\n\f                                                                 22\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    Uh-huh.   Branded different.\n2                  MR. BULLION:    I'm sorry.\n3                  THE COURT:    Basically branded different.\n4                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.    There might be\n5 a -- this is a Michelin tire but in the Uniroyal or BF\n6 Goodrich world there might be a Uniroyal version or a BF\n7 Goodrich version and they're virtually -- from a\n8 performance standpoint they're the same, but the outside\n9 they're different.\n10                 MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor, just\n11 really quick.   If we are going talk about the agreement,\n12 we are going talk about the agreement.       If it's just the\n13 argument, I'll just sit down.\n14                 THE COURT:    Well, you can sit down.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    It's going to be the argument\n16 or it's only going to talk about the scope.\n17                 THE COURT:    Well, you know, I'll hear what\n18 I want to hear and then when I get tired I'll move on to\n19 something else.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n21                 MR. BULLION:    I was just going to try to\n22 give you a little flavor for what this dispute was about\n23 and then tell you where we are and maybe argue it when\n24 you're ready.\n25                 THE COURT:    All right.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0028\n\f                                                             23\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. BULLION:   So what we have already\n2 given them is the tire in question plus the three common\n3 greens, made in Dothan, Alabama which is where this tire\n4 was made six months before and after the production of\n5 this tire, which was the 31st week of 2001.    We agreed in\n6 our letter to expand that to the whole time this tire was\n7 produced.   It was about a six-year period sometime in '98\n8 to --\n9                 THE COURT:   Why not the LTX M/S line?\n10                MR. BULLION:   Well that -- the affidavit,\n11 I think, makes it clear, Your Honor.   The line is -- this\n12 is a marketing-type -- a marketing-type designation.\n13 It's been a round for 20 plus years.   It comes in a wide\n14 variety of sizes.   The designs are different.\n15                THE COURT:   Well sure it comes in\n16 different sizes.\n17                MR. BULLION:   The proof in front of the\n18 court -- the only proof in front of the court today, Your\n19 Honor, is the affidavit of Mr. Andy Price and it talks\n20 about the fact that the tires are different sizes or are\n21 different designs and that's certainly the case.\n22                We have -- we have -- we have offered to\n23 give --\n24                THE COURT:   Why that would not be somewhat\n25 relevant to the alternative design.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0029\n\f                                                             24\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. BULLION:   I'm assuming that the safer\n2 alternative design -- the alleged safe or alternative\n3 design is Nylon Calphalon.     That typically is the safe or\n4 alternative design in this case.     We have not gotten to\n5 the expert disclosure form, but I'm assuming that's what\n6 their safe or alternative design is.\n7                 THE COURT:   Well, I know, but when you say\n8 that the --\n9                 MR. BULLION:   Yeah, in the other point,\n10 Your Honor, is we have established via Mr. Price's\n11 affidavit that information on all of this is trade secret\n12 and there's not any counterproof on it.    And as the Court\n13 knows under the Supreme Court's decision in In re\n14 Continental General Tire, once we establish the\n15 information as trade secret then the burden shifts to the\n16 Plaintiffs to come in with evidence and show that it's\n17 necessary for a fair adjudication of the Plaintiff's\n18 claims.   They've certainly claimed with lawyer talk that\n19 information on other tire lines is necessary to a fair\n20 adjudication of Plaintiff's claim, but they haven't\n21 brought forward any proof at all with respect to that.\n22                We're willing to give up the -- we're\n23 willing to give up information on the tire in question\n24 because there is a protective order in place and we're\n25 willing to concede that information on the tire in\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0030\n\f                                                               25\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 question is necessary to a fair adjudication.     But when\n2 you get far afield and what they want, Your Honor, is '98\n3 all LTX M/S tires from '98 to 2012 from the affidavit\n4 we've looked at a six-year period from '98 to 2003 if you\n5 got all of those tire lines we're talking about 50 some\n6 odd different tires, 5,000 specs almost 20 million tires.\n7                   If you expand it to their scope this is\n8 one of Michelin's best selling tires in history.      They\n9 have been making it for 20 plus years.      LTX M/S, Your\n10 Honor, is to Michelin like Chevrolet is to General\n11 Motors.    It's a market.   And if you expand it to 150 to\n12 discover -- if I talk in between 50 and hundred million\n13 tires, maybe more than 100 million tires and they haven't\n14 demonstrated a need for them.     They haven't demonstrated\n15 that it's necessary to a fair adjudication of Plaintiff's\n16 claims.    That's really is the point that I'll come back\n17 to with regard to anything.\n18                  If you're trying to expand the scope,\n19 you've got to show a need for these documents.     They can\n20 do that.    They can come up with an affidavit from their\n21 tire expert and he can say, I need this that and the\n22 other.    In order to be able to prove my case I need this,\n23 that and the other and they have not done it.    They've\n24 got no proof whatsoever.     They could've submitted an\n25 affidavit or they could have had testimony.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0031\n\f                                                                26\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   As I said the only evidence before the\n2 Court is the affidavit.\n3                   THE COURT:    The trade secret affidavit.\n4                   MR. BULLION:    Sir?\n5                   THE COURT:    Right?   The only evidence is\n6 you say it's y'all's trade secret affidavit.\n7                   MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.   And it's got more\n8 than just trade secret.     It's got a lot of information --\n9                   THE COURT:    I understand but your\n10 argument.\n11                  MR. BULLION:    Right.\n12                  THE COURT:    Or part of this was.\n13                  MR. BULLION:    Right.   That's exactly\n14 right.\n15                  THE COURT:    And established trade secret.\n16 They've got to come forward.\n17                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor.   That's\n18 exactly right.\n19                  THE COURT:    And you're saying they didn't\n20 come forward with any evidence.\n21                  MR. BULLION:    Right.   Exactly right.\n22                  THE COURT:    What about that?\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your.   The case that\n24 you -- if I may refer you to Your Honor, Exmark case.         It\n25 talks about all of this.      In fact, when we were in there\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0032\n\f                                                                27\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 we were willing to reduce -- and this is 20 million\n2 tires.    That's 20 million tires sold.       The specifications\n3 are much less than that.      And we were willing to reduce\n4 it to 10 years from '98 to 2008.\n5                  THE COURT:    Wait a minute.    You're off\n6 point.\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.   Yes.\n8                  THE COURT:    He said that they've got an\n9 uncontroverted trade secret.\n10                 MR. GUERRA:    They don't.\n11                 THE COURT:    Affidavit and that y'all\n12 needed to come forward with some evidence.\n13                 MR.

GUERRA:    Okay once he tells us that he\n6 is -- he says that he is a senior consultant.        Is he a\n7 tire builder, no.     Is he a tire designer, no.\n8                   THE COURT:    Wait.   Wait.   Does this all go\n9 to the point that you didn't have to come forward with\n10 any evidence because they didn't establish trade secret?\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    First, they didn't establish\n12 trade secret and secondly, Your Honor, second, I have the\n13 proof and the documents.      Every single one of these\n14 documents relate to light truck and tires.        Now they\n15 refuse to produce the documents and then they say you\n16 come up with evidence, but it's difficult to do, Your\n17 Honor.    But I know for a fact that this applies across\n18 the board aspect specification and warranty data.       How do\n19 I know that warranty data the adjustment data may tell us\n20 all the information about the tires.        Because on the Velo\n21 case.\n22                  THE COURT:    All right.

Y'all\n3 come up here.    Vielica if you will.\n4                  (A break is taken.)\n5                  THE COURT:    All right.   We're back on the\n6 record in Cause No. DC-15-07255.\n7                  All right.    I'm sorry I interrupted you\n8 counsel.\n9                  MR. GUERRA:    No problem, Your Honor.   It\n10 was good we took a breather.\n11                 Your Honor, we have that Velo case before\n12 this one and discovery on that case was end of with a\n13 lady by the name of Kate Helms from the same firm of that\n14 gentlemen Giles and I just found out when I was in there\n15 that she's involved also in the discovery of this case,\n16 this specific case.    So the Velo case was the LTX M/S\n17 from the same plant and was also from 2001, three weeks\n18 before so the Velo tire is a little older than this tire,\n19 three weeks old.\n20                 On that case we got production and that\n21 was a 265.   We got production on some 235s, 245s, 265.\n22 We got 16 rims, 17 rims.     This argument here is made for\n23 the courtroom today.\n24                 Now the point that we're talking about\n25 visible alternative design, this is what the Court of\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0035\n\f                                                                  30\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Appeals said.     What Defendants are confusing is they\n2 wanted to give us only the identical tires, the identical\n3 design.\n4                   THE COURT:    I understand.   I understand.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    -- as opposed to alternative\n6 design and this is what the Court of Appeals said back in\n7 2009; and this is the products liability case, trade\n8 secrets.     It's about vehicle aspects or whatever and it's\n9 about also a lawn mower.\n10                  Indeed.   Indeed.   Because products\n11 liability claimants must prove a safer alternative\n12 design, it would be absurd to limit the discovery to the\n13 specific model at issue because that would necessarily\n14 preclude alternative discovery and alternative request.\n15 It doesn't even make sense, you know, Your Honor.       I need\n16 to put alternative --\n17                  MR. BULLION:    I'm sorry.    I thought you\n18 were done with that.\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    I need to prove alternative\n20 design.    I need to prove awareness of the danger.     I need\n21 to prove visibility, all of that information is there.\n22 This millions and millions.      This is lawyer talk, Your\n23 Honor.    And going back to the affidavit that you demand\n24 and I check them because it's not a tire builder, not a\n25 tire manufacturer.    It doesn't say on the affidavit\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0036\n\f                                                             31\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 anywhere not a tire designer; didn't design this tire;\n2 was not a project manager; didn't work on the plant and I\n3 remember that name, Your Honor.    I remember that name\n4 because years ago I did a deposition in South Carolina at\n5 the Nelson Mullins office and who attended that\n6 deposition in addition to the four attorneys who were\n7 representing Michelin Vandy Price. He works on the\n8 litigation Defendant of Michelin.     I think he a\n9 paralawyer, you know, I know if he is a paralegal or a\n10 lawyer.   I don't know.   He is some type of individual on\n11 that tier which was 2014.   I got on the record he is\n12 currently employed in the legal department for Michelin.\n13                Now they have other people there and I\n14 checked to see if he was a professional engineer\n15 registered in South Carolina where Michelin is located at\n16 the MARC Center.   That's why he works at MARC Center\n17 because the litigation is at the MARC Center.   The\n18 lobbyist, the major lobbyist we choose them that\n19 testifies in all these case runs the litigation\n20 department.   Vandy works underneath him.\n21                So I checked South Carolina.   He is not a\n22 professional engineer in South Carolina so maybe he has\n23 some technical experience so I checked Alabama, Dothan.\n24 No, he is not registered as a professional engineer in\n25 Dothan.   He never claims to have worked at the plant in\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0037\n\f                                                                 32\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Dothan, never been at the plant, never been a\n2 professional so I also checked if he was a professional\n3 engineer in Texas because that's where it -- he is not,\n4 Your Honor.     He is a guy that they wrote the affidavit\n5 and decided in the end but he's not qualified.       They have\n6 not established any qualifications for him to say that he\n7 knows the tire that the tires are differently\n8 manufactured that the tires are differently inspected and\n9 be there that it's a trade secret, Your Honor.       If it\n10 were, there was a protective order.     What is the harm.\n11 If the documents are not relevant shove them away.      Force\n12 them to return like I did on a prior case.       There is no\n13 harm.    But this woman is entitled to know why the tire\n14 came apart.\n15                  THE COURT:    All right.   Let me ask you:\n16 Different sizes and all that you have alluded it in the\n17 LTX M/S line, how many different sizes are we talking\n18 about?\n19                  MR. BULLION:    If you look at Mr. Price's\n20 affidavit, Your Honor.    Can I briefly respond?\n21                  THE COURT:    Well, why don't you answer my\n22 question first.\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    245, 255.\n24                  MR. BULLION:    There are -- if you look at\n25 that pair of 18 in Mr. Price's affidavit it says the LTX\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0038\n\f                                                                33\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 M/S line in it's common greens manufactured between '98\n2 and 2003 that's the time frame that we've offered to\n3 decide will encompass approximately 54 tire models built\n4 more than 5,000 tire specifications, approximately\n5 19.2 million different tires; that's for a six-year -- a\n6 six-year period.\n7                 THE COURT:    Well --\n8                 MR. BULLION:   Can I -- I definitely need\n9 to respond to what he said about the Velo at some point\n10 whenever you're ready.\n11                THE COURT:    Yes.   Well, tell me.\n12                MR. BULLION:   Velo involved a certain size\n13 of LTX tire also made at Dothan.     I wasn't in this case.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    I was.\n15                MR. BULLION:   But I do have the Rule 11\n16 Agreement.   There was a motion to compel filed.     There\n17 were no common greens to the Velo tire.      I'm saying it\n18 wrong, I'm sure.   In this case there are common greens.\n19 We've given up the common greens.      So just by way of\n20 compromise, Your Honor, Michelin agreed to give some\n21 other tires because he wanted -- the Plaintiffs wanted to\n22 compare different sizes so they agreed to give us as set\n23 out in the Rule 11 Agreement which I'll be glad to give\n24 you.   They agreed to give up six P metric tires and two\n25 light truck tires.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0039\n\f                                                              34\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  The letter specifically says this\n2 agreement is limited to this matter and may not be\n3 revealed outside of this case or used by any party in any\n4 matter.    It's not right to be doing what he just did.     It\n5 was a compromise like we should have compromise this case\n6 before we came in here today.\n7                  Mr. Price is -- he's got a mechanical\n8 engineering degree.     He worked at MARC, Michelin of\n9 America Research and Development Corporation, for a\n10 number of years as a tire designer.   He is now in the\n11 litigation department.   His qualifications are set out in\n12 the affidavit and the affidavit speaks for itself and\n13 it's uncontroverted.\n14                 MR. BLACKERBY:   Your Honor, can I just\n15 speak about the law real quick?\n16                 THE COURT:   Yeah.\n17                 MR. BLACKERBY:   They've cited the Exmark\n18 case.   We've cited in our brief the In re Cooper Tire\n19 which deals with this same exact issue and if you -- I\n20 don't know what they call it now -- shepherdize.\n21                 THE COURT:   Yeah.\n22                 MR. BLACKERBY:   If you go on Westlaw or\n23 whatever and you do that, guess what, decline(phonetic)\n24 to follow by In re Cooper that case and in In re Cooper\n25 what the court is deciding if when you get discovery on\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0040\n\f                                                             35\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 these other tires that don't have the same design that\n2 they're a different tire than the one at same issue and\n3 this was on a mandamus proceeding the Court of Appeals in\n4 Houston said no you don't because they established it as\n5 a trade secret and you have to -- and it doesn't because\n6 it's just relevant it has to be -- it's necessary for the\n7 fair adjudication of claims.    You use the same kind of\n8 affidavit that we have in this case proving it up as a\n9 trade secret.    And once you've done that the burden\n10 shifts.   And the language on the shifting burden is\n11 pretty pointed both by the Dallas Court of Appeals and\n12 the Houston.   Both Court of Appeals have talked about\n13 this and it's not supposed to be -- you can't satisfy it\n14 by general assertations [sic] of fairness or relevance.\n15 What you have to do is you must demonstrate with\n16 specificity exactly how lack of this information will\n17 harm the presentation of the case.    So you won't have a\n18 fair opportunity.    That's what they call for.   Once you\n19 establish it's a trade secret.    That's what we've done in\n20 this case so the burden has shifted.    We try to do some\n21 negotiation and part of the processes in these cases is\n22 all of these are trade secrets.    We know they need\n23 something so we negotiated with them.    That's why I have\n24 been yelling at them to please confer.    We'll come up\n25 with something.   But in the absence of it, we have our\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0041\n\f                                                              36\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 trade secret.    We've proved it all up as trade secrets.\n2                  THE COURT:   Well the conferring didn't\n3 work out so good.\n4                  MR. BLACKERBY:   Yeah, I agree with you.\n5                  THE COURT:   Well, I don't know why he\n6 would want to confer if it didn't work out so good.       It\n7 come to the same conclusion and the one tire is what\n8 y'all want to get.    Well, y'all didn't want to give that\n9 but --\n10                 MR. BLACKERBY:   Well we've expanded.\n11                 THE COURT:   Well you don't want to give\n12 any.   I mean that's --\n13                 MR. BULLION:   We recognize they're\n14 entitled to that, Your Honor.    And you know this is --\n15 this is not about discovery fights.   I've tried -- I've\n16 tried eight cases for Michelin similar cases to this\n17 involving tires and Blackerby and I are not into\n18 discovery fights.   We want to try the case.   And he's\n19 going to accuse us of just being discovery hounds, but we\n20 are interesting in trying cases.    We like to give them\n21 the documents they are legitimately entitled to, to allow\n22 them to prosecute their case and get on down the road.\n23                 We think given the State of the record\n24 though that what we've offered is more than fair.

I'm not from here.    I get it.   It's fine.\n10 It's par for the course.     But he said this letter that I\n11 used from Ms. Helms says anything about being protected\n12 the letter that letter I used says absolutely nothing.\n13 That's a misrepresentation to the Court, Your Honor, they\n14 I couldn't use.\n15                 THE COURT:    Well, is that part of the Rule\n16 11?\n17                 MR.

I've got an e-mail back as a local\n15 lawyer accepting -- there was effective equivalent of a\n16 Rule 11 Agreement in Arizona.\n17                MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor.

I'm not done.\n11                 MR. BULLION:    It will probably be hundreds\n12 of millions, Your Honor.\n13                 MR. GUERRA:    I'm not done.     Your Honor,\n14 the general principal which is the basic document that it\n15 tells all these folks how to manufacture and inspect\n16 these tires and repair the tires before they leave the\n17 factory.   It specifically says that applies to all.\n18                 THE COURT:    I'm not giving you all tires,\n19 okay.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    No.   No.\n21                 THE COURT:    You've argued it.\n22                 MR. GUERRA:    No.   No.   No.   I only want\n23 the LTS and then --\n24                 (Simultaneous speakers.)\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor -- I think there\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0047\n\f                                                                 42\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 is a rule.     I think there's a little confusion that I\n2 think I can clear up very easily.      Aspect specification\n3 is a plant document.     That's a document that we use at\n4 the Dothan plant.\n5                  Mr. Guerra is right, it is not tire line\n6 specific.    The manufacturing documents by definition are\n7 not going to be.     They're going to apply to whatever\n8 tires are being made at the time at the plant.\n9                  THE COURT:    Whatever is rolling off.\n10                 MR. BULLION:    What we're talking about\n11 here in terms of this scope is design documents and\n12 adjustment data and he doesn't -- and, you know, with all\n13 due respect, Your Honor, we can't just willy-nilly expand\n14 this without any proof.    He doesn't have any prove\n15 whatsoever.    The proof is in the form of an affidavit or\n16 a live witness or a document that's admitted into\n17 evidence.   And he does not have any proof whatsoever that\n18 would support expanding beyond what we've offered to give\n19 which is this tire line during the time frame that it was\n20 made at Dothan, Alabama.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    That's not true, Your Honor.\n22 They preclude me from having the documents and then want\n23 to say that the documents prove that.\n24                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   No.   What he's\n25 saying is you hadn't put on any evidence for this\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                               MR 0048\n\f                                                                43\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 hearing.   Tell me what the evidence for the record what's\n2 the evidence --\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    The owners manual.\n4                 THE COURT:    What's the evidence?\n5                 MR. GUERRA:    The owners manual is the\n6 same.\n7                 THE COURT:    All right.   That tells us --\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    The aspect specifications\n9 it's a pile of documents, Your Honor, that state on the\n10 first page apply to all light truck tires.      The general\n11 principal its says on the page 17, I think, that applies\n12 to all light and truck tires.    They don't make this\n13 distinction.   This sounds letter on the Velo case, I saw\n14 it, Your Honor.   The warranty claims -- the document\n15 itself doesn't make a distinction.    The passenger -- this\n16 is from Michelin.    The warranty claims -- the thousands\n17 of warranty claims for the defect on the tires the same\n18 across the board for all light truck tires.      These are\n19 people on are the field after the tires left the plant\n20 and failed on the field, Your Honor.      So they prevent me\n21 from having documents that would prove that and then say\n22 come up with proof.\n23                THE COURT:    All right.   On those warranty\n24 claims, what are the sizes?\n25                MR. GUERRA:    Warranty claims --\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0049\n\f                                                                 44\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    Yeah, what are the sizes?\n2                   MR. GUERRA:    All I want is the LTX M/S's.\n3                   THE COURT:    I have already told you,\n4 you're not getting every LTX M/S.       That's too broad.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, give me the 225s\n6 through 265s.\n7                   THE COURT:    255 to 265?\n8                   MR. GUERRA:    225 to 265.\n9                   THE COURT:    225 to 265?\n10                  MR. GUERRA:    On Velo I have 235s, 245s --\n11                  THE COURT:     All right.    I get it.   I get\n12 it.\n13                  MR. GUERRA:    So all I want is the same,\n14 Your Honor.\n15                  THE COURT:    I get it.   You are going to\n16 tell me into something less.      Tell me why 225, 265\n17 wouldn't be similar.\n18                  MR. BULLION:    It's trade secret, Your\n19 Honor.    And he has not yet come forward with any proof.\n20 They're different design.      Each tire size is made to a\n21 different spec and Mr. Price is very specific in his\n22 affidavit.    In paragraphs 19 they really -- if you are\n23 inclusive 17 through 22.\n24                  THE COURT:    What's the next one after 225?\n25                  MR. GUERRA:    I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0050\n\f                                                                  45\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    What's the next one, 235?\n2                   MR. GUERRA:    235.\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yeah, there's a 225, 235.\n4                   (Simultaneous speakers.)\n5                   THE COURT:    All right.   235 to 265.     225\n6 is getting pretty small for my rudimentary knowledge of\n7 tires dealing with trailers and --\n8                   MR. BULLION:    And you're talking P metric\n9 tires as opposed to LT metric tires, I assume, Your\n10 Honor.    This is a P metric tire.\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    That's fine.    Your Honor.\n12                  THE COURT:    Yeah.   Now from there where do\n13 we go.\n14                  MR. BULLION:    Your Honor -- we.\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    We have an issue with the\n16 aspects.\n17                  THE COURT:    Wait.   Wait.   Wait.     I asked\n18 them.\n19                  MR. BULLION:    We are -- just going through\n20 the letter to Exhibit C to our response, Your Honor.\n21 We've agreed to produce the oldest available copies of\n22 the general principals, technical notes and not tire\n23 marks (phonetic), informed procedures.         It's my\n24 understanding that the Plaintiffs have agreed to accept\n25 that.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0051\n\f                                                                  46\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    The oldest they got.   It\n2 sounds like a pretty good start.\n3                   MR. GUERRA:    One down.\n4                   MR. BULLION:    Aspect specifications.    We\n5 have a dispute, Your Honor.       And that's the document he\n6 has shown you a couple of times.        Aspect specifications\n7 are used by the people that are called plaspectors\n8 (phonetic).\n9                   THE COURT:    Okay.   You would only have\n10 those as they relate to the sizes I gave you.\n11                  MR. BULLION:    Well, this is not a size\n12 issue.\n13                  THE COURT:    I understand what you're\n14 saying, but there's got to be a way to correlate it,\n15 isn't there?\n16                  MR. BULLION:    Here's what we typically do\n17 in these cases, Your Honor and what we think is\n18 reasonable.\n19                  THE COURT:    All right.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    There are aspect\n21 specifications that deal with a lot of things.        Aspect\n22 specifications are just documents that are reference\n23 documents for the people who are inspecting the tires\n24 after they're cured.\n25                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0052\n\f                                                               47\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. BULLION:   And there may be a blemish\n2 on the side wall.    There may be a white side wall that\n3 has got a blemish on it and they go to a category for\n4 that.\n5                  THE COURT:   Okay.\n6                  MR. BULLION:   Or maybe there's any number.\n7 It's a stack about this big.\n8                  THE COURT:   Yeah.\n9                  MR. BULLION:   And what we typically do and\n10 we've done in this case is we get the Plaintiff to\n11 identify the components of the tire that are at issue and\n12 we give them aspect specifications related to that.\n13                 For instance, the expert I assume they're\n14 using whom Mr. Blackerby and I are very familiar with has\n15 a theory where regard to steel belts.     There was a gap\n16 belt splice that should have been butt to butt.     There\n17 was not belt splice.\n18                 THE COURT:   Okay.   So ordinarily you would\n19 argue that your aspect material sheet should be limited\n20 to those that deal with the --\n21                 MR. BULLION:   Plaintiff's theories in the\n22 case.\n23                 THE COURT:   The ply, the belt.\n24                 MR. BULLION:   Well, not just that, but\n25 just any theory that have in the case we have done that\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0053\n\f                                                             48\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 and we have provided those to them.\n2                 THE COURT:    What about that?\n3                 MR. BULLION:    They are super trade secret,\n4 Your Honor.   And again, we felt we've proven them up as\n5 trade secret and we're happy to give them the ones that\n6 relate -- not happy to be blunt, but we are willing to\n7 give them the ones that relate to the case, but we don't\n8 think we should have to give them something that relates\n9 to a B when there's never a B allegation in this case.\n10 So that's our whole issue.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    So, Your Honor, on that issue\n12 you heard it has nothing to do with the tire size, the\n13 rim size or pressure size.    It's just across the board on\n14 light truck tires.    Therefore, on Velo I add exactly the\n15 same conditions that I had on this one minus a few.    So\n16 on the Medina case I have more conditions at issue than\n17 on the Velo case.    I got more than 60 aspect\n18 specifications, Your Honor.    I got more issues --\n19                THE COURT:    All right.   You need to tell\n20 me I'm not going to give just a blanket aspect sheet for\n21 everything in the world.    So how are these --\n22                MR. GUERRA:    His aspect specifications\n23 relates to a specific defect on the tire, Your Honor.\n24                THE COURT:    Okay.\n25                MR. GUERRA:    First we have --\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0054\n\f                                                                49\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    I'm not giving them every\n2 defect.\n3                  MR. GUERRA:    Not saying that I wanted to.\n4                  THE COURT:    I understand.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    I want a little less than\n6 that but I know at least 63 apply because on the Velo\n7 case we have exactly the same issue a few less in fact\n8 and we got 63 of them so I want all of the Velo ones and\n9 you know it has nothing to do with the tire size.       The\n10 tire was manufactured on the same plant manufactured on\n11 the same year on the same line.     I should at least get\n12 those 63.   I think that's the ones I got in Velo plus I\n13 have more issues on this case and they have a specific\n14 problem.\n15                 THE COURT:    Well, no.   Look.   The way to\n16 go is not just to say, well, they did this in another\n17 case.\n18                 MR. GUERRA:    Okay, Your Honor.\n19                 THE COURT:    I might as well let Mr. Fisher\n20 wear the robe if I'm going do that and trade places.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    I can do that, Your Honor.\n22 They gave me the document.     This is the issue that I have\n23 and they also have it in Velo.\n24                 THE COURT:    Here's what I'm going to do to\n25 you unless can you talk me out of it, all right?\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0055\n\f                                                                50\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   MR. GUERRA:    All right.\n2                   THE COURT:    I kind of buy his argument the\n3 Plaintiffs got to say the defect that they're -- but then\n4 again that leaves no room for the possibility and that's\n5 part of discovery is taking a fresh look at it because\n6 there maybe have been something else.\n7                   MR. GUERRA:    That's fine.\n8                   THE COURT:    So how I do get there?\n9                   MR. GUERRA:    How I do get there, Your\n10 Honor?\n11                  THE COURT:    No how do I get there not how\n12 do you get there.    Because how you get there is going to\n13 be different from how I get there.      How you get there you\n14 would get all the aspects sheets --\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    And I should, Your Honor.\n16                  THE COURT:    And all the LTMS tires.   I get\n17 it.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    This has nothing do with\n19 specific lines.\n20                  THE COURT:    But you and I don't agree with\n21 that.\n22                  MR. GUERRA:    This has nothing to do with\n23 specific lines and I'm not done Tom.\n24                  MR. BULLION:    I was just going to\n25 volunteer a solution.    But we have a plane to catch and\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0056\n\f                                                               51\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 all.   I have a proposed solution.\n2                 THE COURT:    Well, let me hear it.\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    Go ahead.   Let me hear it.\n4                 MR. BULLION:    We talked in chambers about\n5 giving him a list of the aspect specifications and let\n6 him pick them and it came clear to me that he was going\n7 to pick all of them and I didn't think that was fair.\n8 I'll agree on behalf of Michelin give him a list and he\n9 picks the ones that are really at issue in the case.       If\n10 he comes back and picks all of them I think the Court\n11 ought not tolerate that and it seems like to me that's a\n12 fair compromise.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, again, the\n14 characterization is I'm the bad guy.      I gave him this --\n15                THE COURT:    You know I'm not taking it\n16 that way.\n17                MR. GUERRA:    That's nonsense.\n18                THE COURT:    I understand you are.\n19                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I told him what I\n20 needed.   I told him exactly what I needed.     I need all of\n21 the aspect specifications about blisters.     I need all of\n22 the aspect specifications about defects on the moldings,\n23 defects on the inner line, defects in the junctures\n24 between material, defects in the joints, defects\n25 regarding the sticking of the joint.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0057\n\f                                                                  52\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    And that's going to be\n2 everything, right?\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yeah.\n4                   MR. GUERRA:    No, no, it's not everything,\n5 Your Honor.     It's not everything.      I just know these\n6 documents but it's not everything.         Defects in the bead\n7 defects in the tread and they said to me, Luis you have\n8 an allegation about the bead.       I said, no.   And I said,\n9 but I always see when I go against tires the bead is\n10 always the issue so I'm waiting for that and I'm not\n11 willing to sit on it and then you make that allegation on\n12 the defense side.    There was a problem with the bead and\n13 I have to come back and ask for the documents.\n14                  THE COURT:    What's wrong with that?\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    Timing.   Timing.   Timing.\n16 It's been going on a year.      But, Your Honor, I asked the\n17 gentlemen here to provide me the factual basis of this\n18 defense that the tire -- tire abuse that's the defense,\n19 tire abuse.    And he has refused to give me the factual\n20 basis, Your Honor.    So I'm fighting in the dark.      I\n21 submitted three letters talk about not complying with the\n22 rules.    He said that's the expert disclosure.     It's not\n23 the expert disclosure.    It's the factual basis for the\n24 defense before the expert disclosure.       I need to know\n25 that.    I have allowed them to take deposition after\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0058\n\f                                                              53\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 deposition.   I don't know what I'm defending against so\n2 here is the problem.\n3                 THE COURT:   Hold on.   I get it over there.\n4                 MR. BULLION:   I'm sorry.\n5                 THE COURT:   I get his argument over there.\n6 You know I could see you put it together then all of a\n7 sudden your guy comes in and says, well, really.      It was\n8 something else totally out there and I had limited his\n9 discovery to where he can't even defend against that\n10 affirmative defense.\n11                MR. BULLION:   I understand what you you're\n12 saying, Your Honor.    I've never seen this being an issue.\n13 I will tell you generally what our position is in the\n14 case, but I don't think it is an expert issue.    We don't\n15 have company witnesses who talk about why this tire\n16 failed.\n17                THE COURT:   I understand.\n18                MR. BULLION:   Our position is this tire\n19 was 11 years old at the time of the accident and it\n20 should not have been in service.   There were five\n21 different tires on this vehicle.   It was an expedition.\n22 There was a light truck tire on it.    There were 4P metric\n23 tires and they were a horrible mess of tires.    These\n24 folks should not have been driving with these on this\n25 vehicle.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0059\n\f                                                                54\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  And there is going to be plenty of proof\n2 at the appropriate time that this tire was run\n3 underinflated.      Probably there's going to be proof that\n4 it suffered an impact which caused its failure.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    No it's not.\n6                  MR. BULLION:    This is all expert stuff\n7 that --\n8                  THE COURT:    Well, wait a minute.   Wait a\n9 minute.   He just went through a litany of them.      They're\n10 all on the record.     You get aspect sheets related to --\n11                 (Simultaneous speakers.)\n12                 MR. GUERRA:    Wait.   I don't get all of it.\n13 Let me explain.    Let me explain why.\n14                 THE COURT:    No, I've been hearing you.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor.   If I\n16 may.   If I may.   Tire inspectors, the verifiers, tire\n17 verifiers that do this day in and day out they cannot see\n18 all of these defects and they're experienced people.\n19 They need all the aspect specs to compare.      Why am not\n20 entitled to have that to compare to see if there's\n21 initial defects.     They are so precised as defects, Your\n22 Honor, that they don't even let you make color copies of\n23 the photographs.     They have to be colored laser copies of\n24 the photographs because of preciseness.       So I'm entitled\n25 to all the aspect specs for these truck tires so I can\n\n\n                      VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0060\n\f                                                             55\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 compare to see if there's any defects that we miss.      Why\n2 can't we have that for this specific tire, Your Honor?\n3 It has nothing to do with other tires -- this tire.      Give\n4 meet the aspect specs so my expert and we can take a look\n5 at what should be.\n6                 THE COURT:   What was the year of the\n7 manufacture of this tire?\n8                 MR. BULLION:   2001.\n9                 THE COURT:   What happens with all the\n10 aspect sheets for 2001, 2002 and 2000?\n11                MR. BULLION:   We probably don't have\n12 those, Your Honor.   What we typically would give would be\n13 the oldest available.    They're not going to be\n14 appreciably different.\n15                THE COURT:   All right.\n16                MR. BULLION:   The question is not the date\n17 I don't think in this case.   It's there are -- I don't\n18 know, this many --\n19                THE COURT:   Okay.\n20                MR. BULLION:   I'm showing 3 inches maybe.\n21                THE COURT:   Oldest available two years\n22 what does that do to you?\n23                MR. BULLION:   It's not -- again, it's not\n24 the date.   It's just having to give up all of them.    What\n25 we ought to have to give up -- if there's anything --\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0061\n\f                                                                 56\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  (Simultaneous speakers.)\n2                  THE COURT:    It's defects.\n3                  MR. BULLION:    If there's anything --\n4                  THE COURT:    It's defects.\n5                  MR. BULLION:    But a lot of them don't\n6 relate to anything having to do with what they claim in\n7 this case.   He for example-- he wants the one relating to\n8 B.\n9                  THE COURT:    Yeah, but y'all got a whole\n10 bunch of allegations against the Plaintiffs that you just\n11 went through.\n12                 MR. BULLION:    But --\n13                 MR. GUERRA:    For the first time.\n14                 MR. BLACKERBY:    These documents are used\n15 in the plant to look at tires that have just been cured.\n16 These have not been used to look at tires that are 11\n17 years old and have been run down on a vehicle.\n18                 THE COURT:    Well, I understand.    But it\n19 would certainly go to discovery of issues that were\n20 potentially that were out there and that way they can\n21 look at these tires in the context of these defects.        But\n22 I didn't want to give 10 years of all that massive\n23 documentation because I just think it's irrelevant and\n24 too much now.\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Well the issue is trade\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0062\n\f                                                                57\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 secret though.    That's the problem we have with this\n2 whole deal.   If we give them the aspect specifications\n3 that relate to the claims in the case and it can be\n4 relate to the defenses too that's fine.       There won't be\n5 anything I think on what I just said.      But if we give\n6 them the aspect specifications that relate to the claims\n7 in the case, then we'll concede that that's necessary for\n8 a fair adjudication of the claim.       When you get beyond\n9 that then we're back in the mode of the In re Continental\n10 tire case where we have proven this --\n11                 THE COURT:   Oldest two years.\n12                 MR. BULLION:   I'm sorry.\n13                 THE COURT:   Oldest two years.\n14                 MR. BULLION:   Okay.   You want us to you\n15 give them all of them, huh?\n16                 THE COURT:   The oldest two years.\n17                 MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, one thing I\n18 didn't -- you said 235 through 265 but we didn't talk\n19 about a date range.   I would urge the court on that if\n20 what he wants to do is be able to compare to limit it to\n21 a narrower date range like maybe plus or minus six months\n22 as opposed to it's going a ton of documents if you give\n23 him those sizes for the five years that we offered plus\n24 there's a reason -- there's a basis for the '98 to\n25 2003 time frame with regard to the tire in question on\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0063\n\f                                                               58\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 this case because that's when it was made there.      I would\n2 urge you to either pick.\n3                   THE COURT:   Two years forward or two years\n4 after.     That's what we're going to start with.\n5                   MR. BULLION:   I'm sorry.\n6                   THE COURT:   Two years before or two years\n7 after the manufacturing year.\n8                   MR. BULLION:   That's going to be a ton,\n9 Your Honor.     That's going to be a whole lot.    I can come\n10 back to you and tell how it's -- just printing these\n11 specs takes a lot of time.\n12                  THE COURT:   All right.   What about six\n13 months before and the year after to start.\n14                  MR. BULLION:   Okay.   I don't know how much\n15 effort that will be frankly, but I will put six months\n16 before and one year after.\n17                  With regard to the aspect specification,\n18 Your Honor, I want to make sure that I'm being clear.\n19 Giving up two different versions of it --\n20                  THE COURT:   I don't know what you're\n21 talking about two different versions.\n22                  MR.

GUERRA:    Coca-Cola doesn't kill\n8 people.     These tires kill people, Your Honor.   We are\n9 talking about the ability to hold materials together.        We\n10 have a claim for that.    We cannot know whether or not\n11 that product can do it.    You can't test.   You can't do\n12 anything.    You can put the claim out there, but you can't\n13 do anything about it.    You cannot conduct any discovery.\n14 How is that fair?

I know that Vielica has been working admirably\n21 and she has explained it to me.     And I think she going to\n22 it available shortly so you can just read it and just\n23 issue the order regarding some of the disputes that we\n24 have here.\n25                THE COURT:    Yes.   That's what I'll do.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0074\n\f                                                                  5\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    Concerning Your Honor --\n2 here's the problem that I have in a nutshell.      On\n3 March 30th you gave us until December 15 to produce the\n4 expert opinions.     That is about from March 30th -- I'm\n5 sorry -- April 30th.    You gave us -- on April 30th you\n6 gave us the Court's scheduling order until December 15th\n7 to produce the expert's opinions.     And that is, Your\n8 Honor 229 days.\n9                 Of those 229 days I am supposed to conduct\n10 discovery, get the information.    I have not been able to\n11 do that.   I was here on May 11 asking for documents.\n12                THE COURT:    I understand.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    I've been here on September\n14 8th asking for --\n15                THE COURT:    So what is it that you want to\n16 do?\n17                MR. GUERRA:    I those documents and I want\n18 the documents they promised to produce.      And so they\n19 promised prior to the hearing to give me -- that's the\n20 letter to us -- general principals, the technical notes,\n21 the tire nonconfirming procedures and the oldest\n22 available tire building training document for tires.\n23 Then they came to the hearing on September 8th and they\n24 promised again that I would get all that stuff.     Then\n25 they wrote a letter to you on September 17th saying\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0075\n\f                                                                 6\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 again, despite that proposal on September 1st to produce\n2 additional documents Plaintiffs used a --\n3 (unintelligible) --their offer, despite that we agree\n4 during the hearing to produce the documents any way.         So\n5 three times they have told them.        They told us, they told\n6 you, they've made judicial declarations.       We're going to\n7 produce them.     I don't have them.     I don't have -- all I\n8 have out of those documents, I have the general\n9 principal.    That's it.\n10                  They produced incompletely the tire\n11 nonconforming.    There's no qualifications on what they're\n12 going to produce.    There's no qualifications.    We will\n13 produce --\n14                  THE COURT:    Well, but isn't this part of\n15 what we all, I mean what whey went through?\n16                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your Honor.\n17                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    I don't have the documents.\n19                  THE COURT:    Well, I'm sure they're going\n20 to say we're waiting on the order and y'all don't agree\n21 to the order.    I'll go over the order as soon as we get\n22 the transcript.    And if this creates a problem for the\n23 December, your time will be extended.      That's the way\n24 it's going to be.\n25                  MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I don't want to\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0076\n\f                                                                  7\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 lose my trial date.     I do not want to lose my trial date.\n2 I have spent 70 percent of the time -- 70 percent of the\n3 time -- some this I've been up to today 158 days of those\n4 229.     This is the traditional traditional litigation\n5 strategy of this company.      On May 11 when I was here I\n6 stated that I'm already having problems, Your Honor.        I\n7 know that's the way they work.      So out of my time that I\n8 have to conduct discovery on the merits of the case, I\n9 have spent 70 percent of my time --\n10                 THE COURT:    Yeah, but if your concern is\n11 over the amount of time you have to commit to accomplish\n12 your discovery, you're not going to have a problem with\n13 that.\n14                 MR. GUERRA:    Okay.   Okay.   All I need is\n15 the documents really so can I conduct my discovery.      In\n16 the meantime --\n17                 THE COURT:    As soon as I get the\n18 transcript, I will read it over and do the order since\n19 y'all couldn't agree to what the rulings were.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Some of these documents they\n21 claim, Oh, we agree to produce them so and it's not even\n22 part of the order.    We agreed to produce them.     No, it's\n23 got to be on the order because they promised they would\n24 produce them.   So if they don't produce them and when I\n25 find through the witnesses they didn't produce these\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0077\n\f                                                                  8\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 documents, I can come back here and talk to you about\n2 these matters, Your Honor.\n3                  MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, it's not correct\n4 that we're waiting on an order to produce documents.\n5 It's not correct.    We have produced --\n6                  THE COURT:   Well, if you produced all\n7 those that he's got his poster on and he'd said that\n8 y'all agree to produce then there's nothing to argue\n9 about.\n10                 MR. BULLION:   He is wrong, Your Honor.       He\n11 is wrong.    We made a proposal as the Court will recall a\n12 week before the hearing on September 8th we made a\n13 proposal.    He has excerpted part of it on the board that\n14 he has got there.   And it was we will produce certain\n15 documents in an effort to resolve this motion to compel\n16 and you withdraw your motion to compel.      They didn't\n17 accept it.   They called it BS as you'll recall.    They\n18 didn't accept the offer.\n19                 Despite that we came in, in good faith at\n20 the hearing and we said we'll agree to produce these\n21 documents.   We have produced almost 5,000 pages of\n22 documents.   Now we have produced the documents.\n23                 THE COURT:   Are you saying that you have\n24 already gave him what he is talking about on that poster?\n25                 MR. BULLION:   Yes.   That's what I'm\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0078\n\f                                                               9\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 saying.\n2                 THE COURT:   Okay.   Then he can say what he\n3 wants.    If you've already gave it him, you gave it to him\n4 and you will be sitting good.     He don't think you did and\n5 he's going to have to prove that.\n6                 MR. BULLION:   The only thing, Your Honor,\n7 is I understand that the motion for sanctions that he\n8 filed only relates to thing that are not things the Court\n9 ordered us to produce, but things that we voluntarily\n10 offered that we would produce.   We have not produced\n11 documents relating to the other tire sizes that the court\n12 ordered because, again, we are waiting on the order on\n13 that.\n14                THE COURT:   I understand.\n15                MR. BULLION:   Aspect specifications,\n16 expanding aspect specifications, we have not produced\n17 that.\n18                THE COURT:   I understand.\n19                MR. BULLION:   But with regard to the\n20 documents that we said in that proposed Rule 11 Agreement\n21 that we will produce on September 1 even though he didn't\n22 accept it, we have produced those.    There are certain of\n23 those documents that he is complaining about in the\n24 motion that don't exist that we have said it in our\n25 responses.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0079\n\f                                                                 10\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Sounds easy.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    I wish it was.\n3                   MR. BLACKERBY:    We agree I think it should\n4 be easy, but it has not been.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, it's absolutely\n6 not true.   They have not produced a single technical\n7 note.   It's right here; not a single one, not a single\n8 one tire nonconfirming --\n9                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, how are you going\n10 to prove that?\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    They have told me.    They have\n12 told me they have not produced them.\n13                  THE COURT:    Have y'all not produced a\n14 single technical note?\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    Not a single technical note.\n16                  MR. BULLION:    Technical notes, Your Honor,\n17 are referred to in certain aspect specifications.       You\n18 will recall briefly at least what the aspect\n19 specifications are.    They're the documents that --\n20                  THE COURT:    Yeah, I remember --\n21                  MR. BULLION:    Class spectors use in the\n22 final finish department.      Certain of the aspect\n23 specifications have technical notes associated with them\n24 certain of them don't.   The ones that we have produced in\n25 the case today, he did not.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0080\n\f                                                              11\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    It's an easy question.   He\n2 says you have not produced a single technical note.\n3                 MR. BULLION:    We have, Your Honor.\n4                 THE COURT:    You're saying, yes, we have.\n5                 MR. BULLION:    There are no technical notes\n6 associated with the aspect specifications we have\n7 produced today.   If we --\n8                 THE COURT:    Okay but if there are just\n9 none because there is none created then that's why you\n10 have none.\n11                MR. BULLION:    We've said that in our\n12 responses.   The Court has ordered that we produce\n13 additional aspect specifications --\n14                THE COURT:    Yeah, and you're waiting for\n15 an order.\n16                MR. GUERRA:    All of them.\n17                MR. BULLION:    And when we do that --\n18                (Simultaneous speakers.)\n19                THE COURT:    I understand.\n20                MR. GUERRA:    Here we are, Your Honor.     He\n21 said he will produce them.    He told you --\n22                THE COURT:    No.   No.\n23                MR. GUERRA:    He said I will produce all\n24 the documents that he had here.\n25                THE COURT:    And he has.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0081\n\f                                                              12\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    He hasn't.\n2                 THE COURT:    He says on his aspect size\n3 those don't have technical levels.\n4                 MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.\n5                 THE COURT:    On the remaining ones he is\n6 waiting for the order that there are some that have\n7 technical notes.\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.\n9                 THE COURT:    I don't know that to be\n10 factually true or incorrect.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    In general, Your Honor, there\n12 are no qualifications here or here or in the courtroom.\n13 There were no qualifications.\n14                THE COURT:    Well, no, I'm not going to\n15 suggest -- I'm not going to entertain that they agreed to\n16 produce every technical note that they've ever had or\n17 anything -- that's a little broad.\n18                MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.   It's\n19 concerning the aspect specifications.\n20                THE COURT:    That's what I just said.   He\n21 gave you the aspect specifications.   He said they don't\n22 have technical notes.   The other ones are subject of the\n23 order.   And he says soon as the order comes down, they'll\n24 be some that have technical notes.    I don't know if\n25 that's true.   I'm just saying that's what he's telling\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0082\n\f                                                                  13\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 me.   Isn't that what you're telling me?\n2                   MR. BULLION:    That's exactly right, Your\n3 Honor.\n4                   THE COURT:    All right.    You may know\n5 different but you need to give me proof.\n6                   MR. GUERRA:    If we came here during the\n7 oral argument and the court ordered for them to produce\n8 all of the aspect specifications it's on the record.           And\n9 the aspect specifications --\n10                  THE COURT:    That's one of the things y'all\n11 disagree with.    That's one of the things y'all disagree\n12 with.   That's why there's not an order signed.       You think\n13 I ruled certain ways.   He thinks I ruled other ways.\n14 We're going to get the transcript.         And if you're right,\n15 then he may have a problem.      If he's right the way he\n16 heard it, then what he's telling you --\n17                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, part of the\n18 problem is they have the documents.        We don't have the\n19 documents.\n20                  THE COURT:    I know that.\n21                  MR. SHAPIRO:    So you're telling us to\n22 prove what we don't have.      How do we do that?\n23                  THE COURT:    No.   No.   You said you've got\n24 no technical notes.    He says I understand for the aspect\n25 specs that we've given you voluntarily --\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                               MR 0083\n\f                                                                14\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. GUERRA:     They gave us nine aspects,\n2 nine, Your Honor.\n3                  THE COURT:    Exactly.   That's fine.   He's\n4 saying there's no technical notes for those.       Now if you\n5 can prove, yes, there are.       There are technical notes for\n6 all those then you would be showing me that what he\n7 saying is not correct.     He says the other things that\n8 would include and have technical notes are subject of the\n9 order.\n10                 MR. GUERRA:     Your Honor, they play this\n11 game in every single litigation parsing things that were\n12 said.    Your Honor, it's the strategy that they use, Your\n13 Honor.    The general note --\n14                 THE COURT:    What do you want me to do?\n15 You want me to take this and say you've got to give them\n16 some technical notes because --\n17                 MR. GUERRA:     All of the technical notes;\n18 not some, all of them.    All of it, Your Honor.\n19                 THE COURT:    I done asked you.   If your\n20 argument is they have got to give you every technical\n21 note that has ever flown past Michelin no matter what,\n22 that would be a little broad.\n23                 MR.

That's where you and I -- that's what you and\n4 I are doing.    I get it.   I hear your argument.   You want\n5 me to accept as a fact your position on what I've\n6 ordered.    He wants me to accept as a fact their position\n7 on what I've ordered.\n8                  He says if their position is right, he's\n9 given you all the aspects --\n10                 MR. GUERRA:    No, he hasn't, Your Honor.\n11 He hasn't.\n12                 THE COURT:    Show me one piece of evidence\n13 for the aspect sizes he's given you, technical notes\n14 exist and he didn't give it to you.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I came here on\n16 September 8th because I don't have the aspect\n17 specifications that I need.     We wasted another month on\n18 this nonsense that have 200 aspect specifications.       We\n19 have already heard this argument, Your Honor.      You\n20 ordered them produced -- what's clear as daylight.\n21                 THE COURT:    Y'all don't agree to what I\n22 ordered.   As soon as I get the transcript, I'll read it.\n23 One of y'all is going to be right and one of y'all is\n24 going to be wrong.   Maybe y'all will both be a little\n25 right, y'all both will be a little wrong.    Any way you\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0085\n\f                                                                16\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 will get an order.     And if there are -- if it comes the\n2 way you think I've ordered, then he probably has a lot of\n3 technical notes from what you're telling me he needs to\n4 give.\n5                 If it comes out the way he thinks the\n6 ruling was, he says he's good and you will be getting\n7 technical notes because some of the information that he\n8 thinks I ordered will be associated with technical notes,\n9 right?\n10                MR. BULLION:   Exactly.\n11                MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, on the tire\n12 building training, we don't have any of them.      These\n13 folks that start at Michelin they don't just start\n14 building tires.   They're trained.   We don't have any of\n15 them, not a single one.\n16                THE COURT:   Any what?\n17                MR. SHAPIRO:   The tire building training,\n18 how they build the tires.\n19                MR. BULLION:   We given them a ton of --\n20                (Simultaneous speakers.)\n21                MR.

We have referenced in our\n25 supplemental discovery responses what we have produced\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0086\n\f                                                                17\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 specifically.    Without an order from the Court we\n2 produced 3,000 approximately more pages of documents\n3 since that hearing.     We've referenced in our responses\n4 what we produced and they can go -- if they're willing to\n5 read it, they can go and find the documents we have\n6 produced.     We have produced our builder.    We've build\n7 machine setup type documents and tire builder training\n8 documents.\n9                  THE COURT:   You said you got no tire\n10 builder training.\n11                 MR.

SHAPIRO:   We want the orientation\n9 documents.\n10                 THE COURT:   No.   No.   You started off with\n11 tire training information.\n12                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Yes.\n13                 THE COURT:   That's what I want you to\n14 Bates Stamp range.\n15                 MR. BULLION:   Just backing up just\n16 briefly, Your Honor.   We produced a lot of documents.      We\n17 produced them even before we supplemented our discovery\n18 responses --\n19                 THE COURT:   If they're Bates stamped just\n20 tell them ranges.\n21                 MR. BULLION:   I am.\n22                 THE COURT:   And then you're going to look\n23 at that and if none of that is tire training information,\n24 bring it to me.   If it's not tire training information, I\n25 guess you overlooked and it's going to be a problem.

My apologies.\n6                   These folks here -- for instance, Your\n7 Honor.    They say that they produce all these documents.\n8 They don't produce the most important.        That is the\n9 tactic.\n10                  THE COURT:    Okay.   We are waiting on the\n11 order.\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    So the tire nonconforming\n13 procedures we know for a fact they are missing.      First of\n14 all, we just got them 14 days ago, but they're missing\n15 all of the reference documents contained on the ones that\n16 they produced.    They proved TNC2s and 3s but they didn't\n17 produce the reference documents associated with it.        In\n18 addition, Your Honor, they didn't produce TNC4s and 5s.\n19 They claim they didn't exist then.\n20                  Now they have to deal with those\n21 complaints at the same time at the time that the tire was\n22 manufactured which were already complaints and after the\n23 tires left the factory.    Those are 4s and 5s.    So --\n24                  THE COURT:    What do you want me to do?\n25                  MR.

I'm going\n4 to go through the transcript.      I'm going to give you that\n5 order.   This wasn't part of the order.       All of this that\n6 you're bringing up wasn't part of --\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    No.    Because they agreed with\n8 it.   They agreed to produce them and here I am again\n9 another 58 days into --\n10                 THE COURT:    He just told me he produced\n11 them.\n12                 MR.

I promise you.\n22                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n23                 MR. BULLION:    We have asked them, what is\n24 your problem?   What is it that you think we haven't\n25 produce and they don't respond.       When they finally put in\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0090\n\f                                                                21\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 their motion for sanctions what they claimed we hadn't\n2 produced, the TNC4 and 5, we wrote a letter and said,\n3 Hey, it here is why you don't have TNC4.       We were able to\n4 erase original equipment tires.      This is a replacement\n5 market tire.     Here is why you don't TNC5.    It didn't\n6 exist at the time.\n7                  We have explained this to them and asked\n8 them to withdraw their motion for sanctions yet they\n9 don't do it.\n10                 The reason, Your Honor, there are so many\n11 miscommunications in this case.     We feel like everything\n12 needs to be put in writing and we have requested and that\n13 I'm going to stick with that position.\n14                 THE COURT:    I can't blame them.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    These folks we call them more\n16 than 15 times after this hearing.     They refused to take\n17 the calls, refused to take the calls even discuss it.\n18                 THE COURT:    That's all right.   Send it in\n19 writing then.    I've been in your shoes then send it in\n20 writing.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, we have send them\n22 in writing.    They know exactly what we want.    They just\n23 hide the ball and then pretend that we gave you 5,000\n24 documents.    None of them include this nonsense.    It's\n25 missing, Your Honor.   They do this on every game.

GUERRA:    I don't.\n5                 THE COURT:    We went through all of that\n6 because you said we've got all of these things they're\n7 supposed to give us.   They didn't me and went through a\n8 whole big hearing.    I made an order.    Y'all don't agree\n9 with what that order was.     I'm going to go through the\n10 transcript and I'll give you the order.\n11                He says they're going respond.    I'm sure\n12 they are because they don't have much choice and then you\n13 will know where you are.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    On the Velo case which they\n15 refer to it several times.    It was a very similar tire\n16 which was LTX M/S manufactured at same plant different\n17 size was a 265 as opposed to 255, but other than that was\n18 exactly the same.   The tires are exactly manufactured the\n19 same way.\n20                I got many more aspect specifications,\n21 many many more and I have the same exact defects plus\n22 more on this one.\n23                THE COURT:    So maybe when I do my order\n24 and they do their response based on the order you will\n25 have that same treasure troll.

GUERRA:    Your Honor, I just want what\n3 was ordered here after we had the oral argument about\n4 that matter and I want the matters that they promised me\n5 that they will produce so I didn't put it on the other\n6 argument and I think I am entitled to that.         There is\n7 absolutely no qualifiers anywhere about what they're\n8 going to produce and they now after we did that -- they\n9 do this in every case, Your Honor.\n10                THE COURT:    Wait a minute.      We're going\n11 round and round.    He said they produced it.      You say they\n12 didn't.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    He didn't.\n14                THE COURT:    Well what's the proof.      He\n15 says they don't exist.\n16                MR. GUERRA:    No.    No.   No.   What they say\n17 is that they didn't exist at the time, but there has to\n18 be some way to deal with that matter; complaints after\n19 the original equipment for the original equipment\n20 customers.   It's the same tire.     So I need to --\n21                THE COURT:    Look.    Here's the deal.   He\n22 says on the record they don't exist.       They don't exist.\n23 Bring me in one that show they don't exist and that's\n24 going to somewhat problematic for him.\n25                MR.

He says no they don't.\n3                  MR. GUERRA:    Can you just incorporate on\n4 the order for them produce the documents so then I have\n5 an order that I can go against.\n6                  THE COURT:    What documents?\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    All tire nonconfirming\n8 procedures to be produced, technical notes to be produced\n9 concerning these aspect specifications.       That's all I\n10 need and the tire building documents.      Just put it in the\n11 order, Your Honor.\n12                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, you have already\n13 said multiple times you are going to read the transcript\n14 and prepare an order that reflects your rulings and we\n15 trust that you'll do that.     He keeps referring to\n16 agreement.   The September 1 document was written as a\n17 Rule Agreement.   It has a place for a signature for\n18 Mr. Guerra and Mr. Shapiro here.     They never signed it.\n19 It says in exchange for the production agreed above --\n20                 THE COURT:    It doesn't matter.   Like I\n21 said it's not a Rule 11.     It's not signed.\n22                 MR. BULLION:    There was not an agreement\n23 despite that we produced a lot of documents.\n24                 MR. GUERRA:    What not signed but he came\n25 into the court and said that I'm going to produce them.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0094\n\f                                                               25\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    If he did that it's on the\n2 record.\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    It's on the record.   And\n4 then --\n5                 THE COURT:    Y'all obviously don't agree.\n6 Why do we keep going around on this.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Because he is saying -- now\n8 he is trying to go back on his word.      He said it in open\n9 court.    He then said it here despite what we said.   We\n10 agree to again to produce the documents any way.\n11                THE COURT:    You said it's on the record.\n12                MR. GUERRA:    It's on the record.\n13                THE COURT:    Okay.   I told you I'm going to\n14 go based on what the record was.\n15                MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, they're here\n16 asking for sanctions against us and it doesn't relate to\n17 the Court's ruling.   They say in footnote note one of\n18 their motion it does not relate.     This motion does not\n19 address the documents the Court ordered Michelin to\n20 produce.\n21                THE COURT:    The Court can award sanctions\n22 based upon representations and, you know, representations\n23 in writing you know that's possible.     But right now I\n24 don't -- until I read that transcript, you're telling me\n25 all that matter that's on your posters it was stated on\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0095\n\f                                                               26\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 the record.\n2                  MR.

GUERRA:    I am going produce them any\n6 way.\n7                  THE COURT:    Well then we'll deal with\n8 that.     If it's on the record, it's going to be there.\n9                  MR.

GUERRA:    During the hearing we\n12 agree -- during the hearing we agree to produce the\n13 documents any way.    He wrote it.     That's a letter to you,\n14 Your Honor.    That's the representation he made to the\n15 Court.\n16                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                 MR. GUERRA:    It's here.   It's on our\n18 record right here.\n19                 THE COURT:    I'll look at it.   When he gets\n20 an order he is waiting on the order.      He's a got right to\n21 do that.\n22                 What else?\n23                 MR.

I've done hundreds of these.     This is the first\n2 one we've had to have a hearing on.     But if you want to\n3 take that up, we'll be glad to do that.        Mr. Blackerby\n4 will address that.\n5                 THE COURT:    Is it timely?\n6                 MR. BULLION:    Oh yeah.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes, sir.\n8                 MR. BULLION:    It's been set.    It's been\n9 filed a long time ago.\n10                MR. BLACKERBY:    It's pretty simple pretty\n11 straightforward.    We've -- the owners and the operator of\n12 the vehicle were the Rico family.    We went out and\n13 deposed the Ricos and about 10 days later we filed a\n14 motion to designate them as responsible parties.       This is\n15 what happens in every single tire case.       The allegation\n16 is they properly maintained the tire and the allegation\n17 is the driver failed to maintain control of the tire.         We\n18 should be good.    The objection that they are allowed to\n19 make is we didn't complete it.    The sufficiency to\n20 special exceptions.    They filed an objection and instead\n21 of doing that, their objection is it is baseless and\n22 unsupported and they have given a lot of testimony\n23 primarily from actually all leading questions by the\n24 Plaintiffs saying you took care of the tire, right, yes\n25 and all these kind of sayings and basically that's their\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0097\n\f                                                                 28\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 objection which is not a proper objection you know.\n2                   THE COURT:   Not for -- not at this stage.\n3                   MR. BULLION:   Not at this stage.\n4                   THE COURT:   Maybe at the time of\n5 submission --\n6                   MR. BLACKERBY:   Exactly.\n7                   THE COURT:   -- when the evidence is before\n8 the court as to whether or not there's anything that\n9 would raise the issue of responsibility but not just on\n10 just designating.\n11                  Response.\n12                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, first of all\n13 Mr. Blackerby actually asked the questions about the\n14 tire.   He didn't like the answer.    The driver and the\n15 owner of the vehicle and the tires say I had the tires\n16 checked.   So they're just completely -- it's sad to say\n17 they're making up facts.      There's no evidence of poorly\n18 maintaining the tire and it goes hand and hand with our\n19 motion to strike claims of tire abuse.\n20                  They won't disclose it.     We keep asking\n21 them.   You know it's just trial by ambush.     We keep\n22 asking them.   We provide the vehicle.     We send them the\n23 tire.   They had the tire for over a month.     They looked\n24 at everything.    We gave them the vehicle.    They deposed\n25 the driver, all the folks, nothing.     There's no tire\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0098\n\f                                                                29\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 abuse.     We ask -- we're taking fact discovery.    We're\n2 taking depositions.    They claim there's tire abuse.       They\n3 don't tell us how, where, when, nothing.      They have to\n4 plead some specificity under the rule that we cited, Your\n5 Honor.\n6                  And even if there is a claim of only\n7 checking the tire once, how does that cause the tire to\n8 fall apart.    There's no causation.   Even if can the take\n9 the pleadings as true so their motion to designate does\n10 fail.    There's no evidence of responsibility.    We've\n11 asked them for it.\n12                 THE COURT:   All right.\n13                 MR. BLACKERBY:   I'll respond, again, Your\n14 Honor.    The amount evidence is not at issue here.   It's\n15 whether we've pled it.   What we've pled is they checked\n16 the air pressure one time and they never had the tire\n17 inspected during the time they own the tire.      That's our\n18 allegation.   We'll see what the evidence says but that's\n19 what they testified to during his deposition.      A lot of\n20 the other things and a lot of the other evidence that\n21 we'll have to support either tire abuse claim or service\n22 history is going to come from expert.     We've looked at\n23 the tire and we do expert disclosures.     They'll get those\n24 in theory just like we'll get what their expert says\n25 caused the tire to fail when we get their experts and\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0099\n\f                                                               30\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 disclosures.     So that's the rest of it and they'll get\n2 all that.     That's the way these cases go and we are\n3 following procedure today.\n4                  MR. GUERRA:   Your Honor, we have that\n5 motion on that issue.     I would like talk a little bit\n6 about it.\n7                  And the is these folks said it was tire\n8 abuse but it's like saying your tire failed because there\n9 was a defect.     That wouldn't fly.   I need to give some\n10 specificity.    The same goes for them.    They say tell us\n11 what it is.    What is the tire abuse -- anything; not all\n12 the evidence.    They don't have too much, but they need to\n13 put facts.    They have not put a single fact, not one.\n14                 Maintenance demanded the tire for a month.\n15                 THE COURT:    All right.   I understand your\n16 argument.    I understand your argument.\n17                 MR. GUERRA:   And on that month it went to\n18 the shop; undisputed evidence.    So all this lack -- even\n19 if that were the case-- lack of maintenance for a month\n20 even though it went to the shop as recommended by\n21 Michelin, checked the tires, looked at them and said that\n22 they all look good; how does that go into the fact that\n23 the tire came apart and there was tire abuse?     We don't\n24 have one single fact of tire abuse.\n25                 THE COURT:    All right.   I'll look at it.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0100\n\f                                                                31\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 What else?\n2                 MR.

We need to depose that\n6 folk that came here with the affidavit.\n7                 THE COURT:    On the trade secret stuff.\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    Yeah.    And, Your Honor, we\n9 just got that stuff.\n10                THE COURT:    You get to depose him.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you.   Your Honor, I'm a\n12 little concerned about deposition dates.      Because the way\n13 this has been going, no documents, no witnesses, no\n14 contacts, I sense it's going to be a lot of problems to\n15 get deposition.   I have sent them a letter on Friday --\n16                THE COURT:    When are you going to take\n17 this guy's deposition?\n18                MR.

BULLION:    The next couple of weeks.\n23                THE COURT:    Is that a problem?\n24                MR. BULLION:    I have to check his\n25 availability, Your Honor.    I don't need to be there for\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0101\n\f                                                               32\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 them, but certainly I would think we would get it done by\n2 the end of the month.\n3                  THE COURT:    All right.

You're not striking\n13 our defense entirely.\n14                 THE COURT:    Oh I thought y'all were\n15 arguing that on the designated responsible third parties.\n16                 MR.

I don't have any notice\n23 about what --\n24                 THE COURT:    I don't than I'm going strike\n25 it, but -- y'all are probably going have to plead a\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0104\n\f                                                                35\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 little bit more.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    The way that this typically\n3 plays out in these cases, Your Honor, is the expert\n4 will -- and I will just give you an example.         There is a\n5 concept known as compression roots in the B area of a\n6 tire that there is proof according to some experts that\n7 the tire has been run underinflated or overdeflected.          If\n8 there is evidence on this tire of that which I think\n9 there is our expert in his report would say this tire has\n10 a history of overdeflected operation and here are the\n11 conditions.   It's all expert stuff.       This isn't a -- this\n12 is --\n13                  THE COURT:    But still basic notice in\n14 pleadings in Texas they are probably entitled to\n15 something a little more than a whatever y'all said this\n16 has been used.\n17                  MR. GUERRA:    Tire abuse.\n18                  THE COURT:    Just like the flip side the\n19 Plaintiff says you are negligent.\n20                  MR. GUERRA:    Exactly.\n21                  THE COURT:    You know in a special\n22 exception, you're going to have to put a little bit more\n23 meat on the bone than you're negligent.        The same thing\n24 with it's been abused.\n25                  MR. BLACKERBY:    Right.

I will tell you what\n2 we've alleged is that they were negligent in the\n3 maintenance and the driving of the vehicle.      That all\n4 came in before we went out and deposed Ricos.     And then\n5 once they deposed them, we did our motion to designate\n6 responsible third party, where we specifically said\n7 they're negligent because they didn't check the pressure.\n8                 THE COURT:    Yeah, but that's a motion for\n9 designated parties --\n10                MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, he is rearguing\n11 the same motion.\n12                THE COURT:    That's not your pleading.\n13                MR. BLACKERBY:    I'm actually -- I'm not\n14 actually regarding the same motion.\n15                THE COURT:    I understand what you are\n16 saying.\n17                MR. BLACKERBY:    We put it out there.\n18                THE COURT:    What answer you are you on?\n19 Do you have an amended answer?    I don't remember what\n20 iteration you are on, on your plea -- are you still on\n21 your original answer?\n22                MR. BULLION:    No.   I think it's our\n23 amended answer.    But also they want is for us to update\n24 our responses to request for disclosures I think is the\n25 vehicle they have been going at.

You need\n5 to amend your pleadings within 10 days on what abuse is.\n6                MR. SHAPIRO:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n7                MR.

GUERRA:    Yes.\n19                THE COURT:    Y'all come up here.\n20                MR. GUERRA:    Out of the six motions, I was\n21 wanted to see if we can maybe the motions that we filed\n22 to quash your depositions and the motion that you filed\n23 to quash Wischhusen's deposition maybe that's something,\n24 you know, in between this hearing we can take a\n25 five-minute break, we can go outside and talk and work it\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0112\n\f                                                                 5\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 out.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    Well neither one of those\n3 are set for a hearing properly.         We didn't get -- you\n4 sent a notice of the hearing on your motion to quash\n5 yesterday afternoon which is not timely pursuant to the\n6 Texas rules.    But the way the Texas rules work is the\n7 depositions are automatically quash if you file a motion\n8 within three days of the notices so I'm happy to take\n9 that up or not whatever your preference is on that, Your\n10 Honor.\n11                  THE COURT:    I would certainly rather hear\n12 those type of issues rather than make either one of y'all\n13 come back or spend additional time on something that's,\n14 you know, motions to quash depositions are easy to talk\n15 about.   It doesn't take a lot of -- not a lot of facts a\n16 lot of time, you know.   So I would rather deal with that\n17 today if we can get it dealt with.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    Tom.\n19                  THE COURT:    But y'all can take a break and\n20 talk about it.    I am going to be here.      It don't matter.\n21 I'm willing to entertain them.      If he's going to make a\n22 notice if Mr. Bullion makes a notice objection then we'll\n23 deal with that.   But I would prefer to deal with those\n24 deposition issues.\n25                  MR.

GUERRA:    And what I was suggesting Tom\n3 is that since this just seems to be mostly calendaring\n4 issues we could probably take five minutes and talk on\n5 the phone and try to resolve it really quick and come\n6 back and talk to the Judge on what we agree upon.\n7                  MR. BULLION:    Whatever you want to do.\n8 With regard to the depositions that we noticed.\n9                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.\n10                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, I got a stack of\n11 e-mails and letters conferring on dates and we never got\n12 a response and we noticed the depositions up and they\n13 quashed them and we've asked them.      We said this is\n14 Mr. Bustillo.    He's the codefendant and the trooper and\n15 some fact witnesses and we've been trying since July to\n16 get those scheduled and we surprisingly we have not been\n17 able to do that.\n18                 MR. GUERRA:    Tom --\n19                 THE COURT:    Well, that's all right.     We'll\n20 get them scheduled.    I got a way to handle that if y'all\n21 can't agree.    So y'all are going to talk about it and\n22 we'll take that up after we discuss it but we will get\n23 that set up today.\n24                 MR.

I told\n3 y'all how I'm going to handle this.\n4                 MR. GUERRA:    I can argue back, Your Honor.\n5                 THE COURT:    No, you can't.   Let's go to\n6 the next thing.   I told you how we're going to do this.\n7                 MR. SHAPIRO:    So we're going to talk to\n8 him on the phone.\n9                 THE COURT:    Yeah, and then we'll come back\n10 in here.\n11                MR. SHAPIRO:    Perfect.\n12                MR. GUERRA:    You want to do that right now\n13 or do that at the end.\n14                THE COURT:    No let's take care of that.\n15                MR. GUERRA:    Tom, we're going to be\n16 outside for a second to talk to you.\n17                THE COURT:    No.   No.\n18                MR. SHAPIRO:    No, he wants to do the\n19 motions.\n20                MR.

So then we also\n24 have the motion for the --\n25                MR. SHAPIRO:    The Bates range regarding\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0115\n\f                                                                  8\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 the tire training.\n2                   MR. GUERRA:    Did you hear that, Tom?\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yes.    We've given you the\n4 Bates number for the tire builder training documents and\n5 I don't know -- I don't if you want to take that up or if\n6 you're good with that.\n7                   MR. SHAPIRO:    No, Your Honor.   And Tom, in\n8 fact that was October 5th when the Judge ordered the\n9 Bates range to be produced we got it on Friday because\n10 the first time it was set on Monday he gave us the wrong\n11 Bates numbers.    So, you know, we looked at the Bates\n12 numbers and we looked at the Bates ranges and these are\n13 not tire training documents.      I have for example, the\n14 first Bates range document that Mr. Bullion represented\n15 was a tire training document.      It's a work instruction.\n16 It doesn't mention training anywhere on there, Your\n17 Honor.\n18                  THE COURT:    Wait.    What about that,\n19 Mr. Bullion?   I want you to give him the tire training\n20 documents.\n21                  MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, we've given them\n22 the documents that are used to train tire builders.        A\n23 lot of them are documents like work methods and things\n24 like that.   They don't say tire builder training on them,\n25 but those are the in fact the tire builder training\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0116\n\f                                                                9\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 documents that were available and that we used and given\n2 them.\n3                   THE COURT:   Well, it don't have to say it\n4 on there.    But if it is what was used and what was relied\n5 upon as documents for that purpose, it doesn't have to be\n6 headed or title that.    So I don't have a problem with\n7 titling.\n8                   MR. SHAPIRO:   I don't have a problem with\n9 title either.     The problem is in previous cases by the\n10 way, in Velo, these same documents were produced and they\n11 were called work instructions.     Now they're calling them\n12 tire building training.    They're not tire building\n13 training and I can show it to and you there is nothing\n14 about how the tire is built.\n15                  THE COURT:   Hold on.   What you want was\n16 the tire training, right?\n17                  MR. SHAPIRO:   That's right.\n18                  THE COURT:   All right.   He's saying he\n19 provided that.    What Bates range, Mr. Bullion?\n20                  MR. BULLION:   Let me look real quick, Your\n21 Honor.   This is as we discussed before this -- this was\n22 in our supplemental responses and in our response to a\n23 motion for sanctions.   I've got to pull this motion up.\n24 It is -- let's see, in the 3362 through 3515 it's about a\n25 little over -- a little over 150 pages of documents.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0117\n\f                                                               10\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:   And that's supposed to be\n2 responsive to the tire training.\n3                  MR. BULLION:   Yes, Your Honor.\n4                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, they're not tire\n5 training.\n6                  THE COURT:   Okay.   But what do you want?\n7 Do you think I know?\n8                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, the problem is\n9 we don't have the documents.      They have the documents.\n10 So I can't tell what you they look like because they've\n11 never produced them to us.\n12                 THE COURT:   I understand but --\n13                 MR. SHAPIRO:   And that's the problem.\n14 These are not tire training documents.\n15                 THE COURT:   Wait a minute.   Listen to me.\n16 All right.    He has represented to you that's what they\n17 are, right?    So he is bound by that representation.    You\n18 say it's not.    Okay.   There's a way to deal with that,\n19 right?\n20                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah, there is a way to deal\n21 with that which kind of segues into the next motion which\n22 is about a person who is responding to discovery, the\n23 employee, because the employee would know --\n24                 THE COURT:   Wait.   Wait.   You're getting\n25 ahead of the deal.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0118\n\f                                                              11\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. SHAPIRO:   I'm not trying to get ahead.\n2                  THE COURT:   I know.   Understand y'all are\n3 in this.    Y'all know.   Y'all know what these documents\n4 are.   I don't know.   So I hear this gentlemen from\n5 Michelin, Mr. Bullion say, Gave these, gave everything we\n6 got responsive what you told us to you give on tire\n7 training.   Here they are Bates range M3362 through 3515\n8 easy for me to identify, know what those are.     It can be\n9 not a problem.    And you say that's not what that is.      And\n10 he says, Yeah, it is.    So where do we go from there?\n11                 MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, might I suggest\n12 that we've offered the deposition.     They've sent us a\n13 they sent us several letters asking for depositions of\n14 representatives of Michelin and we offered the deposition\n15 of the manufacturing witness from Dothan and I've offered\n16 a couple of days for it and they have not yet noticed it\n17 and it seems to me that they have -- if they don't think\n18 these are in fact tire builder training documents the way\n19 for them to develop that is to ask the manufacturing\n20 witness from Dothan what was used to train tire builders\n21 back in this time frame and are these the documents and\n22 are there other documents out there and I'm assuming at\n23 some point they're going to take their deposition.\n24                 THE COURT:   Not a bad idea.\n25                 MR. BULLION:   I offered them\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0119\n\f                                                                12\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 November 13th --\n2                  THE COURT:    Hold on.    Would you hold on --\n3                  (Simultaneous speakers.)\n4                  THE COURT:    Can you not hear me?\n5                  MR. BULLION:    I can hear you, Your Honor,\n6 mostly.\n7                  THE COURT:    Can you not hear me?\n8                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor, I can hear\n9 you right now.\n10                 THE COURT:    Well I asked you to stop\n11 talking in the middle of that.\n12                 MR. BULLION:    Again, I apologize, Your\n13 Honor.   I apologize if I talked on top of you.\n14                 THE COURT:    All right.    Now what about\n15 taking that deposition?\n16                 MR. GUERRA:    Here is the problem.   Here is\n17 here is the manufacturing guy and we don't have documents\n18 that we have questions to ask.      Not these documents.     The\n19 other documents the aspect specifications.\n20                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   Listen to what he's\n21 say.   Listen to what he's saying.\n22                 MR. GUERRA:    I did.\n23                 THE COURT:    No, you didn't.   Because he is\n24 saying you trot down here and you take the deposition of\n25 the person who knows whether or not these are the\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0120\n\f                                                              13\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 documents.\n2                 MR. GUERRA:    I understand, Your Honor.\n3                 THE COURT:    Okay.   That's not the same\n4 thing as what you're talking about.      Now that would be a\n5 costly deposition.\n6                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes.\n7                 THE COURT:    And if that guy were to say\n8 this range that has 33 through 62 -- 3362 through 3515.\n9 If he were saying, for instance, that's some of it or not\n10 all of it or if he says, no, that's not the tire building\n11 training documents, Bullion is going to pay for all of\n12 that.   He is going to pay for your time to go down there.\n13 He is going to pay the whole turnkey deal because he's\n14 the one making the representation that these are the\n15 responsive documents and then he's saying, Well, if you\n16 don't believe me, go talk to the people and they'll tell\n17 you that these are the responsive documents.     And if you\n18 go down there and you go through that and the guy says,\n19 No, it's not all the responsive, Bullion is going -- he\n20 is the one making the representations to the Court.\n21                Now if they say, yes it is and you're like\n22 good and you're able to come in and prove somehow that\n23 they're not, it starts getting pretty serious Rule 215\n24 stuff in Texas.\n25                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, the issue is, you\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0121\n\f                                                                14\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 know, we're trying to schedule the deposition and we know\n2 the man, Mr. Riley, in Alabama, but there's other\n3 documents unrelated to the training documents related to\n4 the inspection of the tires that we've been able to\n5 receive them.     So our thinking -- and that's Mr. Bullion\n6 I give him the dates, no.       Until we get the documents we\n7 cannot be setting depositions of these folks willy-nilly\n8 until we get the basis for us to prepare to go take the\n9 depositions.    I understand what you're saying.\n10                  THE COURT:    I don't think you do.\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    It's a little different.\n12 You're saying, Luis, go down there.      Talk to this guy and\n13 if anything --\n14                  (Simultaneous speakers.)\n15                  THE COURT:    It's calling the bluff.\n16                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.   Yes.   I get it.\n17                  THE COURT:    It's calling the bluff and\n18 like I say I do this from the position that y'all both\n19 have been involved in these cases before.       Y'all both\n20 know these documents.   It's not like you've never seen\n21 these documents before.    It's not like Mr. Bullion has\n22 never seen these documents before.       You know it's calling\n23 somebody's bluff.\n24                  For instance from Mr. Bullion's position I\n25 leave room for the possibility that he's like they know\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0122\n\f                                                                15\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 these are the documents and they're just trying to get\n2 that Judge down there to throw something else in when\n3 they know these are the documents.     Maybe that's what he\n4 believes.    And then he's calling your bluff.     He's\n5 calling your bluff saying, Well, you don't think so.\n6                 Hook'em on down here.   Talk to this.\n7 Because you know you know he gone say, yeah, that's all\n8 we got.   Those are the documents.    And then you didn't\n9 get anymore from me through this exercise than what he\n10 gave you.   I leave that as a possibility.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    Okay, Your Honor.\n12                THE COURT:    The flip side is you've seen\n13 it.   You've seen it and they're stepping right into your\n14 analysis.\n15                MR. GUERRA:    And my caveat is, Your Honor,\n16 is, you know, I get the additional documents concerning\n17 when this gentleman is supposed to testify about when the\n18 Court makes the ruling and then I will go back and depose\n19 him about that.\n20                THE COURT:    See how that works.\n21                MR. GUERRA:    No problem.    No problem.\n22 That will be fantastic.\n23                THE COURT:    That's the way it works around\n24 here.\n25                MR.

GUERRA:    Yep.   Thank you, Your Honor.\n5                  THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, how long you said\n6 this guy would be available.      They can hot foot it on\n7 down there.     You ought to be able to have this guy\n8 available certainly within the next 30 days for sure.\n9                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor.    I don't\n10 think that's a problem at all.     I will say that I told\n11 Mr. Guerra and Mr. Shapiro that we only want to put these\n12 witnesses -- I've got four maybe five witnesses\n13 identified to cover their topics and we only want to put\n14 them up once so I would like to --\n15                 THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, hey, hey, hey.\n16 We all got wants and needs in life.\n17                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.   May I proceed,\n18 Your Honor?    What I was going to say is --\n19                 THE COURT:    I told you how we're going to\n20 do this little part of it.     We move in small fight bites\n21 around here.    Simple things for simple minds.\n22 Unfortunately you got the simple mind on the bench here.\n23 So you're going to do things in small bites and\n24 simple-minded ways, all right?\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0124\n\f                                                             17\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:   It's like Sisyphus pushing\n2 that rock up the hill.     It's just what you have to\n3 endure.   I'm not trying to the level --\n4                 MR. BULLION:    What I would like to say on\n5 the record if possibly, Your Honor, is once we get a\n6 ruling on that on that motion to compel then we will be\n7 in a position to produce the additional documents and\n8 they can ask all of these witnesses whatever questions\n9 they want to ask them with regard to all of the documents\n10 we produced.   So that is what I would like to make sure\n11 it's clear on the record.\n12                THE COURT:   Well, we'll see how it goes.\n13 We'll see how it goes.    I've got a way to go about this.\n14 It might not be the way you'd go about it.    It might not\n15 be the way opposing counsel would go about it, but it\n16 will be the way I go about it.\n17                So I don't want to get distracted with all\n18 of these other things.    It just confuses the simple mind.\n19 I have a dispute on whether or not these responsive\n20 documents have been produced.    You've been very kind to\n21 identify for the Court exactly the range and what they\n22 are and you feel very confident that those are the only\n23 ones that are responsive to the point you told him, come\n24 on down and talk to the guy.    They can either take up\n25 that invitation or not.    If they choose not to, then they\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0125\n\f                                                                18\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 have what you give them and we move on to the next issue.\n2                   Now what's the next thing?   I told you how\n3 we're going to handle this little issue about the motion\n4 to compel on the tire building training documents.         That\n5 is done and closed for the record.\n6                   MR. SHAPIRO:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n7                   MR. GUERRA:    If we can go on a segue that\n8 David was talking about.       We would like to discuss that\n9 motion regarding identification of the individuals that\n10 provided them discovery responses and the financial\n11 information.\n12                  Did you hear that, Tom?\n13                  MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n14                  MR. SHAPIRO:    And, Your Honor,\n15 Mr. Bullion's brief outlines the Exxon case which talks\n16 about -- in that case by the way the Plaintiff served\n17 several depositions and in fact they were depositions.\n18 Deponents were produced from Exxon to talk about\n19 documents.\n20                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n21                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Now what the Court denied\n22 was the production of an attorney of record to discuss\n23 the documents.    That's not what we want.    We want the\n24 employees' bios --\n25                  THE COURT:    Right.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0126\n\f                                                               19\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. SHAPIRO:    For example --\n2                  THE COURT:    Okay.    But what if the person\n3 in charge just happens to have a J.D. from one of the\n4 finer legal institutions of this country.        Just because\n5 you're a lawyer doesn't mean -- just because you have a\n6 law degree doesn't exclude you --\n7                  MR. SHAPIRO:    That's why the Court was\n8 very careful and the Court of Appeals wrote the attorney\n9 of record.\n10                 THE COURT:    Right.\n11                 MR. SHAPIRO:    And we're not looking for\n12 work products here.   We're looking for folks that\n13 actually do this day in and day out who can identify, you\n14 know for example those glass aspects.       These are how they\n15 come to that.   Those are those glass specters that\n16 Mr. Bullion talks about all the time.       They actually use\n17 those documents on the field.\n18                 THE COURT:    All right.   You want a person\n19 who has knowledge of that information with the\n20 corporation.\n21                 MR. SHAPIRO:    That's right.\n22                 THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, what about that?\n23                 MR.

What about that?\n2 Can you tell them that?\n3                 MR. BULLION:   I'm not sure I got\n4 everything.    What I understand the Plaintiffs are asking\n5 for is somebody to be deposed about our discovery\n6 responses and we've in our brief in Texas law I think\n7 it's very clear that that is not permitted.     It's work\n8 product and it's not -- it's not permitted to get to\n9 basically do discovery into discovery.     I heard him\n10 mention of class spectors (phonetic) and I am not sure\n11 what that is related to.\n12                THE COURT:   I don't hear them asking for\n13 that.   What you're hearing is different from what they\n14 are saying.   Run that by me again.   What is it that you\n15 want.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:   We want the folks that\n17 identify for example we asked for the aspect\n18 specifications.\n19                THE COURT:   You want the person who has\n20 knowledge of the aspect specifications.\n21                MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah.\n22                THE COURT:   Right.\n23                MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah, who took those\n24 conditions.   They asked for conditions at issue that\n25 we're claiming.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0128\n\f                                                                21\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    Yeah.\n2                 MR. SHAPIRO:    And they have gave us nine\n3 aspect specifications.\n4                 MR. GUERRA:    We want that the guy.\n5                 THE COURT:    You want to talk to that\n6 person who made that judgment that decision.\n7                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Exactly, Your Honor.\n8                 THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Bullion, what\n9 about that?\n10                MR. BULLION:    They're asking for somebody\n11 in the legal department, Your Honor.      The people who make\n12 decisions as to what documents are responsive to\n13 discovery requests are either lawyers in the legal\n14 department at Michelin or their representatives that are\n15 either engineers or paralegals.      And so what they're\n16 asking for is what I just said; discovery about\n17 discovery.\n18                If they want to talk to somebody about how\n19 the aspect specifications are used in the plant then the\n20 plant manager would be able to get into that.\n21                THE COURT:    No.\n22                MR. BULLION:    But if they want to get into\n23 why you picked these aspects specifications as opposed to\n24 others, that's a lawyer's decision or a lawyer's\n25 representative's decision and it's clearly work product\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0129\n\f                                                                  22\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 under Rule 192.5.\n2                  THE COURT:    That's not what they're asking\n3 for from what I'm hearing.      Here is what I'm hearing that\n4 they're asking for and they'll tell me if I've stated\n5 this wrong.     What they're asking for is based upon the\n6 answers to the discovery somebody has knowledge and went\n7 through a process of giving the responsive information.\n8 They want to know who is that person in the company that\n9 has knowledge about these -- this particular aspect\n10 information.\n11                 MR. BULLION:    I -- I think we're on the\n12 same page, Your Honor, but the people who have knowledge\n13 about that would have the use of the aspect\n14 specifications that would be the people at the Dothan\n15 plant.\n16                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                 MR. BULLION:    We offered a witness who can\n18 address the aspect specifications.        The question of --\n19                 THE COURT:    Hold on.    Hold on.    Hold on.\n20 That's what y'all want, right?\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    We want that but we certainly\n22 want the person that for these responses said these are\n23 the ones.   It cannot be --\n24                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   No.   No.   That's\n25 getting kind of gray area.     Now listen to me.      Here's the\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0130\n\f                                                                23\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 deal.     Remember small minds.    Small minds.   Simple ways\n2 for small minds.    You're going to go down there and\n3 you're going to talk to these people that he's saying\n4 know all about these aspects and then you're going to ask\n5 them how come I was given these and he is going to say, I\n6 don't know.    I don't know.     And you're going to have all\n7 kinds of good little questions about, Well, did you give\n8 this information to somebody and who did you give this\n9 information to somebody and then you will find out who\n10 the filter is.    And then maybe we will take the next step\n11 once we know what that filter is, right?\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    Sounds good, Your Honor.\n13                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Sounds good, Your Honor.\n14                  MR. GUERRA:    Simple things for simple\n15 minds.\n16                  THE COURT:    I know it tends to make things\n17 more costly, but sometimes that's only way to get to the\n18 truth.\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    One thing I also want to\n21 point out for the record is Your Honor ordered at least\n22 from the bench that we produce the oldest version of all\n23 of the aspect specifications and you said at Dothan and\n24 once you entered an order on that and we produced those\n25 and I think why certain ones were selected to be produced\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0131\n\f                                                                24\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 in discovery probably becomes moot as well.\n2                 THE COURT:    I disagree.    I disagree.   I'm\n3 not sure about your framing of that order, but the\n4 purpose was not just to say give them old irrelevant, you\n5 know, material but to give them the current responsive\n6 material and the only reason there would be an issue\n7 about old or how far back or dated is just to set a date\n8 on how far back.    Not saying you only give them old,\n9 irrelevant, out of date and, you know, none --\n10 nonmaterial information.    I don't think my order said\n11 that.\n12                MR. BULLION:    No.   No.   Your Honor, that\n13 wasn't what I was saying.    It was that this was a really\n14 old tire.   This tire was built in 2001 and Your Honor you\n15 wanted us to produce the oldest version of all of the\n16 aspect specifications in use at Dothan.      And that's at\n17 least the way we understood the order.      I think there's\n18 some disagreement on that.    So once you enter your\n19 written order, then we'll produce the oldest version.\n20 Whether they were actually in effect at the time this\n21 tire was built or newer than that I think will depend on\n22 the aspect specifications?\n23                THE COURT:    Huh, that's an interesting\n24 dance.\n25                MR. BULLION:    Well just all the aspects\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0132\n\f                                                                25\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 specifications, Your Honor, are not dated the same.         They\n2 don't have the same date on them.       Some might have been\n3 written in the late '90s.       Some might have been written\n4 in the late 2000s.    They don't have all the same date on\n5 them is all I'm trying to say.\n6                   THE COURT:    Yeah, I think what the court\n7 would probably be interested in is up until the time of\n8 the production of this particular aspect and going back a\n9 reasonable period of time all of those responsive\n10 documents not just the oldest and not just the current\n11 but it would be really from the time of production back a\n12 reasonable period of time.      Have we not done that with\n13 that order?\n14                  MR. GUERRA:    It has not been written down,\n15 Your Honor.\n16                  THE COURT:    You just got the language.\n17                  MR. BULLION:    You know Michelin has a\n18 document retention policy, Your Honor, and, you know, I\n19 think there's some confusion on what -- on what it is\n20 that you ordered us to you produce.     Because my\n21 understanding of what the oldest version of the aspect\n22 specifications in use at Dothan I think that's different\n23 than what you are saying now and I think Mr. Guerra and\n24 Mr. Shapiro have a different understanding as to what you\n25 ordered too --\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0133\n\f                                                               26\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    Yeah, listen to me.\n2                  MR. BULLION:    -- we will simply have to\n3 see the written order and see what it is that you ordered\n4 us to produce.\n5                  THE COURT:    All right.    Listen to me all\n6 right.\n7                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n8                  THE COURT:    Do you have any confusion when\n9 I say for the aspect of this tire that's the subject of\n10 this litigation I'm ordering production from the time of\n11 production of that tire back, the aspect documents on\n12 that tire or that aspect.\n13                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, I understand what\n14 you're saying, Your Honor.     And to the extent they exist\n15 we'll produce those.\n16                 THE COURT:    Yeah, I get it.   You can't\n17 create or something that doesn't exist, you don't have\n18 that, but you will set it out in there.       I'm sure you'll\n19 answer with, if they don't exist but they used to how a\n20 document retention program affected your ability to\n21 produce, right?\n22                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor.\n23                 THE COURT:    All right.\n24                 MR. SHAPIRO:    When, Your Honor?\n25                 MR. GUERRA:    When.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0134\n\f                                                              27\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    When can you get that?   What's\n2 a reasonable period of time on that, Mr. Bullion?\n3                 MR. BULLION:    Once we get the written\n4 order, I think we can get those within two weeks.\n5                 THE COURT:    All right.   We'll put 14 days\n6 from the signing of the order.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, that motion had a\n8 second issue which is the financial information.\n9                 Did you get that, Tom?\n10                MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n11                MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, in their\n12 response we're shocked that they would even challenge\n13 this because they cited that statute.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    Tell the Judge what you are\n15 looking for specifically.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:    Oh, that the witness -- the\n17 financial information of the net worth of Michelin.\n18                THE COURT:    Yeah.\n19                MR. SHAPIRO:    And they quoted the statute\n20 and it took effect on September 1st 2015, expressly,\n21 expressly wrote that this act takes effect on\n22 September 1st 2015.\n23                MR. GUERRA:    That for.\n24                MR. SHAPIRO:    So in fact it says Section\n25 3.   The change in law made by this action apply only to\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0135\n\f                                                              28\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 an action filed on or after the effective date of this\n2 act.    And, Your Honor, all of the case law we provided\n3 certainly provides and mandates for the production of\n4 this witness.\n5                  THE COURT:   What about that?\n6                  MR. BULLION:   The statute does say on it's\n7 face that it's effective to lawsuits filed after whatever\n8 date.     There is -- the Supreme Court has indicated in our\n9 brief is considering whether that should be applied\n10 retroactively and that's been briefed and it's before the\n11 Court at this point.   And I think frankly the reason that\n12 and I don't pretend to understand why the Court has done\n13 a lot of things it's done.     But I think the reason is\n14 there has been a lot of confusion as to what should be\n15 discovered and there has been a lot of abuse from this.\n16                 To the extent all you have to do is plead\n17 punitive damages and then you get to go out and do\n18 discovery as to financial information particularly with a\n19 company like this that is not publicly traded, Michelin\n20 North America Incorporated is not a publicly traded\n21 company and it's financial information is very sensitive\n22 to it.    The entire industry is very competitive and just\n23 mere allegation of punitive damages -- we don't think\n24 this is a punitive damage case and not even close.    And\n25 just to be able to allege punitives and then be able to\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0136\n\f                                                                   29\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 get a bunch of financial information from a privately\n2 held company we don't think it's fair and we think that's\n3 what the Supreme Court is likely going to find in\n4 response to this.\n5                   And from a timing standpoint they don't\n6 need early in the discovery of this case to develop net\n7 worth information on Michelin North America.          If the\n8 Supreme Court doesn't apply this statute retroactively\n9 and if the court decides that they're entitled to net\n10 worth information that is something they wouldn't need\n11 until basically until the time of trial because the, you\n12 know, there's a bifurcation statute as to punitive\n13 damages.   And the only time that net worth information\n14 would be admitted would be in the second phase of the\n15 trial.\n16                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                  MR. BULLION:    So I ask given that the\n18 Supreme Court.\n19                  THE COURT:    Hold on.   Hold on.   Hold on.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n21                  THE COURT:    What about that?\n22                  MR. GUERRA:    We have experts.\n23                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Yes, Your Honor we have\n24 experts about that.\n25                  THE COURT:    Well, yeah I understand.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                 MR 0137\n\f                                                              30\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 That's an issue of you don't want to get short-haired on\n2 the expert and say the Court say, Oh, the expert deadline\n3 is cut off and all that.      That's not going to go down\n4 that way.\n5                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, it's important\n6 to know that first off this is a punitive damage case.\n7                  THE COURT:   Well, how I do know that?\n8                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Hold on a second.   The\n9 reality is when we're talking about early discovery,\n10 we're talking about just over a month.     It's just over a\n11 fact discovery.   Your Honor, that's really no time to\n12 waste.    That is the law and the law is on our side.    They\n13 have not -- but that's great the Supreme Court is\n14 considering this, but they haven't.    And in fact right\n15 now the statute I don't think it could be more clear\n16 honestly.    The change of law made by statute applies\n17 only --\n18                 THE COURT:   All right.   Until the Supreme\n19 Court tells me something different I'm going to go by the\n20 statute, Mr. Bullion.\n21                 MR. BULLION:   So are you -- is your order\n22 then, Your Honor, that we put up a witness to discuss\n23 this or that we respond to an interrogatory or what?       I\n24 think the lawyers are supposed to use the least obtrusive\n25 means to do the discovery.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0138\n\f                                                             31\n                      Various Motions' Hearing\n                          November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, we asked for the\n2 deposition.\n3                 THE COURT:    I'm going to let him take the\n4 deposition, but I do buy your confidentiality issue.       So\n5 we've got to have a way --\n6                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, for the record I\n7 might ask you to stay that order in the event that we\n8 decide to take that up to the Court of Appeals.       Are you\n9 going to put a deadline on the deposition or how do you\n10 want to do that?\n11                THE COURT:    Yeah, when do y'all want the\n12 deposition?\n13                MR. GUERRA:    As soon as possible.\n14                THE COURT:    How do you want me to do it,\n15 Mr. Bullion?   And I will stay if y'all chose to seek\n16 review because I think this is an important issue for\n17 your client.\n18                MR. BULLION:    Typically the way I've seen\n19 requests for depositions handled is they would send their\n20 notice of the deposition and we would file a response\n21 with objections to it.\n22                THE COURT:    Okay.\n23                MR. BULLION:    But I would ask you to stay\n24 you know I understand what the Court's ruling is but I\n25 would ask you to stay it pending a filing of the petition\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0139\n\f                                                             32\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 for writ of mandamus to the Dallas Court of Appeals.\n2                 THE COURT:   I will when that's filed.     So\n3 here is what we're going to do.    I'm going to order that\n4 this be taken no less than 30 days.    That way you got a\n5 certain time period that you have to deal with.    And then\n6 if you chose to seek the writ of mandamus, I will stay\n7 the discovery on the net worth while you do that.\n8                 MR. BULLION:   Okay.   Would it be okay,\n9 Your Honor, for you to order that they notice the\n10 depositions so that we'll have an opportunity to file a\n11 response with objections to it before we have to take it\n12 up if we do?\n13                THE COURT:   Yeah, I think that's the way\n14 procedurally that it ought to be done and for a record to\n15 be clear that there was a deposition notice and request.\n16 I'm ordering that they serve y'all with that and I'm also\n17 ordering that it be done, and no less than 30 days from\n18 the service of that notice for the deposition of the\n19 person with knowledge of relevant facts regarding the net\n20 worth.   And then if you file -- if you serve notice and\n21 file a writ from mandamus on that issue, I will stay the\n22 deposition until the Court of Appeals has addressed that\n23 issue.\n24                MR. BULLION:   Thank you, Your Honor.\n25                THE COURT:   All right.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0140\n\f                                                                33\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    The next one up, Your Honor,\n2 is the motion regarding indecipherable design documents\n3 which is these documents.     We can't read them without the\n4 code keys for the codes and the acronyms and that's the\n5 issue.\n6                 Did you hear that, Tom?\n7                 MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n8                 THE COURT:    What about that, Mr. Bullion?\n9                 MR. BULLION:    There is no code key.   It's\n10 set out in our response, Your Honor.     I have been doing\n11 this for a really long time and I have never seen a\n12 motion like this ever.   What happens is when we produce\n13 documents that have acronyms and Michelin uses a lot of\n14 acronyms and some of them are based on French words\n15 because the parent company is a French company.\n16                Well happens is they take the documents to\n17 the deposition or the design witness and they say, What\n18 does FE mean, what does GI mean and he says sidewalk,\n19 tread.   I mean there is not a document to produce it and\n20 it would be improper in the Texas rules just to create\n21 some kind of a code key.\n22                THE COURT:    Hold on.   Hold on.   No, I'm\n23 not going to compel you to do that.\n24                How do you think I'm going to handle this\n25 now.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0141\n\f                                                                34\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:     Your Honor, I will say\n2 that --\n3                 THE COURT:    No.    How do you think I'm\n4 going to handle this now?\n5                 MR. GUERRA:    Take the deposition.\n6                 MR. SHAPIRO:     Take the deposition.\n7                 THE COURT:    See.    You will take the\n8 person -- the deposition of the person with Michelin that\n9 has knowledge of these acronyms and these keys.       It has\n10 gotta be a person with Michelin that does that or knows\n11 that, right Mr. Bullion?\n12                MR. BULLION:     I don't know that there\n13 would be one person, Your Honor.      I mean some of these\n14 documents are design documents and some of the documents\n15 are manufacturing documents and the way that it would be\n16 typically happening is on a manufacturing document.        They\n17 would ask the manufacturing witness that they're deposing\n18 this witness any way about the quality control processes\n19 and the manufacturing processes and they would ask them\n20 what does this acronym mean --\n21                THE COURT:    No.    Mr. Bullion.\n22 Mr. Bullion.   Mr. Bullion --\n23                MR. BULLION:     -- if they want to know want\n24 to know acronyms they would ask that witness.      I don't\n25 know that there's a -- I don't know --\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0142\n\f                                                               35\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion.\n2                   MR. BULLION:   -- I don't know that there\n3 is any one person that you could go in and give every\n4 single definition of every abbreviation that's used on\n5 the --\n6                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion.\n7                   MR. BULLION:   -- on all these productions\n8 documents.   We produced thousands of pages -- yes, sir.\n9                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion, I guess you can't\n10 hear when you are talking.\n11                  MR. BULLION:   I think it's -- I'm on the\n12 speaker phone.    It somehow mutes the other side.   If I\n13 talked on top of you again, I apologize.\n14                  THE COURT:   Okay.   Here's going to be the\n15 deal.   Michelin is a corporation or a legal entity.    It's\n16 bound to have somebody that knows these acronyms and\n17 keys.   It may not anybody that knows them all.    It may be\n18 several people with Michelin's knowledge, but I found it\n19 hard to believe that Michelin somehow don't know what\n20 everything in these documents means whether it's an\n21 acronym, an abbreviation or code or whatever.     So you're\n22 going to produce the person or persons who have knowledge\n23 of what these codes and acronyms mean in the documents\n24 that you've produced or you will -- and you will identify\n25 those acronyms so forth that nobody in Michelin knows\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0143\n\f                                                              36\n                      Various Motions' Hearing\n                          November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 what it means.    You understand?\n2                  MR. BULLION:   Yes, sir.   Can I ask for\n3 clarification?\n4                  THE COURT:   Yeah.\n5                  MR. BULLION:   And I alluded to this\n6 earlier, but they sent us a number of letters with topics\n7 for depositions.     And I understand the Court may not --\n8 may not agree with me that it makes sense for them to be\n9 able to only depose this witness once.      But what I would\n10 like to do is I don't want to have to go to Greenville\n11 for a deposition on abbreviations and then go back to\n12 Greenville for a deposition on the design of a tire.\n13 What I would ask is if they will include that in whatever\n14 notice of the deposition of the company that they served\n15 in, then we might designate the design witnesses to talk\n16 about the design of the tire and talk about it's field\n17 performance and to talk about the abbreviations on the\n18 specs.   And we might designate the manufacturing witness\n19 to talk about the manufacturing processes and procedures\n20 and the abbreviations on the manufacturing documents.\n21                 So I'd just want to do it as efficiently\n22 as we possibly can.    And once they notice these\n23 depositions, I think maybe some of this will kind of come\n24 out in the wash.\n25                 THE COURT:   My order is that you're going\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0144\n\f                                                              37\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 to produce somebody from Michelin the person or persons\n2 who have knowledge of these acronyms, abbreviations,\n3 codes for deposition.\n4                 MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n5                 THE COURT:    If it ends up being a person\n6 who has knowledge of these four or five different subject\n7 matters, well, we will have to deal with that when the\n8 time comes, but it's not going to change the fact that\n9 I'm ordering at this time that you produce the person or\n10 people who have knowledge of the information of the\n11 abbreviation, the codes, the acronyms and the documents\n12 that you have produced to opposing counsel so that they\n13 can ask Michelin's understanding of those -- of that\n14 information in the record.\n15                MR. BULLION:    I get it, Your Honor.   Just\n16 for clarification purposes, if it turns out that we would\n17 have the design witness talk about some of the\n18 abbreviations and addition to the design of the tire are\n19 you saying that it's okay with you that that's two\n20 different depositions still on two different days.\n21                THE COURT:    Well, yeah, it may have to be.\n22                MR. SHAPIRO:    And Your Honor --\n23                THE COURT:    If y'all can work it out to\n24 where you it's not, I'm not saying it can't be.    I'm just\n25 saying that it does not have to be because simple\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0145\n\f                                                               38\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 steps --\n2                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Right.   Simple steps we're\n3 having --\n4                 THE COURT:    Really bad idea.   You don't\n5 have an idea how bad an idea that is.      Simple steps.     So,\n6 you know, we'll figure out what these codes are and\n7 whatever and then we'll see where we go on the next area\n8 of discovery.\n9                 MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n10                THE COURT:    What's next?\n11                MR. GUERRA:    Next, Your Honor, if we're\n12 going to work out the depositions motion to quash outside\n13 after we're done with this.    There is one more, Your\n14 Honor, after Mr. Bullion's motion concerning motion to\n15 designate the records as responsible third parties.\n16                Did you hear that, Tom?\n17                MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n18                MR. GUERRA:    It's Tom's motion.\n19                THE COURT:    All right.   You may proceed.\n20                MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, you are ordered\n21 after the last hearing that we plead additional facts\n22 with regard to the liability of the Ricos who were the\n23 owners and driver of the accident vehicle and we have\n24 done that and there's no question but that we have\n25 complied with Texas law with regard to the requirements\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0146\n\f                                                             39\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 of designating these folks as responsible third parties.\n2 I don't really have anything to add.       It will be\n3 reversible error in the case if they're not -- I think\n4 very clearly based on talking to my appellate people.       If\n5 they're not designated as responsible third parties, it\n6 Will be reversible error in the case.\n7                  THE COURT:    Response.\n8                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your Honor.   The\n9 arguments -- the additional arguments that they place the\n10 problem is that these facts have nothing to do with the\n11 Ricos, Your Honor.   The Ricos were using an old tire,\n12 okay, but that comes from a bulletin from Michelin.     The\n13 technical bulletin came from February 9, 2006.     We\n14 deposed Michelin employees in the past about this\n15 specific bulletin that allegedly performs that the tires\n16 that are within 10 years --\n17                 THE COURT:    Okay.   But what does it have\n18 to do with somebody being named responsible third\n19 parties?\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Because they have nothing to\n21 do with that.   The Ricos had nothing to do with that.\n22 It's alleged facts that the Ricos had anything to do with\n23 it.\n24                 THE COURT:    Well, he says that they used a\n25 tire that they knew or should have known was not safe.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0147\n\f                                                              40\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    That's not what they said,\n2 Your Honor.   They say that they used a 10-year-old tire\n3 which they depose the Ricos and the Ricos told them who\n4 inspected the tire it looked good --\n5                 THE COURT:    I know but it's not a mini\n6 trial under Texas rules.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    I understand.\n8                 THE COURT:    They may not get submitted in\n9 the body of the trial but so I'm going to grant your\n10 motion, Mr. Bullion, for the responsible third party.\n11                MR. BULLION:    Okay.   Thank you, Your\n12 Honor.\n13                THE COURT:    Anything else?   Y'all want to\n14 take's y'all's break and discuss --\n15                MR. BULLION:    The only thing I want to\n16 make sure I'm clear on, Your Honor, has to do with the\n17 on -- I think I might have gotten us offtrack a little\n18 bit on the aspect specifications, but they want a\n19 deposition of a Michelin employee to talk about\n20 discovery.\n21                THE COURT:    That's not.\n22                MR. BULLION:    I don't know what the --\n23 real clear what the Court's ruling is on that.\n24                THE COURT:    That's not what they requested\n25 at least my understanding.    That's not the way I treated\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0148\n\f                                                             41\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 it.   I've given you the ruling that I've made in that\n2 regard.    I even asked you if understood it and you said\n3 you did.    I understand what your argument is and you want\n4 it on the record.     It is on the record.    Ms. Dobbins is\n5 just taking it away feverishly.     I am not going to snake\n6 you without a record.    It is on the record that you feel\n7 like this is a deposition to try to get somebody's mental\n8 processes on discovery answers, right?\n9                 MR. BULLION:   Yes, Your Honor.\n10                THE COURT:   All right.\n11                MR. BULLION:   When they notice the\n12 deposition if they do then we will have an opportunity to\n13 file objections to it and come back before the Court.      I\n14 think I understand the Court's ruling.      I didn't mean to\n15 beat a dead horse.    I just wanted to make sure it was\n16 clear.\n17                THE COURT:   I'm not planning on you being\n18 back here for an objection.    I've ordered this deposition\n19 and you've made your objection based on you feel like\n20 it's, you know, them trying to take discovery of people\n21 who made basically a legal decisions on how to answer\n22 discovery.   Okay.   You've made that or I've overruled\n23 that objection.   I do not believe -- and especially based\n24 upon the way I've attempted and the way I have ordered\n25 it -- that it does that.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0149\n\f                                                               42\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 So you've made an objection that it's\n2 improper discovery on discovery analysis and decision\n3 making.   I've overruled your objection.     It's on the\n4 record.   And I've ordered the deposition be taken with,\n5 you know, so within.\n6                 MR. BULLION:    In light of that, Your\n7 Honor, I would ask you to stay that one as well and same\n8 procedure I would like for them to notice the deposition\n9 they want give us a chance to respond it and then I would\n10 ask you to stay that ruling pending a petition for writ\n11 of mandamus.\n12                THE COURT:    No, I'm not staying that one.\n13 Not staying that one.\n14                MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n15                THE COURT:    All right.   Y'all take y'all's\n16 break and come about on the issue on the scheduling I\n17 guess that y'all were talking about.\n18                MR. GUERRA:    Tom, we'll talk outside,\n19 okay.\n20                MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n21                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you so much.\n22                THE COURT:    You can use the jury room if\n23 you want to or conference room or outside.\n24                (A break is taken.)\n25                THE COURT:    All right.   We're back on the\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0150\n\f                                                               43\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 record in Cause No. DC-14-07255.      This is on a motion to\n2 quash depositions, right?\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes.\n4                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Yes, Your Honor.\n5                 THE COURT:    All right.\n6                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Tom, I'm going to reiterate\n7 what we talked about.   Concerning the four depositions\n8 that Michelin noticed and we quashed Mr. Bullion and I\n9 discussed it and I will talk to Wendy Emmons,\n10 Mr. Blackerby's paralegal to coordinate dates to pair\n11 down the witnesses to a day or a day and a half, the ones\n12 in Dallas and then obviously the gentleman is in a\n13 different state, the trooper, and we will take that\n14 deposition.   We'll coordinate and work those dates out.\n15                MR. BULLION:   That sounds right.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:   Okay.   Concerning\n17 Mr. Wischhusen, Plaintiffs noticed that deposition.       That\n18 date is unavailable for Mr. Bullion.      Mr. Bullion's\n19 position is that -- I will let Mr. Bullion explain.\n20                MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, backing up just\n21 slightly.   Plaintiffs sent us letters asking for\n22 witnesses on 20 some odd topics and I've offered one\n23 witness in Dothan, Alabama, and I've offered three in\n24 Greenville.   And then after that they asked for\n25 depositions of six different Michelin employees by name\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0151\n\f                                                              44\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 and they happen to be the same people other than one.\n2 And what I've told them is I will put Michael Wischhusen\n3 up who is the subject of this motion to quash to address\n4 a couple of the topics in their letters which ultimately\n5 will get turned into deposition notices.     But I don't\n6 think it's fair for them to be able to notice him as an\n7 individual and as a representative of the company and he\n8 get to depose him for technically 12 hours.\n9                 So what I've said is when we get these\n10 deposition scheduled in Greenville, I will put\n11 Mr. Wischhusen up.   They apparently want to do it on a\n12 different trip, but I'm not agreeable to that just from a\n13 cost perspective; just make a special trip out there to\n14 depose Michael Wischhusen when they can depose him as a\n15 corporate rep on these topics maybe in a couple of hours.\n16 So that's my position on that.   I think it's something we\n17 ought to be able to work out.    And I certainly -- and\n18 again, I don't think these depositions can take place\n19 until we have an order from the court on that motion to\n20 compel so that we have the all of the documents out\n21 there.\n22                MR. GUERRA:   Your Honor, here is the issue\n23 Mr. Wischhusen -- first of all, we sent the letters about\n24 the topics separate and apart from this and Mr. Bullion\n25 refused to tell us or identify witnesses.    So he never\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                         MR 0152\n\f                                                               45\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 told us who the witnesses were.      He just said notice them\n2 and I will give you people and certain names, but he\n3 didn't give us names or the identity, never gave us.         We\n4 had the hearing October.\n5                   MR. SHAPIRO:   October 5.\n6                   MR. GUERRA:    And he left.   We found him at\n7 the airport and we ended up talking to him.        But\n8 meanwhile we had to send a letter out saying in addition\n9 to those guys we want to depose these specific people and\n10 Wischhusen was one of them.      If we wants to offer him in\n11 addition to cover some of the areas that's fine.        But I\n12 am going to ask him every question that I want about any\n13 topic that is relevant to this matter and that he knows\n14 about.   And that's what Mr. Bullion is trying to do.       Oh,\n15 no, he's only going to be offered on these two topics and\n16 nothing else.    No.   No.\n17                  Also he is telling us when we're going to\n18 conduct the depositions.     That's not the way it works.\n19 We tried to accommodate folk, we do.     We waited for two\n20 long hours for Mr. Blackerby in Dallas on the depositions\n21 on the records.    He was late.    We said no big deal buddy.\n22 You ordered the deposition on Mr. Vaneaton Price for a\n23 specific date.    After that hearing there was --\n24 (unintelligible) -- Mr. Bullion wrote a little ML that\n25 said, Hey, it's not good for me that day I have a\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0153\n\f                                                                46\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 commitment and we said anything for opposing counsel and\n2 we moved it two days back.       How long did that deposition\n3 take, two hours.     That was it.\n4                   We got to the point.   We asked the\n5 questions we are done.     We don't want to be told by\n6 Michelin how to conduct the discovery for our burden of\n7 proof.\n8                   Mr. Wischhusen is a very well known man\n9 with a lot of knowledge on that company.       He knows a lot\n10 about the company and a lot about the documents at issue\n11 here not just two topics.      That's our problem with the\n12 issue, Your Honor.\n13                  THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Bullion, tell\n14 me about that.\n15                  MR. BULLION:    I had a little bit of a hard\n16 time understanding some of that, Your Honor.\n17                  MR. GUERRA:    I'm sorry for my accent.\n18                  MR. BULLION:    But the thing is they have\n19 deposed Wischhusen before.      Mr. Guerra deposed him in\n20 that case -- and he's referring to Velo case out in\n21 Arizona.   I'm probably mispronouncing it so I apologize.\n22 He has deposed him before and he asked for him by name\n23 and I figure the Court is going probably going to let\n24 them depose Mr. Wischhusen.\n25                  All I'm asking is we're going have to\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0154\n\f                                                                47\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 spend a week in for Greenville these depositions.\n2 There's three other witnesses.       And I don't want to make\n3 a special trip out there for Michael Wischhusen if we can\n4 help it.    I would like to make as few trips out there as\n5 I can.\n6                   Just from a personal perspective, I've got\n7 a bunch of little kids and that are playing baseball.\n8 I've got all kind of stuff going on and I would like not\n9 to have to go out there one deposition at a time.      I\n10 would like to do it efficiently and at the least cost to\n11 my client and the Plaintiffs.\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    Like Mr. Bullion we have a\n13 small practice and it's just difficult for us to take a\n14 full week off.    So we'll, accommodate counsel but it's\n15 not going to be all in one trip.      It's not going to be\n16 all in the same time.   That's just not the way we work\n17 and I'm sorry about that.\n18                  THE COURT:    I'm not going to make you do\n19 that.   Y'all both have reasons why and you would\n20 certainly want to be efficient.      I don't see an inherent\n21 inefficiency if the person he's named Wischhusen or\n22 however you pronounce it.      They've named him as a person\n23 who has relevant knowledge of facts for this issue.       If\n24 Mr. Bullion Michelin wants to designate him also as a\n25 person with knowledge of relevant facts for the\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0155\n\f                                                              48\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 corporation, you certainly can do that and I'm going to\n2 say that Plaintiffs need to cover those areas too at the\n3 time.     If they want to take Mr. Wischhusen -- if you have\n4 give him notice that he is going to serve as a person\n5 with knowledge of relevant facts for Michelin on certain\n6 issues if you identify that then they need to cover that.\n7 And if they don't cover it then they didn't cover the\n8 person for Michelin that Michelin tendered regarding\n9 those areas that you designate Mr. Wischhusen's or\n10 whatever as the person who had knowledge of relevant\n11 facts.\n12                 MR. BULLION:   That's fair, Your Honor.    I\n13 told them the topics in their letters that he would\n14 address and that's fair.\n15                 THE COURT:   You get what I'm saying there?\n16                 MR. BULLION:   Yes, sir.\n17                 THE COURT:   Plaintiffs need to cover that\n18 with him.    I understand can you call anybody you want to\n19 as a named person.    But if Michelin and Mr. Bullion in\n20 trying to be efficient I think it's a good idea says,\n21 Hey, by the way we're also going to be identifying him as\n22 a corporate spokesperson a person with knowledge of\n23 relevant facts of the corporation on these areas.   You\n24 need to cover those areas too or when you get there\n25 you've passed that by.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0156\n\f                                                               49\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Yes, Your Honor.\n2                 THE COURT:    Y'all understand.\n3                 MR. BULLION:    I doubt it's going to be\n4 know issue, but, you know, they're entitled to six hours\n5 on whatever corporate rep we put up under the rules.       If\n6 we then put up 10 of them they get 60 hours.       But it sure\n7 seems like a lot to me.    I don't think they will take 12\n8 but --\n9                 THE COURT:    We won't be doing that.   But I\n10 don't know that we're going to get there until we do, but\n11 I get your point.   I appreciate the heads up.     Plaintiffs\n12 need to be observant of the fact that, you know, as you\n13 take these depositions of people of kind of dual capacity\n14 components, we're not going to have, you know, crazy\n15 number of hours racked up because of dual capacity.\n16 That's -- it's not likely to go that way.\n17                MR. BULLION:    Okay, Your Honor.   I just\n18 wanted to make that clear.\n19                THE COURT:    I appreciate the heads up on\n20 it because I see what you're saying.\n21                MR. BULLION:    I never had thought those\n22 rules were very fair frankly.    If you come up with\n23 infinite topics you can take infinite hours of\n24 depositions.   I have looked at it a number of times and I\n25 have not been able to figure out any argument to limit it\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0157\n\f                                                                50\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 so.\n2                 THE COURT:    You know it would be hard to\n3 argue that was the intent or purpose of the rules because\n4 the intent or purpose was to limit it and make it less\n5 costly.    So I get your point and I will be cognizant of\n6 that.\n7                 MR. BULLION:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n8                 THE COURT:    I caution both sides to keep\n9 that in mind.    Anything else?\n10                MR. GUERRA:    I have one small issue that I\n11 would like to ask Tom on the record.      We have had some\n12 documents produced that are not on its original format,\n13 specifically the document that I produced that are in\n14 black and white that in the original format that are in\n15 color and the color makes the difference because there\n16 are different colors in the document and those colors\n17 mean something concerning the color.\n18                THE COURT:    Well, produce the original\n19 format.\n20                MR. BULLION:    If we have color copies,\n21 we'll certainly produce them to you.\n22                THE COURT:    All right.   The Court is\n23 ordering it be produced in the original format.

(\"Michelin\") is a New York corporation\n\nthat conducts business in the State of Texas.\n\n        3.02 Michelin sells and distributes tires throughout Texas, and maintains its principal\n\nplace of business in South Carolina and which conducts business in Texas as authorized.\n\nMichelin may be served by serving its registered agent for service of process (CT Corporation\nSystem, 350 N. St. Paul Street, Dallas, Texas 75201).\n\n        3.03   Defendant Jose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars JOSE BUSTILLO d/b/a MUNDO\n\nCARS is a resident of the State of Texas who may be served with process at 6422 Day Street,\nDallas, Texas 75227.\n\n                             4.0        JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n       4.01    The amount in controversy is within the jurisdictional limits of this Court.\n\n       4.02    Venue is proper in Dallas County, Texas, pursuant to section 15.002(a) of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because Dallas County is the residence of Defendant\n\nJose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars and a portion of the events and omissions giving rise to the claim\n\noccurred in Dallas County.\n\n       4.03    Pursuant to § 13.005 of the Texas Civil Practices & Remedies Code, because\n\nvenue is proper as to Defendant Jose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars, venue is proper as to the other\n\nDefendant, Michelin No1th America, Inc., because the claims against such Defendants arise out\n\nof the same occmTence.\n\n                                  5.0   FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n       5.01    On or about September 3, 2012 at approximately 0451 hours, Adrian Rico,\n\nAdriana Rico, Maria Rico and Laura Rico, along with Plaintiffs Samuel Medina, Obdulia\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0162\n\fMedina and Natalye Medina, were traveling in a 2000 Ford Expedition southbound on Interstate\n55 near Exit 60 in Illinois.\n\n        5.02    Adrian Rico was the driver and owner of the Ford Expedition, and the remaining\nPlaintiffs were passengers and occupants.\n\n        5.03    At this time and place, Mr. Rico's operation of the 2000 Ford Expedition was\ncareful, lawful and prudent.\n\n        5.04    Suddenly and without warning and a result of Defendants' negligently, grossly\n\nnegligently and carelessly designed, tested, processed, assembled, fabricated, manufactured,\n\nlabeled, engineered, inspected, distributed, sold and warranted tire, the left rear tire on the Ford\n\nExpedition experienced a catastrophic failure directly and proximately causing the subject\n\nvehicle to, crash, flip, roll and/or ovetiurn on Interstate 55.\n\n        5.05    Each of the Plaintiffs in the vehicle at the time the subject Tire (the \"Tire\") failed\n\nsustained serious, permanent and/or catastrophic injuries.\n\n        5.06    The Tire failed as alleged due to the defendants negligence, gross negligence,\n\nrecklessness and/or carelessness in designing, testing, processing, assembling, fabricating,\n\nmanufacturing, labeling, engineering, inspecting, distributing, selling and/or warranting the Tire.\n\n        5.07    The official Illinois Traffic Crash Report states in pertinent part that the Ford\n\nExpedition \"[w]as traveling south on I-55, approximately .30 miles n01ih of exit 60, when the\n\ndriver's side rear tire blew out.\" The Crash Report also states that at the time of the incident, all\n\nof the occupants of the subject vehicle were wearing their safety seatbelt restraints.\n\n        5.08    The subject Tire that failed (the \"Tire\") was a Michelin LTX MIS P255 70R16\ntire (DOT B7LBEVUX3101) manufactured, designed, assembled, fabricated, labeled, inspected\n\nand distributed by Defendant Michelin.\n\n        5.09    Upon information and belief, the Tire was sold with the 2000 Ford Expedition by\n\nDefendant Jose Bustillo, d/b/a Mundo Cars in Dallas, Texas.\n\n        5.10    At the time the Tire failed, Plaintiffs were driving and traveling carefully and\n\nprudently, with the Tire being used for its ordinmy use and intended purpose.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0163\n\f        5.11    At and before the collision date of September 3, 2012, Defendant Michelin was\n\nengaged     in the business of designing, testing, processing,            assembling,    fabricating,\n\nmanufacturing, engineering, constrncting, distributing, labeling, inspecting, warranting and\n\nselling tires to the public, including the subject defective and dangerous Tire.\n\n        5.12    Michelin was responsible for the research, development, design, manufacture,\n\nlabeling, construction, assembly, testing, labeling, marketing, inspecting, warranting and sale of\nthe Tire.\n\n        5.13    The Tire was manufactured, assembled and constrncted at Michelin's Dothan,\nAlabama tire plant during the 31st week of 2001.\n\n        5.14    Prior to the date of the permanent, catastrophic and severe ittjuries sustained by\n\nPlaintiffs and at all times material hereto, Michelin placed the defective and ultra-hazardous Tire\ninto the stream of commerce.\n\n        5 .15   At the time of the aforementioned incident, the subject defective and ultra-\n\nhazardous Tire was being used as intended and in a manner foreseeable to Michelin, and as so\n\nforeseeably used was defective, unfit, unreasonably dangerous, failed to provide adequate\n\nwarnings, notices and instructions concerning its safety, use, maintenance, inspection,\n\nreplacement, expiration and repair.\n\n        5.16    The defective and unreasonably dangerous nature of Michelin's subject Tire\n\nrendered it unsafe for the use and purpose for which it was intended, and this dangerous and\n\ndefective condition was known or should have been known by Michelin.\n\n        5.17    The two most important components of a steel-belted radial tire including the\n\nsubject Tire are the two (2) steel belts layered on top of each other underneath the tread area.\n\n        5.18    One of the primary concerns in the manufacture of steel-belted radial tires is the\n\nadhesion between the two (2) steel belts, which must stick to each other and not move.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0164\n\f        5.19    Another primary concern in the manufacture of steel-belted radial tires is the.\n\nadhesion between the steel belts and the rubber, both on top the tread and on the bottom of the\n\ncarcass.\n\n        5.20    Michelin is aware that the rnbber and steel materials in its tires do not naturally\n\nadhere to each other. Therefore, the steel belts are coated with an adhesive rubber compound\n\ncalled skim stock.\n\n        5.21    Michelin knows that the edges of the radial tire's steel belts suffer the most\n\nstrain, heat and stress during operation and are susceptible to tread separation like what\n\nhappened to the subject Tire.\n\n        5.22   Michelin admitted in an official document submitted to NHTSA in 2006 under\n\nthe heading of \"Fundamental Mechanics of Belt Separation ... \" and under the subheading\n\n\"Basic Concepts\" of belt separation that \"Belt crack initiation and propagation\" sta1ts around\n\nthe ends of the cable. p.6-7.\n\n       5.23     This undeniable fact is also concluded by NHTSA in its white paper \"What\n\nApplied Research Has Learned From Indust1y About Tire Aging\" dated May I, 2003 which at\n\nSlide 4 reads \"Failures of Tires In the Field - Industry has told NHTSA that common tire failure\n\nmodes seen in the field are: Belt Edge Cracking,\"\n\n       5.24    Defendants defectively designed, tested, fabricated, manufactured, constructed,\n\nassembled, inspected, adve1tised, labeled, maintained, sold and/or distributed the subject Tire\n\nand placed it into the stream of commerce in an umeasonably dangerous condition.\n\n       5.25    The defects and lack ofreliability in the Tire were beyond the contemplation of a\n\nreasonable and foreseeable consumer because Michelin knew or should have known that\n\nultimate users, operators or consumers are not tire manufactures, tire technicians, or tire experts\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0165\n\fand merely members of the public whom would not and could not properly inspect this product\n\nfor defects and dangerous conditions, and that detection of such defects and dangers would be\n\nbeyond the capabilities of such persons or individuals.\n\n        5.26   Michelin negligently and recklessly caused the following non-exhaustive list of\n\ndeadly and hazardous defects to exist in the subject Tire: over-age rubber stock, liner pattern\n\nmarks, excessively thin inner-line, premature oxidation on the belt skim; improper splicing and\n\nspacing of belts and improper final inspection.\n\n        5.27   Michelin also carelessly and recklessly designed the subject Tire by failing to\n\nincorporate nylon overlays and a nylon cap ply, nylon belt edge layers, nylon safety belts to\n\nreduce the hazard of tread belt separation and catastrophic tire failure, as well as failing to\n\nincorporate adequate protection against air migration through the inner liner and tire aging.\n\n        5.28   Such inadequate quality control measures and inappropriate manufacturing and\n\ndesign practices and procedures promoted, allowed and failed to prevent separation of the Tire's\n\ninternal components and contributed to the tire failure and tread belt separation of the subject\n\nTire.\n\n        5.29   Michelin also is in possession of documents, testimony and information which\n\nconfirm that its manufacturing practices have included 1) building tires after they had trapped\n\nair or steam and had been exposed to inappropriate levels of moisture within the components of\n\nthe tire, 2) not promptly using pre-cured rubber and rubber-coated tire components to prevent\n\npremature oxidation from occurring within the tires' components so as to cause liner pattern\n\nmarks, 3) misplacement of the steel belts in the assembly which increases strain at the belt\n\nedges, promoting belt edge separation, 4) insufficient use of x-rays to detect improper and\n\ndefective manufacturing practices after the tires are built, 5) stacking of rubber components on\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0166\n\fthe unclean floor where those components were subject to contamination and 6) improper\n\nsplicing of the steel belts and innerliner of the tire which increases strain at the belt edges and\n\nthe tires' susceptibility to oxidative degradation and premature failure.\n\n         5.30   Michelin, knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that some of\n\nthe manufacturing defects found in the subject Tire are invisible to the naked eye and can only\n\nbe detected or identified with an x-ray.\n\n         5.31   Michelin knows that the older the age of the tire, the more likely it is to suffer\n\ntire failure.\n\n         5.32   Michelin knows that its steel belted radial tires such as the subject Tire 1) have a\n\ndate limit or expiration date of ten (10) years, 2) have a finite life and 3) suffer inevitable aging\n\nprocesses. Meanwhile, Michelin also knows that its consumers are not very experienced with\n\ntires.\n\n         5.33   Michelin is aware of the risk to its company posed by 10 year-old tires is very\n\nsmall because there are only a very small percentage of these very old tires on the road.\n\n         5.34   Michelin privately and publicly opposes tire age legislation such as laws\n\nrequiring expiration dates on tires because it would \"create supply chain issues ... Larger\n\ncustomers may well expect a stock buy-back for tires they can't sell before the age deadline\n\nlapses.\"\n\n         5.35   Michelin's tire verification depaiiment at its Dothan, AL plant follows work\n\ninstructions titled \"General Principles\" during the inspection of its finished tires. According to\n\nMichelin's own General Principles, tires that are rejected by the tire inspectors and not up to the\n\nstandards of Michelin's vehicle manufacturer customers such as GM or Ford are downgraded\n\nand sold to the replacement market as new replacement Michelin tires. However, Michelin's\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0167\n\fconsumers and even the dealers who purchase replacement tires have no idea that the tires they\n\nare purchasing were downgraded and rejected by Michelin's automotive customers.\n\n        5.36   Michelin purports that its Dothan tire plant is ISO QS 9000 certified and\n\ncompliant but Michelin does not comply with ISO QS 9000 requirements and quality standards.\n\n        5.37   Because of Michelin's poor manufacturing practices, the Tire at issue fails to\n\nmeet standards, which Michelin itself recognized as necessary tlu·ough its own internal\n\nstandards concerning tire-building practices.\n\n        5.38   Michelin has a Bad Habits List of manufacturing issues which sets forth some of\n\nthese internal standards.\n\n        5.39   In addition, Michelin has Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents,\n\nwhich set fotih Michelin's own internal standards concerning tire building and tire\n\nmanufacturing of its tires.\n\n        5.40   Michelin's Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents have annexes,\n\nglossaries, illustrations, photographs, and attachment with additional information and caveats\n\npertaining to such standards.\n\n       5.41    Michelin's Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents and their annexes\n\nset forth numerous standards, which tire inspectors must check when inspecting cured tires.\n\n       5.42    Michelin also has a Product Standards and Guidelines Manual for Required Tire\n\nDimensional Tolerances, work procedures, reaction limits, product tolerance limits training\n\nmaterials and videotapes and tests for the tire builders - all of which set forth internal standards\n\nwhich Michelin is required to follow in the assembly, manufacturing and making of its tires.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0168\n\f        5.43    In connection with Michelin's design, manufacturing and warranty practices,\n\nMichelin performs Failure Modes and Effects Analysis and tire endurance tests, which address\n\nfailure modes of its tires.\n\n        5.44    Michelin also maintains and analyzes warranty return adjustment data with\n\ngraphs to chatt and compare tire models against other tire models and tire plants against other\n\ntire plants.\n\n        5.45    Michelin has a tire adjustment claims procedure and replacement policy\n\nadministration guidelines to maintain its knowledge of the link between its manufacturing\n\npractices and designs and tire tread separations.\n\n        5.46    Michelin's own internal confidential data about the LTX MIS tire line returns\n\nreveal that more than 700 (just from one of its hundreds of dealers and the largest tire retailer in\n\nthe world - Discount Tire) of its defective LTX MIS tires were returned for belt edge\n\nseparations. In addition, over 1,000 tires were returned to Michelin's dealers for ride vibration\n\n- an admitted precursor to tread belt separation.\n\n        5 .47   This staggering number of many more than 1,500 defective tires demonstrates,\n\ndocuments and proves that Michelin knew - as early as 2001 (11 years before the incident) -\n\nthat its LTX MIS tire line was dangerously defective.\n\n        5 .48   Instead of investigating this epidemic of defects, discovering the cause of the\n\nexcessive number of tread separations and correcting it, Michelin did the exact opposite and\n\nconcealed and still conceals this information from the public and its consumers that its LTX line\n\nposed and poses unreasonable risks of deadly danger to its consumers.\n\n        5 .49   Therefore, Michelin has direct knowledge of the link between its improper and\n\ninadequate tire design and manufacturing practices and procedures and tire tread separations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0169\n\f        5.50    Michelin also is in possession testimony and information, which confirms that\n\nthe individuals responsible for inputting, monitoring, reviewing and analyzing the adjustment\n\ndata were careless and never bothered to look at the staggering number of returns made to\n\nDiscount Tire for tread belt edge separation.\n\n        5.51    The subject Tire was defectively designed and the risks of the chosen design of\n\nthe tire outweighed the utility of the chosen designs, because known safer alternative designs\n\nwere technologically and economically feasible and were used by Michelin in other tires made\n\nfor foreign markets while not used in the U.S. market.\n\n        5.52    Safer alternative designs for the tire at issue also include the use of a belt skim\n\nrubber compound more resistant to heat and less susceptible to degrading from ozone and other\n\nfactors, which Defendants knew through its own research would cause premature degradation of\n\nthe chemicals in its tires.\n\n        5.53    Safer alternative designs for the subject Tire also include a thicker gauged belt\n\nskim rubber and inner liner, effective use of nylon reinforcement of one or both steel belts (such\n\nreinforcement could have been implemented as a full-width cap ply, a spirally wound strip, or\n\ntwo strips of sufficient width to reinforce to belt package at the steel belt edges).\n\n        5.54    Through its access to the underlying patents and other research regarding tire\n\ndesign and manufacturing including but not limited to J.Boileau/Michelin, U.S. Patent\n\n3,717,190, February 20, 1973 and A.L.

These\n\ntires suffered from defective premature oxidation like the subject Tire that caused or contributed\n\nto their failures and were aged when they failed like the subject Tire, which caused or\n\ncontributed to their failures. Many of these tires evidenced liner pattern marks like the subject\n\nTire, indicative of poor adhesion that similarly caused or contributed to their failures. Many of\n\nthese tires contained belt irregularities such as improper splicing and spacing which existed in\n\nthe subject Tire that caused or contributed to their failures.

In addition to each of these damages, the Medina\n\nfamily also seeks prejudgment and post-judgment interest as well as all compensable court costs.\n\n           8.03   That Defendants' egregious and willful conduct constitutes serious and\n\nconscious disregard for the life and limb of Plaintiffs in that the Defendants knew or should\n\n\n                                                  21\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0181\n\fhave known of that their tires were not reasonably safe, contained manufacturing and design\n\ndefects, and would not adequately, reasonably and safely protect the public, end-users,\n\nconsumers, motorists, occupants and passengers such as Plaintiffs from serious injuries.\n\nDefendants' egregious and willful conduct in failing to warn Plaintiffs of said tire design,\n\nmanufacturing, tire aging including but not limited to that tires have a date limit and other\n\ndangerous conditions further constitutes serious and conscious disregard for the life and limb of\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n        Additionally, Defendants acted to serve their own interests, having reason to know yet\n\nconsciously disregarding the consequential injuries to Plaintiffs by placing the subject Tire in\n\nthe stream of commerce and selling it to the public. Fmiher, Defendants consciously pursued a\n\ncourse of conduct knowing that it created a substantial risk of significant harm to Plaintiffs.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to and demand exemplary and punitive damages against\n\nDefendants, and each of them, in a sum that is reasonable and just in the premises.\n\n        8.04   That futihermore, upon information and belief, the outrageous misconduct of\n\nDefendants, and each of them, was committed with an \"evil mind\" and constituted a serious and\n\nwillful disregard for the safety and welfare of Plaintiffs and of the deceased. The events herein\n\narose from Defendants' callous disregard for the safety and welfare of Plaintiffs, in that\n\nDefendants, and each of them, knew full well of the consequences of their unlawful and reckless\n\nacts. Further, Defendants, and each of them, acted to serve their own interests, having reason to\n\nknow and consciously disregarding the substantial risk that their conduct might significantly\n\ncause serious i1tjury and/or damages.

Michelin's conduct was such that when viewed objectively from the standpoint of\n\nthe actor at the time of its occurrence, Michelin was aware that its conduct involved an extreme\n\ndegree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the potential harm to others.\n\nFurther, Michelin had actual, subjective awareness of the risk involved, but neve1iheless\n\nproceeded with conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.

(“MNA”), one of the defendants in the\n\nabove-styled and numbered cause, and files this its Special Exceptions, Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs’ Original Petition, and Reliance Upon Jury Demand, and shows the Court as follows:\n\nA.     Special Exceptions\n\n       1.     MNA specially excepts to Paragraph 6.0 in Plaintiffs’ Original Petition and\n\nrespectfully asks that plaintiffs be required to replead to specify the managing agent at MNA\n\nwho committed the alleged malice or gross negligence and specifically what acts he or she\n\ncommitted.\n\n       2.     MNA also specially excepts to Paragraph 8 in Plaintiffs’ Original Petition where\n\nplaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts. Pursuant to Rule 47 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, plaintiffs should be required to replead to specify the range of damages sought and\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0194\n\fshould not be allowed to conduct discovery until this failure is corrected. Plaintiffs should\n\nadditionally be required to state the maximum amount of damages sought.\n\n          3.    MNA requests that these Special Exceptions be granted and that the offending\n\nallegations be stricken or that plaintiffs be given an appropriate but limited period of time within\n\nwhich to replead. If plaintiffs do not timely replead, MNA requests that the allegations in\n\nquestion be stricken.\n\nB.        General Denial\n\n          MNA invokes the provisions of Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and\n\nexercises its legal right to require plaintiffs to prove all of the allegations contained in their\n\npleadings, if plaintiffs can so prove them, which is denied. Accordingly, MNA denies generally\n\nthe allegations in plaintiffs’ pleadings and demands strict proof thereof by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\nC.        Affirmative Defenses\n\n          1.    MNA alleges that the tire in question met or exceeded all applicable government\n\nstandards. As such, MNA is entitled to a presumption that it is not liable under a theory of strict\n\nproducts liability.\n\n          2.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ alleged damages were proximately caused by or, in\n\nthe alternative, were solely proximately caused by the acts, omissions, or fault of Adrian Rico,\n\nthe driver of the vehicle in question.   The acts and/or omissions of Adrian Rico amounting to\n\nnegligence include losing control of the vehicle in question and causing the accident in question.\n\nThe investigating officer’s crash report notes that Adrian Rico’s “failing to reduce speed to avoid\n\ncrash” was a contributory cause of the crash. In addition, Adrian Rico was driving without\n\nadequate sleep and failed to properly steer the vehicle following the failure of the tire. MNA\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          2\n                                                                                               MR 0195\n\falleges that Adrian Rico was negligent in his operation of the accident vehicle and that said\n\nnegligence was a proximate cause of the accident. In addition, Adrian Rico and Maria Rico were\n\nnegligent in their maintenance of the tire in question. Specifically, they never had the vehicle or\n\ntires inspected prior to the accident and only checked the air pressure in the tire in question once\n\nduring the time they owned the vehicle. The tire was more than 10 years old at the time of the\n\naccident, which is contrary to the service life recommendation of MNA and other tire\n\nmanufacturers. The tire failed because of a history of overdeflection, which weakened the tire,\n\nand damage suffered due to a prior impact.           Evidence of overdeflection includes rim line\n\ncompression grooves and balance weight clip marks. Evidence of prior impact includes a radial\n\nsplit, bare and broken polyester cords, broken steel cords and accelerated tread wear. MNA\n\nalleges that Adrian Rico and Maria Rico were negligent in their maintenance of the tire and that\n\nsaid negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. MNA alleges that Adrian Rico and Maria\n\nRico are responsible third parties as those terms are defined and used in sections 33.003, 33.004\n\nand 33.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n          3.   MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for damages may be barred in whole or in\n\npart, whether under the doctrine of comparative responsibility or failure to mitigate damages, by\n\nthe failure of plaintiffs to utilize available and functional safety restraint devices as required by\n\nIllinois law. The same constitutes negligence per se and MNA requests that the jury be so\n\ninstructed.\n\n          4.   MNA alleges in the alternative that plaintiffs’ alleged damages were proximately\n\ncaused by, or, in the alternative, were solely proximately caused by, the acts, omissions, or fault\n\nof third parties for whose conduct MNA is not in any way liable or responsible.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          3\n                                                                                                MR 0196\n\f          5.    MNA specifically pleads the provisions of Chapters 32 and 33 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code dealing with contribution and comparative responsibility and\n\nrequests that any damages be assessed in accordance with those provisions. Plaintiffs have sued\n\nJose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars and alleged that his negligence was a proximate cause of the\n\naccident. MNA alleges he was negligent because he sold a vehicle with 5 different tires of 4\n\ndifferent sizes including the subject tire that was over 10 years old. MNA alleges that Jose\n\nBustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars is a co-defendant or, if the claims against him are subsequently\n\ndismissed, a responsible third party or settling party as those terms are defined and used in\n\nsections 33.003, 33.004 and 33.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n          6.    MNA specifically pleads Chapter 82 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies\n\nCode dealing with design defects and requires plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof with regard\n\nto all claims of design defect as specified in Chapter 82.            Plaintiffs must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence (1) there was a “safer alternative design,” as that term is\n\nstatutorily defined, and (2) the defect was a producing cause of the personal injury, property\n\ndamage, or death for which the claimant seeks recovery.           MNA requests that the jury be\n\ninstructed on all statutorily required elements of a “design defect case.”\n\n          7.    MNA asserts that plaintiffs’ recovery of medical or health care expenses incurred\n\nbe limited to the amount actually paid or incurred by or on behalf of the plaintiffs. Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 41.0105.\n\n          8.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for breach of warranty are barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations, having been asserted more than four years after original delivery\n\nof the subject tire.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          4\n                                                                                               MR 0197\n\f          9.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for breach of warranty are barred on account\n\nof plaintiffs’ failure to give notice as required by Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 2.607.\n\n          10.   MNA alleges that by virtue of the 1995 amendments to the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices – Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.41, et seq., recovery\n\nunder the DTPA is limited to “economic damages” as defined by statute. Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode § 17.45(11). “Economic damages” are statutorily limited to pecuniary loss. By statute,\n\nplaintiffs may not recover exemplary damages, damages for physical pain and mental anguish,\n\nlost of consortium, disfigurement, physical impairment, or loss of companionship and society.\n\nFurthermore, “mental anguish” damages may not be awarded unless the trier of fact finds that\n\nMNA’s conduct was committed intentionally. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(b)(1).\n\n          11.   With respect to plaintiffs’ allegation of punitive or exemplary damages, MNA\n\nalleges as follows:\n\n                a.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n                be sustained because an award of punitive damages in this case would contravene\n\n                and violate Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the\n\n                United States, which guarantees due process of law and equal protection of the\n\n                laws; Article 1, Section 3 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal\n\n                protection of the law; and Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which\n\n                guarantees due process. Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages are\n\n                unconstitutional in the following respects:\n\n                b.      Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA\n\n                cannot be sustained because the standard for determining liability for punitive\n\n                damages under Texas law is vague and arbitrary and does not define with\n\n\n\n4542675                                          5\n                                                                                            MR 0198\n\f          sufficient clarity the conduct or mental state which gives rise to such a claim and\n\n          therefore violates MNA’s constitutional due process rights under the Fourteenth\n\n          Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 19 of the\n\n          Texas Constitution.\n\n          c.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages cannot be sustained\n\n          against MNA in this case because Texas law does not (i) provide a standard of\n\n          sufficient clarity for determining the appropriateness, or the appropriate size, of a\n\n          punitive damages award, (ii) provide limits on punitive damages imposed by the\n\n          applicable principles of deterrence and punishment, (iii) prohibit an award of\n\n          punitive damages, in whole or in part, on the basis of invidiously discriminatory\n\n          characteristics, including the corporate status of defendants, and (iv) provide for\n\n          judicial review on the basis of objective standards in violation of defendants’ due\n\n          process and equal protection rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\n          the United States Constitution and the double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth\n\n          Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and by Article 1,\n\n          Section 3 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of the law;\n\n          and Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees due process,\n\n          and Article 1, Section 14 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees against\n\n          double jeopardy.\n\n          d.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained in this case because any award of punitive damages under Texas law\n\n          without bifurcating the trial of all punitive damages issues and the failure of the\n\n          Court to adopt other procedural constitutional safeguards in the submission of\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                     6\n                                                                                          MR 0199\n\f          evidence relative to determining the size of any punitive damages award would\n\n          violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which\n\n          guarantees due process of law and equal protection of laws; Article I, Section 3 of\n\n          the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of the laws; and Article\n\n          I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees due process of law.\n\n          e.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained in this case because imposition of a punitive damages award would\n\n          violate the due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the\n\n          Texas Constitution because the standard for the imposition of punitive damages\n\n          lacks objective guidelines, invites the jury to engage in caprice and discrimination\n\n          in the administration of the law and permits repeated and unlimited punishment\n\n          for the same alleged misconduct.\n\n          f.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained because an award of punitive damages under the Texas law for the\n\n          purposes of compensating plaintiffs for elements of damage not otherwise\n\n          recognized by Texas law would violate MNA’s due process rights guaranteed by\n\n          the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by the due\n\n          process provisions of Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n          g.     Any award of punitive damages based on anything other than MNA’s\n\n          conduct in connection with the sale of the specific single tire that is the subject of\n\n          this lawsuit would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\n          the United States Constitution and the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth\n\n          Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                      7\n                                                                                           MR 0200\n\f                 clause of Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and Article I, Section 14\n\n                 of the Texas Constitution providing guaranty against double jeopardy, because\n\n                 any other judgment for punitive damages in this case cannot protect defendants\n\n                 against impermissible multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong.\n\n                 h.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n                 be sustained because any judgment for punitive damages in this case would\n\n                 constitute multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong and cannot protect\n\n                 defendants against multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong in future\n\n                 cases in violation of MNA’s rights to due process and equal protection of the laws\n\n                 under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\n                 Section 3 and 19 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n                 i.     Alternatively, in the event the Court allows the jury to consider awarding\n\n                 punitive damages despite the constitutional defects described above, MNA\n\n                 asserts that the cap on exemplary damages contained in Chapter 41 of the Texas\n\n                 Civil Practice & Remedies Code applies and limits the amount of exemplary\n\n                 damages which can be awarded.\n\nD.        Reliance Upon Jury Demand\n\n          MNA relies upon plaintiffs’ jury demand.\n\n          WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, defendant Michelin North America, Inc.\n\nprays that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, that MNA have judgment for its costs in this\n\nproceeding, and that the Court grant MNA such other and further relief as the Court may deem\n\njust and proper.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                           8\n                                                                                               MR 0201\n\f                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                           GERMER BEAMAN & BROWN, P.L.L.C.\n                                           301 Congress Avenue, Suite 1700\n                                           Austin, Texas 78701\n                                           (512) 472-0288 Telephone\n                                           (512) 472-0721 Facsimile\n\n                                           By: /s/ Thomas M.

When it stops, tragedy: Obdulia, the Medina n101n, had become a\n\nquadriplegic.\n\n       Thus, this lawsuit is a products liability and negligence case arising out of the\n\ncatastrophic failure of that defective Mcl1elin I/l'X M/S tire on Septe1nbcr 3, 2012 which caused\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0206\n\fthe quadriplegia of Plaintiff Obdulia Medina and a myriad of injuries to the other occupants.\n\nJust lil(e it has done to many otl1cr fmnilics including the Velo fan1ily, Michelin's defectively\n\ndesigned and manufactured T,cfX :MIS tire line just added another victhn to its long list and\n\nPlaintiffs can prove it with Michelin's own documents. 'fhat is why Michelin refuses to produce\n\nthe critical info1mation, documents and evidence repeatedly requested since April. All of it\n\nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of ad1nissible evidence in accordance with the\n\n'J'cxas Rules of C:ivil Procedure.\n\nII.     Background: 'fhis Motion simply requests the ITonorable Court to order Defendant\n\nMicl1elin to comply with the \"fexas discovery rules and produce the critical documents,\n\ninformation and evidence repeatedly asked for more than four (4) monihs since the beginning of\n\nApril 2015.     Requests for Production, r;xhibit A. At the end of April, Michelin produced next\n\nto nothing. Defendant's Responses, Exhibit B. On May 11, 2015, after the hearing, in a meetit1g\n\njust outside this courtrootn, and ihcreaftcr, defense counsel repeatedly promised that if Plaintiffs\n\njust signe(f Michelin's Protective Order, they would get the re1nainh1g documents:\n\n                Your email is co1rcct that MNA anticipates being able to make its\n                supplemental production within 10-14 days of the protective order\n                being entered,\n\nE-lvfail fron1 Nelson Mullins, counsel for NfNA, May 28, 2015, r<,Xhfbit (~.\n\n                [W}c will rr1ovc forward with the agreed protective order and \\Vith our\n                supplemental production, which we would anticipate making\n                within 10-14 days of entrr of the protective order.\n\nJi:-Mail fro1n Nelson Mulli11s, counsel for MNA, Mlty 29, 2015, Exhibit D.\n\n                We are worl{ing on the production anti still anticipate mal<lng it\n                within 10-14 days of entry of the protective order as originally\n                estimated.\n\nr~·-.MaiL fron11Velson   M11lli11s, counsel for .MlYA, June 4, 20.15, Exhibit E'.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0207\n\f        Though Plaintiffs disagree witl1 Protective ()rders, in view of Michelin's repeated\n\npromises, Plaintiff.'> executed it All a sham. Michelin's production at the end o.f'June was a\n\njoke. It failed to produce about fo1iy (40) of the fifty (50) requests for production. Despite\n\ncountless e-mails, co1Tespondcnce and phone calls by Plaintiff<;' counsel concerning Michelin's\n\nproduction of docun1cnts about the design, inspection, testing, building, curing, quality control\n\nprocesses, 1nanufacture and retu111s concerning Micl1elin LTX M/S tires, it is clear that Michelin\n\nhas 1nisled Plaintiffs about its production every step of the way.\n\n        So, 011 ,July 16, 2015, Plaintiffs informed Michclh1 that their production was cxh·emcly\n\ndeficient mid that they would seek ::;anctions fi·om the Cou1i. In response Michelin did nothing.\n\n'fhcy never tried to teach J>laintiffs' counsel by phone,   e~mail   or letter. So, on August 3, 2015,\n\nPlaintiffs sent another letter. Still nothing. 'fhe next day, on August 4, 2015, Plaintiff<>' counsel\n\n£)avid Shapiro directly contacted defense counsel about the deficient disclo::;ure and was\n\ninfo1med that tl1c atto1ney in chm·gc of Michelin's discovery was no 1011ger working 011 the case.\n\nMr. Shapiro did not give up. So, he contacted other Michelin counsel. Still, Michelin offered no\n\nadditional production and Mr. Shapiro was told that the production o-f documents had to be\n\nnegotiated v.,1ith Michelin. Yet, again, Plaintiff.<>' counsel wrote to Michelin's counsel. Still, 110\n\nadditional production. Instead, Michelin played du1nb, wasted time and acted like it did not\n\nknow that their production wa::; grossly deficient. Refush1g to give up, the next day, August 5,\n\n2015, Plaintiffs' counsel Luis Guen·a called and also wrote to Michelin's counsel about its\n\ndeficient disclosure.   (;orrespondence, Exhibit F          In response, Plaintiff.\"' counsel got no\n\ndocu1nents and was told that Plaintiffs needed to negotiate the discovery with Michelin. Still,\n\njust four (4) days ago on August 17, 2015, during the depositions of the driver and his family,\n\nPJah1tiffs' counsel again discussed this issue with defe11sc counsel in Dallas, 'I'exas. In response,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0208\n\fPlaintiffs' counsel was again told that they should know the process by now having done it in\n\nVelo and that they needed to 11egotiate the production Vvith Michelin.\n\n        ln short, after waiting nearly five (5) months and even executing Michelin's Protective\n\nOrder, Michelin responded to about ten (10) of Plaintiffs' fifty (50) Requests for Production.\n\nThousands of pages of relevant documents inte11tionally concealetl and withheld by Michelin to\n\nprevent Plaintiff.<> from exposing their shoddy practices and known defects tl1at led to this L'fX\n\nMIS failure. Therefore, this Motio11 simply requests the flonorable Court to order J)efcndanl\n\nMichelin to comply with the Texas discovery rules and prod11ce the critical docun1ents,\n\ninfo11nation and evidence repeatedly asked for 1norc than fOur (4) months since the beginning of\n\nApril 2015.\n\n111.    Michelin's 'Discovery Modus ()perandi: The subject defective Michelin tire itself and\n\nt11c docu1ncn1.s requested together with a plant inspection arc critical evidence in this case.\n\nMichelin knows the critical importance of the docu1nents and how they are interrelated to each\n\nother. Plaintiffs' counsel knows the docu1nents because a couple of years ago they had a case\n\nsimilar to t11is one na1ncd Velo. Similar to Velo, the passengers of this vehicle were severely\n\ninjured, 5Jinn?ar to Velo, a scat-belted morn bccan1e a quad1iplegic, paraly7.cd fi:om the neck\n\ndown. ,')imilar to Velo, this case involves a rollover caused by a defective Michcli11 tire corning\n\napart on the highway. c'limilar to Velo, the defective Michelin tire is a light truck tire. Sin1ilar to\n\nVelo, the defective Michelin light tn1ck tire is a I.,TX ivf/S.      /{iniilar to Velo, the defective\n\nMichelin LTX MIS was nlanufactured at Michelin's plant in Dothan, Alabama. Similar to Velo,\n\ntbc defCctive Michelin LTX M/S tire was manufactured in the year of2001. c'limilar to Velo, the\n\ndefective Michelin l,'l'X M/S tii·e had a significat1l an1ount ofuscablc and legal tread. 1bc cases\n\narc so similar that in the present case Michelin demanded to use the exact same Protective Order\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n                                                                                                    MR 0209\n\fas the one used in Velo. Similar to Velo, one of Michelin's law .firms handling the discovery is\n\nNelson Mullins.       So, because of Velo PlaintiffS' counsel lmows that each of the documents\n\nrequested is critical in this case.\n\n         l.JnfOrtunately, just like the Tle/o case aJJd a myriad of other 1\\.1ichelin cases, stonewalling\n\nis Michelin's strategy ru1d discovery practice. First, Michelin makes up its own                     sclf~serving\n\n\nscope of discovery and disregards the applicable Rules of Discovery. Second, Michelin claims it\n\ndid nothing Mong, denies liability and discloses nothing. Third, 1\\.1ichelin pro1nises to produce\n\ndocun1ents after it tricks the Plaintiffs into signing a Protective Order.                  Fourth, even after\n\nexecuting a l)rotective Order, Michelin still produces next to nothing, Fifth, Michelin alleges\n\nthat procedural technicalities such as meet m1d confer 1 has not been 1net to further delay\n\nproduction. Sixth, J.>Iaintiffs are forced to file motions to compel. This is not argument. This is\n\na fact. 1''here are multiple examples of Micl1elin's illegal course of conduct in Courts across the\n\ncountry, (Plaintiffs will search and obtain the best example they can and will provide it to the\n\nCourt prior to the hearing on this motion).\n\n        This way the all mighty Michelin misdirects the lawsuit from its merits and forces the\n\ndisabled quadriplegic Plaintiff to waste their limited resources in time consuming and expensive\n\ndiscovery disputes.       As a result, the Plaintiffs gain nothing and waste precious time and\n\nresources. Just plain Mong. 'J'herefore, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this 1-Ionorable Court to deal\n\nswiftly with Michelin's illegal conduct and order it to co1nply with the Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nand produce the long overdue requested discovery immediately or face severe sanctions.\n\nIV.     Michelin's stonewalling: At the inception of this products liability lawsuit, Plaintiffs\n\nserved Michelin with discovery requests asking for products liability documentation concerning\n\n\n1\n True to form a few days ago on August 13, 2015, Michelin's counsel wrote a letter threatening that meet and\nconfer requirements were not complied with. Defense counsel corresponde11ce, August 13, 2015, Exhibit(}.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0210\n\ftheir LTX M/S tire.

Jn addition, Michelin failed to produce its belt skhn\nstock formula pe1taining to the subject tire. The rubber used between the steel belts is referred to as skim stock.\nSkim stock is what iuakcs the belts adhere to one another. 'fherefore, the design ofthe skim stock and its resfatance\nto degradation is critical evidence to understand the subject tire's resistance to tread belt separation failure like it\nhappened here.\n\n\n\n                                                                    6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                MR 0211\n\f                                                                   ...             .\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)csign & Manufacture           'No\n\n\n                                                                   410312015           J)csign & Manufacture               No\n\n\n\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)esign & Manufacture               No\n\n\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)csign & Manufacture               No4\n\n                                                                                                                       i\n                                                                   4/03/2015           Design & Manufacture\n\n                                                                                                                       f\n                                                                                                                       I\n                                                                                                                                 I\n                                                                                                                                 I\n                                                                                                                                 '\n                    North      America's                           4/03/2015           Design & Manufacture                No    I\n        recommendations,       dete11ninations,     or\n        guidelines as to the acceptable or\n        unacceptable rate or :fi·equeney of loss\n        adjustment (how the tire is doing in the\n        Geld)\n    16.

Prejudice to Jlfaintiffs\n\n         Michelin's actions are extremely prejudicial to Plaintiffs preventing them from\n\nconducting products liability discovery in this case.      !<~or   instance, Plaintiffs cannot conduct\n\ndiscovery or depose Michelin's witnesses and employees about 1) manufacturing and/or design\n\ndefects, 2) the ma11ufacturing and design .Process, 3) the Aspect Specifications, 4) the General\n\nPrh1ciples, 5) the 'Technical Notes, 6) Quality Control, 7) Classification of tires, 8) Repair\n\nprocedures, 9) the L1'X MIS reac,ied tolerance limits, 10) manufUctul'ing and design of the LTX\n\nMIS, 11) the wa1ranty clairns on the LTX MIS, 12) problems occu1Ting d11riI1g 1nanufilcturing,\n\n13) the tire inspection process and damage ru1alyses, etc., etc., etc. Without tl1ese docmnents,\n\nMichelin prevents: a) Plaintiffs fro1n conductir1g product;; liability discovery, b) prevent\n\nPlaintiff.~'   experts from obtaining tl1e necessary foundation, and c) further prevents Plaintiffs\n\nfrom cross-examining Michelin's expe1ts. Even worse, Michelin will attempt to be rewarded\n\nfor its absconsio11 of evidence by filing Motions :for Summary Judginent, Daubert Motions and\n\nMotions to Exclude Plaintiffs' liability cxpe1t - claiming that they did not have reliable data\n\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\n\n                                                                                                    MR 0224\n\finf(nmation or evidence supporting their opinions. Thus, Michelin's stonewalling is extremely\n\nprejudicial to l)laintiffs.\n\n        Michelin's delays are even more egregious when one considers the spastic quadriplegic\n\nObdulia. It is easy to forget and lo;;e sight of the real Plaintiffs including Obdulia whose life\n\nwas destroyed by Michelin's defective tire.         Now, they add insult to injury, preventing\n\ndiscovery and withholding relevant evidence. All this to prevent Obdulia and her family fi:om\n\nhaving their day in Court. ()bdulia has no time to waste. Iler life as a result of the defective\n\nMichelin's tire failure is unbearable. She cannot walk. She cannot 1nove. She cannot even\n\nturn herself around in bed. She cannot cut her ovvn fOod. She cannot even open her pill box\n\nwith her hm1ds to take her strict daily prescription regimen. She cannot urinate or evacuate like\n\na 11011nal human being. Her husband and children have to excavate fCces out of her rectu1n.\n\nShe cannot perform the most basic hu1nan functions. She repeatedly contracts deadly bed\n\nsores, and urinary tract infections which require fi·cquent hospitalizations - all of which a direct\n\nresult of Michelin's defective tire f3.ilure.\n\n        (~onclusion:          Michelin   intentionally withheld   and concealed       the Aspect\n\nSpecifications and all corresponding documents.           Michelin intentionally withheld and\n\nconcealed the General Principles.          Michelin intentionally withheld and concealed the\n\nTechnical Notes and related documents. Similarly, Michelin intentionally withheld and\n\nconcealed all the Reaction and Tolerance Limits documents.                ln addition, Michelin\n\n\\Vithhcld and concealed the adjustment data and thousand.11 of warranty claims as well as\n\nall the internal documents it uses to identify, adjust and evaluate the returned defective\n\ntires after they leave the plant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0225\n\f          Conversely,     Plaintiff.~   have diligently assisted Michelin in their discovery by: 1)\n\nshipping the detCctive tire to Michelin for their forty-Jive (45) day inspection, 2) 1naking the\n\nvehicle available fOr inspection to Michelin's cxpe1is, 3) producing Plaintiff.\"! and fmnily for\n\ndepositions, and 4) assisting in the depositions of the driver and family.                        In all, nine (9)\n\ndepositions that J>laintiffs made possible and available to Michelin.                      Plaintiffs have given\n\nMichelin access to all they needed to conduct their discovery and further their defenses,\n\n          The facts speak for themselves. Michelin k11ows the importance of the documents\n\nrequested and how critical the info1mation is. So, Michelin made a conscious and intentional\n\ndecision to withhold and conceal them. ·rhls is Michelin's modus· 011erandi. J)efiant, an·ogant,\n\nand in disregard of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. When M'ichelin is sued, Michelin acts\n\nlike they have their own special rules of civil procedure m1d: 1) discloses nothing, 2) delays\n\nalways, and 3) prevents justice. Michelin's conduct directly violates the 'I'exas discovery ii.des,\n\nthe fundamental principles of litigation, and the authority of this Honorable Court. Michelin's\n\nactions co1Tupt the i11tegrily of the legal process and make a mockery of the l'exas justice\n\nsystem.\n\n          This cannot be tolerated. T11is is not how litigation is done in t11e -Lone Star State. 'fhe\n\ntortfeasor docs not control the litigation proccs;; and usurps fron1 the Great State of Texas its\n\nexclusive power to dcte1111inc the llules of Civil Procedure and its prescribed scope of\n\ndi;;covcry.     Moreover, \\Vith a fa;;t approaching expert disclosure deadline, tiinc i;; of the\n\nessence. Accordingly, pursuant to 1'ex. R.              C~iv.   P. 215.2, PlaintiffS respectfully request this\n\nflonorable c:ourt 15 to order J)efendant Michelin to iinmediatcly produce the requested\n\ninforn1ation and documc11ts and \"make such orders ... as m·e just.\"\n\n                ---~---\n\n\n15\n  1''he choice of authorized sanctions is within the sound discretion of the trial court In re F,sfate ofMarley, 390\n8.W.3d 421, 424 (Tex.

I believe our position on the protective order is very clear-that we cannot agree to your\nadded language, which would render the protective order meaningless and would expose Michelin's trade secrets to\npublic disclosure. If you will agree to remove that language, we will move forward with the agreed protective order and\nwith our supplemental production, which we would anticipate making within 10-14 days of entry of the protective\norder. !fyou will not agree to remove the language, please let me know as soon as possible so we can move the court\nfor entry of our protective order.\n\nAlso, you have not acknowledged my email to David of 5/28/15, in which I noted that for several requests, particularly\nthose seeking manufacturing/inspection related documents, Michelin has asked you to identify your defect theories and\nthe tire components/manufacturing processes at issue so that Michelin can identify and produce relevant documents.\n!n order for Michelin to locate the appropriate responsive documents and produce them within the time frame\ndiscussed above, we need you to provide this information as soon as possible.

The\n          burden is on MicheliI1 when it Vlithholds ru1d conceals its ow11 documentation and\n          evidence. Si11ce all of the docum·~nts requested are Michelin is docIDnents, Michelin\n          knows exactly which documents ii withheld and did not produce. Plaintiffs have been\n          waiting for more than lhree (3) mcnths for this docurneutation with false promises and\n          assuran.ces.\n\n                  Notably, to assure that th;:se sher1an.igans did not occur, wl1ile wa1t1ng for\n          Michelin's disclosure over t11e last 8everal ~11ontl1s·, Plaintiffs' com1sel took. the\n          initiative and· repeatedly reached out to- J'vfichelin 's defense coun.<;el and perfo1med\n          1nany rneets and. confers about the 011tstandin.g discovery, All to no avail. Michelin's\n          production at the e11d of June wa:; grossly defective and deficient-·- eve11 after these\n          r1u1nerous 1neets and confers.\n\n                  After Plaintiffs finally. rec('ived the dcficier1t Michelin prodt1ctior1, we vvrote a\n          letter documenting Michelin's totd lack of production on July 16, 2015-20 days ago.\n          Still, up to today, 011 August 4, :~Ol5i no 011e frorn Micl1elin or Michelin:s cou113el\n          contacted m about it. In fact, Michelin sat on this letter for about lhree (3) weeks and\n          did absolutely nothing. Not once did Michelin through its multiple defense counsel\n          reach <)ut to us by letter, pho11e call, perso11ally or e-1nail. Moreover, I saw you for a\n          full day last week during the depositions om clients including the quadriplegic mom\n          Obdulia Medina, and not once did you ~;tate that Michelin had proble1ns understanding\n\n\n          ' Jn the future, please direct all correspondence to us by e-mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         MR 0285\n\f August 4, 2015\n Page 2\n\n\n our leiter cortce1ning its reprehensit le lack of clisclosure.\n\n       Consequently, your letter of today· is nothiI1g but a self-serving letter only sent\nafter! called you today about Michelin's lack of production. Still, Micbelin had no\nfarther production to offer. Therefore, the meet and confer already took place not only\ntoday but throughout the wait for the outstanding discovery. As such, Plaintiffs much\nmore than met and complied with the letter, spirit and intent of Rule 191.2 of Tex. R.\nCiv. Proc.\n\n        Still, in s.pite ofMic.helin's steadfast refusal to produce the doct11ne11ts and eve11\nafter receiving your letter, we attentpted ·yet arlother rneet arid con.fer just minutes ago\nwhen Luis 1.eJt you a voic.ernail. Still, in_ a final effort before we file our Motior1) we\nwould be willh1g to 1neet and confer with Michelin this afternoon at a ti1ne conve11ier11.\n\n       Micheli11's actions are even more egregious because at the sa1ne ti111e .'Michelir1\nhides and c011ceals releva11t docu1r_ents, I)laintiff.'l have made the tire available, 11ave\noffered the1nselves for depositioru (which have take11 place) and made the vel1icle\navailable for an unfettered ir1spectic11 for-Michelin's experts.\n\n         Enough is enough. Obduli1's life - as you saw last week - is a day-to-day\nstruggle to survive without any resemblance to the life she led before the tire failure.\nThere is no time to waste.

The tire in question was designed by\n\n Michelin Americas Research & Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n became a division ofMNA on January I, 2008, and manufactured by MNA during the 3 lst week\n\n of2001 at its Dothan, Alabama plant. Unless otherwise indicated, MNA's responses are limited\n\nto infonnation concerning the tire in question and tires built to the specification in place for the\n\ntire in question at the I)othan, Alabama plant during the sixth months before and six months after\n\nthe date of manufacture of the tire in question (the \"relevant scope').\n\n                                 TRADE SECRETS OBJECTION\n\n          :MNA objects to many of the discovery requests because they seek information and/or\n\ndocuments that are of a confidential, proprietary or commercially sensitive nature to MNA,\n\nexempt from discovery under notions of constitutional privacy and/or that may be covered by or\n\nbe the subject of express or implied confidentiality, secrecy or nonpublication agreements or\n\nunderstandings. To the extent necessal'y, MNA objects to the discovery requests in that they\n\nseek the discovery of trade secret information and documents, including confidential research,\n\ndevelopment and technical information. MNA states that information and documents responsive\n\nto some of the discovery requests may have been withheld because these discovery requests seek\n\nprivileged information and privileged docun1ents that constitute the trade secrets of MNA,\n\nDisclosure of these b·ade secrets would, result in substantial prejudice and harm to MNA.\n\n'fherefore, MNA contends it is essential to MNA's operations that its work and documents\n\nremain confidential.\n\n          Texas law protects the disclosure ofMNA's trade secrets. A trade secret may consist of\n\nany trade formula, pattern, device or compilation of information that is used in one's business\n\n\n4530886                                          3\n\n\n\n                                                                                               PRFP00049\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       MR 0293\n\f and gives one an opportunity to obtain an advantage over co1npetitors who do not know or use it.\n\n Computer Assoc. Int 11. Inc. v. Altai. Inc., 918 S,W.2d453, 453 ('fex. 1996) (citing Fiyde CJml,__Y,.\n\n Huffines, 314 S.W.2d 763, 776 (1958)),\n\n          MNA's confidential policies, research, development and technical information are\n\n valuable and crucial trade secrets of MNA that give it an advantage over its competitors in a\n\n highly competitive and secretive industry.       Moreover, MNA makes reasonable effo11s to\n\nmaintain the secrecy of this information, the information is of substantial value to MNA, the\n\ninformation would be very valuable to MNA's competitors, and the infonnation derives its value\n\nby virtue of the effort of its creation and lack of dissemination. Accordingly :MNA believes such\n\ninformation constitutes a trade secret and should be protected. from disclosure.\n\n          Unless otherwise stated in its responses, MNA is not withholding any privileged\n\ndocuments/information within the relevant scope. However, to the extent plaintiffs do not agree\n\nwith the scope of :MNA's discovery responses, MNA reserves the right to have its objections to\n\nscope ruled upon prior to expanding the scope of its responses and its search Jar responsive\n\nand/or privileged documents/information.\n\n          Subject to the foregoing, MNA hereby answers the individual requests as follows:\n\n                         RESPQNSE TO REQUESTS EQR PRODUCTION\n\nREQUEST FOR PRO!JUCTJON N0.-1;.\n\n        Identify and produce the organizational charts showing the functions and reporting\nstructure of Michelin North America1s departments, divisions, or units, whether domestic or\nforeign, responsible, either directly or indirectly, for: research, design and development;\nmanufacturing and production; quality control of the subject tire and the 1nodel tires.\n\n\n\n          After a reasonable and diligent search, MNA has not located any docurnents responsive\n\nto this request relating to the Dothan, Alabama plant during the relevant scope.

MNA further\n\nobjects to the extent this request seeks or attempts to seek infonnation that constitutes\n\ncommercially sensitive, confidential business information ofMNA.

(\"MNA\"), competently testify as follows:\n\n      1. This affidavit is based on my personal knowledge and my review of information\n\n         available to me in my role at MNA. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n         competent to execute this Affidavit.\n\n      2. I have never been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude.\n\n      3. I am a Senior Technical Advisor employed by MNA. I was employed with Michelin\n\n         Americas Research and Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n         became a division of MNA on January 1, 2008, from January 2007 to December 2011.\n\n         Since May 1999, I have been employed by MNA. During my employment with MNA\n\n         and MARC, I have become familiar with the tires that are designed by MARC and\n\n         manufactured by MNA, as well as the design and manufacturing procedures used.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0335\n\f4. I am familiar with the process by which tire specifications are developed, with the\n\n   composition and dimensions of certain tires MNA has designed and manufactured during\n\n   my employment, with MNA manufacturing processes and equipment, and with the\n\n   efforts that MNA makes to protect its proprietary and trade secret information.\n\n5. The Subject Tire is a P255/70R16 109S Michelin LTX MIS bearing DOT number\n\n   B7LBEVUX3 l 01 and manufactured by MNA in its Dothan, Alabama plant in the 31st\n\n   week of 2001.\n\n6. A tire is built to a single green tire and a single cured tire specification. The Subject Tire\n\n   was manufactured pursuant to a particular specification in place for P255/70R16 109S\n\n   LTX MIS tires manufactured at MN A's Dothan, AL plant during the 31st week of 2001.\n\n7. The \"P\" designation means \"passenger.\" The \"255\" is this tire's nominal section width in\n\n   millimeters. The \"70\" is the tire's aspect ratio - the sidewall height is 70% of the tire's\n\n   width. The \"16\" is the tire's inner diameter in inches, which means that the tire fits on a\n\n    16\" wheel. The tire's service description, \"109S,\" includes the load index (109), which\n\n   means that the tire is designed to support loads of 2271 pounds at 35 psi inflation\n\n   pressure, and the speed rating (S), which indicates that the tire is ceiiified to carry a load,\n\n   under specified conditions, at a maximum speed of 112 mph.\n\n8. \"Common green\" tires are tires that share the same specifications except for exterior\n\n   moldings. The model of the Subject Tire has three common green tires that also were\n\n   manufactured at the Dothan, AL plant. With the exception of these common green tires,\n\n   there are no other tires that were made to the same green tire specifications as the Subject\n\n   Tire.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0336\n\f9. Throughout my employment with MARC and MNA, MNA has manufactured steel belted\n\n   radial tires for a wide variety of passenger vehicles, light trucks, medium trucks, heavy\n\n   trucks, and special purposes such as high performance tires, and aircraft tires. During\n\n   2001, the year the Subject Tire was manufactured, MNA manufactured approximately\n\n   1500 different tire designs at its various plants in No11h America. The design of these\n\n   tires often varies significantly depending on the particular service applications such as\n\n   highway, mud and snow, all-season, off-road, and high performance.\n\nI 0. A tire is a highly engineered, scientifically developed, complex laminate structure. It\n\n   incorporates elements of the disciplines of polymer chemistry and mechanical\n\n   engineering, among others.\n\n11. For a tire to perform properly, it must be engineered so that the numerous components\n\n   and rubber compounds work together to carry the intended load at the inflation pressures\n\n   appropriate for the service applications. Thus, even tires bearing the same marketing\n\n   label or \"name\", like the \"LTX MIS\", have different design features to accommodate the\n\n   intended load and expected service application.\n\n12. Most modern automotive tires share some basic features. Virtually all tubeless tires have\n\n   a tread, belt assemblies, a body ply or plies, an inner liner, and bead wires. Steel belt\n\n   assemblies typically consist of two or more steel belts with a rubber compound that\n\n   surrounds and coats the steel cables. Textile body ply or plies generally consist of one or\n\n   more plies of textile cord coated with another rubber compound. The inner liner consists\n\n   of a different rubber compound and performs a function similar to that of an inner tube in\n\n   a tube-type tire, helping the tubeless tire maintain air pressure. The bead wires are two\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0337\n\f   hoop-shaped bundles of wire encased in rubber and located at the tire's inner edges,\n\n   which help hold the tire flush against the rim flange and anchor the tire's components.\n\n13. Most modern automotive tires are assembled in stages as a laminate structure and then\n\n   placed in a mold and vulcanized, or \"cured.\" Vulcanization consists of exposing the\n\n   assembled tire to high temperature and pressure for a pre-determined time; this process\n\n   causes various chemical changes in the rubber compounds, causes bonds to form between\n\n   the tire's various components, and increases the rubber's strength, resilience and\n\n   durability. A tire that has been assembled but not yet vulcanized is referred to as a \"green\n\n   tire.\"\n\n14. Despite this common basic strncture, however, it would be a gross oversimplification to\n\n   say that all passenger and light truck tires with a steel-belted radial construction are\n\n   similar in design. Although certain tires may share one or more common components or\n\n   compounds, the unique performance requirements of each tire will lead to design\n\n   differences between them.\n\n15. There are many ways in which tire designs may differ. For example, tire designs may\n\n   differ according to (I) the basic classification as a passenger, light truck, truck or\n\n   specialty tire; (2) inner diameter size; (3) width; (4) aspect ratio (the tire's width as\n\n   compared to its sidewall height); (5) load index or load capacity; (6) component\n\n   materials;    (7) intended   use   or   application;   (8) bead   wire   design;   (9) sidewall\n\n   reinforcements; (10) speed rating; (11) recommended inflation pressures; (l 2) tread\n\n   design; and (13) the use of additional components such as belt edge wedges and extra\n\n   strips or plies.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0338\n\f16. Most tires are broadly classified into four categories: passenger tires, light truck tires,\n\n   truck tires, and specialty-use tires (such as commercial tires, temporary spare tires, or\n\n   trailer tires). There are substantial differences in the design of tires in each classification.\n\n   Tires in one classification are not substantially similar to tires in another classification.\n\n   There are no Michelin tires in one classification that are \"common green\" to tires in\n\n   another classification. The federal regulations in place in 2001 governing light truck\n\n   tires, 49 C.F.R. § 571.119, was different than those governing passenger car tires like the\n\n   tire in question, 49 C.F.R. § 571.109.\n\n17. Plaintiffs' Requests for Production seek information on all \"Michelin LTX M/S tires.\"\n\n   The names of tire lines, such as \"LTX M/S,\" the line of the Subject Tire, are marketing\n\n   labels used by MNA to describe many tires that are suitable for use in a sport utility\n\n   vehicle (\"SUV\") or light truck application. They are not a designation of a tire's design\n\n   or a specific set of manufacturing specifications. The \"LTX MIS\" marketing label has\n\n   been used for at least 20 years, for multiple sizes, load ranges, and applications of tires.\n\n   Futther, \"LTX MIS\" tires are made in multiple sizes and load ranges, for different vehicle\n\n   fitments and applications, all of which would have different designs. At the time the tire\n\n   in question was manufactured in 2001, the \"LTX MIS\" label was used for approximately\n\n   40 different tire sizes. MNA uses many different marketing labels for its tires.\n\n18. For example, the LTX MIS tire line and its common green lines manufactured between\n\n   1998 and 2003 would encompass approximately 54 tire models built to more than 5000\n\n   tire specifications, and approximately 19.2 million different tires.        These tires were\n\n   manufactured at 5 different MNA and MNA (Canada), Inc. plants in North America.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0339\n\f19. All tires manufactured under the \"L TX MIS\" marketing label are not substantially\n\n   similar.   These tires differ in design in many ways, including size, load capacity,\n\n   components, number of plies, types of plies, recommended pressures, speed ratings, tread\n\n   depths, and intended applications.\n\n20. The Subject Tire is a 16\" P-Metric (Passenger) tire; however, the LTX M/S line\n\n   encompasses LT-Metric, P-Metric and Flotation tires.           Moreover, the LTX MIS line\n\n   includes tires with rim diameters ranging from 15\" to 17'' section widths from 205\n\n   millimeters to 285 millimeters, and with total diameters from 27\" to 32.8\". These tires of\n\n   different sizes, dimensions and applications are necessarily of different designs, and are\n\n   not substantially similar to each other.\n\n21. Tires of different sizes do not, as a general rule, merely have propo1tionally larger\n\n   dimensions; there are a number of other specification changes, as well. For example, an\n\n   LTX MIS 15\" tire will have very different performance requirements and expected\n\n   service conditions than an LTX MIS 17'' tire.           The carcass strength, load-carrying\n\n   capacity, inflation pressure, rubber compounds, number of carcass plies, and densities of\n\n   steel belt cables or polyester carcass ply cords may all be different, depending on tire size\n\n   and expected vehicle fitment. The tire designer will use different components, materials,\n\n   and configurations for different tire sizes, depending on the performance goals for the\n\n   tire. Thus, tires of different sizes are not substantially similar to each other.\n\n22. The LTX M/S line includes tires designed for original equipment fitments as well as tires\n\n   designed for the replacement market. Tires designed specifically for fitments on new\n\n   vehicles may be tuned specifically to meet the requirements of the original equipment\n\n   programs. They may be made of different components than replacement market tires,\n\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0340\n\f   have different tread depths and designs than replacement market tires, and have different\n\n   performance profiles than replacement market tires. Thus, original equipment tires may\n\n   have very different designs and constructions than replacement market tires, and are not\n\n   necessarily substantially similar to replacement market tires.\n\n23. The LTX M/S line of tires includes tires with different aspect ratios ranging from 65 to\n\n   85. The term \"aspect ratio\" describes the relationship between the height and width of\n\n   the tire.   More precisely, aspect ratio is the ratio between the \"section height\" (the\n\n   distance from the top of the tread down to an imaginary line running from bead to bead at\n\n   the bottom of the tire) and \"section width\" (the distance from the outermost bulge of one\n\n   sidewall to the other) when the tire is mounted on a rim that is 70% of the tire section\n\n   width and inflated to a prescribed pressure. A tire with a high aspect ratio may be a tall,\n\n   skinny tire, while one with a low aspect ratio may be a short, squatly tire. These different\n\n   structures are affected in different ways by the loads and forces that they encounter in\n\n   service, and the design of tires with different aspect ratios differ significantly. Tires of\n\n   different aspect ratios are not substantially similar.\n\n24. The LTX MIS line of tires encompasses tires with different load indexes and speed\n\n   ratings, which also make a difference in the application for which the tire is suitable. The\n\n   LTX M/S tire line includes tires with load indexes from 97 to 123 and speed ratings from\n\n   R to H. For example, an LTX M/S tire with \"H\" speed rating (130 mph) would have a\n\n   significantly different design than the Subject Tire, which has an \"S\" speed rating\n\n   (l 12mph), to accommodate the increased heat and centrifugal forces the tire would be\n\n   expected to withstand at higher speeds. For example, a P205/75Rl 5 97S LTX M/S,\n\n   which has a load index of97, is rated to carry a maximum load of 1435 pounds at 35 psi,\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0341\n\f   whereas the Subject Tire, which has a load index of 109, is rated to carry a maximum\n\n   load of2271 pounds at 35 psi. The design of these tires is different to accommodate the\n\n   differences in load and expected application. Thus, tires of different load indexes and\n\n   speed ratings are not substantially similar.\n\n25. Tires within the LTX MIS line differ according to their component materials, even when\n\n   the basic type, size, load index, and speed rating are the same. Among other differences,\n\n   tires within the LTX MIS line made in different plants contain different tread compounds,\n\n   and undertread compounds. In addition, steel belt construction and strength, as well as\n\n   polyester ply construction and strength, can differ. The tread compound is the material\n\n   comprising the outermost layer of the tire in the paii of the tire that is intended to contact\n\n   the road; the undertread compound is the material comprising the next layer down,\n\n   between the tread and steel belt assembly. Tire designs within the LTX MIS line can\n\n   differ for many other reasons, including tread designs, bead designs, recommended\n\n   inflation pressures, sidewall reinforcement, and others. Tires with these differences in\n\n   component materials and design features are not substantially similar.\n\n26. The LTX MIS line includes tires manufactured with 2-belt and 3-belt configurations.\n\n   Tires with different numbers of belts are not substantially similar.\n\n27. MNA uses many different rubber formulations in its tires, including different rubber\n\n   formulations between tires within the LTX MIS tire line. For example, all passenger and\n\n   light truck tires contain different types of rubber.     Rubber formulas in replacement-\n\n   market tires may differ from those used in certain original equipment applications.\n\n   MNA, through its MARC division, researches, tests, and develops the rubber compounds\n\n   used in the construction of tires. The type of rubber compound ultimately used in each\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 8-\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0342\n\f   component will affect the tire's performance results. Even within a single manufacturing\n\n   facility, the rubber compound formulas used may differ depending on the size and\n\n   application of the tire. Tires that use different rubber formulations are not substantially\n\n   similar.\n\n28. Tires are not substantially similar simply because they use the same belt skim compound.\n\n   Tires with the same belt skim but different sizes, classifications, load ranges, speed\n\n   ratings, and/or applications will have different designs and different service life, and are\n\n   not substantially similar tires.\n\n29. Tire designs evolve over time as new technology, materials, and equipment are\n\n   developed and the tire manufacturing processes and procedures in any given plant\n\n   change. Although bearing the same marketing label and size designation, tires that are\n\n   manufactured under different specifications are of different designs. Over the period of\n\n   time during which the model of the Subject Tire was made, changes were made to its\n\n   design and specifications.\n\n30. Tire designs generally will differ for tires manufactured at different facilities. Because\n\n   MNA operates facilities formerly owned by three different manufacturers (which use\n\n   different processes), manufacturing specifications and component compounds are\n\n   frequently different for tires otherwise of the same marketing label and size designation,\n\n   to account for varying plant-specific technology and available equipment, including\n\n   mixing equipment, tire building equipment, and curing methods.\n\n31. No two MNA plants have the exact same equipment and manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0343\n\f32. Specifications are developed for the equipment and processes at a particular\n\n   manufacturing plant.       Tires manufactured at one plant are produced based on a\n\n    specification different than the specification used at other plants.\n\n33. In the last thirty (30) years, MNA has manufactured tires under several thousand different\n\n   brand names and sizes. Each of these tire types is of a different design. Within each\n\n   category, the designs have changed multiple times as the specifications evolved.\n\n34. In the last ten (! 0) years alone, MNA has manufactured several hundred million tires, to\n\n   tens of thousands of different specifications, including those marketed under the\n\n   \"Michelin,\" \"Uniroyal,\" \"BF Goodrich,\" and various private brand name.\n\n35. Certain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's adjustment data, including comparisons of\n\n   adjustment data concerning tires manufactured with and without nylon cap plies.\n\n36. Adjustment data is information collected by MNA that records the number of tires\n\n   returned, as well as the condition of the returned tire, without regard to cause.\n\n37. One condition which may be discerned by a trained inspector is a tread or tread/belt\n\n   \"separation.\" A \"separation\" refers to a crack or potential crack between two of a tire's\n\n   components. A \"separation,\" if actually present, does not mean or imply that the tire\n\n   became disabled. It also does not mean or imply that the tire is defective in design or\n\n   manufacture. If the inspector observed a tread/belt separation in a returned tire, that\n\n   condition would be noted and the adjustment would be coded accordingly.\n\n38. Tread/belt detachments resulting from separations occur infrequently, but they have\n\n   occurred and do occur in steel belted radial tires generally, regardless of their size,\n\n   design, or intended use.\n\n39. A tread/belt separation can occur in any steel belted radial tire.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0344\n\f40. A tread/belt separation in a tire does not indicate a defect in the design or manufacture of\n\n   the tire because there are many different causes for tread/belt separation that are\n\n   independent of the design and manufacture of the tire. Numerous other factors, such as\n\n   tire overloading, under inflation, unrepaired or improperly repaired punctures or cuts,\n\n   damage from road hazards, to name a few, can lead to tread/belt separation in a properly\n\n   designed and manufactured tire.\n\n41. The MNA's design and manufacturing specifications, specification changes, testing and\n\n   design-related documents requested by Plaintiffs in their discovery requests contain\n\n   highly protected trade secrets of MNA.          In addition, Plaintiffs requests call for the\n\n   production of other highly protected trade secrets of MNA, including but not limited to\n\n   information concerning MNA's research and development, formulas, tire adjustment\n\n   processes and analysis, marketing strategies, internal research and studies, propriety\n\n   manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n42. Furthermore, MNA's adjustment data is of significant value to MNA because it reveals\n\n   MNA's processes and analysis, and because it is not known to MNA's competitors. This\n\n   information constitutes valuable trade secrets of MNA and gives MNA an advantage over\n\n   its competitors.    Disclosure of this information to those competitors would cause\n\n   irreparable damage to MNA.\n\n43. Ce1tain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's design and manufacturing specifications,\n\n   specification changes, testing and design-related documents, research and development,\n\n   tire adjustment processes and analysis, internal research and studies, propriety\n\n   manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n   All such documents are highly protected trade secrets ofMNA.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0345\n\f44. MNA spends millions of dollars each year on research, development, testing of tires and\n\n   their component parts, and developing its proprietary design and manufacturing\n\n   technologies. Disclosure of this information to those competitors would cause irreparable\n\n   damage to MNA's competitive advantage.\n\n45. MNA takes extreme care to protect this information from being disclosed because this\n\n   information is what gives MNA an advantage in the competitive field of tire design and\n\n   allows it to deliver economic value to its customers. MNA derives economic value and\n\n   competitive advantage by not having that information available in the public domain.\n\n   Any disclosure, direct or indirect, of such trade secrets and confidential information\n\n   would severely and permanently impair MNA's competitive position.\n\n46. Disclosure of MNA's confidential information to multiple individuals would subject\n\n   MNA to a substantial risk of subsequent disclosure to MNA's competitors, the\n\n   consequences of which would be irreversible.\n\n47. The steps that MNA has in place to protect the secrecy of its confidential design and\n\n   development information include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n          (a)     An 8-foot high cyclone topped with barbed wire fence surrounds the\n\n                  perimeter ofMARC's facility and premises in Greenville, South Carolina;\n\n          (b)     All employees access the premises through a gated entrance by use of a\n\n                 limited access turnstile and badge reader. Visitors are given access only\n\n                 after registering with a security officer, presenting identification and\n\n                  naming the specific employee with whom they have business. Thereafter,\n\n                  the MNA employee escorts or supervises the visitor(s), who must display\n\n                  \"Visitor\" credentials while on the premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\n\n                                                                                         MR 0346\n\f          (c)     The security gates are manned Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to\n\n                  5:00 p.m. aud patrolled by security all other hours, weekends, and\n\n                  holidays.    In addition, the entire MARC campus and its perimeter is\n\n                  monitored 24 hours a day by surveillance cameras;\n\n          (d)     While vehicles generally are not allowed on MNA's premises, if a vehicle\n\n                  does enter, it is subject to a random search by security before it is\n\n                  permitted to exit;\n\n          (e)     To the extent MNA maintains its confidential design and development\n\n                  information electronically, it is stored in a secure, limited access database;\n\n          (f)     MNA's       employees   execute   stringent   non-disclosure    and    secrecy\n\n                  agreements as a condition of their employment;\n\n          (g)     MNA's vendors sign confidentiality agreements before they are provided\n\n                  access to any documents or information regarding MNA's work for them;\n\n          (h)     The research and development information developed by MNA at MARC\n\n                  is maintained at MARC; and\n\n          (i)     Certain areas on the MARC campus are accessible only to MARC\n\n                  personnel with heightened security access, and are not accessible to other\n\n                  MNA employees.\n\n48. MNA employs these extreme efforts to maintain the confidentiality of information\n\n   relating to its testing, research, technology, processes, designs, compilations of\n\n   information, and formulas because it is this information that gives MNA and its clients an\n\n   advantage in the competitive field of tire design and manufacture.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0347\n\f49. I understand Plaintiffs are requesting documents and/or testimony concerning one or\n\n   more ofMNA's rubber compound formulas.\n\n50. For many decades, MNA has spent millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of man\n\n   hours researching, testing, and developing rubber formulas in an effort to increase the\n\n   performance of its tires. The rubber compound formulas are of significant value to MNA\n\n   because they are not known to MNA's competitors.\n\n51. MNA believes that its superior rubber compound formulas are an extremely critical factor\n\n   in its ability to maintain its competitive advantage over its rivals.\n\n52. Because a tire is vulcanized during manufacture (a process that alters the tire's chemistry\n\n   and dimensions), it cannot be \"reverse engineered.\" Thus, a competitor cannot recreate\n\n   all of its design specifications simply by purchasing and analyzing a tire, nor can a\n\n   competitor take a tire apaii and determine the components in the rubber, the length of\n\n   time the rubber is cured, or the machinery used.\n\n53. In addition to the measures discussed above, MNA takes even more extreme steps to\n\n   protect its compound formula information. Only MNA employees who have a business\n\n   need to know the information have access to the formulas. Of MNA's thousands of\n\n   employees, only a few know or have access to the rubber compound formulas.\n\n54. Any disclosure, direct or indirect, of MNA's compound formulas would severely and\n\n   permanently impair MNA 's competitive position. Once disclosed, this damage could not\n\n   be repaired, even if the disclosure was inadvertent and/or subject to a confidentiality\n\n   order.\n\n55. Plaintiffs have also requested information and documents relating to MNA's\n\n   manufacturing and quality procedures.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 14 -\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0348\n\f56. Like all tire manufacturers, MNA keeps secret its specific design, manufacturing, and\n\n   quality assurance processes. MNA's specific manufacturing processes and equipment are\n\n   not known to MNA's competitors or the general public.            MNA has developed the\n\n   processes, including manufacturing techniques, machinery, and methods of production,\n\n   for many decades at a cost of many millions of dollars. MNA also spends millions of\n\n   dollars every year replacing and updating facilities and equipment. A principal part of\n\n   MNA's competitive edge in the tire industry derives from its proprietary and unique\n\n   manufacturing methods and equipment. Most of MNA's processes are not patented for\n\n   fear of losing their secrecy.\n\n57. The divulgence ofMNA's proprietary manufacturing and quality processes to the public\n\n   or to a competitor would cause an unacceptably high risk of irreparable harm and injury.\n\n   If third parties were allowed access to these trade secrets, they could take advantage of\n\n   proprietary information which MNA has spent years and millions of dollars developing,\n\n   and which MNA's competitors could not duplicate on their own without a similar\n\n   investments of time, expe1tise, and money, and perhaps not even then. The damage that\n\n   could be created by the loss of trade secrets is a direct financial threat to MNA, its parent\n\n   and affiliated corporations, and risks the loss ofMNA's competitive edge and, potentially\n\n   the employment of thousands of employees tlll'oughout the United States and worldwide.\n\n58. MNA spends millions of dollars and countless man hours developing manufacturing\n\n   processes and quality procedures. Specifically, MNA's building procedures employed at\n\n   the Dothan plant were developed over an extensive amount of time and at tremendous\n\n   expense.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0349\n\f59. MNA takes extraordinary measures to maintain the secrecy of its proprietary\n\n   manufacturing processes and equipment, including the following:\n\n          (a)    Plants are not open to the public. Facilities are surrounded by fences. The\n\n                 Dothan plant maintains a security department with security systems and\n\n                 security officers.\n\n          (b)    Additional security controls are imposed in certain departments because of\n\n                 the highly confidential manufacturing and industrialization work that is\n\n                 carried on in those departments. Persons with access authority are subject\n\n                 to strict control, and employees with access authority are required to\n\n                 execute confidentiality agreements.       Employees are not permitted to\n\n                 photograph or videotape the interior of the plant and are not permitted to\n\n                 remove documentary trade secrets except for controlled, business\n\n                 purposes.\n\n          (c)    MNA does not generally permit third persons to enter any plant unless\n\n                 there is a legitimate business reason. Each visitor must wear a badge\n\n                 denoting his or her status and the extent of their access within the plant\n\n                 was limited based on business need and prior approval, with signed\n\n                 secrecy agreements in many instances. The MNA employee with whom\n\n                 the visitor is meeting has to accompany the visitor until the conference is\n\n                 terminated and the visitor leaves the plant.\n\n          (d)    Many of the production machines at the MNA plants are designed, built,\n\n                 and/or modified and installed by MNA itself.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\n\n                                                                                         MR 0350\n\f                (e)   Employees at MNA plants sign stringent non-disclosure and secrecy\n\n                      agreements as a condition of their employment.\n\n   60. The tire development and manufacturing industry is extremely competitive and is\n\n       dependent on continuing research and development of new tire products and component\n\n       parts.\n\n   61. The information concerning MNA's manufacturing processes, design processes, testing\n\n       and testing methods, green tire specifications, compounds, and components of tires,\n\n       including those pertaining to the Subject Tire, is of significant value to MNA because it\n\n       reveals MNA's design, testing, and analytical processes. T his is information that is not\n\n       known to MNA's competitors. Disclosure of this information to those competitors would\n\n       cause irreparable damage to MNA's competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\nFURTHER, AFFIANT SAITH NAUGHT.\n\n\n\n\nSWORN to and subscribed

Has Michelin produced the docu1nents?\n                 A.      The answer is an absolute: NO.\n\n\n1 Please see Plaintiffs' Separate State1nent of Moving Counsel attached as Exhibit JJ, •vhich proves\nPlaintiff<;' repeated meets and confers with Michelin, Please also sec Plaintiffs' multiple exchanges of\ncorrespondence with Michelin attached hereto as Exhibit G. Regardless of undersigned counsel's\ncountless efforts to reach out, Michelin continues to refuse production of necessary evidence for Plaintiffs\nto fairly adjudicate their clahns. Jn other words, PlaintijjS still tlo not ltave the doc11n1ents,\n2\n  Michelin's \"trade secret\" argu1nent holds no \\Yater. First, \\tlichelin failed to prove the requested\ninfor111ation is a trade secret because the law requires that the \"subject 1natter of a trade secret nlust be\nsecret.\" Sten art & ~<:;tevenson ,'Jervices, Inc. v. /ierv-Tech, Inc., 879 S.W.2d 89, 95 (Tex. App,-l·Iouston\n             1\n\n\n[14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied). Michelin's only evidence of trade secrets are conclusory state1nents.\nSecond, there is already a Michelin Protective ()rdcr in place that protects it. TI1erefore, Michelin's\ntrade secret objection is a red herring.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          MR 0434\n\f        TherefOre, Plaintiffs file their Reply in support of their Motion to Compel to talk about\n\nthe real issue: Michelin's refusal to produce documents. For manufacturing purposes, the\n\nei1tire I..,TX M/S li11e is the same. The physical evidence proves it. Michelin's affidavit is yet\n\nanotl1er smokescreen and more of the same attempt to mislead intentionally and blatantly.\n\n'fhercfore, Plaintiffs respectfully the IIonorahle c:ourt lo read the attached l\"ederal Judge Amy\n\n'fotenbcrg Order (attached hereto as Exhibit A) to understand the depth, extent and range of\n\ndeceit Michelin engages in to prevent production of docu1nents and trial on the merits.\n\n        c:once111ing the afiidavit, one (1) thougl1t co1nes to mind: a nicely wrapped turd even with\n\na bow is still a turd. Its Michelin's litigation-made contents from Vru1eaton Price arc hogwash.\n\nIt claims that the tires sought by Plaintiffs are conipletely different3 because of their width, rim\n\nsize, load indexes, aspect ratio, etc., etc. Nonsense. In the !ast case l>laintiffS' counsel had\n\nagainst this same defendru1t, Michelin provided adjustment data, general principles, aspect\n\nspecifications, design specifications for a n1ultitude of LTX M/S tires with all kinds of different\n\ntire widths, 1in1 sizes, aspect ratios and speed ratings. I'hc common deno1ninator? Michelin\n\nLTX MJS tires 1nanufactured at J)othan - just like the subject tire.\n\n\n\n-----------\n3\n Moreover, oven if the design and 1nanufacture of different sizes of the LTX M/S were diffCrent - 'vhich\nthey are not - Plaintif'tS are still entitled to discovery about alternative designs w'itb different\nfeatures:\n\n                Funda1nentaUy, the scope of discovery is obviously much broader\n                than the scoue of admissible evidence, and evidence of incident.,\n                involving other products besides the exact model at issue can be\n                admissible, and therefore. obviously, dis(~overable.\n\nIn re J{xn1ark Mfg.

Mothers, sisters,\n\nhusbands, -fathers. All innocent viclin1s initially injured severely by the defective J_,TX then by\n\nMichelin's awful litigation tactics - both as a result of Michelin's secretive defective and\n\nshoddy tire design, manufacturing and inspection practices. t'or in;;tance, in Velo, there were\n\nseven (7) passengers inside the SlJV. One (1) was lcilled, One (I) becmnc a quadriplegic.\n\nThree (3) suffered traun1atic brain injuries. And all suffered a inullitude of other injuries. So\n\nevery one of Michelin's tread belt separations leads to many, many n1ore victims including\n\nvicti1ns not at the scene of t11e crash. l\"or instance, the dead father left ;;everal children witl1out\n\na dad. T'he quadriplegic inother left ;;everal children with a ;;evercly disabled mother. So, one\n\n(I) single defective tire injured and victinlized n1ore than ten (10) individuals.\n\n       'I11ere are so many inorc. Plaintiffs know this because in Velo, when it;; back was\n\nagainst the wall due to its lack of disclosure, Michelin was forced to cough up its own intc111al\n\nnumbers about the L]'X MIS tire line defeciive returns·· irrespective of width, 1i1n size, aspcci\n\nratios or s1)eed ratings. To put it mildly, the evidence was frightening.\n\n   II. LTX M/S's Plague ofJ)efccts\n\n       For starters, n1ore than 700 (inst ft·on1 one of its hundreds of dealers and the largest tire\n\nretailer in the world - Discount 1'ire) of its defective I..TX MIS tires were returned for belt edge\n\nseparations. In addition, over l,000 tires were returned to Michelin';; dealers for ride vibration\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     MR 0437\n\f    a precursor to tread belt separation.    1·his staggering number of many n1ore than 1.500\n\ndefective tires den1onstrates, docu1nents and proves that Michelin h:new- as early as 2001 (10\n\nyears bef'Ore the incident) - that its IJ TX MIS tire line was dru1gerously defective. Michelin had\n\nto disgorge all this evidence ti·om the I,'fX MIS line whether they were 235s, 245s, 265s, 275s\n\ntread width or whether it is 16 or 17 rin1 size or whether they had ditferent speed ratings\n\nsiinilarly to what PlaintiffS are asking here.\n\n         Instead of warning the public about its defective product, 6, Michelin did and continues\n\nto do the exact opposite: conceal from the public and its consun1ers that. its IJ l'X line posed and\n\nposes unreasonable risks of deadly danger to its consumers.              This adjustme11t/warranty\n\ninfo11nation and evidence was provided in Velo to counsel, undersigned counsel used it ii1 their\n\ncase to annihilate Michelin. ·rhis is the only reason Michelin now refuses to produce it. It is\n\nimportant to note that the defective nature of the 1:rx MIS line ru1d its injury rate is not a\n\nnational scandal because in every case, Michelin blackmails the Plaintiffs into protective orders\n\nand nan·ow discovery or will not produce anything.\n\n    lll. Texas Scope of J)iscovery\n\n        rrhus, lil(e any crin1e, there is a motive behind Michelin's stonewalling: prevent the\n\ndisclosure of Michelin's shoddy tire design, manufacturing, inspection practices ·-directly at\n\nissue in this case - to prevent the public knowledge of its defective tires. fortunately, Texas\n\nlaw does not pe1mit it.

(e.a.).\n\n        Michelin is not your typical defendant.

Exactly a year ago,\n\nMichelin and its legal representatives 1nisled the Court to ren1ovc tl1c ease to the federal district\n\nby clailning that J>laintiffS did not serve 'fexas resident, Mundo Cars. S}ee Notice of Rernoval at 4-\n\n5, This was a n1istruth and was in1111ediatcly exposed by Plaintiffs' counsel and documented by\n\nFederal Judge David Godbey:\n\n                 The Court notes that MNA also removed this case on the basis\n                 that Mundo had not been properly served. In their motion to\n                 remand. Plaintiffs established that they served Mundo.\n\n,Judge Go<lbey's March 24, 2015 ()rder Granting Reniancl, p. 3,footnote 2. (c.a.).\n\n        Michelin and its legal counsel knew their n1istruth to the federal district court would be\n\neasily exposed. It was blatant and easily dispelled by physical evide11ce. Still, they did not care\n\nbecause in the end, they got their reward. They delayed the case for an entire year. No scruples,\n\nNo concerns. No honor. No good fl:iith. 'fhat is Michelin's entire game. Delay. Mislead.\n\nObfuscate. Prevent trials on the merits. We ask that the Honorable Court to not allow it.\n\nConclusion: A year later, not11ing has changed. Just like in .Bates, Michelin still has the same\n\nstrategy: delay.     Plagued with infections and bed sores, the quadriplegic Obdulia's daily\n\nexistence is a struggle. ()bdu!ia is out oftiine.\n\n       Also, with loon1ing pretrial deadlines including expe1i disclosures, disclosure 1nust be\n\nmade. Michelin will use its lack of production to file sumn1ary judg1nc11ts, ]Jaubert n1otions and\n\nfurther clain1 that Plaintiffs' experts do not have foundation for their opinions. 1.''his is the best\n\nevidence that such absconded evidence is needed for Plaintiffs to fairly adjudicate their claims.\n\nAll extre1nely   pr~judicial   and unfair to the innocent Plaintiffs and their fmnily. It is tin1e f(ll\n\nMichelin to face the music and respond to Plaintiffs' requests for production so Plaintiffs can -\n\npursuant to the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure ~ \"obtain the fullest li:nowlcdgc of the facts and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    12\n\n\n                                                                                                    MR 0445\n\fissues prior to trial.\" Jn re E:xn1ark M.fi;.

The failed tire caused the vehicle to go out of control and roll\n 5 over. Kimberly was trapped in the vehicle for close to an hour, hanging from her seatbelt while the\n\n 6 emergency responders atte1npted to extract her. Kimberly suffered severe injuries to her leg/ankle as\n 7 well as to her ann. It took many surgeries and months of recovery before Kimberly was on her feet\n 8 again, and tl1e job she was excited about starting was no longer available.\n 9            The tire at issue is a P215/70R15 Uniroyal Tiger Paw AWP 1I tire, manufaetured at MNA's\n10 Ardmore, Oklahoma plant (\"The Subject Tire\").

See e.g., Sanction Order in Bates v. MNA, attached as\n      Exhibit B; see also Sanction Order in (}uzn1an v. MNA, attached as Exhibit C. In the Joint Report filed\n      almost a year ago, Plaintiff addressed this concern: \"In tl1e past, the Plaintiff's attorneys had a difficult\n1S time obtaining timely, complete, and accurate responses to tl1eir discovery requests from defendant\n17 Michelin North America.\" ,)\"ee June 13, 2014 Joint Report at p. 4.

Unfortunately, MNA did not live up to this promise.\n21 II.\n             MNA'S IMPROPER OBJECTIONS INCLUDING A VIOLATION OF THIS COURT'S\n22           ORDER REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF FACT WITNESSES.\n             On October 31, 2014, Ms. Allen served MNA with one set of Inte1Togatories (\"NU Is\") and one\n23\n      set of Requests for Production C'RFP\"). On December 12, 2014, Plainti'ffreceived MNA's responses,\n24\n      which stated: \"MNA objects to the extent this Interrogatory seeks or attempts to seek trade secret,\n25\n      proprietary, or othenvise co1nmercially confidential.\" S\"ee MNA 's Responses to NU Is at p. 3, Ex hi bi I\n26\n      D. MNA 1nade this objection despite the fact that the Court had entered a PO with a Heightened\n27\n      Confidentiality Clause, \\Vhich protects all of MNA's confidential docu1nents.

With this PO, MNA has no excuse for its failure to answer discovery.\n                  3           MNA also took it upon itself to edit Plaintiffs request and restricted its answers to: \"the\n                  4 Subject Tire and tires manufactured to the specification in place for the Subject Tire at the Ardmore,\n\n                  5 Oklahoma plant during the six rnonths before and the sjx 1nonths after the date. of 111anufucturc of the\n                  6 Subject Tire.\" See j(f. at p. 2, Exhibit D. By this means, MNA decided it would create its own\n\n                  7 discovery rules and defined this as ~'the Relevant Scope.\" Then, MNA refused to ans\\.ver discovery that\n                  8 did not fall within this self-defined \"relevant scope.\" For example, many of Ms. Allen's requests relate\n                 9    to MN A's notice of other incident or clailns in which consumers alleged tread separations or other\n                10 defects involving the same model tire. Other requests involve testing performed by or on behalf of'\nw\n~~              11 MNA that does not relate specifically to any one model tire, but instead relates to MN A's knowledge\ng.~.,,          12\nCJ)   enc.,.,         regarding the cause of tread separations. MNA failed to answer any of these requests.\n0 .p!;; !;;\n    i\"\" :6 13\no6 ~ ~     N            ivfNA also made numerous objections which have no support under Arizona law. For example,\nt!1 e \"\":::.\n~Et!~\nw   . . :i ~ 14 M'NA refused to identify anyone with knowledge about the design or manufacture of the subject tire\n\"\"~\nc_, w        15\n0 :g            clai1ning it did not have to answer interrogatories until the fact witness deadline. See MN A's\n(!l ~\n                1 6 supplemental responses to NU! 3, 4, 6 and 11, attached as Exhibit E.\n                17           Not only docs Rule 26. 1 require that MNA provide fact witness information in its lnitinl\n                1 8 Disclosure, but Plaintiff also specifically requested this information in an interrogatory.\n                19           Moreover, the Court's Scheduling Order instn1cted: \"This order does not replace the parties'\n                20 obligation to seasonably disclose Rule 26.l information on an on-going basis and as it becomes\n                21 available.\" See Dcce1nber 4, 2014 Scheduling Order. MNA's refhsal to identify lay witnesses is n\n                22 direct violation of this Court's order and alone is grounds for sanctions. By MNA's refusal to identiry\n                23 any witnesses until the fact witness deadline {April 27, 2015), MNA leaves Plaintiff only t\\vo months\n                2 4 (June 26, 2015) to depose these out of state individuals.\n                25           MNA also refused to answer interrogatories stating that Ms. Allen is required to subpoena n\n                2 6 30{b)(6) witness if she wanted responses. This has no support under Arizona law, and actually negates\n                2 7 the entire purpose of serving inten·ogatories.\n                28           One of the MNA's 1no:-;t confusing objections can be found in MNA's objections to Plaintiff's\n                                                                         4\n                                                                                                                  MR 0464\n\f                1 NUl' s 3) 5 and 6, Exhibit D. In each of these responses, MNA stated it would not answer the request\n                             1\n\n\n                2 because \"Plaintiff has not alleged a specific theory of defect in this case, nor is it clear what aspect o\n\n               3 the design and manufacturing process Plaintiff alleges to have been improper.\" Id. MNA's objection\n               4 fails to recognize that Plaintiff sent MNA a correspondence detailing Plaintiffs defect claims.

This \"meet and confer\" was between Plaintiffs counsel and\n 8\n     MNA's discovery counsel, which is now the third law firm currently representing MNA in this\n 9\n     lawsuit. MNA is currently represented by Farhang & Medcoff from Arizona, Yukevich Cavanaugh\n10\n     from Los Angeles, CA, and now Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP from South Carolina.\n11\n             During the meet and conferi Plaintiff provided her proposal regarding the scope of discovery.\n     See Feb1uary 12, 2015 email to MNA coun.o:;el, attached as Exhibit K. MNA responded with its O\\Vn\n     proposal. This Proposal required Ms. Allen to waive her right to seek court intervention to all of her\n     issues regarding MNA_'s discovery responses as a condition precedent to receiving only a few\n     additional responses from MNA.             See February 20, 2015 email from Giles Schanen, attached as\n16\n     Exhibit L:\" MNA will agree to provide the above information and documents only if doing so 'vill\n17\n     resolve all issues   \\Vi th   regard to plaintifPs discovery requests, and if plaintiff 'viii agree to tOrego\n18\n     a request for a plant inspection.\" Id.\n19\n            For the tire testing information Ms. Allen requested, MNA has made no offer to expand the\n20\n     scope of discovery in tenns of the types of tires even thot1gh many of the requests seek information\n21\n     about MN A's knowledge of tread separation causes and testing, which is not specific to a single tire.\n22\n            MNA's offer to supple1nent was still excessively restrictive and still failed to comply with\n23\n     Arizona's discovery rules. Ms. Allen was required inake this agreement before even having the chance\n24\n     to review the docu1nents MNA intended to disclose. What is tnore, Ms. Allen would have to withdra\\v\n25\n     t1vcnt-v of her requests in exchange for MNA expanding its \"Relevant Scope\" to three years rather\n26\n     than one, when even three years is too limited under Alizona law.

Plaintiff explained that the proper procedure for discovery is \"for Michelin to disclose\n                  6   the information, allow for the Plaintiff to examine it, and then if there are further issues, have\n\n                  7   the Court determine the narrow issues on \\Vhich \\Ve cannot agree.''

For example, the Corporate witness MNA identified in this case l1as recently avowed\n 4 that: \"Michelin requires that its tire designs also meet additional test requirements, including tread\n 5 wear testing~ traction testing, handling testing, and high speed testing.\" See Charles Patrick Affidavit\n 6 at p.4, para. 7, attached as Exhibit Q. Mr. Patrick also confirmed that MNA \"requires that its tires\n 7 designs undergo finite ele1nent analysis.\" See id. at para. 8. However, MNA has failed to produce any\n 8 testing or finite ele1nent analysis relevant to this tire. These are items that should have been included in\n\n 9 the Initial Disclosure Statement.\n10\n     v.      UNDER ARIZONA LAW, THE DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION REQUESTED\n11           ARE DISCOVERABLE.\n             Ariz.R.Civ.P. 1 instructs that the Rules \"sl1all be construed to secure the just, speedy) and\n     inexpensive dete1mination of every action.\" Id.

Ilowever, MNA did not begin manufacturing the subject tire until August\n  4 2007, meaning MNA actually limited the scope of discovery to only 8 or 9 months. This scope is too\n\n  5 restrictive for purposes of admissibility at trial, much less discovery.\n  6           MNA may not create its own definition of relevance that fits within its theory of the case,\n\n  7 especially when relevance has already been defined by our courts.

The tire that failed was on the rear of the family's vehicle. The forces exerted on the\n\n            10    vehicle from the separation caused a loss of control and led to the vehicle's rolling over down an\n            11    embankment on the 5 freeway. Carlos's wife Sylvia and his daughter Elena were killed in the\n\n            12    crash. The tire at issue is a P245/75 R 16 Long Trail TIA model tire manufactured at Michelin's\n            13    Ardmore plant during the 481h week of 1998. The discovery at issue in this motion specifically\n            14    relates to MNA's notice of lawsuits for personal injury and wrongful death or property damage\n\n            15    claims in which consumers alleged a tread separation incident involving the exact same size and\n            16    model tire.\n            17                   Defendant MNA has unnecessarily· delayed providing appropriate responses to\n            18    simple, yet important, discovery requests. Although Plaintiffs' counsel has repeatedly attempted\n\n            19    to meet and confer about certain deficient responses, the meet-and-confer process has been\n            20    unproductive. SpecificaJly, Defendant has failed to provide a fu1I and complete response to\n\n            21    Request for Production No. 18 (which is the sole issue of this Motion), which was served on\n\n            22    MNA on August 13, 2009.     \"fhis request, which is crucial to this case seeks the following\n\n            23    materials:\n\n            24                  REQUEST NO. 18\n            25                          All DOCUMENTS or WRITINGS relating or referring to\n            26                  any report of a full or partial tread separation of a Uniroyal Laredo\n\n            27                  tire or any SIMILAR PRODUCT which was manufactured between\n            28                   1996 and 2005 that YOU have received, including but not limited to\n\n\ntA16. 387                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n                                                                                                             MR 0486\n\f            1\n                                lawsuits for personal injury or wrongful death, or property damage\n\n            2\n                                 claims, or correspondence.

The entirety of the documents (4 pages) produced by MNA in its initial response is\n\n           10   attached to the Declaration of Christine D. Spagnoli as Exhibit 1. Michelin also attempted to\n\n           11   unilaterally limit the scope of the request to tires manufactured within the 6 months before and the\n\n           12   6 months after the subject tire (basically June 1998 to J uue 1999). Immediately after the initial\n\n           13   responses were received, Plaintiffs' counsel sent a meet-and-confer letter pointing out the obvious\n\n           14   deficiencies in the responses, and asking for a supplemental response. MNA's counsel agreed to\n\n           15   supplement the responses by January 15, 2010. As that date approached, MNA's counsel asked\n\n           16   for additional time, and promised that supplement responses would be provided.\n\n           17                   In the face of these delays, Plaintiffs' counsel continued to press MNA's counsel\n\n           18   for production of the non-privileged records concerning these other incidents, as well as further\n\n           19   expansion of the scope to include other similarly designed tires. In the meantime, Plaintiffs'\n\n           20   counsel served additional discovery to determine what, if any, information MNA hiid in its\n\n           21   possession about these other tires and whether it even had the failed tires available for inspection\n\n           22   by plaintiffs's experts. As a result of these discovery efforts, it was ultimately determined that\n\n           23   MNA had, in fact, obtained possession of many of the failed tires which were the subject of claims\n\n           24   and lawsuits, had investigators inspect and photograph these tires, and then after resolving those\n\n           25   clai.ms, destroyed the tires.\n\n           26                   Finally, after Plaintiffs' counsel's continuing attempts to obtain further responses to\n\n           27   Request #18, on March 30, 2010, MNA produced an additional piece of paper on which it listed\n\n           28   the names of four additional lawsuits which purportedly stemmed from tread separations involving\n\n\n                                                                  -4-\n1A16.3B7                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n                                                                                                            MR 0487\n\f              1   the same mode] tire. This new piece of paper did not identify the tires invo1ved in the incidents.\n\n              2\n                  No other documentation of these incidents wa'> provided. The next day (March 31, 2010) at a\n\n              3   deposition of a representative of MN A regarding the design and manufacture of the subject model\n\n              4\n                  tire, MNA's counsel hand-wrote the DOT numbers for the tires involved in these additional four\n\n              5   incidents on MNA 4195.\n\n              6                   As a result, as of April 1, 2010, despite a delay of more 1han 8 mon1hs, MNA has\n\n              7   not produced a single document in its possession concerning any of the incidents identified on any\n\n              8   of the five pieces of paper identifying 119 consumer complaints and the 26 tread separation\n\n              9   property damage claims and lawsuits involving ofP245/75R 16 Longtrail TIA tires. MNA has\n\n            10    failed to explain the scope of its production, failed to produce documents about these incidents and\n\n            11    failed to provide mandatory statements of compliance explaining its lack of production. These\n\n            ·12   inadequate responses are adverse1y prejudicing P1aintiffs' counsel's trial preparation, are required\n\n            13    by law, and as a consequence, the Court must grant this Motion and impose monetary sanctions so\n\n            14    that Plaintiffs can obtain complete discovery responses.\n\n            15\n\n            16                                                       II.\n\n            17                         STATEMENT O~' FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n            18                   On August 13, 2009, Plaintiffs sent a Request for Production of Documents, Set\n\n            19    One, to MNA. (See Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One, attached as Exhibit\n\n            20    2to1he Declaration of Christine D. Spagnoli.) As would be explained to MNA in Plaintiffs' meet-\n\n            21    and-confer letter and as set forth in P1aintiffs' concurrently filed Separate Statement of Discovery\n\n            22    in Dispute, these requests sought very specific documentary evidence concerning the design of the\n\n            23    Subject Mode] Tire and similar models as well as MNA's manufacturing processes and quality\n\n            24    contro1 practices. Since there are signs of both design and manufacturing defects in the Subject\n\n            25    Tire and such allegations form the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint, documentary evidence related to\n\n            26    the design of the Subject Model Tire and evidence related to the quality control and manufacturing\n\n            27    practices at the Ardmore plant are highly relevant, indeed critical, to the central issues in this case.\n\n            28\n\n                                                                    -5-\nlA.16.387                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FQR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0488\n\f             1                      MNA served responses on September 14, 2009, indicating it would produce\n\n             2\n                 confidential materia1 only upon the entry of a suitable protective order. (See Responses to\n\n             3   Plaintiffs Request for Production of Documents, Set One, attached as Exhibit 3 to the Declaration\n\n             4\n                 of Christine D. Spagnoli.) Plaintiffs then sent their lengthy meet-and-confer letter, including the\n\n             5   proposition that the parties simply agree to an Order previously agreed to by MNA in another case.\n\n             6   (See Meet-and-Confer letter dated September 24, 2009, attached as Exhibit 4 to the Declaration of\n\n             7   Christine D.

On\n\n            10   December 8, 2009, Plaintiffs' counsel sent yet another meet-and-confer letter, which indicated that\n\n            11   MNA's responses were still inadequate. (See Meet-and-Confer letter dated December·S, 2009,\n\n            12   attached as Exhibit 5 to the Declaration Of Christine D. Spagnoli.) Specifically, the December 8th\n\n            13   letter addressed Request Number 18 (which is the sole subject of this Motion); this section of the\n\n            14   letter provided:\n\n            15             In order to fully comply with this request, MNA must produce a complete list\n\n            16              ofall claims and lawsuits/or the subject model tire, regardless ofwhen the\n\n            17              incidents occurred, and including the date MNA received notice ofthe\n\n            18              incident. MNA also must provide a complete record ofchanges made to the\n\n            19             subject model tire, before and after it was manufactured, so that we can\n\n            20             evaluate whether the limitation to one year post manufacture as a \"relevant\n\n            21             scope\" is appropriate. Finally, MNA must. produce all of the foandational,\n\n            22             non-privileged materials related to these claims and lawsaits, such as\n\n            23             trafflC collision reports and photographs, and provide a privilege log for\n\n            24             any privileged materials that are being withheld, such as notes of\n\n            25             inspections of the tires by MNA consultants or investigators.

(See, e.g. Ault v. International Harvester Co.

The defendant contended that the plaintif\n\n            12    had not established a substantial similarity between the other two accidents and the circumstances o\n\n            13    the case at issue. But the court concluded that this did not preclude the admission of the evidence\n\n            14    because: \"The focus was not on accidents themselves hut upon the inherent similarity in the\n\n            15    physical andmechanical properties of the three gear boxes, all of which purportedly contained\n\n            16    similar defects.\" (Id. at 122 (emphasis added).)\n\n            17                    Similarly, in Elsworth v. Beech Aircraft Corp. (1984) 37 Cal.3d 540, 555, the\n\n            18    California Supreme Court held that admission of evidence of20 other accidents, including 15\n\n            19    involving a different model airplane, was proper. According to the court: \"Evidence of the\n\n            20    similarity in the design of the Baron and the '!'ravel Air was sufficient to justify the court1s\n\n            21    conclusion that evidence regarding accidents in the Baron was admissible.\" (Ibid.)\n\n            22                   In Hasson v.

In allowing the evidence to be admitted, the California\n\n            25    Supreme Court wrote: \"The trial court plainly had a reasonable basis for admitting evidence of the\n\n            26    numerous failures occurring in 1965 models for the purpose of showing the nearly identical 1966\n\n            .27\n                  models to be similarly defective.

This\n\n              2   detennination \"is primarily the function of the trial judge.\" (Hassan, supra, at 404 (emphasis\n\n              3   added).)\n\n              4                    It is also well-established that evidence of other incidents is also admissible to prove\n\n              5   notice provided that the circumstances of the other incidents are similar and not too remote.\n\n              6   (Aguayo v.

Indeed, where it concerns the issue of notice, the admissibility\n\n              8   of evidence of oilier incidents has been characterized as ~'quite broad.\" (Davies v. Superior Court\n\n              9   (1984) 36 Cal.3d 291, 299.) According to the court in Elsworth: \"Even ifthe accidents did not\n\n             10   occur in precisely the same manner as in the present case, testimony regarding the accidents that\n\n             11   occurred prior to the crash ... was admissible to show that [the defendant] had notice of a dangerou\n\n             12   condition. For this purpose, 'all that is required .•• is that the previous injury should be such\n\n             13   as to attract the defendant's attention to the dangerous situation.'\" (37 Cal. 3d at 555 (emphasis\n\n             14   added).)\n\n             15              In llasson, supra, the California Supreme Court held that evidence, including letters and\n\n             16   testimony of brake failures in other vehicle models, was admissible to establish notice of a defect in\n\n             17   a specific vehicle, The court stated that: \"When evidence is offered to show only that defendant\n\n             18   had notice of a dangerous condition, the requirement of similarity of circumstances is\n\n             19   relaxed.\" (32 Cal.3d at 404.) In fact, in Brake v. Beech Aircraft Corp. (1986) 184 Cal. App.3d 930,\n\n             20   937-38, the Court stated that prior accidents were admissible to prove notice by the defendarits eve\n\n             21   though the plaintiff had failed to lay the foundation for similarity for flight altitude, trim settings,\n\n             22   engine power, loading, weather conditions, altitudes, feathering etc.\n\n             23              The law clearly allows the discovery of the foundational facts concerning other incidents\n\n             24   involving the same product, and it incumbent on the defendant to produce the infonnation that it has\n\n             25   in its possession. l'his is especially true in thls case because it can be expected that MNA will\n\n             26   attempt to challenge the admissibility of evidence concerning these other incidents as it did in\n\n             27   Stephen v.

(See Reedy v. Bussell (2007) 148 Cal. App.4th 1272,1291;\n            9\n                Ghanooni v. Super Shuttle (1993) 20 Cal.App.4th 256, 260.) That requirement was dropped from\n           10\n                Code of Civil Procedure section 2023, subdivision (b), as part of the Civil Discovery Act of 1986.\n           11\n                (Kohan v.

Indeed, the Reedy case is instructive because it\n           12\n                indicates that courts can construe the willful misconduct and violations of court orders from repeate\n           13\n                failures to respond and the use of objections and other tactics to delay production until motions are\n           14\n                filed.

For example,\n           17\n                in Sherman v. Kinetic Concepts (1998) 67 Cal. App. 4\" 1152, concealment of evidenced concerning\n           18\n                other i!1cidents involving an allegedly defective product led to a new trial after the plaintiffs\n           19\n                discovered that a number of such incidents had not been disclosed in discovery. As the court\n           20\n                explained: !(throughout the litigation, KCI failed to produce and concealed     t~e   existence of crucial\n           21\n                documents relating to material issues in the Shermans' lawsuit.

Nearly two years after plaintiff's initia1 discovery request, a discovery referee found that\n\n            5   \"Bentley failed to timely produce relevant and properly demanded, but potentially damaging,\n\n            6   documents.\" (Id at 977.)

Michelin\n\nDear Chris:\n\n       Your last two (2) letters are a misrepresentation of what has happened\nconce1ning production of docu1nents and are outright inaccurate. Moreover,\nconcerning your third letter, for all intents and purposes, I stick by it. However, other\nadjectives whicl1 also accurately characterize Michelin's prior actions and recent\nproposal include: dishonest, deceptive and misleading.              Michelin's lack of\nconsideration for the numerous innocent victims such as Obdulia Medina, Sandra Velo\nand many, many others throughout the years caused by its shoddy and defective tires -\ncoupled with its lack of disclosure about it··· demonstrates a corporate culture 1hat has\nno place in our modern society.\n\n       Yours/Michelin's request that Plaintiffs \"identify codes\" reveals Michelin's\nbad faith discovery tactics since Michelin still has not produced 1he Code Sheets for\nAdjustment Data including but not limited to \"List of Objective or Subjective\nDamages: Expert Codification.\" 1bus, Michcli11's most recent \"proposal\" is more of\n1hc same: intentional refusal to produce discoverable evidence.\n\n        Finally, yo·ur statement that we have refused to 1neet and confer is inaccurate,\nand you know it. Regardless of what you write, we bo1h know we have had multiple\nand sundry conversations with Michelin's counsel about production since May of\n2015. Moreover, recently at 1he deposition of Adrian Rico and his family in Dallas,\nwe conferred wi1h you specifically about the documents. You told us that nei1hcr you\nnor 'I'om had authority to malce decisio11s, and we needed to \"negotiate discovery'i with\nMichelin because that was their \"process.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0504\n\fSeptember 2, 2015\nPage2\n\n\n       We told you that Michelin does not make the Rules. It is not the Michelin's\nRules of Civil Procedure, We further told you that Plaintiffs follow the Texas Rules of\nCivil Procedure. The same stands true today. Accordingly, yet again, we ask that\nMichelin follow the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and its discovery scope and\nproduce the documents previously requested.\n\n\n\n                                               Very truly yours,\n\n\n\n\nLPG/DCS/tk\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   MR 0505\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 1 of 61\n\n\n\n\n                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                      FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n                                ATLANTA DIVISION\n\nJOHNNY BATES and PATRICIA\nMIDDLETON BATES,\n\nPlaintiffs,                                                         CIVIL ACTION NO.\n                                                                    1:09-C'V-3280-AT\nv.\nMICHELIN NORTH AMERICA, INC.,\n\nDefendant.\n\nI.

This is the Plaintiffs' second Motion for Sanctions\n\narising ont of Defendant Michelin North America lnc.'s (\"Michelin\") violation of\n\nthe Court's multiple Orders requiring the production of certain documents.'\n\nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter an Order establishing issue preclusion as a\n\ndiseovery sanction - specifically, a determination that the subject tire was\n\n\n\n1 Plaintiffs dicl not request that the Court impose sanctions against Micl1elin's counsel because\n\nin Plaintiffs' view the conduct giving rise to the sanctions request is part of a larger pattern of\ndiscovery abuse and disregard for the legal process by Michelin. Michelin was initially\nrepresented only by Robert Monyak, Bo11nic Lassiter and Benjamin Chastain of Peters and\nMony<lk, LLP.       On April 5, 2010, Elizabeth C. \"IZate\" Ilelm, of Nelson Mullins, Riley &\nScarborough, IJ.•P entered an appearance on behalf of Michelin. (See Doc. 27.) Ms. Helm is\nMicl1elin's national discovery counsel. As a result of her participation on 'behalf of Michelin in\ntl1e discovery process, Ms. I-Ielm ultimately became a material witness on the sartctions issue.\nThus, after Plaintiffs made their secortd request for sanctions, Richard I(. Hines of Nelson\nMullins, Riley & Scarborough, LLP and Susan A. Cahoort of I<ilpatrick Townsend & Stockton,\nI..I.,P-GA entered appearances on behalf of Michelin.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0507\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 3 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous and that the subject tire failed as a result\n\nof its defective and unreasonably dangerous condition.\n\n      Viewed in isolation, Michelin's failure to produce certain documents in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' discovery requests and this Court's Orders could be seen as\n\nlegitimate mistakes and misunderstandings.             However, Plaintiffs have\n\ndemonstrated that Michelin has engaged in a pattern of subterfuge and\n\nwithholding relevant and responsive documents until Plaintiffs are forced to seek\n\nthe Court's intervention. In light of this pattern of prejudicial discovery abuse by\n\nMichelin throughout the course of the litigation, the Court finds that Michelin\n\nacted willfully in violating the Court's discovery Orders.      Therefore, a more\n\nsubstantive sanction than the previous monetary sanction imposed by the Court\n\nis warranted.\n\n      Accordingly, after careful consideration of the evidence and the record of\n\nthis case, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs'\n\nMotion for Sanctions as set forth below. Because the district court must clearly\n\nstate its reasons for imposing sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37\n\nto allow for meaningful appellate review, the Court provides a detailed discussion\n\nof the record as background and in its analysis.

Background of Previous Discovery Disputes\n\n        Plaintiffs brought this products liability and negligence action on\n\nNovember       23, 2009,    alleging a defect in a tire designed and manufactured by\n\nMichelin. 2     Plaintiffs served Michelin with their Requests for Production of\n\nDocmnents (\"RPDs\") on .January 15,             2010.    In addition to objecting to Plaintiffs'\n\nrequests as not being limited to the tire, plant, and time period relevant to this\n\naction, Michelin asserted a blanket objection that the requested docmnents\n\ncontained confidential trade secrets and were protected from disclosure.                           On\n\nApril   5, 2010,    the parties agreed upon a Stipulated Confidentiality Order to\n\ngovern the production and use of such documents which was entered by the\n\nCourt on April 7,      2010.    (See   Docs.   28, 29.)    Michelin produced documents on\n\nApril   23, 2010,   subject to the Stipulated Confidentiality Order. Michelin initially\n\nproduced a strikingly small number of documents in response to Plaintiffs'\n\ndiscovery requests.'         A dispute ensued between the parties over certain of\n\nPlaintiffs' RPDs, and Plaintiffs presented the dispute to the Court in the form of a\n\nletter-motion as instructed on November               HJ, 2010.

(See Pis.' Ex.\n\nB, Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g, (June 7, 2010 \"Meet and Confer\" Tr. 6:8-20);\n\nDec. 20, 2011 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 5-11, Doc. 104; Pis.' Reply Ex.

Hov.;ever, Michelin's representation is misleading. Plaintiffs only ultimately agreed\nto limit the scope of their requests after Michelin ol)jected that the requests were not limited in\nscope to the tire, plant, and time period relevant to this action and refused to produce\ndocuments on those grounds. Further, Plaintiffs clearly did not agree to this limited time frame\nin connection -with all of their Requests for Production.\n5\n   Michelin began designing the P235/70R15 Uniroyal I...aredo AWR ORVVL tire in October 1995.\n'fhe P235/70R15 Uniroyal Laredo AVVR ORWL tire was manufactured solely at the Ard1nore\nPlant.

(See Pis.' Reply Ex. B (November 10,\n\n2010   Letter to J. Story), Doc.     215-3.)   The Court heard argument on the Plaintiffs'\n\nrequest on December          20, 2010,    and on .January      3, 2011,   the Court entered an\n\nOrder compelling Michelin to produce nearly aU of the documents sought by\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n        A.      Plaintiffs' RPD 37 for Adjustment Data\n\n        Plaintiffs' RPD 37 (which was the subject of Plaintiffs' first request for\n\nsanctions and remains a subject of Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions) asks\n\nMichelin to:\n\n       Produce any documents containing, discussing or summarizing by\n       calendar year tire aqjustment or exchange data for the Uniroyal\n       Laredo series of tires, any tires with the same or similar\n       specifications as that series regardless of name or branding, or any\n       tire made from the same or similar \"green\" tire as that used in that\n       series for tires manufactured at the Ardmore, Oklahoma, [sic] facility\n       as compared to other manufacturing facilities of defendants.\n\nIn response to Plaintiffs' request for adjustment6 data, Michelin initially\n\nproduced a chart. summarizing by month (from 1998 to                 2001)   the number of tires\n\nproduced and the total number of tires returned for tread belt separation - the\n\nalleged condition at issue.7 Plaintiffs objected to the creation of the chart for\n\n\n6\n  \"Adjustment\" is the term Michelin uses to describe the process of issuing credits or payments\nto consumers or dealers \\Vhen its tires arc returned fOr alleged defects and failure.<;. Plaintiffs'\ndiscovery requests seek internal information pos.\".lessed by Michelin regarding how it \"adjusts\"\ncredits for tire.<> returned ±Or alleged defects and failures.\n7\n  Prior to production of the doGument\".l, the parties agreed, at least initially, to narrow the scope\nof the request to cover only the alleged defective conditio11 at issue in this case ~ tread belt\nseparation. At the discovery hearing, the Court recognized that a variety of adjustment codes\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0511\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 7 of 61\n\n\n\n\npurposes of the litigation without the production of accompanying information\n\nthat was used to create the chart.             Plaintiffs argued to the Court that the\n\ninformation provided by Michelin was useless without the raw data, the codes,\n\nand the accompanying documents about how the data is collected, tabulated, and\n\nanalyzed. In addition, Plaintiffs requested that Michelin be compelled to produce\n\nthe internal manuals that Michelin uses for classifying the various types of\n\nmanufacturing and design conditions for which tires are returned. Plaintiffs also\n\nrequested documents used to interpret the adjustment data in order to determine\n\nwhether additional codes may cover the alleged tread belt separation condition at\n\nissue. (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 17-18, Doc. 104.)\n\n       The Court addressed Plaintiffs' request for these documents at the\n\nDecember 20, 2010 discovery hearing specifically as follows:\n\n       The Court: [M]y concern is if they are input by a code and there's no\n       other information other than entry of a code ... if [Michelin] would\n       provide the list of codes and what those codes represent so that if\n       [Plaintiffs] wanted to ask for additional codes to be checked, you\n       could do that, fearing that tread separation covers more than one\n       code and it may not have been covered, because what I understand is\n       if you push in ... the code for tread separation, it will tell you how\n       many there were, but it doesn't tell you specifics. It's just that this\n       tire, tl1is date, tread separation; but there's not a picture, there's not\n       an analysis beyond someone having categorized it as tread\n       separation.\n\n(Id. at 57-58.) On January 3, 2011, the Court ordered that\n\n\n1night potentially be relevant to the tread l)elt separation condition. (See Dec.   20i 2010   Disc.\nHr'g Tr. 57-58) Doc. 104.)\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0512\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 8 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      RPD 37: Defendant shall provide to Plaintiff the codes that are\n      used for identifying the causes for adjustment. As for any\n      adjustment identified in association with components and processes\n      at issue in this case, Defendant shall provide all data availahle to it\n      concerning that adjustment, including the date the tire was\n      returned, the age of the tire, the mileage, etc.\n\n(Doc. 90 at 5.) Accordingly, the Court ordered production of the documents as a\n\ntwo step process. First, Michelin was required to \"provide to Plaintiff[s] the\n\ncodes that are used for identifying the causes for adjustment,\" such that Plaintiffs\n\ncould identify which codes and conditions are potentially relevant to the alleged\n\ndefect at issue in this case. (Id.) Second, with respect to any adjustment codes\n\nidentified hy Plaintiffs as heing at issue, Michelin was required to \"provide all\n\ndata available to it concerning that adjustment, including the date the tire was\n\nreturned, the age of the tire, the mileage, etc.\" (Jd.)\n\n      B.     Michelin's Motion for Reconsideration Regarding\n             Adjustment Codes\n\n      Michelin sought reconsideration of the Court's January 3rd Order only so\n\nfar as it compelled production of adjustment code data in response to RPD 37\n\ncontending that the information contains trade secrets. Consequently, Michelin\n\ndid not produce the adjustment codes as ordered on January 3, 2011. On April\n\n28, 2011, the Court denied Michelin's motion for reconsideration on the gronnds\n\nthat (1) the trade secret issne was discussed and considered by the Court at the\n\nDecember 20th hearing and (2) Michelin offered no reason or change in law\n\nwarranting reconsideration of the Court's prior ruling compelling production of\n\n\n                                           7\n\n                                                                                 MR 0513\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 9 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthe adjustment data. (See Doc. 123.) In fact, at the December 20th hearing the\n\nCourt rejeded Michelin's trade secrets objection stating that documents could be\n\nproduced in accordance with the terms of the parties' Stipulated Confidentiality\n\nOrder and that counsel would be cxpeded to abide by the terms of that Order as\n\napproved and entered by the Court. (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 8:9-13, Doc.\n\n104.)\n\n        C.    Michelin's Failure to Produce Adjustment Codes and\n              Supporting Data\n\n        After its motion for reconsideration was denied on April 28, 2011, Michelin\n\nagain did not produce the adjustment data as ordered by the Court. Rather,\n\nMichelin informed Plaintiffs two weeks later, on May 12, 2011, that it no longer\n\nagreed that Plaintiffs' expert could receive or maintain copies of the documents,\n\nas contemplated by the Stipulated Confidentiality Order, due to Michelin's\n\nconcerns regarding the expert's protection of the confidential nature of the\n\ndocuments. Michelin unilaterally determined it could defer compliance with the\n\nCourt's Order requiring production of the documents after reconsideration was\n\ndenied and refused to produce the documents unless Plaintiffs agreed to modify\n\nthe terms of the Stipulated Confidentiality Order previously entered by the Court.\n\nOn May 13, 2011, Plaintiffs insisted that Michelin immediately comply with the\n\nCourt's Order compelling production of the documents and notified Michelin that\n\nthey would seek sanctions if the documents were not produced.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\n\n                                                                                MR 0514\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 10 of 61\n\n\n\n\n        D.      Plaintiffs First Request for Sanctions\n\n        Plaintiffs made their request for sanctions on May 19,               2011,   after Michelin\n\nfailed to produce the adjustment codes and data under the current terms of the\n\nparties' Stipulated Confidentiality Order. Plaintiffs asked the Court to impose\n\nissue preclusion sanctions upon Michelin for its failure to produce the\n\nadjustment code data ordered by the Court.                     On May      20, 2011,     only after\n\nPlaintiffs made their request for sanctions, Michelin produced a list of conditions\n\nidentifying, by name only, the causes for adjustment, but not the numeric codes\n\nfor the adjustments. (Pis.' Reply Ex. E, Doc. 215-6.)\n\n               1.      .June 3,    2011   Hearing\n\n        The Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' request for sanctions on ,Tune 3,\n\n2011.   At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for Michelin informed the Court\n\nthat the adjustment code data had been produced and that the parties had\n\nreached an agreement allowing Plaintiffs to provide the documents to their\n\nexpert. (June 3,      2011   Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 16:18-17:13, Doc. 169.) Based on these\n\ncircumstances, Michelin argued that Plaintiffs' continued request for sanctions at\n\nthe hearing was premature and improper without a \"meet and confer\" session. 8\n\n(Id. at 17:17-19:6.) Nonetheless, the Court proceeded with the hearing based on\n\n8 At the hearing and again in the June 24, 2011 ()rdcr, the (;ourt rejected this argument and\nfound tl1at M.icl1elin was obligated to comply with the Court's January 3, 2011 Order com1)elling\nthe production of the documents and that no \"1ncct and t.'Onfer\" '\\\\'US requirc'<l prior to Plaintiffs\nseeking sanctions for Michelin's failure to fully comply with the Court's prior orders.

The Conrt fonnd that this issne\n\nwas the eontinnation of the same discovery dispnte addressed in its Order of\n\nApril 28, 2011, and .Jndge Story's Order of Jannary 3, 2011.          (Jnne 3, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 19:7-14, Doe. 169.)\n\n      Michelin's connsel repeatedly represented that the list of adjnstment\n\nconditions produced to Plaintiffs was \"how the conditions are maintained in the\n\nregular course of business.\"     (Id. at 36:17-18, 37:6-8, 58:14-22.)      However,\n\nMichelin's counsel subsequently admitted in response to the Court's question at\n\nthe hearing that there were numbers that corresponded with the conditions and\n\nthat Michelin (not she) redacted the code numbers from the document produced\n\nto Plaintiffs. (Id. at 40:7-41:4.) In addition, in response to further inquiry by the\n\nCourt, Michelin's counsel revealed that additional documents describing t11e\n\nadjustment conditions existed. Michelin maintained that it was not ordered to\n\nproduce such documents and that the Court's January 3rd Order required only\n\nproduction of the codes. (Id. at 43:8-17, 59:1-10.)\n\n      The Court found that Michelin's redaction of the codes from the list of\n\nadjustment conditions violated the express terms as well as intent of the .January\n\n\n                                         10\n\n\n                                                                                  MR 0516\n\f       Case 1 09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 12 of 61\n\n\n\n\n3rd Order and that the list of adjustment conditions alone did not provide a\n\nsufficient documentary hasis or description from which Plaintiffs could identify\n\nall codes that might he relevant to the alleged tire defect in this case. (Id. at 52:8-\n\n55:1; 62:23-64:7.) Therefore, the Court ordered Michelin to produce the numeric\n\ncodes hy June 8, 2011, and all availahle documentary information descrihing the\n\nnature and causes for each adjustment code hy June 13, 2011. At the conclusion\n\nof the hearing, the Court warned Michelin that \"any further delays, manipulation\n\nof discovery ... or hasically failure to function in good faith in producing fully all\n\ninformation requested or ordered ... will result in a suhstantive sanction ...\n\ncomparahle to what Plaintiffs have asked the next time it comes in front of [the\n\nCourt].\" (Id. at 65:15-66:4.) The Court also cautioned Michelin's counsel ahout\n\nher client's hairsplitting, narrow constrnction of the Court's January 3, 2011\n\nOrder stating 'Tm not going to waste our time for us to go through another\n\nconference where you argue ahout ... what's really intended.\" (ld. at 54:15-25,\n\n63:20-64:7.)\n\n               2.   June 24,   2011   Order on Sanctions\n\n      On June 24, 2011, the Court issued a written Order on Plaintiffs first\n\nrequest for sanctions. (See Doc. 173.) The Court found sanctions were warranted\n\nhased on Michelin's failure to fully and timely comply with the Court's discovery\n\nOrders hut declined to impose issue preclusion sanctions. The Court instead\n\nawarded Plaintiffs attorney's fees incurred in connection with their request for\n\n\n                                          11\n\n\n\n                                                                                    MR 0517\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 13 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions and ordered Michelin to produce additional documents in response to\n\nPlaintiffs' discovery request for adjustment data. (Id.) The Court reiterated its\n\nfinding at the hearing that Michelin's extremely limited production \"essentially\n\nside-stepped by its narrow parsing and production response an essential purpose\n\nof the Court's original January 3,   2011,   discovery order regarding production of\n\nthe adjustment code data and information.\" (Id. at lo.) With respect to any\n\nadditional relevant adjustment codes identified by Plaintiffs, Michelin was\n\nordered to produce all tire data and documents available to it conceming those\n\nadjustment codes, including the internal manuals Michelin nses for classifying or\n\ndiscussing the conditions and issues arising in connection with application of a\n\nspecific adjustment code. (Id. at   ll.)   Finally, the Conrt again cautioned Michelin\n\nthat \"any failure to respond fully in producing these documents and tire data may\n\nresult in the imposition of sanctions, including the Court's entry of default,\n\ndetermination of issue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issne, or other\n\nsanctions authorized by Fed.

Plaintiffs' Second Request for Sanctions\n\n      Just five days after the Court issued its written Order imposing sanctions,\n\nPlaintiffs made a second request for issue preclusion     sar1ctio11s 011 ~Tune   30,   2011,\n\nthat was supplemented in further submissions in connection with the Court's\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\n\n                                                                                          MR 0518\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 14 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions hearing condnctcd on September 19, 2011.9 (Docs. 180, 215, Hr'g Exs.\n\nA-X).     Plaintiffs' second sanctions reqnest is based on additional alleged\n\ndiscovery abuses by Michelin since the Court's June 3rd sanctions hearing.\n\nPlaintiffs seek the sanction of issue preclusion a' to the defectiveness of the tire\n\nbecause, at the time of their second sanctions request, Plaintiffs assert that: (1)\n\nMichelin had not produced all the adjustment codes as ordered by the Court on\n\nJune 3, 2011, and June 24, 2011, and, (2) Plaintiffs learned during the depositions\n\nof two Michelin employees that Michelin had withheld documents directly\n\nrelevant to the defect issue previously covered by the Court's Orders.\n\n        Plaintiffs corrtend that a finding that the tire at issue was defective is\n\nwarranted for several reasons. First, Michelin withheld numerous documents in\n\nviolation of Court Orders compelling their production. Second, Michelin made\n\nrepeated misrepresentations to the Court that all responsive documents had in\n\nfact been produced and thereby obstructed and altered the course of discovery.\n\nFinally, the Court's prior monetary sanction proved insufficient to ensure\n\ncompliance with the Court's Orders.\n\n        On the other hand, Michelin contends that Plaintiffs have fabricated a\n\ndiscovery dispute where none exists in order to avoid proving the merits of their\n\ncase. Michelin asse1ts that no responsive documents were withheld under its\n\n\n9\n The Court ordered that PlaintiftS' letter request for sanctions be filed as a formal motion on the\nCM/ECF system. (See Doc. 180.)\n\n\n                                                13\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0519\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 15 of 61\n\n\n\n\ninterpretation of Plaintiffs' discovery requests and the Court's Orders. To the\n\nextent any documents were withheld, Michelin contends it was the result of\n\nhuman error as opposed to any willful violation of the Court's Orders.           In\n\naddition, Michelin contends it never made any intentional misrepresentations to\n\nthe Court Finally, Michelin asserts that Plaintiffs have not heen prejudiced\n\nbecause it has now produced all the documents Plaintiffs requested, despite\n\nMichelin's belief that such production was not required, in a good faith effort to\n\nresolve a manufactured discovery dispute.\n\n      As Plaintiffs asserted in their second sanctions request, and more keenly\n\ndemonstrated at the second sanctions hearing and in response to Michelin's\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment, Michelin withheld nearly all probative\n\ndocuments for over one and a half years after Plaintiffs served their discovery\n\nrequests. These documents would likely never have emerged hut for Plaintiffs'\n\npersistene.c in seeking the Court's intervention. For the reasons set forth below,\n\nMichelin's serial abuses, misrepresentations, and willful violations of the Court's\n\ndiscovery Orders warrant substantive sanctions.\n\n      A.    Standard of Review\n\n      When a party fails to ohey a court order to provide discovery, the court is\n\nauthorized to sanction the party hy \"directing that the matters embraced in the\n\norder or other designated facts he taken as established for purposes of the action,\n\nas the prevailing party claims [or] prohibiting the disobedient party from\n\n\n                                        14\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0520\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 16 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsupporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing\n\ndesignated matters in evidence.\" See Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A)(i)&(ii). District\n\ncourts have broad discretion to fashion appropriate sanctions for violations of\n\ndiscovery orders. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de\n\nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 707 (1982); BankAtlantic v. Blythe Eastman Paine\n\nWebber, Inc., 12 F.3d 1045, 1048 (11th Cir. 1994). \"A primary aspect of that\n\ndiscretion is the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which\n\nabuses the judicial process.\" Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 2, 44-45 (1991).\n\n       However, this broad discretion is governed by the most fundamental due\n\nprocess safeguard of fairness. See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 707. To\n\nensure the provision of due process in the review of a sanctions request, a court.\n\nmust impose sanctions that are both \"just\" and \"specifically related to the\n\nparticular 'claim' which was at issue in the order to provide discove1y.\" Id. \"Due\n\nprocess requires that the party be given fair notice that its conduct may warrant\n\nsanctions and the reasons why.\" In re Sunshine Jr. Stores, 456 F.3d 1291, 1306\n\n(11th Cir. 2006). A party can he given notice from either tl1e court or from the\n\nparty seeking sanctions. Id. Moreover, a party's \"blatant disregard for the []\n\nCourt's orders is itself notice.\" Id.\n\n       Rule 37(b)(2) docs not require the court to make a finding of bad faith\n\nbefore it may impose sanctions for a party's failure to comply with a court order.\n\nDevaney v. Continental American Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1154, 1162 (11th Cir. 1993).\n\n\n                                        15\n\n\n                                                                               MR 0521\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 17 of 61\n\n\n\n\nAlthough not a necessary precursor for sanctions, had faith is a relevant factor in\n\ndetermining the magnitude of a sanction. Id. (noting Court's discussion of had\n\nfaith in Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 775 F.2d 1440 (11th Cir. 1985). \"A party\n\n... demonstrates had faith hy delaying or disrupting the litigation or hampering\n\nenforcement of a court order.\" Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d 1075, 1121 (11th Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n         B.   September i.9,    2011 Sanctions     Hearing\n\n      On September 19, 2011, the Court conducted a full day evidenliary hearing\n\non Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions. Extensive argument was heard and\n\nthe parties submitted additional exhibits including hundreds of pages of\n\ndocuments produced hy Michelin after Plaintiffs filed their second sanctions\n\nrequest. Michelin's national discovery counsel Ms. Helm took the stand as the\n\nsole witness at the hearing to testify in Michelin's defense and to accept personal\n\nresponsibility for all of the alleged discovery \"errors.\"\n\n      C.      Michelin's Post-Sanctions Production of Adjustment Data\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that Michelin's continued failure to produce the\n\nadjustment codes and adjustment data in violation of the Court's January :ird,\n\nJune 3rd, and June 24th Orders warrants issue preclusion sanctions. After\n\nPlaintiffs' first request for sanctions, the Court ordered Michelin to produce three\n\nthings: (1) a list of the numeric adjustment codes that correlate to the list of\n\nadjustment conditions produced on May 20, 2011; (2) documents containing\n\n\n                                          16\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0522\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 18 of 61\n\n\n\n\nexplanations and photographs of the adjustment codes and conditions; and (3)\n\nfor each adjustment code identified hy Plaintiffs, all availahle tire adjustment\n\ndata and the internal manuals Michelin uses for classifying or discussing the\n\nconditions and issues arising in connection with application of the specific\n\nadjustment codes. (See Doe. 173.)\n\n      As ordered, Michelin produced a list of the numeric adjustment codes on\n\nJune 6, 2011. On June 13, 2011, Michelin produced 313 pages of adjustment\n\nconditions with codes, pictures and descriptions in purported compliance with\n\nthe Court's Order.    At that time, Michelin informed Plaintiffs it had fully\n\ncomplied with the Court's orders to produce all the codes. Upon review of these\n\ndocuments however, Plaintiffs discovered there were discrepancies between the\n\nMay 20th list of adjustment conditions, the June 6th list of conditions with\n\nnumeric codes, and the June 13th production of the conditions with codes,\n\npictures and descriptions. Accordingly, Plaintiffs contend that Michelin failed to\n\nproduce all the codes as ordered hy the Court on January 3rd, June 3rd, and\n\nagain on June 24th.\n\n    The Court held a status conference on ,July 7, 2011, to determine whether\n\nMichelin was in fact ohligated to produce additional documents identified hy\n\nPlaintiffs in their second sanctions request. At the July ]th status conference\n\nMichelin vehemently denied that it had not produced all the adjustment codes,\n\ndespite the fact that Plaintiffs detailed the discrepancies in the two prior\n\n\n                                        17\n\n\n                                                                               MR 0523\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 19 of 61\n\n\n\n\nproductions. (July 7, 2011 Status Conf. Tr. 27, Doc. 183.) However, on July 14,\n\n2011, Miehelin produced another 144 pages of adjustment conditions with codes,\n\npicttrres, and descriptions. 10\n\n     Plaintiffs assert that Michelin wrongfully withheld the adjustment codes in\n\nviolation of the Court's ,June 24th sanctions Order. In its defense, Michelin\n\neontends that the incomplete production was the result of human error. At the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing, Ms. Helm testified that after receiving the\n\nadjustment conditions with codes, pictures and descriptions from Michelin to be\n\nproduced on June 13, 2011, she compared them to the June 6th list of adjustment\n\ncodes and conditions and noticed that the two did not match. (Helm Aff.                ~   56,\n\nDoc. 192-6; Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12, Doc. 230.) There\n\nwere codes on the June 6th list for which Michelin did not have additional\n\ndescriptions, and there were additional descriptions of conditions that were not\n\nlisted on the ,June 6th code list. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12,\n\nDoc. 230.)\n\n     Ms. Helm testified that she made several mistakes on June 13, 2011. (Id.)\n\nFirst, Ms. Helm made mistakes regarding which adjustment codes were missing\n\nin her June 13th transmittal letter to Plaintiffs when the additional descriptions\n\n\n\n10 Out of the 144 pages produced by Michelin on July 14i 2011, 113 new conditions with codes,\npictures and descriptions were produced that 11ad previously been -withheld (MNA 8436-8548)\nand 31 were duplicates of conditions that were produced on June 13, 2011 (MNA 8560-8590).\n\n\n                                             18\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0524\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 20 of 61\n\n\n\n\nwere produced.n (Helm Aff.           ~   58.) In her attempt to sort through the documents\n\nto compare them and determine the differences, Ms. Helm testified she\n\nsegregated out the documents for the conditions that were not on the June 6th\n\ncode list. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm\n\nfurther testified that when she compiled the documents to produce to Plaintiffs,\n\nthe documents for the conditions that were not on the June 6th list were\n\ninadvertently left out of the production. (Id.) According to Ms. Helm, she did not\n\ndiscover any of this until after Plaintiffs made their second request for sanctions.\n\n(ld.) Therefore, Michelin contends that it\" failure to produce all the codes as\n\nordered by the Court, the result of human error, amounts to excusable neglect\n\nthat does not warrant the imposition of the severe sanction requested by\n\nPlaintiffs. However, Plaintiffu contend that Michelin continued to produce the\n\nadjustment data documents in bad faith after the Court's June 3rd sanctions\n\nhearing.\n\n     At the September 19th hearing, Michelin requested that it not be sanctioned\n\nfor any misconduct, essentially asserting that it should be rewarded for counsel's\n\nself-corrective actions. In response to Plaintiffs' contention that Michelin failed\n\nto produce au the adjustment conditions with codes, descriptions, and pictures in\n\nbad faith, Michelin's counsel claimed that \"the only reason they knew of those\n\n\n11\n   Ms. Helm admitted these mista}{es during the July ?tl1 status conference, l)ut had not yet\ndiscovered her failure to produce all the codes as outlined in her July 14, 2011 lcttcr to Plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                                 19\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0525\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 21of61\n\n\n\n\nmissing items was that there was a self reporting.\"        (Id. at 89.)     Michelin\n\ncontended that the additional 144 pages were produced on its own initiative and\n\nnot becanse Plaintiffs had caught Michelin red-handed. (Id. at 145.) However,\n\nMichelin's alleged \"self reporting\" did not occnr until after Plaintiffs pointed ont\n\nthere were missing codes and sought sanctions for Michelin's withholding of the\n\ndocnments. Michelin did not simply discover the error on its own and voluntarily\n\ncome forward with the documents as it would have the Court believe. While this\n\nconduct alone would not warrant issue preclusion sanctions, the Court is\n\ndoubtful of whether Michelin would have discovered this oversight and\n\nvoluntarily produced the additional 113 adjustment codes that had previously\n\nbeen withheld in the absence of Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions.\n\n             1.    Michelin's multiple misrepresentations regarding\n                   adjustment codes aud conditions\n\n     Unfortunately, the veracity of Michelin's contentions regarding its conduct\n\nin the discovery process for a variety of reasons has proven unreliable. It appears\n\nPlaintiffs are correct in their assertion that every one of Michelin's counsel's\n\nrepresentations to the Court regarding the production of the adjustment codes\n\nand adjustment data has proven to be inaccurate.\n\n      First, as noted above, Ms. Helm told the Court at the June 3rd hearing that\n\nthe six-page list of adjustment conditions \"are the codes\" and that these are the\n\nway the codes are maintained \"in the regular course of business.\" (June 3,     2011\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0526\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 22 of 61\n\n\n\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 36:11-19, Doc. 169.)               However, when pressed, Ms. Helm\n\neventually admitted that the numeric codes had been redacted from this list but\n\nthat \"I didn't do it, Yonr Honor.\"u (Id. at 40:24-41'4.) She fnrther stated that\n\n\"[b]nt there's been no condition of a tire redacted from this list.\" (Id.) Then,\n\nmuch to the Court's surprise, at the September 19th Sanctions hearing, Ms. Helm\n\ndenied that Michelin redacted the codes and instead took personal responsibility\n\nfor the redactions' oeenrrenee.'3 (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 191:17-196:7,\n\nDoe. 230.) Ms. Helm was evasive in response to Plaintiffs' qnestioning of who\n\nredacted the list, stating repeatedly that she did not recall. (Id.) When asked\n\nwho provided her with the docnment that had been redacted, Ms. Helm again\n\ntestified she did not recall. (Id.) Ms. Helm fnrther testified at the September\n\n19th sanctions hearing that when she told the Conrt on ,June 3rd that the list\n\ncontained the adjustment codes as regnlarly maintained by Michelin, she in fact\n\nknew the codes had been ent off the side of the document. (Id.)\n\n       Ms. Helm admitted that \"we should have produced the codes with the\n\nnumbers.\" (Id.) When asked where was the mistake or human error in the\n\nredaction of the codes, Ms. Helm testified \"the mistake and human error was\n\n\n12 Michelin's redaction of the codes \\Vas 1he subject of the Court's June 24tlt Order on sanctions\nand does not form the basis for the Court'8 imposition of sanctio11s herein. IIowever, the\nredaction is relevant to the larger pattern of Michelin's abuse of the discovery process as further\ndcn1onstratcd by Michelin's counsel's subsequent evasive testimony regarding who actually\nmade the decision to redact the codes.\n13\n   It is clear tl1at Ms. Helm attem1)ted to take the blame for the redaction in order to protect\nMichelin from further sanctions.\n\n\n                                                21\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0527\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 23 of 61\n\n\n\n\nmaking the decision to redact the numbers off or to produce the document with\n\nthe numhers redacted off.\" (Id.) After repeated questions by Plaintiffs as to who\n\nmade that decision, Ms. Hehn stated she made the decision despite her previous\n\nrepresentation to the Court on June 3, that \"I didn't do it.\"'< (Id.) When asked\n\nwhether she spoke with anyone at Michelin about the decision, Ms. Helm further\n\nevaded the issue by responding she did not recall. (Id.)\n\n      In addition, Michelin's June 13th production of the conditions with codes,\n\npictures and descriptions revealed the falsity of its representations to the Court at\n\nthe June 3rd hearing that the redacted six-page list of adjustment conditions\n\nwere the codes and that this skeletal listing constituted the way the codes are kept\n\nin the regular course of business. Ms. Helm subsequently confirmed that the full\n\nproduction - including the codes, pictures and verbal descriptions of how to\n\nidentify the tire conditions represented by each code             are \"the documents used\n\nby the inspectors in the adjustment centers to evaluate and code returned tires.\"\n\n(Helm Aff.   ~   55, Doe. 192-6.)\n\n     Furthermore, Michelin's counsel represented to the Court at the June 3rd\n\nhearing that while the numeric codes may have been redacted, no adjustment\n\nconditions were redacted from the May 20th list of adjustment: conditions. (June\n\n3, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 40:24-41'4, Doc. 169.) This representation turned out\n\n\n14\n   Before taldng responsibility for the decisio11, Helrn attempted to assert the attorney-client\nprivilege. (Sept. 19, 2011Sanctions1-Ir'g 'fr. 195, Doc. 230.)\n\n\n                                              22\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0528\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 24 of 61\n\n\n\n\nto be only partially true. While certain conditions may not have been redacted\n\nfrom the list, Michelin now admits that 113 adjustment conditions were not\n\nincluded on the original list. (Helm Aff. iii! 56-59, Doc. 192-6; Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 171-176, Doc. 230.)\n\n    Although the Court originally believed Ms. Helm's affidavit testimony that\n\nthe failure to produce the missing adjustment codes was an innocent oversight,\n\nand while this may very well be true, tbc credibility of her statements over time\n\nhas been eroded by the actual course of discovery events. In light of Ms. Helm's\n\nevasive and inconsistent testimony at the September 19th hearing and Defendant\n\nMichelin's shifting representations made to the Court since ,June 3, 2011, the\n\nCourt cannot simply rely on Michelin's avowals of good faith regarding any of\n\nthese discovery issues.\n\n            2.     Michelin's failure to produce graphs and other\n                   interpretive adjustment data\n\n      In accordance with tbe Comt's two-step process for the production of the\n\nadjustment data, after Michelin produced all the codes that are used for\n\nidentifying the causes for adjustment and Plaintifts identified the additional\n\ncodes for which they sought adjustment data, Michelin was required to provide\n\nall data available to it concerning the identified aqjustment codes.

After Plaintiffs\n\nwere unable to make any sense of the information, they questioned Michelin's\n\nemployee-expert Mr. Charles Patrick, who regularly reviewed adjustment data,\n\nabout the chart. (Patrick Dep. 76-90, July 28, 2011.) Mr. Patrick testified he had\n\nnever seen the information in that format. (Id. at 76.) Mr. Patrick was unable to\n\ninterpret the chart during his deposition. (Id. at 84-90.) Indeed, Michelin's own\n\nemployee could not decipher the chart using the glossary created by Michelin to\n\ndecode the chart. (Id. at 90-95.)\n\n        The chart appears to contain information about the number of tires\n\nreturned under the relevant aqjustment codes identified by Michelin. At the\n\nSeptember 19, 2011 sanctions hearing, Plaintiffs maintained that Michelin was\n\nstill continuing to withhold internal documents necessary to analyze and explain\n\nthe data in the chart. Like the original list of adjustment conditions provided, the\n\nchart was a meaningless listing in and by itself, as demonstrated by Mr. Patrick's\n\ndeposition testimony. >s\n\n\n- - ----·----\n1\n ~ The chart does however highlight the importance for the numeric adjust1nent codes that were\noriginally redacted by Michelin. '.rhc chart references the numeric adjustment code only and not\nthe name of any of the conditio1is for which the tires were returned. Tl1e Court notes that at the\nJune 3rd hearing regarding production of the adjustment codes Michelin's Counsel stated\n\"what is important is not whetl1er we call it n11ml)er :t, it's \\vhether we cal1 it unsticldng or\nleaking at the joint.\" (,June,;, 2011 Sanctio11s Hr'g '.I'l'. 4:1:5-10, Doc. 169.) Yet, it is clear, that\nwithout the numeric codes, the subsequently prod11ced chart purportedly summarizing the\nadjustment data would have been even more incompreltensible.\n\n\n                                                  24\n\n                                                                                                      MR 0530\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 26 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      The ,July 19th chart of adjustment data does uot comply with the Court's\n\nJune 24th Order. The June 24th Order provided that:\n\n      With respect to each adjustment code identified by Plaiutiffs,\n      Micheliu shall provide to Plaintiffs all tire data aud documents\n      available to it couceruiug that adjustmeut. To eusure full compliauce\n      with this directive, the Court uotes that Micheliu should produce the\n      internal manuals it uses for classifyiug or discussiug the couditious\n      aud issues arisiug iu couuectiou with applicatiou of the specific\n      adjustment code.\n\n(Doc. 173 at 11.) Moreover, the Court warned Michelin tl1at \"any failure to\n\nrespond fully in producing these documents and tire data may result in the\n\nimposition of sanctions, including the Court's entry of default, determination of\n\nissue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issue, or other sanctions authorized\n\nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A).\" (Td.)\n\n      An essential purpose of the Order was to ensure that Plaintiffs were\n\nprovided the information necessary to analyze and evaluate the adjustment data\n\nto determine how many tires were being returned for the conditious at issue in\n\nthis case. Not only did Michelin produce the adjustment data in a format that\n\nwas indecipherable to Plaintiffs, not even a Michelin employee who was\n\nexperienced in analyzing adjustment data could understand the information\n\nprovided in the chart. Indeed, as Mr. Patrick admitted in his deposition, in order\n\nto understand the meaning of eve1y column and code in tl1e chart, he would need\n\nmore than just the glossary prepared by Michelin. (Patrick Dep. 95, July 28,\n\n2011.) In light of the Court's prior directives with respect to the adjustment codes\n\n\n                                         25\n\n                                                                                 MR 0531\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 27 of 61\n\n\n\n\nand data, Michelin's production of the adjustment data in this completely\n\nunusable format was patently unacceptable. Michelin's mode of production of\n\nthe chart is yet one more strand in its pattern of failing to produce meaningful\n\nresponses to Plaintiffs' discovery requests in violation of both the letter and spirit\n\nof the Court's Orders.\n\n      According to Mr. Patrick, Michelin itself actually did not nse the chart form\n\nthat was produced to Plaintiffs in this litigation bnt instead compiled its tire\n\nadjustment and retnrn data into graphs for comparison and analysis at quarterly\n\nmeetings. (Id. at 76.) As Mr. Patrick testified, these graphs compared the return\n\nrates of Laredo tires to other tire lines and to Michelin's overall rates. (fd. at 76,\n\n79, 112, 182-83.) No snch graphs were produced by Michelin in response to RPD\n\n37 requesting information summarizing Michelin's adjustment data.\n\n      At the sanctions hearing, Michelin contended that it did not keep these\n\ngraphs and that they were destroyed after their nse at these quarterly meetings.\n\nMs. Helm testified at the hearing that after Mr. Patrick's deposition, Michelin\n\nsearched for the graphs and determined that no snch graphs exist. (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 18s-86, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm further testified that the graphs\n\nwere created as demonstratives for the employee meetings and are not\n\nmaintained after the staff meetings. (Id. at 241.)\n\n      These graphs wonld obviously be highly probative of the issne of what\n\nMichelin knew ahont its tires' comparative failure rates, why certain tires were\n\n\n                                         26\n\n                                                                                   MR 0532\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 28 of 61\n\n\n\n\nfailing, and what changes in the design or manufacturing process may have been\n\ninitiated to prevent future failures.     As Mr. Patrick testified, by using this\n\ninformation Michelin could determine whether it was \"starting to see something\n\nnew when we put in high-tensile steel, I mean, are the tires lasting longer, does it\n\nlook like the wear rates are lasting longer, things like that.\" (Patrick Dep. 80,\n\n,July 28, 2011.) And indeed, Mr. Patrick as Michelin's key design representative\n\ntestified tliat this data was supposedly an essential tool used by Michelin's staff in\n\nguiding its tire design and quality assurance work on an ongoing basis. (Id.)\n\nFurthermore, this testimony serves as the basis for Michelin's summary\n\njudgment motion asserting that Michelin cannot be found to have engaged in the\n\nnecessary bad faith to warrant the imposition of punitive daniages because it\n\nemployed design and manufacturing quality assurance proc.edures. (See Doc.\n\n205.)\n\n    The adjustment data would be extremely relevant to Plaintiffs' ability to\n\nestablish whether Michelin knew of identified defects in its tires based on the\n\nreturn information through the warranty process. As Mr. Patrick confirmed, the\n\nadjustment data could be analyzed to determine whether tires were being\n\nreturned for conditions resulting from a manufacturing versus a design issue.\n\n(Id. at 100-105.) Accordingly, at the conclusion of the September 19th sanctions\n\nhearing, the Court ordered Michelin to provide further clarification of the chart's\n\ndata and mode of inforniation presentation.        Until the Court's Order at the\n\n\n                                         27\n\n                                                                                   MR 0533\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 29 of 61\n\n\n\n\nconclnsion of the September 19,        2011   sanctions hearing, Michelin delayed in\n\nproducing information essential to assessing the comparative data it finally\n\nproduced in the chart it provided to Plaintiffs on July 19,       2011,   thus seriously\n\nimpeding Plaintiffs' preparation of their case.\n\n     By withholding the information necessary to understand the adjustment\n\ndata in the chart, Michelin effectively attempted to prevent Plaintiffa from using\n\nthe adjustment data to establish whether the tire at issue was being returned for\n\ncertain manufacturing or design conditions, whether Michelin was aware of these\n\nconditions in the tire, and whether Michelin made any changes to the tire as a\n\nresult of a high return rate. Moreover, the \"special\" chart that Michelin has now\n\nprovided is clearly not a full substitute for producing the actual graphs or graph\n\ndata that Michelin's staff used to review and assess comparative return aud\n\nfailure rates of its various tire lines. Given the centrality of this data to Michelin's\n\ndesign and quality assurance processes - processes that Michelin seeks to use as\n\na lynchpin of its product liability defense in this case - the Court is skeptical that\n\nMichelin would not maintain such documents and data.\n\nD.    Michelin's Misrepresentations Abont Reaction Limits and\n      Prodnction Tolerances and the Failnre to Prodnce Those\n      Docnments\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that Michelin also made misrepresentations to the Court\n\nregarding reaction limits and production tolerance documents so as to persuade\n\nJudge Story to limit his .January 3,   2011   Order based on a false factual predicate.\n\n\n                                          28\n\n                                                                                     MR 0534\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 30 of 61\n\n\n\n\nThey also maintain that Michelin failed to fully prodnce all available relevant\n\ndocuments responsive to the three Requests for Production covering these\n\ndocuments.\n\n       The documents at issue here were initially the subject of the discovery\n\ndispute that led to the December         20, 2010    discovery hearing and the .January 3,\n\n2011   Order compelling production of documents. Plaintiffs requested \"reaction\n\nlimits\" documents in RPD 16, \"design and production tolerances\" in RPD 25, and\n\n\"tolerances for plies and belt materials\" in RPD 35.' 6 Reaction limits and\n\ntolerances are used by tire builders ·during the manufacturing process to\n\ndetermine whether the tires comply with their design specifications. Michelin\n\ndefines \"reaction limits\" as \"tl1e maximum variation allowed in product, process,\n\nor material and still be considered fit for 'right the first time.\"\"' (MNA 9636.)\n\n\n16\n   The full text of tl1ese Requests to Produce are set forth below:\n        llPJ2..t6.: Produce the following documents, any similar documents and any docun1ents\n        discussing the listed documents speciJlcally identified in the complaint: (a) 111e Bad\n        Habits J..,ist of manufacturing issues; (b) Decision Tree documents; (c) Asset\n        S1}ecifications docu1nents; (d) Reaction J,,imits documents; (e) Product Standards and\n        Guidelines Manual for Required Tire l)imensional Tolerances; (f) Documents relating to\n        and including an inteJnal study by Tokita entitled \"Long Term Durability of Tires\"; and\n        (g) All -witness statements frorn current or former Michelin employees or sworn\n        depositions from current or former Michelin employees in F'ord v.

On the other hand, \"product variation outside of the\n\ntolerance limits is non-confirming; this product must be tagged and placed in the\n\nnon-conforming area.

Hr'g Tr. 38-39,\n\n42-43, Doc. 104.)       In response, the Court inquired: \"If you gave the reaction\n\nlimits and the decision trees, that would cover those tolerances.\" 22 (Id. at 42:22-\n\n23.) Ms. Helm responded: \"That would [cover] the manufacturing tolerances\n\nbecause that's really what they are, Your Honor. So I believe that's duplicative of\n\nthe earlier discussion.\" (Id. at 42:24-43:1.)\n\n       Based on Michelin's representations that the reaction and tolerance limits\n\ndocuments had in fact been produced, the Court did not order any further\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Michelin counsel advised the (;ourt, \"We've produced the entire design file ... We've produced\nthe specifications which show ho\\v the tire is to be manufactured and the measurements and the\ncomponents and. all of that.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g 'l'r. 42:15-21, Doc. 104.)\n22\n   According to Ms. Helm, decision trees (or aspect specifications) are the criteria used by tire\nbuilders to test tl1e production quality for cured tires whereas reactio11 limits (used\ninterchangeably by Helm with tolerances) are the criteria used by tire 'builders to test the\nproduction quality for uncured tires.

Specifically,\n\nthe Order stated as follows:\n\n      RPD 16: Defendant shall produce documents responsive to (b)\n      [Decision Tree Documents] and (c) [Asset Specifications documents]\n      that were in effect during the agreed upon time frame and which\n      relate to processes at issue: trapped air, placement of steel belts,\n      molding issues, and adhesion issues. Should other components and\n      processes be identified in the future by Plaintiffs, Defendant shall be\n      required to produce documents related to those components and\n      processes as well. The Court finds that the information sought in\n      [(d) Reaction Limits Documents] has been provided by Defendant in\n      the development files already produced. Therefore no further\n      production is required.\n\n      RPDs 25 and 35: The documents requested [tolerances] are\n      covered by the Court's rulings as to RPD 16.\n\n(Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\n      On July 28, 2011, Michelin's former employee tire-design expert, Mr.\n\nPatrick was deposed and testified that he had reviewed the development file\n\nproduced by Michelin and it did not in fact contain the reaction limits or\n\ntolerances as had been represented to the Court at the December 20th hearing.\n\n(Patrick Dep. 64-65, July 28, 2011.) Nine days earlier, on July 19, 2011, in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions for withholding documents\n\nresponsive to RPD 50 (documents discussing specific tire defects), Michelin for\n\nthe first time produced documents (MNA 8779, MNA 9634-9658) that defined\n\nthe notable difference between tolerances and reaction limits and made clear that\n\nPlaintiffs' requests for tolerance and reaction limit data and documents would\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\n                                                                                MR 0538\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112         Page 34 of 61\n\n\n\n\nnot be duplicative. Until that time, Plaintiffs had accepted the accuracy of the\n\nrepresentations of Michelin's counsel to the Comt at the December 20th hearing.\n\nHowever, these new internal Michelin documents revealed that Michelin's\n\nrepresentations to the Conrt at the December 20th conference were inaccurate\n\nand had effectively restricted discovery of substantive information bearing on\n\nMichelin's tire design and manufacturing process.\n\n      The Court recognizes that the reaction and tolerance limit tire\n\nmanufacturing terms - however significant for this case - are terms of art that\n\nMichelin counsel might have confused at the Deeember 20, 2010, hearing, as Ms.\n\nHelm maintained in her testimony at the September 19, 2011 hearing. (Sept. 19,\n\n2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 161:4-6, Doc. 230.). However, Ms. Helm testified at the\n\nSeptember 19th hearing that immediately npon reviewing the Court's .January 3,\n\n2010 discovery Order, she realized the Conrt \"pnt reaction limits in the\n\ndevelopment file\" and that she knew that was not correct.             (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 161-62, Doc. 230.) Most significantly, in response to the\n\nCourt's inquiry at the September 19th hearing Ms. Helm testified that in .January\n\n2011 or thereafter she did not advise the Court that the Order was incorrect\n\nbecause of her earlier erroneous representation to the Court nor did she go back\n\nand clarify the issne for the Plaintiffs - despite Michelin's later filing a motion for\n\nreconsideration of the ruling on RPD 37 (with respect to the adjustment data).\n\n(Id. at 161-62). Ratl1er, Ms. Helm testified that she simply eonfirmed for herself\n\n\n                                          33\n\n\n                                                                                    MR 0539\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 35 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthat no such reaction limit documents were still available from the 1998-2001\n\ntimeframe (because that was the time scope which the Court had applied to the\n\nproduction under RPD 16 after being advised the reaction limit data and\n\ndocument' would be included in the development file produced). 2 s\n\n        While Ms. Helm may not have originally on December 20, 2010,\n\nintentionally misled the Court, her subsequent failure to correct the mistake once\n\nshe realized the Court relied on her statements to conclude that the documents\n\nhad been produced in the development file is plainly unacceptable. As of the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing, more than eight months after Michelin's\n\ncounsel's review of Judge Story's Order of January 3, 2011, Michelin had not\n\nproduced the reaction limits or tolerances despite its realization that it had\n\nrepresented to the Court that those documents had previously been produced.\n\nMichelin effectively kept the Plaintiffs and the Comt in the dark by allowing them\n\nto rely on inaccurate information, which Michelin knew to be false upon its\n\nreceipt of the January 3rd Order. In essence, Michelin thereby precluded the\n\nPlaintiffs from asking the Court to reconsider its application of a restricted time\n\nscope for these specific production requests. 2 4\n\n\n23 According to Ms. Hehn's testimony at tl1e September 19th hearing, Michelin did not produce\nthe reaction limits for an uncured (\"green\") P235/7oll15 lJniroyal l,aredo AWR ORWL tire\nbecause these documents for the 1998-2001 timeframc were outside their document retention\nperiod and were not captured by any prior litigation hold. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g ·rr.\n93:15-17; 99:2-10, Doc. 230.)\n21\n ' Plairttiffs had argue(l for an unli1nited time scope to apply to these specific document requests\n(RPD 16). I-Iowevcr, the ,January 3rd Order provided a limited time scope to Rl)D 16, but 11ot to\n\n\n                                                34\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0540\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 36 of 61\n\n\n\n\n       Indeed, Michelin was aware that, although reaction limits no longer existed\n\nfor the parties' agreed scope, documents concerning reaction limits for other tires\n\nmanufactured at the Ardmore plant post-2001 existed that had been caught by a\n\nprior litigation hold and were produced in other cases. (Id. at 228:18-229:10.)\n\nWhile Michelin disputes the relevance of these documents, the Plaintiffs have\n\npersuasively argued that they are directly relevant to their proof of Michelin's\n\ndefective manufacturing and inspection process. (Id. at 255-257.) In any event,\n\nuntil these issues came to light in ,July 2011 after t11e Court's Orders, Michelin\n\nneither clarified the record nor made responsive documents available. Yet, at the\n\nDecember 20, 2010 discovery hearing, Michelin's counsel assured the Court that\n\nshe was not seeking lo limit the production of the tire manufach1ring and\n\ninspection process docmnents \"so narrow that it ends up I produce zero . . .\n\nThese documents exist and I know they exist.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Hr'g Tr. 35-36.)\n\nMoreover, Mr. Patrick's testimony confirmed that reaction limits and tolerances\n\narc not tire specific, but relate to the particular processes used at the individual\n\nplants and therefore these documents should not have been subject to the 1998-\n\n2001 temporal scope. (Patrick Dep. 25-26.) For tl1e foregoing reasons, the Court\n\nfinds Michelin improperly manipulated the course of discovery and the Court's\n\n\n\nn1ultiple others requested by Michelin. As discussed below, the Court li1nited the production\nrcS]_Jonsive to RPD 16 in an cffo1t to address Michelin's concern<;; regarding disclosure of\nconfidential trade secrets and a potentially over-inclusive docurnent production in light of the\nevolution of tl1e tire design and manufacturing process.\n\n\n                                              35\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0541\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 37 of 61\n\n\n\n\nreview of the discovery disputes at issue in the December 20, 2010 discovery\n\nhearing and the Court's Order of January 3, 2011.\n\n       After learning that Michelin had produced reaction limits in other cases at\n\nthe September 19th sanctions hearing, Plaintiffs requested that the Court order\n\nMichelin to produce these documents. On September 23, 2011, the court ordered\n\nMichelin to produce the reaction limits documents identified although they fell\n\noutside the 1998-2001 time scope. Michelin produced the documents as ordered\n\non September 28, 2011. 'S Plaintif!S assert in their response to Michelin's motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment that it became clear after Michelin produced the\n\ndocuments why it fought production for so long. According to Plaintiffs, the\n\nsubject tire failed to meet the tolerance limits and should have been scrapped.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs persuasively argued that these documents would go\n\ndirectly to the defect issue.          Michelin would never have produced these\n\ndocuments to Plaintiffs in this case without the Court's intervention. Without\n\nthese documents, Plaintiffs' ability to prove a defect in the tire would be\n\nhampered and the delayed production resulted in prejudice to Plaintiffs as\n\ndiscussed more fully below.\n\n\n\n\n25\n   Indeed, Michelin voluntarily 1)roduced 700 pages of docurnents it deemed nonresponsive to\nPlaintiffs' discovery requesb:; after receiving Plaintiffs' second sanctions request but did not\nproduce the reaction 1i1nits until ordered to do so by the Court after the September 19th\nsanctions hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0542\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 38 of 61\n\n\n\n\nE.      Michelin's Failnrc to Prodnce Certain Docmnents in Response to\n        RPD50\n\n        A substantial part of Plaintiffs' second sanctions request centers around\n\nMichelin's alleged failure to produce documents in response to Plaintiffs' RPD\n\n50.' 6 RPD 50 identified several defects that Plaintiffs believed existed in the\n\nsubject tire and asked for documents discussing how design and manufacturing\n\nproblems or deficiencies can result in those defects in tires generally. Michelin\n\ninitially objected to RPD 50 on the basis that it was not limited in scope to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action and refused to produce\n\ndocuments on those grounds. Plaintiffs opposed these limitations because RPD\n\n50 was not crafted to be tire or plant specific.\n\n        Consequently, the parties addressed t11e scope of RPD 50 with the Court at\n\nthe December 20th discovery hearing. Plaintiffs' counsel expressly argued that\n\nRPD 50 should not be limited to the 1998-2001 timeframe because RPD 50 is\n\nbroader in scope than the tire at issue.'7 (See Dee. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 23:24-\n\n\n26\n    RPD 50 provides as follows \"Please i)roduce any docnn1ents which discuss how desig11 or\nmanufacturing problems or deficiencieB can result ir1 the folloV1ing conditions: a) air pocl<:ets; b)\noxidation; c) internal belts not lined u1); d) spread.ing in internal beltr-;; e) tire overshaped in\nmold; f) brassy Vl:'ires with poor adhesion to belts and rubber; and g) reversion.\"\n27\n   Michelin's assertion that its interpretation of the Court's Order on RPD 50 as being su~ject to\nt11e 1998-2001 temporal scope applied to RPD 16 \"given tl1at plaintiffs' coun.sel had riot clearly\nstated anything to the contra1y\" at the December 20 hearing is ·flatly contrary to the hearing\ntranscript. (See Dec. 20i 2010 Disc. Jir'g Tr. 24:20-25:18, Doc. 104.) Michelin's contention that\nits interpretation of RJ)D 50 and the Court's Janua1y :3rd Order was also based on statements by\nPlaintiffs' counsel that there was no longer a dispute regarding the agreed scope is likewise\nspurious. In their November lOi 2010 letter-motion to the Court, Plaintiffs asserted that\nMichelin narrowed its production of docume11ts to one year before and one year after the date\nthe subject tire was manufactured despite the parties' negotiatior1 of an agreed scope of 1998-\n\n\n                                                 37\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0543\n\f           Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 39 of 61\n\n\n\n\n25:11, Doc. 104.) Indeed, the Conrt recognized that not all of Plaintiffs' requests\n\nwere tire specific requests and that it was clear that some of Plaintiffs' requests\n\nsought information \"generally on the part of Michelin as opposed to how it may\n\nspecifically relate to a given tire.\" (Id. at 10:8-13.) Michelin's counsel did not\n\nprovide any response in support of limiting the scope of RPD 50. 28 While\n\nPlaintiffs were ultimately interested in whether certain design and manufacturing\n\ndeficiencies resulted in the defects in the Bates tire, it is dear from the language\n\nof the request itself and Plaintiffs' counsel's statements at the December 20th\n\n\n2001. As a result, Plaintiffs requested that tl1e Court order Michelin to expand its production to\nthe   S(~opc   as originally agreed of 1998-2001 for specific requests. In its December 16, 2010\nresponse to the Court, counsel for Michelin acknovvle<lged that not all docurn.ents covered by the\nagreed scope had beer1 produced and represented that Michelin had supplernented its response\nand produced all documents subject to the agreed scope. Based on this response, Plaintiffs\ninformed the Court at the December 20th hearing that the parties had resolved tl1is issue vvith\nthe agreed scope ±Or specific RPDs and it 11eed not be addressed by the Court. Michelin's\nreliance on this statement by Ms. May addressing \\Vhich years were covered by the agreed scope\nas support for its assertion that RPD 50 was su~ject to the 1998-2001 agreed time scope is\nmLsplaced. As discussed infra, Plaintiffs' counsel also continued to argue for an unlhnited time\nand plant scope for other specific RPDs, including RPD 50.\n28\n   On the other hand, Michelin opposed Plaintiffs' argument that ItrD 16 should 11ot be limited\nto documents in effect at the time the subject tire was manufactured because Plaintiffs sought to\nidentify what Michelin lmew about J)roblems vvith its tires and its manufacturing processes\nbefore the time the subject tire was specifically manufactured. (Id. at 6:7-11.) Based on an\nAffidavit from a Michelin employee detailing the evolving design and manufacturing process for\nMichelin tires, the Court expressed concern that if RPD 16 (which called for documents subject\nto protection as trade secrets) were not limited to some extent, it would require the production\nof a voluminous amount of docwncnts concerning unrelated tires and unrelated components\nand processes at issue. (Id. at 7:19-5.) The parties ultimately agreed at the hearing to limit the\nscope of RPD 16 to passenger tires. Micl1elin requested that the Court liinit its production of\ndocuments in response to RPI) 16 to the components and processes at issue and (although not\nlimited to the subject tire itse1D to the docn1nents that were in use at the time the subject tire\nwas made (rather t11an the agreed four year scope). (Id. at 33-35.) With the assurance that a\nco1nplete development file had been produced, the Court entered its January 3rd Order with\nrespect to RPI) 16 requiring Mic.helin to \"produce docmnents . , . that were in effect during the\nagreed upon time frame and which relale to the processes at issue: trapped aiI\\ placement of\nsteel belts, rnolding issues, and adhesiorl issues.\" (Doc. 90 at 4.)\n\n\n                                                38\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0544\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 40 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndiscoveiy hearing that RPD 50 was crafted to reach Michelin's knowledge about\n\ntire defects in general.        Although the Court expressly applied the temporal\n\nlimitation requested by Michelin to other RPDs (i.e., 16, 47 & 48) in the January\n\n3rd Order, the Court delineated no temporal limit for the scope of RPD 50 and\n\nordered Michelin to \"produce the requested documents for the components and\n\nprocesses at issue.\" (Doc. 90 at 5.)\n\n       According to Plaintiffs, Michelin produced very few documents following\n\nthe Court's January 3rd Order. In fact, Michelin confirmed at the September\n\n19th sanctions hearing that the only documents initially produced in response to\n\nRPD 50 were the aspect specifications and decision trees (terms used\n\ninterchangeably) that were specifically identified by Plaintiffs in RPD 16. 2 0 (Sept.\n\n19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 98:19-23; 156:21-157:19, Doc. 230.) At the December\n\n20, 2010 discovery hearing, Ms. Helm represented to the Court that Michelin was\n\nnot trying to limit the scope of the requests so narrowly so as to end np having to\n\n\n\n\n29\n    Michelin limited its rcspon.-;e to RPD 50 to these <locurnents because of its admitted\n\"interpretation\" of RPD 50 as asldng for the same documents as HJlD 16. Michelin's\ninterpretation is unreasonable for a number of reasons. First, RPl) 16 and RPD 50 call for\ndifferent documents. H.PD 16 reque.<;ts produc:tion of seven specific categories of documents\nidentified by name. RJ)D 50 requests production of all documents relating to certain design and\nmanufacturing defects. Second, Plaintiffs addressed RPD 16 and RPD 50 separately at the\nDecember 20th hearing and dcscril)ed the differences between the requ(:sts. Ms. May discussed\nRPD 16 as being a more narrow request targeting spec-ific documents, (.Id. at 5:18-6:20), an(l\ncharac\"i:erized RPD 50 as asldng for a broader scope of document.stied to the~ specific defects at\nissue in the case, (Id. at 10:24-11:12.) Finally, the Court compelled production separately under\nRPI) 16 and RPD 50, in contrast to its treatrnent of RPD 16 (calling for reaction limits) as being\nsynonymous vvith RPDs 25 and 35 (calling for tolerances). (Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\n\n                                               39\n\n                                                                                               MR 0545\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01/13/12 Page 41 of 61\n\n\n\n\nproduce essentially nothing in response.\"\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 35:17-\n\n36:6, Doc. 104.)        However, at the September 19, 2011 sanctions hearing,\n\nMichelin's counsel (Ms. Cahoon), stated that because the subject tire went out of\n\nproduction by April 2007 \"many of the documents, in fact as we'll see later,\n\nvirtually all of the documents about manufacture [sic] are gone under retention\n\npolicies before there's ever a lawsuit about the Bates' tire.\"             (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 92:2-9, Doc. 230.) Counsel further stated that \"there was a\n\npretty clear, we thought, understanding with opposing counsel that there were\n\ngoing to be very few, if anything, by way of documents still available from the '98\n\nto 2001 agreed time frame.\"          (Id. at 104:13-16.) Michelin's position at the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing presented a remarkable about-face from its\n\ncounsel's representation to the Court ten months earlier that if RPD 50 was\n\nframed to cover the summary processes ultimately identified in the Court's\n\nJanuary 3rd Order, she could say that \"[t]hese documents exist and I know they\n\nexist.\") (Dec. 20, 2010 Hr'g Tr. 35-36, Doc. 104).\n\n       However, during the deposition of Michelin's in-house experts in June and\n\n,July 2011, Plaintiffs learned that internal documents such as tire production\n\nstandards, training manuals, and Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis\n\n(FMEAs) existed that Plaintiffs contend should have been produced in response\n\n\n30\n   Michelin ad1nittcdly has ar1 aggressive document destruction policy and retains apparently\nonly the narrowest range of docu1nents necessary for business and regulatory reasons.\n\n\n                                             40\n\n                                                                                          MR 0546\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 42 of 61\n\n\n\n\nto RPD 50. Michelin responded that it had not been required to produce these\n\ndocuments because in its view the January 3rd Order on RPD 50 was limited to\n\nthe tire at issue, the temporal scope of 1998-2001, and documents from the\n\nArdmore plant.'\" Accordingly, Michelin represented to the Court at the July 7th\n\ndiscovery conference that it had produced all documents (almost none) that\n\nexisted subject to those limitations.\n\n       The Court finds that Michelin's interpretation of RPD 50 and the Comt's\n\nJanuary 3rd Order is neither reasonable nor supp01ted by the record as Michelin\n\ncontends.      Michelin interpreted RPD 50 as being redundant of RPD 16.32\n\nConsequently, because the Court's January 3rd Order limited RPD 16 to the\n\n1998-2001 time scope, Michelin treated RPD 50 as also being subject to the 1998-\n\n2001 time scope. As discussed in footnote 29 above, RPD 16 and RPD 50 call for\n\ndifferent documents. Ms. Helm testified at the September 19th sanctions hearing\n\nas to her reading of the Court's January 3rd Order:\n\n       The first thing I interpreted was [the Court] had not limited it to the\n       documents in effect at the time the tire was made, which would have\n       been the documents in use on the 32nd week of 2000. But I read it\n31\n   Nonetheless, Michelin contends that even though it does not believe the trainirtg rnanuals and\n1)roduction standards were responsive to RPD 50, it has since produced (after Plaintiffs' second\nsanctions motion) wl1at is currently available, although not those documents contemporaneous\nin time with the design and manufacture of the tire because those documents no longer exist.\n32 IIowever, the Court notes that Michelin asserted in its December 16, 2010 response to\nPlaintiffs' letter-1notion seeking to compel documents separately under RPD 16 and RPD 50,\nthat RPD 50 \"is inconsistent with Plaintiffs' demand for documents on numerous conditions\nrelating to Request No. 16(b)-(e). If the conditions and components identified in Request No.\n50 are those at issue, MNA will search for and produce the documents in place when the Subject\nTire was manufactured that address those conditions and components.\" (Ex. 3 to Resp. to\nMotion for Sanctions, Doc. 193-4.)\n\n\n                                               41\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0547\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 43 of 61\n\n\n\n\n       as the broader temporal scope of all documents in use from '98 to\n       2001 that related to the components and processes at issue, which\n       we had addressed in the hearing were the aspect specifications or\n       the decision trees, because those were the documents that\n       specifically addressed components or processes.\n\n(Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 156-57, Doc. 230.) The January 3rd Order\n\nspecifically limited Michelin's response to RPD 16 to documents \"in effect during\n\nthe agreed upon time frame.\" (Doc. 90 at 4.) However, with respect to RPD 50,\n\nthe January 3rd Order contains no temporal limitation. Ms. Helm acknowledged\n\nat the September 19th hearing that the January 3rd Order did not contain the\n\nwords \"1998 to 2001\" with respect to the production required for RPD 50 but that\n\nshe limited the Order to that time frame. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 238,\n\nDoc. 230.) Ms. Helm never sought further clarification from the Court on this\n\nissue in the event there was actual confusion.\n\n       Michelin's interpretation is completely unsupported by the language of the\n\nOrder differentiating between RPD 16 and RPD 50 and the essence of counsel's\n\ndiscussion with the Court at the December 20, 2010 hearing,33 (Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\nBy interpreting RPD 50 as requesting the same documents as RPD 16, Michelin\n\nlimited its production to only those specific documents already known and\n\nidentified by Plaintiffs.         Michelin thereby avoided producing any other\n\ndocuments which discuss how design or manufacturing problems or deficiencies\n33\n    Michelin asserts tl1at Plaintiffs acquiesced to its interpretation by failing to interpose any\nobjection. This is inaccurate. Rather than ac{111ic·scing to Michelin's treatment of RPD 16 and\nl{_PD 50 as beit1g synonymous, Plaintiffs sought an order com1)elling production of docu1nents in\nresponse to both RPD 16 and RPD 50.\n\n\n                                               42\n\n                                                                                               MR 0548\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 44 of 61\n\n\n\n\ncan result in the alleged defective conditions at issne, i.e. the training documents\n\nand tire prodnction standards discovered by Plaintiffs as having been withheld.\n\nThe Court therefore must conclude that Michelin made a calculated decision to\n\n\"interpret\" the Court's discovery order in the narrow way it saw fit so as to justify\n\nwithholding entire categories of documents that were unambiguously responsive\n\nto Plaintiffs' request in violation of the Court's direct Order.\n\nF.      Michelin's July 19th Produc,-tion in Response to RPD 50\n\n        Despite its steadfast position at the July 7th conference with the Court that\n\nit had complied with the Comt's January 3rd Order and previously produced all\n\nrequired documents, on July 19,            2011,     Michelin produced over        700   pages of\n\ndocuments in connection with RPD 50 in response to Plaintiffs' second request\n\nfor sanctions.34\n\n        One eateg01y of documents Michelin produced on July 19th after Plaintiffs\n\nmoved for sanci:ions referred to as \"Failure Mode and Effects Analysis\" (FMEAs)\n\n34\n   Plaintiffs contend that the adjustment data (specifically requsted in RPD 37) should have also\nbeen produced as responsive to llPD 50 because: (1) the adjustment conditions described a\nreason for whicl1 a tire might be returned; (2) some adjustment sets addressed problems\noriginating with the manufacturing process; and (3) most adjustment condition.c.; listed\nevolutions associated vvith the adjustment condition, i.e problems that could develop if the\nreturned tire \\vas not repaired or replaced. Therefore) according to Plaintiffl'>, \"when an\nadjustment condition belonged to a 'manufacturing' set and was expected to evolve into\n'<>xidati<>n' or the 'infiltration of air' into the rubber, tl1at adjustment condition \\Vas directly\nresponsive to RP]) 50.\" (Doc. 180 at 8.) While the Court agrees that the acljustment data n1ay\nhave been responsive to RPD 50, Michelin sought reconsideration of the January 3rd Order\ncompelling production of the adju&1:1ne11t code data regardless of which of Plaintiffs' RPDs the\ndocuments were responsive to. The Court therefore does not find that Michelin's failure to\nproduce the adjustinent code data in response to llPI) 50 prior t.v the Court's Order on\nDefendant's Motion for Reconsideration (I)oc. 123) was done in bad faith or warrants sanctions\nfor any docu1nents not produced prior to April 28, 2011.\n\n\n                                                43\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0549\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 45 of 61\n\n\n\n\nare internal Michelin documents demonstrating how Michelin evaluates its\n\nmanufacturing process to determine the different ways tires can fail, the effect of\n\nthe failure, and how to fix the identified deficiency,3s Michelin contends that it\n\nproduced these documents in good faith, even though Michelin does not believe\n\nthem to be responsive to Plaintiffs' requests, and that its subsequent production\n\nof these documents should not be used as a basis for imposing the sanction\n\nrequested by Plaintiffs,36 To the contrary, these documents are dearly very\n\nrelevant to Plaintiffs' claims and are directly responsive to RPD 50, The FMEAs\n\ndiscuss the precise conditions identified by Plaintiffs in RPD 50, Le,, trapped air,\n\nadhesion, molding, how those conditions develop in the manufacturing process,\n\nand the methods for detection and prevention of those conditions in a tire before\n\nit leaves the plant,\n\n       As Plaintiffs noted at the September 19th sanctions hearing, Michelin\n\ncharacterized RPD 50 as calling for \"cause and effect\" documents and the FMEAs\n\n---------------\n35 Altho11gh Michelin produced FMEAs that deal with the manufacturing process on July 19th,\nPlaintiffs contend that Michelin is still withholding FMEAs that deal ¥\\1th the design process,\nPlaintiffs learned about the existence of these documents during the July 28th deposition of Mr,\nPatriclc wl10 testified that Michelin also creates and uses FMEAs tl1at deal vvith problems that\nari.se during the (h.'A.;;ign phase, At the September 19th sanctions hearing Michelin ad1nitted the\ndesign FMEAs were not in the design file that was produced: \"We agree they \\Vere not in t11at\nfile, but we 11ever represented that the file wag c::on1plete at all. But what we were able to locate,\nit was produced ... So, there's a lot to evaluate how the tire was designed, even though we can't\nsay that we've got everything,'' (Sept, 19, 2011 Sanction..<; Hr'g Tr. 118: 10-20, l)oc, 230.)\n16\n    Mic::helin redacted \"nonresponsive information\" from several pageg of the FMf:,A docuincnt,\n(MNA 9234- 9271.) Based on the digcovery record thus far, Plaintiffs question the propriety of\nthese redactions and 'vhether the redacted information pertains to the alleged tire defect. The\n(;ourt therefore DIRECTS Michelin to submit these un-redacted pages for the Court's in-\nca1nera inspection.\n\n\n                                                 44\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0550\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 46 of 61\n\n\n\n\nare Michelin's ultimate \"cause and effect\" documents. These documents should\n\nhave been produced in response to RPO 50 and without question in response to\n\nthe January 3rd Order compelling production under RPD 50.37 Michelin was\n\nobligated to produce these documents in discovery without the threat of\n\nsanctions but failed to do so. The Court finds that Michelin's excuses fall short in\n\nlight of its obligation to cooperate fully in discovery following an order\n\ncompelling produc'l:ion, an order imposing monetary sanc'l:ions, and the court's\n\nprior warning that additional evidence of discovery abuse would not be tolerated.\n\nSee Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., 987 F.2d 1536, 1543 (nth Cir. 1993) (rejec'l:ing\n\nthe defendants' claim that they simply misunderstood the scope of the discovery\n\norders because defendants failed to offer credible explanations and failed to ask\n\nthe court for clarification of allegedly confusing orders). Moreover, as the Court\n\nin Malautea noted, \"ultimately, the [plaintiffs] had to file a motion for sanctions\n\nto force the [defendant] to comply with the court's orders.\" Id. at 1540. Thus,\n\nMichelin's post-sanctions production of documents does not excuse its conduct\n\nor obviate the need for sanctions.\n\n       Another category of documents Plaintiffs discovered had not been\n\nproduced in response to the Court's ,January 3rd Order were tire building training\n\nmaterials and production standards identified by Michelin's in-house\n37 During tl1e sanctions hearing, PlaiI1tiffs discussed the relevance of other types of docu1nents\nthat were produce{l on July 19 that described how certain n1anufacturing processes resulted in\nthe precise defects at issue. T11e Court has reviewed these documents and finds that these\ndocuments likewise should have been produced far earlier in response to RPD 50.\n\n\n                                               45\n\n                                                                                               MR 0551\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 47 of 61\n\n\n\n\nmanufacturing expert ,Jack Glazcner.38 At the hearing, Ms. Helm testified that\n\nMichelin decided to produce the training materials39 and tire production\n\ndocmuents referenced by Mr. Glazener in his deposition even though Michelin\n\ndid not regard those documents as being responsive to RPD 50 because Plaintiffs\n\nasked for them specifically in their request for sanctions.                      (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 163-64, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm further testified that Michelin\n\nhas produced such training manuals in the past when specifically requested to do\n\nso. (Id. at 164:2-12.) It appears that Michelin's modus operandi here has been -\n\nat very best - to only produce documents specifically identified by Plaintiffs\n\ndespite the fact a broader set of documents would be responsive to a general\n\ndiscovery request. This ease is eerily similar to Malautea in this regard where the\n\nCourt imposed the sanction of default.\n\n       Another technique the Defendants have used to avoid revealing the\n       truth is to refuse to answer general questions, choosing instead to\n       limit the question to a narrower field. The Plaintiff sought, in\n\n38\n     Ms. Helm testified at the hearing that Michelin did not characterize tire production standards\n(also refen·ed to as tire building procedures) as discussing cause and effect type relationships\nbecause \"they are placed rsic] - thi<> - this component on this drun1 at this angle, check this,\nmove on the next step, do this. It's very much a - it's kind oflilce following a recipe.\" (Sept. 19,\n2011 Sanctions IIr'g Tr. 167, Doc. 230.) This explanation is unavailing - the failure to follow the\nproper procedures is a l)rime exan1ple of a cause and effect relationship. As anyone \\vi.th\ncooking experience is \\Vell aware) the failure to follow certain recipes or to add ingredients in the\nright order can prove disastrous to tl1e final product.\n:-19 On July i9th, Michelin produced quizzes that it gave employees, but only produced answer\nkeys to so1r1c of them. For exa1nple, Michelin produced a quiz with the fo1lo\\ving question\n\"·---is used to prevent a tread separation.\" (Pls.' Ex. X Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g, MNA\n9034) At the hearing Ms. Helm testified that the answers to the quizzes were located on the\nopposite side of the quiz page ai1d could be found in the other materials procluced (MNA 8796 to\n8828) but that no separate answer lceys were available for these particular qUi7.zes. (Sept. 19,\n2011 Sanc'tions Hr'g 1'r. 168:8-169:3, l)oc. 230.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0552\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Fried 01/13/12 Page 48 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      nnmerons interrogatories and requests for production of documents,\n      information no only ahont the 1988 112 Samnrai, bnt also abont other\n      model years and ahont similar sport ntility vehicles ... In all of the\n      early responses to interrogatories, the Defendants steadfastly\n      insisted that Plaintiff was entitled only to information concerning\n      the 1988 112 model year Snznki Samnrai.             Accordingly, the\n      Defendants refused, prior to the statns conference, to divnlge any\n      information abont the [other makes and models]. By restricting\n      their answers in this manner, the Defendants managed to avoid\n      revealing a great deal of discoverable information.\n\nMalautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., 148 F.R.D. 362, 366-67 (S.D. Ga. 1991). Such\n\nconduct leaves Plaintiffs and this Court continually uncertain whether all\n\nresponsive documents have been produced.\n\nG.    Michelin's Failure to Produce Expert Reports for Employee\n      Experts Patrick and Glazener\n\n      A final issue for which Plaintiffs seek sanctions is Micl1elin's failure to\n\nproduc,e expert reports for its two in-house employee experts identified in its\n\nRule 26 Expert Disclosures on April 29, 2011. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 26(a)(2)(B)\n\nrequires a written report if the witness is \"one whose duties as the party's\n\nemployee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Michelin's Rule 26 Expert\n\nDisclosures identifies Charles Patrick and Jack Glazener as corporate\n\nrepresentatives having technical knowledge and experience regarding certain\n\nsubject areas pertinent to the litigation. (Doc. 232-14 at 4-5.) See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702. However, Michelin produced no expert reports for these two witnesses.\n\n      Contrary to its representation at the September 19th sanctions hearing,\n\nMichelin did not ever identify Patrick or Glazener as fact witnesses. At the\n\n\n                                       47\n\n                                                                                MR 0553\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 49 of 61\n\n\n\n\nhearing Michelin contended that although it had not identified Glazener and\n\nPatrick in their mandatory disclosures, they were specifically identified as fact\n\nwitnesses on May 11, 2011, in its supplemental responses to Plaintiffs\n\nInterrogatories.       (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 134:11-13, Doc. 230.)\n\nHowever, Glazener and Patrick were only identified at that juncture in response\n\nto Plaintiffs' Interrogatory #4 requesting the identification of Michelin's expert\n\nwitnesses. •0 Indeed, in response to Plaintiffs' Interrogatory # 12 which asked\n\nMichelin to identify the corporate representatives with the most knowledge of the\n\ndesign and manufacturing process, Michelin did not identify Glazener or Patrick\n\nor any other employee or former employee by name.\n\n       Michelin's counsel, Ms. Cahoon, contended that very early in the litigation,\n\n\"there was an indication that Michelin would have some witnesses as fact\n\nwitnesses who would talk about the manufacture and design of the tire. Quite\n\nfrankly, I think Michelin was waiting to see who the tire expert was and what he\n\nwas saying in his report to determine who would be the best fact witnesses to call,\n\nparticularly on the design side, to deal with whatever one could say about\n\nmanufacturing through some knowledgeable witness.\" (Id. at 147.) Ms. Helm\n\nconfirmed it was in fact true and that Mid1elin waited until after Plaintiffs' tire\n\nexpert's report was served to name Glazener and Patrick as fact witnesses \"so that\n\n40\n   Although Michelin only identified Patric}( and Glazener at the end of discovery a.._q experts, it\nsitnu1taneously proclaimed they were not actually experts subject to the requirements of Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 26(a)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0554\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 50 of 61\n\n\n\n\n[Michelin] identified fact witnesses who could address the issues in his report.\"4'\n\n(Id. at 223.) But Glazener and Patrick were never identified as fact witnesses. In\n\nresponse to the Court's concern at the sanctions hearing that Glazener and\n\nPatrick should have been identified earlier as fact witnesses, and while\n\nmaintaining they are fact witnesses, Michelin responded that \"it was a timely\n\nidentification as to experts.\" (Id. at 133:22-23.)\n\n        Michelin identified Mr. Patrick as a Michelin corporate representative\n\nexpected to testify regarding the design of the subject tire and related issnes.\n\n(Doc. 232-14 at 4.) Mr. Patrick was disclosed as having technical knowledge and\n\nexperience regarding the following areas: tire components and nomenclature;\n\ntire design generally; the developmental design process; monitoring of tire\n\nquality and performance; and industry standards and practices regarding tire\n\ndesign. Id. Despite counsel's statement at the September lgth sanctions hearing\n\nto the contrary, Michelin also designated Mr. Patrick to testify that \"the subject\n\ntire's design was not defective.\" Id. Michelin further stated that Mr. Patrick \"may\n\nalso be called to address issues raised by plaintiffs' experts.\" (Doc. 232-16 at 18.)\n\n       Michelin identified Mr. Glazener as a Michelin corporate representative\n\nexpected to testify regarding the manufacture of the subject tire and related\n\n41\n   Michelin maintains this was its strategy dcs1)ite Ms. Helm's representation at the Decen1ber\n20th hearing that \"I'1n national discovery counsel for Michelin, and ... I can take a orte-in-three\nshot as to who their expert is and get it right, at least I - you know, and I proba'bly know \\Vhat\nhis theories arc and I haven't even sec11 the tire yet.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g 1'r. 34:20-35:1,\nDoc. 104.)\n\n\n                                                49\n\n                                                                                                MR 0555\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 51of61\n\n\n\n\nissues.    (Doc. 232-14 at 4.) Mr. Glazener was disclosed as having technical\n\nknowledge and experience regarding the following areas: tire components and\n\nnomenclatnre; tire design generally; mannfactnring and quality assnrance\n\nprocesses in place at the Ardmore, Oklahoma plant at the time the snbject tire\n\nwas manufactured; the Ardmore, Oklahoma manufacturing plant generally;\n\nindustry standards and practices regarding tire manufacturing; and MNA\n\ngenerally. Id. Michelin further stated that Mr. Glazener \"may also be called to\n\ntestify in rebuttal regarding issues raised by plaintiffs' expe1ts.\" (Doc. 232-16 at\n\n19.)\n\n       Plaintiffs have separately filed motions to exclude the testimony of Messrs.\n\nPatrick and Glazener. Therefore, the Court will address the admissibility of\n\ntestimony of these witnesses in a separate order. However, the Court is troubled\n\nby Michelin's extremely late identification of Messrs. Patrick and Glazener, to the\n\nextent they qualify solely as fact witnesses and finds that such a late identification\n\nwas not in good faith and provides further indication of Michelin's pattern of\n\ndiscovery abuse.\n\nH.     Prejudice to Plaintiffs\n\n       As Michelin recognized at the sanctions hearing, the issue in this ease is\n\nwhether the Bates tire was defective - either defective in its design or in its\n\nmanufacturing - and therefore unreasonably dangerous.            The wide array of\n\ndocuments Michelin withheld, is potentially still withholding, and has\n\n\n                                         50\n\n\n                                                                                   MR 0556\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 52 of 61\n\n\n\n\nunquestionably previously destroyed under its internal document \"retention\"\n\npolicy, all go to determining this issue. Michelin claims that the Plaintiffs have\n\nnot been prejudiced in preparing their case to a jury on the merits of the claim\n\nbecause all extant documents have now been produced.\n\n      Michelin's conduct has certainly resulted in delay and disruption of this\n\nlitigation and has hampered the enforcement of this Court's discovery Orders.\n\n8ee Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Corp., 987 F.2d at 1540 (finding that defendants\n\nengaged in an unrelenting campaign to obfuscate the truth by improperly\n\nobjecting to interrogatories, providing incomplete, evasive and unreasonably\n\nnarrow discovery responses, delayed compliance with court orders and thus\n\nhampered the discovery process and showed disdain for the court's orders).\n\nFirst, Michelin's initial production refusal followed by its ongoing delay and\n\nobstruction of discovery central to the case have affected the integrity of the legal\n\nprocess. For example, Michelin's misrepresentations at the December 20, 2010\n\ndiscovery hearing regarding its production of reaction limits and tolerances\n\nresulted in a substantive error in the January 3, 2011 Order that was perpetuated\n\nby Michelin's counsel's failure to correct the Court's misunderstanding about\n\nwhat documents had actually been produced. Michelin refused to produce the\n\ndocuments until ordered to do so by the Comt on September 19, 2011, thereby\n\nprecluding the Plaintiffs from seeking a more expansive production of these\n\ndocuments for over a year and a half.         Moreover, Michelin seeks to limit\n\n\n                                         51\n\n                                                                                  MR 0557\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 53 of 61\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' potential recovery on the gronnds that there is no evidence to support a\n\nclaim for punitive damages after attempting to withhold the very documents on\n\nwhich Plaintiffs rely to demonstrate a conscious indifference to the tire's defective\n\ndesign and manufacture. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 54, Doc. 230.)\n\n         Second, Michelin delayed producing its most relevant documents and data\n\nfor over a year and a half while seeking to exclude the testimony of Plaintiffs' tire\n\nexpert, in part, on the grounds that his opinions are based on insufficient or\n\nunreliable data. (Doc. 203, 204) Yet, Michelin refused to produce documents\n\nand data that might potentially support Plaintiffs' expert's opinions regarding the\n\ndefectiveness of the subject tire.\n\n         Finally, Michelin's dilatory discovery gamesmanship has hampered\n\nPlaintiffs' pursuit of a swift judicial process to provide a remedy addressing the\n\nextreme nature of Mr. Bates' physical injuries. Plaintiffs' steadfast efforts to\n\nmove this case forward to resolution at trial, including their streamlined\n\ndiscovery42 , has been needlessly deferred by Michelin's haggling and endless\n\nparsing over the production of its evidence on its own time schedule. Not only\n\nhas this delay and disruption of the litigation prejudiced Plaintiffs, it\n\ndemonstrates Michelin's bad faith. Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d at 1121. Thus,\n\nMichelin's course of conduct described herein warrants the imposition of\n\n\n42   PlaintiffS submitted only one set of Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents\nand tool<:: a limited number of fact depositions.\n\n\n                                                    52\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0558\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01/13/12 Page 54 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions to remedy the impact of repeated violations of the Court's Orders,\n\ninaccurate representations to the Court, and prolonged abusive discovery\n\nconduct.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n       The Court docs not impose sanctions lightly and has taken great care in the\n\nreview of the record before it in its determination of this matter. The pattern of\n\nabuse by Michelin is extremely troubling. The Court is obligated to uphold the\n\nintegrity of the legal and discovery process to ensure that Plaintiffs here and all\n\nparties have the opportunity to fairly present their claims in a reasonably efficient\n\nand prompt manner. Plaintiffs would not have uncovered the majority of the\n\nmost probative documents in existence in this case but for their persistence in\n\npursuing discovery motions and seeking the Court's intervention. Contrary to\n\nMichelin's assertion that this belated production demonstrates its good faith, it is\n\nprecisely this ongoing belated production, in conjunction with Michelin's\n\nmultiple violations of the Court's Orders and its evasive, hair-splitting and\n\ninaccurate representations to the Court that demonstrate Michelin's bad faith\n\nand why a serious, substa11tive sanction is warra11ted.\n\n       A determination that the tire at issue in this case 1s defective and\n\nunreasonably dangerous is an appropriate sanction to remedy the discovery\n\nabuses perpetrated by Michelin in bad faith and in disregard of this Court's prior\n\ndiscovery Orders. First, Michelin made multiple misrepresentations to the Court\n\n\n                                         53\n\n                                                                                  MR 0559\n\f           Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 55 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthat it had produced documents as ordered by the Court when it in fact had not.\n\nSecond, Michelin repeatedly refused to produce documents in direct violation of\n\nthe Court's January 3rd, June 3rd and .June 24th Orders.           Third, Michelin\n\nintentionally engaged in an extremely narrow, unjustified interpretation of the\n\nCourt's Orders in order to limit, or altogether avoid, producing relevant and\n\nuseful documents in response to Plaintiffs' discovery requests.\n\n          Furthermore, a finding that the tire was defective and unreasonably\n\ndangerous is properly tailored to address Michelin's sanctionable discovery\n\nconduct as set forth below:\n\n          • Michelin's failure to produce adjnstment codes and data: This is the\n\nsecond round of the parties' dispute over the production of the adjustment codes\n\nand data. After the Court's June 24, 2011 Order sanctioning Michelin for its\n\nimproper redaction of the adjustment codes and failure to produce the\n\ndocuments necessary to interpret the list of adjustment codes and conditions,\n\nMichelin again failed to produce all documents ordered by the Court. Despite it.>\n\nspirited representations to the Court on July 7, 2011, that all the adjustment\n\ncodes had been produced as ordered on .June 13, 2011, an additional 113\n\nadjustment codes had been withheld and later had to be produced. While this\n\ninitial    failure   may   not   have   been   intentional,   Michelin's   repeated\n\nmisrepresentations to the Court during the course of discovery call into serious\n\ndoubt the credibility of Michelin's assertions that the failure to produce the\n\n\n                                         54\n\n                                                                                MR 0560\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01113112 Page 56 of 61\n\n\n\n\nadjustment code documents was an innocent, inadvertent mistake that would\n\nhave been cured without Plaintiffs pointing to gaps in the production.\n\n       Moreover, after providing Plaintiffs with a complete list of the codes and\n\nconditions for adjustment, Michelin was required to produce the data\n\ndemonstrating the number of tires returned under Michelin's adjustment\n\nprocess. Subsequent to the Court's June       24, 2011   Order directing Michelin to\n\n\"produce all available tire adjustmeut data and the iuternal mauuals Michelin\n\nuses for classifying or discussing the conditions and issues arising in connection\n\nwith the application of the specific adjustment codes,\" (Doc. 173 at   11),   Michelin\n\ninstead produced an indecipherable chart along with a glossary created for the\n\nlitigation.\n\n       Despite being previously sanctioned for producing a meaningless list of\n\nadjustment conditions without the necessary interpretative documents, Michelin\n\nagain produced a chart of adjustment data that could not even be interpreted by\n\nMichelin's own in-house expert. Mr. Patrick testified that Michelin does not\n\nanalyze its adjustment data in the format produced to Plaintiffs in this litigation\n\nand confirmed that the adjustment data, if presented in a meaningful format,\n\ncould be used to determine whether (and how many) tires were being rctnrned\n\nfor conditions resulting from a manufacturing or design issue, whether Michelin\n\nwas aware of such conditions in the tire, and whether any changes were made to\n\nthe tire as a result of a high return rate. Michelin's production of the adjustment\n\n\n                                        .55\n\n                                                                                   MR 0561\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 57 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndata in this indecipherable format flies in the face of the Court's June    24, 2011\n\nOrder warning Michelin \"that any failure to respond fully in producing these\n\ndocuments and tire data may result in the imposition of sanctions, including ...\n\ndetermination of issue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issue.\" (Doc. 173 at\n\n11.)\n\n       •   Michelin's failure to produce reaction limits and tolerances:         TI1e\n\nreaction limits and tolerances used by tire builders to determine whether and\n\nhow much a tire deviates from its manufacturing specifications and whether the\n\ntire must be scrapped are directly probative of the defect issue. Nonetheless,\n\nMichelin's counsel allowed the Court and Plaintiffs to rely on her inaccurate\n\nstatements at the December      20, 2010   discovery hearing that the reaction limits\n\nand tolerances had been produced in the design file, when they in fact had not\n\nbeen. When counsel realized she had misled the Court after her review of the\n\nCourt's January 3,   2011   Order upon immediate receipt, she failed to contact the\n\nCourt or Plaintiffs' counsel to clarify this seminal issue. Even after Plaintiffs\n\ndiscovered the error during the July       28, 2011   deposition of Mr. Patrick who\n\ntestified that the file did not contain the reaction limits or tolerances, Michelin\n\nrefused to produce relevant documents until ordered by the Court after the\n\nSeptember 19, 2011 sanctions hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\n                                                                                  MR 0562\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 58 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      • Michelin's failureJ:Q_l)roduce__Qocuments rcspon_sive to RPD           50   as\n      compelled on Januazy 3, 2010:\n\n      For nearly two years Michelin failed to produce         700   pages of relevant\n\ndocuments in response to RPD 50 requesting information discussing specific\n\ndefects that may arise in a tire's components and processes based on Michelin's\n\nself-imposed limitation of the temporal scope of the Court's January 3,         2010\n\nOrder.     Despite Michelin's repeated insistence at the December          20, 2010\n\ndiscovery hearing that it was not attempting to limit the scope of Plaintiffs'\n\ndiscovery requests so that it was left having to produce nothing, Michelin's\n\ncounsel's statements at the September 19,    2011   sanctions hearing confirmed that\n\nMichelin knew there were very few documents still in existence within the 1998-\n\n2001 time frame. Tl1us, Michelin's convenie11t \"interpretation\" of the Court's\n\nJanuary 3, 2011 Order compelling production of \"the requested documents for\n\nthe components and processes at issne\" as being snbject to the 1998-2001\n\ntemporal scope, was calcnlated to jnstify its withholding hnndreds of docnments\n\nthat were unquestionably responsive to Plaintiffs' request.\n\n      Because the adjustment codes and data, reaction limits and tolerances, and\n\nthe documents responsive to RPD 50 all specifically relate to Plaintiffs' claim that\n\nthe tire at issue was defective, an order establishing that the subject tire was\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous as manufactured and sold to Plaintiffs is\n\n\n\n\n                                        57\n\n                                                                                    MR 0563\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 59 of 61\n\n\n\n\nnarrowly tailored to remedy Michelin's violations and therefore appropriate\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b). See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 707.\n\n        Michelin objects to Plaintiffs' sanctions request on the grounds that\n\nPlaintiffs did not first initiate a \"meet and confer\" on each of these discovery\n\nissues. The Court previously rejected this argument in its June 24, 2011 Order,\n\nand found that Michelin was ohligated to comply with the Court's January 3, 2011\n\nOrder compelling the production of the documents and that no \"meet and confer\"\n\nsession was required prior to Plaintiffs seeking sanctions for Michelin's failure to\n\nfully comply the Court's prior orders.4'1 Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1542-43 (finding\n\nthat defendants \"richly deserved the sanction of default judgment\" where the\n\ndiscovery orders clearly encompassed the information requested hy plaintiffs\");\n\nIn re Sunshine Jr. Stores, 456 F.3d at \\306. In addition, Michelin received more\n\nthan adequate notice from (1) the Court's multiple warnings that it would not\n\ntolerate any further hampering of the discovery process or violations of its\n\nOrders; (2) Plaintiffs' multiple sanctions requests; and (3) its own flagrant\n\ndisregard of the federal discovery rules and the Court's discovery orders. In re\n\nSunshine Jr. Stores, 456 F.3d at 1306. Therefore, the sanction of issue preclusion\n\nis warranted by the record in this case. Finally, the Court's previous monetary\n43 Moreover, after the (;ourt entered the ,January 3, 201.1 Order compelling production of the\nvarious RPDs, Plaintiffs contend they had no reason to believe that documents were l)eing\nwithheld. Plaintiffs were unaware that other internal Michelin documents existed until the\ndeposition of Michelin's in-hous.-e expert Glazener - ::.i_x months later - who testified about his\n1mowledge of ce1i:ain documents based on his past \\Vork as the Ardmore plant manager.\nMichelin did. not identify Mr. Glazener as a witness until close to the end of discovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0564\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 60 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanction did not serve to remedy Michelin's cavalier attitude toward its\n\nobligations to comply with the Court's Orders and the discovery process.\n\n         In sum, Michelin's bad faith conduct caused serious prejudice to the\n\nintegrity of the legal process and to Plaintiffs' orderly, effective development and\n\nproof of their case. Michelin's course of conduct described herein warrants the\n\nimposition of sanctions to remedy the impact of repeated violations of the Court's\n\nOrders, inaccurate or false representations to the Court, and prolonged abusive\n\ndiscovery conduct. Under the circumstances presented here, a finding of issue\n\npreclusion as to the subject tire's defective and unreasonably dangerous\n\ncondition is authorized as an appropriately tailored sanction remedy. See Ins.\n\nCorp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 707.          However, the Court declines to move beyond\n\nthis serious sanction and will not impose Plaintiffs' additional request for an\n\nissue preclusion determination that the subject tire failed as a result of its\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous condition.44                   The sanction applied is\n\nsufficient under the circumstances to address the scope of Michelin's discovery\n\nabuse.\n\n\n44 'fhe Court recognizes that Michelin has now i)roduced a more complete set of docu1ncnts and\ndata in response to I)laintiffs' Requests for Production and tl1c Court's Orders. 'fhough the\ncredibility of Michelin's representation as to the complete11ess of this production remains in\nquestion for the reasons discussed in this Order, the Co11rt has recognized Michelin's corrective\nprod.uction as a factor in its decisio11 to refrain fron1 imposing Plaintiffs' requested sanction of\ntotal issue preclusion - a determination tl1at the tire failed as a result o.f its defective a11d\nunreasonably dangerous condition. 'IJ1at determination would be the death knell of any\nMichelin defense to liability. Instead, t11e Court has left open the question of whether the failure\nof the tire in fact was the proximate cause (or partial cause) of Mr. Bates' car accident.\n\n\n                                                59\n\n                                                                                                MR 0565\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 61of61\n\n\n\n\n      Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n\nPlaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions [Doc. 180, 181). The court further DIRECTS\n\nMichelin to submit an unredacted copy of MNA 9234-9271 for the Court's in-\n\ncamera inspection. Finally, Plaintiffs may file a petition for reimbursement of\n\ntheir attorney's fees associated with their second request for sanctions pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 (b)(2)(C) within 15 days of this Order.

The Salinas family now seeks an order compelling production.\n\n2.     Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a party may request\n\nanother party to produce \"any designated documents.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 34(a)(l)(A). Ruic\n\n34 is balanced against Ruic 26, which provides that where information sought is alleged\n\nto be \"a trade secret or other co11fidcntial research, developtncnt, or collllnercial\n\ninformation,\" the court 1nay order either tl1at tl1e information \"not be revealed, or be\n\nrevealed only in a specified way.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)(l)(G). The official comments to\n\nRule 26 confirm that alleged trade secrets are entitled to only a very limited protection\n\nagainst discovery:\n\n       The courts have not givc11 trade secrets automatic and co1nplete immunity\n       against disclosure, hut have in each case wcig11ed their clalln to privacy\n       against the need for disclosure. Frequently they have been afforded a\n       li1nlted protection.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 26(c) cmt. In \"most eases the key issue is not whether the information\n\nwill be disclosed hut u11der what conditions, as the Suprc111e Court has recognized. The\n\nneed for t11e ii1fonnation is ordinarily held paramount but reasonable protective 1neasurcs\n\nare supplied to minimize the cffoct on the party making the disclosure.\" 8 Charles Alan\n\nWright, Arlher R.

First, the party seeking protection must establish that the\n      relevant information falls within the provision of this rule. Id. '\"[T]he\n      burden is upon [the party seeking the protective order] to show the\n      necessity of its issuance, which contemplates a particular and spcciJic\n      demonstration of fact as distinguished fi:o1n stereotyped and conclusory\n      statements.\"' Sanchez v.

However, under Texas law, it is well established that\n\n\"discovery about discovery\" is prohibited because it violates the work product privilege. In re\n\nExxon Corp., 208 S.W.3d 70 (Tex. App. '_ Beaumont 2006, orig. proceeding); In re Boxer\n\nProperty Management Corporation, 2009 WL 4250123 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2009,\n\norig. proceeding); In re Arpin America Moving Systems, LLC, 416 S. W.3d 927 (Tex. App. -\n\nDallas 2013, orig. proceeding). This question was squarely addressed by the Beaumont Court of\n\nAppeals:\n\n               the plaintiffs seek to depose an Exxon representative for the purpose of\n          inquiring specifically into the process by which Exxon's representative responded\n          to the requests for production. This subject necessarily and almost exclusively\n          concerns the 'mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or for\n          trial by or for a party or a party's representatives' and consists of the 'attorney's\n          representative's mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal theories'\n          subject to protection as work product and core work product.\n\nIn re Exxon Corp., 208 S.W.3d at 75.              The Houston Court of Appeals reached the same\n\nconclusion when considering a request to depose a corporate representative with knowledge of\n\n\"who searched for documents related to roof vents and roof hatches . . . which buildings were\n\nsearched; and the manner in which the search was conducted.\" In re Boxer, 2009 WL 4250123 at\n\n* 1. Citing Exxon, the court concluded that \"it is beyond dispute that the requested deposition\n\nwill explore attorney work product in connection with relators' efforts to respond to the Wells\n\nplaintiffs' discovery requests.\" Id. at *6. 1 Consequently, the Houston Court of Appeals ordered\n\nthe trial court to vacate its order compelling the deposition of the relators' corporate\n\nrepresentative.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The court further noted that \"bare assertions that an opponent is hiding documents\" do not justify deposing a\ncorporate representative about whether a diligent search was conducted. Id. at *7.\n\n                                                      2\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           MR 0759\n\f          Because Texas courts have clearly and consistently prohibited \"discovery about\n\ndiscovery,\" plaintiffs are not entitled to depose any MNA employee or representative about the\n\nefforts that were made to respond to their discovery requests in this case.\n\n                                     II.\n      NEWLY ENACTED §41.0115 OF TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE\n     ESTABLISHES PROCEDURE FOR DISCOVERY OF NET WORTH INFORMATION -\n       COURT SHOULD DELAY RULING UNTIL SUPREME COURT DETERMINES\n                 APPLICABILITY OF NEW LAW IN IN RE ROBINSON\n\nA.        Motion to Delay Ruling on Discovery of Net Worth Information\n\n          By enacting section 41.0115 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, the Texas\n\nlegislature amended the law regarding the pre-trial discovery of net worth information. Exh. A\n\n(CPRC §41.0115). By its terms, section 41.0115 applies to all cases that were filed on or after\n\nSeptember 1, 2015. Exh. B (Senate Bill 735) While this case was filed prior to September 1,\n\n2015, the Texas Supreme Court is currently considering whether section 41.0115 (the\n\ncodification of Senate Bill 735) should be applied to cases, like this one, that were filed prior to\n\nthe law's effective date.    Exh. C (Jn re Robinson, 2015 WL 5102928, Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus).       The parties have already submitted briefing on this issue and the matter was\n\nsubmitted for the Supreme Court's consideration on October 13, 2015. Exh. D (Docket Sheet).\n\nThe Supreme Court will almost certainly issue a ruling in In re Robinson during the pendency of\n\nthis lawsuit, most likely before the end of the year. MNA requests that this Court delay its ruling\n\non plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of a representative of MNA regarding its financial\n\nstatus until the Texas Supreme Court has issued its ruling in the In re Robinson matter.\n\nB.        Texas Legislature Recently Altered Standard for Discovery of Net Worth Information.\n\n          Since the Texas Supreme Court issued its opinion in Lunsford v. Morris in 1988, some\n\nTexas courts have permitted the discovery of a party's net worth based on nothing more than an\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0760\n\fallegation that punitive damages were appropriate. 746 S.W.2d 471. Here there is only a bare\n\nallegation of punitive damages and there are no facts to support such an award. Indeed, the facts\n\ndeveloped in discovery demonstrate that the conduct of a third party may be responsible for the\n\naccident, not the conduct of MNA. Because there are numerous legislative actions and court\n\nopinions limiting the recovery of exemplary damages since Lunsford was issued, this Court\n\nshould not allow discovery of punitive damages at all unless and until facts are developed to\n\nsupport them.\n\n          Trial courts have struggled with the proper procedures for managing the discovery of a\n\nparty's net worth in cases involving allegations of punitive damages. To clarify this issue, the\n\nTexas legislature added section 41.0115 to the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nannouncing a clear and concise procedure for courts to follow when a party's net worth is at\n\nissue. MNA contends that the procedure announced in section 41.0115 should govern plaintiffs'\n\nrequest for MNA's financial information in this case. Subsections (a) and (b) of section 41.0115\n\nrequire that, to obtain net worth information, a party must obtain a written order from the trial\n\ncourt finding that he has demonstrated a \"substantial likelihood of success\" on the merits of a\n\nclaim for punitive damages after a hearing on the issue:\n\n          (a) On the motion of a party and after notice and a hearing, a trial court may\n          authorize discovery of evidence of a defendant's net worth if the court finds in a\n          written order that the claimant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\n          success on the merits of a claim for exemplary damages. Evidence submitted by a\n          paiiy to the court in support of or in opposition to a motion made under this\n          subsection may be in the form of an affidavit or a response to discovery.\n\n          (b) If a trial court authorizes discovery under Subsection (a), the court's order may\n          only authorize use of the least burdensome method available to obtain the net\n          worth evidence.\n\nTEX. C1v. P. & REM. CODE §41.0115. Even when a plaintiff successfully shows a \"substantial\n\nlikelihood of success\" on a punitive damages claim, the court may only authorize the \"least\n\n\n                                                   4\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0761\n\fburdensome method available\" to obtain the net worth evidence.             Id.   Thus, if a party can\n\nproduce documents that demonstrate its net worth once a plaintiff has made the requisite\n\nshowing, it is highly unlikely that compelling the deposition of a representative with knowledge\n\nof a corporation's net worth would be found the \"least burdensome method available\" to\n\ndemonstrate net worth.\n\n          If the Supreme Court determines that section 41. 0115 is applicable to cases, like this one,\n\nthat were filed prior to September 1, 2015, plaintiffs' demand for the deposition of a\n\nrepresentative of MNA to testify regarding its financial condition is premature. Plaintiffs have\n\nnot followed the procedure established in section 41.0115 for obtaining discovery regarding\n\nMNA's net worth or even attempted to demonstrate a \"substantial likelihood of success\" on their\n\nclaim for punitive damages against MNA. Even if the plaintiffs could make such a showing,\n\nwhich is denied, demanding the deposition of a representative of MNA on its financial status\n\nwould not be the least burdensome method of obtaining MNA's net worth.\n\n                                   III.\n   DISCOVERY OF NET WORTH AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE\n  PERMITTED AT THIS POINT EVEN IF NEWLY ENACTED §41.0115 OF TEXAS CIVIL\n         PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS CASE\n\n          Even if the Supreme Court finds that section 41.0115 is not applicable to cases filed prior\n\nto September 1, 2015, plaintiffs should not be permitted to obtain discovery regarding MNA's\n\nnet worth or financial condition at this juncture.        The Texas Supreme Court established a\n\nbifurcated procedure for trials involving claims for exemplary damages due to the \"very real\n\npotential\" that evidence of a defendant's wealth will prejudice the jury's determination of other\n\ndisputed issues in tort cases. Transp. Inc. Co. v. Mariel, 879 S.W.2d 10, 30 (Tex. 1990). The\n\nTexas Legislature later codified that procedure in Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section\n\n41.009. Under the bifurcated procedure, evidence or mention of a defendant's net worth is\n\n\n                                                   5\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0762\n\fcompletely inadmissible during the first phase of a bifurcated trial.       In fact, evidence of a\n\ndefendant's net worth is only admissible in the second phase of a bifurcated trial following a\n\nunanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages, by clear and convincing evidence. TEX.\n\nClv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 41.003; 41.009 (emphasis added).\n\n          As a result of these challenging evidentiary hurdles, the majority of cases involving\n\npunitive damages do not make it to the second phase of trial. See In re Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d 35,\n\n50 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, orig. proceeding) (Sullivan, J., concurring). In such\n\ncases, information concerning a defendant's net worth is absolutely inadmissible and the\n\ndiscovery of such information is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible\n\nevidence.\n\n          Moreover, \"trial courts should be mindful of protecting sensitive information and utilize\n\nthe least intrusive means necessary to facilitate discovery.\" Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d at 46, citing In\n\nre Weekly Homes, L.P., 295 S.W.3d 309, 321 (Tex. 2009). That includes ensuring the correct\n\ntiming, as well as the correct scope, of discovery.      The discovery of net worth information\n\nsubjects defendants, like MNA, to extreme risk of prejudice, as well as unnecessary violations of\n\nprivacy through disclosure of highly sensitive, confidential financial information. The disclosure\n\nof such information will result in a grave risk to MNA and endanger MNA's ability to remain\n\nfinancially competitive in a highly competitive business environment. The Court should engage\n\nin a proper balancing of the burdens and benefits of discovery, particularly as colored by the\n\nimportance of the privacy interests at stake, and prohibit discovery of MNA's net worth unless\n\nand until it is determined that MNA is liable to plaintiffs for punitive damages.\n\n          WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, defendant Michelin North America, Inc.\n\nprays that this Court deny plaintiffs' motion to compel the depositions of representatives of\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0763\n\fMNA regarding (1) MNA's discovery responses and (2) MNA's financial condition. In the\n\nalternative, MNA requests that this Court delay its ruling on the motion to compel the deposition\n\nof a representative of MNA regarding its financial condition until the Texas Supreme Court has\n\nissued its ruling in In re Robinson.\n\n                                            Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                            GERMER BEAMAN & BROWN, P.L.L.C.\n                                            301 Congress Avenue, Suite 1700\n                                            Austin, Texas 78701\n                                            (512) 472-0288 Telephone\n                                            (512) 472-0721 Facsimile\n\n                                            By:    Isl Thomas M.

Plaintiff Nathan S. Ates, is the\nrepresentative of the Estate of Joyce A. Ates, who died as a result of the accident. Co-Plaintiffs Sonia Ates, and Nathan M.\nAtes (all plaintiffs referred to herein collectively as \"Ates\" ) are heirs of the Decedent. The helicopter was owned by\nHelicopter Services, Inc., and piloted by Christopher Yeager (\"Yeager\"). Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. (\"Robinson\")\nis the manufacturer of the helicopter, a 2007 Robinson R22 Beta II helicopter (the \"Aircraft\"). Plaintiffs and Real Party in\nInterest bring the current suit for damages arising out of the Accident, in several capacities. Ates sued Relator, Robinson\nHelicopter Company, Inc ., as the manufacturer of the Aircraft, Helicopter Services, Inc., as the owner of the Aircraft and the\npilot's employer, as well as the estate of the pilot, Christopher Yeager.\n\nRespondent:\n\nRespondent, Judge Mike D. Miller, (\"Respondent\") is the presiding judge of the 11th Judicial District Court of Harris\nCounty, Texas.\n\nActions from Which Realtor Seeks Relief:\n\nBased on Ates' claims for exemplary damages against Robinson, Ates seeks discovery of Robinson's net worth . Robinson\nobjected to such discovery based on *ix its \"good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\"\nAtes filed a Motion to Compel Discovery which was granted by the trial court. Robinson then filed a Motion for\nReconsideration and Motion for Limited Emergency Stay, both of which were denied by the trial court.

Did Respondent commit an abuse of discretion by misapplying applicable law and ordering the discovery of information\nrelating to Relator's net worth without a finding of liability for exemplary damages?\n\n2. Does Respondent's order requiring discovery of information relating to Relator's net worth constitute an error for which\nthere is no adequate remedy at law?\n\n                                               *1 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nHelicopter Services, Inc. is the owner of that certain 2007 Robinson R22 Beta Helicopter, Registration Number N28 I RG.\nChristopher Yeager (\"Yeager\") was an employee of Helicopter Services. On or about September 10, 2012, Yeager and Joyce\nA. Ates (\"Decedent\") were aboard the Aircraft departing from Baytown Airport. Approximately two hours in to the flight,\nthe Aircraft crashed. Yeager and Decedent died as a result of the injuries suffered in the Accident. (App. 5; ROl40).\n\nPlaintiffs and Real Party in Interest, Nathan S. Ates, Individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Joyce A.\nAtes, Deceased; Sonia Ates and Nathan M. Ates (collectively \"Ates\" and/or Plaintiffs) bring the current suit against Relator,\nRobinson Helicopter Company, Inc., as the manufacturer of the Aircraft, Helicopter Services, Inc., as the owner of the\nAircraft and the pilot's employer, as well as the estate of the pilot, Christopher Yeager. (ROOOl-0054; R0200-0228).\n\nAtes' Original Petition includes claims against Robinson alleging negligence in the design and manufacture of the Aircraft\nand defective design of the Aircraft. Ates also includes a vague claim of \"intentional\" conduct and \"willful, wonton and\nmalicious activities\" by Robinson. However, Ates fails to provide any factual support for their claims. (ROOO 1-0054;\nR0200-0228).\n\nIn connection with their Original Petition, Ates served Requests for Production of Documents, seeking the production of\nevidence to establish *2 Robinson's net worth. (ROOOl-0054). Due to the highly sensitive nature of the requested\ninformation, combined with the extreme risk of unfair prejudice, Robinson objected. (App. 5; R0140-0199; App. 6;\nR0246-0257). Ates filed a motion to compel Robinson's net worth, to which Robinson responded with this \"good faith\nargument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\" (App. 4; R0095-0136; App. 5; R0140-0199; App. 6;\nR0246-0257).\n\nPlaintiffs' motion was heard on May 11, 2015. On June 19, 2015, the Governor signed Senate Bill 735 into law, which\naddresses net worth discovery. (App. 8).\n\nRobinson filed a Supplemental Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel on June 26, 2015. (App. 6; R0246-0257).\nHowever, the trial court had previously entered an Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion, requiring Robinson to \"provide\ndocuments sufficient to establish the current net worth of Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc.\" on June 24, 2015. (App. l;\nR0244-0245).\n\nOn July 2, 2015, Robinson filed a Motion for Reconsideration based on the recent enactment of SB735. (App. 2;\nR0258-0270). On July 7, 2015, the trial court denied Robinson's Motion and ordered the requested documents produced by\n5:00 p.m. on July 8, 2015. (App. 3; R0271). Robinson's petition for writ of mandamus was filed in the Court of Appeals on\nJuly 8, 2015, and was subsequently denied on August 4, 2015. (App. 11). This petition for writ of mandamus follows.\n\n                                         *3 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe existing case law setting the standards for discovery ofa defendant's net worth is based on this Court's 1988 opinion in\nLunsford v. Morris. There have been substantial changes to exemplary damages law in the intervening years, both as a result\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                    MR 0774\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relator., 2015 WL 5102928 (2015)\n\n\n\nof this Court's subsequent opinions and as a result sweeping limitations on exemplary damage claims as passed by the Texas\nLegislature. Defendants such as Robinson should not be required to disclose its net worth based on a few conclusory,\nfactually devoid assertions in Ates' petition, which includes vague and factually unsupported claims of \"intentional\" conduct\nand \"wilful, wonton and malicious activities\" by Robinson but does not allege any particular design defect or act of\nnegligence. Without more, the discovery of Robinson's sensitive and confidential financial information should not be\npermitted. For cases pre-dating the effective date of SB735, this Court can give direction and guidance to trial courts by\nadopting the procedures of SB735 as the proper procedure for managing net worth discovery.\n\nFor years, Texas courts have recognized the lack of guidance and constancy in case law and statutes regarding the discovery\nof net worth evidence. The Legislature has repeatedly acted to tightly restrict the ability of litigants to seek and recover\nexemplary damages in the years following the decision in Lunsford. *4 However, the procedures of Texas courts have not\nevolved to keep up with these legislative changes.\n\nSB735 provides clarity and guidance for handling net worth discovery. SB735 requires a party seeking net worth discovery to\nfirst obtain an order from the trial court finding that there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a claim for\nexemplary damages. The provisions of SB735 are not effective until September 1, 2015 and are not binding on the present\ncase, leaving cases pre-dating SB735 with no guidance on net worth discovery. The current procedures are do not reflect the\nchanges made by the Legislature and need to be revisited.\n\nThus, while there is now clarity and direction in cases filed after September 1, 2015, it falls to this Court to clarify when and\nhow net worth discovery should be permitted in cases filed prior to September 1, 2015. Even applying the existing laws, the\ndiscovery of a defendant's net worth is improper absent a finding of liability for exemplary damages in a bifurcated trial.\nOtherwise, the discovery order exceeds the scope of permissible discovery as set out in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\nand violates the limitations on the availability of exemplary damages, as set out in Chapter 41.\n\nRobinson respectfully urges this Court to apply the procedures adopted in SB735 for cases filed before SB735 becomes\neffective. The Legislature has clearly indicated what it considers to be the proper procedures involving net worth *5\ndiscovery. Accordingly, Robinson respectfully requests that the trial court be required to hold a \"gatekeeper\" hearing, after an\nadequate time for discovery has passed, as envisioned by SB735 to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is\na substantial likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages.\n\nAlternatively, Robinson requests that this Court order the trial court to conduct discovery within the limitations of the\nexisting provisions of Chapter 41 and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Only upon a finding of liability during phase one\nof a bifurcated trial does evidence of a defendant's net worth become relevant and admissible and therefore that is the only\ncircumstance in which disclosure of a defendant's net worth should be compelled.\n\n\n\n                                                         ARGUMENT\n\n\nII. RESPONDENT'S ERRONEOUS MISAPPLICATION OF THE LAWS GOVERNING NET WORTH\nDISCOVERY CONSTITUTES A CLEAR ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\n\nA. STAND ARD OF REVIEW FOR ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion if it acts in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or without reference to guiding rules and\nprinciples. Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 839 (Tex. 1992). When determining legal principles, a trial court has no\ndiscretion to misinterpret or misapply the law. Id. at 840. Thus, a clear failure to analyze or correctly apply the law\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion. Id.; see e.g., *6 In re Essex Ins., 450 S.W.3d 524, 525-26 (Tex. 2014). A trial court's\nerroneous legal conclusion is an abuse of discretion, even if the law is unsettled. Huie v. DeShazo, 922 S. W.2d 920, 927-28\n(Tex. 1996). Under certain circumstances, a trial court's action can constitute an abuse of discretion even though it is\nconsistent with existing jurisprudence, but where the action conflicts with what the current law ought to be. In re Columbia\nMed. Ctr. of las Colinas, 290 S.W.3d 204, 213 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding).\n\n         Nx                                   N<    ', • r'   <   11        ,, , / r• , • 1   vc.•v . .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                        MR 0775\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relater., 2015 WL 5102928 (2015)\n\n\n\n\nB. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED A CLEAR AND CONCISE PROCEDURE FOR NET WORTH\nDISCOVERY IN TEXAS.\n\n\na. Senate Bill 735 answers the judicial pleas for clarification of procedure regarding the discoverability of a party's\nnet worth in cases involving exemplary damages.\n\nSince this Court's 1988 holding in Lunsford v. Morris, (746 S.W.2d 471 (Tex. 1988) (orig. proceeding)), trial courts have\nstruggled with the proper procedures for managing the discovery of a party's net worth in cases involving exemplary\ndamages. This is particularly true in light of the extensive changes made by the Legislature in the years since Lunsford. The\nprocedures employed by the courts have not evolved to reflect the legislative changes. The Legislature has responded to the\njudicial pleas for clarification by setting out a clear and concise procedure for the courts to follow in cases where a party's net\nworth is in issue by enacting Senate Bill 735. However, for cases pre-dating the effective date of *7 SB735, the struggle\nremains. It is within the authority of this Court to clarify the procedures for cases pre-dating SB735, including the present\ncase. There should be but one consistent procedure for addressing net worth discovery in all cases, present and future.\n\nSB735 requires parties seeking net worth discovery to obtain a written order from the trial court finding, \"the claimant has\ndemonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a claim for exemplary damages.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode Section 41.0115. (App. 8). SB735 also provides said hearing should only be held after an adequate time for the\ndiscovery of facts relating to exemplary damages has been made. (App. 8).\n\nGiven the recognized need to clarify the appropriate procedures for discovery of net worth evidence, and the dramatic\nchanges in punitive damages law over the last thirty years, Robinson respectfully urges this Court to provide the much\nneeded guidance to the lower courts and adopt the procedures of SB735 for the discovery of a defendant's net worth, even in\ncases pre-dating SB735. More specifically, Robinson respectfully requests that the trial court be required to hold a\n\"gatekeeper\" hearing, as envisioned by SB735 to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is a substantial\nlikelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages against Robinson.\n\n\n\n*8 b. Texas Law regarding exemplary damages has changed substantially, and the courts need clear guidance from\nthis Court on the procedures for addressing net worth discovery.\n\nIn 1988, this Court held that a defendant's net worth is relevant in a suit involving exemplary damages. Lumford, 746\nS.W.2d at 473. As a result, parties may discover and offer evidence of a defendant's net worth in cases where exemplary\ndamages may be awarded. Id. In 1995, the Legislature passed sweeping tort reform to the substantive and procedural law\ngoverning exemplary damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§§ 41.001-.013. Chapter 41 was significantly rewritten to\nprovide defendants dramatic protection from exemplary-damage awards. Such changes include:\n•Exemplary damages were limited to assessing damages with the purpose of punishing the defendant.\n\n• Chapter 41 's coverage was expanded to apply to all but a very few types of tort actions.\n\n• A plaintiffs burden of proof for exemplary damages was elevated to clear and convincing evidence.\n\n• With few limitations, a defendant could no longer be exposed to exemplary damages because of another person's criminal\nact.\n\n•The Legislature lowered the existing cap on exemplary damages.\n\n• Upon a defendant' s motion, the trial court had to bifurcate the jury's determination of the amount of exemplary damages,\nand evidence of a *9 defendant' s net worth could not be admitted during the liability phase of the trial. Id.\n\n\n\n\\\\ ' [, ' Next If:) 2015   rI 1orn ·,.,n Reutl:'!rS. Ne c1a11n to ono1m~I U   Gover nmenl Wori\\s.                               (\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                          MR 0776\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relater., 2015 WL 5102928 (2015)\n\n\n\nThese substantive and procedural amendments changed the legal landscape on two levels. First, they further limited the\namount of exemplary damages that could be assessed. See id. § 1 secs. 41.007, 41.008. Second, and more significantly, these\nrevisions dramatically lessened the chances of any exemplary-damage recovery by a claimant. See id. § I §§ 41.001(5),\n41.002, 41.003(b), 41.005 .\n\nIn 2003, the Legislature further eroded a plaintiffs ability to recover exemplary damages. Now, unlike the general rule\npermitting a civil verdict upon the vote of only ten jurors, an award of exemplary damages requires a unanimous verdict as to\nliability for, and the amount of, such damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 4 l .003(d); Tex. R. Civ. P. 292; DeAtley v.\nRodriguez, 246 S.W.3d 848, 850 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\nThe current procedures are \"decades-old [and] do not reflect the changes made by the Legislature and, in light of the\nevolution of Texas law, and needs to be revisited.\" See In re Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d 35, 50 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.]\n2009, pet. denied) (orig. proceeding) (Sullivan, J., concurring). In 1998, Justice Gonzalez recognized the difficulty which\nresulted from the lack of direction regarding discovery of net worth information. \"These issues are significant and demand\nthe Court's attention.\" In re Jerry 's Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., 977 S.W.2d 565, 566 (Tex. 1998) (Gonzalez, J., dissenting).\n\n*10 This Court was willing to address these issues previously. Id. This Court granted petitions for writ of mandamus in\nAramark Uniform Services, Inc. v. Tyson, 40 Tex. Sup. J. 84 (November 15, 1996), and Perry Home Contractors, Inc. v.\nPatterson, 39 Tex. Sup. J. 237 (February 9, 1996), to determine whether a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of\nentitlement to exemplary damages before discovering evidence of a defendant's net worth. However, this Court was unable to\nclarify net worth discovery because each of those cases were settled. Perry Home Contractors, Inc. v. Patterson, 40 Tex. Sup.\nJ. 398 (March 6, 1997); Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc. v. Tyson, 40 Tex. Sup. J. 131 (December 13, 1996). In the years since,\nthe need to address these issues has grown due to the statutory changes in punitive damages made by the Legislature.\n\nUndeniably, the Legislature has repeatedly acted to tightly restrict the ability of litigants to seek and recover exemplary\ndamages . Robinson respectfully requests this Court harmonize net worth discovery in cases pre-dating SB735 with the\nchanges made to punitive damages law following Lunsford.\n\nIn light of the legislative changes limiting the availability of exemplary damages, similarly limiting net worth discovery to\ncases where a finding of liability has actually been made, both plaintiffs and defendants can be protected and neither party is\nunfairly prejudiced by an unrestricted requirement to disclose sensitive, yet completely irrelevant information. Discovery of\nRobinson's net *11 worth, as well as that of similarly situated defendants, should only be permitted following a finding by\nthe trial court that there is a substantial likelihood of success on a plaintiffs claim for exemplary damages, as set out in\nSB735.\n\n\n\nC. EVEN APPLYING THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICES & REMEDIES CODE,\nNET WORTH DISCOVERY IS IMPROPER ABSENT A FINDING OF LIABILITY FOR EXEMPLARY\nDAMAGES.\n\nThis Court established a bifurcated procedure for trials involving claims for exemplary damages due to the \"very real\npotential\" that evidence of a defendant's wealth will prejudice the jury's determination of other disputed issues in tort cases.\nTransp. Inc. Co. v. Morie!, 879 S. W.2d 10, 30 (Tex. 1990). That procedure was later codified by the Legislature. See Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.009. Under the bifurcated procedure, evidence or mention of a defendant's net worth is\ncompletely inadmissible during the first phase of a bifurcated trial. In fact, evidence of a defendant's net worth is only\nadmissible in the second phase of a bifurcated trial following a unanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages, by\nclear and convincing evidence. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem . Code§§ 41.003; 41 .009 [emphasis added] .\n\nAs a result of these difficult evidentiary hurdles, most cases involving exemplary damages never make it to the second phase\nof trial. See In re Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d at 50 (Sullivan, J., concurring). In such cases, information concerning *12 a\ndefendant's net worth is absolutely inadmissible and the discovery thereof is not reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Additionally, the discovery of net worth information subjects defendants, such as\nRobinson, to extreme risk of prejudice, as well as unnecessary violations of privacy through disclosure of highly sensitive,\nconfidential financial information. The disclosure of such information will most likely result in a grave risk to Robinson and\n\n'//;o· tlii:.Nex:t © 2015 l homson Reuters. No ciairn to or1g1nal US.

Thus,\ninformation concerning Robinson's net worth should not be discoverable unless and until the jury finds that Robinson is\nliable to Ates for exemplary damages.\n\n\n\na. The Pre-Trial Discovery of Net Worth Evidence Exceeds the Scope of Permissible Discovery in Bifurcated Trials.\n\nIn the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the trier of fact shall determine: ( 1) liability for compensatory and exemplary damages;\nand (2) the amount of compensatory damages. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.009. If liability for exemplary damages is\nestablished during the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the trier of fact shall, in the second phase, determine the amount of\nexemplary damages to be awarded, if any. Id. The second phase is only necessary after the fact finder has found, by\nunanimous verdict, that a defendant is liable for exemplary damages. Due to the extremely prejudicial impact, a party cannot\neven mention a defendant's net worth in the first phase of a bifurcated trial. *13 Consequently, the discovery of Robinson's\nnet worth is absolutely irrelevant and inadmissible in the first phase of trial. If, and only if, a jury determines Robinson is\nliable for exemplary damages can evidence of Robinson ' s net worth be introduced during the second phase. Robinson should\nnot be required to produce evidence of its net worth unless and until the jury returns such a verdict.\n\nWhile the scope of discovery is quite broad, it is nevertheless confined by the subject matter of the case and reasonable\nexpectations ofobtaining information that will aid resolution of the dispute. Tex R. Civ P. 192 cmt. 1; Jn re CSX Corp., 124\nS.W.3d 149, 152 (Tex. 2003). Therefore, discovery requests must be reasonably tailored to include only matters relevant to\nthe proceedings. In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711, 713 (Tex. 1998) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam). The disclosure\nof Robinson's net worth is relevant only to the amount of exemplary damages that may be awarded. See Wal-Mart Stores v.\nAlexander, 868 S.W.2d 322. 329 {Tex. 1993) (Gonzalez, J., concurring). More importantly, in bifurcated trials, that\ninformation is not relevant during the first phase because the fact finder cannot determine the amount of exemplary damages\nto be awarded. Evidence of a defendant's net worth is only admissible, and therefore, only relevant, in the second phase\nfollowing the highly unlikely finding ofliability for exemplary damages.\n\n*14 To establish a defendant's liability for exemplary damages, a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence each\nelement of its exemplary damages claim. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 41.003(b). This is a higher burden of proof than that\nrequired for mere negligence and the recovery of compensatory damages. See Al Parker Buick Co. v. Touchy, 788 S.W.2d\n129, 130 {Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ). Additionally, exemplary damages may only be awarded if the jury\nwas unanimous in regard to finding liability for and the amount of exemplary damages. Id. at§ 41.003(d). Thus, the question\nis not if this evidence is relevant, but when it is relevant. Lunsford, 746 S. W.2d at 4 74 (Gonzalez, J., dissenting). In most\ncases, the answer to that question is never.\n\nThe Legislative changes made following Lunsford reduced the amount of exemplary damages that could be awarded, but\nmore significantly, dramatically reduced the chances of any exemplary damage recovery. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§§ 41.001, et seq.; In re Jacobs, 300 S. W .3d at 50. As a result, discovery of a defendant's net worth is both irrelevant and\ninadmissible in most cases. The disclosure of a defendant's sensitive and confidential financial information is unwarranted\nand unnecessary unless and until a finding of liability for exemplary damages has been made. Consequently, the pre-trial\ndiscovery of such information exceeds the scope of discovery permitted under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and should\nnot be allowed. Thus, Robinson should not be *15 compelled to disclose confidential financial information unless and until a\nunanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages has been made by the jury during the trial of this cause.\n\nIf, and only if, the jury determines that a defendant is liable for exemplary damages, should a defendant be compelled to\ndisclose its net worth. That disclosure may be made by either providing bottom-line number of a defendant's total net worth,\nor by only producing evidence necessary to demonstrate its ability to satisfy an award up the maximum amount of exemplary\ndamages that may be awarded pursuant to Chapter 41.\n\n\n\nII.

STANDARD OF REVIEW FOR ADEQUACY OF APPELLATE REMEDY.\n\nThe second requirement for mandamus is lack of an adequate remedy by appeal. Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 839-40. The\nadequacy inquiry \"is simply a proxy for the careful balance of jurisprudential considerations that determine when appellate\ncourts will use original mandamus proceedings to review the action of lower courts.\" In re Prudential Ins. Co., 148 S.W.3d\n124, 136 (Tex. 1999). Determining whether an appellate remedy is adequate involves balancing \"practical and prudential\"\nconsiderations, such as the impairment of important substantive and procedural rights, the opportunity to give direction and\nguidance on the law that would otherwise be lost, and the waste of judicial resources on a *16 proceeding. See In re Essex,\n450 S.W.3d at 528; Tn re Prudential, 148 S.W.3d at 136.\n\nA party has no adequate remedy by appeal to challenge a discovery dispute if the appellate court will not be able to cure the\ntrial court's error. See Walker, 827 S.W.2d at 843; see, e.g., Volkswagen, A.G. v. Valdez, 909 S.W.2d 900, 903 (Tex. 1995).\nAdditionally, a party has no adequate remedy by appeal when the trial court's refusal to grant the remedy renders the subject\nmatter of the appeal illusory. See e.g., In re ATU Ins., 148 S.W.3d 109, 115-17 (Tex. 2004); In re Dickason, 987 S.W.2d 570,\n571 (Tex. 1998).\n\nFurther, mandamus is an \"extraordinary remedy, not issued as a matter of right, but at the discretion of the court.\" In re\nPrudential, 148 S.W.3d at 138. \"Mandamus review of significant rulings in exceptional cases may be essential to preserve\nimportant substantive and procedural rights from impairment or loss ... \" Id. at 136. Additionally, mandamus is a proper\nvehicle for courts to correct blatant injustice that otherwise would elude review by the appellate courts. See Jn re Prudential,\n148 S.W.3d at 138; In re Reece, 341 S.W.3d 360, 374 (Tex. 2011).\n\n\n\nB. RESPONDENT'S ABUSE OF DISCRETION CANNOT BE REMEDIED BY APPEAL.\n\nMandamus review is generally a matter within this Court's discretion. In re McAllen Med. Ctr., Inc., 257 S.W.3d 458, 461\n(Tex. 2008). Mandamus relief is frequently issued when \"the very act of proceeding to trial - regardless of the * 17 outcome -\nwould defeat the substantive right involved.\" Id. at 465; In re Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc., 392 S.W.3d 861, 867 (Tex. App. -\nTexarkana 2013, no pet.) (orig. proceeding). Generally, the scope of discovery is within the trial court's discretion, but the\ntrial court must make an effort to impose reasonable discovery limits. In re Graco Children's Prods., Inc., 210 S.W.3d 598,\n600 (Tex. 2006) (per curiam). An order that compels overly broad discovery is an abuse of discretion for which mandamus is\nthe proper remedy. Id.; Jn re Deere & Co., 299 S.W.3d 819, 820 (Tex. 2009).\n\nMandamus relief is available when the trial court compels production beyond the permissible bounds of discovery. See Jn re\nAm. Optical Corp., 988 S. W.2d at 714. Intrusive discovery measures - such as the unproven right to discovery of net worth\ninformation - require, at a minimum, that the benefits of the discovery measure outweigh the burden imposed upon the\ndiscovered party. See In re Prudential, 148 S. W .3d at 135-36. \"If an appellate court cannot remedy a trial court's discovery\nerror, then an adequate appellate remedy does not exist.\" In re Dana Corp., 138 S.W .3d 298, 301 (Tex. 2004). After a private\ndocument, such as that demonstrating Robinson's net worth, has been produced, inspected, and examined, a holding that the\ncourt had erroneously issued the order would be of small comfort to a relator in protecting its privacy. See Walker, 827\nS.W.2d at 843.\n\n*18 In the present case, the unnecessary discovery of Robinson's net worth constitutes an invasion of privacy and subjects\nRobinson to the potential for unfair prejudice and abuse. Once the information is disclosed, the damage to Robinson cannot\nbe undone. The benefits to unlimited discovery of such information do not outweigh the risks and burdens imposed upon\nRobinson, or other similarly situated defendants. It will be impossible to undo the harm to Robinson once the documents are\ndisclosed. Conversely, following the procedures clearly set out in SB735 in cases pre-dating its effective date, raises no risk\nof prejudice or harm to Ates, or other plaintiffs seeking exemplary damages.\n\nAn order may constitute an abuse of discretion if it compels discovery of matters not relevant to the subject matter of the\naction. In re Graco, 210 S.W.3d at 600; In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d at 713. Discovery of a defendant's net worth\ninformation is not relevant to the present case unless and until the trial court, following an evidentiary hearing, determines\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages . Robinson\nurges this Court to adopt the requirements of the recently enacted SB735 in cases pre-dating the effective date of SB735.\n\n'1'.t\"' I \" Next \\C120 15 Thorn on Reuters No claim Lo original U.S Gow::1 rm1ent Works.                                     10\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                        MR 0779\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relater., 2015 WL 5102928 (2015)\n\n\n\nDelaying the production of Robinson's net worth information until a finding of a substantial likelihood of success is made\nwill have no effect on the pre-trial proceedings in the present case, nor those involving similarly situated defendants.\n\n*19 The premature disclosure of Robinson's net worth information would cause irreparable and irreversible injury to\nRobinson. Once Robinson's net worth information is disclosed, the harm and prejudice resulting from that disclosure cannot\nbe undone. Conversely, there will be no harm or prejudice of any kind to Plaintiffs if the net worth information is not\nprovided absent a finding of likelihood of success.\n\nRobinson is not publicly-traded and has always been a closely-held corporation. (App. 5; R0140-0199, Exhibit \"A\").\nRobinson has always treated such financial information as carefully guarded trade-secrets. Id. The disclosure of Robinson' s\nfinancial information would gravely impair and endanger Robinson's ability to remain competitive in a highly regulated and\ncompetitive business environment. Id. As a result, Robinson is entitled to the mandamus relief requested.\n\n\n\n                                                            PRAYER\nFor the foregoing reasons, Relator, Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. respectfully requests that this Court grant Robinson's\npetition for writ of mandamus and order Respondent to vacate its order granting Real Parties in Interest's motion to compel\nthe discovery of Robinson's net worth. Robinson further requests that this Court direct the trial court to hold a \"gatekeeper\"\nhearing to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is a substantial *20 likelihood that they will succeed on the\nmerits of their claim for exemplary damages against Robinson, or alternatively, defer the discovery of net worth evidence\nuntil the conclusion of the first phase of bifurcated trial, and then only in the event the first phase jury's verdict would permit\na second phase of trial. Robinson further requests any and all other relief, in law or in equity, to which it is justly entitled.\nNone of the reliefrequested by Robinson will result in prejudice to any party in any respect.\n\n\n\nAppendix not available.\nEull of Document                                                     .,. 2015 J'hr1111s1n1 J{cutt:r:;, No claim to r>riginal U.S. Government Works .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                               4 1\n                                                                                                                                               I l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                         MR 0780\n\fIN RE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., 15-0604 (2015)\n\n\n\n\n            TO ORDER COPIES OF ANY DOCUMENTS LISTED BELOW, CALL WESTLAW\n                                     COURTEXPRESS\n                  1-877-DOC-RETR (1-877-362-7387) (Additional Charges Apply)\n\n                           This docket is current through 10/18/2015\n\nCurrent Date: 10/26/2015\nSource:        SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS, TEXAS\nCASE INFORMATION\nCase Title:                         IN RE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC.\n\nCourt:                              SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n\nCase Number:                        15-0604\n\nCase Type:                          APPEALS\n\nCase Subtype:                       PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n\nKey Nature of Suit:                 CIVIL PROCEDURE; PETITION (100.55)\n\nDate Filed:                         08/12/2015\n\n\n\n\nLOWER COURT INFORMATION\nTrial Court:                        11TH DISTRICT COURT\n\nTrial Court County:                 HARRIS\n\nTrial Court Judge:                  MICHAEL DAVID MILLER\n\nTrial Court Case Number:            2014-34635\n\n\n\n\nPARTICIPANT INFORMATION\n!ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC.\nType:                               RELATOR\n\nAttorney:                           CARRIE M.

Michelin's reliance on In re Exxon Corp:., 208 S.W.3d 70, 76 (Tex. App. 2006) is a non-\n   starter: the witness compelled to testify in Exxon was an attorney.\n\n       Michelin should re-read Plaintiffs' Motion. Plaintiffs have no interest in deposing any\n\nlawyers or attorneys of record. Michelin's justification for not producing an employee most\n\nknowledgeable about its responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Production is In re Exxon Corp.,\n\n208 S.W.3d 70, 76 (Tex. App. 2006). Exxon has nothing to do with the present circumstances.\n\nIn Exxon, the plaintiffs sought to depose \"one of Exxon's attorneys\":\n\n      It cannot reasonably be argued in this Court that the anticipated deponent is\n      not one of Exxon's attorneys. During the June hearing, plaintiffs' counsel\n      informed the trial court that he suspected the knowledgeable representative was\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0785\n\f        indeed an Exxon lawyer and Exxon confirmed with the trial court that counsel\n        responded to the requests for production.\n\nId. (e.a.).\n\n        While the trial court compelled the discovery deposition of the attorney involved in the\nlitigation, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \"[c]ompelling an attorney of record\ninvolved in the litigation of the case ... implicates work product concerns and is inappropriate\":\n\n        Compelling an attorney of record involved in the litigation of the case to\n        testify concerning the suit's subject matter generally implicates work product\n        concerns and is inappropriate under most circumstances.\n                                              *****\n       This inquiry is designed to inquire into mental processes of counsel and is not\n       reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\n\nId. (e.a.).\n\n        Again, here, Plaintiffs have no interest in deposing any lawyers, attorneys of record and\n\ndiscovering the mental processes of counsel concerning this issue.   What Plaintiffs want and are\n\nentitled to depose is the Michelin employee or employees - not lawyer or attorney - most\n\nknowledgeable about Michelin's responsive documents to Plaintiffs' Request for Production.\n\nSuch folks include but are not limited to the tire builders, tire designers, tire verifiers,\n\nclassspectors, return center personnel, tire adjustment data employees, etc., etc. For example, in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' Request for all aspect specifications, Michelin claimed that only nine (9)\n\naspect specifications apply to the components and conditions at issue.          Only a Michelin\n\nemployee who uses the aspect specifications daily within a Michelin production plant- not an\n\nattorney - can determine which aspect specifications correspond to specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, Plaintiffs' Motion should be granted.\n\nII. In cases like this where \"punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded, parties may\n    discover and offer evidence of a defendant's net worth.\" Lunsford v. Morris, 746 S.W.2d\n    471, 473 (Tex. 1988). (e.a.).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0786\n\f        To date, there is overwhelming evidence of manufacturing and design defects in the\n\nsubject tire- all known to Michelin before, during and after the tire was manufactured. Michelin\n\nprovides no evidence disputing such.        See Plaintiff's Original Petition and Objection to\n\nMichelin's Renewed Designation re: Adrian and Maria Rico.           Therefore, this case reeks of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n       Still, Michelin's reliance on Section 41.0115 of the Texas Civil Practice & Civil\n\nRemedies Code is misleading. As Michelin concedes, said statute does not apply to cases\n\nthat were filed prior to September 1, 2015. On the contrary, binding Texas law requires and\n\nauthorizes discovery of a defendant like Michelin's net worth when a plaintiff, like here, seeks\n\npunitive damages:\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court has held that in cases in which punitive or exemplary\n       damages may be awarded, parties may discover and offer evidence of a\n       defendant's net worth. [Citation omitted].\n\n      The court declared a defendant's net worth to be \"relevant\" in a suit involving\n      exemplary damages. Id. Miller seeks punitive damages, which are recoverable\n      for a willful breach of a fiduciary duty . . . Thus, documents showing the net\n      wo1ih of Gann and Perdue are relevant and discoverable.\n\nMiller v. O'Neill, 775 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex. App. 1989). (e.a.).\n\n       Michelin's only argument is to have this Court \"delay\" its ruling and discovery and\n\nconsequently continue trial, which would directly violate an express order of this Court:\n\n      Judge want to let you all know that ... there will be no more continuances.\n\nE-Mail from Francine Ly, Judge Dale Tillery's 1341'1 Court Coordinator, Exhibit A. (e.a.).\n\nConclusion: Pursuant to binding Texas precedent, Plaintiffs are entitled to: 1) depose Michelin's\n\nemployee or employees - not lawyers or attorneys - about Michelin's responses to Plaintiffs'\n\nRequest for Production and 2) conduct discovery about Michelin's net worth including the\n\ndeposition of its employee most knowledgeable about these matters.\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0787\n\f                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                            LAW OFFICES OF LUIS P.

No tires in the relevant scope were manufactured\n\nwith nylon cap plies. MNA objects to this request as being vague and ambiguous in its use of the\n\nterm \"nylon cap pules\" and \"similar tires,\" as those tem1s are undefined.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the relevant scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\narc neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action.\n\nTHIRD SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:\n\n          After a reasonable and diligent search, MNA has not located any documents responsive\n\nto this request for tires in the expanded scope.          No tires in the expanded scope were\n\nmanufactured with nylon cap plies. MNA objects to this request as being vague and ambiguous\n\nin its use of the term \"nylon cap pules\" and \"similar tires,\" as those terms arc undefined.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the expanded scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\nare neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action.\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 19:\n\n        Identify and produce any and all documents, relating to the building, tire builder training,\ntesting, and inspection of passenger and light truck tires at the Dothan, Alabama plant where the\n\n                                                23\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0797\n\fsubject tire was manufactured. This request includes, but is not limited to standard practice\nbinders, tire building mmrnals, tire builder training manuals, equipment manuals, and/or other\nmaterials and videotapes used to train tire builders. This request also includes documents,\nphotographs, and charts used to illustrate defects, or potential defects, in tires and/or problems or\npotential problems in the tire building process.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n          MNA objects to this request because plaintiffs have not identified the specific design or\n\nmanufacturing process that produced the defect alleged to be present in the tire in question.\n\nAccordingly, this request is nothing more than an impermissible \"fishing expedition\" for\n\ninformation generally related to every aspect of MNA's design and manufacturing process,\n\nwhether or not related to plaintiffs' claims in this case. If plaintiffs will identify the components\n\nand processes at issue in this case, MNA will search for and produce documents responsive to\n\nthis request for those components and processes during the relevant scope, if they exist.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the relevant scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\nare neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire and time period relevant to this action.\n\n          MNA further objects to the extent this request seeks or attempts to seek information that\n\nconstitutes commercially sensitive, confidential business infonnation of MNA. Pursuant to Rule\n\n507 of the Texas Rules of Evidence, MNA asserts trade secret protection for such information.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:\n\n          MNA incorporates its objections above in its original response.           Subject to the\n\nconfidentiality protective order entered in this case, MNA produces MNA-MEDINA-0001287 -\n\nMNA-MEDINA-0001312 and MNA-MEDINA-0001815 - MNA-MEDINA-0001820 for the\n\nrelevant scope or the oldest available for the components and processes identified by plaintiffs.\n\n                                                24\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0798\n\fMNA has located no additional responsive documents for the relevant scope for the components\n\nand processes identified by plaintiffs.\n\nTHIRD SUPPLEMENT AL RESPONSE:\n\n          MNA incorporates its objections above in its original response.          Subject to the\n\nconfidentiality protective order entered in this case, on September 11, 2015 MNA produced\n\nMNA-MEDINA-0003362 - MNA-MEDINA0003515, the oldest documents available for the\n\nexpanded scope for the components and processes identified by plaintiffs. MNA has located no\n\nadditional responsive documents for the expanded scope for the components and processes\n\nidentified by plaintiffs.\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 20:\n\n        Identify and produce any audits, reports, examinations, investigations, studies, or\nreviews, including any work papers, whether created within or outside Michelin North America,\nin any manner related to the return, failure, performance, durability, and life expectancy, design,\nor quality of the subject tire and model tires.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n          MNA produces claims fom1s for the model of the tire in question manufactured at Dothan\n\nduring the relevant scope as MNA-MEDINA-0000011 - MNA-MEDINA-0000130, MNA-\n\nMEDINA-0000260 - MNA-MEDINA-0000563, and MNA-MEDINA-0000231. Upon entry of\n\nan appropriate confidentiality protective order, MNA will search for and produce claim forms for\n\nthe tires common green to the tire in question manufactured at Dothan during the relevant scope.\n\nAlso upon entry of an appropriate confidentiality protective order, MNA will produce a list of\n\nadjustment codes. To the extent plaintiffs identify codes relevant to the condition of the tire in\n\nquestion and plaintiffs' claims in this matter, MNA will produce documents reflecting the\n\nnumber of tires in the relevant scope returned with those conditions, if any.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0799\n\f                                                                               AUSTIN BEAUMONT HOUSTON\n                                                                                            WWW germer.com\n\n                                                                                    THOMAS M.

He\n\nlost control of the vehicle, it rolled over, and the plaintiff occupants were injured. Mr. Rico had\n\npurchased the Expedition approximately two months before the accident and had not checked or\n\nchanged the tires. In fact, the vehicle had mis-matched tires of varying sizes, some of which were\n\npassenger tires, and one was a light truck tire. The tire at issue is a passenger tire, a P255/70R 16\n\nLTX M/S manufactured at MNA’s Dothan, Alabama plant during the 31st week of 2001. At the\n\ntime of the accident, it was over eleven years old and should not have been in service.\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 1\n                                                                                                        MR 0811\n\f          Plaintiffs moved to compel certain documents from MNA and multiple oral hearings\n\nwere held on September 8, October 5, and November 3, 2015 on the following motions, among\n\nothers:\n\n              •   Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Compel Michelin to Respond to Discovery and\n                  Identification of Withheld Michelin Documents, and\n\n              •   Plaintiffs’ Short Motion to Compel Michelin’s Employee Most Knowledgeable\n                  about: 1) Michelin’s Discovery Reponses and 2) Financial Information of\n                  Michelin North America (MNA).\n\n          In an Order dated November 11, 2015, this Court signed plaintiffs’ proposed order on\n\ntheir Motion to Compel Michelin to Respond to Discovery, and required that confidential, trade\n\nsecret aspect specifications be produced on or before November 24, 2015. The Court also\n\nexpanded the scope of discovery to dissimilar tires from the tire at issue. The Court has not yet\n\nsigned an order on the second motion listed above regarding “discovery on discovery” or on\n\nMNA’s financial information.       Although certain rulings were made from the bench at the\n\nNovember 3 hearing, the hearing transcript has not yet been provided by the court reporter.\n\n                                             II.\n                         MNA’s Aspect Specifications are Trade Secret\n\n          The November 11 Order compels MNA to produce “the oldest version of all aspect\n\nspecifications.” The Order is expansive in that it is not limited to the Dothan plant, where the\n\ntire at issue was manufactured, nor is it related to plaintiffs’ specific defect theories. The aspect\n\nspecifications regarding the tire defects that plaintiffs allege in this case have been voluntarily\n\nproduced by MNA in an attempt at compromise, but plaintiffs insist that they need all of such\n\nproprietary documents, even on unrelated defects. All such aspect specifications were proven up\n\nas trade secret in the Affidavit of Vaneaton Price where he testified:\n\n          Certain of Plaintiffs’ requests seek MNA’s design and manufacturing\n          specifications, specification changes, testing and design related documents,\n          research and development, tire adjustment processes and analysis, internal\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 2\n\n                                                                                               MR 0812\n\f       research and studies, proprietary manufacturing and inspection processes and\n       procedures, and tire production information. All such documents are highly\n       protected trade secrets of MNA.\n\n(V. Price Aff., ¶ 43, emphasis added)         Additionally, Mr. Price testified by affidavit that\n\n“Plaintiffs have also requested information and documents relating to MNA’s manufacturing and\n\nquality procedures,” and he described the trade secret nature of such documents, the steps taken\n\nby MNA to protect their secrecy, and the competitive disadvantage to MNA from disclosure. Id.\n\nat ¶¶ 55-60.\n\n       This affidavit testimony encompasses the “aspect specifications” ordered to be produced\n\nin the November 11 Order. They fall within “MNA’s proprietary inspection processes and\n\nprocedures” and “quality procedures” referenced in the affidavit quoted above. To explain\n\nfurther, “aspect specifications” are procedures by which MNA classpectors inspect finished tires\n\npursuant to certain quality assurance protocols to look for certain characteristics in the tires after\n\nthey have been cured. Thus, they are part of the proprietary quality assurance systems and\n\nprocesses developed by MNA. There are hundreds of aspect specifications. MNA has clarified\n\nthis point in the Supplemental Affidavit of Vaneaton Price attached hereto as Exhibit A. The\n\nNovember 11 Order requires such production of these confidential trade secrets of MNA.\n\n       This Court allowed plaintiffs to depose Mr. Price about his affidavit and his deposition\n\nwas recently taken. He explained that MNA’s aspect specifications are marked “D3” indicating\n\nconfidential documents within MNA that are not allowed outside the company. (Depo. at 79-80)\n\nPlaintiffs counsel repeatedly chastised Mr. Price for MNA’s “thought-out, premeditated actions\n\nto protect its secrets” and for “keeping information secret and away from the public,” including\n\nplaintiffs who their counsel described as “just common folk, and that’s common folk that is\n\nasking for these documents, not competitors. And you guys intentionally, Michelin intentionally\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 3\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0813\n\fkeeps all this information from these folks, right?” (Depo. at 97) Mr. Price explained that trade\n\nsecret documents are proprietary and not disclosed to the public. Id. at 98.\n\n       Because aspect specifications were proven to be MNA’s highly protected trade secrets,\n\nthe burden then shifted to plaintiffs to show that such documents were “necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of their case” under In re Continental General Tire, 979 S.W.2d 609 (Tex. 1998)\n\nand In re Bridgestone/Firestone, 106 S.W.3d 730 (2003). Plaintiffs provided no such proof\n\nwhatsoever. In a case from the Dallas Court of Appeals in 2010, In re Goodyear Tire and\n\nRubber Co., 392 S.W.3d 687 (Tex. App. – Dallas 2010, orig. proc.), the Court granted\n\nmandamus and protected as trade secrets Goodyear’s quality control information and quality\n\nassurance systems.\n\n       Consequently, MNA seeks reconsideration of the ruling requiring production of all aspect\n\nspecifications, even those unrelated to plaintiffs’ specific defect theories. MNA also respectfully\n\nrequests a stay of the November 24 production date for aspect specifications so that it may\n\npursue mandamus on production of these trade secret documents.\n\n                                            III.\n                     Scope of Production Expanded to Non-Similar Tires\n\n       Additionally, the November 11 Order set the initial scope for discovery as the three\n\ncommon green tires of the tire at issue manufactured at the Dothan plant for 5 years, from 1998-\n\n2003. MNA has already provided documents to plaintiffs under this agreed upon scope, which\n\nare substantially similar tires. Dissatisfied, plaintiffs sought an even broader scope in their\n\nproposed order ultimately signed by this Court. By the November 11 Order, the scope has now\n\nbeen expanded to tire sizes and configurations which are different designs from the tire in\n\nquestion in this case, other than sharing the same brand name “LTX M/S.”\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 4\n\n                                                                                             MR 0814\n\f       MNA has already responded to a host of document requests related to the tire in question\n\nand all substantially similar tires. Yet the scope now expansively encompasses all documents\n\nrelated to three additional size LTX M/S tires – the 235, 245, and 265 LTX M/S – plus all size\n\n255 tires, without regard to rim diameter, section width, load range, components, number of\n\nplies, types of plies, speed ratings, tread depth, or original equipment versus replacement tire\n\nprogram. MNA explained that “LTX M/S” is simply a marketing label, and not a designation by\n\nwhich substantial similarity can be defined. (Price Aff. at ¶17) Including various sizes of tires\n\nas substantially similar ignores critical differences which make the tire at issue different from\n\nother tires. (Id. at §20-27)    The type and size of many individual components vary\n\nsignificantly, including different thicknesses of shoulder areas of the tread, tread widths,\n\ndifferent top and bottom belt widths, belt gauges, tread compounds, other rubber formulas\n\nand many other items. Id. Further, the November 11 Order requires the scope for these four tire\n\nsizes to include all MNA manufacturing plants, not just the Dothan plant where the tire at issue\n\nwas manufactured.\n\n       Texas law does not permit discovery regarding products that the plaintiff did not use.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has granted mandamus relief to several product-liability defendants\n\n“when a discovery order covered products the plaintiff never used.” In re Graco Children’s\n\nProds., Inc., 210 S.W.3d 598, 600-01 (Tex. 2006) (holding alleged defect in harness clip of\n\nbaby’s car seat did not support production of other allegedly defective products that did not\n\ninclude harnesses) (citing In re American Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711, 713 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(holding that discovery order that included all respiratory products manufactured by defendant\n\nwas too broad because it included respiratory equipment plaintiffs never alleged they used);\n\nTexaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898 S.W.2d 813, 814 (Tex. 1995)\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 5\n\n                                                                                            MR 0815\n\f       Courts in Texas and across the country have defined the appropriate scope of discovery\n\nin products liability cases to relate to the specific product at issue, or substantially similar\n\nproducts. “Substantially similar” means of a similar design to the product at issue. A federal\n\nregulation defines substantial similarity for tires sold outside the United States compared to\n\ntires sold in the United States as: “the same size, speed rating, load index, load range, number\n\nof plies and belts, and similar ply and belt construction and materials, placement of\n\ncomponents, and component materials, irrespective of plant of manufacture or tire line.” 49\n\nCFR 579.4 (d)(3).\n\n       In tire litigation, courts have limited the scope of discovery to tires made from the same\n\nspecification, at the same plant, and in the same time period as the tire at issue:\n\n   •   Johnson v. Hankook Tire Mfg. Co., No. 2:09CV113-MPM-DAS, 2011 WL 39042 (N.D.\n       Miss. Jan. 5, 2011). Plaintiff argued “that ‘similar tires’ would be tires that utilize the\n       same skim stock, wedge material, inner liner, and/or (AO) package as the accident tire,”\n       while Hankook argued that only tires sharing a common green were similar tires. Id. at\n       *2. The court observed that 49 C.F.R. § 579.4 defines green tires as “tires that are\n       produced to the same internal specification but that have, or may have, different external\n       characteristics and may be sold under different tire line names.” Id. Noting that “how a\n       particular component performs in a tire is totally dependent upon all of the other\n       components in a tire and how they work together per their specifications,” the court\n       concluded that “[c]omparing tires that do not share common green internal specifications\n       as defined by the CFR is, therefore, useless to the trier of fact.” Id. The court thus\n       limited Plaintiff’s discovery requests to “the subject model and size tire and any tire that\n       shares a common green internal specification as opposed to any tire that might share a\n       generic component.” Id.\n\n   •   Alvarez v. Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 75 So. 3d 789 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2011) (en banc).\n       Cooper argued that differences in the processing and specifications made only tires with\n       the same or related Green Tire Specification (“GTS”) relevant. Id. at 791. The court\n       found: “Looking to other courts, we find that in similar discovery disputes most courts\n       have limited production to the GTS numbers which correspond to the tire which was the\n       subject of the suit.” Id. at 795.\n\n   •   Hajek v. Kumho Tire Co., No. 4:08CV3157, 2010 WL 503044, at *7-8 (D. Neb. Feb. 8,\n       2010) (denying motion to compel because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that discovery\n       targeted information regarding similar tires manufactured within relevant time period).\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 6\n\n                                                                                              MR 0816\n\f    •   Murphy v.

Mar. 10, 2006) (limiting discovery to “the subject tire and all other\n        Goodyear tires made from the same green tire, and with the same tread pattern, as the\n        subject tire”);\n\n    •   Barcenas v. Ford Motor Co., No. C 03-04644RMWE, 2004 WL 2827249, at *7 (N.D.\n        Cal. Dec. 9, 2004) (denying motion to compel production of documents relating to tire\n        not substantially similar to subject tire);\n\n    As pointed out in MNA’s Response to plaintiffs’ motion to compel, Hajek, 2010 WL\n\n503044, has similar arguments as those made by plaintiffs here. They moved to compel\n\nKumho Tire to produce certain documents regarding “the entire ‘Kumho Road Venture line\n\nof tires.’” Id. at *3.   The district court found the requests overly broad. “There are many\n\nrecognized causes for tread separation,” the court reasoned, including “poor tire maintenance\n\nand motorist negligence.” Id. at *7. And “nothing indicating a common component of all\n\n‘Kumho Road Venture line of tires’ caused the accident tire to fail.” Id. The court explained:\n\n               Collecting volumes of information regarding all Kumho tires,\n               without any threshold evidentiary showing of how those tires\n               are similar to the accident tire for the purposes of this litigation,\n               or that the information requested has any relationship to the\n               underlying cause of the alleged tread separation at issue, is\n               unduly burdensome and not likely to lead to the discovery of\n               relevant information.\n\nId. at *8 (citations omitted).\n\n        The same is true here. MNA has shown that the different sizes of LTX M/S tires have\n\nnothing in common with the tire at issue. Without any showing whatsoever of substantial\n\nsimilarity, this Court’s November 11 Order is overbroad and MNA seeks reconsideration to\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 7\n\n                                                                                             MR 0817\n\flimit the scope to the tire in question and 3 common green tires. Only tires manufactured to\n\nthe same overall design specification are sufficiently similar to be capable of any\n\nmeaningful comparison. Tires made to different designs are simply different products.\n\n       Also significant is the fact that the newly expanded scope applies to all of plaintiffs’\n\nrequests for documents, which now include additional trade secret documents, including training\n\nmaterials, adjustment data, testing and design documents, specifications and changes, internal\n\nresearch and studies, manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, among others. See\n\nChart of Trade Secret Requested Production at Ex. B hereto. MNA proved the trade secret\n\nnature of such documents and it has not been refuted. Thus, it is error to order disclosure of\n\ntrade secrets under the authority presented above.\n\n                                           IV.\n                              Compound (Skim Stock) Formulas\n\n       The November 11 Order recites that “Michelin is allowed to respond” to Plaintiffs’ Legal\n\nAuthority Requiring Production of Belt Skim Stock filed on September 11, 2015. Yet MNA\n\nalready filed its response on the belt skim stock argument on September 24, 2015. MNA\n\nrequests that the Order be modified to delete the “allowed to respond” language and also seeks a\n\nruling denying plaintiffs’ request for MNA’s trade secret compound formula.\n\n                                            V.\n                            Rulings at November 3, 2015 Hearing\n\n       Finally, as noted, the November 3, 2015 hearing has not been transcribed, nor has an\n\nOrder been entered.

(\"MNA\"), competently testify as follows:\n\n      I. This affidavit is based on my personal knowledge and my review of information\n\n         available to me in my role at MNA. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n         competent to execute this Affidavit. This supplements my Affidavit filed September 1,\n\n         2105.\n\n      2. I have never been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude.\n\n      3. I am a Senior Technical Advisor employed by MNA. I was employed with Michelin\n\n         Americas Research and Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n         became a division of MNA on January 1, 2008, from January 2007 to December 2011.\n\n         Since May 1999, I have been employed by MNA. During my employment with MNA\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0822\n\f       and MARC, I have become familiar with the tires that are designed by MARC and\n\n       manufactured by MNA, as well as the design and manufacturing procedures used.\n\n   4. I am familiar with the process by which tire specifications are developed, with the\n\n       composition and dimensions of certain tires MNA has designed and manufactured during\n\n       my employment, with MNA manufacturing processes, equipment, and quality assurance\n\n       procedures, and with the efforts that MNA makes to protect its proprietary and trade\n\n       secret information.\n\n   5. Certain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's design and manufacturing specifications,\n\n       specification changes, testing and design-related documents, research and development,\n\n       tire adjustment processes and analysis, intemal research and studies, propriety\n\n       manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n       Plaintiffs also request all of MNA's Aspect Specifications which are used to inspect a\n\n       finished tire following quality assurance protocols to look for certain characteristics in the\n\n       tire after it is manufactured. There are hundreds of aspect specifications. They are part of\n\n       an extensive quality assurance process developed internally by MNA based on years of\n\n       experience and extensive testing and analysis.     All such documents are highly protected\n\n       trade secrets of MNA and kept secret by MNA under the steps outlined in my September\n\n       1, 2015 affidavit.\n\n   6. Tire builder and other employees in MNA's manufacturing plants receive extensive\n\n       training to perform their jobs. They are trained on the processes and procedures and\n\n       MNA's quality standards. These training programs are developed intemally at MNA and\n\n       are based on the equipment and procedures in each individual plant at a given time.\n\n       These training materials contain the confidential manufacturing and quality procedures\n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEJ\\IENTAL AFFIDAVIT OF VANEATON PHICE, III-PAGE 2\n\n\n\n\n

Therefore, Michelin's Motion should be denied.\n\nI.       Summary of Argument.\n\n         1. The information Plaintiffs have requested is discoverable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 1.\n            Tex.R. Civ. P. 192.3(a); In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d 149, 152 (Tex.2003) (orig.\n            proceeding); In re Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.W.3d 519, 525-526 (Tex. App.\n            2009).\n\n         2. Michelin has not established that the requested information constitutes trade\n            secrets and therefore is not entitled to obstruct discovery. In re Cont'! Gen. Tire,\n            Inc., 979 S.W.2d 609, 613 (Tex. 1998); Axelson, Inc. v. Mcilhany, 798 S.W.2d 550,\n            555 (Tex. 1990); State v. Lowry, 802 S.W.2d 669, 671 (Tex. 1991); United States v.\n\n\n1\n  Yet another law firm. Yet another attorney. Yet another motion for clarification. Yet another motion to stay. Yet\nanother motion for reconsideration. With this new attorney, Michelin has now working this case about ten separate\nlawyers and has filed multiple motions about the same exact discovery delaying and stonewalling its production for\nmore than eight months.\n\n                                                         1\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0833\n\f             Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 986-87, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1077\n             (1958); Humphreys v. Caldwell, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470-71(Tex.1994).\n\n         3. The Court's September 8, 2015 Ruling severely narrowed and correctly ordered\n            the production of information since:\n\n                a. Michelin did not establish that the information requested constitutes trade\n                   secrets. Id.\n\n                b. \"[E]vidence of incidents involving other products besides the exact model at\n                   issue [are] ... discoverable.\" In re Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.W.3d 519,\n                    528 (Tex. App. 2009)\n\n         4. Michelin already agreed to produce the requested information.\n\nII.      Texas Discovery Standard.\n\n         The Supreme Court of Texas holds that the purpose of discovery is \"to seek truth, so that\n\ndisputes may be decided by those facts that are revealed, rather than concealed.\" Axelson, Inc,\n\n798 S.W.2d at 555. Therefore, \"[d]iscovery is ... the linchpin of the search for truth. State, 802\n\nS.W.2d at 671. Discovery also makes trial a \"fair contest with the issues and facts disclosed to\n\nthe fullest practicable extent.\"   United States v, 356 U.S. at 682, 78 S. Ct. 983, 986-87.\n\nConsequently, only under rare and \"narrow circumstances is it appropriate to obstruct the search\n\nfor truth by denying discovery\":\n\n      Only in certain narrow circumstances is it appropriate to obstruct the search for truth\n      by denying discovery. Very limited exceptions to the strongly prefened policy of openness\n      are recognized in our state procedural rules and statutes.\n\nState, 802 S.W.2d at 671. See Tex.R.Civ.Evid. 501; Tex.R.Civ.P. 166b(3).\n\n         Thus, \"the burden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for\n\nexemption or immunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim\" by providing evidence -\n\nnot legally insufficient conclusory allegations, without personal knowledge - to the trial court to\n\nestablish the claimed privilege:\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0834\n\f       The burden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for exemption\n       or immunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim. [citation omitted].\n\n       This means a party should provide evidence to the trial court in the form of affidavits or\n       testimony to establish the claimed privilege.\n\nState, 802 S.W.2d at 671. (e.a.).\n\n          That was Michelin's burden, and it failed to meet it. The sworn admissions made by its\n\naffiant Price at his deposition revealed his lack of personal knowledge of the contents in his\n\naffidavit. Hence, such affidavit in support of the alleged \"privilege\" is wmihless because it is\n\n\"legally invalid and therefore cannot serve as evidence in support of a claim of'' trade secrets.\n\nHumphreys, 888 S.W.2d at 470-71. Moreover, Michelin's argument of concealing every internal\n\ndocument by simply claiming \"trade secrets\" has also been soundly rejected:\n\n       Lowe's has cited no authority that a party's (or even expert's) conclusory opinion that\n       information is a trade secret or is not used industry-wide, or a party's mere desire to avoid\n       disclosing information to others, is sufficient to establish the privilege. Nor would there\n       appear to be any rationale for adopting such a position as it would seemingly allow the\n       privilege to extend to almost any internal company records.\n\n       Without evidence establishing any of the conventional trade secret factors with regard\n       to the database, Lowe's has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in\n       overruling its trade secret objection to providing deposition testimony on the creation and\n       use of the database. Accordingly, Lowe's first issue is ove1rnled.\n\nIn re Lowe's Companies, Inc., 134 S.W.3d 876, 879 (Tex. App. 2004). (e.a.).\n\n          For this reason, Michelin's Motion should be denied and immediate disclosure is\n\nrequired.\n\nIII.      Introduction.\n\n          The 2012 Labor Day weekend was great for the Medina family. Unfo1iunately, in the\n\nblink of an eye, the Medina's life changed forever.

While this fact is true,\nonly the Michelin tire failed.\n3\n   Michelin's claim that the tire \"should not have been in service\" is a fraudulent argument. Michelin's litigation\nteam has gone to the ends of the Earth to claim that there is no danger such tread belt separation caused by \"old\"\ntires:\n\n         Q.

When you were careful - I said, \"this is a warning\" - I kind of made that statement,\n                  you corrected me: Luis, this is not a warning, correct?\n         A.       Yes-\n         A.       -- that's correct.\n\n         Q.       And you say it's not a warning because?\n         A.       It's not a warning.

That was not the intent of the document, !!Q.\n\n         Q.       So you agree with me, right, would not warn anyone of anything because it is not\n                  a warning, correct?\n        A.        That's a logical statement, I guess.\n                                                      ******\n         Q.       Okay.

This Technical Bulletin is not a warning of any hazard?\n        A.        Correct.\n\n        Q.       Is not a warning that as tires grow older, they are more likely to lead to treat belt\n                 separation?\n        A.       That is correct. It does not warn against that.\n\n        Q.       It's not a warning concerning tire aging and tread belt detachment?\n        A.       No. It is not a warning.\n\n        Q.       It is not a warning to the effect that if you don't do what it says, a tire may fall\n                 apart?\n        A.       No. It is not a warning.\n                                                      ******\n        Q.       Since your Technical Bulletin is not a warning, you warn no one of anything?\n        A.

See Amended Motion to Compel dated August 25 at pp. 6-10. With a few\n\nexceptions, Michelin refused disclosure by wholesale claiming \"trade secrets\" in response to\n\nmore than twenty-five (25) of Plaintiffs' requests for production. However, Michelin provided\n\nno evidence 6 supporting its objection to producing the requested documents about the design,\n\ntesting, manufacture, building, and inspection of the subject LTX MIS. Id. Despite repeated\n\nassurances 7 that the requested documentation would be produced once Plaintiffs executed\n\n\n\n6\n As Plaintiffs' counsel pointed out to the Co mt, Michelin got Plaintiffs' requests in April and did not provide fil!Y\nevidence establishing that the information constituted trade secrets:\n\n         MR. GUERRA: Your Honor, we got this request in April. No affidavit in May, June, July until we\n         file the motion to compel no affidavit still. Now we got this affidavit.\n\nSeptember 8, 2015 Transcriptfi,om Plaintiffi' Motion to Compel Hearing at 27:13-16.\n7\n  Defense counsel repeatedly promised that if Plaintiffs just signed Michelin's Protective Order, they would get the\nremaining documents:\n\n                  Your email is correct that MNA anticipates being able to make its supplemental\n                  production within 10-14 days of the protective order being entered.\n\nE-Mail fi·om Nelson Mullins, counsel for MNA, May 28, 2015, Exhibit C to Plaintiffi' August 25, 2015 Amended\nMotion to Compel.\n\n                  [W]e will move forward with the agreed protective order and with our supplemental\n                  production, which we would anticipate making within 10-14 days of entry of the\n                  protective order.\n\nE-Mailfi,om Nelson Mullins, counsel for MNA, May 29, 2015, Exhibit D to Plaintiffi' August 25, 2015 Amended\nMotion to Compel.\n\n\n                                                          6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                  MR 0838\n\fMichelin's Protective Order, they never came. So, Plaintiffs filed their Motion to Compel on\n\nAugust 25, 2015. See Amended Motion to Compel dated August 25, 2015.\n\nV.       The September 8, 2015 Hearing.\n\n        At the September 8, 2015 concerning Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel, to justify its\n\nabsconding of evidence, Michelin relied exclusively on the affidavit of Vaneaton Price - an\n\naffidavit8 which Michelin knew did not pass muster.                   In Texas, to testify about privileged\n\ninformation the affiant must have personal knowledge of it. Humphreys, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470.\n\nPrice does not have personal knowledge:\n\n        So, at this hearing, Plaintiffs' counsel informed the Honorable Court that Michelin's\n\naffiant Price was unqualified to testify about the contents of his affidavit. As explained, Price\n\nworks in Michelin's legal department. He is not a tire builder, or a tire manufacturer, or a tire\n\ndesigner, or a tire project manager, or a tire manufacturer, or a skim stock compounder, or a tire\n\ninspector, or an adjustment inspector, and therefore did not have personal knowledge or\n\ncompetence to testify that the infmmation requested constituted trade secrets:\n\n        He works on the litigation Defendant sic [department] of Michelin . . . And\n        going back to the affidavit ... [he's] not a tire builder, not a tire manufacturer .\n        . . not a tire designer; didn't design this tire; was not a project manager;\n        didn't work on the plant.\n\nSeptember 8, 2015 Transcript from Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Hearing at 30:23 - 32:2. (e.a.).\n\n\n\n\n                 We are working on the production and still anticipate malting it within 10-14\n                 days of entry of the protective order as originally estimated.\n\nE-Mailfiwn Nelson Mullins, counsel for MNA, June 4, 2015, Exhibit E to Plaintiffs' August 25, 2015 Amended\nMotion to Compel.\n\n8\n Strangely, Michelin used Mr. Price's affidavit as both a sword and a shield. Michelin used the affidavit to prevent\ndisclosure of discoverable evidence but then refused to allow Plaintiffs' to cross-examine him about the affidavit\nand his personal knowledge of the contents of such affidavit. The Honorable Court ovenuled Michelin's objection\nand ordered Mr. Price's deposition, which was conducted on October 22, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                MR 0839\n\f            Accordingly, there was never a finding by the Court that Michelin established trade\n\nsecrets.\n\n              a. The Court's Ruling severely narrowed the discovery allowed.\n\n            Since by law Plaintiffs are entitled to conduct discovery about 1) \"evidence of incidents\n\ninvolving other products besides the exact model at issue\" In re Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299\n\nS.W.3d at 528 and also 2) the multitude of components and conditions the parties have alleged\n\nare at issue (Plaintiffs: over-age rnbber stock, liner pattern marks, thin inner liner, premature\n\noxidation on the belt skin, improper splicing of belts, improper spacing and placement of the\n\nsteel cords and belts, improper inspection and/or repair of the tire at the factory, lack of nylon\n\noverlay/nylon cap ply or safety, air migration through the inner liner, aging of the tire and its\n\ncomponents, trapped air or steam inside the tire components, aging and/or contamination of pre-\n\ncured rnbber and rnbber coated tire components, and misplacement of the steel belts;\n\nDefendants: overdeflection, underinflation, impact damage), the Honorable Court:\n\n       1. Severely narrowed9 the scope of discovery requested by Plaintiffs (Transcript at 42:10-\n          12; 45:5-6).     .\n\n                    First, the Court nalTowed the other tire widths to only 235, 245 and 265 -\n                    far from what Plaintiffs requested. Second, the Court nalTowed the scope\n                    to make sure that such tires were the same type of tire - P-Metric tires as\n                    opposed to also light trnck tires (Transcript at 45:8-12). Third, the Court\n                    drastically reduced the time scope from Plaintiffs' request (tires made from\n                    the start of the manufacture of the LTX MIS to the end of production) to a\n                    very nalTOW scope of production: \"six months before and the year after.\"\n                     (Transcript at 58: 12-13). Therefore, if any party should be complaining\n                    about the scope of production, it should be Plaintiffs.\n\n       2. Ordered production of \"the oldest version\" of its Aspect Specifications 10 . (Transcript at\n          59:11).\n9\n    Therefore, if any party should be complaining about the scope of production, it should be Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n                                                             8\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            MR 0840\n\fVI.         Price's deposition\n\n            The Court's ruling was crystal clear 11 .          Still, Michelin sat and never produced the\n\ndocuments in compliance with its strategy of delay and stonewalling. So, Plaintiffs deposed\n\nPrice to further expose Michelin's fictitious claim of trade secrets.                           Aware of Price's\n\nshortcomings, but still using him as a sword to claim \"trade secrets,'' Michelin tried to shield his\n\ncross-examination and refused to produce Price for deposition. More delay. More stonewalling.\n\nSo, Plaintiffs were forced to file a Motion to Compel - which was granted.\n\n           Deeply worried about Price's lack of personal knowledge about his affidavit's contents,\n\nMichelin contacted and retained an army of attorneys from across the country to prepare him for\n\ndeposition: 1) Kate Helm, (from Atlanta, Georgia); 2) Michael Wiggins, (from Orlando, Florida);\n\n3) Danean Sturino, (from Chicago, Illinois); 4) Tom Bullion, (from Austin, Texas); and 5) Nicole\n\nBuntin, (from Greenville, South Carolina). 12 These attorneys spent a minimum of seven (7)\n\nhours and some up to several days preparing the unqualified Price for his deposition. It did not\n\nhelp       Michelin.         Thus,    it 1s     no     surprise that     Michelin -         m    its   Motion      for\n\nReconsideration/Clarification/Stay - omitted the hundreds of admissions that Price made under\n\noath that exposed his lack of personal knowledge about the contents of his affidavit:\n\n10\n     Aspect Specifications/Aspect Specification Repertoire/Aspect Specification Annexes - are the actual\nmanufacturing/quality control information/laser photographs that the tire inspectors use when they are looking for\ndefects/anomalies/abnormal conditions (blisters, abnormal coloring, molding, cord/cable placement, improper\ncreases, folds, and openings, mold or curing issues, foreign material found in the tire and other various conditions)\nfound after the tire is manufactured but before it leaves the factory for distribution. The aspect specifications also\nprovide a decision tree on what the inspector/verifier should do when a specific defect is found (repair, scrap, etc.).\n\nThus, these documents are necessary for Plaintiffs to prove their case so they can show that the\ndefects/conditions/components alleged by Plaintiffs or the conditions that Michelin claim were caused by the tire's\nwear and tear left the factory that way.\n\n11\n  Michelin claims the Court did not rule until November 11. Wrong. The Court ordered production of all of these\ndocuments back on September 8, 2015. Michelin sat on this for months and on the eve of its deadline to produce the\ndocuments, seeks reconsideration and a stay. It should not be permitted.\n\n12\n     Deposition ofMr. Price at pp. 22-27, Exhibit A.\n\n\n\n                                                           9\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   MR 0841\n\f            1.

Humphreys, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470-71. Price's self-serving\n\naffidavit is also filled with worthless conclusory allegations:\n\n            Mark, however, had the burden to establish the seismic data is a trade secret.\n            (citations omitted). Mark has failed to make this showing, simply making the\n            conclusory determination that the seismic data is a trade secret.\n\nTXO Prod. Co. v. MD. Mark, Inc., 999 S.W.2d 137, 142 (Tex. App. 1999). (e.a.).\n\n            Therefore, Michelin has not met its burden in establishing that the information sought\n\nconstitutes trade secrets, requiring denial of Michelin's Motion.\n\nVIII. The Court ordered scope includes only tires that are 100% discoverable.\n\n            The Court correctly found that by precluding Plaintiffs from conducting discovery on\n\nother models, it would effectively bar Plaintiffs from proving several of its claims including but\n\nnot limited to knowledge that Michelin was aware of tread separation problem, safer alternative\n\ndesign, failure to respond to known defect, inadequate recalls, feasibility of alternative designs,\n\netc., etc.:\n\n           Indeed, because product liability claimants must prove a safer \"alternative\"\n           design, see Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann.§ 82.005, it would be absurd to\n           limit discovery to the specific model at issue because that would necessarily\n           preclude discovery on alternative designs.\n\nIn re ExmarkMfg.

(e.a.).\n\n            Michelin claims that it \"has shown that the different sizes of LTX MIS tires have nothing\n\nin common with the tire at issue.\" Wrong. Not only has Exmarkrejected this argument, but as\n\ndemonstrated above, Michelin did not establish or \"show\" anything. Rather, Price's lack of\n\npersonal knowledge renders Michelin's argument that \"the different sizes of LTX M/S tires have\n\nnothing in common with the tire at issue\" worthless.

The Court's severe narrowing of discovery destroys Michelin's argument that the\n            November 11, 2015 Order is \"overbroad.\"\n\n            Moreover, even if we were to accept this argument, to accommodate Michelin's request\n\nthat the discovery order be narrower, the Court has already significantly and severely reduced\n\nPlaintiffs' requested discovery and its scope. First, the Comi narrowed the other tire widths to\n\nonly 235, 245 and 265 - far from what Plaintiffs requested. Second, the Court narrowed the\n\nscope to make sure that such tires were the same type of tire -P-Metric tires as opposed to also\n\nlight truck tires (Transcript at 45:8-12). Third, the Court also drastically reduced the time\n\nscope from Plaintiffs' request (tires made from the start of the manufacture of the LTX MIS to\n\n\n\n27\n     As shown above, Mr. Price did not talk to a single (1) person in order to obtain the information in his affidavit:\n\n           In addition to a person's job title or position, affiants should also explain how they became\n           familiar with the facts in the affidavit.\n\nValenzuela v.

The requested documents are common to all tire lines as admitted by Price.\n\n         As admitted by Price, the documents requested by Plaintiffs (i.e. manufacturing and\n\ninspection documents) are used across all tire lines as\n\n                 Q.      Michelin has employees that write and set manufacturing and\n                         design processes, procedures and techniques for the L TX MIS line,\n                         right?\n                 A.

Those types of documents are used on all tire lines.\n\nDeposition ofPrice at p. 58, Exhibit A. (e.a.).\n\n        Thus, in trying to improperly nanow the scope even more, Michelin misled the Court\n\nwhen it stated that the documents sought by Plaintiffs are only used on the subject P255/70R 16\n\nLTX M/S tire. At best, this is a misrepresentation. At worst, it is a ...\n\nXI.     Case law and arguments used by Michelin were rejected by the Texas Courts. In re\n        Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.W.3d at 527.\n\n        To support its Motion, Michelin cited In re Graco Children's Prods., 210 S.W.3d 598,\n\n600-01 (Tex.2006) (orig. proceeding), In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711, 714 (Tex.1998)\n\nand Texaco, Inc. v. Sanderson, 898 S.W.2d 813, 815 (Tex.1995). The Texas Court of Appeals\n\nsoundly distinguished Graco 28, American Optical and Texaco, holding that that discovery of\n\nsafer alternative designs - an alleged defect pled by Plaintiffs        was required:\n\n\n28\n  Unlike here and in In re Exmark, the courts in In re Graco, In re American Optical Corp. or in Texaco did not\ndiscuss the discovery about \"safer alternative design\".\n\n                                                      22\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            MR 0854\n\f       Exmark's argument misconstrues the scope of allowable discovery under the rules\n       pertaining to discovery and Texas Supreme Court precedent regarding the\n       discovery of safer alternative designs.\n                                              *****\n       We conclude that the discovery order at issue here was reasonably tailored to the\n       relevant product defect and was not impe1missibly overbroad. [citation omitted].\n                                              *****\n       The order at issue is saliently different from the discovery orders that were reversed\n       by the supreme court insofar as, in the instant case, there is a connection between\n       the alleged defect and the discovery ordered.\n\n       The order compels discovery of documents that are reasonably calculated to lead to\n       the discovery of admissible evidence regarding whether Exmark knew about the\n       necessity for, or defects in, its rollover protective systems.\n\nIn re ExmarkMfg. Co., Inc., 299 S.W.3d at 527, 530. (e.a.).\n\n       Finally, Michelin's reliance on In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d 711, 713 (1998)\n\nsupports Plaintiffs since that case dealt with a discovery order that required production of nearly\n\nall its documents regarding its products for a fifty-year (50) period. Here, as shown above, the\n\nCourt severely and nairnwly reduced the discovery scope (including time) in this case, requiring\n\ndenial of Michelin's motion.\n\nXII.   Michelin has already agreed to produce the documents.\n\n       Plaintiffs are shocked by Michelin's Motion. In open Comi, Michelin repeatedly agreed\n\nto produce the documents contained in the Court's November 11, 2015 Order.\n\n   •   On September 8, 2015, counsel for Michelin \"agreed to produce the oldest available\n       copies of the general principles, technical notes and not tire marks, informed procedures\n       (phonetic), [Mr. Bullion stated \"Tire Non-Conforming Procedures]\". Michelin's counsel\n       did not place any limitations, restrictions, conditions or qualifiers on its production\n       of these documents. September8, 2015 Transcriptat45:21-23. (e.a.).\n\n   •   On November 3, 2015, counsel for Michelin agreed to the production:\n\n              What I would like to say on the record if possibly, Your Honor, is once we\n              get a ruling on that on that motion to compel then we will be in a\n              position to produce the additional documents and they can ask all of\n              these witnesses whatever questions they want to ask them with regard to all\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0855\n\f                  of the documents we produced. So that is what I would like to make sure\n                  it's clear on the record.\n\nNovember 3, 2015 Transcript at 17:4-11. (e.a.).\n\n     •   On November 3, 2015, counsel for Michelin yet again agreed to the production:\n\n                 This tire was built in 2001 and Your Honor you wanted us to produce the\n                 oldest version of all of the aspect specifications . . . So once you enter\n                 your written order, then we'll produce the oldest version.\n\nNovember 3, 2015 Transcript at 24:13-22. (e.a.).\n\n         Over and over again, Michelin judicially admitted on the record that it would produce the\n\ndocuments ordered by the Court:\n\n         In Texas a patiy may use a fonnal judicial admission made by a party opponent as a\n         substitute for evidence ... [citation omitted]\n\n         The source of a judicial admission may be facts alleged in a pleading, an agreed upon\n         statement of fact, a stipulation, or a formal declaration made in open court by a party\n         or counsel . . . It is binding on the declarant and he cannot introduce evidence to\n         contradict it.\n\nSmith v. Altman, 26 S.W.3d 705, 708-09 (Tex. App. 2000). (e.a.).\n\nConclusion: Michelin's time is up. Plaintiffs have been waiting since April for the documents.\n\nThen, the Court ordered their production back on September 829 , 2015. Michelin repeatedly\n\nagreed to produce the documents on the record. Then, they sat on it for months and at the\n\neleventh hour and on the eve of its deadline to produce the documents, seek reconsideration and\n\na stay. It should not be permitted.\n\n         In addition, the Cami severely and significantly narrowed the discovery allowed.\n\nFinally, Michelin has failed to establish that the documents and information requested by\n\n\n\n\n29\n   Michelin claims the Court did not rule until November 11. Wrong. The Court ordered production of all of these\ndocuments back on September 8, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                       24\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0856\n\f                                                                 31\nPlaintiffs' Request for Production30 are trade secrets                as required by In re Cont'!

(“MNA”) files this Motion for Stay of\n\nDisclosure of Financial Information ordered to be produced under the Order re: November 3,\n\n2015 Hearing, and Supplement to Response Opposing Disclosure of Financial Information, and\n\nrespectfully shows as follows:\n\nI.     Introduction\n\n       On November 21, 2015, this Court signed an order entitled “ORDER re: November 3,\n\n2015 Hearing” (“Nov. 21 Order”) requiring MNA to “produce a Corporate Representative to\n\ntestify about the financial condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements of Michelin North\n\nAmerica, Inc.” MNA files this Supplement to its October 30, 2015 Response to Plaintiffs’ Short\n\nMotion re: Michelin Employee with Most Knowledge about Financial Information, and objects\n\nto such required disclosure as this information is highly confidential, trade secret information, as\n\nevidenced by the affidavit of Marcel Chabot (attached as Exhibit A).\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 1\n                                                                                                       MR 0901\n\f       After the hearing, a deposition notice was issued by Plaintiffs for a Corporate\n\nRepresentative to testify about “the financial condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements\n\nof Michelin North America, Inc. (attached as Exhibit B). A “request for production” was\n\nincluded with the deposition notice seeking “Financial statements of Defendant Michelin North\n\nAmerica, Inc. from 1998 to 2014,” thus seeking an incredibly expansive production of fourteen\n\nyears of financial statements. Such information is clearly sought as a litigation strategy for\n\npurposes of harassment and should not be allowed by this Court.\n\n       At the November 3, 2015 hearing, this Court orally ordered that the deposition on MNA’s\n\nfinancials be taken, but “if [MNA] choses to seek the writ of mandamus, I will stay the discovery\n\non the net worth while you do that.” (Hearing at 32). Consequently, MNA requests a stay of the\n\nNov. 21 Order regarding MNA’s financial information, and also requests this Court to defer\n\ndiscovery on MNA’s net worth until the second phase of the bifurcated trial.\n\nII.    MNA’s Financial Information is Highly Confidential, Trade Secret, and\n       Unnecessary to Plaintiffs’ Case at this Juncture.\n\n       MNA demonstrated in its Response filed on October 30, 2015 that its financial\n\ninformation is highly sensitive and confidential, and “disclosure of such information will result\n\nin a grave risk to MNA and endanger MNA’s ability to remain financially competitive in a\n\nhighly competitive business environment.” Response at 6. This position is supported by the\n\naffidavit of Marcel Chabot, which further states that MNA is not a publicly-traded company, and\n\ntherefore MNA does not make public SEC disclosures regarding its net worth, financial\n\ncondition, nor does MNA publish its financial statements. Aff. ¶ 3. MNA is a subsidiary of its\n\nultimate parent company, Compagnie Generale Des Establissements Michelin (“CGEM”), a\n\nFrench corporation that is publicly traded on the Paris Stock Exchange. For accounting purposes,\n\nMNA’s financial position is fully consolidated with CGEM’s financial position, and CGEM’s\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 2\n\n                                                                                             MR 0902\n\fpublic filings reflect an overall picture of the Michelin Group of companies, and do not reflect\n\ninformation on MNA’s specific financial information. Id. Therefore, MNA’s financial\n\ninformation is not known outside of those individuals at MNA or within the Michelin Group who\n\nhave a business need to know, and it cannot easily be obtained. Id.\n\n        Mr. Charbot’s affidavit also proves that MNA “considers its financial information highly\n\nconfidential and vitally sensitive, and treats this information as a carefully guarded trade secret.”\n\nId. ¶ 4. MNA takes extreme care to protect its financial information from disclosure. Id. ¶ 6. If\n\ndisclosed, such information could seriously endanger MNA’s ability to remain financially\n\ncompetitive in the highly competitive tire industry. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n        Texas law recognizes financial information trade secret under the Texas Uniform Trade\n\nSecrets Act:\n\n        “Trade Secret” means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation,\n        program, device, method, technique, process, financial data, or list of actual or\n        potential customer or suppliers that:\n\n        (A) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being\n        generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by, other persons who can\n        obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and\n\n\n        (B) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to\n        maintain its secrecy.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 134A.002(6) (emphasis added).\n\n        The financial data requested by Plaintiffs clearly meets this statutory definition of\n\nprotected trade secrets. 1 MNA’s financial information, including its “financial condition, wealth,\n\n\n1\n   MNA’s financial information also meets the factors for trade secret under the Restatement of Torts § 757: (1) the\nextent to which the information is known outside of the owner’s business; (2) the extent to which the information is\nknown by employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken by the owner to guard the\ninformation’s secrecy; (4) the value of the information to the owner and the owner’s competitors; (5) the amount of\neffort or money expended by the owner in developing the information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the\ninformation could properly be acquired or duplicated by others. The Affidavit of Marcel Charbot proves all of these\nfactors. See Aff. ¶¶ 3-7.\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 3\n\n                                                                                                              MR 0903\n\fassets, and financial statements” required to be disclosed under the Nov. 21 Order, has great\n\neconomic value in not being known because otherwise competitors could use this information to\n\ninfer, calculate, estimate, and deduce highly confidential information about MNA’s corporate\n\nstrategies, financial condition, research and development capabilities and options, and other such\n\nvital aspects of its corporate objectives, plans, governance, and management. Aff. ¶ 5.\n\nCompetitors could then use this information to develop a competitive edge against MNA and\n\ngravely impair MNA’s ability to remain competitive. Id. MNA takes “extreme care” and makes\n\n“stringent efforts” to protect its financial information in order to remain financially competitive\n\nin a highly competitive business environment. Aff. ¶¶ 6, 7. Its financial information is stored on\n\na secured database and only MNA personnel with heightened security access are permitted to\n\nobtain it, and only on a need to know basis. Aff. ¶ 7. Employees who work with this information\n\nsign strict confidentiality agreements. Id.\n\n       In short, MNA’s private financial information is a closely guarded trade secret of MNA,\n\nand qualifies as a trade secret under Texas law.\n\nIII.   This Court Should Defer Discovery of Highly Confidential and Trade Secret\n       Financial Information until there is Proof of Necessity for Such Information.\n\n       MNA has filed a motion to bifurcate the trial under § 41.009 of the Texas Civil Practices\n\n& Remedies Code. This Court should defer discovery of financial information until the second\n\nphase of a bifurcated trial for two reasons. First, highly confidential financial information is not\n\nrelevant until the second phase of a bifurcated trial. Second, MNA’s financial information is\n\ntrade secret, and, as such, Plaintiffs had the burden to demonstrate that it is necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of the case. There is no such proof. Indeed, financial information cannot be\n\nnecessary at this point in the litigation, because there is only a mere allegation of punitive\n\ndamages, and no evidence to support liability for punitive damages. Deferring discovery of net\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 4\n\n                                                                                              MR 0904\n\fworth or other financial information until the second phase of the bifurcated trial would be a\n\nproper exercise of “the [trial court’s] necessary management tools to control the sequence,\n\ntiming, and scope of discovery to minimize burden, maximize efficiency, and protect privacy\n\nrights.” In re Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d 35, 52 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, orig. proc.)\n\n(Sullivan, J., concurring).\n\n       Net worth discovery serves little practical purpose in most cases, given the statutory\n\nlimitations on exemplary damages. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.4 sets out a benefit-to-\n\nburden analysis and provides that discovery should be limited when “the burden or expense of\n\nthe proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the\n\namount in controversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the\n\nlitigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.” Because the\n\nfinancial information Plaintiffs seek is highly confidential, intrudes on MNA’s substantial\n\nprivacy rights, and is trade secret, discovery of this information should be deferred to the second\n\nphase of the bifurcated trial, if it becomes relevant and necessary. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 41.009.\n\n       Finally, Texas Rule of Evidence 507 imposes a “heightened burden for obtaining trade\n\nsecret information.” Mere relevance is not sufficient. See Continental General Tire, 979 S.W.2d\n\n610-13 (Tex. 1998). After the party resisting discovery establishes that the information is a trade\n\nsecret, the burden shifts to the requesting party to establish that the information is “necessary for\n\na fair adjudication of tis claims.” Id. In each case, a court must conduct a balancing, weighing the\n\ndegree of the requesting party’s need for the information with the potential harm of disclosure.\n\nThe Court further clarified the burden of proof in In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., 106 S.W.3d\n\n730, 732-33 (Tex. 2003), by requiring the requesting party to “demonstrate with specificity,” by\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 5\n\n                                                                                               MR 0905\n\fcompetent evidence, the necessity of the trade secret information. As stated, there is simply no\n\nnecessity for such information at this point in the litigation – net worth evidence is inadmissible\n\nand irrelevant in the first phase of a bifurcated trial. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 41.011(b).\n\nPlaintiffs have not, and cannot show necessity. Therefore, This Court should protect MNA’s\n\ntrade secret financial information, and only order its disclosure if it becomes necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of this case. There is no prejudice to Plaintiffs if discovery of financial information\n\nis deferred until the second phase of the bifurcated trial, if it becomes relevant and necessary at\n\nthat point.\n\nIV.     Conclusion and Prayer\n\n        Wherefore, MNA prays that this Court disallow discovery of MNA’s financial\n\ninformation. Alternatively MNA seeks a stay of such financial discovery for the issue to be\n\nconsidered on mandamus at the Dallas Court of Appeals, or Texas Supreme Court, and for such\n\nother relief to which it may be entitled.\n\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              THOMPSON & KNIGHT LLP\n                                              98 San Jacinto Boulevard, Suite 1900\n                                              Austin, Texas 78701-4238\n                                              (512) 469-6114\n                                              (512) 482-5028 Facsimile\n\n                                              By:           /s/ Debora B.

(\"MNA\"), who being by me duly sworn\n\non oath deposes and says:\n\n       1.     My name is Marcel Chabot and I am the Controller at MNA. I have personal\n\n              knowledge of the facts set forth herein and if called upon, could and would,\n\n              competently testify to them.    I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n              competent to execute this Affidavit.\n\n       2.     I have reviewed the Order re: November 3, 2015 hearing in this case that orders\n\n              MNA to \"produce a corporate representative to testify about the financial\n\n              condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements of Defendant Michelin North\n\n              America, Inc.\"\n\n\n\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF MARC:F.L CHABOT-PAGE I\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          MR 0909\n\f       3.     MNA is not a publicly-traded company. Consequently it does not make public\n\n              disclosures concerning its net worth, financial condition, or financial statements.\n\n              Additionally, MNA is indirectly owned by a public French holding company,\n\n              Compagnie Generale Des Etablissements Michelin (\"CGEM\"). For accounting\n\n              purposes, lv!NA's financial position is fully consolidated with CGEM's financial\n\n             position, and CGEM's public filings reflect an overall picture of the Michelin\n\n              Group, and do not reflect information on MNA's specific financial position.\n\n              Consequently, MNA's financial information is not known outside of those\n\n              individuals at MNA or within the Michelin Group who have a business need to\n\n              know, and it cannot easily be obtained.\n\n       4.     MNA considers its financial information highly confidential and vitally sensitive,\n\n              and treats this information as a carefully guarded trade secret.\n\n       5.     Disclosure of MNA's financial information could seriously endanger MNA's\n\n              ability to remain financially competitive in the tire industry, which is a highly\n\n             competitive business environment. Financial information, including evidence of\n\n             net worth, can allow competitors to infer, calculate, estimate, and deduce highly\n\n             confidential information about MNA's corporate strategies, research and\n\n             development capabilities and options, and other vital aspects of its corporate\n\n             objectives, plans, financial position, governance, and management. Competitors\n\n             could then use this information to develop a competitive advantage against MNA\n\n             and impair MNA's ability to maintain its competitive position in the market.\n\n       6.    MNA takes extreme care to protect its financial information from being disclosed.\n\n             MNA has a competitive advantage by not having such information available in\n\n\n\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF MARCEL CHABOT~ PAGE 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0910\n\f30\n\n\n\n\n     MR 0911\n\f  Via £-Service and Facsi111ile      Via £-Service and Facsi111ile\n  Luis P.

We are here talking about can we hide\n22 the evidence, can we hide documentation, can we not give\n23 these folks the ability to fairly adjudicate their claims\n24 in court.\n25                 Your Honor, when we were here in May 11\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0010\n\f                                                                   5\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 when I met you, at the end of their hearing, I said, Your\n2 Honor, I'm having problems with documentation and how\n3 fast can I get a hearing?     I don't know if you remember\n4 that.     You said, Luis, three days; unless they object,\n5 they have waived their notice.\n6                   I ask Chris, do you object, do you waive\n7 the notice?\n8                   And he said, no.\n9                   I said, okay, Your Honor, I'll go down\n10 there.    I'm going to talk to him about this document.\n11 It's all on the record.\n12                  I went outside, talked to Chris.      And he\n13 said, Luis, I'm not in charge of discovery.      I don't do\n14 any of that.    This is the national discovery counsel,\n15 Nelson Mullins.    And the guy that you need to talk to is\n16 Giles, you know Giles Schanen.      He is not here today.\n17 You notice that.    He's not here.    Giles Schanen.\n18                  I said, I never met Giles.    I hold you\n19 accountable because you are the face of Michelin.\n20                  And he said to me, okay, but, you know,\n21 that's the guy that is dealing with this.      You dealt with\n22 Kate Helm before, same firm, Nelson Mullins, on a case\n23 that we have previous against Michelin, same tire, same\n24 exact stuff.    And so you know how it goes.\n25                  I said, no, I don't know how it goes, but\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0011\n\f                                                                    6\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 okay.\n2                   And he said, you sign a protective order,\n3 you get the documents.\n4                   I don't like protective orders.     I really\n5 don't, Your Honor, because they hide all these defects,\n6 problems with these products away from the public\n7 forever.\n8                   Okay.   Onto documents.    That's how they\n9 get us.     They have us because without the documents I\n10 can't prove my case.\n11                  Obdulia is quadriplegic.     These are the\n12 facts.    It's not my case.    It's her.    So when I'm\n13 speaking, it's her speaking.      I'm asking you, she is\n14 sleeping, coming with her husband from Chicago to\n15 St. Louis laying on his shoulder --\n16                  THE COURT:    I'm familiar with the facts\n17 from last time and from reading the pleadings.       Tell me\n18 what you want.    How about that?\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.    I'll do that, Your\n20 Honor.\n21                  I want fairness.      And the fairness that I\n22 want -- we were here on May 11th and we were talking\n23 about that --\n24                  THE COURT:    Yeah.    What documents do you\n25 want?\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0012\n\f                                                                 7\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. GUERRA:    I'll tell you, Your Honor.\n2 I'll tell you, but I need to explain a little bit.        I can\n3 tell you exactly which documents I want.\n4                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    There they are, Your Honor.\n6 Here's the list.    Would you give a list to opposing\n7 counsel, please.\n8                  But the point I was making, all the\n9 objections of the Defendants are absolutely worthless at\n10 this point.    First, the documents are trade secret.\n11 There's a protective order.     There was no problem before.\n12 There's no problem now.      They are protected.   They never\n13 proved that they were confidential or trade secret\n14 documents.    That's okay.    They have that.\n15                 The documents are not relevant.     Okay.\n16 All right.    But this is discovery.   We're not talking\n17 about admissibility for trial.     If they are not relevant,\n18 you will be able to file the motions in limine.\n19                 But they also say, Your Honor, that -- one\n20 of the arguments that the documents are not relevant is\n21 because it relates to different tires and the tires that\n22 have nothing to do with this tire.     That's not true.     The\n23 LTX M/S line is a line of tires -- and, in fact, Michelin\n24 doesn't even categorize them by line.     It categorizes\n25 them by the type of use.      So light truck tires are\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0013\n\f                                                               8\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 manufactured, inspected and designed the same way.      And I\n2 can prove it to you with physical evidence not talk.\n3                  And also, Your Honor, remember if in fact\n4 we follow Michelin logic about just giving the\n5 documents -- you can only try the case with the documents\n6 that I choose you should have.    That's not the way the\n7 system works based upon good Texas case law.\n8                  The Cheer Mark (phonetic) case, Your\n9 Honor, that I'm sure you're familiar with from the court\n10 of appeals has pages and pages and pages of explanation\n11 why you are entitled to similar tires, not identical, not\n12 just the product, not just the identical product, similar\n13 so you can look for alternative designs, notice to the\n14 manufacturer, consequences of not putting the alternative\n15 design, all of it covered by our lawsuit.\n16                 And it says -- the phrase is relevant to\n17 the subject matter and reasonably calculated to lead to\n18 admissible evidence and legally construed to allow\n19 litigants to obtain the fullest knowledge of the facts\n20 and issues prior to the trial.   And that's the point\n21 here.\n22                 Mr. Blackerby came here on May 11th and\n23 said, Your Honor, we need to have that tire -- we need to\n24 have those tires so we can have what Plaintiffs have.\n25 Just fairness, just level playing field, that's what I\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0014\n\f                                                                 9\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 want.\n2                  Because if we follow Michelin's logic, I\n3 can only have some portions of it.       I believe you will\n4 only be able to look at that tire, not even the rim.\n5 Since we were here, this is what we've done for Michelin,\n6 we sent them that tire plus the three additional tires\n7 plus the spare tire plus all the rims.       Then they call us\n8 and said, we need to inspect the vehicle.\n9                  Now, there is no evidence that any of the\n10 other tires caused anything.     And, in fact, all the other\n11 types are not even Michelin.     They inspected them all.\n12                 In addition, they said, we want to inspect\n13 the vehicle.    Okay.   There is no evidence that the\n14 vehicle caused anything, but they inspected the vehicle.\n15 And then they said, we want to inspect the seatbelts.\n16 They inspected the seatbelt.\n17                 THE COURT:    Okay.   But what do you want?\n18                 MR. GUERRA:   I want all those documents.\n19 But most important, Your Honor, they told me --\n20                 THE COURT:    All right.   Let's start going\n21 through them.    We have got to go through your request and\n22 what they're not providing.\n23                 MR. GUERRA:   Okay.    Aspect specifications,\n24 Your Honor.    Aspect specifications and you have the\n25 listings there, documents that are used by the verifiers,\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0015\n\f                                                                10\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 inspectors at the factory to determine whether or not the\n2 tire that has been manufactured is up to speed, up to\n3 spec.   And the aspect verifiers the -- the inspectors\n4 have a full set at the inspection station -- these are\n5 guys that do this day in and day out -- and they still\n6 must have all of the aspect specifications present.\n7 There's 200 of them.    On this case -- 200 aspect\n8 specifications.    On this case -- don't be sorry.      I got\n9 excited.     Interrupt me, please.\n10                 On this case, they gave me nine useless\n11 aspects.    So I'm missing 191.\n12                 Let me show you, Your Honor, how useless\n13 they are.\n14                 THE COURT:    No.   I just need you to tell\n15 me what you want.\n16                 MR. GUERRA:   Just with this stuff, but it\n17 shows they are not providing evidence.      They know that\n18 nobody can read this because what is -- what is an R3H?\n19 What is an A?   What is an E?     What is a D?   What is an H?\n20 They have the code.    It's on a general principles, which\n21 is another document.\n22                 Now, recently, about a couple of days ago\n23 or maybe Thursday, we got a letter from Mr. Blackerby\n24 that said, oh, you can have the general principles.      I've\n25 been waiting five months for them.      All right.   You can\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0016\n\f                                                               11\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 have the technical notes.     Okay.    I've been waiting\n2 nine -- five months, in fact, a year for them.\n3                    Then they said, you can have the technical\n4 notes.     Okay.   Then they said, you can have the tire\n5 nonconforming procedures.     Okay.    I also want all of the\n6 technical repertoire which tells me all technical notes\n7 that exist and then also the aspect specifications\n8 repertoire, which is French for the least of aspect\n9 specifications.\n10                   Now, I speak French, just happen to, Your\n11 Honor.    It's my second language.    My first one is\n12 Portuguese, second one is French, third one is Spanish,\n13 and this is my fourth language.      Sometimes I'm not very\n14 accurate in what I say in English and for that I\n15 apologize, Your Honor.     But I do know French.   And all I\n16 want is the same courtesy that I gave these folks that\n17 Michelin gives to us.\n18                   I also need the tolerance and the limits.\n19 The tolerances and the limits, the actual limits and\n20 tolerances, are the specifications of the tire before the\n21 tire gets baked or cured.    I don't have that, Your Honor.\n22                   I also need to get the belt skim stock,\n23 which is the material that Michelin makes or the\n24 component of material that Michelin makes that covers the\n25 components to glue them together.      It's in lay terms kind\n\n\n                      VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0017\n\f                                                               12\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 of the glue of the materials so they stay together.\n2                   I also need, Your Honor, the warranty\n3 data, the warranty data.     Every time there's a defect on\n4 a tire -- and defect includes separation, a separation of\n5 the tread belt, edge belt, because the tire is inside of\n6 two steel belts.     And when the tread comes apart with the\n7 belt, separates from the rest of the carcass, that's what\n8 I'm talking about.     It's a well-known defect and they\n9 warrant for that.\n10                  I want the warranty data on that.   It's\n11 called the adjustment data.    And it gives you all kinds\n12 of details about that gives you -- not only it gives you\n13 the claims forms initially, but also the Michelin claims\n14 forms, the dealer claims forms, gives you also those code\n15 keys for those -- for the codes.     For instance, in the\n16 case of Discount Tire, 23 is tread belt separation, 54 is\n17 edge separation.    So I need the code keys that come with\n18 the code; otherwise, I will have the same problem that I\n19 have here with the aspect specs.\n20                  You know, the issue with the aspect specs,\n21 Your Honor, and you can see that they apply even though\n22 this gentleman here filed something to say that the tires\n23 are different.    That's nonsense.   Michelin classifies\n24 their tires based upon the type of use.     So passenger and\n25 light truck, the manufacturing process, the design\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0018\n\f                                                              13\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 process, the inspection process is exactly the same.       And\n2 the proof is in the pudding.\n3                 This is one of the aspect specifications,\n4 one of the nine useless that they gave me, 51.     And each\n5 one of them will say aspect specifications, passenger and\n6 light truck, not lines, not different lines of tires, not\n7 different molds of tires, not different speeds or ratings\n8 or whatever, light truck.     All the same across the board\n9 for all light truck tires.     Michelin LTX M/S 275s, 255s,\n10 265s, 245s, 255s, all of it.    So I need all that\n11 adjustment data, Your Honor.\n12                I also need the work instructions.    The\n13 adjustment data also has graphs and photographs that\n14 depict the exact -- the type of data that they see when\n15 they get the defective tires returned and they're going\n16 to issue credits or issue -- allow the client to buy a\n17 new tire, they take photographs and they analyze all that\n18 data and send it to two centers here in the United\n19 States.   And they put charts and graphs so it shows the\n20 trend of what they are seeing.   I don't have any of that.\n21                Also I need the work instructions of the\n22 training for the tire inspectors.    The tire inspectors\n23 don't get on first day on the job and know how to inspect\n24 a tire or to build a tire.    I don't have any of that,\n25 Your Honor.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0019\n\f                                                                14\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   I mean, it's -- they gave us absolutely\n2 nothing.     They waited six months now and they're offering\n3 something else with a caveat, which is, I will give you\n4 this but you can't do that.      No.   I'm not going to take\n5 any less than what I came at.      I mean, if it was me or if\n6 it was anybody that we know, you wanted to know why that\n7 tire came apart, Your Honor.      So I need all of those\n8 documents.     I have manufacturing defects, design defects,\n9 claims for manufacturing defects, design defects.       And\n10 so, Your Honor, I need exactly those documents for the\n11 defective design, defect in manufacturing, defect in\n12 inspection, defect warranty adjustment data.      Those are\n13 documents that absolutely are necessary for Plaintiffs to\n14 fairly adjudicate their claims, Your Honor.\n15                  THE COURT:   All right.   Response?\n16                  MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, let me first\n17 start off by saying that I'm probably the guy who hates\n18 discovery disputes worse in this courtroom other than\n19 Your Honor.    I've been representing Michelin for more\n20 than 15 years.    I almost never have hearings on discovery\n21 disputes.    This is the first one I've had in more than\n22 two years.    I've had -- I literally have had a handful\n23 except one case up in Wichita Falls where I had them over\n24 and over and over again about 12 or 15 years ago.\n25                  The reason that I don't have discovery\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0020\n\f                                                             15\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 dispute hearings is we work these things out with good\n2 and reasonable lawyers.     We work them out.\n3                   I'll submit to you, Your Honor, if you've\n4 read the briefing provided by the Plaintiffs lawyers in\n5 this case, you will know they're not interested in\n6 discovery in this case.     They're interested in a\n7 discovery dispute.     What they want to do is try to\n8 prejudice this Court against Michelin by citing orders in\n9 out-of-state cases where Michelin allegedly did things\n10 that they shouldn't have done.\n11                  If I was -- these folks are from Arizona.\n12 And if I was appearing in a case in Arizona, I would\n13 admit upfront I don't know anything about the Arizona\n14 rules, but I would sure enough find somebody who did know\n15 them.    And I would rely upon them to make sure that the\n16 rules were followed.\n17                  As the Court is aware, when these lawyers\n18 from Arizona got admitted pro hac vice in this case, they\n19 had to certify that they had read the Texas rules and\n20 were familiar with them and would follow them.    And I'll\n21 submit to you they have not done that in this case, Your\n22 Honor.\n23                  They also have a Texas lawyer on their\n24 pleadings, a lawyer I know very well from Corpus named\n25 Jim Reagan.    And Mr. Reagan has had cases against\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0021\n\f                                                              16\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Michelin over the years, not just in Texas but in other\n2 states.   I've got a current -- got a case with him now.\n3 He's very familiar with the Texas rules.      The other case\n4 I've got pending with him, which is up in Palmer County,\n5 right up between Amarillo and almost on the border of New\n6 Mexico, we didn't have any kind of a hearing on discovery\n7 disputes.     We got together and we talked about what he\n8 wanted and we worked out an agreement.\n9                  We basically begged these guys -- as you\n10 will see from the letters that we attached to our\n11 response, we have begged these guys to confer with regard\n12 to this motion, Your Honor, and they have -- they have\n13 thwarted us every step of the way.\n14                 The Texas rules require a conference.     The\n15 local Dallas rules are strong as horseradish on this.      As\n16 the Court knows, they have to schedule a conference to\n17 resolve the disputed matters.    They have to schedule a\n18 conference to resolve the disputed matters.     They have to\n19 have a substantive discussion of every item presented to\n20 the Court.   Before they come in here and burden the Court\n21 and take the Court's time, there is supposed to be a\n22 substantive discussion of every item.\n23                 Instead, what these fellows do is they\n24 write letter after letter after letter and make telephone\n25 calls, Where are our documents, where are our documents,\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0022\n\f                                                             17\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 where are our documents?     They are unyielding in what it\n2 is that they want and we can talk about the details if\n3 the Court is so inclined.\n4                  Even after they filed their motion to\n5 compel, we have still continued to say, hey, there's a\n6 requirement that you confer with us on this.     We want to\n7 do it.    We had a conference scheduled for a week ago\n8 today, September 1.     We had said, hey, we need to get\n9 together on a conference call and go through these\n10 discovery requests.    We had a court reporter lined up in\n11 order to do it.   It was going to be last Tuesday\n12 afternoon, which I remember well because it was opening\n13 day of dove season.    I was taking two of my boys out dove\n14 hunting.   So I was trying to figure out, how am I going\n15 to get this call in before I take them dove hunting.\n16                 And Mr. Shapiro, who is here, you haven't\n17 heard from him, but he works with Mr. Guerra.\n18 Mr. Blackerby talked and he said, hey, in order to be\n19 able to sell Mr. Guerra on this on having a call, I'm\n20 going to need some kind of a proposal from you.\n21                 So we worked hard, Your Honor, to put\n22 together a proposal.   We went through Plaintiffs' motion\n23 to compel point by point and we put together a proposal\n24 which we think is very reasonable to try to compromise\n25 the disputes that are set out in the Plaintiffs' motion\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0023\n\f                                                              18\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 to compel.     That letter is part of Exhibit C to our\n2 response to the motion.\n3                   Mr. Blackerby sent it to Mr. Shapiro I\n4 think via e-mail.     He almost immediately got a call back\n5 where Mr. Shapiro said, this proposal is BS.     He didn't\n6 use the abbreviation.     He called it BS and he said, if I\n7 show this to Mr. Guerra he will flip out.\n8                   Mr. Blackerby said, you need to respond to\n9 it.    We need to try to confer on this.   You need to\n10 respond.    And as I understand it -- I wasn't a party to\n11 the conversation, but Mr. Shapiro said, I will have you a\n12 counterproposal in 30 minutes.    We never got any such\n13 thing.\n14                  Given all this, Your Honor, the failure of\n15 these lawyers to follow not just the Texas Rules of Civil\n16 Procedure, but the local rules of the Dallas courts, I\n17 would urge the Court not to consider this motion today,\n18 but instead to order the parties to confer.    We were\n19 prepared to do it in the presence of a court reporter and\n20 that's the only way, frankly, that we would want to do\n21 it.   But I would urge the Court to order the parties to\n22 confer, at least to narrow the issues and see that\n23 they're submitted to the Court in writing or come back\n24 for a followup hearing.\n25                  I don't think that -- when parties don't\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0024\n\f                                                                  19\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 follow the applicable rules, they should not be able to\n2 take advantage of a ruling of the Court.\n3                   THE COURT:    Well, y'all go in the jury\n4 room and start conferring and let me know when you get\n5 through conferring and we'll look at this at that time.\n6                   MR. BULLION:    Could we -- could we -- I\n7 don't know, your court reporter may be tied up with other\n8 things, but we need a --\n9                   THE COURT:    She will be tied up.\n10                  MR. BULLION:    We need to make a record of\n11 it, Your Honor.\n12                  THE COURT:    Of the conferring?\n13                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n14                  THE COURT:    Why?\n15                  MR. BULLION:    Because we need a record of\n16 what's said.   If we're able to reach any kind of\n17 agreements, we need a record of what is said.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, we met with these\n19 folks more than 10 times, starting with Chris Blackerby.\n20 This gentleman was never involved, Your Honor.\n21                  THE COURT:    Whoa.   Whoa.   Whoa.   Whoa.\n22 Y'all are both here.   Have these guys working on it\n23 through y'all.    Y'all are the ones that are always with\n24 the ultimate say in it.   Y'all are here now.       Y'all are\n25 going to confer.    That's what you're going to do.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0025\n\f                                                              20\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR.

Thank you.\n2                 THE COURT:    If you can't trust each other,\n3 okay, we'll come back and you'll make your notes and\n4 we'll put on the record the different notes and we'll\n5 just kind of see how it goes.\n6                 MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n7                 THE COURT:    I think more highly of y'all\n8 than you think of yourself.     I think y'all will be able\n9 to know what you agree on and what you don't agree on.         I\n10 think y'all will figure out that and you'll be able to\n11 communicate that to the Court and I'll go from there.\n12 All right?\n13                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n14                MR.

Yeah.\n19                MR. BULLION:    Thank you.\n20                THE COURT:    I don't imagine y'all are\n21 going to agree on everything, but we'll deal with it.\n22                Nice accommodations in there.      It's good\n23 enough for the jurors.   I think there's a coffee machine\n24 in there.\n25                Mr. Fisher, make sure that gets working\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0026\n\f                                                                21\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 and --\n2                   MR.

We're back on the\n6 record in Cause No. DC-14-07255 Medina vs. Michelin.          All\n7 right.     What is the results of y'all's conferring?\n8                   MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, we went through\n9 Mr. Blackerby's letter dated September 1 of 2015 which is\n10 attached as Exhibit C to our response to the Plaintiff's\n11 motion and we can just take these items in the order in\n12 which they are set out and I think we'll need to have\n13 some additional argument.\n14                  THE COURT:    All right.\n15                  MR. BULLION:    We have proposed and I\n16 probably ought to give you a little bit of background on\n17 the tire, Your Honor.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    All right.    This was a\n19 Michelin LTX M/S in the size P25570R16 and I'm sure\n20 you've read the affidavit and briefing but this tire was\n21 about 11 years old at the time of the accident.       We have\n22 already produced the specs for this particular tire plus\n23 three.    There were three common green tires.      The common\n24 green tires are basically are just the same guts but\n25 different outside.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0027\n\f                                                                 22\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    Uh-huh.   Branded different.\n2                  MR. BULLION:    I'm sorry.\n3                  THE COURT:    Basically branded different.\n4                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.    There might be\n5 a -- this is a Michelin tire but in the Uniroyal or BF\n6 Goodrich world there might be a Uniroyal version or a BF\n7 Goodrich version and they're virtually -- from a\n8 performance standpoint they're the same, but the outside\n9 they're different.\n10                 MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor, just\n11 really quick.   If we are going talk about the agreement,\n12 we are going talk about the agreement.       If it's just the\n13 argument, I'll just sit down.\n14                 THE COURT:    Well, you can sit down.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    It's going to be the argument\n16 or it's only going to talk about the scope.\n17                 THE COURT:    Well, you know, I'll hear what\n18 I want to hear and then when I get tired I'll move on to\n19 something else.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n21                 MR. BULLION:    I was just going to try to\n22 give you a little flavor for what this dispute was about\n23 and then tell you where we are and maybe argue it when\n24 you're ready.\n25                 THE COURT:    All right.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0028\n\f                                                             23\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. BULLION:   So what we have already\n2 given them is the tire in question plus the three common\n3 greens, made in Dothan, Alabama which is where this tire\n4 was made six months before and after the production of\n5 this tire, which was the 31st week of 2001.    We agreed in\n6 our letter to expand that to the whole time this tire was\n7 produced.   It was about a six-year period sometime in '98\n8 to --\n9                 THE COURT:   Why not the LTX M/S line?\n10                MR. BULLION:   Well that -- the affidavit,\n11 I think, makes it clear, Your Honor.   The line is -- this\n12 is a marketing-type -- a marketing-type designation.\n13 It's been a round for 20 plus years.   It comes in a wide\n14 variety of sizes.   The designs are different.\n15                THE COURT:   Well sure it comes in\n16 different sizes.\n17                MR. BULLION:   The proof in front of the\n18 court -- the only proof in front of the court today, Your\n19 Honor, is the affidavit of Mr. Andy Price and it talks\n20 about the fact that the tires are different sizes or are\n21 different designs and that's certainly the case.\n22                We have -- we have -- we have offered to\n23 give --\n24                THE COURT:   Why that would not be somewhat\n25 relevant to the alternative design.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0029\n\f                                                             24\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. BULLION:   I'm assuming that the safer\n2 alternative design -- the alleged safe or alternative\n3 design is Nylon Calphalon.     That typically is the safe or\n4 alternative design in this case.     We have not gotten to\n5 the expert disclosure form, but I'm assuming that's what\n6 their safe or alternative design is.\n7                 THE COURT:   Well, I know, but when you say\n8 that the --\n9                 MR. BULLION:   Yeah, in the other point,\n10 Your Honor, is we have established via Mr. Price's\n11 affidavit that information on all of this is trade secret\n12 and there's not any counterproof on it.    And as the Court\n13 knows under the Supreme Court's decision in In re\n14 Continental General Tire, once we establish the\n15 information as trade secret then the burden shifts to the\n16 Plaintiffs to come in with evidence and show that it's\n17 necessary for a fair adjudication of the Plaintiff's\n18 claims.   They've certainly claimed with lawyer talk that\n19 information on other tire lines is necessary to a fair\n20 adjudication of Plaintiff's claim, but they haven't\n21 brought forward any proof at all with respect to that.\n22                We're willing to give up the -- we're\n23 willing to give up information on the tire in question\n24 because there is a protective order in place and we're\n25 willing to concede that information on the tire in\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0030\n\f                                                               25\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 question is necessary to a fair adjudication.     But when\n2 you get far afield and what they want, Your Honor, is '98\n3 all LTX M/S tires from '98 to 2012 from the affidavit\n4 we've looked at a six-year period from '98 to 2003 if you\n5 got all of those tire lines we're talking about 50 some\n6 odd different tires, 5,000 specs almost 20 million tires.\n7                   If you expand it to their scope this is\n8 one of Michelin's best selling tires in history.      They\n9 have been making it for 20 plus years.      LTX M/S, Your\n10 Honor, is to Michelin like Chevrolet is to General\n11 Motors.    It's a market.   And if you expand it to 150 to\n12 discover -- if I talk in between 50 and hundred million\n13 tires, maybe more than 100 million tires and they haven't\n14 demonstrated a need for them.     They haven't demonstrated\n15 that it's necessary to a fair adjudication of Plaintiff's\n16 claims.    That's really is the point that I'll come back\n17 to with regard to anything.\n18                  If you're trying to expand the scope,\n19 you've got to show a need for these documents.     They can\n20 do that.    They can come up with an affidavit from their\n21 tire expert and he can say, I need this that and the\n22 other.    In order to be able to prove my case I need this,\n23 that and the other and they have not done it.    They've\n24 got no proof whatsoever.     They could've submitted an\n25 affidavit or they could have had testimony.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0031\n\f                                                                26\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   As I said the only evidence before the\n2 Court is the affidavit.\n3                   THE COURT:    The trade secret affidavit.\n4                   MR. BULLION:    Sir?\n5                   THE COURT:    Right?   The only evidence is\n6 you say it's y'all's trade secret affidavit.\n7                   MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.   And it's got more\n8 than just trade secret.     It's got a lot of information --\n9                   THE COURT:    I understand but your\n10 argument.\n11                  MR.

Exactly right.\n22                  THE COURT:    What about that?\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your.   The case that\n24 you -- if I may refer you to Your Honor, Exmark case.

That's 20 million tires sold.       The specifications\n3 are much less than that.

Yes.\n8                  THE COURT:    He said that they've got an\n9 uncontroverted trade secret.\n10                 MR.

GUERRA:    Your Honor, he needs to be\n3 qualified to testify about that.\n4                   THE COURT:    Okay.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    Okay once he tells us that he\n6 is -- he says that he is a senior consultant.        Is he a\n7 tire builder, no.     Is he a tire designer, no.\n8                   THE COURT:    Wait.   Wait.   Does this all go\n9 to the point that you didn't have to come forward with\n10 any evidence because they didn't establish trade secret?\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    First, they didn't establish\n12 trade secret and secondly, Your Honor, second, I have the\n13 proof and the documents.      Every single one of these\n14 documents relate to light truck and tires.        Now they\n15 refuse to produce the documents and then they say you\n16 come up with evidence, but it's difficult to do, Your\n17 Honor.    But I know for a fact that this applies across\n18 the board aspect specification and warranty data.       How do\n19 I know that warranty data the adjustment data may tell us\n20 all the information about the tires.        Because on the Velo\n21 case.\n22                  THE COURT:    All right.   If y'all have an\n23 agreement, we'll take y'all up.        We'll break here because\n24 y'all will be what's left.\n25                  MR.

Y'all\n3 come up here.    Vielica if you will.\n4                  (A break is taken.)\n5                  THE COURT:    All right.   We're back on the\n6 record in Cause No. DC-15-07255.\n7                  All right.    I'm sorry I interrupted you\n8 counsel.\n9                  MR. GUERRA:    No problem, Your Honor.   It\n10 was good we took a breather.\n11                 Your Honor, we have that Velo case before\n12 this one and discovery on that case was end of with a\n13 lady by the name of Kate Helms from the same firm of that\n14 gentlemen Giles and I just found out when I was in there\n15 that she's involved also in the discovery of this case,\n16 this specific case.    So the Velo case was the LTX M/S\n17 from the same plant and was also from 2001, three weeks\n18 before so the Velo tire is a little older than this tire,\n19 three weeks old.\n20                 On that case we got production and that\n21 was a 265.   We got production on some 235s, 245s, 265.\n22 We got 16 rims, 17 rims.     This argument here is made for\n23 the courtroom today.\n24                 Now the point that we're talking about\n25 visible alternative design, this is what the Court of\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0035\n\f                                                                  30\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Appeals said.     What Defendants are confusing is they\n2 wanted to give us only the identical tires, the identical\n3 design.\n4                   THE COURT:    I understand.   I understand.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    -- as opposed to alternative\n6 design and this is what the Court of Appeals said back in\n7 2009; and this is the products liability case, trade\n8 secrets.     It's about vehicle aspects or whatever and it's\n9 about also a lawn mower.\n10                  Indeed.   Indeed.   Because products\n11 liability claimants must prove a safer alternative\n12 design, it would be absurd to limit the discovery to the\n13 specific model at issue because that would necessarily\n14 preclude alternative discovery and alternative request.\n15 It doesn't even make sense, you know, Your Honor.       I need\n16 to put alternative --\n17                  MR. BULLION:    I'm sorry.    I thought you\n18 were done with that.\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    I need to prove alternative\n20 design.    I need to prove awareness of the danger.     I need\n21 to prove visibility, all of that information is there.\n22 This millions and millions.      This is lawyer talk, Your\n23 Honor.    And going back to the affidavit that you demand\n24 and I check them because it's not a tire builder, not a\n25 tire manufacturer.    It doesn't say on the affidavit\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0036\n\f                                                             31\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 anywhere not a tire designer; didn't design this tire;\n2 was not a project manager; didn't work on the plant and I\n3 remember that name, Your Honor.    I remember that name\n4 because years ago I did a deposition in South Carolina at\n5 the Nelson Mullins office and who attended that\n6 deposition in addition to the four attorneys who were\n7 representing Michelin Vandy Price. He works on the\n8 litigation Defendant of Michelin.     I think he a\n9 paralawyer, you know, I know if he is a paralegal or a\n10 lawyer.   I don't know.   He is some type of individual on\n11 that tier which was 2014.   I got on the record he is\n12 currently employed in the legal department for Michelin.\n13                Now they have other people there and I\n14 checked to see if he was a professional engineer\n15 registered in South Carolina where Michelin is located at\n16 the MARC Center.   That's why he works at MARC Center\n17 because the litigation is at the MARC Center.   The\n18 lobbyist, the major lobbyist we choose them that\n19 testifies in all these case runs the litigation\n20 department.   Vandy works underneath him.\n21                So I checked South Carolina.   He is not a\n22 professional engineer in South Carolina so maybe he has\n23 some technical experience so I checked Alabama, Dothan.\n24 No, he is not registered as a professional engineer in\n25 Dothan.   He never claims to have worked at the plant in\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0037\n\f                                                                 32\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 Dothan, never been at the plant, never been a\n2 professional so I also checked if he was a professional\n3 engineer in Texas because that's where it -- he is not,\n4 Your Honor.     He is a guy that they wrote the affidavit\n5 and decided in the end but he's not qualified.       They have\n6 not established any qualifications for him to say that he\n7 knows the tire that the tires are differently\n8 manufactured that the tires are differently inspected and\n9 be there that it's a trade secret, Your Honor.       If it\n10 were, there was a protective order.     What is the harm.\n11 If the documents are not relevant shove them away.      Force\n12 them to return like I did on a prior case.       There is no\n13 harm.    But this woman is entitled to know why the tire\n14 came apart.\n15                  THE COURT:    All right.   Let me ask you:\n16 Different sizes and all that you have alluded it in the\n17 LTX M/S line, how many different sizes are we talking\n18 about?\n19                  MR. BULLION:    If you look at Mr. Price's\n20 affidavit, Your Honor.    Can I briefly respond?\n21                  THE COURT:    Well, why don't you answer my\n22 question first.\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    245, 255.\n24                  MR. BULLION:    There are -- if you look at\n25 that pair of 18 in Mr. Price's affidavit it says the LTX\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0038\n\f                                                                33\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 M/S line in it's common greens manufactured between '98\n2 and 2003 that's the time frame that we've offered to\n3 decide will encompass approximately 54 tire models built\n4 more than 5,000 tire specifications, approximately\n5 19.2 million different tires; that's for a six-year -- a\n6 six-year period.\n7                 THE COURT:    Well --\n8                 MR. BULLION:   Can I -- I definitely need\n9 to respond to what he said about the Velo at some point\n10 whenever you're ready.\n11                THE COURT:    Yes.   Well, tell me.\n12                MR. BULLION:   Velo involved a certain size\n13 of LTX tire also made at Dothan.     I wasn't in this case.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    I was.\n15                MR. BULLION:   But I do have the Rule 11\n16 Agreement.   There was a motion to compel filed.     There\n17 were no common greens to the Velo tire.      I'm saying it\n18 wrong, I'm sure.   In this case there are common greens.\n19 We've given up the common greens.      So just by way of\n20 compromise, Your Honor, Michelin agreed to give some\n21 other tires because he wanted -- the Plaintiffs wanted to\n22 compare different sizes so they agreed to give us as set\n23 out in the Rule 11 Agreement which I'll be glad to give\n24 you.   They agreed to give up six P metric tires and two\n25 light truck tires.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0039\n\f                                                              34\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  The letter specifically says this\n2 agreement is limited to this matter and may not be\n3 revealed outside of this case or used by any party in any\n4 matter.    It's not right to be doing what he just did.     It\n5 was a compromise like we should have compromise this case\n6 before we came in here today.\n7                  Mr. Price is -- he's got a mechanical\n8 engineering degree.     He worked at MARC, Michelin of\n9 America Research and Development Corporation, for a\n10 number of years as a tire designer.   He is now in the\n11 litigation department.   His qualifications are set out in\n12 the affidavit and the affidavit speaks for itself and\n13 it's uncontroverted.\n14                 MR. BLACKERBY:   Your Honor, can I just\n15 speak about the law real quick?\n16                 THE COURT:   Yeah.\n17                 MR. BLACKERBY:   They've cited the Exmark\n18 case.   We've cited in our brief the In re Cooper Tire\n19 which deals with this same exact issue and if you -- I\n20 don't know what they call it now -- shepherdize.\n21                 THE COURT:   Yeah.\n22                 MR. BLACKERBY:   If you go on Westlaw or\n23 whatever and you do that, guess what, decline(phonetic)\n24 to follow by In re Cooper that case and in In re Cooper\n25 what the court is deciding if when you get discovery on\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0040\n\f                                                             35\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 these other tires that don't have the same design that\n2 they're a different tire than the one at same issue and\n3 this was on a mandamus proceeding the Court of Appeals in\n4 Houston said no you don't because they established it as\n5 a trade secret and you have to -- and it doesn't because\n6 it's just relevant it has to be -- it's necessary for the\n7 fair adjudication of claims.    You use the same kind of\n8 affidavit that we have in this case proving it up as a\n9 trade secret.    And once you've done that the burden\n10 shifts.   And the language on the shifting burden is\n11 pretty pointed both by the Dallas Court of Appeals and\n12 the Houston.   Both Court of Appeals have talked about\n13 this and it's not supposed to be -- you can't satisfy it\n14 by general assertations [sic] of fairness or relevance.\n15 What you have to do is you must demonstrate with\n16 specificity exactly how lack of this information will\n17 harm the presentation of the case.    So you won't have a\n18 fair opportunity.    That's what they call for.   Once you\n19 establish it's a trade secret.    That's what we've done in\n20 this case so the burden has shifted.    We try to do some\n21 negotiation and part of the processes in these cases is\n22 all of these are trade secrets.    We know they need\n23 something so we negotiated with them.    That's why I have\n24 been yelling at them to please confer.    We'll come up\n25 with something.   But in the absence of it, we have our\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0041\n\f                                                              36\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 trade secret.    We've proved it all up as trade secrets.\n2                  THE COURT:   Well the conferring didn't\n3 work out so good.\n4                  MR. BLACKERBY:   Yeah, I agree with you.\n5                  THE COURT:   Well, I don't know why he\n6 would want to confer if it didn't work out so good.       It\n7 come to the same conclusion and the one tire is what\n8 y'all want to get.    Well, y'all didn't want to give that\n9 but --\n10                 MR. BLACKERBY:   Well we've expanded.\n11                 THE COURT:   Well you don't want to give\n12 any.   I mean that's --\n13                 MR. BULLION:   We recognize they're\n14 entitled to that, Your Honor.    And you know this is --\n15 this is not about discovery fights.   I've tried -- I've\n16 tried eight cases for Michelin similar cases to this\n17 involving tires and Blackerby and I are not into\n18 discovery fights.   We want to try the case.   And he's\n19 going to accuse us of just being discovery hounds, but we\n20 are interesting in trying cases.    We like to give them\n21 the documents they are legitimately entitled to, to allow\n22 them to prosecute their case and get on down the road.\n23                 We think given the State of the record\n24 though that what we've offered is more than fair.

I'm not from here.    I get it.   It's fine.\n10 It's par for the course.

I've got an e-mail back as a local\n15 lawyer accepting -- there was effective equivalent of a\n16 Rule 11 Agreement in Arizona.\n17                MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor.    Here\n18 is what it says:   This case they want us to be stuck to\n19 the same exact tire.    That's not the way.   This is good\n20 law earmark.   We can all read it.\n21                THE COURT:    He says Cooper tire chunked --\n22                MR. BLACKERBY:    Exmark is not a tire case.\n23 It didn't involve tracing.\n24                MR. GUERRA:    But it cites tire case\n25 reportedly all over the place.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0044\n\f                                                                  39\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    But he says Cooper tire\n2 specifically rejects it.\n3                   MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, it doesn't reject\n4 it.   What it does is it states in certain circumstances\n5 you need to be more specific.\n6                   THE COURT:    Yeah.\n7                   MR. GUERRA:    But this is discovery, Your\n8 Honor.     This is just discovery.      I cannot find what the\n9 alternative designs are.\n10                  THE COURT:    All right.   Tell me -- I can\n11 be persuaded that it's not limited to just this one tire.\n12 That having been said, there's got to be a basis for\n13 expanding it and you've got to identify for me what tires\n14 we're going into.\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    I was willing to reduce it to\n16 10 years, Your Honor, LLTM [sic]--\n17                  THE COURT:    I'm not talking about 10\n18 years.    I'm talking about first the tires.      We'll talk\n19 about the period of time --\n20                  MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, physical\n21 evidence.\n22                  THE COURT:    -- is a separate thing.\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    Physical evidence.   All --\n24 this is the inspecting of the manufacturer.        It relates\n25 to all light truck tires independently of rim size, line\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0045\n\f                                                                40\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 size, pressure speed rating.       One more example, Your\n2 Honor.     This is the Velo owners manual of the tire.      This\n3 owners manual of the tire.       This is the Medina owner's\n4 manual of the tire.     The same owner's manual, different\n5 sizes and it applies to all LTX M/S's, Your Honor, same\n6 exact document, same ID number, same version, all the\n7 same.     It is the same.   It is absolutely no different on\n8 the manufacturing, design and inspection of the tire.\n9 I'm entitled to take a look at that information.\n10                  Moreover, Your Honor, this is not my --\n11 this is not lawyer talk -- this is not part of lawyer\n12 talk.    These are the documents.      The owner's manual that\n13 Michelin puts out for the owners of these different\n14 tires, the 255's on this case the 265 on the Velo case,\n15 the same word, same documents; everything the same, Your\n16 Honor.\n17                  THE COURT:    Okay.   So I go the 265 to what\n18 else?\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    At least I have two right\n20 now.\n21                  THE COURT:    Well, I'm willing to go more,\n22 but you have got to have something.\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    The aspect specs again, which\n24 is the major document.\n25                  THE COURT:    Look.   I'm not going to go\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0046\n\f                                                                  41\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 solely by that document that says all passengers of light\n2 trucks.\n3                  MR.

I'm not done.\n11                 MR. BULLION:    It will probably be hundreds\n12 of millions, Your Honor.\n13                 MR. GUERRA:    I'm not done.     Your Honor,\n14 the general principal which is the basic document that it\n15 tells all these folks how to manufacture and inspect\n16 these tires and repair the tires before they leave the\n17 factory.   It specifically says that applies to all.\n18                 THE COURT:    I'm not giving you all tires,\n19 okay.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    No.   No.\n21                 THE COURT:    You've argued it.\n22                 MR. GUERRA:    No.   No.   No.   I only want\n23 the LTS and then --\n24                 (Simultaneous speakers.)\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor -- I think there\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0047\n\f                                                                 42\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 is a rule.     I think there's a little confusion that I\n2 think I can clear up very easily.      Aspect specification\n3 is a plant document.     That's a document that we use at\n4 the Dothan plant.\n5                  Mr. Guerra is right, it is not tire line\n6 specific.    The manufacturing documents by definition are\n7 not going to be.     They're going to apply to whatever\n8 tires are being made at the time at the plant.\n9                  THE COURT:    Whatever is rolling off.\n10                 MR. BULLION:    What we're talking about\n11 here in terms of this scope is design documents and\n12 adjustment data and he doesn't -- and, you know, with all\n13 due respect, Your Honor, we can't just willy-nilly expand\n14 this without any proof.    He doesn't have any prove\n15 whatsoever.    The proof is in the form of an affidavit or\n16 a live witness or a document that's admitted into\n17 evidence.   And he does not have any proof whatsoever that\n18 would support expanding beyond what we've offered to give\n19 which is this tire line during the time frame that it was\n20 made at Dothan, Alabama.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    That's not true, Your Honor.\n22 They preclude me from having the documents and then want\n23 to say that the documents prove that.\n24                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   No.   What he's\n25 saying is you hadn't put on any evidence for this\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                               MR 0048\n\f                                                                43\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 hearing.   Tell me what the evidence for the record what's\n2 the evidence --\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    The owners manual.\n4                 THE COURT:    What's the evidence?\n5                 MR. GUERRA:    The owners manual is the\n6 same.\n7                 THE COURT:    All right.   That tells us --\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    The aspect specifications\n9 it's a pile of documents, Your Honor, that state on the\n10 first page apply to all light truck tires.      The general\n11 principal its says on the page 17, I think, that applies\n12 to all light and truck tires.    They don't make this\n13 distinction.   This sounds letter on the Velo case, I saw\n14 it, Your Honor.   The warranty claims -- the document\n15 itself doesn't make a distinction.    The passenger -- this\n16 is from Michelin.    The warranty claims -- the thousands\n17 of warranty claims for the defect on the tires the same\n18 across the board for all light truck tires.      These are\n19 people on are the field after the tires left the plant\n20 and failed on the field, Your Honor.      So they prevent me\n21 from having documents that would prove that and then say\n22 come up with proof.\n23                THE COURT:    All right.   On those warranty\n24 claims, what are the sizes?\n25                MR. GUERRA:    Warranty claims --\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0049\n\f                                                                 44\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    Yeah, what are the sizes?\n2                   MR. GUERRA:    All I want is the LTX M/S's.\n3                   THE COURT:    I have already told you,\n4 you're not getting every LTX M/S.       That's too broad.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, give me the 225s\n6 through 265s.\n7                   THE COURT:    255 to 265?\n8                   MR. GUERRA:    225 to 265.\n9                   THE COURT:    225 to 265?\n10                  MR. GUERRA:    On Velo I have 235s, 245s --\n11                  THE COURT:     All right.    I get it.   I get\n12 it.\n13                  MR. GUERRA:    So all I want is the same,\n14 Your Honor.\n15                  THE COURT:    I get it.   You are going to\n16 tell me into something less.      Tell me why 225, 265\n17 wouldn't be similar.\n18                  MR. BULLION:    It's trade secret, Your\n19 Honor.    And he has not yet come forward with any proof.\n20 They're different design.      Each tire size is made to a\n21 different spec and Mr. Price is very specific in his\n22 affidavit.    In paragraphs 19 they really -- if you are\n23 inclusive 17 through 22.\n24                  THE COURT:    What's the next one after 225?\n25                  MR.

GUERRA:    235.\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yeah, there's a 225, 235.\n4                   (Simultaneous speakers.)\n5                   THE COURT:    All right.   235 to 265.     225\n6 is getting pretty small for my rudimentary knowledge of\n7 tires dealing with trailers and --\n8                   MR. BULLION:    And you're talking P metric\n9 tires as opposed to LT metric tires, I assume, Your\n10 Honor.    This is a P metric tire.\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    That's fine.    Your Honor.\n12                  THE COURT:    Yeah.   Now from there where do\n13 we go.\n14                  MR. BULLION:    Your Honor -- we.\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    We have an issue with the\n16 aspects.\n17                  THE COURT:    Wait.   Wait.   Wait.     I asked\n18 them.\n19                  MR. BULLION:    We are -- just going through\n20 the letter to Exhibit C to our response, Your Honor.\n21 We've agreed to produce the oldest available copies of\n22 the general principals, technical notes and not tire\n23 marks (phonetic), informed procedures.         It's my\n24 understanding that the Plaintiffs have agreed to accept\n25 that.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0051\n\f                                                                  46\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    The oldest they got.   It\n2 sounds like a pretty good start.\n3                   MR. GUERRA:    One down.\n4                   MR. BULLION:    Aspect specifications.    We\n5 have a dispute, Your Honor.       And that's the document he\n6 has shown you a couple of times.        Aspect specifications\n7 are used by the people that are called plaspectors\n8 (phonetic).\n9                   THE COURT:    Okay.   You would only have\n10 those as they relate to the sizes I gave you.\n11                  MR. BULLION:    Well, this is not a size\n12 issue.\n13                  THE COURT:    I understand what you're\n14 saying, but there's got to be a way to correlate it,\n15 isn't there?\n16                  MR. BULLION:    Here's what we typically do\n17 in these cases, Your Honor and what we think is\n18 reasonable.\n19                  THE COURT:    All right.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    There are aspect\n21 specifications that deal with a lot of things.        Aspect\n22 specifications are just documents that are reference\n23 documents for the people who are inspecting the tires\n24 after they're cured.\n25                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0052\n\f                                                               47\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. BULLION:   And there may be a blemish\n2 on the side wall.    There may be a white side wall that\n3 has got a blemish on it and they go to a category for\n4 that.\n5                  THE COURT:   Okay.\n6                  MR. BULLION:   Or maybe there's any number.\n7 It's a stack about this big.\n8                  THE COURT:   Yeah.\n9                  MR. BULLION:   And what we typically do and\n10 we've done in this case is we get the Plaintiff to\n11 identify the components of the tire that are at issue and\n12 we give them aspect specifications related to that.\n13                 For instance, the expert I assume they're\n14 using whom Mr. Blackerby and I are very familiar with has\n15 a theory where regard to steel belts.     There was a gap\n16 belt splice that should have been butt to butt.     There\n17 was not belt splice.\n18                 THE COURT:   Okay.   So ordinarily you would\n19 argue that your aspect material sheet should be limited\n20 to those that deal with the --\n21                 MR. BULLION:   Plaintiff's theories in the\n22 case.\n23                 THE COURT:   The ply, the belt.\n24                 MR. BULLION:   Well, not just that, but\n25 just any theory that have in the case we have done that\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0053\n\f                                                             48\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 and we have provided those to them.\n2                 THE COURT:    What about that?\n3                 MR. BULLION:    They are super trade secret,\n4 Your Honor.   And again, we felt we've proven them up as\n5 trade secret and we're happy to give them the ones that\n6 relate -- not happy to be blunt, but we are willing to\n7 give them the ones that relate to the case, but we don't\n8 think we should have to give them something that relates\n9 to a B when there's never a B allegation in this case.\n10 So that's our whole issue.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    So, Your Honor, on that issue\n12 you heard it has nothing to do with the tire size, the\n13 rim size or pressure size.    It's just across the board on\n14 light truck tires.    Therefore, on Velo I add exactly the\n15 same conditions that I had on this one minus a few.    So\n16 on the Medina case I have more conditions at issue than\n17 on the Velo case.    I got more than 60 aspect\n18 specifications, Your Honor.    I got more issues --\n19                THE COURT:    All right.   You need to tell\n20 me I'm not going to give just a blanket aspect sheet for\n21 everything in the world.    So how are these --\n22                MR. GUERRA:    His aspect specifications\n23 relates to a specific defect on the tire, Your Honor.\n24                THE COURT:    Okay.\n25                MR. GUERRA:    First we have --\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0054\n\f                                                                49\n           Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                        September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    I'm not giving them every\n2 defect.\n3                  MR. GUERRA:    Not saying that I wanted to.\n4                  THE COURT:    I understand.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    I want a little less than\n6 that but I know at least 63 apply because on the Velo\n7 case we have exactly the same issue a few less in fact\n8 and we got 63 of them so I want all of the Velo ones and\n9 you know it has nothing to do with the tire size.       The\n10 tire was manufactured on the same plant manufactured on\n11 the same year on the same line.     I should at least get\n12 those 63.   I think that's the ones I got in Velo plus I\n13 have more issues on this case and they have a specific\n14 problem.\n15                 THE COURT:    Well, no.   Look.   The way to\n16 go is not just to say, well, they did this in another\n17 case.\n18                 MR. GUERRA:    Okay, Your Honor.\n19                 THE COURT:    I might as well let Mr. Fisher\n20 wear the robe if I'm going do that and trade places.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    I can do that, Your Honor.\n22 They gave me the document.     This is the issue that I have\n23 and they also have it in Velo.\n24                 THE COURT:    Here's what I'm going to do to\n25 you unless can you talk me out of it, all right?\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0055\n\f                                                                50\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   MR. GUERRA:    All right.\n2                   THE COURT:    I kind of buy his argument the\n3 Plaintiffs got to say the defect that they're -- but then\n4 again that leaves no room for the possibility and that's\n5 part of discovery is taking a fresh look at it because\n6 there maybe have been something else.\n7                   MR. GUERRA:    That's fine.\n8                   THE COURT:    So how I do get there?\n9                   MR. GUERRA:    How I do get there, Your\n10 Honor?\n11                  THE COURT:    No how do I get there not how\n12 do you get there.    Because how you get there is going to\n13 be different from how I get there.      How you get there you\n14 would get all the aspects sheets --\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    And I should, Your Honor.\n16                  THE COURT:    And all the LTMS tires.   I get\n17 it.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    This has nothing do with\n19 specific lines.\n20                  THE COURT:    But you and I don't agree with\n21 that.\n22                  MR. GUERRA:    This has nothing to do with\n23 specific lines and I'm not done Tom.\n24                  MR. BULLION:    I was just going to\n25 volunteer a solution.    But we have a plane to catch and\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0056\n\f                                                               51\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 all.   I have a proposed solution.\n2                 THE COURT:    Well, let me hear it.\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    Go ahead.   Let me hear it.\n4                 MR. BULLION:    We talked in chambers about\n5 giving him a list of the aspect specifications and let\n6 him pick them and it came clear to me that he was going\n7 to pick all of them and I didn't think that was fair.\n8 I'll agree on behalf of Michelin give him a list and he\n9 picks the ones that are really at issue in the case.       If\n10 he comes back and picks all of them I think the Court\n11 ought not tolerate that and it seems like to me that's a\n12 fair compromise.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, again, the\n14 characterization is I'm the bad guy.      I gave him this --\n15                THE COURT:    You know I'm not taking it\n16 that way.\n17                MR. GUERRA:    That's nonsense.\n18                THE COURT:    I understand you are.\n19                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I told him what I\n20 needed.   I told him exactly what I needed.     I need all of\n21 the aspect specifications about blisters.     I need all of\n22 the aspect specifications about defects on the moldings,\n23 defects on the inner line, defects in the junctures\n24 between material, defects in the joints, defects\n25 regarding the sticking of the joint.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0057\n\f                                                                  52\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    And that's going to be\n2 everything, right?\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yeah.\n4                   MR. GUERRA:    No, no, it's not everything,\n5 Your Honor.     It's not everything.      I just know these\n6 documents but it's not everything.         Defects in the bead\n7 defects in the tread and they said to me, Luis you have\n8 an allegation about the bead.       I said, no.   And I said,\n9 but I always see when I go against tires the bead is\n10 always the issue so I'm waiting for that and I'm not\n11 willing to sit on it and then you make that allegation on\n12 the defense side.    There was a problem with the bead and\n13 I have to come back and ask for the documents.\n14                  THE COURT:    What's wrong with that?\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    Timing.   Timing.   Timing.\n16 It's been going on a year.      But, Your Honor, I asked the\n17 gentlemen here to provide me the factual basis of this\n18 defense that the tire -- tire abuse that's the defense,\n19 tire abuse.    And he has refused to give me the factual\n20 basis, Your Honor.    So I'm fighting in the dark.      I\n21 submitted three letters talk about not complying with the\n22 rules.    He said that's the expert disclosure.     It's not\n23 the expert disclosure.    It's the factual basis for the\n24 defense before the expert disclosure.       I need to know\n25 that.    I have allowed them to take deposition after\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                MR 0058\n\f                                                              53\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 deposition.   I don't know what I'm defending against so\n2 here is the problem.\n3                 THE COURT:   Hold on.   I get it over there.\n4                 MR. BULLION:   I'm sorry.\n5                 THE COURT:   I get his argument over there.\n6 You know I could see you put it together then all of a\n7 sudden your guy comes in and says, well, really.      It was\n8 something else totally out there and I had limited his\n9 discovery to where he can't even defend against that\n10 affirmative defense.\n11                MR. BULLION:   I understand what you you're\n12 saying, Your Honor.    I've never seen this being an issue.\n13 I will tell you generally what our position is in the\n14 case, but I don't think it is an expert issue.    We don't\n15 have company witnesses who talk about why this tire\n16 failed.\n17                THE COURT:   I understand.\n18                MR. BULLION:   Our position is this tire\n19 was 11 years old at the time of the accident and it\n20 should not have been in service.   There were five\n21 different tires on this vehicle.   It was an expedition.\n22 There was a light truck tire on it.    There were 4P metric\n23 tires and they were a horrible mess of tires.    These\n24 folks should not have been driving with these on this\n25 vehicle.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0059\n\f                                                                54\n          Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                       September 8, 2015\n\n\n1                  And there is going to be plenty of proof\n2 at the appropriate time that this tire was run\n3 underinflated.      Probably there's going to be proof that\n4 it suffered an impact which caused its failure.\n5                  MR. GUERRA:    No it's not.\n6                  MR. BULLION:    This is all expert stuff\n7 that --\n8                  THE COURT:    Well, wait a minute.   Wait a\n9 minute.   He just went through a litany of them.      They're\n10 all on the record.     You get aspect sheets related to --\n11                 (Simultaneous speakers.)\n12                 MR. GUERRA:    Wait.   I don't get all of it.\n13 Let me explain.    Let me explain why.\n14                 THE COURT:    No, I've been hearing you.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    If I may, Your Honor.   If I\n16 may.   If I may.   Tire inspectors, the verifiers, tire\n17 verifiers that do this day in and day out they cannot see\n18 all of these defects and they're experienced people.\n19 They need all the aspect specs to compare.      Why am not\n20 entitled to have that to compare to see if there's\n21 initial defects.     They are so precised as defects, Your\n22 Honor, that they don't even let you make color copies of\n23 the photographs.     They have to be colored laser copies of\n24 the photographs because of preciseness.       So I'm entitled\n25 to all the aspect specs for these truck tires so I can\n\n\n                      VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0060\n\f                                                             55\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 compare to see if there's any defects that we miss.      Why\n2 can't we have that for this specific tire, Your Honor?\n3 It has nothing to do with other tires -- this tire.      Give\n4 meet the aspect specs so my expert and we can take a look\n5 at what should be.\n6                 THE COURT:   What was the year of the\n7 manufacture of this tire?\n8                 MR. BULLION:   2001.\n9                 THE COURT:   What happens with all the\n10 aspect sheets for 2001, 2002 and 2000?\n11                MR. BULLION:   We probably don't have\n12 those, Your Honor.   What we typically would give would be\n13 the oldest available.    They're not going to be\n14 appreciably different.\n15                THE COURT:   All right.\n16                MR. BULLION:   The question is not the date\n17 I don't think in this case.   It's there are -- I don't\n18 know, this many --\n19                THE COURT:   Okay.\n20                MR.

BLACKERBY:    These documents are used\n15 in the plant to look at tires that have just been cured.\n16 These have not been used to look at tires that are 11\n17 years old and have been run down on a vehicle.\n18                 THE COURT:    Well, I understand.    But it\n19 would certainly go to discovery of issues that were\n20 potentially that were out there and that way they can\n21 look at these tires in the context of these defects.        But\n22 I didn't want to give 10 years of all that massive\n23 documentation because I just think it's irrelevant and\n24 too much now.\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Well the issue is trade\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0062\n\f                                                                57\n         Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                      September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 secret though.    That's the problem we have with this\n2 whole deal.   If we give them the aspect specifications\n3 that relate to the claims in the case and it can be\n4 relate to the defenses too that's fine.       There won't be\n5 anything I think on what I just said.      But if we give\n6 them the aspect specifications that relate to the claims\n7 in the case, then we'll concede that that's necessary for\n8 a fair adjudication of the claim.       When you get beyond\n9 that then we're back in the mode of the In re Continental\n10 tire case where we have proven this --\n11                 THE COURT:   Oldest two years.\n12                 MR.

I would urge the court on that if\n20 what he wants to do is be able to compare to limit it to\n21 a narrower date range like maybe plus or minus six months\n22 as opposed to it's going a ton of documents if you give\n23 him those sizes for the five years that we offered plus\n24 there's a reason -- there's a basis for the '98 to\n25 2003 time frame with regard to the tire in question on\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0063\n\f                                                               58\n            Plaintiffs' Amended Motion To Compel Hearing\n                         September 8, 2015\n\n\n1 this case because that's when it was made there.

That's going to be a whole lot.    I can come\n10 back to you and tell how it's -- just printing these\n11 specs takes a lot of time.\n12                  THE COURT:   All right.   What about six\n13 months before and the year after to start.\n14                  MR. BULLION:   Okay.   I don't know how much\n15 effort that will be frankly, but I will put six months\n16 before and one year after.\n17                  With regard to the aspect specification,\n18 Your Honor, I want to make sure that I'm being clear.\n19 Giving up two different versions of it --\n20                  THE COURT:   I don't know what you're\n21 talking about two different versions.\n22                  MR.

I wanted the manufacturer if it's\n22 not there it's not there.\n23                  MR. GUERRA:    Are you talking about the\n24 skin stock?\n25                  MR.

In re Continental General\n4 Tire is directly on point.\n5                  THE COURT:    You're going to tell me how\n6 you get there on that.\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    Coca-Cola doesn't kill\n8 people.     These tires kill people, Your Honor.   We are\n9 talking about the ability to hold materials together.        We\n10 have a claim for that.    We cannot know whether or not\n11 that product can do it.    You can't test.   You can't do\n12 anything.    You can put the claim out there, but you can't\n13 do anything about it.    You cannot conduct any discovery.\n14 How is that fair?

That's what I'll do.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0074\n\f                                                                  5\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    Concerning Your Honor --\n2 here's the problem that I have in a nutshell.      On\n3 March 30th you gave us until December 15 to produce the\n4 expert opinions.     That is about from March 30th -- I'm\n5 sorry -- April 30th.    You gave us -- on April 30th you\n6 gave us the Court's scheduling order until December 15th\n7 to produce the expert's opinions.     And that is, Your\n8 Honor 229 days.\n9                 Of those 229 days I am supposed to conduct\n10 discovery, get the information.    I have not been able to\n11 do that.   I was here on May 11 asking for documents.\n12                THE COURT:    I understand.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    I've been here on September\n14 8th asking for --\n15                THE COURT:    So what is it that you want to\n16 do?\n17                MR. GUERRA:    I those documents and I want\n18 the documents they promised to produce.      And so they\n19 promised prior to the hearing to give me -- that's the\n20 letter to us -- general principals, the technical notes,\n21 the tire nonconfirming procedures and the oldest\n22 available tire building training document for tires.\n23 Then they came to the hearing on September 8th and they\n24 promised again that I would get all that stuff.     Then\n25 they wrote a letter to you on September 17th saying\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0075\n\f                                                                 6\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 again, despite that proposal on September 1st to produce\n2 additional documents Plaintiffs used a --\n3 (unintelligible) --their offer, despite that we agree\n4 during the hearing to produce the documents any way.         So\n5 three times they have told them.        They told us, they told\n6 you, they've made judicial declarations.       We're going to\n7 produce them.     I don't have them.     I don't have -- all I\n8 have out of those documents, I have the general\n9 principal.    That's it.\n10                  They produced incompletely the tire\n11 nonconforming.    There's no qualifications on what they're\n12 going to produce.    There's no qualifications.    We will\n13 produce --\n14                  THE COURT:    Well, but isn't this part of\n15 what we all, I mean what whey went through?\n16                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your Honor.\n17                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    I don't have the documents.\n19                  THE COURT:    Well, I'm sure they're going\n20 to say we're waiting on the order and y'all don't agree\n21 to the order.    I'll go over the order as soon as we get\n22 the transcript.    And if this creates a problem for the\n23 December, your time will be extended.      That's the way\n24 it's going to be.\n25                  MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I don't want to\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0076\n\f                                                                  7\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 lose my trial date.     I do not want to lose my trial date.\n2 I have spent 70 percent of the time -- 70 percent of the\n3 time -- some this I've been up to today 158 days of those\n4 229.     This is the traditional traditional litigation\n5 strategy of this company.      On May 11 when I was here I\n6 stated that I'm already having problems, Your Honor.        I\n7 know that's the way they work.      So out of my time that I\n8 have to conduct discovery on the merits of the case, I\n9 have spent 70 percent of my time --\n10                 THE COURT:    Yeah, but if your concern is\n11 over the amount of time you have to commit to accomplish\n12 your discovery, you're not going to have a problem with\n13 that.\n14                 MR. GUERRA:    Okay.   Okay.   All I need is\n15 the documents really so can I conduct my discovery.      In\n16 the meantime --\n17                 THE COURT:    As soon as I get the\n18 transcript, I will read it over and do the order since\n19 y'all couldn't agree to what the rulings were.\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Some of these documents they\n21 claim, Oh, we agree to produce them so and it's not even\n22 part of the order.    We agreed to produce them.     No, it's\n23 got to be on the order because they promised they would\n24 produce them.   So if they don't produce them and when I\n25 find through the witnesses they didn't produce these\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0077\n\f                                                                  8\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 documents, I can come back here and talk to you about\n2 these matters, Your Honor.\n3                  MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, it's not correct\n4 that we're waiting on an order to produce documents.\n5 It's not correct.    We have produced --\n6                  THE COURT:   Well, if you produced all\n7 those that he's got his poster on and he'd said that\n8 y'all agree to produce then there's nothing to argue\n9 about.\n10                 MR. BULLION:   He is wrong, Your Honor.       He\n11 is wrong.    We made a proposal as the Court will recall a\n12 week before the hearing on September 8th we made a\n13 proposal.    He has excerpted part of it on the board that\n14 he has got there.   And it was we will produce certain\n15 documents in an effort to resolve this motion to compel\n16 and you withdraw your motion to compel.      They didn't\n17 accept it.   They called it BS as you'll recall.    They\n18 didn't accept the offer.\n19                 Despite that we came in, in good faith at\n20 the hearing and we said we'll agree to produce these\n21 documents.   We have produced almost 5,000 pages of\n22 documents.   Now we have produced the documents.\n23                 THE COURT:   Are you saying that you have\n24 already gave him what he is talking about on that poster?\n25                 MR. BULLION:   Yes.   That's what I'm\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0078\n\f                                                               9\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 saying.\n2                 THE COURT:   Okay.   Then he can say what he\n3 wants.    If you've already gave it him, you gave it to him\n4 and you will be sitting good.     He don't think you did and\n5 he's going to have to prove that.\n6                 MR. BULLION:   The only thing, Your Honor,\n7 is I understand that the motion for sanctions that he\n8 filed only relates to thing that are not things the Court\n9 ordered us to produce, but things that we voluntarily\n10 offered that we would produce.   We have not produced\n11 documents relating to the other tire sizes that the court\n12 ordered because, again, we are waiting on the order on\n13 that.\n14                THE COURT:   I understand.\n15                MR. BULLION:   Aspect specifications,\n16 expanding aspect specifications, we have not produced\n17 that.\n18                THE COURT:   I understand.\n19                MR. BULLION:   But with regard to the\n20 documents that we said in that proposed Rule 11 Agreement\n21 that we will produce on September 1 even though he didn't\n22 accept it, we have produced those.    There are certain of\n23 those documents that he is complaining about in the\n24 motion that don't exist that we have said it in our\n25 responses.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0079\n\f                                                                 10\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Sounds easy.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    I wish it was.\n3                   MR. BLACKERBY:    We agree I think it should\n4 be easy, but it has not been.\n5                   MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, it's absolutely\n6 not true.   They have not produced a single technical\n7 note.   It's right here; not a single one, not a single\n8 one tire nonconfirming --\n9                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Well, how are you going\n10 to prove that?\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    They have told me.    They have\n12 told me they have not produced them.\n13                  THE COURT:    Have y'all not produced a\n14 single technical note?\n15                  MR. GUERRA:    Not a single technical note.\n16                  MR. BULLION:    Technical notes, Your Honor,\n17 are referred to in certain aspect specifications.       You\n18 will recall briefly at least what the aspect\n19 specifications are.    They're the documents that --\n20                  THE COURT:    Yeah, I remember --\n21                  MR. BULLION:    Class spectors use in the\n22 final finish department.      Certain of the aspect\n23 specifications have technical notes associated with them\n24 certain of them don't.   The ones that we have produced in\n25 the case today, he did not.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0080\n\f                                                              11\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    It's an easy question.   He\n2 says you have not produced a single technical note.\n3                 MR. BULLION:    We have, Your Honor.\n4                 THE COURT:    You're saying, yes, we have.\n5                 MR. BULLION:    There are no technical notes\n6 associated with the aspect specifications we have\n7 produced today.   If we --\n8                 THE COURT:    Okay but if there are just\n9 none because there is none created then that's why you\n10 have none.\n11                MR. BULLION:    We've said that in our\n12 responses.   The Court has ordered that we produce\n13 additional aspect specifications --\n14                THE COURT:    Yeah, and you're waiting for\n15 an order.\n16                MR. GUERRA:    All of them.\n17                MR. BULLION:    And when we do that --\n18                (Simultaneous speakers.)\n19                THE COURT:    I understand.\n20                MR. GUERRA:    Here we are, Your Honor.     He\n21 said he will produce them.    He told you --\n22                THE COURT:    No.   No.\n23                MR. GUERRA:    He said I will produce all\n24 the documents that he had here.\n25                THE COURT:    And he has.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0081\n\f                                                              12\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    He hasn't.\n2                 THE COURT:    He says on his aspect size\n3 those don't have technical levels.\n4                 MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.\n5                 THE COURT:    On the remaining ones he is\n6 waiting for the order that there are some that have\n7 technical notes.\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.\n9                 THE COURT:    I don't know that to be\n10 factually true or incorrect.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    In general, Your Honor, there\n12 are no qualifications here or here or in the courtroom.\n13 There were no qualifications.\n14                THE COURT:    Well, no, I'm not going to\n15 suggest -- I'm not going to entertain that they agreed to\n16 produce every technical note that they've ever had or\n17 anything -- that's a little broad.\n18                MR. GUERRA:    No, Your Honor.   It's\n19 concerning the aspect specifications.\n20                THE COURT:    That's what I just said.   He\n21 gave you the aspect specifications.   He said they don't\n22 have technical notes.   The other ones are subject of the\n23 order.   And he says soon as the order comes down, they'll\n24 be some that have technical notes.    I don't know if\n25 that's true.   I'm just saying that's what he's telling\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0082\n\f                                                                  13\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 me.   Isn't that what you're telling me?\n2                   MR. BULLION:    That's exactly right, Your\n3 Honor.\n4                   THE COURT:    All right.    You may know\n5 different but you need to give me proof.\n6                   MR. GUERRA:    If we came here during the\n7 oral argument and the court ordered for them to produce\n8 all of the aspect specifications it's on the record.           And\n9 the aspect specifications --\n10                  THE COURT:    That's one of the things y'all\n11 disagree with.    That's one of the things y'all disagree\n12 with.   That's why there's not an order signed.       You think\n13 I ruled certain ways.   He thinks I ruled other ways.\n14 We're going to get the transcript.         And if you're right,\n15 then he may have a problem.      If he's right the way he\n16 heard it, then what he's telling you --\n17                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, part of the\n18 problem is they have the documents.        We don't have the\n19 documents.\n20                  THE COURT:    I know that.\n21                  MR. SHAPIRO:    So you're telling us to\n22 prove what we don't have.      How do we do that?\n23                  THE COURT:    No.   No.   You said you've got\n24 no technical notes.    He says I understand for the aspect\n25 specs that we've given you voluntarily --\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                               MR 0083\n\f                                                                14\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. GUERRA:     They gave us nine aspects,\n2 nine, Your Honor.\n3                  THE COURT:    Exactly.   That's fine.   He's\n4 saying there's no technical notes for those.       Now if you\n5 can prove, yes, there are.       There are technical notes for\n6 all those then you would be showing me that what he\n7 saying is not correct.     He says the other things that\n8 would include and have technical notes are subject of the\n9 order.\n10                 MR. GUERRA:     Your Honor, they play this\n11 game in every single litigation parsing things that were\n12 said.    Your Honor, it's the strategy that they use, Your\n13 Honor.    The general note --\n14                 THE COURT:    What do you want me to do?\n15 You want me to take this and say you've got to give them\n16 some technical notes because --\n17                 MR. GUERRA:     All of the technical notes;\n18 not some, all of them.    All of it, Your Honor.\n19                 THE COURT:    I done asked you.   If your\n20 argument is they have got to give you every technical\n21 note that has ever flown past Michelin no matter what,\n22 that would be a little broad.\n23                 MR.

That's where you and I -- that's what you and\n4 I are doing.    I get it.   I hear your argument.   You want\n5 me to accept as a fact your position on what I've\n6 ordered.    He wants me to accept as a fact their position\n7 on what I've ordered.\n8                  He says if their position is right, he's\n9 given you all the aspects --\n10                 MR. GUERRA:    No, he hasn't, Your Honor.\n11 He hasn't.\n12                 THE COURT:    Show me one piece of evidence\n13 for the aspect sizes he's given you, technical notes\n14 exist and he didn't give it to you.\n15                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, I came here on\n16 September 8th because I don't have the aspect\n17 specifications that I need.     We wasted another month on\n18 this nonsense that have 200 aspect specifications.       We\n19 have already heard this argument, Your Honor.      You\n20 ordered them produced -- what's clear as daylight.\n21                 THE COURT:    Y'all don't agree to what I\n22 ordered.   As soon as I get the transcript, I'll read it.\n23 One of y'all is going to be right and one of y'all is\n24 going to be wrong.   Maybe y'all will both be a little\n25 right, y'all both will be a little wrong.    Any way you\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0085\n\f                                                                16\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 will get an order.     And if there are -- if it comes the\n2 way you think I've ordered, then he probably has a lot of\n3 technical notes from what you're telling me he needs to\n4 give.\n5                 If it comes out the way he thinks the\n6 ruling was, he says he's good and you will be getting\n7 technical notes because some of the information that he\n8 thinks I ordered will be associated with technical notes,\n9 right?\n10                MR. BULLION:   Exactly.\n11                MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, on the tire\n12 building training, we don't have any of them.      These\n13 folks that start at Michelin they don't just start\n14 building tires.   They're trained.   We don't have any of\n15 them, not a single one.\n16                THE COURT:   Any what?\n17                MR. SHAPIRO:   The tire building training,\n18 how they build the tires.\n19                MR. BULLION:   We given them a ton of --\n20                (Simultaneous speakers.)\n21                MR.

We have referenced in our\n25 supplemental discovery responses what we have produced\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0086\n\f                                                                17\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 specifically.    Without an order from the Court we\n2 produced 3,000 approximately more pages of documents\n3 since that hearing.     We've referenced in our responses\n4 what we produced and they can go -- if they're willing to\n5 read it, they can go and find the documents we have\n6 produced.     We have produced our builder.    We've build\n7 machine setup type documents and tire builder training\n8 documents.\n9                  THE COURT:   You said you got no tire\n10 builder training.\n11                 MR. BULLION:   Your Honor --\n12                 THE COURT:   Here is the way we are going\n13 to handle that.   You know what you sent them.     Bates\n14 stamped --\n15                 MR.

Send them the Bates Stamp range\n19 where you say tire training.\n20                 MR.

SHAPIRO:   We want the orientation\n9 documents.\n10                 THE COURT:   No.   No.   You started off with\n11 tire training information.\n12                 MR.

We produced a lot of documents.      We\n17 produced them even before we supplemented our discovery\n18 responses --\n19                 THE COURT:   If they're Bates stamped just\n20 tell them ranges.\n21                 MR. BULLION:   I am.\n22                 THE COURT:   And then you're going to look\n23 at that and if none of that is tire training information,\n24 bring it to me.   If it's not tire training information, I\n25 guess you overlooked and it's going to be a problem.

My apologies.\n6                   These folks here -- for instance, Your\n7 Honor.    They say that they produce all these documents.\n8 They don't produce the most important.        That is the\n9 tactic.\n10                  THE COURT:    Okay.   We are waiting on the\n11 order.\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    So the tire nonconforming\n13 procedures we know for a fact they are missing.      First of\n14 all, we just got them 14 days ago, but they're missing\n15 all of the reference documents contained on the ones that\n16 they produced.    They proved TNC2s and 3s but they didn't\n17 produce the reference documents associated with it.        In\n18 addition, Your Honor, they didn't produce TNC4s and 5s.\n19 They claim they didn't exist then.\n20                  Now they have to deal with those\n21 complaints at the same time at the time that the tire was\n22 manufactured which were already complaints and after the\n23 tires left the factory.    Those are 4s and 5s.    So --\n24                  THE COURT:    What do you want me to do?\n25                  MR.

I'm going\n4 to go through the transcript.      I'm going to give you that\n5 order.   This wasn't part of the order.       All of this that\n6 you're bringing up wasn't part of --\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    No.    Because they agreed with\n8 it.   They agreed to produce them and here I am again\n9 another 58 days into --\n10                 THE COURT:    He just told me he produced\n11 them.\n12                 MR.

I promise you.\n22                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n23                 MR. BULLION:    We have asked them, what is\n24 your problem?   What is it that you think we haven't\n25 produce and they don't respond.       When they finally put in\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0090\n\f                                                                21\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 their motion for sanctions what they claimed we hadn't\n2 produced, the TNC4 and 5, we wrote a letter and said,\n3 Hey, it here is why you don't have TNC4.       We were able to\n4 erase original equipment tires.      This is a replacement\n5 market tire.     Here is why you don't TNC5.    It didn't\n6 exist at the time.\n7                  We have explained this to them and asked\n8 them to withdraw their motion for sanctions yet they\n9 don't do it.\n10                 The reason, Your Honor, there are so many\n11 miscommunications in this case.     We feel like everything\n12 needs to be put in writing and we have requested and that\n13 I'm going to stick with that position.\n14                 THE COURT:    I can't blame them.\n15                 MR.

They refused to take\n17 the calls, refused to take the calls even discuss it.\n18                 THE COURT:    That's all right.   Send it in\n19 writing then.    I've been in your shoes then send it in\n20 writing.\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, we have send them\n22 in writing.    They know exactly what we want.    They just\n23 hide the ball and then pretend that we gave you 5,000\n24 documents.    None of them include this nonsense.    It's\n25 missing, Your Honor.   They do this on every game.

GUERRA:    I don't.\n5                 THE COURT:    We went through all of that\n6 because you said we've got all of these things they're\n7 supposed to give us.   They didn't me and went through a\n8 whole big hearing.    I made an order.    Y'all don't agree\n9 with what that order was.     I'm going to go through the\n10 transcript and I'll give you the order.\n11                He says they're going respond.    I'm sure\n12 they are because they don't have much choice and then you\n13 will know where you are.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    On the Velo case which they\n15 refer to it several times.    It was a very similar tire\n16 which was LTX M/S manufactured at same plant different\n17 size was a 265 as opposed to 255, but other than that was\n18 exactly the same.   The tires are exactly manufactured the\n19 same way.\n20                I got many more aspect specifications,\n21 many many more and I have the same exact defects plus\n22 more on this one.\n23                THE COURT:    So maybe when I do my order\n24 and they do their response based on the order you will\n25 have that same treasure troll.

GUERRA:    Your Honor, I just want what\n3 was ordered here after we had the oral argument about\n4 that matter and I want the matters that they promised me\n5 that they will produce so I didn't put it on the other\n6 argument and I think I am entitled to that.         There is\n7 absolutely no qualifiers anywhere about what they're\n8 going to produce and they now after we did that -- they\n9 do this in every case, Your Honor.\n10                THE COURT:    Wait a minute.      We're going\n11 round and round.    He said they produced it.      You say they\n12 didn't.\n13                MR. GUERRA:    He didn't.\n14                THE COURT:    Well what's the proof.      He\n15 says they don't exist.\n16                MR. GUERRA:    No.    No.   No.   What they say\n17 is that they didn't exist at the time, but there has to\n18 be some way to deal with that matter; complaints after\n19 the original equipment for the original equipment\n20 customers.   It's the same tire.     So I need to --\n21                THE COURT:    Look.    Here's the deal.   He\n22 says on the record they don't exist.       They don't exist.\n23 Bring me in one that show they don't exist and that's\n24 going to somewhat problematic for him.\n25                MR.

He says no they don't.\n3                  MR. GUERRA:    Can you just incorporate on\n4 the order for them produce the documents so then I have\n5 an order that I can go against.\n6                  THE COURT:    What documents?\n7                  MR. GUERRA:    All tire nonconfirming\n8 procedures to be produced, technical notes to be produced\n9 concerning these aspect specifications.       That's all I\n10 need and the tire building documents.      Just put it in the\n11 order, Your Honor.\n12                 MR.

He keeps referring to\n16 agreement.   The September 1 document was written as a\n17 Rule Agreement.   It has a place for a signature for\n18 Mr. Guerra and Mr. Shapiro here.     They never signed it.\n19 It says in exchange for the production agreed above --\n20                 THE COURT:    It doesn't matter.   Like I\n21 said it's not a Rule 11.     It's not signed.\n22                 MR. BULLION:    There was not an agreement\n23 despite that we produced a lot of documents.\n24                 MR. GUERRA:    What not signed but he came\n25 into the court and said that I'm going to produce them.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0094\n\f                                                               25\n                    Motion To Strike Hearing\n                        October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    If he did that it's on the\n2 record.\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    It's on the record.   And\n4 then --\n5                 THE COURT:    Y'all obviously don't agree.\n6 Why do we keep going around on this.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Because he is saying -- now\n8 he is trying to go back on his word.      He said it in open\n9 court.    He then said it here despite what we said.   We\n10 agree to again to produce the documents any way.\n11                THE COURT:    You said it's on the record.\n12                MR. GUERRA:    It's on the record.\n13                THE COURT:    Okay.   I told you I'm going to\n14 go based on what the record was.\n15                MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, they're here\n16 asking for sanctions against us and it doesn't relate to\n17 the Court's ruling.   They say in footnote note one of\n18 their motion it does not relate.     This motion does not\n19 address the documents the Court ordered Michelin to\n20 produce.\n21                THE COURT:    The Court can award sanctions\n22 based upon representations and, you know, representations\n23 in writing you know that's possible.     But right now I\n24 don't -- until I read that transcript, you're telling me\n25 all that matter that's on your posters it was stated on\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0095\n\f                                                               26\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 the record.\n2                  MR.

GUERRA:    I am going produce them any\n6 way.\n7                  THE COURT:    Well then we'll deal with\n8 that.     If it's on the record, it's going to be there.\n9                  MR. GUERRA:    During the hearing --\n10                 THE COURT:    If it's not on the record --\n11                 MR. GUERRA:    During the hearing we\n12 agree -- during the hearing we agree to produce the\n13 documents any way.    He wrote it.     That's a letter to you,\n14 Your Honor.    That's the representation he made to the\n15 Court.\n16                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                 MR. GUERRA:    It's here.   It's on our\n18 record right here.\n19                 THE COURT:    I'll look at it.   When he gets\n20 an order he is waiting on the order.      He's a got right to\n21 do that.\n22                 What else?\n23                 MR. BULLION:    We've got a motion to\n24 designate responsible third parties, Your Honor, the\n25 first one we've ever had to have a hearing on in my\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0096\n\f                                                                 27\n                      Motion To Strike Hearing\n                          October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 memory.   I've done hundreds of these.     This is the first\n2 one we've had to have a hearing on.     But if you want to\n3 take that up, we'll be glad to do that.        Mr. Blackerby\n4 will address that.\n5                 THE COURT:    Is it timely?\n6                 MR. BULLION:    Oh yeah.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes, sir.\n8                 MR. BULLION:    It's been set.    It's been\n9 filed a long time ago.\n10                MR. BLACKERBY:    It's pretty simple pretty\n11 straightforward.    We've -- the owners and the operator of\n12 the vehicle were the Rico family.    We went out and\n13 deposed the Ricos and about 10 days later we filed a\n14 motion to designate them as responsible parties.       This is\n15 what happens in every single tire case.       The allegation\n16 is they properly maintained the tire and the allegation\n17 is the driver failed to maintain control of the tire.         We\n18 should be good.    The objection that they are allowed to\n19 make is we didn't complete it.    The sufficiency to\n20 special exceptions.    They filed an objection and instead\n21 of doing that, their objection is it is baseless and\n22 unsupported and they have given a lot of testimony\n23 primarily from actually all leading questions by the\n24 Plaintiffs saying you took care of the tire, right, yes\n25 and all these kind of sayings and basically that's their\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0097\n\f                                                                 28\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 objection which is not a proper objection you know.\n2                   THE COURT:   Not for -- not at this stage.\n3                   MR. BULLION:   Not at this stage.\n4                   THE COURT:   Maybe at the time of\n5 submission --\n6                   MR. BLACKERBY:   Exactly.\n7                   THE COURT:   -- when the evidence is before\n8 the court as to whether or not there's anything that\n9 would raise the issue of responsibility but not just on\n10 just designating.\n11                  Response.\n12                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, first of all\n13 Mr. Blackerby actually asked the questions about the\n14 tire.   He didn't like the answer.    The driver and the\n15 owner of the vehicle and the tires say I had the tires\n16 checked.   So they're just completely -- it's sad to say\n17 they're making up facts.      There's no evidence of poorly\n18 maintaining the tire and it goes hand and hand with our\n19 motion to strike claims of tire abuse.\n20                  They won't disclose it.     We keep asking\n21 them.   You know it's just trial by ambush.     We keep\n22 asking them.   We provide the vehicle.     We send them the\n23 tire.   They had the tire for over a month.     They looked\n24 at everything.    We gave them the vehicle.    They deposed\n25 the driver, all the folks, nothing.     There's no tire\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0098\n\f                                                                29\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 abuse.     We ask -- we're taking fact discovery.    We're\n2 taking depositions.    They claim there's tire abuse.       They\n3 don't tell us how, where, when, nothing.      They have to\n4 plead some specificity under the rule that we cited, Your\n5 Honor.\n6                  And even if there is a claim of only\n7 checking the tire once, how does that cause the tire to\n8 fall apart.    There's no causation.   Even if can the take\n9 the pleadings as true so their motion to designate does\n10 fail.    There's no evidence of responsibility.    We've\n11 asked them for it.\n12                 THE COURT:   All right.\n13                 MR. BLACKERBY:   I'll respond, again, Your\n14 Honor.    The amount evidence is not at issue here.   It's\n15 whether we've pled it.   What we've pled is they checked\n16 the air pressure one time and they never had the tire\n17 inspected during the time they own the tire.      That's our\n18 allegation.   We'll see what the evidence says but that's\n19 what they testified to during his deposition.      A lot of\n20 the other things and a lot of the other evidence that\n21 we'll have to support either tire abuse claim or service\n22 history is going to come from expert.     We've looked at\n23 the tire and we do expert disclosures.     They'll get those\n24 in theory just like we'll get what their expert says\n25 caused the tire to fail when we get their experts and\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0099\n\f                                                               30\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 disclosures.     So that's the rest of it and they'll get\n2 all that.     That's the way these cases go and we are\n3 following procedure today.\n4                  MR. GUERRA:   Your Honor, we have that\n5 motion on that issue.     I would like talk a little bit\n6 about it.\n7                  And the is these folks said it was tire\n8 abuse but it's like saying your tire failed because there\n9 was a defect.     That wouldn't fly.   I need to give some\n10 specificity.    The same goes for them.    They say tell us\n11 what it is.    What is the tire abuse -- anything; not all\n12 the evidence.    They don't have too much, but they need to\n13 put facts.    They have not put a single fact, not one.\n14                 Maintenance demanded the tire for a month.\n15                 THE COURT:    All right.   I understand your\n16 argument.    I understand your argument.\n17                 MR. GUERRA:   And on that month it went to\n18 the shop; undisputed evidence.    So all this lack -- even\n19 if that were the case-- lack of maintenance for a month\n20 even though it went to the shop as recommended by\n21 Michelin, checked the tires, looked at them and said that\n22 they all look good; how does that go into the fact that\n23 the tire came apart and there was tire abuse?     We don't\n24 have one single fact of tire abuse.\n25                 THE COURT:    All right.   I'll look at it.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0100\n\f                                                                31\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1                 What else?\n2                 MR. GUERRA:    We have a motion.\n3                 THE COURT:    Yeah, y'all had your motion on\n4 the deposition.\n5                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes.    We need to depose that\n6 folk that came here with the affidavit.\n7                 THE COURT:    On the trade secret stuff.\n8                 MR. GUERRA:    Yeah.    And, Your Honor, we\n9 just got that stuff.\n10                THE COURT:    You get to depose him.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you.   Your Honor, I'm a\n12 little concerned about deposition dates.      Because the way\n13 this has been going, no documents, no witnesses, no\n14 contacts, I sense it's going to be a lot of problems to\n15 get deposition.   I have sent them a letter on Friday --\n16                THE COURT:    When are you going to take\n17 this guy's deposition?\n18                MR. GUERRA:    I'm sorry, Your Honor.\n19                THE COURT:    When do you want it?\n20                MR. GUERRA:    I want it -- when can we do\n21 it?\n22                MR. BULLION:    The next couple of weeks.\n23                THE COURT:    Is that a problem?\n24                MR. BULLION:    I have to check his\n25 availability, Your Honor.    I don't need to be there for\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0101\n\f                                                               32\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 them, but certainly I would think we would get it done by\n2 the end of the month.\n3                  THE COURT:    All right.    Today is the 5th.\n4 It's ordered to be taken on October 23rd at 10 a.m. at\n5 your offices.\n6                  MR.

Yeah, I love\n10 Greenville.\n11                 THE COURT:    All right.    At the Greenville,\n12 South Carolina, unless y'all agree to something\n13 different.    So that way you got plenty of time to work.\n14                 MR. GUERRA:    Thank you.\n15                 THE COURT:    If you can work out something,\n16 wonderful.    If you can't, Greenville, South Carolina\n17 10 a.m. on the 23rd.\n18                 MR. GUERRA:    Can I ask you one last thing,\n19 Your Honor?    I think it's the last thing that we have to\n20 talk about.    When you issue your order, would you please\n21 put a time in which they have to produce the documents\n22 with the order?\n23                 THE COURT:    Sure.\n24                 MR.

I will do that.\n2                  MR. GUERRA:    A week will be more than\n3 plenty of time.\n4                  THE COURT:    I will do that.\n5                  MR.

Both sides got any proposed\n9 orders.     If not, just e-mail one to Francine to both\n10 sides.\n11                 MR.

You're not striking\n13 our defense entirely.\n14                 THE COURT:    Oh I thought y'all were\n15 arguing that on the designated responsible third parties.\n16                 MR.

Our position is it's\n18 expert stuff.\n19                 THE COURT:    Well, that's more in the\n20 nature of special exception, right, whether or not you've\n21 been given fair notice.\n22                 MR.

I don't have any notice\n23 about what --\n24                 THE COURT:    I don't than I'm going strike\n25 it, but -- y'all are probably going have to plead a\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0104\n\f                                                                35\n                     Motion To Strike Hearing\n                         October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 little bit more.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    The way that this typically\n3 plays out in these cases, Your Honor, is the expert\n4 will -- and I will just give you an example.         There is a\n5 concept known as compression roots in the B area of a\n6 tire that there is proof according to some experts that\n7 the tire has been run underinflated or overdeflected.          If\n8 there is evidence on this tire of that which I think\n9 there is our expert in his report would say this tire has\n10 a history of overdeflected operation and here are the\n11 conditions.   It's all expert stuff.       This isn't a -- this\n12 is --\n13                  THE COURT:    But still basic notice in\n14 pleadings in Texas they are probably entitled to\n15 something a little more than a whatever y'all said this\n16 has been used.\n17                  MR. GUERRA:    Tire abuse.\n18                  THE COURT:    Just like the flip side the\n19 Plaintiff says you are negligent.\n20                  MR. GUERRA:    Exactly.\n21                  THE COURT:    You know in a special\n22 exception, you're going to have to put a little bit more\n23 meat on the bone than you're negligent.        The same thing\n24 with it's been abused.\n25                  MR. BLACKERBY:    Right.   And that's not\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0105\n\f                                                               36\n                      Motion To Strike Hearing\n                          October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 where the pleadings are right now.      I will tell you what\n2 we've alleged is that they were negligent in the\n3 maintenance and the driving of the vehicle.      That all\n4 came in before we went out and deposed Ricos.     And then\n5 once they deposed them, we did our motion to designate\n6 responsible third party, where we specifically said\n7 they're negligent because they didn't check the pressure.\n8                 THE COURT:    Yeah, but that's a motion for\n9 designated parties --\n10                MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, he is rearguing\n11 the same motion.\n12                THE COURT:    That's not your pleading.\n13                MR. BLACKERBY:    I'm actually -- I'm not\n14 actually regarding the same motion.\n15                THE COURT:    I understand what you are\n16 saying.\n17                MR. BLACKERBY:    We put it out there.\n18                THE COURT:    What answer you are you on?\n19 Do you have an amended answer?    I don't remember what\n20 iteration you are on, on your plea -- are you still on\n21 your original answer?\n22                MR. BULLION:    No.   I think it's our\n23 amended answer.    But also they want is for us to update\n24 our responses to request for disclosures I think is the\n25 vehicle they have been going at.     That's what they have\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0106\n\f                                                             37\n                  Motion To Strike Hearing\n                      October 5, 2015\n\n\n1 this cited in this motion.\n2                THE COURT:    No.   The discovery rules\n3 control when you have to supplement and all that.\n4 Basically I take that as a special exception.    You need\n5 to amend your pleadings within 10 days on what abuse is.\n6                MR. SHAPIRO:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n7                MR.

GUERRA:    Out of the six motions, I was\n21 wanted to see if we can maybe the motions that we filed\n22 to quash your depositions and the motion that you filed\n23 to quash Wischhusen's deposition maybe that's something,\n24 you know, in between this hearing we can take a\n25 five-minute break, we can go outside and talk and work it\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0112\n\f                                                                 5\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 out.\n2                   MR. BULLION:    Well neither one of those\n3 are set for a hearing properly.         We didn't get -- you\n4 sent a notice of the hearing on your motion to quash\n5 yesterday afternoon which is not timely pursuant to the\n6 Texas rules.    But the way the Texas rules work is the\n7 depositions are automatically quash if you file a motion\n8 within three days of the notices so I'm happy to take\n9 that up or not whatever your preference is on that, Your\n10 Honor.\n11                  THE COURT:    I would certainly rather hear\n12 those type of issues rather than make either one of y'all\n13 come back or spend additional time on something that's,\n14 you know, motions to quash depositions are easy to talk\n15 about.   It doesn't take a lot of -- not a lot of facts a\n16 lot of time, you know.   So I would rather deal with that\n17 today if we can get it dealt with.\n18                  MR. GUERRA:    Tom.\n19                  THE COURT:    But y'all can take a break and\n20 talk about it.    I am going to be here.      It don't matter.\n21 I'm willing to entertain them.      If he's going to make a\n22 notice if Mr. Bullion makes a notice objection then we'll\n23 deal with that.   But I would prefer to deal with those\n24 deposition issues.\n25                  MR.

We said this is\n14 Mr. Bustillo.    He's the codefendant and the trooper and\n15 some fact witnesses and we've been trying since July to\n16 get those scheduled and we surprisingly we have not been\n17 able to do that.\n18                 MR.

So y'all are going to talk about it and\n22 we'll take that up after we discuss it but we will get\n23 that set up today.\n24                 MR.

GUERRA:    I'm sorry.\n21                THE COURT:    We are going to do the motions\n22 and then you will break to do the quash stuff.\n23                MR. GUERRA:    No problem.   So then we also\n24 have the motion for the --\n25                MR. SHAPIRO:    The Bates range regarding\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0115\n\f                                                                  8\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 the tire training.\n2                   MR. GUERRA:    Did you hear that, Tom?\n3                   MR. BULLION:    Yes.    We've given you the\n4 Bates number for the tire builder training documents and\n5 I don't know -- I don't if you want to take that up or if\n6 you're good with that.\n7                   MR. SHAPIRO:    No, Your Honor.   And Tom, in\n8 fact that was October 5th when the Judge ordered the\n9 Bates range to be produced we got it on Friday because\n10 the first time it was set on Monday he gave us the wrong\n11 Bates numbers.    So, you know, we looked at the Bates\n12 numbers and we looked at the Bates ranges and these are\n13 not tire training documents.      I have for example, the\n14 first Bates range document that Mr. Bullion represented\n15 was a tire training document.      It's a work instruction.\n16 It doesn't mention training anywhere on there, Your\n17 Honor.\n18                  THE COURT:    Wait.    What about that,\n19 Mr. Bullion?   I want you to give him the tire training\n20 documents.\n21                  MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, we've given them\n22 the documents that are used to train tire builders.        A\n23 lot of them are documents like work methods and things\n24 like that.   They don't say tire builder training on them,\n25 but those are the in fact the tire builder training\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0116\n\f                                                                9\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 documents that were available and that we used and given\n2 them.\n3                   THE COURT:   Well, it don't have to say it\n4 on there.    But if it is what was used and what was relied\n5 upon as documents for that purpose, it doesn't have to be\n6 headed or title that.    So I don't have a problem with\n7 titling.\n8                   MR. SHAPIRO:   I don't have a problem with\n9 title either.     The problem is in previous cases by the\n10 way, in Velo, these same documents were produced and they\n11 were called work instructions.     Now they're calling them\n12 tire building training.    They're not tire building\n13 training and I can show it to and you there is nothing\n14 about how the tire is built.\n15                  THE COURT:   Hold on.   What you want was\n16 the tire training, right?\n17                  MR. SHAPIRO:   That's right.\n18                  THE COURT:   All right.   He's saying he\n19 provided that.    What Bates range, Mr. Bullion?\n20                  MR. BULLION:   Let me look real quick, Your\n21 Honor.   This is as we discussed before this -- this was\n22 in our supplemental responses and in our response to a\n23 motion for sanctions.   I've got to pull this motion up.\n24 It is -- let's see, in the 3362 through 3515 it's about a\n25 little over -- a little over 150 pages of documents.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0117\n\f                                                               10\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:   And that's supposed to be\n2 responsive to the tire training.\n3                  MR. BULLION:   Yes, Your Honor.\n4                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, they're not tire\n5 training.\n6                  THE COURT:   Okay.   But what do you want?\n7 Do you think I know?\n8                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, the problem is\n9 we don't have the documents.      They have the documents.\n10 So I can't tell what you they look like because they've\n11 never produced them to us.\n12                 THE COURT:   I understand but --\n13                 MR. SHAPIRO:   And that's the problem.\n14 These are not tire training documents.\n15                 THE COURT:   Wait a minute.   Listen to me.\n16 All right.    He has represented to you that's what they\n17 are, right?    So he is bound by that representation.    You\n18 say it's not.    Okay.   There's a way to deal with that,\n19 right?\n20                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah, there is a way to deal\n21 with that which kind of segues into the next motion which\n22 is about a person who is responding to discovery, the\n23 employee, because the employee would know --\n24                 THE COURT:   Wait.   Wait.   You're getting\n25 ahead of the deal.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0118\n\f                                                              11\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. SHAPIRO:   I'm not trying to get ahead.\n2                  THE COURT:   I know.   Understand y'all are\n3 in this.    Y'all know.   Y'all know what these documents\n4 are.   I don't know.   So I hear this gentlemen from\n5 Michelin, Mr. Bullion say, Gave these, gave everything we\n6 got responsive what you told us to you give on tire\n7 training.   Here they are Bates range M3362 through 3515\n8 easy for me to identify, know what those are.     It can be\n9 not a problem.    And you say that's not what that is.      And\n10 he says, Yeah, it is.    So where do we go from there?\n11                 MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, might I suggest\n12 that we've offered the deposition.     They've sent us a\n13 they sent us several letters asking for depositions of\n14 representatives of Michelin and we offered the deposition\n15 of the manufacturing witness from Dothan and I've offered\n16 a couple of days for it and they have not yet noticed it\n17 and it seems to me that they have -- if they don't think\n18 these are in fact tire builder training documents the way\n19 for them to develop that is to ask the manufacturing\n20 witness from Dothan what was used to train tire builders\n21 back in this time frame and are these the documents and\n22 are there other documents out there and I'm assuming at\n23 some point they're going to take their deposition.\n24                 THE COURT:   Not a bad idea.\n25                 MR. BULLION:   I offered them\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0119\n\f                                                                12\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 November 13th --\n2                  THE COURT:    Hold on.    Would you hold on --\n3                  (Simultaneous speakers.)\n4                  THE COURT:    Can you not hear me?\n5                  MR. BULLION:    I can hear you, Your Honor,\n6 mostly.\n7                  THE COURT:    Can you not hear me?\n8                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor, I can hear\n9 you right now.\n10                 THE COURT:    Well I asked you to stop\n11 talking in the middle of that.\n12                 MR. BULLION:    Again, I apologize, Your\n13 Honor.   I apologize if I talked on top of you.\n14                 THE COURT:    All right.    Now what about\n15 taking that deposition?\n16                 MR. GUERRA:    Here is the problem.   Here is\n17 here is the manufacturing guy and we don't have documents\n18 that we have questions to ask.      Not these documents.     The\n19 other documents the aspect specifications.\n20                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   Listen to what he's\n21 say.   Listen to what he's saying.\n22                 MR. GUERRA:    I did.\n23                 THE COURT:    No, you didn't.   Because he is\n24 saying you trot down here and you take the deposition of\n25 the person who knows whether or not these are the\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0120\n\f                                                              13\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 documents.\n2                 MR. GUERRA:    I understand, Your Honor.\n3                 THE COURT:    Okay.   That's not the same\n4 thing as what you're talking about.      Now that would be a\n5 costly deposition.\n6                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes.\n7                 THE COURT:    And if that guy were to say\n8 this range that has 33 through 62 -- 3362 through 3515.\n9 If he were saying, for instance, that's some of it or not\n10 all of it or if he says, no, that's not the tire building\n11 training documents, Bullion is going to pay for all of\n12 that.   He is going to pay for your time to go down there.\n13 He is going to pay the whole turnkey deal because he's\n14 the one making the representation that these are the\n15 responsive documents and then he's saying, Well, if you\n16 don't believe me, go talk to the people and they'll tell\n17 you that these are the responsive documents.     And if you\n18 go down there and you go through that and the guy says,\n19 No, it's not all the responsive, Bullion is going -- he\n20 is the one making the representations to the Court.\n21                Now if they say, yes it is and you're like\n22 good and you're able to come in and prove somehow that\n23 they're not, it starts getting pretty serious Rule 215\n24 stuff in Texas.\n25                MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, the issue is, you\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0121\n\f                                                                14\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 know, we're trying to schedule the deposition and we know\n2 the man, Mr. Riley, in Alabama, but there's other\n3 documents unrelated to the training documents related to\n4 the inspection of the tires that we've been able to\n5 receive them.     So our thinking -- and that's Mr. Bullion\n6 I give him the dates, no.       Until we get the documents we\n7 cannot be setting depositions of these folks willy-nilly\n8 until we get the basis for us to prepare to go take the\n9 depositions.    I understand what you're saying.\n10                  THE COURT:    I don't think you do.\n11                  MR. GUERRA:    It's a little different.\n12 You're saying, Luis, go down there.      Talk to this guy and\n13 if anything --\n14                  (Simultaneous speakers.)\n15                  THE COURT:    It's calling the bluff.\n16                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes.   Yes.   I get it.\n17                  THE COURT:    It's calling the bluff and\n18 like I say I do this from the position that y'all both\n19 have been involved in these cases before.       Y'all both\n20 know these documents.   It's not like you've never seen\n21 these documents before.    It's not like Mr. Bullion has\n22 never seen these documents before.       You know it's calling\n23 somebody's bluff.\n24                  For instance from Mr. Bullion's position I\n25 leave room for the possibility that he's like they know\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0122\n\f                                                                15\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 these are the documents and they're just trying to get\n2 that Judge down there to throw something else in when\n3 they know these are the documents.     Maybe that's what he\n4 believes.    And then he's calling your bluff.     He's\n5 calling your bluff saying, Well, you don't think so.\n6                 Hook'em on down here.   Talk to this.\n7 Because you know you know he gone say, yeah, that's all\n8 we got.   Those are the documents.    And then you didn't\n9 get anymore from me through this exercise than what he\n10 gave you.   I leave that as a possibility.\n11                MR. GUERRA:    Okay, Your Honor.\n12                THE COURT:    The flip side is you've seen\n13 it.   You've seen it and they're stepping right into your\n14 analysis.\n15                MR. GUERRA:    And my caveat is, Your Honor,\n16 is, you know, I get the additional documents concerning\n17 when this gentleman is supposed to testify about when the\n18 Court makes the ruling and then I will go back and depose\n19 him about that.\n20                THE COURT:    See how that works.\n21                MR. GUERRA:    No problem.    No problem.\n22 That will be fantastic.\n23                THE COURT:    That's the way it works around\n24 here.\n25                MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.     I\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0123\n\f                                                                 16\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 guess we're done with that and the only question is to\n2 set the deposition of Mr. Riley.\n3                  THE COURT:    It should be quick.\n4                  MR. GUERRA:    Yep.   Thank you, Your Honor.\n5                  THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, how long you said\n6 this guy would be available.      They can hot foot it on\n7 down there.     You ought to be able to have this guy\n8 available certainly within the next 30 days for sure.\n9                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor.    I don't\n10 think that's a problem at all.     I will say that I told\n11 Mr. Guerra and Mr. Shapiro that we only want to put these\n12 witnesses -- I've got four maybe five witnesses\n13 identified to cover their topics and we only want to put\n14 them up once so I would like to --\n15                 THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, hey, hey, hey.\n16 We all got wants and needs in life.\n17                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.   May I proceed,\n18 Your Honor?    What I was going to say is --\n19                 THE COURT:    I told you how we're going to\n20 do this little part of it.     We move in small fight bites\n21 around here.    Simple things for simple minds.\n22 Unfortunately you got the simple mind on the bench here.\n23 So you're going to do things in small bites and\n24 simple-minded ways, all right?\n25                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0124\n\f                                                             17\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:   It's like Sisyphus pushing\n2 that rock up the hill.     It's just what you have to\n3 endure.   I'm not trying to the level --\n4                 MR. BULLION:    What I would like to say on\n5 the record if possibly, Your Honor, is once we get a\n6 ruling on that on that motion to compel then we will be\n7 in a position to produce the additional documents and\n8 they can ask all of these witnesses whatever questions\n9 they want to ask them with regard to all of the documents\n10 we produced.   So that is what I would like to make sure\n11 it's clear on the record.\n12                THE COURT:   Well, we'll see how it goes.\n13 We'll see how it goes.    I've got a way to go about this.\n14 It might not be the way you'd go about it.    It might not\n15 be the way opposing counsel would go about it, but it\n16 will be the way I go about it.\n17                So I don't want to get distracted with all\n18 of these other things.    It just confuses the simple mind.\n19 I have a dispute on whether or not these responsive\n20 documents have been produced.    You've been very kind to\n21 identify for the Court exactly the range and what they\n22 are and you feel very confident that those are the only\n23 ones that are responsive to the point you told him, come\n24 on down and talk to the guy.    They can either take up\n25 that invitation or not.    If they choose not to, then they\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0125\n\f                                                                18\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 have what you give them and we move on to the next issue.\n2                   Now what's the next thing?   I told you how\n3 we're going to handle this little issue about the motion\n4 to compel on the tire building training documents.         That\n5 is done and closed for the record.\n6                   MR. SHAPIRO:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n7                   MR. GUERRA:    If we can go on a segue that\n8 David was talking about.       We would like to discuss that\n9 motion regarding identification of the individuals that\n10 provided them discovery responses and the financial\n11 information.\n12                  Did you hear that, Tom?\n13                  MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n14                  MR. SHAPIRO:    And, Your Honor,\n15 Mr. Bullion's brief outlines the Exxon case which talks\n16 about -- in that case by the way the Plaintiff served\n17 several depositions and in fact they were depositions.\n18 Deponents were produced from Exxon to talk about\n19 documents.\n20                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n21                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Now what the Court denied\n22 was the production of an attorney of record to discuss\n23 the documents.    That's not what we want.    We want the\n24 employees' bios --\n25                  THE COURT:    Right.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0126\n\f                                                               19\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  MR. SHAPIRO:    For example --\n2                  THE COURT:    Okay.    But what if the person\n3 in charge just happens to have a J.D. from one of the\n4 finer legal institutions of this country.        Just because\n5 you're a lawyer doesn't mean -- just because you have a\n6 law degree doesn't exclude you --\n7                  MR. SHAPIRO:    That's why the Court was\n8 very careful and the Court of Appeals wrote the attorney\n9 of record.\n10                 THE COURT:    Right.\n11                 MR. SHAPIRO:    And we're not looking for\n12 work products here.   We're looking for folks that\n13 actually do this day in and day out who can identify, you\n14 know for example those glass aspects.       These are how they\n15 come to that.   Those are those glass specters that\n16 Mr. Bullion talks about all the time.       They actually use\n17 those documents on the field.\n18                 THE COURT:    All right.   You want a person\n19 who has knowledge of that information with the\n20 corporation.\n21                 MR. SHAPIRO:    That's right.\n22                 THE COURT:    Mr. Bullion, what about that?\n23                 MR. GUERRA:    Regarding the responses for\n24 discovery specifically who is the guy that told these\n25 folks.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0127\n\f                                                              20\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:   I got it.   What about that?\n2 Can you tell them that?\n3                 MR. BULLION:   I'm not sure I got\n4 everything.    What I understand the Plaintiffs are asking\n5 for is somebody to be deposed about our discovery\n6 responses and we've in our brief in Texas law I think\n7 it's very clear that that is not permitted.     It's work\n8 product and it's not -- it's not permitted to get to\n9 basically do discovery into discovery.     I heard him\n10 mention of class spectors (phonetic) and I am not sure\n11 what that is related to.\n12                THE COURT:   I don't hear them asking for\n13 that.   What you're hearing is different from what they\n14 are saying.   Run that by me again.   What is it that you\n15 want.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:   We want the folks that\n17 identify for example we asked for the aspect\n18 specifications.\n19                THE COURT:   You want the person who has\n20 knowledge of the aspect specifications.\n21                MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah.\n22                THE COURT:   Right.\n23                MR. SHAPIRO:   Yeah, who took those\n24 conditions.   They asked for conditions at issue that\n25 we're claiming.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0128\n\f                                                                21\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    Yeah.\n2                 MR. SHAPIRO:    And they have gave us nine\n3 aspect specifications.\n4                 MR. GUERRA:    We want that the guy.\n5                 THE COURT:    You want to talk to that\n6 person who made that judgment that decision.\n7                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Exactly, Your Honor.\n8                 THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Bullion, what\n9 about that?\n10                MR. BULLION:    They're asking for somebody\n11 in the legal department, Your Honor.      The people who make\n12 decisions as to what documents are responsive to\n13 discovery requests are either lawyers in the legal\n14 department at Michelin or their representatives that are\n15 either engineers or paralegals.      And so what they're\n16 asking for is what I just said; discovery about\n17 discovery.\n18                If they want to talk to somebody about how\n19 the aspect specifications are used in the plant then the\n20 plant manager would be able to get into that.\n21                THE COURT:    No.\n22                MR. BULLION:    But if they want to get into\n23 why you picked these aspects specifications as opposed to\n24 others, that's a lawyer's decision or a lawyer's\n25 representative's decision and it's clearly work product\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0129\n\f                                                                  22\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 under Rule 192.5.\n2                  THE COURT:    That's not what they're asking\n3 for from what I'm hearing.      Here is what I'm hearing that\n4 they're asking for and they'll tell me if I've stated\n5 this wrong.     What they're asking for is based upon the\n6 answers to the discovery somebody has knowledge and went\n7 through a process of giving the responsive information.\n8 They want to know who is that person in the company that\n9 has knowledge about these -- this particular aspect\n10 information.\n11                 MR. BULLION:    I -- I think we're on the\n12 same page, Your Honor, but the people who have knowledge\n13 about that would have the use of the aspect\n14 specifications that would be the people at the Dothan\n15 plant.\n16                 THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                 MR. BULLION:    We offered a witness who can\n18 address the aspect specifications.        The question of --\n19                 THE COURT:    Hold on.    Hold on.    Hold on.\n20 That's what y'all want, right?\n21                 MR. GUERRA:    We want that but we certainly\n22 want the person that for these responses said these are\n23 the ones.   It cannot be --\n24                 THE COURT:    No.   No.   No.   No.   That's\n25 getting kind of gray area.     Now listen to me.

Remember small minds.    Small minds.   Simple ways\n2 for small minds.    You're going to go down there and\n3 you're going to talk to these people that he's saying\n4 know all about these aspects and then you're going to ask\n5 them how come I was given these and he is going to say, I\n6 don't know.    I don't know.     And you're going to have all\n7 kinds of good little questions about, Well, did you give\n8 this information to somebody and who did you give this\n9 information to somebody and then you will find out who\n10 the filter is.    And then maybe we will take the next step\n11 once we know what that filter is, right?\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    Sounds good, Your Honor.\n13                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Sounds good, Your Honor.\n14                  MR. GUERRA:    Simple things for simple\n15 minds.\n16                  THE COURT:    I know it tends to make things\n17 more costly, but sometimes that's only way to get to the\n18 truth.\n19                  MR. GUERRA:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    One thing I also want to\n21 point out for the record is Your Honor ordered at least\n22 from the bench that we produce the oldest version of all\n23 of the aspect specifications and you said at Dothan and\n24 once you entered an order on that and we produced those\n25 and I think why certain ones were selected to be produced\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0131\n\f                                                                24\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 in discovery probably becomes moot as well.\n2                 THE COURT:    I disagree.    I disagree.   I'm\n3 not sure about your framing of that order, but the\n4 purpose was not just to say give them old irrelevant, you\n5 know, material but to give them the current responsive\n6 material and the only reason there would be an issue\n7 about old or how far back or dated is just to set a date\n8 on how far back.    Not saying you only give them old,\n9 irrelevant, out of date and, you know, none --\n10 nonmaterial information.    I don't think my order said\n11 that.\n12                MR. BULLION:    No.   No.   Your Honor, that\n13 wasn't what I was saying.    It was that this was a really\n14 old tire.   This tire was built in 2001 and Your Honor you\n15 wanted us to produce the oldest version of all of the\n16 aspect specifications in use at Dothan.      And that's at\n17 least the way we understood the order.      I think there's\n18 some disagreement on that.    So once you enter your\n19 written order, then we'll produce the oldest version.\n20 Whether they were actually in effect at the time this\n21 tire was built or newer than that I think will depend on\n22 the aspect specifications?\n23                THE COURT:    Huh, that's an interesting\n24 dance.\n25                MR. BULLION:    Well just all the aspects\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0132\n\f                                                                25\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 specifications, Your Honor, are not dated the same.         They\n2 don't have the same date on them.       Some might have been\n3 written in the late '90s.       Some might have been written\n4 in the late 2000s.    They don't have all the same date on\n5 them is all I'm trying to say.\n6                   THE COURT:    Yeah, I think what the court\n7 would probably be interested in is up until the time of\n8 the production of this particular aspect and going back a\n9 reasonable period of time all of those responsive\n10 documents not just the oldest and not just the current\n11 but it would be really from the time of production back a\n12 reasonable period of time.      Have we not done that with\n13 that order?\n14                  MR. GUERRA:    It has not been written down,\n15 Your Honor.\n16                  THE COURT:    You just got the language.\n17                  MR. BULLION:    You know Michelin has a\n18 document retention policy, Your Honor, and, you know, I\n19 think there's some confusion on what -- on what it is\n20 that you ordered us to you produce.     Because my\n21 understanding of what the oldest version of the aspect\n22 specifications in use at Dothan I think that's different\n23 than what you are saying now and I think Mr. Guerra and\n24 Mr. Shapiro have a different understanding as to what you\n25 ordered too --\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0133\n\f                                                               26\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                  THE COURT:    Yeah, listen to me.\n2                  MR. BULLION:    -- we will simply have to\n3 see the written order and see what it is that you ordered\n4 us to produce.\n5                  THE COURT:    All right.    Listen to me all\n6 right.\n7                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n8                  THE COURT:    Do you have any confusion when\n9 I say for the aspect of this tire that's the subject of\n10 this litigation I'm ordering production from the time of\n11 production of that tire back, the aspect documents on\n12 that tire or that aspect.\n13                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, I understand what\n14 you're saying, Your Honor.     And to the extent they exist\n15 we'll produce those.\n16                 THE COURT:    Yeah, I get it.   You can't\n17 create or something that doesn't exist, you don't have\n18 that, but you will set it out in there.       I'm sure you'll\n19 answer with, if they don't exist but they used to how a\n20 document retention program affected your ability to\n21 produce, right?\n22                 MR. BULLION:    Yes, Your Honor.\n23                 THE COURT:    All right.\n24                 MR. SHAPIRO:    When, Your Honor?\n25                 MR. GUERRA:    When.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0134\n\f                                                              27\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 THE COURT:    When can you get that?   What's\n2 a reasonable period of time on that, Mr. Bullion?\n3                 MR. BULLION:    Once we get the written\n4 order, I think we can get those within two weeks.\n5                 THE COURT:    All right.   We'll put 14 days\n6 from the signing of the order.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    Your Honor, that motion had a\n8 second issue which is the financial information.\n9                 Did you get that, Tom?\n10                MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n11                MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, in their\n12 response we're shocked that they would even challenge\n13 this because they cited that statute.\n14                MR. GUERRA:    Tell the Judge what you are\n15 looking for specifically.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:    Oh, that the witness -- the\n17 financial information of the net worth of Michelin.\n18                THE COURT:    Yeah.\n19                MR. SHAPIRO:    And they quoted the statute\n20 and it took effect on September 1st 2015, expressly,\n21 expressly wrote that this act takes effect on\n22 September 1st 2015.\n23                MR. GUERRA:    That for.\n24                MR. SHAPIRO:    So in fact it says Section\n25 3.   The change in law made by this action apply only to\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0135\n\f                                                              28\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 an action filed on or after the effective date of this\n2 act.    And, Your Honor, all of the case law we provided\n3 certainly provides and mandates for the production of\n4 this witness.\n5                  THE COURT:   What about that?\n6                  MR. BULLION:   The statute does say on it's\n7 face that it's effective to lawsuits filed after whatever\n8 date.     There is -- the Supreme Court has indicated in our\n9 brief is considering whether that should be applied\n10 retroactively and that's been briefed and it's before the\n11 Court at this point.   And I think frankly the reason that\n12 and I don't pretend to understand why the Court has done\n13 a lot of things it's done.     But I think the reason is\n14 there has been a lot of confusion as to what should be\n15 discovered and there has been a lot of abuse from this.\n16                 To the extent all you have to do is plead\n17 punitive damages and then you get to go out and do\n18 discovery as to financial information particularly with a\n19 company like this that is not publicly traded, Michelin\n20 North America Incorporated is not a publicly traded\n21 company and it's financial information is very sensitive\n22 to it.    The entire industry is very competitive and just\n23 mere allegation of punitive damages -- we don't think\n24 this is a punitive damage case and not even close.    And\n25 just to be able to allege punitives and then be able to\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0136\n\f                                                                   29\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 get a bunch of financial information from a privately\n2 held company we don't think it's fair and we think that's\n3 what the Supreme Court is likely going to find in\n4 response to this.\n5                   And from a timing standpoint they don't\n6 need early in the discovery of this case to develop net\n7 worth information on Michelin North America.          If the\n8 Supreme Court doesn't apply this statute retroactively\n9 and if the court decides that they're entitled to net\n10 worth information that is something they wouldn't need\n11 until basically until the time of trial because the, you\n12 know, there's a bifurcation statute as to punitive\n13 damages.   And the only time that net worth information\n14 would be admitted would be in the second phase of the\n15 trial.\n16                  THE COURT:    Okay.\n17                  MR. BULLION:    So I ask given that the\n18 Supreme Court.\n19                  THE COURT:    Hold on.   Hold on.   Hold on.\n20                  MR. BULLION:    Yes, sir.\n21                  THE COURT:    What about that?\n22                  MR. GUERRA:    We have experts.\n23                  MR. SHAPIRO:    Yes, Your Honor we have\n24 experts about that.\n25                  THE COURT:    Well, yeah I understand.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                                 MR 0137\n\f                                                              30\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 That's an issue of you don't want to get short-haired on\n2 the expert and say the Court say, Oh, the expert deadline\n3 is cut off and all that.      That's not going to go down\n4 that way.\n5                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Your Honor, it's important\n6 to know that first off this is a punitive damage case.\n7                  THE COURT:   Well, how I do know that?\n8                  MR. SHAPIRO:   Hold on a second.   The\n9 reality is when we're talking about early discovery,\n10 we're talking about just over a month.     It's just over a\n11 fact discovery.   Your Honor, that's really no time to\n12 waste.    That is the law and the law is on our side.    They\n13 have not -- but that's great the Supreme Court is\n14 considering this, but they haven't.    And in fact right\n15 now the statute I don't think it could be more clear\n16 honestly.    The change of law made by statute applies\n17 only --\n18                 THE COURT:   All right.   Until the Supreme\n19 Court tells me something different I'm going to go by the\n20 statute, Mr. Bullion.\n21                 MR. BULLION:   So are you -- is your order\n22 then, Your Honor, that we put up a witness to discuss\n23 this or that we respond to an interrogatory or what?       I\n24 think the lawyers are supposed to use the least obtrusive\n25 means to do the discovery.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0138\n\f                                                             31\n                      Various Motions' Hearing\n                          November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Your Honor, we asked for the\n2 deposition.\n3                 THE COURT:    I'm going to let him take the\n4 deposition, but I do buy your confidentiality issue.       So\n5 we've got to have a way --\n6                 MR. BULLION:    Your Honor, for the record I\n7 might ask you to stay that order in the event that we\n8 decide to take that up to the Court of Appeals.       Are you\n9 going to put a deadline on the deposition or how do you\n10 want to do that?\n11                THE COURT:    Yeah, when do y'all want the\n12 deposition?\n13                MR. GUERRA:    As soon as possible.\n14                THE COURT:    How do you want me to do it,\n15 Mr. Bullion?   And I will stay if y'all chose to seek\n16 review because I think this is an important issue for\n17 your client.\n18                MR. BULLION:    Typically the way I've seen\n19 requests for depositions handled is they would send their\n20 notice of the deposition and we would file a response\n21 with objections to it.\n22                THE COURT:    Okay.\n23                MR. BULLION:    But I would ask you to stay\n24 you know I understand what the Court's ruling is but I\n25 would ask you to stay it pending a filing of the petition\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0139\n\f                                                             32\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 for writ of mandamus to the Dallas Court of Appeals.\n2                 THE COURT:   I will when that's filed.     So\n3 here is what we're going to do.    I'm going to order that\n4 this be taken no less than 30 days.    That way you got a\n5 certain time period that you have to deal with.    And then\n6 if you chose to seek the writ of mandamus, I will stay\n7 the discovery on the net worth while you do that.\n8                 MR. BULLION:   Okay.   Would it be okay,\n9 Your Honor, for you to order that they notice the\n10 depositions so that we'll have an opportunity to file a\n11 response with objections to it before we have to take it\n12 up if we do?\n13                THE COURT:   Yeah, I think that's the way\n14 procedurally that it ought to be done and for a record to\n15 be clear that there was a deposition notice and request.\n16 I'm ordering that they serve y'all with that and I'm also\n17 ordering that it be done, and no less than 30 days from\n18 the service of that notice for the deposition of the\n19 person with knowledge of relevant facts regarding the net\n20 worth.   And then if you file -- if you serve notice and\n21 file a writ from mandamus on that issue, I will stay the\n22 deposition until the Court of Appeals has addressed that\n23 issue.\n24                MR. BULLION:   Thank you, Your Honor.\n25                THE COURT:   All right.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0140\n\f                                                                33\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    The next one up, Your Honor,\n2 is the motion regarding indecipherable design documents\n3 which is these documents.     We can't read them without the\n4 code keys for the codes and the acronyms and that's the\n5 issue.\n6                 Did you hear that, Tom?\n7                 MR. BULLION:    Yes.\n8                 THE COURT:    What about that, Mr. Bullion?\n9                 MR. BULLION:    There is no code key.   It's\n10 set out in our response, Your Honor.     I have been doing\n11 this for a really long time and I have never seen a\n12 motion like this ever.   What happens is when we produce\n13 documents that have acronyms and Michelin uses a lot of\n14 acronyms and some of them are based on French words\n15 because the parent company is a French company.\n16                Well happens is they take the documents to\n17 the deposition or the design witness and they say, What\n18 does FE mean, what does GI mean and he says sidewalk,\n19 tread.   I mean there is not a document to produce it and\n20 it would be improper in the Texas rules just to create\n21 some kind of a code key.\n22                THE COURT:    Hold on.   Hold on.   No, I'm\n23 not going to compel you to do that.\n24                How do you think I'm going to handle this\n25 now.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0141\n\f                                                                34\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:     Your Honor, I will say\n2 that --\n3                 THE COURT:    No.    How do you think I'm\n4 going to handle this now?\n5                 MR. GUERRA:    Take the deposition.\n6                 MR. SHAPIRO:     Take the deposition.\n7                 THE COURT:    See.    You will take the\n8 person -- the deposition of the person with Michelin that\n9 has knowledge of these acronyms and these keys.       It has\n10 gotta be a person with Michelin that does that or knows\n11 that, right Mr. Bullion?\n12                MR. BULLION:     I don't know that there\n13 would be one person, Your Honor.      I mean some of these\n14 documents are design documents and some of the documents\n15 are manufacturing documents and the way that it would be\n16 typically happening is on a manufacturing document.        They\n17 would ask the manufacturing witness that they're deposing\n18 this witness any way about the quality control processes\n19 and the manufacturing processes and they would ask them\n20 what does this acronym mean --\n21                THE COURT:    No.    Mr. Bullion.\n22 Mr. Bullion.   Mr. Bullion --\n23                MR. BULLION:     -- if they want to know want\n24 to know acronyms they would ask that witness.      I don't\n25 know that there's a -- I don't know --\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0142\n\f                                                               35\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion.\n2                   MR. BULLION:   -- I don't know that there\n3 is any one person that you could go in and give every\n4 single definition of every abbreviation that's used on\n5 the --\n6                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion.\n7                   MR. BULLION:   -- on all these productions\n8 documents.   We produced thousands of pages -- yes, sir.\n9                   THE COURT:   Mr. Bullion, I guess you can't\n10 hear when you are talking.\n11                  MR. BULLION:   I think it's -- I'm on the\n12 speaker phone.    It somehow mutes the other side.   If I\n13 talked on top of you again, I apologize.\n14                  THE COURT:   Okay.   Here's going to be the\n15 deal.   Michelin is a corporation or a legal entity.    It's\n16 bound to have somebody that knows these acronyms and\n17 keys.   It may not anybody that knows them all.    It may be\n18 several people with Michelin's knowledge, but I found it\n19 hard to believe that Michelin somehow don't know what\n20 everything in these documents means whether it's an\n21 acronym, an abbreviation or code or whatever.     So you're\n22 going to produce the person or persons who have knowledge\n23 of what these codes and acronyms mean in the documents\n24 that you've produced or you will -- and you will identify\n25 those acronyms so forth that nobody in Michelin knows\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0143\n\f                                                              36\n                      Various Motions' Hearing\n                          November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 what it means.    You understand?\n2                  MR. BULLION:   Yes, sir.   Can I ask for\n3 clarification?\n4                  THE COURT:   Yeah.\n5                  MR. BULLION:   And I alluded to this\n6 earlier, but they sent us a number of letters with topics\n7 for depositions.     And I understand the Court may not --\n8 may not agree with me that it makes sense for them to be\n9 able to only depose this witness once.      But what I would\n10 like to do is I don't want to have to go to Greenville\n11 for a deposition on abbreviations and then go back to\n12 Greenville for a deposition on the design of a tire.\n13 What I would ask is if they will include that in whatever\n14 notice of the deposition of the company that they served\n15 in, then we might designate the design witnesses to talk\n16 about the design of the tire and talk about it's field\n17 performance and to talk about the abbreviations on the\n18 specs.   And we might designate the manufacturing witness\n19 to talk about the manufacturing processes and procedures\n20 and the abbreviations on the manufacturing documents.\n21                 So I'd just want to do it as efficiently\n22 as we possibly can.    And once they notice these\n23 depositions, I think maybe some of this will kind of come\n24 out in the wash.\n25                 THE COURT:   My order is that you're going\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0144\n\f                                                              37\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 to produce somebody from Michelin the person or persons\n2 who have knowledge of these acronyms, abbreviations,\n3 codes for deposition.\n4                 MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n5                 THE COURT:    If it ends up being a person\n6 who has knowledge of these four or five different subject\n7 matters, well, we will have to deal with that when the\n8 time comes, but it's not going to change the fact that\n9 I'm ordering at this time that you produce the person or\n10 people who have knowledge of the information of the\n11 abbreviation, the codes, the acronyms and the documents\n12 that you have produced to opposing counsel so that they\n13 can ask Michelin's understanding of those -- of that\n14 information in the record.\n15                MR. BULLION:    I get it, Your Honor.   Just\n16 for clarification purposes, if it turns out that we would\n17 have the design witness talk about some of the\n18 abbreviations and addition to the design of the tire are\n19 you saying that it's okay with you that that's two\n20 different depositions still on two different days.\n21                THE COURT:    Well, yeah, it may have to be.\n22                MR. SHAPIRO:    And Your Honor --\n23                THE COURT:    If y'all can work it out to\n24 where you it's not, I'm not saying it can't be.    I'm just\n25 saying that it does not have to be because simple\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0145\n\f                                                               38\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 steps --\n2                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Right.   Simple steps we're\n3 having --\n4                 THE COURT:    Really bad idea.   You don't\n5 have an idea how bad an idea that is.      Simple steps.     So,\n6 you know, we'll figure out what these codes are and\n7 whatever and then we'll see where we go on the next area\n8 of discovery.\n9                 MR.

There is one more, Your\n14 Honor, after Mr. Bullion's motion concerning motion to\n15 designate the records as responsible third parties.\n16                Did you hear that, Tom?\n17                MR.

It will be\n3 reversible error in the case if they're not -- I think\n4 very clearly based on talking to my appellate people.       If\n5 they're not designated as responsible third parties, it\n6 Will be reversible error in the case.\n7                  THE COURT:    Response.\n8                  MR. GUERRA:    Yes, Your Honor.   The\n9 arguments -- the additional arguments that they place the\n10 problem is that these facts have nothing to do with the\n11 Ricos, Your Honor.   The Ricos were using an old tire,\n12 okay, but that comes from a bulletin from Michelin.     The\n13 technical bulletin came from February 9, 2006.     We\n14 deposed Michelin employees in the past about this\n15 specific bulletin that allegedly performs that the tires\n16 that are within 10 years --\n17                 THE COURT:    Okay.   But what does it have\n18 to do with somebody being named responsible third\n19 parties?\n20                 MR. GUERRA:    Because they have nothing to\n21 do with that.   The Ricos had nothing to do with that.\n22 It's alleged facts that the Ricos had anything to do with\n23 it.\n24                 THE COURT:    Well, he says that they used a\n25 tire that they knew or should have known was not safe.\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0147\n\f                                                              40\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. GUERRA:    That's not what they said,\n2 Your Honor.   They say that they used a 10-year-old tire\n3 which they depose the Ricos and the Ricos told them who\n4 inspected the tire it looked good --\n5                 THE COURT:    I know but it's not a mini\n6 trial under Texas rules.\n7                 MR. GUERRA:    I understand.\n8                 THE COURT:    They may not get submitted in\n9 the body of the trial but so I'm going to grant your\n10 motion, Mr. Bullion, for the responsible third party.\n11                MR. BULLION:    Okay.   Thank you, Your\n12 Honor.\n13                THE COURT:    Anything else?   Y'all want to\n14 take's y'all's break and discuss --\n15                MR. BULLION:    The only thing I want to\n16 make sure I'm clear on, Your Honor, has to do with the\n17 on -- I think I might have gotten us offtrack a little\n18 bit on the aspect specifications, but they want a\n19 deposition of a Michelin employee to talk about\n20 discovery.\n21                THE COURT:    That's not.\n22                MR. BULLION:    I don't know what the --\n23 real clear what the Court's ruling is on that.\n24                THE COURT:    That's not what they requested\n25 at least my understanding.    That's not the way I treated\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                            MR 0148\n\f                                                             41\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 it.   I've given you the ruling that I've made in that\n2 regard.    I even asked you if understood it and you said\n3 you did.    I understand what your argument is and you want\n4 it on the record.     It is on the record.    Ms. Dobbins is\n5 just taking it away feverishly.     I am not going to snake\n6 you without a record.    It is on the record that you feel\n7 like this is a deposition to try to get somebody's mental\n8 processes on discovery answers, right?\n9                 MR. BULLION:   Yes, Your Honor.\n10                THE COURT:   All right.\n11                MR. BULLION:   When they notice the\n12 deposition if they do then we will have an opportunity to\n13 file objections to it and come back before the Court.      I\n14 think I understand the Court's ruling.      I didn't mean to\n15 beat a dead horse.    I just wanted to make sure it was\n16 clear.\n17                THE COURT:   I'm not planning on you being\n18 back here for an objection.    I've ordered this deposition\n19 and you've made your objection based on you feel like\n20 it's, you know, them trying to take discovery of people\n21 who made basically a legal decisions on how to answer\n22 discovery.   Okay.   You've made that or I've overruled\n23 that objection.   I do not believe -- and especially based\n24 upon the way I've attempted and the way I have ordered\n25 it -- that it does that.\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0149\n\f                                                               42\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 So you've made an objection that it's\n2 improper discovery on discovery analysis and decision\n3 making.   I've overruled your objection.     It's on the\n4 record.   And I've ordered the deposition be taken with,\n5 you know, so within.\n6                 MR. BULLION:    In light of that, Your\n7 Honor, I would ask you to stay that one as well and same\n8 procedure I would like for them to notice the deposition\n9 they want give us a chance to respond it and then I would\n10 ask you to stay that ruling pending a petition for writ\n11 of mandamus.\n12                THE COURT:    No, I'm not staying that one.\n13 Not staying that one.\n14                MR. BULLION:    Okay.\n15                THE COURT:    All right.   Y'all take y'all's\n16 break and come about on the issue on the scheduling I\n17 guess that y'all were talking about.\n18                MR.

This is on a motion to\n2 quash depositions, right?\n3                 MR. GUERRA:    Yes.\n4                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Yes, Your Honor.\n5                 THE COURT:    All right.\n6                 MR. SHAPIRO:   Tom, I'm going to reiterate\n7 what we talked about.   Concerning the four depositions\n8 that Michelin noticed and we quashed Mr. Bullion and I\n9 discussed it and I will talk to Wendy Emmons,\n10 Mr. Blackerby's paralegal to coordinate dates to pair\n11 down the witnesses to a day or a day and a half, the ones\n12 in Dallas and then obviously the gentleman is in a\n13 different state, the trooper, and we will take that\n14 deposition.   We'll coordinate and work those dates out.\n15                MR. BULLION:   That sounds right.\n16                MR. SHAPIRO:   Okay.   Concerning\n17 Mr. Wischhusen, Plaintiffs noticed that deposition.       That\n18 date is unavailable for Mr. Bullion.      Mr. Bullion's\n19 position is that -- I will let Mr. Bullion explain.\n20                MR. BULLION:   Your Honor, backing up just\n21 slightly.   Plaintiffs sent us letters asking for\n22 witnesses on 20 some odd topics and I've offered one\n23 witness in Dothan, Alabama, and I've offered three in\n24 Greenville.   And then after that they asked for\n25 depositions of six different Michelin employees by name\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0151\n\f                                                              44\n                   Various Motions' Hearing\n                       November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 and they happen to be the same people other than one.\n2 And what I've told them is I will put Michael Wischhusen\n3 up who is the subject of this motion to quash to address\n4 a couple of the topics in their letters which ultimately\n5 will get turned into deposition notices.     But I don't\n6 think it's fair for them to be able to notice him as an\n7 individual and as a representative of the company and he\n8 get to depose him for technically 12 hours.\n9                 So what I've said is when we get these\n10 deposition scheduled in Greenville, I will put\n11 Mr. Wischhusen up.   They apparently want to do it on a\n12 different trip, but I'm not agreeable to that just from a\n13 cost perspective; just make a special trip out there to\n14 depose Michael Wischhusen when they can depose him as a\n15 corporate rep on these topics maybe in a couple of hours.\n16 So that's my position on that.   I think it's something we\n17 ought to be able to work out.    And I certainly -- and\n18 again, I don't think these depositions can take place\n19 until we have an order from the court on that motion to\n20 compel so that we have the all of the documents out\n21 there.\n22                MR. GUERRA:   Your Honor, here is the issue\n23 Mr. Wischhusen -- first of all, we sent the letters about\n24 the topics separate and apart from this and Mr. Bullion\n25 refused to tell us or identify witnesses.    So he never\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                         MR 0152\n\f                                                               45\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 told us who the witnesses were.      He just said notice them\n2 and I will give you people and certain names, but he\n3 didn't give us names or the identity, never gave us.         We\n4 had the hearing October.\n5                   MR. SHAPIRO:   October 5.\n6                   MR. GUERRA:    And he left.   We found him at\n7 the airport and we ended up talking to him.        But\n8 meanwhile we had to send a letter out saying in addition\n9 to those guys we want to depose these specific people and\n10 Wischhusen was one of them.      If we wants to offer him in\n11 addition to cover some of the areas that's fine.        But I\n12 am going to ask him every question that I want about any\n13 topic that is relevant to this matter and that he knows\n14 about.   And that's what Mr. Bullion is trying to do.       Oh,\n15 no, he's only going to be offered on these two topics and\n16 nothing else.    No.   No.\n17                  Also he is telling us when we're going to\n18 conduct the depositions.     That's not the way it works.\n19 We tried to accommodate folk, we do.     We waited for two\n20 long hours for Mr. Blackerby in Dallas on the depositions\n21 on the records.    He was late.    We said no big deal buddy.\n22 You ordered the deposition on Mr. Vaneaton Price for a\n23 specific date.    After that hearing there was --\n24 (unintelligible) -- Mr. Bullion wrote a little ML that\n25 said, Hey, it's not good for me that day I have a\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0153\n\f                                                                46\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 commitment and we said anything for opposing counsel and\n2 we moved it two days back.       How long did that deposition\n3 take, two hours.     That was it.\n4                   We got to the point.   We asked the\n5 questions we are done.     We don't want to be told by\n6 Michelin how to conduct the discovery for our burden of\n7 proof.\n8                   Mr. Wischhusen is a very well known man\n9 with a lot of knowledge on that company.       He knows a lot\n10 about the company and a lot about the documents at issue\n11 here not just two topics.      That's our problem with the\n12 issue, Your Honor.\n13                  THE COURT:    All right.   Mr. Bullion, tell\n14 me about that.\n15                  MR. BULLION:    I had a little bit of a hard\n16 time understanding some of that, Your Honor.\n17                  MR. GUERRA:    I'm sorry for my accent.\n18                  MR. BULLION:    But the thing is they have\n19 deposed Wischhusen before.      Mr. Guerra deposed him in\n20 that case -- and he's referring to Velo case out in\n21 Arizona.   I'm probably mispronouncing it so I apologize.\n22 He has deposed him before and he asked for him by name\n23 and I figure the Court is going probably going to let\n24 them depose Mr. Wischhusen.\n25                  All I'm asking is we're going have to\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                              MR 0154\n\f                                                                47\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 spend a week in for Greenville these depositions.\n2 There's three other witnesses.       And I don't want to make\n3 a special trip out there for Michael Wischhusen if we can\n4 help it.    I would like to make as few trips out there as\n5 I can.\n6                   Just from a personal perspective, I've got\n7 a bunch of little kids and that are playing baseball.\n8 I've got all kind of stuff going on and I would like not\n9 to have to go out there one deposition at a time.      I\n10 would like to do it efficiently and at the least cost to\n11 my client and the Plaintiffs.\n12                  MR. GUERRA:    Like Mr. Bullion we have a\n13 small practice and it's just difficult for us to take a\n14 full week off.    So we'll, accommodate counsel but it's\n15 not going to be all in one trip.      It's not going to be\n16 all in the same time.   That's just not the way we work\n17 and I'm sorry about that.\n18                  THE COURT:    I'm not going to make you do\n19 that.   Y'all both have reasons why and you would\n20 certainly want to be efficient.      I don't see an inherent\n21 inefficiency if the person he's named Wischhusen or\n22 however you pronounce it.      They've named him as a person\n23 who has relevant knowledge of facts for this issue.       If\n24 Mr. Bullion Michelin wants to designate him also as a\n25 person with knowledge of relevant facts for the\n\n\n                     VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                             MR 0155\n\f                                                              48\n                     Various Motions' Hearing\n                         November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 corporation, you certainly can do that and I'm going to\n2 say that Plaintiffs need to cover those areas too at the\n3 time.     If they want to take Mr. Wischhusen -- if you have\n4 give him notice that he is going to serve as a person\n5 with knowledge of relevant facts for Michelin on certain\n6 issues if you identify that then they need to cover that.\n7 And if they don't cover it then they didn't cover the\n8 person for Michelin that Michelin tendered regarding\n9 those areas that you designate Mr. Wischhusen's or\n10 whatever as the person who had knowledge of relevant\n11 facts.\n12                 MR. BULLION:   That's fair, Your Honor.    I\n13 told them the topics in their letters that he would\n14 address and that's fair.\n15                 THE COURT:   You get what I'm saying there?\n16                 MR. BULLION:   Yes, sir.\n17                 THE COURT:   Plaintiffs need to cover that\n18 with him.    I understand can you call anybody you want to\n19 as a named person.    But if Michelin and Mr. Bullion in\n20 trying to be efficient I think it's a good idea says,\n21 Hey, by the way we're also going to be identifying him as\n22 a corporate spokesperson a person with knowledge of\n23 relevant facts of the corporation on these areas.   You\n24 need to cover those areas too or when you get there\n25 you've passed that by.\n\n\n                    VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                          MR 0156\n\f                                                               49\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1                 MR. SHAPIRO:    Yes, Your Honor.\n2                 THE COURT:    Y'all understand.\n3                 MR. BULLION:    I doubt it's going to be\n4 know issue, but, you know, they're entitled to six hours\n5 on whatever corporate rep we put up under the rules.       If\n6 we then put up 10 of them they get 60 hours.       But it sure\n7 seems like a lot to me.    I don't think they will take 12\n8 but --\n9                 THE COURT:    We won't be doing that.   But I\n10 don't know that we're going to get there until we do, but\n11 I get your point.   I appreciate the heads up.     Plaintiffs\n12 need to be observant of the fact that, you know, as you\n13 take these depositions of people of kind of dual capacity\n14 components, we're not going to have, you know, crazy\n15 number of hours racked up because of dual capacity.\n16 That's -- it's not likely to go that way.\n17                MR. BULLION:    Okay, Your Honor.   I just\n18 wanted to make that clear.\n19                THE COURT:    I appreciate the heads up on\n20 it because I see what you're saying.\n21                MR. BULLION:    I never had thought those\n22 rules were very fair frankly.    If you come up with\n23 infinite topics you can take infinite hours of\n24 depositions.   I have looked at it a number of times and I\n25 have not been able to figure out any argument to limit it\n\n\n                   VIELICA DOBBINS, CSR, RPR\n                                                           MR 0157\n\f                                                                50\n                    Various Motions' Hearing\n                        November 3, 2015\n\n\n1 so.\n2                 THE COURT:    You know it would be hard to\n3 argue that was the intent or purpose of the rules because\n4 the intent or purpose was to limit it and make it less\n5 costly.    So I get your point and I will be cognizant of\n6 that.\n7                 MR. BULLION:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n8                 THE COURT:    I caution both sides to keep\n9 that in mind.    Anything else?\n10                MR. GUERRA:    I have one small issue that I\n11 would like to ask Tom on the record.      We have had some\n12 documents produced that are not on its original format,\n13 specifically the document that I produced that are in\n14 black and white that in the original format that are in\n15 color and the color makes the difference because there\n16 are different colors in the document and those colors\n17 mean something concerning the color.\n18                THE COURT:    Well, produce the original\n19 format.\n20                MR. BULLION:    If we have color copies,\n21 we'll certainly produce them to you.\n22                THE COURT:    All right.   The Court is\n23 ordering it be produced in the original format.

Court.\n\n       4.02    Venue is proper in Dallas County, Texas, pursuant to section 15.002(a) of the\n\nTexas Civil Practice and Remedies Code because Dallas County is the residence of Defendant\n\nJose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars and a portion of the events and omissions giving rise to the claim\n\noccurred in Dallas County.\n\n       4.03    Pursuant to § 13.005 of the Texas Civil

Adrian Rico,\n\nAdriana Rico, Maria Rico and Laura Rico, along with Plaintiffs Samuel Medina, Obdulia\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0162\n\fMedina and Natalye Medina, were traveling in a 2000 Ford Expedition southbound on Interstate\n55 near Exit 60 in Illinois.\n\n        5.02    Adrian Rico was the driver and owner of the Ford Expedition, and the remaining\nPlaintiffs were passengers and occupants.\n\n        5.03    At this time and place, Mr. Rico's operation of the 2000 Ford Expedition was\ncareful, lawful and prudent.\n\n        5.04    Suddenly and without warning and a result of Defendants' negligently, grossly\n\nnegligently and carelessly designed, tested, processed, assembled, fabricated, manufactured,\n\nlabeled, engineered, inspected, distributed, sold and warranted tire, the left rear tire on the Ford\n\nExpedition experienced a catastrophic failure directly and proximately causing the subject\n\nvehicle to, crash, flip, roll and/or ovetiurn on Interstate 55.\n\n        5.05    Each of the Plaintiffs in the vehicle at the time the subject Tire (the \"Tire\") failed\n\nsustained serious, permanent and/or catastrophic injuries.\n\n        5.06    The Tire failed as alleged due to the defendants negligence, gross negligence,\n\nrecklessness and/or carelessness in designing, testing, processing, assembling, fabricating,\n\nmanufacturing, labeling, engineering, inspecting, distributing, selling and/or warranting the Tire.\n\n        5.07    The official Illinois Traffic Crash Report states in pertinent part that the Ford\n\nExpedition \"[w]as traveling south on I-55, approximately .30 miles n01ih of exit 60, when the\n\ndriver's side rear tire blew out.\" The Crash Report also states that at the time of the incident, all\n\nof the occupants of the subject vehicle were wearing their safety seatbelt restraints.\n\n        5.08    The subject Tire that failed (the \"Tire\") was a Michelin LTX MIS P255 70R16\ntire (DOT B7LBEVUX3101) manufactured, designed, assembled, fabricated, labeled, inspected\n\nand distributed by Defendant Michelin.\n\n        5.09    Upon information and belief, the Tire was sold with the 2000 Ford Expedition by\n\nDefendant Jose Bustillo, d/b/a Mundo Cars in Dallas, Texas.\n\n        5.10    At the time the Tire failed, Plaintiffs were driving and traveling carefully and\n\nprudently, with the Tire being used for its ordinmy use and intended purpose.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0163\n\f        5.11    At and before the collision date of September 3, 2012, Defendant Michelin was\n\nengaged     in the business of designing, testing, processing,            assembling,    fabricating,\n\nmanufacturing, engineering, constrncting, distributing, labeling, inspecting, warranting and\n\nselling tires to the public, including the subject defective and dangerous Tire.\n\n        5.12    Michelin was responsible for the research, development, design, manufacture,\n\nlabeling, construction, assembly, testing, labeling, marketing, inspecting, warranting and sale of\nthe Tire.\n\n        5.13    The Tire was manufactured, assembled and constrncted at Michelin's Dothan,\nAlabama tire plant during the 31st week of 2001.\n\n        5.14    Prior to the date of the permanent, catastrophic and severe ittjuries sustained by\n\nPlaintiffs and at all times material hereto, Michelin placed the defective and ultra-hazardous Tire\ninto the stream of commerce.\n\n        5 .15   At the time of the aforementioned incident, the subject defective and ultra-\n\nhazardous Tire was being used as intended and in a manner foreseeable to Michelin, and as so\n\nforeseeably used was defective, unfit, unreasonably dangerous, failed to provide adequate\n\nwarnings, notices and instructions concerning its safety, use, maintenance, inspection,\n\nreplacement, expiration and repair.\n\n        5.16    The defective and unreasonably dangerous nature of Michelin's subject Tire\n\nrendered it unsafe for the use and purpose for which it was intended, and this dangerous and\n\ndefective condition was known or should have been known by Michelin.\n\n        5.17    The two most important components of a steel-belted radial tire including the\n\nsubject Tire are the two (2) steel belts layered on top of each other underneath the tread area.\n\n        5.18    One of the primary concerns in the manufacture of steel-belted radial tires is the\n\nadhesion between the two (2) steel belts, which must stick to each other and not move.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0164\n\f        5.19    Another primary concern in the manufacture of steel-belted radial tires is the.\n\nadhesion between the steel belts and the rubber, both on top the tread and on the bottom of the\n\ncarcass.\n\n        5.20    Michelin is aware that the rnbber and steel materials in its tires do not naturally\n\nadhere to each other. Therefore, the steel belts are coated with an adhesive rubber compound\n\ncalled skim stock.\n\n        5.21    Michelin knows that the edges of the radial tire's steel belts suffer the most\n\nstrain, heat and stress during operation and are susceptible to tread separation like what\n\nhappened to the subject Tire.\n\n        5.22   Michelin admitted in an official document submitted to NHTSA in 2006 under\n\nthe heading of \"Fundamental Mechanics of Belt Separation ... \" and under the subheading\n\n\"Basic Concepts\" of belt separation that \"Belt crack initiation and propagation\" sta1ts around\n\nthe ends of the cable. p.6-7.\n\n       5.23     This undeniable fact is also concluded by NHTSA in its white paper \"What\n\nApplied Research Has Learned From Indust1y About Tire Aging\" dated May I, 2003 which at\n\nSlide 4 reads \"Failures of Tires In the Field - Industry has told NHTSA that common tire failure\n\nmodes seen in the field are: Belt Edge Cracking,\"\n\n       5.24    Defendants defectively designed, tested, fabricated, manufactured, constructed,\n\nassembled, inspected, adve1tised, labeled, maintained, sold and/or distributed the subject Tire\n\nand placed it into the stream of commerce in an umeasonably dangerous condition.\n\n       5.25    The defects and lack ofreliability in the Tire were beyond the contemplation of a\n\nreasonable and foreseeable consumer because Michelin knew or should have known that\n\nultimate users, operators or consumers are not tire manufactures, tire technicians, or tire experts\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0165\n\fand merely members of the public whom would not and could not properly inspect this product\n\nfor defects and dangerous conditions, and that detection of such defects and dangers would be\n\nbeyond the capabilities of such persons or individuals.\n\n        5.26   Michelin negligently and recklessly caused the following non-exhaustive list of\n\ndeadly and hazardous defects to exist in the subject Tire: over-age rubber stock, liner pattern\n\nmarks, excessively thin inner-line, premature oxidation on the belt skim; improper splicing and\n\nspacing of belts and improper final inspection.\n\n        5.27   Michelin also carelessly and recklessly designed the subject Tire by failing to\n\nincorporate nylon overlays and a nylon cap ply, nylon belt edge layers, nylon safety belts to\n\nreduce the hazard of tread belt separation and catastrophic tire failure, as well as failing to\n\nincorporate adequate protection against air migration through the inner liner and tire aging.\n\n        5.28   Such inadequate quality control measures and inappropriate manufacturing and\n\ndesign practices and procedures promoted, allowed and failed to prevent separation of the Tire's\n\ninternal components and contributed to the tire failure and tread belt separation of the subject\n\nTire.\n\n        5.29   Michelin also is in possession of documents, testimony and information which\n\nconfirm that its manufacturing practices have included 1) building tires after they had trapped\n\nair or steam and had been exposed to inappropriate levels of moisture within the components of\n\nthe tire, 2) not promptly using pre-cured rubber and rubber-coated tire components to prevent\n\npremature oxidation from occurring within the tires' components so as to cause liner pattern\n\nmarks, 3) misplacement of the steel belts in the assembly which increases strain at the belt\n\nedges, promoting belt edge separation, 4) insufficient use of x-rays to detect improper and\n\ndefective manufacturing practices after the tires are built, 5) stacking of rubber components on\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0166\n\fthe unclean floor where those components were subject to contamination and 6) improper\n\nsplicing of the steel belts and innerliner of the tire which increases strain at the belt edges and\n\nthe tires' susceptibility to oxidative degradation and premature failure.\n\n         5.30   Michelin, knows or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that some of\n\nthe manufacturing defects found in the subject Tire are invisible to the naked eye and can only\n\nbe detected or identified with an x-ray.\n\n         5.31   Michelin knows that the older the age of the tire, the more likely it is to suffer\n\ntire failure.\n\n         5.32   Michelin knows that its steel belted radial tires such as the subject Tire 1) have a\n\ndate limit or expiration date of ten (10) years, 2) have a finite life and 3) suffer inevitable aging\n\nprocesses. Meanwhile, Michelin also knows that its consumers are not very experienced with\n\ntires.\n\n         5.33   Michelin is aware of the risk to its company posed by 10 year-old tires is very\n\nsmall because there are only a very small percentage of these very old tires on the road.\n\n         5.34   Michelin privately and publicly opposes tire age legislation such as laws\n\nrequiring expiration dates on tires because it would \"create supply chain issues ... Larger\n\ncustomers may well expect a stock buy-back for tires they can't sell before the age deadline\n\nlapses.\"\n\n         5.35   Michelin's tire verification depaiiment at its Dothan, AL plant follows work\n\ninstructions titled \"General Principles\" during the inspection of its finished tires. According to\n\nMichelin's own General Principles, tires that are rejected by the tire inspectors and not up to the\n\nstandards of Michelin's vehicle manufacturer customers such as GM or Ford are downgraded\n\nand sold to the replacement market as new replacement Michelin tires. However, Michelin's\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0167\n\fconsumers and even the dealers who purchase replacement tires have no idea that the tires they\n\nare purchasing were downgraded and rejected by Michelin's automotive customers.\n\n        5.36   Michelin purports that its Dothan tire plant is ISO QS 9000 certified and\n\ncompliant but Michelin does not comply with ISO QS 9000 requirements and quality standards.\n\n        5.37   Because of Michelin's poor manufacturing practices, the Tire at issue fails to\n\nmeet standards, which Michelin itself recognized as necessary tlu·ough its own internal\n\nstandards concerning tire-building practices.\n\n        5.38   Michelin has a Bad Habits List of manufacturing issues which sets forth some of\n\nthese internal standards.\n\n        5.39   In addition, Michelin has Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents,\n\nwhich set fotih Michelin's own internal standards concerning tire building and tire\n\nmanufacturing of its tires.\n\n        5.40   Michelin's Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents have annexes,\n\nglossaries, illustrations, photographs, and attachment with additional information and caveats\n\npertaining to such standards.\n\n       5.41    Michelin's Decision Tree and Aspect Specification documents and their annexes\n\nset forth numerous standards, which tire inspectors must check when inspecting cured tires.\n\n       5.42    Michelin also has a Product Standards and Guidelines Manual for Required Tire\n\nDimensional Tolerances, work procedures, reaction limits, product tolerance limits training\n\nmaterials and videotapes and tests for the tire builders - all of which set forth internal standards\n\nwhich Michelin is required to follow in the assembly, manufacturing and making of its tires.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0168\n\f        5.43    In connection with Michelin's design, manufacturing and warranty practices,\n\nMichelin performs Failure Modes and Effects Analysis and tire endurance tests, which address\n\nfailure modes of its tires.\n\n        5.44    Michelin also maintains and analyzes warranty return adjustment data with\n\ngraphs to chatt and compare tire models against other tire models and tire plants against other\n\ntire plants.\n\n        5.45    Michelin has a tire adjustment claims procedure and replacement policy\n\nadministration guidelines to maintain its knowledge of the link between its manufacturing\n\npractices and designs and tire tread separations.\n\n        5.46    Michelin's own internal confidential data about the LTX MIS tire line returns\n\nreveal that more than 700 (just from one of its hundreds of dealers and the largest tire retailer in\n\nthe world - Discount Tire) of its defective LTX MIS tires were returned for belt edge\n\nseparations. In addition, over 1,000 tires were returned to Michelin's dealers for ride vibration\n\n- an admitted precursor to tread belt separation.\n\n        5 .47   This staggering number of many more than 1,500 defective tires demonstrates,\n\ndocuments and proves that Michelin knew - as early as 2001 (11 years before the incident) -\n\nthat its LTX MIS tire line was dangerously defective.\n\n        5 .48   Instead of investigating this epidemic of defects, discovering the cause of the\n\nexcessive number of tread separations and correcting it, Michelin did the exact opposite and\n\nconcealed and still conceals this information from the public and its consumers that its LTX line\n\nposed and poses unreasonable risks of deadly danger to its consumers.\n\n        5 .49   Therefore, Michelin has direct knowledge of the link between its improper and\n\ninadequate tire design and manufacturing practices and procedures and tire tread separations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0169\n\f        5.50    Michelin also is in possession testimony and information, which confirms that\n\nthe individuals responsible for inputting, monitoring, reviewing and analyzing the adjustment\n\ndata were careless and never bothered to look at the staggering number of returns made to\n\nDiscount Tire for tread belt edge separation.\n\n        5.51    The subject Tire was defectively designed and the risks of the chosen design of\n\nthe tire outweighed the utility of the chosen designs, because known safer alternative designs\n\nwere technologically and economically feasible and were used by Michelin in other tires made\n\nfor foreign markets while not used in the U.S. market.\n\n        5.52    Safer alternative designs for the tire at issue also include the use of a belt skim\n\nrubber compound more resistant to heat and less susceptible to degrading from ozone and other\n\nfactors, which Defendants knew through its own research would cause premature degradation of\n\nthe chemicals in its tires.\n\n        5.53    Safer alternative designs for the subject Tire also include a thicker gauged belt\n\nskim rubber and inner liner, effective use of nylon reinforcement of one or both steel belts (such\n\nreinforcement could have been implemented as a full-width cap ply, a spirally wound strip, or\n\ntwo strips of sufficient width to reinforce to belt package at the steel belt edges).\n\n        5.54    Through its access to the underlying patents and other research regarding tire\n\ndesign and manufacturing including but not limited to J.Boileau/Michelin, U.S. Patent\n\n3,717,190, February 20, 1973 and A.L.

These\n\ntires suffered from defective premature oxidation like the subject Tire that caused or contributed\n\nto their failures and were aged when they failed like the subject Tire, which caused or\n\ncontributed to their failures. Many of these tires evidenced liner pattern marks like the subject\n\nTire, indicative of poor adhesion that similarly caused or contributed to their failures. Many of\n\nthese tires contained belt irregularities such as improper splicing and spacing which existed in\n\nthe subject Tire that caused or contributed to their failures. Finally, all of the above-referenced\n\ntires, like the subject Tire, failed to include the well-known safety nylon cap plies\n\naforementioned, which are now used on the lower speed Michelin LTX M/S2.\n\n       5.59    Therefore, Michelin consciously sells a line of defectively dangerous tires that it\n\nknows have killed or maimed dozens of Americans across the Country.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0172\n\f                     6.0     CAUSES OF ACTION AGAINST MICHELIN\n                     (Strict Liability against Michelin North America, Inc.)\n\n        6.01    Plaintiffs hereby incorporate and adopt all of the allegations contained in the\n\nprevious claims for relief, counts and paragraphs, and incorporates the same by reference, the\n\nsame as though fully set length herein.\n\n        6.02    Michelin was negligent, malicious and grossly negligent in designing and\n\nmanufacturing the tire in such a mam1er that it was a defectively designed and manufactured tire\n\nthat was umeasonably dangerous, failed to meet Defendants' own recognized standards and was\n\nunfit for its ordinary uses.\n\n        6.03    Michelin was aware at all relevant times prior to the design, prior to the\n\nmanufacture, prior to the sale, and prior to the failure of the subject Tire of the magnitude of the\n\nrisk - including the risk of death or catastrophic injuries - posed by a tread belt separation.\n\n        6.04    Michelin's awareness and knowledge of the risks is proven by its own\n\nknowledge of prior property damage claims, injmy claims and death claims caused by tread\n\nseparation of Defendants' tires.\n\n        6.05    Michelin carelessly, negligently and grossly negligently failed to exercise\n\nreasonable care when issuing and disseminating instructions and warnings for its passenger car\n\nand light truck tires such as the subject Tire by failing to ensure that its end-users and\n\nconsumers such as Plaintiffs were warned about the dangers and hazards posed by aged tires.\n\nTherefore, as a result of said conduct, Michelin's tire, which caused the permanent, catastrophic\n\nand fatal injuries to Plaintiffs, was defective and unreasonably dangerous when used in a\n\nreasonably foreseeable mam1er since Michelin failed to warn or protect against a danger or\n\nhazard in the use or misuse of those instrumentalities and failed to provide proper instructions\n\nfor the use of those instrumentalities.\n\n\n                                                  13\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0173\n\f       6.06    That the negligent, grossly negligent and reckless conduct of Michelin, in\n\naddition to the hereinabove alleged, consisted of, but was not limited to:\n\n       a.

(“MNA”), one of the defendants in the\n\nabove-styled and numbered cause, and files this its Special Exceptions, Amended Answer to\n\nPlaintiffs’ Original Petition, and Reliance Upon Jury Demand, and shows the Court as follows:\n\nA.     Special Exceptions\n\n       1.     MNA specially excepts to Paragraph 6.0 in Plaintiffs’ Original Petition and\n\nrespectfully asks that plaintiffs be required to replead to specify the managing agent at MNA\n\nwho committed the alleged malice or gross negligence and specifically what acts he or she\n\ncommitted.\n\n       2.     MNA also specially excepts to Paragraph 8 in Plaintiffs’ Original Petition where\n\nplaintiffs seek damages in unspecified amounts. Pursuant to Rule 47 of the Texas Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure, plaintiffs should be required to replead to specify the range of damages sought and\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0194\n\fshould not be allowed to conduct discovery until this failure is corrected. Plaintiffs should\n\nadditionally be required to state the maximum amount of damages sought.\n\n          3.    MNA requests that these Special Exceptions be granted and that the offending\n\nallegations be stricken or that plaintiffs be given an appropriate but limited period of time within\n\nwhich to replead. If plaintiffs do not timely replead, MNA requests that the allegations in\n\nquestion be stricken.\n\nB.        General Denial\n\n          MNA invokes the provisions of Rule 92 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and\n\nexercises its legal right to require plaintiffs to prove all of the allegations contained in their\n\npleadings, if plaintiffs can so prove them, which is denied. Accordingly, MNA denies generally\n\nthe allegations in plaintiffs’ pleadings and demands strict proof thereof by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\n\nC.        Affirmative Defenses\n\n          1.    MNA alleges that the tire in question met or exceeded all applicable government\n\nstandards. As such, MNA is entitled to a presumption that it is not liable under a theory of strict\n\nproducts liability.\n\n          2.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ alleged damages were proximately caused by or, in\n\nthe alternative, were solely proximately caused by the acts, omissions, or fault of Adrian Rico,\n\nthe driver of the vehicle in question.   The acts and/or omissions of Adrian Rico amounting to\n\nnegligence include losing control of the vehicle in question and causing the accident in question.\n\nThe investigating officer’s crash report notes that Adrian Rico’s “failing to reduce speed to avoid\n\ncrash” was a contributory cause of the crash. In addition, Adrian Rico was driving without\n\nadequate sleep and failed to properly steer the vehicle following the failure of the tire. MNA\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          2\n                                                                                               MR 0195\n\falleges that Adrian Rico was negligent in his operation of the accident vehicle and that said\n\nnegligence was a proximate cause of the accident. In addition, Adrian Rico and Maria Rico were\n\nnegligent in their maintenance of the tire in question. Specifically, they never had the vehicle or\n\ntires inspected prior to the accident and only checked the air pressure in the tire in question once\n\nduring the time they owned the vehicle. The tire was more than 10 years old at the time of the\n\naccident, which is contrary to the service life recommendation of MNA and other tire\n\nmanufacturers. The tire failed because of a history of overdeflection, which weakened the tire,\n\nand damage suffered due to a prior impact.           Evidence of overdeflection includes rim line\n\ncompression grooves and balance weight clip marks. Evidence of prior impact includes a radial\n\nsplit, bare and broken polyester cords, broken steel cords and accelerated tread wear. MNA\n\nalleges that Adrian Rico and Maria Rico were negligent in their maintenance of the tire and that\n\nsaid negligence was a proximate cause of the accident. MNA alleges that Adrian Rico and Maria\n\nRico are responsible third parties as those terms are defined and used in sections 33.003, 33.004\n\nand 33.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n          3.   MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for damages may be barred in whole or in\n\npart, whether under the doctrine of comparative responsibility or failure to mitigate damages, by\n\nthe failure of plaintiffs to utilize available and functional safety restraint devices as required by\n\nIllinois law. The same constitutes negligence per se and MNA requests that the jury be so\n\ninstructed.\n\n          4.   MNA alleges in the alternative that plaintiffs’ alleged damages were proximately\n\ncaused by, or, in the alternative, were solely proximately caused by, the acts, omissions, or fault\n\nof third parties for whose conduct MNA is not in any way liable or responsible.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          3\n                                                                                                MR 0196\n\f          5.    MNA specifically pleads the provisions of Chapters 32 and 33 of the Texas Civil\n\nPractices and Remedies Code dealing with contribution and comparative responsibility and\n\nrequests that any damages be assessed in accordance with those provisions. Plaintiffs have sued\n\nJose Bustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars and alleged that his negligence was a proximate cause of the\n\naccident. MNA alleges he was negligent because he sold a vehicle with 5 different tires of 4\n\ndifferent sizes including the subject tire that was over 10 years old. MNA alleges that Jose\n\nBustillo d/b/a Mundo Cars is a co-defendant or, if the claims against him are subsequently\n\ndismissed, a responsible third party or settling party as those terms are defined and used in\n\nsections 33.003, 33.004 and 33.011 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n\n          6.    MNA specifically pleads Chapter 82 of the Texas Civil Practices and Remedies\n\nCode dealing with design defects and requires plaintiffs to meet their burden of proof with regard\n\nto all claims of design defect as specified in Chapter 82.            Plaintiffs must prove by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence (1) there was a “safer alternative design,” as that term is\n\nstatutorily defined, and (2) the defect was a producing cause of the personal injury, property\n\ndamage, or death for which the claimant seeks recovery.           MNA requests that the jury be\n\ninstructed on all statutorily required elements of a “design defect case.”\n\n          7.    MNA asserts that plaintiffs’ recovery of medical or health care expenses incurred\n\nbe limited to the amount actually paid or incurred by or on behalf of the plaintiffs. Tex. Civ.\n\nPrac. & Rem. Code § 41.0105.\n\n          8.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for breach of warranty are barred by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations, having been asserted more than four years after original delivery\n\nof the subject tire.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                          4\n                                                                                               MR 0197\n\f          9.    MNA alleges that plaintiffs’ claims for breach of warranty are barred on account\n\nof plaintiffs’ failure to give notice as required by Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 2.607.\n\n          10.   MNA alleges that by virtue of the 1995 amendments to the Texas Deceptive\n\nTrade Practices – Consumer Protection Act, Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.41, et seq., recovery\n\nunder the DTPA is limited to “economic damages” as defined by statute. Tex. Bus. & Com.\n\nCode § 17.45(11). “Economic damages” are statutorily limited to pecuniary loss. By statute,\n\nplaintiffs may not recover exemplary damages, damages for physical pain and mental anguish,\n\nlost of consortium, disfigurement, physical impairment, or loss of companionship and society.\n\nFurthermore, “mental anguish” damages may not be awarded unless the trier of fact finds that\n\nMNA’s conduct was committed intentionally. Tex. Bus. & Com. Code § 17.50(b)(1).\n\n          11.   With respect to plaintiffs’ allegation of punitive or exemplary damages, MNA\n\nalleges as follows:\n\n                a.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n                be sustained because an award of punitive damages in this case would contravene\n\n                and violate Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the\n\n                United States, which guarantees due process of law and equal protection of the\n\n                laws; Article 1, Section 3 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal\n\n                protection of the law; and Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which\n\n                guarantees due process. Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages are\n\n                unconstitutional in the following respects:\n\n                b.      Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA\n\n                cannot be sustained because the standard for determining liability for punitive\n\n                damages under Texas law is vague and arbitrary and does not define with\n\n\n\n4542675                                          5\n                                                                                            MR 0198\n\f          sufficient clarity the conduct or mental state which gives rise to such a claim and\n\n          therefore violates MNA’s constitutional due process rights under the Fourteenth\n\n          Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, Section 19 of the\n\n          Texas Constitution.\n\n          c.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages cannot be sustained\n\n          against MNA in this case because Texas law does not (i) provide a standard of\n\n          sufficient clarity for determining the appropriateness, or the appropriate size, of a\n\n          punitive damages award, (ii) provide limits on punitive damages imposed by the\n\n          applicable principles of deterrence and punishment, (iii) prohibit an award of\n\n          punitive damages, in whole or in part, on the basis of invidiously discriminatory\n\n          characteristics, including the corporate status of defendants, and (iv) provide for\n\n          judicial review on the basis of objective standards in violation of defendants’ due\n\n          process and equal protection rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\n          the United States Constitution and the double jeopardy clauses of the Fifth\n\n          Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and by Article 1,\n\n          Section 3 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of the law;\n\n          and Article I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees due process,\n\n          and Article 1, Section 14 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees against\n\n          double jeopardy.\n\n          d.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained in this case because any award of punitive damages under Texas law\n\n          without bifurcating the trial of all punitive damages issues and the failure of the\n\n          Court to adopt other procedural constitutional safeguards in the submission of\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                     6\n                                                                                          MR 0199\n\f          evidence relative to determining the size of any punitive damages award would\n\n          violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which\n\n          guarantees due process of law and equal protection of laws; Article I, Section 3 of\n\n          the Texas Constitution, which guarantees equal protection of the laws; and Article\n\n          I, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution, which guarantees due process of law.\n\n          e.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained in this case because imposition of a punitive damages award would\n\n          violate the due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the\n\n          Texas Constitution because the standard for the imposition of punitive damages\n\n          lacks objective guidelines, invites the jury to engage in caprice and discrimination\n\n          in the administration of the law and permits repeated and unlimited punishment\n\n          for the same alleged misconduct.\n\n          f.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n          be sustained because an award of punitive damages under the Texas law for the\n\n          purposes of compensating plaintiffs for elements of damage not otherwise\n\n          recognized by Texas law would violate MNA’s due process rights guaranteed by\n\n          the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by the due\n\n          process provisions of Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n          g.     Any award of punitive damages based on anything other than MNA’s\n\n          conduct in connection with the sale of the specific single tire that is the subject of\n\n          this lawsuit would violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\n\n          the United States Constitution and the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth\n\n          Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and the due process\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                      7\n                                                                                           MR 0200\n\f                 clause of Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution and Article I, Section 14\n\n                 of the Texas Constitution providing guaranty against double jeopardy, because\n\n                 any other judgment for punitive damages in this case cannot protect defendants\n\n                 against impermissible multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong.\n\n                 h.     Plaintiffs’ claims for punitive or exemplary damages against MNA cannot\n\n                 be sustained because any judgment for punitive damages in this case would\n\n                 constitute multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong and cannot protect\n\n                 defendants against multiple punishment for the same alleged wrong in future\n\n                 cases in violation of MNA’s rights to due process and equal protection of the laws\n\n                 under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I,\n\n                 Section 3 and 19 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n                 i.     Alternatively, in the event the Court allows the jury to consider awarding\n\n                 punitive damages despite the constitutional defects described above, MNA\n\n                 asserts that the cap on exemplary damages contained in Chapter 41 of the Texas\n\n                 Civil Practice & Remedies Code applies and limits the amount of exemplary\n\n                 damages which can be awarded.\n\nD.        Reliance Upon Jury Demand\n\n          MNA relies upon plaintiffs’ jury demand.\n\n          WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, defendant Michelin North America, Inc.\n\nprays that plaintiffs take nothing by their suit, that MNA have judgment for its costs in this\n\nproceeding, and that the Court grant MNA such other and further relief as the Court may deem\n\njust and proper.\n\n\n\n\n4542675                                           8\n                                                                                               MR 0201\n\f                                           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                           GERMER BEAMAN & BROWN, P.L.L.C.\n                                           301 Congress Avenue, Suite 1700\n                                           Austin, Texas 78701\n                                           (512) 472-0288 Telephone\n                                           (512) 472-0721 Facsimile\n\n                                           By: /s/ Thomas M.

When it stops, tragedy: Obdulia, the Medina n101n, had become a\n\nquadriplegic.\n\n       Thus, this lawsuit is a products liability and negligence case arising out of the\n\ncatastrophic failure of that defective Mcl1elin I/l'X M/S tire on Septe1nbcr 3, 2012 which caused\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0206\n\fthe quadriplegia of Plaintiff Obdulia Medina and a myriad of injuries to the other occupants.\n\nJust lil(e it has done to many otl1cr fmnilics including the Velo fan1ily, Michelin's defectively\n\ndesigned and manufactured T,cfX :MIS tire line just added another victhn to its long list and\n\nPlaintiffs can prove it with Michelin's own documents. 'fhat is why Michelin refuses to produce\n\nthe critical info1mation, documents and evidence repeatedly requested since April. All of it\n\nreasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of ad1nissible evidence in accordance with the\n\n'J'cxas Rules of C:ivil Procedure.\n\nII.     Background: 'fhis Motion simply requests the ITonorable Court to order Defendant\n\nMicl1elin to comply with the \"fexas discovery rules and produce the critical documents,\n\ninformation and evidence repeatedly asked for more than four (4) monihs since the beginning of\n\nApril 2015.     Requests for Production, r;xhibit A. At the end of April, Michelin produced next\n\nto nothing. Defendant's Responses, Exhibit B. On May 11, 2015, after the hearing, in a meetit1g\n\njust outside this courtrootn, and ihcreaftcr, defense counsel repeatedly promised that if Plaintiffs\n\njust signe(f Michelin's Protective Order, they would get the re1nainh1g documents:\n\n                Your email is co1rcct that MNA anticipates being able to make its\n                supplemental production within 10-14 days of the protective order\n                being entered,\n\nE-lvfail fron1 Nelson Mullins, counsel for NfNA, May 28, 2015, r<,Xhfbit (~.\n\n                [W}c will rr1ovc forward with the agreed protective order and \\Vith our\n                supplemental production, which we would anticipate making\n                within 10-14 days of entrr of the protective order.\n\nJi:-Mail fro1n Nelson Mulli11s, counsel for MNA, Mlty 29, 2015, Exhibit D.\n\n                We are worl{ing on the production anti still anticipate mal<lng it\n                within 10-14 days of entry of the protective order as originally\n                estimated.\n\nr~·-.MaiL fron11Velson   M11lli11s, counsel for .MlYA, June 4, 20.15, Exhibit E'.\n\n\n\n\n                                                      2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0207\n\f        Though Plaintiffs disagree witl1 Protective ()rders, in view of Michelin's repeated\n\npromises, Plaintiff.'> executed it All a sham. Michelin's production at the end o.f'June was a\n\njoke. It failed to produce about fo1iy (40) of the fifty (50) requests for production. Despite\n\ncountless e-mails, co1Tespondcnce and phone calls by Plaintiff<;' counsel concerning Michelin's\n\nproduction of docun1cnts about the design, inspection, testing, building, curing, quality control\n\nprocesses, 1nanufacture and retu111s concerning Micl1elin LTX M/S tires, it is clear that Michelin\n\nhas 1nisled Plaintiffs about its production every step of the way.\n\n        So, 011 ,July 16, 2015, Plaintiffs informed Michclh1 that their production was cxh·emcly\n\ndeficient mid that they would seek ::;anctions fi·om the Cou1i. In response Michelin did nothing.\n\n'fhcy never tried to teach J>laintiffs' counsel by phone,   e~mail   or letter. So, on August 3, 2015,\n\nPlaintiffs sent another letter. Still nothing. 'fhe next day, on August 4, 2015, Plaintiff<>' counsel\n\n£)avid Shapiro directly contacted defense counsel about the deficient disclo::;ure and was\n\ninfo1med that tl1c atto1ney in chm·gc of Michelin's discovery was no 1011ger working 011 the case.\n\nMr. Shapiro did not give up. So, he contacted other Michelin counsel. Still, Michelin offered no\n\nadditional production and Mr. Shapiro was told that the production o-f documents had to be\n\nnegotiated v.,1ith Michelin. Yet, again, Plaintiff.<>' counsel wrote to Michelin's counsel. Still, 110\n\nadditional production. Instead, Michelin played du1nb, wasted time and acted like it did not\n\nknow that their production wa::; grossly deficient. Refush1g to give up, the next day, August 5,\n\n2015, Plaintiffs' counsel Luis Guen·a called and also wrote to Michelin's counsel about its\n\ndeficient disclosure.   (;orrespondence, Exhibit F          In response, Plaintiff.\"' counsel got no\n\ndocu1nents and was told that Plaintiffs needed to negotiate the discovery with Michelin. Still,\n\njust four (4) days ago on August 17, 2015, during the depositions of the driver and his family,\n\nPJah1tiffs' counsel again discussed this issue with defe11sc counsel in Dallas, 'I'exas. In response,\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0208\n\fPlaintiffs' counsel was again told that they should know the process by now having done it in\n\nVelo and that they needed to 11egotiate the production Vvith Michelin.\n\n        ln short, after waiting nearly five (5) months and even executing Michelin's Protective\n\nOrder, Michelin responded to about ten (10) of Plaintiffs' fifty (50) Requests for Production.\n\nThousands of pages of relevant documents inte11tionally concealetl and withheld by Michelin to\n\nprevent Plaintiff.<> from exposing their shoddy practices and known defects tl1at led to this L'fX\n\nMIS failure. Therefore, this Motio11 simply requests the flonorable Court to order J)efcndanl\n\nMichelin to comply with the Texas discovery rules and prod11ce the critical docun1ents,\n\ninfo11nation and evidence repeatedly asked for 1norc than fOur (4) months since the beginning of\n\nApril 2015.\n\n111.    Michelin's 'Discovery Modus ()perandi: The subject defective Michelin tire itself and\n\nt11c docu1ncn1.s requested together with a plant inspection arc critical evidence in this case.\n\nMichelin knows the critical importance of the docu1nents and how they are interrelated to each\n\nother. Plaintiffs' counsel knows the docu1nents because a couple of years ago they had a case\n\nsimilar to t11is one na1ncd Velo. Similar to Velo, the passengers of this vehicle were severely\n\ninjured, 5Jinn?ar to Velo, a scat-belted morn bccan1e a quad1iplegic, paraly7.cd fi:om the neck\n\ndown. ,')imilar to Velo, this case involves a rollover caused by a defective Michcli11 tire corning\n\napart on the highway. c'limilar to Velo, the defective Michelin tire is a light truck tire. Sin1ilar to\n\nVelo, the defective Michelin light tn1ck tire is a I.,TX ivf/S.      /{iniilar to Velo, the defective\n\nMichelin LTX MIS was nlanufactured at Michelin's plant in Dothan, Alabama. Similar to Velo,\n\ntbc defCctive Michelin LTX M/S tire was manufactured in the year of2001. c'limilar to Velo, the\n\ndefective Michelin l,'l'X M/S tii·e had a significat1l an1ount ofuscablc and legal tread. 1bc cases\n\narc so similar that in the present case Michelin demanded to use the exact same Protective Order\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\n\n                                                                                                    MR 0209\n\fas the one used in Velo. Similar to Velo, one of Michelin's law .firms handling the discovery is\n\nNelson Mullins.       So, because of Velo PlaintiffS' counsel lmows that each of the documents\n\nrequested is critical in this case.\n\n         l.JnfOrtunately, just like the Tle/o case aJJd a myriad of other 1\\.1ichelin cases, stonewalling\n\nis Michelin's strategy ru1d discovery practice. First, Michelin makes up its own                     sclf~serving\n\n\nscope of discovery and disregards the applicable Rules of Discovery. Second, Michelin claims it\n\ndid nothing Mong, denies liability and discloses nothing. Third, 1\\.1ichelin pro1nises to produce\n\ndocun1ents after it tricks the Plaintiffs into signing a Protective Order.                  Fourth, even after\n\nexecuting a l)rotective Order, Michelin still produces next to nothing, Fifth, Michelin alleges\n\nthat procedural technicalities such as meet m1d confer 1 has not been 1net to further delay\n\nproduction. Sixth, J.>Iaintiffs are forced to file motions to compel. This is not argument. This is\n\na fact. 1''here are multiple examples of Micl1elin's illegal course of conduct in Courts across the\n\ncountry, (Plaintiffs will search and obtain the best example they can and will provide it to the\n\nCourt prior to the hearing on this motion).\n\n        This way the all mighty Michelin misdirects the lawsuit from its merits and forces the\n\ndisabled quadriplegic Plaintiff to waste their limited resources in time consuming and expensive\n\ndiscovery disputes.       As a result, the Plaintiffs gain nothing and waste precious time and\n\nresources. Just plain Mong. 'J'herefore, Plaintiffs respectfully ask this 1-Ionorable Court to deal\n\nswiftly with Michelin's illegal conduct and order it to co1nply with the Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nand produce the long overdue requested discovery immediately or face severe sanctions.\n\nIV.     Michelin's stonewalling: At the inception of this products liability lawsuit, Plaintiffs\n\nserved Michelin with discovery requests asking for products liability documentation concerning\n\n\n1\n True to form a few days ago on August 13, 2015, Michelin's counsel wrote a letter threatening that meet and\nconfer requirements were not complied with. Defense counsel corresponde11ce, August 13, 2015, Exhibit(}.\n\n\n                                                        5\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0210\n\ftheir LTX M/S tire.

Jn addition, Michelin failed to produce its belt skhn\nstock formula pe1taining to the subject tire. The rubber used between the steel belts is referred to as skim stock.\nSkim stock is what iuakcs the belts adhere to one another. 'fherefore, the design ofthe skim stock and its resfatance\nto degradation is critical evidence to understand the subject tire's resistance to tread belt separation failure like it\nhappened here.\n\n\n\n                                                                    6\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                MR 0211\n\f                                                                   ...             .\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)csign & Manufacture           'No\n\n\n                                                                   410312015           J)csign & Manufacture               No\n\n\n\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)esign & Manufacture               No\n\n\n                                                                   4/03/2015           l)csign & Manufacture               No4\n\n                                                                                                                       i\n                                                                   4/03/2015           Design & Manufacture\n\n                                                                                                                       f\n                                                                                                                       I\n                                                                                                                                 I\n                                                                                                                                 I\n                                                                                                                                 '\n                    North      America's                           4/03/2015           Design & Manufacture                No    I\n        recommendations,       dete11ninations,     or\n        guidelines as to the acceptable or\n        unacceptable rate or :fi·equeney of loss\n        adjustment (how the tire is doing in the\n        Geld)\n    16.

Prejudice to Jlfaintiffs\n\n         Michelin's actions are extremely prejudicial to Plaintiffs preventing them from\n\nconducting products liability discovery in this case.      !<~or   instance, Plaintiffs cannot conduct\n\ndiscovery or depose Michelin's witnesses and employees about 1) manufacturing and/or design\n\ndefects, 2) the ma11ufacturing and design .Process, 3) the Aspect Specifications, 4) the General\n\nPrh1ciples, 5) the 'Technical Notes, 6) Quality Control, 7) Classification of tires, 8) Repair\n\nprocedures, 9) the L1'X MIS reac,ied tolerance limits, 10) manufUctul'ing and design of the LTX\n\nMIS, 11) the wa1ranty clairns on the LTX MIS, 12) problems occu1Ting d11riI1g 1nanufilcturing,\n\n13) the tire inspection process and damage ru1alyses, etc., etc., etc. Without tl1ese docmnents,\n\nMichelin prevents: a) Plaintiffs fro1n conductir1g product;; liability discovery, b) prevent\n\nPlaintiff.~'   experts from obtaining tl1e necessary foundation, and c) further prevents Plaintiffs\n\nfrom cross-examining Michelin's expe1ts. Even worse, Michelin will attempt to be rewarded\n\nfor its absconsio11 of evidence by filing Motions :for Summary Judginent, Daubert Motions and\n\nMotions to Exclude Plaintiffs' liability cxpe1t - claiming that they did not have reliable data\n\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\n\n                                                                                                    MR 0224\n\finf(nmation or evidence supporting their opinions. Thus, Michelin's stonewalling is extremely\n\nprejudicial to l)laintiffs.\n\n        Michelin's delays are even more egregious when one considers the spastic quadriplegic\n\nObdulia. It is easy to forget and lo;;e sight of the real Plaintiffs including Obdulia whose life\n\nwas destroyed by Michelin's defective tire.         Now, they add insult to injury, preventing\n\ndiscovery and withholding relevant evidence. All this to prevent Obdulia and her family fi:om\n\nhaving their day in Court. ()bdulia has no time to waste. Iler life as a result of the defective\n\nMichelin's tire failure is unbearable. She cannot walk. She cannot 1nove. She cannot even\n\nturn herself around in bed. She cannot cut her ovvn fOod. She cannot even open her pill box\n\nwith her hm1ds to take her strict daily prescription regimen. She cannot urinate or evacuate like\n\na 11011nal human being. Her husband and children have to excavate fCces out of her rectu1n.\n\nShe cannot perform the most basic hu1nan functions. She repeatedly contracts deadly bed\n\nsores, and urinary tract infections which require fi·cquent hospitalizations - all of which a direct\n\nresult of Michelin's defective tire f3.ilure.\n\n        (~onclusion:          Michelin   intentionally withheld   and concealed       the Aspect\n\nSpecifications and all corresponding documents.           Michelin intentionally withheld and\n\nconcealed the General Principles.          Michelin intentionally withheld and concealed the\n\nTechnical Notes and related documents. Similarly, Michelin intentionally withheld and\n\nconcealed all the Reaction and Tolerance Limits documents.                ln addition, Michelin\n\n\\Vithhcld and concealed the adjustment data and thousand.11 of warranty claims as well as\n\nall the internal documents it uses to identify, adjust and evaluate the returned defective\n\ntires after they leave the plant.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0225\n\f          Conversely,     Plaintiff.~   have diligently assisted Michelin in their discovery by: 1)\n\nshipping the detCctive tire to Michelin for their forty-Jive (45) day inspection, 2) 1naking the\n\nvehicle available fOr inspection to Michelin's cxpe1is, 3) producing Plaintiff.\"! and fmnily for\n\ndepositions, and 4) assisting in the depositions of the driver and family.                        In all, nine (9)\n\ndepositions that J>laintiffs made possible and available to Michelin.                      Plaintiffs have given\n\nMichelin access to all they needed to conduct their discovery and further their defenses,\n\n          The facts speak for themselves. Michelin k11ows the importance of the documents\n\nrequested and how critical the info1mation is. So, Michelin made a conscious and intentional\n\ndecision to withhold and conceal them. ·rhls is Michelin's modus· 011erandi. J)efiant, an·ogant,\n\nand in disregard of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. When M'ichelin is sued, Michelin acts\n\nlike they have their own special rules of civil procedure m1d: 1) discloses nothing, 2) delays\n\nalways, and 3) prevents justice. Michelin's conduct directly violates the 'I'exas discovery ii.des,\n\nthe fundamental principles of litigation, and the authority of this Honorable Court. Michelin's\n\nactions co1Tupt the i11tegrily of the legal process and make a mockery of the l'exas justice\n\nsystem.\n\n          This cannot be tolerated. T11is is not how litigation is done in t11e -Lone Star State. 'fhe\n\ntortfeasor docs not control the litigation proccs;; and usurps fron1 the Great State of Texas its\n\nexclusive power to dcte1111inc the llules of Civil Procedure and its prescribed scope of\n\ndi;;covcry.     Moreover, \\Vith a fa;;t approaching expert disclosure deadline, tiinc i;; of the\n\nessence. Accordingly, pursuant to 1'ex. R.              C~iv.   P. 215.2, PlaintiffS respectfully request this\n\nflonorable c:ourt 15 to order J)efendant Michelin to iinmediatcly produce the requested\n\ninforn1ation and documc11ts and \"make such orders ... as m·e just.\"\n\n                ---~---\n\n\n15\n  1''he choice of authorized sanctions is within the sound discretion of the trial court In re F,sfate ofMarley, 390\n8.W.3d 421, 424 (Tex.

I believe our position on the protective order is very clear-that we cannot agree to your\nadded language, which would render the protective order meaningless and would expose Michelin's trade secrets to\npublic disclosure. If you will agree to remove that language, we will move forward with the agreed protective order and\nwith our supplemental production, which we would anticipate making within 10-14 days of entry of the protective\norder. !fyou will not agree to remove the language, please let me know as soon as possible so we can move the court\nfor entry of our protective order.\n\nAlso, you have not acknowledged my email to David of 5/28/15, in which I noted that for several requests, particularly\nthose seeking manufacturing/inspection related documents, Michelin has asked you to identify your defect theories and\nthe tire components/manufacturing processes at issue so that Michelin can identify and produce relevant documents.\n!n order for Michelin to locate the appropriate responsive documents and produce them within the time frame\ndiscussed above, we need you to provide this information as soon as possible.

The\n          burden is on MicheliI1 when it Vlithholds ru1d conceals its ow11 documentation and\n          evidence. Si11ce all of the docum·~nts requested are Michelin is docIDnents, Michelin\n          knows exactly which documents ii withheld and did not produce. Plaintiffs have been\n          waiting for more than lhree (3) mcnths for this docurneutation with false promises and\n          assuran.ces.\n\n                  Notably, to assure that th;:se sher1an.igans did not occur, wl1ile wa1t1ng for\n          Michelin's disclosure over t11e last 8everal ~11ontl1s·, Plaintiffs' com1sel took. the\n          initiative and· repeatedly reached out to- J'vfichelin 's defense coun.<;el and perfo1med\n          1nany rneets and. confers about the 011tstandin.g discovery, All to no avail. Michelin's\n          production at the e11d of June wa:; grossly defective and deficient-·- eve11 after these\n          r1u1nerous 1neets and confers.\n\n                  After Plaintiffs finally. rec('ived the dcficier1t Michelin prodt1ctior1, we vvrote a\n          letter documenting Michelin's totd lack of production on July 16, 2015-20 days ago.\n          Still, up to today, 011 August 4, :~Ol5i no 011e frorn Micl1elin or Michelin:s cou113el\n          contacted m about it. In fact, Michelin sat on this letter for about lhree (3) weeks and\n          did absolutely nothing. Not once did Michelin through its multiple defense counsel\n          reach <)ut to us by letter, pho11e call, perso11ally or e-1nail. Moreover, I saw you for a\n          full day last week during the depositions om clients including the quadriplegic mom\n          Obdulia Medina, and not once did you ~;tate that Michelin had proble1ns understanding\n\n\n          ' Jn the future, please direct all correspondence to us by e-mail.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                         MR 0285\n\f August 4, 2015\n Page 2\n\n\n our leiter cortce1ning its reprehensit le lack of clisclosure.\n\n       Consequently, your letter of today· is nothiI1g but a self-serving letter only sent\nafter! called you today about Michelin's lack of production. Still, Micbelin had no\nfarther production to offer. Therefore, the meet and confer already took place not only\ntoday but throughout the wait for the outstanding discovery. As such, Plaintiffs much\nmore than met and complied with the letter, spirit and intent of Rule 191.2 of Tex. R.\nCiv. Proc.\n\n        Still, in s.pite ofMic.helin's steadfast refusal to produce the doct11ne11ts and eve11\nafter receiving your letter, we attentpted ·yet arlother rneet arid con.fer just minutes ago\nwhen Luis 1.eJt you a voic.ernail. Still, in_ a final effort before we file our Motior1) we\nwould be willh1g to 1neet and confer with Michelin this afternoon at a ti1ne conve11ier11.\n\n       Micheli11's actions are even more egregious because at the sa1ne ti111e .'Michelir1\nhides and c011ceals releva11t docu1r_ents, I)laintiff.'l have made the tire available, 11ave\noffered the1nselves for depositioru (which have take11 place) and made the vel1icle\navailable for an unfettered ir1spectic11 for-Michelin's experts.\n\n         Enough is enough. Obduli1's life - as you saw last week - is a day-to-day\nstruggle to survive without any resemblance to the life she led before the tire failure.\nThere is no time to waste.

The tire in question was designed by\n\n Michelin Americas Research & Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n became a division ofMNA on January I, 2008, and manufactured by MNA during the 3 lst week\n\n of2001 at its Dothan, Alabama plant. Unless otherwise indicated, MNA's responses are limited\n\nto infonnation concerning the tire in question and tires built to the specification in place for the\n\ntire in question at the I)othan, Alabama plant during the sixth months before and six months after\n\nthe date of manufacture of the tire in question (the \"relevant scope').\n\n                                 TRADE SECRETS OBJECTION\n\n          :MNA objects to many of the discovery requests because they seek information and/or\n\ndocuments that are of a confidential, proprietary or commercially sensitive nature to MNA,\n\nexempt from discovery under notions of constitutional privacy and/or that may be covered by or\n\nbe the subject of express or implied confidentiality, secrecy or nonpublication agreements or\n\nunderstandings. To the extent necessal'y, MNA objects to the discovery requests in that they\n\nseek the discovery of trade secret information and documents, including confidential research,\n\ndevelopment and technical information. MNA states that information and documents responsive\n\nto some of the discovery requests may have been withheld because these discovery requests seek\n\nprivileged information and privileged docun1ents that constitute the trade secrets of MNA,\n\nDisclosure of these b·ade secrets would, result in substantial prejudice and harm to MNA.\n\n'fherefore, MNA contends it is essential to MNA's operations that its work and documents\n\nremain confidential.\n\n          Texas law protects the disclosure ofMNA's trade secrets. A trade secret may consist of\n\nany trade formula, pattern, device or compilation of information that is used in one's business\n\n\n4530886                                          3\n\n\n\n                                                                                               PRFP00049\n\n\n\n                                                                                                       MR 0293\n\f and gives one an opportunity to obtain an advantage over co1npetitors who do not know or use it.\n\n Computer Assoc.

Moreover, MNA makes reasonable effo11s to\n\nmaintain the secrecy of this information, the information is of substantial value to MNA, the\n\ninformation would be very valuable to MNA's competitors, and the infonnation derives its value\n\nby virtue of the effort of its creation and lack of dissemination. Accordingly :MNA believes such\n\ninformation constitutes a trade secret and should be protected. from disclosure.\n\n          Unless otherwise stated in its responses, MNA is not withholding any privileged\n\ndocuments/information within the relevant scope. However, to the extent plaintiffs do not agree\n\nwith the scope of :MNA's discovery responses, MNA reserves the right to have its objections to\n\nscope ruled upon prior to expanding the scope of its responses and its search Jar responsive\n\nand/or privileged documents/information.\n\n          Subject to the foregoing, MNA hereby answers the individual requests as follows:\n\n                         RESPQNSE TO REQUESTS EQR PRODUCTION\n\nREQUEST FOR PRO!JUCTJON N0.-1;.\n\n        Identify and produce the organizational charts showing the functions and reporting\nstructure of Michelin North America1s departments, divisions, or units, whether domestic or\nforeign, responsible, either directly or indirectly, for: research, design and development;\nmanufacturing and production; quality control of the subject tire and the 1nodel tires.\n\n\n\n          After a reasonable and diligent search, MNA has not located any docurnents responsive\n\nto this request relating to the Dothan, Alabama plant during the relevant scope.

MNA further\n\nobjects to the extent this request seeks or attempts to seek infonnation that constitutes\n\ncommercially sensitive, confidential business information ofMNA.

(\"MNA\"), competently testify as follows:\n\n      1. This affidavit is based on my personal knowledge and my review of information\n\n         available to me in my role at MNA. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n         competent to execute this Affidavit.\n\n      2. I have never been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude.\n\n      3. I am a Senior Technical Advisor employed by MNA. I was employed with Michelin\n\n         Americas Research and Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n         became a division of MNA on January 1, 2008, from January 2007 to December 2011.\n\n         Since May 1999, I have been employed by MNA. During my employment with MNA\n\n         and MARC, I have become familiar with the tires that are designed by MARC and\n\n         manufactured by MNA, as well as the design and manufacturing procedures used.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0335\n\f4. I am familiar with the process by which tire specifications are developed, with the\n\n   composition and dimensions of certain tires MNA has designed and manufactured during\n\n   my employment, with MNA manufacturing processes and equipment, and with the\n\n   efforts that MNA makes to protect its proprietary and trade secret information.\n\n5. The Subject Tire is a P255/70R16 109S Michelin LTX MIS bearing DOT number\n\n   B7LBEVUX3 l 01 and manufactured by MNA in its Dothan, Alabama plant in the 31st\n\n   week of 2001.\n\n6. A tire is built to a single green tire and a single cured tire specification. The Subject Tire\n\n   was manufactured pursuant to a particular specification in place for P255/70R16 109S\n\n   LTX MIS tires manufactured at MN A's Dothan, AL plant during the 31st week of 2001.\n\n7. The \"P\" designation means \"passenger.\" The \"255\" is this tire's nominal section width in\n\n   millimeters. The \"70\" is the tire's aspect ratio - the sidewall height is 70% of the tire's\n\n   width. The \"16\" is the tire's inner diameter in inches, which means that the tire fits on a\n\n    16\" wheel. The tire's service description, \"109S,\" includes the load index (109), which\n\n   means that the tire is designed to support loads of 2271 pounds at 35 psi inflation\n\n   pressure, and the speed rating (S), which indicates that the tire is ceiiified to carry a load,\n\n   under specified conditions, at a maximum speed of 112 mph.\n\n8. \"Common green\" tires are tires that share the same specifications except for exterior\n\n   moldings. The model of the Subject Tire has three common green tires that also were\n\n   manufactured at the Dothan, AL plant. With the exception of these common green tires,\n\n   there are no other tires that were made to the same green tire specifications as the Subject\n\n   Tire.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0336\n\f9. Throughout my employment with MARC and MNA, MNA has manufactured steel belted\n\n   radial tires for a wide variety of passenger vehicles, light trucks, medium trucks, heavy\n\n   trucks, and special purposes such as high performance tires, and aircraft tires. During\n\n   2001, the year the Subject Tire was manufactured, MNA manufactured approximately\n\n   1500 different tire designs at its various plants in No11h America. The design of these\n\n   tires often varies significantly depending on the particular service applications such as\n\n   highway, mud and snow, all-season, off-road, and high performance.\n\nI 0. A tire is a highly engineered, scientifically developed, complex laminate structure. It\n\n   incorporates elements of the disciplines of polymer chemistry and mechanical\n\n   engineering, among others.\n\n11. For a tire to perform properly, it must be engineered so that the numerous components\n\n   and rubber compounds work together to carry the intended load at the inflation pressures\n\n   appropriate for the service applications. Thus, even tires bearing the same marketing\n\n   label or \"name\", like the \"LTX MIS\", have different design features to accommodate the\n\n   intended load and expected service application.\n\n12. Most modern automotive tires share some basic features. Virtually all tubeless tires have\n\n   a tread, belt assemblies, a body ply or plies, an inner liner, and bead wires. Steel belt\n\n   assemblies typically consist of two or more steel belts with a rubber compound that\n\n   surrounds and coats the steel cables. Textile body ply or plies generally consist of one or\n\n   more plies of textile cord coated with another rubber compound. The inner liner consists\n\n   of a different rubber compound and performs a function similar to that of an inner tube in\n\n   a tube-type tire, helping the tubeless tire maintain air pressure. The bead wires are two\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0337\n\f   hoop-shaped bundles of wire encased in rubber and located at the tire's inner edges,\n\n   which help hold the tire flush against the rim flange and anchor the tire's components.\n\n13. Most modern automotive tires are assembled in stages as a laminate structure and then\n\n   placed in a mold and vulcanized, or \"cured.\" Vulcanization consists of exposing the\n\n   assembled tire to high temperature and pressure for a pre-determined time; this process\n\n   causes various chemical changes in the rubber compounds, causes bonds to form between\n\n   the tire's various components, and increases the rubber's strength, resilience and\n\n   durability. A tire that has been assembled but not yet vulcanized is referred to as a \"green\n\n   tire.\"\n\n14. Despite this common basic strncture, however, it would be a gross oversimplification to\n\n   say that all passenger and light truck tires with a steel-belted radial construction are\n\n   similar in design. Although certain tires may share one or more common components or\n\n   compounds, the unique performance requirements of each tire will lead to design\n\n   differences between them.\n\n15. There are many ways in which tire designs may differ. For example, tire designs may\n\n   differ according to (I) the basic classification as a passenger, light truck, truck or\n\n   specialty tire; (2) inner diameter size; (3) width; (4) aspect ratio (the tire's width as\n\n   compared to its sidewall height); (5) load index or load capacity; (6) component\n\n   materials;    (7) intended   use   or   application;   (8) bead   wire   design;   (9) sidewall\n\n   reinforcements; (10) speed rating; (11) recommended inflation pressures; (l 2) tread\n\n   design; and (13) the use of additional components such as belt edge wedges and extra\n\n   strips or plies.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -4-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0338\n\f16. Most tires are broadly classified into four categories: passenger tires, light truck tires,\n\n   truck tires, and specialty-use tires (such as commercial tires, temporary spare tires, or\n\n   trailer tires). There are substantial differences in the design of tires in each classification.\n\n   Tires in one classification are not substantially similar to tires in another classification.\n\n   There are no Michelin tires in one classification that are \"common green\" to tires in\n\n   another classification. The federal regulations in place in 2001 governing light truck\n\n   tires, 49 C.F.R. § 571.119, was different than those governing passenger car tires like the\n\n   tire in question, 49 C.F.R. § 571.109.\n\n17. Plaintiffs' Requests for Production seek information on all \"Michelin LTX M/S tires.\"\n\n   The names of tire lines, such as \"LTX M/S,\" the line of the Subject Tire, are marketing\n\n   labels used by MNA to describe many tires that are suitable for use in a sport utility\n\n   vehicle (\"SUV\") or light truck application. They are not a designation of a tire's design\n\n   or a specific set of manufacturing specifications. The \"LTX MIS\" marketing label has\n\n   been used for at least 20 years, for multiple sizes, load ranges, and applications of tires.\n\n   Futther, \"LTX MIS\" tires are made in multiple sizes and load ranges, for different vehicle\n\n   fitments and applications, all of which would have different designs. At the time the tire\n\n   in question was manufactured in 2001, the \"LTX MIS\" label was used for approximately\n\n   40 different tire sizes. MNA uses many different marketing labels for its tires.\n\n18. For example, the LTX MIS tire line and its common green lines manufactured between\n\n   1998 and 2003 would encompass approximately 54 tire models built to more than 5000\n\n   tire specifications, and approximately 19.2 million different tires.        These tires were\n\n   manufactured at 5 different MNA and MNA (Canada), Inc. plants in North America.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0339\n\f19. All tires manufactured under the \"L TX MIS\" marketing label are not substantially\n\n   similar.   These tires differ in design in many ways, including size, load capacity,\n\n   components, number of plies, types of plies, recommended pressures, speed ratings, tread\n\n   depths, and intended applications.\n\n20. The Subject Tire is a 16\" P-Metric (Passenger) tire; however, the LTX M/S line\n\n   encompasses LT-Metric, P-Metric and Flotation tires.           Moreover, the LTX MIS line\n\n   includes tires with rim diameters ranging from 15\" to 17'' section widths from 205\n\n   millimeters to 285 millimeters, and with total diameters from 27\" to 32.8\". These tires of\n\n   different sizes, dimensions and applications are necessarily of different designs, and are\n\n   not substantially similar to each other.\n\n21. Tires of different sizes do not, as a general rule, merely have propo1tionally larger\n\n   dimensions; there are a number of other specification changes, as well. For example, an\n\n   LTX MIS 15\" tire will have very different performance requirements and expected\n\n   service conditions than an LTX MIS 17'' tire.           The carcass strength, load-carrying\n\n   capacity, inflation pressure, rubber compounds, number of carcass plies, and densities of\n\n   steel belt cables or polyester carcass ply cords may all be different, depending on tire size\n\n   and expected vehicle fitment. The tire designer will use different components, materials,\n\n   and configurations for different tire sizes, depending on the performance goals for the\n\n   tire. Thus, tires of different sizes are not substantially similar to each other.\n\n22. The LTX M/S line includes tires designed for original equipment fitments as well as tires\n\n   designed for the replacement market. Tires designed specifically for fitments on new\n\n   vehicles may be tuned specifically to meet the requirements of the original equipment\n\n   programs. They may be made of different components than replacement market tires,\n\n\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0340\n\f   have different tread depths and designs than replacement market tires, and have different\n\n   performance profiles than replacement market tires. Thus, original equipment tires may\n\n   have very different designs and constructions than replacement market tires, and are not\n\n   necessarily substantially similar to replacement market tires.\n\n23. The LTX M/S line of tires includes tires with different aspect ratios ranging from 65 to\n\n   85. The term \"aspect ratio\" describes the relationship between the height and width of\n\n   the tire.   More precisely, aspect ratio is the ratio between the \"section height\" (the\n\n   distance from the top of the tread down to an imaginary line running from bead to bead at\n\n   the bottom of the tire) and \"section width\" (the distance from the outermost bulge of one\n\n   sidewall to the other) when the tire is mounted on a rim that is 70% of the tire section\n\n   width and inflated to a prescribed pressure. A tire with a high aspect ratio may be a tall,\n\n   skinny tire, while one with a low aspect ratio may be a short, squatly tire. These different\n\n   structures are affected in different ways by the loads and forces that they encounter in\n\n   service, and the design of tires with different aspect ratios differ significantly. Tires of\n\n   different aspect ratios are not substantially similar.\n\n24. The LTX MIS line of tires encompasses tires with different load indexes and speed\n\n   ratings, which also make a difference in the application for which the tire is suitable. The\n\n   LTX M/S tire line includes tires with load indexes from 97 to 123 and speed ratings from\n\n   R to H. For example, an LTX M/S tire with \"H\" speed rating (130 mph) would have a\n\n   significantly different design than the Subject Tire, which has an \"S\" speed rating\n\n   (l 12mph), to accommodate the increased heat and centrifugal forces the tire would be\n\n   expected to withstand at higher speeds. For example, a P205/75Rl 5 97S LTX M/S,\n\n   which has a load index of97, is rated to carry a maximum load of 1435 pounds at 35 psi,\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0341\n\f   whereas the Subject Tire, which has a load index of 109, is rated to carry a maximum\n\n   load of2271 pounds at 35 psi. The design of these tires is different to accommodate the\n\n   differences in load and expected application. Thus, tires of different load indexes and\n\n   speed ratings are not substantially similar.\n\n25. Tires within the LTX MIS line differ according to their component materials, even when\n\n   the basic type, size, load index, and speed rating are the same. Among other differences,\n\n   tires within the LTX MIS line made in different plants contain different tread compounds,\n\n   and undertread compounds. In addition, steel belt construction and strength, as well as\n\n   polyester ply construction and strength, can differ. The tread compound is the material\n\n   comprising the outermost layer of the tire in the paii of the tire that is intended to contact\n\n   the road; the undertread compound is the material comprising the next layer down,\n\n   between the tread and steel belt assembly. Tire designs within the LTX MIS line can\n\n   differ for many other reasons, including tread designs, bead designs, recommended\n\n   inflation pressures, sidewall reinforcement, and others. Tires with these differences in\n\n   component materials and design features are not substantially similar.\n\n26. The LTX MIS line includes tires manufactured with 2-belt and 3-belt configurations.\n\n   Tires with different numbers of belts are not substantially similar.\n\n27. MNA uses many different rubber formulations in its tires, including different rubber\n\n   formulations between tires within the LTX MIS tire line. For example, all passenger and\n\n   light truck tires contain different types of rubber.     Rubber formulas in replacement-\n\n   market tires may differ from those used in certain original equipment applications.\n\n   MNA, through its MARC division, researches, tests, and develops the rubber compounds\n\n   used in the construction of tires. The type of rubber compound ultimately used in each\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 8-\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0342\n\f   component will affect the tire's performance results. Even within a single manufacturing\n\n   facility, the rubber compound formulas used may differ depending on the size and\n\n   application of the tire. Tires that use different rubber formulations are not substantially\n\n   similar.\n\n28. Tires are not substantially similar simply because they use the same belt skim compound.\n\n   Tires with the same belt skim but different sizes, classifications, load ranges, speed\n\n   ratings, and/or applications will have different designs and different service life, and are\n\n   not substantially similar tires.\n\n29. Tire designs evolve over time as new technology, materials, and equipment are\n\n   developed and the tire manufacturing processes and procedures in any given plant\n\n   change. Although bearing the same marketing label and size designation, tires that are\n\n   manufactured under different specifications are of different designs. Over the period of\n\n   time during which the model of the Subject Tire was made, changes were made to its\n\n   design and specifications.\n\n30. Tire designs generally will differ for tires manufactured at different facilities. Because\n\n   MNA operates facilities formerly owned by three different manufacturers (which use\n\n   different processes), manufacturing specifications and component compounds are\n\n   frequently different for tires otherwise of the same marketing label and size designation,\n\n   to account for varying plant-specific technology and available equipment, including\n\n   mixing equipment, tire building equipment, and curing methods.\n\n31. No two MNA plants have the exact same equipment and manufacturing processes.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0343\n\f32. Specifications are developed for the equipment and processes at a particular\n\n   manufacturing plant.       Tires manufactured at one plant are produced based on a\n\n    specification different than the specification used at other plants.\n\n33. In the last thirty (30) years, MNA has manufactured tires under several thousand different\n\n   brand names and sizes. Each of these tire types is of a different design. Within each\n\n   category, the designs have changed multiple times as the specifications evolved.\n\n34. In the last ten (! 0) years alone, MNA has manufactured several hundred million tires, to\n\n   tens of thousands of different specifications, including those marketed under the\n\n   \"Michelin,\" \"Uniroyal,\" \"BF Goodrich,\" and various private brand name.\n\n35. Certain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's adjustment data, including comparisons of\n\n   adjustment data concerning tires manufactured with and without nylon cap plies.\n\n36. Adjustment data is information collected by MNA that records the number of tires\n\n   returned, as well as the condition of the returned tire, without regard to cause.\n\n37. One condition which may be discerned by a trained inspector is a tread or tread/belt\n\n   \"separation.\" A \"separation\" refers to a crack or potential crack between two of a tire's\n\n   components. A \"separation,\" if actually present, does not mean or imply that the tire\n\n   became disabled. It also does not mean or imply that the tire is defective in design or\n\n   manufacture. If the inspector observed a tread/belt separation in a returned tire, that\n\n   condition would be noted and the adjustment would be coded accordingly.\n\n38. Tread/belt detachments resulting from separations occur infrequently, but they have\n\n   occurred and do occur in steel belted radial tires generally, regardless of their size,\n\n   design, or intended use.\n\n39. A tread/belt separation can occur in any steel belted radial tire.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0344\n\f40. A tread/belt separation in a tire does not indicate a defect in the design or manufacture of\n\n   the tire because there are many different causes for tread/belt separation that are\n\n   independent of the design and manufacture of the tire. Numerous other factors, such as\n\n   tire overloading, under inflation, unrepaired or improperly repaired punctures or cuts,\n\n   damage from road hazards, to name a few, can lead to tread/belt separation in a properly\n\n   designed and manufactured tire.\n\n41. The MNA's design and manufacturing specifications, specification changes, testing and\n\n   design-related documents requested by Plaintiffs in their discovery requests contain\n\n   highly protected trade secrets of MNA.          In addition, Plaintiffs requests call for the\n\n   production of other highly protected trade secrets of MNA, including but not limited to\n\n   information concerning MNA's research and development, formulas, tire adjustment\n\n   processes and analysis, marketing strategies, internal research and studies, propriety\n\n   manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n42. Furthermore, MNA's adjustment data is of significant value to MNA because it reveals\n\n   MNA's processes and analysis, and because it is not known to MNA's competitors. This\n\n   information constitutes valuable trade secrets of MNA and gives MNA an advantage over\n\n   its competitors.    Disclosure of this information to those competitors would cause\n\n   irreparable damage to MNA.\n\n43. Ce1tain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's design and manufacturing specifications,\n\n   specification changes, testing and design-related documents, research and development,\n\n   tire adjustment processes and analysis, internal research and studies, propriety\n\n   manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n   All such documents are highly protected trade secrets ofMNA.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 11 -\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0345\n\f44. MNA spends millions of dollars each year on research, development, testing of tires and\n\n   their component parts, and developing its proprietary design and manufacturing\n\n   technologies. Disclosure of this information to those competitors would cause irreparable\n\n   damage to MNA's competitive advantage.\n\n45. MNA takes extreme care to protect this information from being disclosed because this\n\n   information is what gives MNA an advantage in the competitive field of tire design and\n\n   allows it to deliver economic value to its customers. MNA derives economic value and\n\n   competitive advantage by not having that information available in the public domain.\n\n   Any disclosure, direct or indirect, of such trade secrets and confidential information\n\n   would severely and permanently impair MNA's competitive position.\n\n46. Disclosure of MNA's confidential information to multiple individuals would subject\n\n   MNA to a substantial risk of subsequent disclosure to MNA's competitors, the\n\n   consequences of which would be irreversible.\n\n47. The steps that MNA has in place to protect the secrecy of its confidential design and\n\n   development information include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n          (a)     An 8-foot high cyclone topped with barbed wire fence surrounds the\n\n                  perimeter ofMARC's facility and premises in Greenville, South Carolina;\n\n          (b)     All employees access the premises through a gated entrance by use of a\n\n                 limited access turnstile and badge reader.

Thereafter,\n\n                  the MNA employee escorts or supervises the visitor(s), who must display\n\n                  \"Visitor\" credentials while on the premises.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\n\n                                                                                         MR 0346\n\f          (c)     The security gates are manned Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to\n\n                  5:00 p.m. aud patrolled by security all other hours, weekends, and\n\n                  holidays.    In addition, the entire MARC campus and its perimeter is\n\n                  monitored 24 hours a day by surveillance cameras;\n\n          (d)     While vehicles generally are not allowed on MNA's premises, if a vehicle\n\n                  does enter, it is subject to a random search by security before it is\n\n                  permitted to exit;\n\n          (e)     To the extent MNA maintains its confidential design and development\n\n                  information electronically, it is stored in a secure, limited access database;\n\n          (f)     MNA's       employees   execute   stringent   non-disclosure    and    secrecy\n\n                  agreements as a condition of their employment;\n\n          (g)     MNA's vendors sign confidentiality agreements before they are provided\n\n                  access to any documents or information regarding MNA's work for them;\n\n          (h)     The research and development information developed by MNA at MARC\n\n                  is maintained at MARC; and\n\n          (i)     Certain areas on the MARC campus are accessible only to MARC\n\n                  personnel with heightened security access, and are not accessible to other\n\n                  MNA employees.\n\n48. MNA employs these extreme efforts to maintain the confidentiality of information\n\n   relating to its testing, research, technology, processes, designs, compilations of\n\n   information, and formulas because it is this information that gives MNA and its clients an\n\n   advantage in the competitive field of tire design and manufacture.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 13 -\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0347\n\f49. I understand Plaintiffs are requesting documents and/or testimony concerning one or\n\n   more ofMNA's rubber compound formulas.\n\n50. For many decades, MNA has spent millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of man\n\n   hours researching, testing, and developing rubber formulas in an effort to increase the\n\n   performance of its tires. The rubber compound formulas are of significant value to MNA\n\n   because they are not known to MNA's competitors.\n\n51. MNA believes that its superior rubber compound formulas are an extremely critical factor\n\n   in its ability to maintain its competitive advantage over its rivals.\n\n52. Because a tire is vulcanized during manufacture (a process that alters the tire's chemistry\n\n   and dimensions), it cannot be \"reverse engineered.\" Thus, a competitor cannot recreate\n\n   all of its design specifications simply by purchasing and analyzing a tire, nor can a\n\n   competitor take a tire apaii and determine the components in the rubber, the length of\n\n   time the rubber is cured, or the machinery used.\n\n53. In addition to the measures discussed above, MNA takes even more extreme steps to\n\n   protect its compound formula information. Only MNA employees who have a business\n\n   need to know the information have access to the formulas. Of MNA's thousands of\n\n   employees, only a few know or have access to the rubber compound formulas.\n\n54. Any disclosure, direct or indirect, of MNA's compound formulas would severely and\n\n   permanently impair MNA 's competitive position. Once disclosed, this damage could not\n\n   be repaired, even if the disclosure was inadvertent and/or subject to a confidentiality\n\n   order.\n\n55. Plaintiffs have also requested information and documents relating to MNA's\n\n   manufacturing and quality procedures.\n\n\n\n\n                                            - 14 -\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0348\n\f56. Like all tire manufacturers, MNA keeps secret its specific design, manufacturing, and\n\n   quality assurance processes. MNA's specific manufacturing processes and equipment are\n\n   not known to MNA's competitors or the general public.            MNA has developed the\n\n   processes, including manufacturing techniques, machinery, and methods of production,\n\n   for many decades at a cost of many millions of dollars. MNA also spends millions of\n\n   dollars every year replacing and updating facilities and equipment. A principal part of\n\n   MNA's competitive edge in the tire industry derives from its proprietary and unique\n\n   manufacturing methods and equipment. Most of MNA's processes are not patented for\n\n   fear of losing their secrecy.\n\n57. The divulgence ofMNA's proprietary manufacturing and quality processes to the public\n\n   or to a competitor would cause an unacceptably high risk of irreparable harm and injury.\n\n   If third parties were allowed access to these trade secrets, they could take advantage of\n\n   proprietary information which MNA has spent years and millions of dollars developing,\n\n   and which MNA's competitors could not duplicate on their own without a similar\n\n   investments of time, expe1tise, and money, and perhaps not even then. The damage that\n\n   could be created by the loss of trade secrets is a direct financial threat to MNA, its parent\n\n   and affiliated corporations, and risks the loss ofMNA's competitive edge and, potentially\n\n   the employment of thousands of employees tlll'oughout the United States and worldwide.\n\n58. MNA spends millions of dollars and countless man hours developing manufacturing\n\n   processes and quality procedures. Specifically, MNA's building procedures employed at\n\n   the Dothan plant were developed over an extensive amount of time and at tremendous\n\n   expense.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 15 -\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0349\n\f59. MNA takes extraordinary measures to maintain the secrecy of its proprietary\n\n   manufacturing processes and equipment, including the following:\n\n          (a)    Plants are not open to the public. Facilities are surrounded by fences. The\n\n                 Dothan plant maintains a security department with security systems and\n\n                 security officers.\n\n          (b)    Additional security controls are imposed in certain departments because of\n\n                 the highly confidential manufacturing and industrialization work that is\n\n                 carried on in those departments. Persons with access authority are subject\n\n                 to strict control, and employees with access authority are required to\n\n                 execute confidentiality agreements.       Employees are not permitted to\n\n                 photograph or videotape the interior of the plant and are not permitted to\n\n                 remove documentary trade secrets except for controlled, business\n\n                 purposes.\n\n          (c)    MNA does not generally permit third persons to enter any plant unless\n\n                 there is a legitimate business reason. Each visitor must wear a badge\n\n                 denoting his or her status and the extent of their access within the plant\n\n                 was limited based on business need and prior approval, with signed\n\n                 secrecy agreements in many instances. The MNA employee with whom\n\n                 the visitor is meeting has to accompany the visitor until the conference is\n\n                 terminated and the visitor leaves the plant.\n\n          (d)    Many of the production machines at the MNA plants are designed, built,\n\n                 and/or modified and installed by MNA itself.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 16 -\n\n\n                                                                                         MR 0350\n\f                (e)   Employees at MNA plants sign stringent non-disclosure and secrecy\n\n                      agreements as a condition of their employment.\n\n   60. The tire development and manufacturing industry is extremely competitive and is\n\n       dependent on continuing research and development of new tire products and component\n\n       parts.\n\n   61. The information concerning MNA's manufacturing processes, design processes, testing\n\n       and testing methods, green tire specifications, compounds, and components of tires,\n\n       including those pertaining to the Subject Tire, is of significant value to MNA because it\n\n       reveals MNA's design, testing, and analytical processes. T his is information that is not\n\n       known to MNA's competitors. Disclosure of this information to those competitors would\n\n       cause irreparable damage to MNA's competitive advantage.\n\n\n\n\nFURTHER, AFFIANT SAITH NAUGHT.\n\n\n\n\nSWORN to and subscribed

Has Michelin produced the docu1nents?\n                 A.      The answer is an absolute: NO.\n\n\n1 Please see Plaintiffs' Separate State1nent of Moving Counsel attached as Exhibit JJ, •vhich proves\nPlaintiff<;' repeated meets and confers with Michelin, Please also sec Plaintiffs' multiple exchanges of\ncorrespondence with Michelin attached hereto as Exhibit G. Regardless of undersigned counsel's\ncountless efforts to reach out, Michelin continues to refuse production of necessary evidence for Plaintiffs\nto fairly adjudicate their clahns. Jn other words, PlaintijjS still tlo not ltave the doc11n1ents,\n2\n  Michelin's \"trade secret\" argu1nent holds no \\Yater. First, \\tlichelin failed to prove the requested\ninfor111ation is a trade secret because the law requires that the \"subject 1natter of a trade secret nlust be\nsecret.\" Sten art & ~<:;tevenson ,'Jervices, Inc. v. /ierv-Tech, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1752590\"><a href=\"/opinion/1752590/stewart-stevenson-services-inc-v-serv-tech-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95 (Tex.

Michelin's only evidence of trade secrets are conclusory state1nents.\nSecond, there is already a Michelin Protective ()rdcr in place that protects it. TI1erefore, Michelin's\ntrade secret objection is a red herring.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          MR 0434\n\f        TherefOre, Plaintiffs file their Reply in support of their Motion to Compel to talk about\n\nthe real issue: Michelin's refusal to produce documents. For manufacturing purposes, the\n\nei1tire I..,TX M/S li11e is the same. The physical evidence proves it.

Mothers, sisters,\n\nhusbands, -fathers. All innocent viclin1s initially injured severely by the defective J_,TX then by\n\nMichelin's awful litigation tactics - both as a result of Michelin's secretive defective and\n\nshoddy tire design, manufacturing and inspection practices. t'or in;;tance, in Velo, there were\n\nseven (7) passengers inside the SlJV. One (1) was lcilled, One (I) becmnc a quadriplegic.\n\nThree (3) suffered traun1atic brain injuries. And all suffered a inullitude of other injuries. So\n\nevery one of Michelin's tread belt separations leads to many, many n1ore victims including\n\nvicti1ns not at the scene of t11e crash. l\"or instance, the dead father left ;;everal children witl1out\n\na dad. T'he quadriplegic inother left ;;everal children with a ;;evercly disabled mother. So, one\n\n(I) single defective tire injured and victinlized n1ore than ten (10) individuals.\n\n       'I11ere are so many inorc. Plaintiffs know this because in Velo, when it;; back was\n\nagainst the wall due to its lack of disclosure, Michelin was forced to cough up its own intc111al\n\nnumbers about the L]'X MIS tire line defeciive returns·· irrespective of width, 1i1n size, aspcci\n\nratios or s1)eed ratings. To put it mildly, the evidence was frightening.\n\n   II. LTX M/S's Plague ofJ)efccts\n\n       For starters, n1ore than 700 (inst ft·on1 one of its hundreds of dealers and the largest tire\n\nretailer in the world - Discount 1'ire) of its defective I..TX MIS tires were returned for belt edge\n\nseparations. In addition, over l,000 tires were returned to Michelin';; dealers for ride vibration\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\n\n\n                                                                                                     MR 0437\n\f    a precursor to tread belt separation.    1·his staggering number of many n1ore than 1.500\n\ndefective tires den1onstrates, docu1nents and proves that Michelin h:new- as early as 2001 (10\n\nyears bef'Ore the incident) - that its IJ TX MIS tire line was dru1gerously defective. Michelin had\n\nto disgorge all this evidence ti·om the I,'fX MIS line whether they were 235s, 245s, 265s, 275s\n\ntread width or whether it is 16 or 17 rin1 size or whether they had ditferent speed ratings\n\nsiinilarly to what PlaintiffS are asking here.\n\n         Instead of warning the public about its defective product, 6, Michelin did and continues\n\nto do the exact opposite: conceal from the public and its consun1ers that. its IJ l'X line posed and\n\nposes unreasonable risks of deadly danger to its consumers.              This adjustme11t/warranty\n\ninfo11nation and evidence was provided in Velo to counsel, undersigned counsel used it ii1 their\n\ncase to annihilate Michelin. ·rhis is the only reason Michelin now refuses to produce it. It is\n\nimportant to note that the defective nature of the 1:rx MIS line ru1d its injury rate is not a\n\nnational scandal because in every case, Michelin blackmails the Plaintiffs into protective orders\n\nand nan·ow discovery or will not produce anything.\n\n    lll. Texas Scope of J)iscovery\n\n        rrhus, lil(e any crin1e, there is a motive behind Michelin's stonewalling: prevent the\n\ndisclosure of Michelin's shoddy tire design, manufacturing, inspection practices ·-directly at\n\nissue in this case - to prevent the public knowledge of its defective tires. fortunately, Texas\n\nlaw does not pe1mit it.

(c.a.).\n\n        Michelin and its legal counsel knew their n1istruth to the federal district court would be\n\neasily exposed. It was blatant and easily dispelled by physical evide11ce. Still, they did not care\n\nbecause in the end, they got their reward. They delayed the case for an entire year. No scruples,\n\nNo concerns. No honor. No good fl:iith. 'fhat is Michelin's entire game. Delay. Mislead.\n\nObfuscate. Prevent trials on the merits. We ask that the Honorable Court to not allow it.\n\nConclusion: A year later, not11ing has changed. Just like in .Bates, Michelin still has the same\n\nstrategy: delay.     Plagued with infections and bed sores, the quadriplegic Obdulia's daily\n\nexistence is a struggle. ()bdu!ia is out oftiine.\n\n       Also, with loon1ing pretrial deadlines including expe1i disclosures, disclosure 1nust be\n\nmade. Michelin will use its lack of production to file sumn1ary judg1nc11ts, ]Jaubert n1otions and\n\nfurther clain1 that Plaintiffs' experts do not have foundation for their opinions. 1.''his is the best\n\nevidence that such absconded evidence is needed for Plaintiffs to fairly adjudicate their claims.\n\nAll extre1nely   pr~judicial   and unfair to the innocent Plaintiffs and their fmnily.

The failed tire caused the vehicle to go out of control and roll\n 5 over. Kimberly was trapped in the vehicle for close to an hour, hanging from her seatbelt while the\n\n 6 emergency responders atte1npted to extract her. Kimberly suffered severe injuries to her leg/ankle as\n 7 well as to her ann. It took many surgeries and months of recovery before Kimberly was on her feet\n 8 again, and tl1e job she was excited about starting was no longer available.\n 9            The tire at issue is a P215/70R15 Uniroyal Tiger Paw AWP 1I tire, manufaetured at MNA's\n10 Ardmore, Oklahoma plant (\"The Subject Tire\").

See e.g., Sanction Order in Bates v. MNA, attached as\n      Exhibit B; see also Sanction Order in (}uzn1an v. MNA, attached as Exhibit C. In the Joint Report filed\n      almost a year ago, Plaintiff addressed this concern: \"In tl1e past, the Plaintiff's attorneys had a difficult\n1S time obtaining timely, complete, and accurate responses to tl1eir discovery requests from defendant\n17 Michelin North America.\" ,)\"ee June 13, 2014 Joint Report at p. 4.

On December 12, 2014, Plainti'ffreceived MNA's responses,\n24\n      which stated: \"MNA objects to the extent this Interrogatory seeks or attempts to seek trade secret,\n25\n      proprietary, or othenvise co1nmercially confidential.\" S\"ee MNA 's Responses to NU Is at p. 3, Ex hi bi I\n26\n      D. MNA 1nade this objection despite the fact that the Court had entered a PO with a Heightened\n27\n      Confidentiality Clause, \\Vhich protects all of MNA's confidential docu1nents. A heightened\n28\n\n\n                                                                                                       MR 0463\n\f                  1 confidentiality clause is an extreme protection generally only entered in patent cases, or in litigation\n                  2 against direct competitors. With this PO, MNA has no excuse for its failure to answer discovery.\n                  3           MNA also took it upon itself to edit Plaintiffs request and restricted its answers to: \"the\n                  4 Subject Tire and tires manufactured to the specification in place for the Subject Tire at the Ardmore,\n\n                  5 Oklahoma plant during the six rnonths before and the sjx 1nonths after the date. of 111anufucturc of the\n                  6 Subject Tire.\" See j(f. at p. 2, Exhibit D. By this means, MNA decided it would create its own\n\n                  7 discovery rules and defined this as ~'the Relevant Scope.\" Then, MNA refused to ans\\.ver discovery that\n                  8 did not fall within this self-defined \"relevant scope.\" For example, many of Ms. Allen's requests relate\n                 9    to MN A's notice of other incident or clailns in which consumers alleged tread separations or other\n                10 defects involving the same model tire. Other requests involve testing performed by or on behalf of'\nw\n~~              11 MNA that does not relate specifically to any one model tire, but instead relates to MN A's knowledge\ng.~.,,          12\nCJ)   enc.,.,         regarding the cause of tread separations. MNA failed to answer any of these requests.\n0 .p!;; !;;\n    i\"\" :6 13\no6 ~ ~     N            ivfNA also made numerous objections which have no support under Arizona law. For example,\nt!1 e \"\":::.\n~Et!~\nw   . . :i ~ 14 M'NA refused to identify anyone with knowledge about the design or manufacture of the subject tire\n\"\"~\nc_, w        15\n0 :g            clai1ning it did not have to answer interrogatories until the fact witness deadline. See MN A's\n(!l ~\n                1 6 supplemental responses to NU! 3, 4, 6 and 11, attached as Exhibit E.\n                17           Not only docs Rule 26. 1 require that MNA provide fact witness information in its lnitinl\n                1 8 Disclosure, but Plaintiff also specifically requested this information in an interrogatory.\n                19           Moreover, the Court's Scheduling Order instn1cted: \"This order does not replace the parties'\n                20 obligation to seasonably disclose Rule 26.l information on an on-going basis and as it becomes\n                21 available.\" See Dcce1nber 4, 2014 Scheduling Order. MNA's refhsal to identify lay witnesses is n\n                22 direct violation of this Court's order and alone is grounds for sanctions. By MNA's refusal to identiry\n                23 any witnesses until the fact witness deadline {April 27, 2015), MNA leaves Plaintiff only t\\vo months\n                2 4 (June 26, 2015) to depose these out of state individuals.\n                25           MNA also refused to answer interrogatories stating that Ms. Allen is required to subpoena n\n                2 6 30{b)(6) witness if she wanted responses. This has no support under Arizona law, and actually negates\n                2 7 the entire purpose of serving inten·ogatories.\n                28           One of the MNA's 1no:-;t confusing objections can be found in MNA's objections to Plaintiff's\n                                                                         4\n                                                                                                                  MR 0464\n\f                1 NUl' s 3) 5 and 6, Exhibit D.

This \"meet and confer\" was between Plaintiffs counsel and\n 8\n     MNA's discovery counsel, which is now the third law firm currently representing MNA in this\n 9\n     lawsuit. MNA is currently represented by Farhang & Medcoff from Arizona, Yukevich Cavanaugh\n10\n     from Los Angeles, CA, and now Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP from South Carolina.\n11\n             During the meet and conferi Plaintiff provided her proposal regarding the scope of discovery.\n     See Feb1uary 12, 2015 email to MNA coun.o:;el, attached as Exhibit K. MNA responded with its O\\Vn\n     proposal. This Proposal required Ms. Allen to waive her right to seek court intervention to all of her\n     issues regarding MNA_'s discovery responses as a condition precedent to receiving only a few\n     additional responses from MNA.             See February 20, 2015 email from Giles Schanen, attached as\n16\n     Exhibit L:\" MNA will agree to provide the above information and documents only if doing so 'vill\n17\n     resolve all issues   \\Vi th   regard to plaintifPs discovery requests, and if plaintiff 'viii agree to tOrego\n18\n     a request for a plant inspection.\" Id.\n19\n            For the tire testing information Ms. Allen requested, MNA has made no offer to expand the\n20\n     scope of discovery in tenns of the types of tires even thot1gh many of the requests seek information\n21\n     about MN A's knowledge of tread separation causes and testing, which is not specific to a single tire.\n22\n            MNA's offer to supple1nent was still excessively restrictive and still failed to comply with\n23\n     Arizona's discovery rules. Ms. Allen was required inake this agreement before even having the chance\n24\n     to review the docu1nents MNA intended to disclose. What is tnore, Ms. Allen would have to withdra\\v\n25\n     t1vcnt-v of her requests in exchange for MNA expanding its \"Relevant Scope\" to three years rather\n26\n     than one, when even three years is too limited under Alizona law.

Plaintiff explained that the proper procedure for discovery is \"for Michelin to disclose\n                  6   the information, allow for the Plaintiff to examine it, and then if there are further issues, have\n\n                  7   the Court determine the narrow issues on \\Vhich \\Ve cannot agree.''

Despite the verhillge\n                 1 9 in MNA's correspondence that it has gone above and beyond and \"bent and bent,\" MNA providing a\n\n                 20 few select documents it is already required to provide is not an exceptional effort.

It simply argues\n9::!\n0$\n             15            that the infonnation was costly to develop and that if the materials were to fall into the\n<!)                        hands of its competitors, it might or could result in its competitors obtaining\n             16            infonnation concen1ing how they how inight iinprove the quality and perfo1mance of\n             17            their products. Such vague conclusions regarding the value of these documents and\n                           their possible use by General Motors' competitors are insufficient grounds for a\n             18            protective order, and fall short of the good cause requirement of the iule.\n\n             19 Id. at 610; N.E.2d at 1201.\n             20           Ms. Allen's medical records are statutorily protected by Federal law. Yet, Ms. Allen is required\n             21    to produce all of her incdical records including sensitive psychological counseling records. Ms. Allen\n             22 disclosed her medical records without a PO. l\\ifNA, has a PO and as a result no excuse for failing to\n             23 answer Ms. Allen's discovery requests, or provide full disclosures.\n             24           Plaintiff only agreed to the entry of the PO on the good faith basis that MNA would 1nake full\n             25\n                   and complete disclosures and to elhninate MNA's boilerplate objections to «trade secrets\" and\n             26\n                   \"co1nmercially sensitive\" material. This has not been the case. Despite the entry of the n1ost extrerne\n             27\n                   type of PO, MNA refused to answer fourteen !H:} of Plaintiff's discovery request, claiining the\n             28\n                                                                       17\n                                                                                                                  MR 0477\n\f 1 responses constitute \"trade secrets.\" See MNA 1s privilege log, attached as Exhibit U.                  MNA's\n 2\n     responses to Plaintiff's discovery are as obstructionist as they would be \\.Yithout any PO.\n 3\n            With a \"heightened confidentiality\" provision in place, a Defendant should never be objecting\n 4\n     to the request of documents because lt requires disclosure of a \"trade secret,\" or \"commercially\n 5\n     sensitive.\" 'frade secret and commercially sensitive information is, by definition, the entire purpose ot\n 6\n 7 the entry of a PO. MNA's trade secret objections are in bad faith, unsupported by the law and\n\n 8   purposefully obstructionist.\n\n 9 VII.     CONCLUSION:\n1O          Wherefore, Ms. Allen respectfully requests that this Court enter an Order compelling MNA to\n\n11   supple1nent its discovery answers, and for an order awarding Ms. Allen the cost and fees associated\n\n     with bringing this Motion.\n\n            Dated this t::i\"'dayof April, 2015.\n\n                                                     GOLDBERG & OSBORNE\n\n\n\n18\n                                                            /£._,y\n                                                             /L~.                    ~,;:;:;\"-~   . .\n                                                     13 y   ;r;·/ /      ___\".::-::~:-~---------\n17                                                             John E.

The tire that failed was on the rear of the family's vehicle. The forces exerted on the\n\n            10    vehicle from the separation caused a loss of control and led to the vehicle's rolling over down an\n            11    embankment on the 5 freeway. Carlos's wife Sylvia and his daughter Elena were killed in the\n\n            12    crash. The tire at issue is a P245/75 R 16 Long Trail TIA model tire manufactured at Michelin's\n            13    Ardmore plant during the 481h week of 1998. The discovery at issue in this motion specifically\n            14    relates to MNA's notice of lawsuits for personal injury and wrongful death or property damage\n\n            15    claims in which consumers alleged a tread separation incident involving the exact same size and\n            16    model tire.\n            17                   Defendant MNA has unnecessarily· delayed providing appropriate responses to\n            18    simple, yet important, discovery requests. Although Plaintiffs' counsel has repeatedly attempted\n\n            19    to meet and confer about certain deficient responses, the meet-and-confer process has been\n            20    unproductive. SpecificaJly, Defendant has failed to provide a fu1I and complete response to\n\n            21    Request for Production No. 18 (which is the sole issue of this Motion), which was served on\n\n            22    MNA on August 13, 2009.     \"fhis request, which is crucial to this case seeks the following\n\n            23    materials:\n\n            24                  REQUEST NO. 18\n            25                          All DOCUMENTS or WRITINGS relating or referring to\n            26                  any report of a full or partial tread separation of a Uniroyal Laredo\n\n            27                  tire or any SIMILAR PRODUCT which was manufactured between\n            28                   1996 and 2005 that YOU have received, including but not limited to\n\n\ntA16. 387                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n                                                                                                             MR 0486\n\f            1\n                                lawsuits for personal injury or wrongful death, or property damage\n\n            2\n                                 claims, or correspondence.

The entirety of the documents (4 pages) produced by MNA in its initial response is\n\n           10   attached to the Declaration of Christine D. Spagnoli as Exhibit 1. Michelin also attempted to\n\n           11   unilaterally limit the scope of the request to tires manufactured within the 6 months before and the\n\n           12   6 months after the subject tire (basically June 1998 to J uue 1999). Immediately after the initial\n\n           13   responses were received, Plaintiffs' counsel sent a meet-and-confer letter pointing out the obvious\n\n           14   deficiencies in the responses, and asking for a supplemental response. MNA's counsel agreed to\n\n           15   supplement the responses by January 15, 2010. As that date approached, MNA's counsel asked\n\n           16   for additional time, and promised that supplement responses would be provided.\n\n           17                   In the face of these delays, Plaintiffs' counsel continued to press MNA's counsel\n\n           18   for production of the non-privileged records concerning these other incidents, as well as further\n\n           19   expansion of the scope to include other similarly designed tires. In the meantime, Plaintiffs'\n\n           20   counsel served additional discovery to determine what, if any, information MNA hiid in its\n\n           21   possession about these other tires and whether it even had the failed tires available for inspection\n\n           22   by plaintiffs's experts. As a result of these discovery efforts, it was ultimately determined that\n\n           23   MNA had, in fact, obtained possession of many of the failed tires which were the subject of claims\n\n           24   and lawsuits, had investigators inspect and photograph these tires, and then after resolving those\n\n           25   clai.ms, destroyed the tires.\n\n           26                   Finally, after Plaintiffs' counsel's continuing attempts to obtain further responses to\n\n           27   Request #18, on March 30, 2010, MNA produced an additional piece of paper on which it listed\n\n           28   the names of four additional lawsuits which purportedly stemmed from tread separations involving\n\n\n                                                                  -4-\n1A16.3B7                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n                                                                                                            MR 0487\n\f              1   the same mode] tire. This new piece of paper did not identify the tires invo1ved in the incidents.\n\n              2\n                  No other documentation of these incidents wa'> provided. The next day (March 31, 2010) at a\n\n              3   deposition of a representative of MN A regarding the design and manufacture of the subject model\n\n              4\n                  tire, MNA's counsel hand-wrote the DOT numbers for the tires involved in these additional four\n\n              5   incidents on MNA 4195.\n\n              6                   As a result, as of April 1, 2010, despite a delay of more 1han 8 mon1hs, MNA has\n\n              7   not produced a single document in its possession concerning any of the incidents identified on any\n\n              8   of the five pieces of paper identifying 119 consumer complaints and the 26 tread separation\n\n              9   property damage claims and lawsuits involving ofP245/75R 16 Longtrail TIA tires. MNA has\n\n            10    failed to explain the scope of its production, failed to produce documents about these incidents and\n\n            11    failed to provide mandatory statements of compliance explaining its lack of production. These\n\n            ·12   inadequate responses are adverse1y prejudicing P1aintiffs' counsel's trial preparation, are required\n\n            13    by law, and as a consequence, the Court must grant this Motion and impose monetary sanctions so\n\n            14    that Plaintiffs can obtain complete discovery responses.\n\n            15\n\n            16                                                       II.\n\n            17                         STATEMENT O~' FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n            18                   On August 13, 2009, Plaintiffs sent a Request for Production of Documents, Set\n\n            19    One, to MNA. (See Plaintiffs' Request for Production of Documents, Set One, attached as Exhibit\n\n            20    2to1he Declaration of Christine D. Spagnoli.) As would be explained to MNA in Plaintiffs' meet-\n\n            21    and-confer letter and as set forth in P1aintiffs' concurrently filed Separate Statement of Discovery\n\n            22    in Dispute, these requests sought very specific documentary evidence concerning the design of the\n\n            23    Subject Mode] Tire and similar models as well as MNA's manufacturing processes and quality\n\n            24    contro1 practices. Since there are signs of both design and manufacturing defects in the Subject\n\n            25    Tire and such allegations form the basis of Plaintiffs' complaint, documentary evidence related to\n\n            26    the design of the Subject Model Tire and evidence related to the quality control and manufacturing\n\n            27    practices at the Ardmore plant are highly relevant, indeed critical, to the central issues in this case.\n\n            28\n\n                                                                    -5-\nlA.16.387                  MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO REQUEST FQR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n\n                                                                                                               MR 0488\n\f             1                      MNA served responses on September 14, 2009, indicating it would produce\n\n             2\n                 confidential materia1 only upon the entry of a suitable protective order. (See Responses to\n\n             3   Plaintiffs Request for Production of Documents, Set One, attached as Exhibit 3 to the Declaration\n\n             4\n                 of Christine D. Spagnoli.) Plaintiffs then sent their lengthy meet-and-confer letter, including the\n\n             5   proposition that the parties simply agree to an Order previously agreed to by MNA in another case.\n\n             6   (See Meet-and-Confer letter dated September 24, 2009, attached as Exhibit 4 to the Declaration of\n\n             7   Christine D.

On\n\n            10   December 8, 2009, Plaintiffs' counsel sent yet another meet-and-confer letter, which indicated that\n\n            11   MNA's responses were still inadequate. (See Meet-and-Confer letter dated December·S, 2009,\n\n            12   attached as Exhibit 5 to the Declaration Of Christine D. Spagnoli.) Specifically, the December 8th\n\n            13   letter addressed Request Number 18 (which is the sole subject of this Motion); this section of the\n\n            14   letter provided:\n\n            15             In order to fully comply with this request, MNA must produce a complete list\n\n            16              ofall claims and lawsuits/or the subject model tire, regardless ofwhen the\n\n            17              incidents occurred, and including the date MNA received notice ofthe\n\n            18              incident. MNA also must provide a complete record ofchanges made to the\n\n            19             subject model tire, before and after it was manufactured, so that we can\n\n            20             evaluate whether the limitation to one year post manufacture as a \"relevant\n\n            21             scope\" is appropriate. Finally, MNA must. produce all of the foandational,\n\n            22             non-privileged materials related to these claims and lawsaits, such as\n\n            23             trafflC collision reports and photographs, and provide a privilege log for\n\n            24             any privileged materials that are being withheld, such as notes of\n\n            25             inspections of the tires by MNA consultants or investigators. Accordingly,\n\n            26             please supplement this response and provide all responsive documents and/or\n\n            27             a proper statement of compliance.\n\n            28\n\n                                                                 -6-\n1A16. 387                 MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TQ REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION, SET ONE\n\n\n                                                                                                           MR 0489\n\f             l\n                                 In addition to the above letter, Plaintiffs' counsel sent another meet-and-confer\n\n             2   letter on December 15, 2009, which again discussed Defendant's deficient responses to Request\n\n             3   No. 18. (See December 15, 2009 letter attached as Exhibit 6 to the Declaration of Christine D.\n\n             4   Spagnoli.) MNA's connsel promised supplemental responses by January 15, 2010, but then\n                 requested an extension, which Plaintiffs granted to February 1, 2010. However, February           1~ 1\n             5\n\n             6   passed and MNA had still failed to provide responses. On Fehroary 26, 2010, MNA's counsel sent\n\n             7   a letter to Plaintiffs' counsel which indicated that they were still working on the suppJemental\n\n             8   responses. (See February 26, 2010 letter attached as Exhibit 7 to the Declaration of Christine D.\n\n             9   Spagnoli.) Finally, on March 30, 2010, MNA identified 4 additional lawsuits, but still did not\n\n            10   produce any of the foundational documents concerning those incidents or the other incidents\n\n            11   identified earlier. (See Letter dated March 29, 2010 sent Fed Ex and MNA 4195 attached as\n\n            12   Exhibit 8 to the Declaration of Christine D. Spagnoli.)\n\n            13                   Given the rapidly approaching trial date ap.d MNA's failure to respond to PJaintiffs'\n\n            14   requests (for which Plaintiffs granted MNA numerous extensions to respond, and attempted to\n\n            15   meet and confer about numerous times), Plaintiffs have no choice but to file a motion to compel\n\n            16   Defendant MNA to respond to Request for Production No. 18.\n\n            17\n\n            18                                                      III.\n\n            19            A MOTION TO COMPEL FURTHER RESPONSES TO A DEMAND FOR\n\n            20     PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS IS AUTHORIZED PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIA\n\n            21                              CODE OF CML PROCEDURE § 2031.310.\n\n            22                   The right to discovery is broad in California, and plaintiff.<; seek highly relevant\n\n            23   ·infonnation.

Michelin\n\nDear Chris:\n\n       Your last two (2) letters are a misrepresentation of what has happened\nconce1ning production of docu1nents and are outright inaccurate. Moreover,\nconcerning your third letter, for all intents and purposes, I stick by it. However, other\nadjectives whicl1 also accurately characterize Michelin's prior actions and recent\nproposal include: dishonest, deceptive and misleading.              Michelin's lack of\nconsideration for the numerous innocent victims such as Obdulia Medina, Sandra Velo\nand many, many others throughout the years caused by its shoddy and defective tires -\ncoupled with its lack of disclosure about it··· demonstrates a corporate culture 1hat has\nno place in our modern society.\n\n       Yours/Michelin's request that Plaintiffs \"identify codes\" reveals Michelin's\nbad faith discovery tactics since Michelin still has not produced 1he Code Sheets for\nAdjustment Data including but not limited to \"List of Objective or Subjective\nDamages: Expert Codification.\" 1bus, Michcli11's most recent \"proposal\" is more of\n1hc same: intentional refusal to produce discoverable evidence.\n\n        Finally, yo·ur statement that we have refused to 1neet and confer is inaccurate,\nand you know it. Regardless of what you write, we bo1h know we have had multiple\nand sundry conversations with Michelin's counsel about production since May of\n2015. Moreover, recently at 1he deposition of Adrian Rico and his family in Dallas,\nwe conferred wi1h you specifically about the documents. You told us that nei1hcr you\nnor 'I'om had authority to malce decisio11s, and we needed to \"negotiate discovery'i with\nMichelin because that was their \"process.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0504\n\fSeptember 2, 2015\nPage2\n\n\n       We told you that Michelin does not make the Rules. It is not the Michelin's\nRules of Civil Procedure, We further told you that Plaintiffs follow the Texas Rules of\nCivil Procedure. The same stands true today. Accordingly, yet again, we ask that\nMichelin follow the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and its discovery scope and\nproduce the documents previously requested.\n\n\n\n                                               Very truly yours,\n\n\n\n\nLPG/DCS/tk\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   MR 0505\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 1 of 61\n\n\n\n\n                       IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                      FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF GEORGIA\n                                ATLANTA DIVISION\n\nJOHNNY BATES and PATRICIA\nMIDDLETON BATES,\n\nPlaintiffs,                                                         CIVIL ACTION NO.\n                                                                    1:09-C'V-3280-AT\nv.\nMICHELIN NORTH AMERICA, INC.,\n\nDefendant.\n\nI.

This is the Plaintiffs' second Motion for Sanctions\n\narising ont of Defendant Michelin North America lnc.'s (\"Michelin\") violation of\n\nthe Court's multiple Orders requiring the production of certain documents.'\n\nPlaintiffs request that the Court enter an Order establishing issue preclusion as a\n\ndiseovery sanction - specifically, a determination that the subject tire was\n\n\n\n1 Plaintiffs dicl not request that the Court impose sanctions against Micl1elin's counsel because\n\nin Plaintiffs' view the conduct giving rise to the sanctions request is part of a larger pattern of\ndiscovery abuse and disregard for the legal process by Michelin. Michelin was initially\nrepresented only by Robert Monyak, Bo11nic Lassiter and Benjamin Chastain of Peters and\nMony<lk, LLP.       On April 5, 2010, Elizabeth C. \"IZate\" Ilelm, of Nelson Mullins, Riley &\nScarborough, IJ.•P entered an appearance on behalf of Michelin. (See Doc. 27.) Ms. Helm is\nMicl1elin's national discovery counsel. As a result of her participation on 'behalf of Michelin in\ntl1e discovery process, Ms. I-Ielm ultimately became a material witness on the sartctions issue.\nThus, after Plaintiffs made their secortd request for sanctions, Richard I(. Hines of Nelson\nMullins, Riley & Scarborough, LLP and Susan A. Cahoort of I<ilpatrick Townsend & Stockton,\nI..I.,P-GA entered appearances on behalf of Michelin.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0507\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 3 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous and that the subject tire failed as a result\n\nof its defective and unreasonably dangerous condition.\n\n      Viewed in isolation, Michelin's failure to produce certain documents in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' discovery requests and this Court's Orders could be seen as\n\nlegitimate mistakes and misunderstandings.             However, Plaintiffs have\n\ndemonstrated that Michelin has engaged in a pattern of subterfuge and\n\nwithholding relevant and responsive documents until Plaintiffs are forced to seek\n\nthe Court's intervention. In light of this pattern of prejudicial discovery abuse by\n\nMichelin throughout the course of the litigation, the Court finds that Michelin\n\nacted willfully in violating the Court's discovery Orders.      Therefore, a more\n\nsubstantive sanction than the previous monetary sanction imposed by the Court\n\nis warranted.\n\n      Accordingly, after careful consideration of the evidence and the record of\n\nthis case, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART Plaintiffs'\n\nMotion for Sanctions as set forth below. Because the district court must clearly\n\nstate its reasons for imposing sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37\n\nto allow for meaningful appellate review, the Court provides a detailed discussion\n\nof the record as background and in its analysis.

Background of Previous Discovery Disputes\n\n        Plaintiffs brought this products liability and negligence action on\n\nNovember       23, 2009,    alleging a defect in a tire designed and manufactured by\n\nMichelin. 2     Plaintiffs served Michelin with their Requests for Production of\n\nDocmnents (\"RPDs\") on .January 15,             2010.    In addition to objecting to Plaintiffs'\n\nrequests as not being limited to the tire, plant, and time period relevant to this\n\naction, Michelin asserted a blanket objection that the requested docmnents\n\ncontained confidential trade secrets and were protected from disclosure.                           On\n\nApril   5, 2010,    the parties agreed upon a Stipulated Confidentiality Order to\n\ngovern the production and use of such documents which was entered by the\n\nCourt on April 7,      2010.    (See   Docs.   28, 29.)    Michelin produced documents on\n\nApril   23, 2010,   subject to the Stipulated Confidentiality Order. Michelin initially\n\nproduced a strikingly small number of documents in response to Plaintiffs'\n\ndiscovery requests.'         A dispute ensued between the parties over certain of\n\nPlaintiffs' RPDs, and Plaintiffs presented the dispute to the Court in the form of a\n\nletter-motion as instructed on November               HJ, 2010. (See      Pis.' Reply Ex. B, Doc.\n\n215-3.)\n\n\n\n-·-------\n2\n  This case was originally assigned to IIon. Richard Story after its initiation and \\Vas reassigned\nto the instant judge on Marcl1 7, 2011.\n1 At the time of the December 20, 2010 discovery hearing before the Court, Michelin had not\neven produced a full banker's box of documents, a fact which was admitted by Michelin's\ncounsel at the ,June 3, 2011 hearing on I)laintiffs' first request for sanctions.

(See Pis.' Ex.\n\nB, Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g, (June 7, 2010 \"Meet and Confer\" Tr. 6:8-20);\n\nDec. 20, 2011 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 5-11, Doc. 104; Pis.' Reply Ex. B (November 10, 2010\n\nLetter to .J. Story), Doc. 215-3.)\n\n         Plaintiffs sought an order compelling Michelin to produce documents\n\nresponsive to, inter alia, RPD 16 (specific documents listed by name), RPDs 25\n\nand 35 (design and production tolerances), RPD 37 (adjustment data), and RPD\n\n4   Michelin repeatedly asse1ted at the Septcrnber 19, 2011 sanctions hearing that Plaintiffs\nproposed the discovery time scope of 1998-2001 a11d that Michelin agreed to the scope as\nreasonable. Hov.;ever, Michelin's representation is misleading. Plaintiffs only ultimately agreed\nto limit the scope of their requests after Michelin ol)jected that the requests were not limited in\nscope to the tire, plant, and time period relevant to this action and refused to produce\ndocuments on those grounds. Further, Plaintiffs clearly did not agree to this limited time frame\nin connection -with all of their Requests for Production.\n5\n   Michelin began designing the P235/70R15 Uniroyal I...aredo AWR ORVVL tire in October 1995.\n'fhe P235/70R15 Uniroyal Laredo AVVR ORWL tire was manufactured solely at the Ard1nore\nPlant.

(See Pis.' Reply Ex. B (November 10,\n\n2010   Letter to J. Story), Doc.     215-3.)   The Court heard argument on the Plaintiffs'\n\nrequest on December          20, 2010,    and on .January      3, 2011,   the Court entered an\n\nOrder compelling Michelin to produce nearly aU of the documents sought by\n\nPlaintiffs.\n\n        A.      Plaintiffs' RPD 37 for Adjustment Data\n\n        Plaintiffs' RPD 37 (which was the subject of Plaintiffs' first request for\n\nsanctions and remains a subject of Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions) asks\n\nMichelin to:\n\n       Produce any documents containing, discussing or summarizing by\n       calendar year tire aqjustment or exchange data for the Uniroyal\n       Laredo series of tires, any tires with the same or similar\n       specifications as that series regardless of name or branding, or any\n       tire made from the same or similar \"green\" tire as that used in that\n       series for tires manufactured at the Ardmore, Oklahoma, [sic] facility\n       as compared to other manufacturing facilities of defendants.\n\nIn response to Plaintiffs' request for adjustment6 data, Michelin initially\n\nproduced a chart. summarizing by month (from 1998 to                 2001)   the number of tires\n\nproduced and the total number of tires returned for tread belt separation - the\n\nalleged condition at issue.7 Plaintiffs objected to the creation of the chart for\n\n\n6\n  \"Adjustment\" is the term Michelin uses to describe the process of issuing credits or payments\nto consumers or dealers \\Vhen its tires arc returned fOr alleged defects and failure.<;. Plaintiffs'\ndiscovery requests seek internal information pos.\".lessed by Michelin regarding how it \"adjusts\"\ncredits for tire.<> returned ±Or alleged defects and failures.\n7\n  Prior to production of the doGument\".l, the parties agreed, at least initially, to narrow the scope\nof the request to cover only the alleged defective conditio11 at issue in this case ~ tread belt\nseparation. At the discovery hearing, the Court recognized that a variety of adjustment codes\n\n\n                                                 5\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0511\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 7 of 61\n\n\n\n\npurposes of the litigation without the production of accompanying information\n\nthat was used to create the chart.             Plaintiffs argued to the Court that the\n\ninformation provided by Michelin was useless without the raw data, the codes,\n\nand the accompanying documents about how the data is collected, tabulated, and\n\nanalyzed. In addition, Plaintiffs requested that Michelin be compelled to produce\n\nthe internal manuals that Michelin uses for classifying the various types of\n\nmanufacturing and design conditions for which tires are returned. Plaintiffs also\n\nrequested documents used to interpret the adjustment data in order to determine\n\nwhether additional codes may cover the alleged tread belt separation condition at\n\nissue. (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 17-18, Doc. 104.)\n\n       The Court addressed Plaintiffs' request for these documents at the\n\nDecember 20, 2010 discovery hearing specifically as follows:\n\n       The Court: [M]y concern is if they are input by a code and there's no\n       other information other than entry of a code ... if [Michelin] would\n       provide the list of codes and what those codes represent so that if\n       [Plaintiffs] wanted to ask for additional codes to be checked, you\n       could do that, fearing that tread separation covers more than one\n       code and it may not have been covered, because what I understand is\n       if you push in ... the code for tread separation, it will tell you how\n       many there were, but it doesn't tell you specifics. It's just that this\n       tire, tl1is date, tread separation; but there's not a picture, there's not\n       an analysis beyond someone having categorized it as tread\n       separation.\n\n(Id. at 57-58.) On January 3, 2011, the Court ordered that\n\n\n1night potentially be relevant to the tread l)elt separation condition. (See Dec.   20i 2010   Disc.\nHr'g Tr. 57-58) Doc. 104.)\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0512\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 8 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      RPD 37: Defendant shall provide to Plaintiff the codes that are\n      used for identifying the causes for adjustment. As for any\n      adjustment identified in association with components and processes\n      at issue in this case, Defendant shall provide all data availahle to it\n      concerning that adjustment, including the date the tire was\n      returned, the age of the tire, the mileage, etc.\n\n(Doc. 90 at 5.) Accordingly, the Court ordered production of the documents as a\n\ntwo step process. First, Michelin was required to \"provide to Plaintiff[s] the\n\ncodes that are used for identifying the causes for adjustment,\" such that Plaintiffs\n\ncould identify which codes and conditions are potentially relevant to the alleged\n\ndefect at issue in this case. (Id.) Second, with respect to any adjustment codes\n\nidentified hy Plaintiffs as heing at issue, Michelin was required to \"provide all\n\ndata available to it concerning that adjustment, including the date the tire was\n\nreturned, the age of the tire, the mileage, etc.\" (Jd.)\n\n      B.     Michelin's Motion for Reconsideration Regarding\n             Adjustment Codes\n\n      Michelin sought reconsideration of the Court's January 3rd Order only so\n\nfar as it compelled production of adjustment code data in response to RPD 37\n\ncontending that the information contains trade secrets. Consequently, Michelin\n\ndid not produce the adjustment codes as ordered on January 3, 2011. On April\n\n28, 2011, the Court denied Michelin's motion for reconsideration on the gronnds\n\nthat (1) the trade secret issne was discussed and considered by the Court at the\n\nDecember 20th hearing and (2) Michelin offered no reason or change in law\n\nwarranting reconsideration of the Court's prior ruling compelling production of\n\n\n                                           7\n\n                                                                                 MR 0513\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 9 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthe adjustment data. (See Doc. 123.) In fact, at the December 20th hearing the\n\nCourt rejeded Michelin's trade secrets objection stating that documents could be\n\nproduced in accordance with the terms of the parties' Stipulated Confidentiality\n\nOrder and that counsel would be cxpeded to abide by the terms of that Order as\n\napproved and entered by the Court. (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 8:9-13, Doc.\n\n104.)\n\n        C.    Michelin's Failure to Produce Adjustment Codes and\n              Supporting Data\n\n        After its motion for reconsideration was denied on April 28, 2011, Michelin\n\nagain did not produce the adjustment data as ordered by the Court. Rather,\n\nMichelin informed Plaintiffs two weeks later, on May 12, 2011, that it no longer\n\nagreed that Plaintiffs' expert could receive or maintain copies of the documents,\n\nas contemplated by the Stipulated Confidentiality Order, due to Michelin's\n\nconcerns regarding the expert's protection of the confidential nature of the\n\ndocuments. Michelin unilaterally determined it could defer compliance with the\n\nCourt's Order requiring production of the documents after reconsideration was\n\ndenied and refused to produce the documents unless Plaintiffs agreed to modify\n\nthe terms of the Stipulated Confidentiality Order previously entered by the Court.\n\nOn May 13, 2011, Plaintiffs insisted that Michelin immediately comply with the\n\nCourt's Order compelling production of the documents and notified Michelin that\n\nthey would seek sanctions if the documents were not produced.\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\n\n                                                                                MR 0514\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 10 of 61\n\n\n\n\n        D.      Plaintiffs First Request for Sanctions\n\n        Plaintiffs made their request for sanctions on May 19,               2011,   after Michelin\n\nfailed to produce the adjustment codes and data under the current terms of the\n\nparties' Stipulated Confidentiality Order. Plaintiffs asked the Court to impose\n\nissue preclusion sanctions upon Michelin for its failure to produce the\n\nadjustment code data ordered by the Court.                     On May      20, 2011,     only after\n\nPlaintiffs made their request for sanctions, Michelin produced a list of conditions\n\nidentifying, by name only, the causes for adjustment, but not the numeric codes\n\nfor the adjustments. (Pis.' Reply Ex. E, Doc. 215-6.)\n\n               1.      .June 3,    2011   Hearing\n\n        The Court held a hearing on Plaintiffs' request for sanctions on ,Tune 3,\n\n2011.   At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for Michelin informed the Court\n\nthat the adjustment code data had been produced and that the parties had\n\nreached an agreement allowing Plaintiffs to provide the documents to their\n\nexpert. (June 3,      2011   Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 16:18-17:13, Doc. 169.) Based on these\n\ncircumstances, Michelin argued that Plaintiffs' continued request for sanctions at\n\nthe hearing was premature and improper without a \"meet and confer\" session. 8\n\n(Id. at 17:17-19:6.) Nonetheless, the Court proceeded with the hearing based on\n\n8 At the hearing and again in the June 24, 2011 ()rdcr, the (;ourt rejected this argument and\nfound tl1at M.icl1elin was obligated to comply with the Court's January 3, 2011 Order com1)elling\nthe production of the documents and that no \"1ncct and t.'Onfer\" '\\\\'US requirc'<l prior to Plaintiffs\nseeking sanctions for Michelin's failure to fully comply with the Court's prior orders.

The Conrt fonnd that this issne\n\nwas the eontinnation of the same discovery dispnte addressed in its Order of\n\nApril 28, 2011, and .Jndge Story's Order of Jannary 3, 2011.          (Jnne 3, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 19:7-14, Doe. 169.)\n\n      Michelin's connsel repeatedly represented that the list of adjnstment\n\nconditions produced to Plaintiffs was \"how the conditions are maintained in the\n\nregular course of business.\"     (Id. at 36:17-18, 37:6-8, 58:14-22.)      However,\n\nMichelin's counsel subsequently admitted in response to the Court's question at\n\nthe hearing that there were numbers that corresponded with the conditions and\n\nthat Michelin (not she) redacted the code numbers from the document produced\n\nto Plaintiffs. (Id. at 40:7-41:4.) In addition, in response to further inquiry by the\n\nCourt, Michelin's counsel revealed that additional documents describing t11e\n\nadjustment conditions existed. Michelin maintained that it was not ordered to\n\nproduce such documents and that the Court's January 3rd Order required only\n\nproduction of the codes. (Id. at 43:8-17, 59:1-10.)\n\n      The Court found that Michelin's redaction of the codes from the list of\n\nadjustment conditions violated the express terms as well as intent of the .January\n\n\n                                         10\n\n\n                                                                                  MR 0516\n\f       Case 1 09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 12 of 61\n\n\n\n\n3rd Order and that the list of adjustment conditions alone did not provide a\n\nsufficient documentary hasis or description from which Plaintiffs could identify\n\nall codes that might he relevant to the alleged tire defect in this case. (Id. at 52:8-\n\n55:1; 62:23-64:7.) Therefore, the Court ordered Michelin to produce the numeric\n\ncodes hy June 8, 2011, and all availahle documentary information descrihing the\n\nnature and causes for each adjustment code hy June 13, 2011. At the conclusion\n\nof the hearing, the Court warned Michelin that \"any further delays, manipulation\n\nof discovery ... or hasically failure to function in good faith in producing fully all\n\ninformation requested or ordered ... will result in a suhstantive sanction ...\n\ncomparahle to what Plaintiffs have asked the next time it comes in front of [the\n\nCourt].\" (Id. at 65:15-66:4.) The Court also cautioned Michelin's counsel ahout\n\nher client's hairsplitting, narrow constrnction of the Court's January 3, 2011\n\nOrder stating 'Tm not going to waste our time for us to go through another\n\nconference where you argue ahout ... what's really intended.\" (ld. at 54:15-25,\n\n63:20-64:7.)\n\n               2.   June 24,   2011   Order on Sanctions\n\n      On June 24, 2011, the Court issued a written Order on Plaintiffs first\n\nrequest for sanctions. (See Doc. 173.) The Court found sanctions were warranted\n\nhased on Michelin's failure to fully and timely comply with the Court's discovery\n\nOrders hut declined to impose issue preclusion sanctions. The Court instead\n\nawarded Plaintiffs attorney's fees incurred in connection with their request for\n\n\n                                          11\n\n\n\n                                                                                    MR 0517\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 13 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions and ordered Michelin to produce additional documents in response to\n\nPlaintiffs' discovery request for adjustment data. (Id.) The Court reiterated its\n\nfinding at the hearing that Michelin's extremely limited production \"essentially\n\nside-stepped by its narrow parsing and production response an essential purpose\n\nof the Court's original January 3,   2011,   discovery order regarding production of\n\nthe adjustment code data and information.\" (Id. at lo.) With respect to any\n\nadditional relevant adjustment codes identified by Plaintiffs, Michelin was\n\nordered to produce all tire data and documents available to it conceming those\n\nadjustment codes, including the internal manuals Michelin nses for classifying or\n\ndiscussing the conditions and issues arising in connection with application of a\n\nspecific adjustment code. (Id. at   ll.)   Finally, the Conrt again cautioned Michelin\n\nthat \"any failure to respond fully in producing these documents and tire data may\n\nresult in the imposition of sanctions, including the Court's entry of default,\n\ndetermination of issue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issne, or other\n\nsanctions authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A).\" (Id.)\n\nII.   Plaintiffs' Second Request for Sanctions\n\n      Just five days after the Court issued its written Order imposing sanctions,\n\nPlaintiffs made a second request for issue preclusion     sar1ctio11s 011 ~Tune   30,   2011,\n\nthat was supplemented in further submissions in connection with the Court's\n\n\n\n\n                                            12\n\n\n                                                                                          MR 0518\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 14 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions hearing condnctcd on September 19, 2011.9 (Docs. 180, 215, Hr'g Exs.\n\nA-X).     Plaintiffs' second sanctions reqnest is based on additional alleged\n\ndiscovery abuses by Michelin since the Court's June 3rd sanctions hearing.\n\nPlaintiffs seek the sanction of issue preclusion a' to the defectiveness of the tire\n\nbecause, at the time of their second sanctions request, Plaintiffs assert that: (1)\n\nMichelin had not produced all the adjustment codes as ordered by the Court on\n\nJune 3, 2011, and June 24, 2011, and, (2) Plaintiffs learned during the depositions\n\nof two Michelin employees that Michelin had withheld documents directly\n\nrelevant to the defect issue previously covered by the Court's Orders.\n\n        Plaintiffs corrtend that a finding that the tire at issue was defective is\n\nwarranted for several reasons. First, Michelin withheld numerous documents in\n\nviolation of Court Orders compelling their production. Second, Michelin made\n\nrepeated misrepresentations to the Court that all responsive documents had in\n\nfact been produced and thereby obstructed and altered the course of discovery.\n\nFinally, the Court's prior monetary sanction proved insufficient to ensure\n\ncompliance with the Court's Orders.\n\n        On the other hand, Michelin contends that Plaintiffs have fabricated a\n\ndiscovery dispute where none exists in order to avoid proving the merits of their\n\ncase. Michelin asse1ts that no responsive documents were withheld under its\n\n\n9\n The Court ordered that PlaintiftS' letter request for sanctions be filed as a formal motion on the\nCM/ECF system. (See Doc. 180.)\n\n\n                                                13\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0519\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 15 of 61\n\n\n\n\ninterpretation of Plaintiffs' discovery requests and the Court's Orders. To the\n\nextent any documents were withheld, Michelin contends it was the result of\n\nhuman error as opposed to any willful violation of the Court's Orders.           In\n\naddition, Michelin contends it never made any intentional misrepresentations to\n\nthe Court Finally, Michelin asserts that Plaintiffs have not heen prejudiced\n\nbecause it has now produced all the documents Plaintiffs requested, despite\n\nMichelin's belief that such production was not required, in a good faith effort to\n\nresolve a manufactured discovery dispute.\n\n      As Plaintiffs asserted in their second sanctions request, and more keenly\n\ndemonstrated at the second sanctions hearing and in response to Michelin's\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment, Michelin withheld nearly all probative\n\ndocuments for over one and a half years after Plaintiffs served their discovery\n\nrequests. These documents would likely never have emerged hut for Plaintiffs'\n\npersistene.c in seeking the Court's intervention. For the reasons set forth below,\n\nMichelin's serial abuses, misrepresentations, and willful violations of the Court's\n\ndiscovery Orders warrant substantive sanctions.\n\n      A.    Standard of Review\n\n      When a party fails to ohey a court order to provide discovery, the court is\n\nauthorized to sanction the party hy \"directing that the matters embraced in the\n\norder or other designated facts he taken as established for purposes of the action,\n\nas the prevailing party claims [or] prohibiting the disobedient party from\n\n\n                                        14\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0520\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 16 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsupporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing\n\ndesignated matters in evidence.\" See Fed.

September i.9,    2011 Sanctions     Hearing\n\n      On September 19, 2011, the Court conducted a full day evidenliary hearing\n\non Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions. Extensive argument was heard and\n\nthe parties submitted additional exhibits including hundreds of pages of\n\ndocuments produced hy Michelin after Plaintiffs filed their second sanctions\n\nrequest. Michelin's national discovery counsel Ms. Helm took the stand as the\n\nsole witness at the hearing to testify in Michelin's defense and to accept personal\n\nresponsibility for all of the alleged discovery \"errors.\"\n\n      C.      Michelin's Post-Sanctions Production of Adjustment Data\n\n     Plaintiffs contend that Michelin's continued failure to produce the\n\nadjustment codes and adjustment data in violation of the Court's January :ird,\n\nJune 3rd, and June 24th Orders warrants issue preclusion sanctions. After\n\nPlaintiffs' first request for sanctions, the Court ordered Michelin to produce three\n\nthings: (1) a list of the numeric adjustment codes that correlate to the list of\n\nadjustment conditions produced on May 20, 2011; (2) documents containing\n\n\n                                          16\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0522\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 18 of 61\n\n\n\n\nexplanations and photographs of the adjustment codes and conditions; and (3)\n\nfor each adjustment code identified hy Plaintiffs, all availahle tire adjustment\n\ndata and the internal manuals Michelin uses for classifying or discussing the\n\nconditions and issues arising in connection with application of the specific\n\nadjustment codes. (See Doe. 173.)\n\n      As ordered, Michelin produced a list of the numeric adjustment codes on\n\nJune 6, 2011. On June 13, 2011, Michelin produced 313 pages of adjustment\n\nconditions with codes, pictures and descriptions in purported compliance with\n\nthe Court's Order.    At that time, Michelin informed Plaintiffs it had fully\n\ncomplied with the Court's orders to produce all the codes. Upon review of these\n\ndocuments however, Plaintiffs discovered there were discrepancies between the\n\nMay 20th list of adjustment conditions, the June 6th list of conditions with\n\nnumeric codes, and the June 13th production of the conditions with codes,\n\npictures and descriptions. Accordingly, Plaintiffs contend that Michelin failed to\n\nproduce all the codes as ordered hy the Court on January 3rd, June 3rd, and\n\nagain on June 24th.\n\n    The Court held a status conference on ,July 7, 2011, to determine whether\n\nMichelin was in fact ohligated to produce additional documents identified hy\n\nPlaintiffs in their second sanctions request. At the July ]th status conference\n\nMichelin vehemently denied that it had not produced all the adjustment codes,\n\ndespite the fact that Plaintiffs detailed the discrepancies in the two prior\n\n\n                                        17\n\n\n                                                                               MR 0523\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 19 of 61\n\n\n\n\nproductions. (July 7, 2011 Status Conf. Tr. 27, Doc. 183.) However, on July 14,\n\n2011, Miehelin produced another 144 pages of adjustment conditions with codes,\n\npicttrres, and descriptions. 10\n\n     Plaintiffs assert that Michelin wrongfully withheld the adjustment codes in\n\nviolation of the Court's ,June 24th sanctions Order. In its defense, Michelin\n\neontends that the incomplete production was the result of human error. At the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing, Ms. Helm testified that after receiving the\n\nadjustment conditions with codes, pictures and descriptions from Michelin to be\n\nproduced on June 13, 2011, she compared them to the June 6th list of adjustment\n\ncodes and conditions and noticed that the two did not match. (Helm Aff.                ~   56,\n\nDoc. 192-6; Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12, Doc. 230.) There\n\nwere codes on the June 6th list for which Michelin did not have additional\n\ndescriptions, and there were additional descriptions of conditions that were not\n\nlisted on the ,June 6th code list. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12,\n\nDoc. 230.)\n\n     Ms. Helm testified that she made several mistakes on June 13, 2011. (Id.)\n\nFirst, Ms. Helm made mistakes regarding which adjustment codes were missing\n\nin her June 13th transmittal letter to Plaintiffs when the additional descriptions\n\n\n\n10 Out of the 144 pages produced by Michelin on July 14i 2011, 113 new conditions with codes,\npictures and descriptions were produced that 11ad previously been -withheld (MNA 8436-8548)\nand 31 were duplicates of conditions that were produced on June 13, 2011 (MNA 8560-8590).\n\n\n                                             18\n\n\n                                                                                           MR 0524\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 20 of 61\n\n\n\n\nwere produced.n (Helm Aff.           ~   58.) In her attempt to sort through the documents\n\nto compare them and determine the differences, Ms. Helm testified she\n\nsegregated out the documents for the conditions that were not on the June 6th\n\ncode list. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 171:21-175:12, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm\n\nfurther testified that when she compiled the documents to produce to Plaintiffs,\n\nthe documents for the conditions that were not on the June 6th list were\n\ninadvertently left out of the production. (Id.) According to Ms. Helm, she did not\n\ndiscover any of this until after Plaintiffs made their second request for sanctions.\n\n(ld.) Therefore, Michelin contends that it\" failure to produce all the codes as\n\nordered by the Court, the result of human error, amounts to excusable neglect\n\nthat does not warrant the imposition of the severe sanction requested by\n\nPlaintiffs. However, Plaintiffu contend that Michelin continued to produce the\n\nadjustment data documents in bad faith after the Court's June 3rd sanctions\n\nhearing.\n\n     At the September 19th hearing, Michelin requested that it not be sanctioned\n\nfor any misconduct, essentially asserting that it should be rewarded for counsel's\n\nself-corrective actions. In response to Plaintiffs' contention that Michelin failed\n\nto produce au the adjustment conditions with codes, descriptions, and pictures in\n\nbad faith, Michelin's counsel claimed that \"the only reason they knew of those\n\n\n11\n   Ms. Helm admitted these mista}{es during the July ?tl1 status conference, l)ut had not yet\ndiscovered her failure to produce all the codes as outlined in her July 14, 2011 lcttcr to Plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                                 19\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0525\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 21of61\n\n\n\n\nmissing items was that there was a self reporting.\"        (Id. at 89.)     Michelin\n\ncontended that the additional 144 pages were produced on its own initiative and\n\nnot becanse Plaintiffs had caught Michelin red-handed. (Id. at 145.) However,\n\nMichelin's alleged \"self reporting\" did not occnr until after Plaintiffs pointed ont\n\nthere were missing codes and sought sanctions for Michelin's withholding of the\n\ndocnments. Michelin did not simply discover the error on its own and voluntarily\n\ncome forward with the documents as it would have the Court believe. While this\n\nconduct alone would not warrant issue preclusion sanctions, the Court is\n\ndoubtful of whether Michelin would have discovered this oversight and\n\nvoluntarily produced the additional 113 adjustment codes that had previously\n\nbeen withheld in the absence of Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions.\n\n             1.    Michelin's multiple misrepresentations regarding\n                   adjustment codes aud conditions\n\n     Unfortunately, the veracity of Michelin's contentions regarding its conduct\n\nin the discovery process for a variety of reasons has proven unreliable. It appears\n\nPlaintiffs are correct in their assertion that every one of Michelin's counsel's\n\nrepresentations to the Court regarding the production of the adjustment codes\n\nand adjustment data has proven to be inaccurate.\n\n      First, as noted above, Ms. Helm told the Court at the June 3rd hearing that\n\nthe six-page list of adjustment conditions \"are the codes\" and that these are the\n\nway the codes are maintained \"in the regular course of business.\" (June 3,     2011\n\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\n\n                                                                                 MR 0526\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 22 of 61\n\n\n\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 36:11-19, Doc. 169.)               However, when pressed, Ms. Helm\n\neventually admitted that the numeric codes had been redacted from this list but\n\nthat \"I didn't do it, Yonr Honor.\"u (Id. at 40:24-41'4.) She fnrther stated that\n\n\"[b]nt there's been no condition of a tire redacted from this list.\" (Id.) Then,\n\nmuch to the Court's surprise, at the September 19th Sanctions hearing, Ms. Helm\n\ndenied that Michelin redacted the codes and instead took personal responsibility\n\nfor the redactions' oeenrrenee.'3 (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 191:17-196:7,\n\nDoe. 230.) Ms. Helm was evasive in response to Plaintiffs' qnestioning of who\n\nredacted the list, stating repeatedly that she did not recall. (Id.) When asked\n\nwho provided her with the docnment that had been redacted, Ms. Helm again\n\ntestified she did not recall. (Id.) Ms. Helm fnrther testified at the September\n\n19th sanctions hearing that when she told the Conrt on ,June 3rd that the list\n\ncontained the adjustment codes as regnlarly maintained by Michelin, she in fact\n\nknew the codes had been ent off the side of the document. (Id.)\n\n       Ms. Helm admitted that \"we should have produced the codes with the\n\nnumbers.\" (Id.) When asked where was the mistake or human error in the\n\nredaction of the codes, Ms. Helm testified \"the mistake and human error was\n\n\n12 Michelin's redaction of the codes \\Vas 1he subject of the Court's June 24tlt Order on sanctions\nand does not form the basis for the Court'8 imposition of sanctio11s herein. IIowever, the\nredaction is relevant to the larger pattern of Michelin's abuse of the discovery process as further\ndcn1onstratcd by Michelin's counsel's subsequent evasive testimony regarding who actually\nmade the decision to redact the codes.\n13\n   It is clear tl1at Ms. Helm attem1)ted to take the blame for the redaction in order to protect\nMichelin from further sanctions.\n\n\n                                                21\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0527\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 23 of 61\n\n\n\n\nmaking the decision to redact the numbers off or to produce the document with\n\nthe numhers redacted off.\" (Id.) After repeated questions by Plaintiffs as to who\n\nmade that decision, Ms. Hehn stated she made the decision despite her previous\n\nrepresentation to the Court on June 3, that \"I didn't do it.\"'< (Id.) When asked\n\nwhether she spoke with anyone at Michelin about the decision, Ms. Helm further\n\nevaded the issue by responding she did not recall. (Id.)\n\n      In addition, Michelin's June 13th production of the conditions with codes,\n\npictures and descriptions revealed the falsity of its representations to the Court at\n\nthe June 3rd hearing that the redacted six-page list of adjustment conditions\n\nwere the codes and that this skeletal listing constituted the way the codes are kept\n\nin the regular course of business. Ms. Helm subsequently confirmed that the full\n\nproduction - including the codes, pictures and verbal descriptions of how to\n\nidentify the tire conditions represented by each code             are \"the documents used\n\nby the inspectors in the adjustment centers to evaluate and code returned tires.\"\n\n(Helm Aff.   ~   55, Doe. 192-6.)\n\n     Furthermore, Michelin's counsel represented to the Court at the June 3rd\n\nhearing that while the numeric codes may have been redacted, no adjustment\n\nconditions were redacted from the May 20th list of adjustment: conditions. (June\n\n3, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 40:24-41'4, Doc. 169.) This representation turned out\n\n\n14\n   Before taldng responsibility for the decisio11, Helrn attempted to assert the attorney-client\nprivilege. (Sept. 19, 2011Sanctions1-Ir'g 'fr. 195, Doc. 230.)\n\n\n                                              22\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0528\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 24 of 61\n\n\n\n\nto be only partially true. While certain conditions may not have been redacted\n\nfrom the list, Michelin now admits that 113 adjustment conditions were not\n\nincluded on the original list. (Helm Aff. iii! 56-59, Doc. 192-6; Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 171-176, Doc. 230.)\n\n    Although the Court originally believed Ms. Helm's affidavit testimony that\n\nthe failure to produce the missing adjustment codes was an innocent oversight,\n\nand while this may very well be true, tbc credibility of her statements over time\n\nhas been eroded by the actual course of discovery events. In light of Ms. Helm's\n\nevasive and inconsistent testimony at the September 19th hearing and Defendant\n\nMichelin's shifting representations made to the Court since ,June 3, 2011, the\n\nCourt cannot simply rely on Michelin's avowals of good faith regarding any of\n\nthese discovery issues.\n\n            2.     Michelin's failure to produce graphs and other\n                   interpretive adjustment data\n\n      In accordance with tbe Comt's two-step process for the production of the\n\nadjustment data, after Michelin produced all the codes that are used for\n\nidentifying the causes for adjustment and Plaintifts identified the additional\n\ncodes for which they sought adjustment data, Michelin was required to provide\n\nall data available to it concerning the identified aqjustment codes. (Doc. 90 at 5;\n\nDoc. 173 at n.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\n                                                                                MR 0529\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 25 of 61\n\n\n\n\n        On July 19, 2011, Michelin produced a large chart of indecipherable\n\nadjustment data along with a glossary created for the litigation. After Plaintiffs\n\nwere unable to make any sense of the information, they questioned Michelin's\n\nemployee-expert Mr. Charles Patrick, who regularly reviewed adjustment data,\n\nabout the chart. (Patrick Dep. 76-90, July 28, 2011.) Mr. Patrick testified he had\n\nnever seen the information in that format. (Id. at 76.) Mr. Patrick was unable to\n\ninterpret the chart during his deposition. (Id. at 84-90.) Indeed, Michelin's own\n\nemployee could not decipher the chart using the glossary created by Michelin to\n\ndecode the chart. (Id. at 90-95.)\n\n        The chart appears to contain information about the number of tires\n\nreturned under the relevant aqjustment codes identified by Michelin. At the\n\nSeptember 19, 2011 sanctions hearing, Plaintiffs maintained that Michelin was\n\nstill continuing to withhold internal documents necessary to analyze and explain\n\nthe data in the chart. Like the original list of adjustment conditions provided, the\n\nchart was a meaningless listing in and by itself, as demonstrated by Mr. Patrick's\n\ndeposition testimony. >s\n\n\n- - ----·----\n1\n ~ The chart does however highlight the importance for the numeric adjust1nent codes that were\noriginally redacted by Michelin. '.rhc chart references the numeric adjustment code only and not\nthe name of any of the conditio1is for which the tires were returned. Tl1e Court notes that at the\nJune 3rd hearing regarding production of the adjustment codes Michelin's Counsel stated\n\"what is important is not whetl1er we call it n11ml)er :t, it's \\vhether we cal1 it unsticldng or\nleaking at the joint.\" (,June,;, 2011 Sanctio11s Hr'g '.I'l'. 4:1:5-10, Doc. 169.) Yet, it is clear, that\nwithout the numeric codes, the subsequently prod11ced chart purportedly summarizing the\nadjustment data would have been even more incompreltensible.\n\n\n                                                  24\n\n                                                                                                      MR 0530\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 26 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      The ,July 19th chart of adjustment data does uot comply with the Court's\n\nJune 24th Order. The June 24th Order provided that:\n\n      With respect to each adjustment code identified by Plaiutiffs,\n      Micheliu shall provide to Plaintiffs all tire data aud documents\n      available to it couceruiug that adjustmeut. To eusure full compliauce\n      with this directive, the Court uotes that Micheliu should produce the\n      internal manuals it uses for classifyiug or discussiug the couditious\n      aud issues arisiug iu couuectiou with applicatiou of the specific\n      adjustment code.\n\n(Doc. 173 at 11.) Moreover, the Court warned Michelin tl1at \"any failure to\n\nrespond fully in producing these documents and tire data may result in the\n\nimposition of sanctions, including the Court's entry of default, determination of\n\nissue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issue, or other sanctions authorized\n\nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(A).\" (Td.)\n\n      An essential purpose of the Order was to ensure that Plaintiffs were\n\nprovided the information necessary to analyze and evaluate the adjustment data\n\nto determine how many tires were being returned for the conditious at issue in\n\nthis case. Not only did Michelin produce the adjustment data in a format that\n\nwas indecipherable to Plaintiffs, not even a Michelin employee who was\n\nexperienced in analyzing adjustment data could understand the information\n\nprovided in the chart. Indeed, as Mr. Patrick admitted in his deposition, in order\n\nto understand the meaning of eve1y column and code in tl1e chart, he would need\n\nmore than just the glossary prepared by Michelin. (Patrick Dep. 95, July 28,\n\n2011.) In light of the Court's prior directives with respect to the adjustment codes\n\n\n                                         25\n\n                                                                                 MR 0531\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 27 of 61\n\n\n\n\nand data, Michelin's production of the adjustment data in this completely\n\nunusable format was patently unacceptable. Michelin's mode of production of\n\nthe chart is yet one more strand in its pattern of failing to produce meaningful\n\nresponses to Plaintiffs' discovery requests in violation of both the letter and spirit\n\nof the Court's Orders.\n\n      According to Mr. Patrick, Michelin itself actually did not nse the chart form\n\nthat was produced to Plaintiffs in this litigation bnt instead compiled its tire\n\nadjustment and retnrn data into graphs for comparison and analysis at quarterly\n\nmeetings. (Id. at 76.) As Mr. Patrick testified, these graphs compared the return\n\nrates of Laredo tires to other tire lines and to Michelin's overall rates. (fd. at 76,\n\n79, 112, 182-83.) No snch graphs were produced by Michelin in response to RPD\n\n37 requesting information summarizing Michelin's adjustment data.\n\n      At the sanctions hearing, Michelin contended that it did not keep these\n\ngraphs and that they were destroyed after their nse at these quarterly meetings.\n\nMs. Helm testified at the hearing that after Mr. Patrick's deposition, Michelin\n\nsearched for the graphs and determined that no snch graphs exist. (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 18s-86, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm further testified that the graphs\n\nwere created as demonstratives for the employee meetings and are not\n\nmaintained after the staff meetings. (Id. at 241.)\n\n      These graphs wonld obviously be highly probative of the issne of what\n\nMichelin knew ahont its tires' comparative failure rates, why certain tires were\n\n\n                                         26\n\n                                                                                   MR 0532\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 28 of 61\n\n\n\n\nfailing, and what changes in the design or manufacturing process may have been\n\ninitiated to prevent future failures.     As Mr. Patrick testified, by using this\n\ninformation Michelin could determine whether it was \"starting to see something\n\nnew when we put in high-tensile steel, I mean, are the tires lasting longer, does it\n\nlook like the wear rates are lasting longer, things like that.\" (Patrick Dep. 80,\n\n,July 28, 2011.) And indeed, Mr. Patrick as Michelin's key design representative\n\ntestified tliat this data was supposedly an essential tool used by Michelin's staff in\n\nguiding its tire design and quality assurance work on an ongoing basis. (Id.)\n\nFurthermore, this testimony serves as the basis for Michelin's summary\n\njudgment motion asserting that Michelin cannot be found to have engaged in the\n\nnecessary bad faith to warrant the imposition of punitive daniages because it\n\nemployed design and manufacturing quality assurance proc.edures. (See Doc.\n\n205.)\n\n    The adjustment data would be extremely relevant to Plaintiffs' ability to\n\nestablish whether Michelin knew of identified defects in its tires based on the\n\nreturn information through the warranty process. As Mr. Patrick confirmed, the\n\nadjustment data could be analyzed to determine whether tires were being\n\nreturned for conditions resulting from a manufacturing versus a design issue.\n\n(Id. at 100-105.) Accordingly, at the conclusion of the September 19th sanctions\n\nhearing, the Court ordered Michelin to provide further clarification of the chart's\n\ndata and mode of inforniation presentation.        Until the Court's Order at the\n\n\n                                         27\n\n                                                                                   MR 0533\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 29 of 61\n\n\n\n\nconclnsion of the September 19,        2011   sanctions hearing, Michelin delayed in\n\nproducing information essential to assessing the comparative data it finally\n\nproduced in the chart it provided to Plaintiffs on July 19,       2011,   thus seriously\n\nimpeding Plaintiffs' preparation of their case.\n\n     By withholding the information necessary to understand the adjustment\n\ndata in the chart, Michelin effectively attempted to prevent Plaintiffa from using\n\nthe adjustment data to establish whether the tire at issue was being returned for\n\ncertain manufacturing or design conditions, whether Michelin was aware of these\n\nconditions in the tire, and whether Michelin made any changes to the tire as a\n\nresult of a high return rate. Moreover, the \"special\" chart that Michelin has now\n\nprovided is clearly not a full substitute for producing the actual graphs or graph\n\ndata that Michelin's staff used to review and assess comparative return aud\n\nfailure rates of its various tire lines. Given the centrality of this data to Michelin's\n\ndesign and quality assurance processes - processes that Michelin seeks to use as\n\na lynchpin of its product liability defense in this case - the Court is skeptical that\n\nMichelin would not maintain such documents and data.\n\nD.    Michelin's Misrepresentations Abont Reaction Limits and\n      Prodnction Tolerances and the Failnre to Prodnce Those\n      Docnments\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that Michelin also made misrepresentations to the Court\n\nregarding reaction limits and production tolerance documents so as to persuade\n\nJudge Story to limit his .January 3,   2011   Order based on a false factual predicate.\n\n\n                                          28\n\n                                                                                     MR 0534\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 30 of 61\n\n\n\n\nThey also maintain that Michelin failed to fully prodnce all available relevant\n\ndocuments responsive to the three Requests for Production covering these\n\ndocuments.\n\n       The documents at issue here were initially the subject of the discovery\n\ndispute that led to the December         20, 2010    discovery hearing and the .January 3,\n\n2011   Order compelling production of documents. Plaintiffs requested \"reaction\n\nlimits\" documents in RPD 16, \"design and production tolerances\" in RPD 25, and\n\n\"tolerances for plies and belt materials\" in RPD 35.' 6 Reaction limits and\n\ntolerances are used by tire builders ·during the manufacturing process to\n\ndetermine whether the tires comply with their design specifications.

On the other hand, \"product variation outside of the\n\ntolerance limits is non-confirming; this product must be tagged and placed in the\n\nnon-conforming area.

Hr'g Tr. 38-39,\n\n42-43, Doc. 104.)       In response, the Court inquired: \"If you gave the reaction\n\nlimits and the decision trees, that would cover those tolerances.\" 22 (Id. at 42:22-\n\n23.) Ms. Helm responded: \"That would [cover] the manufacturing tolerances\n\nbecause that's really what they are, Your Honor. So I believe that's duplicative of\n\nthe earlier discussion.\" (Id. at 42:24-43:1.)\n\n       Based on Michelin's representations that the reaction and tolerance limits\n\ndocuments had in fact been produced, the Court did not order any further\n\n\n\n\n21\n   Michelin counsel advised the (;ourt, \"We've produced the entire design file ... We've produced\nthe specifications which show ho\\v the tire is to be manufactured and the measurements and the\ncomponents and. all of that.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g 'l'r. 42:15-21, Doc. 104.)\n22\n   According to Ms. Helm, decision trees (or aspect specifications) are the criteria used by tire\nbuilders to test tl1e production quality for cured tires whereas reactio11 limits (used\ninterchangeably by Helm with tolerances) are the criteria used by tire 'builders to test the\nproduction quality for uncured tires.

Specifically,\n\nthe Order stated as follows:\n\n      RPD 16: Defendant shall produce documents responsive to (b)\n      [Decision Tree Documents] and (c) [Asset Specifications documents]\n      that were in effect during the agreed upon time frame and which\n      relate to processes at issue: trapped air, placement of steel belts,\n      molding issues, and adhesion issues. Should other components and\n      processes be identified in the future by Plaintiffs, Defendant shall be\n      required to produce documents related to those components and\n      processes as well. The Court finds that the information sought in\n      [(d) Reaction Limits Documents] has been provided by Defendant in\n      the development files already produced. Therefore no further\n      production is required.\n\n      RPDs 25 and 35: The documents requested [tolerances] are\n      covered by the Court's rulings as to RPD 16.\n\n(Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\n      On July 28, 2011, Michelin's former employee tire-design expert, Mr.\n\nPatrick was deposed and testified that he had reviewed the development file\n\nproduced by Michelin and it did not in fact contain the reaction limits or\n\ntolerances as had been represented to the Court at the December 20th hearing.\n\n(Patrick Dep. 64-65, July 28, 2011.) Nine days earlier, on July 19, 2011, in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' second request for sanctions for withholding documents\n\nresponsive to RPD 50 (documents discussing specific tire defects), Michelin for\n\nthe first time produced documents (MNA 8779, MNA 9634-9658) that defined\n\nthe notable difference between tolerances and reaction limits and made clear that\n\nPlaintiffs' requests for tolerance and reaction limit data and documents would\n\n\n\n                                        32\n\n                                                                                MR 0538\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112         Page 34 of 61\n\n\n\n\nnot be duplicative. Until that time, Plaintiffs had accepted the accuracy of the\n\nrepresentations of Michelin's counsel to the Comt at the December 20th hearing.\n\nHowever, these new internal Michelin documents revealed that Michelin's\n\nrepresentations to the Conrt at the December 20th conference were inaccurate\n\nand had effectively restricted discovery of substantive information bearing on\n\nMichelin's tire design and manufacturing process.\n\n      The Court recognizes that the reaction and tolerance limit tire\n\nmanufacturing terms - however significant for this case - are terms of art that\n\nMichelin counsel might have confused at the Deeember 20, 2010, hearing, as Ms.\n\nHelm maintained in her testimony at the September 19, 2011 hearing. (Sept. 19,\n\n2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 161:4-6, Doc. 230.). However, Ms. Helm testified at the\n\nSeptember 19th hearing that immediately npon reviewing the Court's .January 3,\n\n2010 discovery Order, she realized the Conrt \"pnt reaction limits in the\n\ndevelopment file\" and that she knew that was not correct.             (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 161-62, Doc. 230.) Most significantly, in response to the\n\nCourt's inquiry at the September 19th hearing Ms. Helm testified that in .January\n\n2011 or thereafter she did not advise the Court that the Order was incorrect\n\nbecause of her earlier erroneous representation to the Court nor did she go back\n\nand clarify the issne for the Plaintiffs - despite Michelin's later filing a motion for\n\nreconsideration of the ruling on RPD 37 (with respect to the adjustment data).\n\n(Id. at 161-62). Ratl1er, Ms. Helm testified that she simply eonfirmed for herself\n\n\n                                          33\n\n\n                                                                                    MR 0539\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 35 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthat no such reaction limit documents were still available from the 1998-2001\n\ntimeframe (because that was the time scope which the Court had applied to the\n\nproduction under RPD 16 after being advised the reaction limit data and\n\ndocument' would be included in the development file produced). 2 s\n\n        While Ms. Helm may not have originally on December 20, 2010,\n\nintentionally misled the Court, her subsequent failure to correct the mistake once\n\nshe realized the Court relied on her statements to conclude that the documents\n\nhad been produced in the development file is plainly unacceptable. As of the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing, more than eight months after Michelin's\n\ncounsel's review of Judge Story's Order of January 3, 2011, Michelin had not\n\nproduced the reaction limits or tolerances despite its realization that it had\n\nrepresented to the Court that those documents had previously been produced.\n\nMichelin effectively kept the Plaintiffs and the Comt in the dark by allowing them\n\nto rely on inaccurate information, which Michelin knew to be false upon its\n\nreceipt of the January 3rd Order. In essence, Michelin thereby precluded the\n\nPlaintiffs from asking the Court to reconsider its application of a restricted time\n\nscope for these specific production requests. 2 4\n\n\n23 According to Ms. Hehn's testimony at tl1e September 19th hearing, Michelin did not produce\nthe reaction limits for an uncured (\"green\") P235/7oll15 lJniroyal l,aredo AWR ORWL tire\nbecause these documents for the 1998-2001 timeframc were outside their document retention\nperiod and were not captured by any prior litigation hold. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g ·rr.\n93:15-17; 99:2-10, Doc. 230.)\n21\n ' Plairttiffs had argue(l for an unli1nited time scope to apply to these specific document requests\n(RPD 16). I-Iowevcr, the ,January 3rd Order provided a limited time scope to Rl)D 16, but 11ot to\n\n\n                                                34\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0540\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 36 of 61\n\n\n\n\n       Indeed, Michelin was aware that, although reaction limits no longer existed\n\nfor the parties' agreed scope, documents concerning reaction limits for other tires\n\nmanufactured at the Ardmore plant post-2001 existed that had been caught by a\n\nprior litigation hold and were produced in other cases. (Id. at 228:18-229:10.)\n\nWhile Michelin disputes the relevance of these documents, the Plaintiffs have\n\npersuasively argued that they are directly relevant to their proof of Michelin's\n\ndefective manufacturing and inspection process. (Id. at 255-257.) In any event,\n\nuntil these issues came to light in ,July 2011 after t11e Court's Orders, Michelin\n\nneither clarified the record nor made responsive documents available. Yet, at the\n\nDecember 20, 2010 discovery hearing, Michelin's counsel assured the Court that\n\nshe was not seeking lo limit the production of the tire manufach1ring and\n\ninspection process docmnents \"so narrow that it ends up I produce zero . . .\n\nThese documents exist and I know they exist.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Hr'g Tr. 35-36.)\n\nMoreover, Mr. Patrick's testimony confirmed that reaction limits and tolerances\n\narc not tire specific, but relate to the particular processes used at the individual\n\nplants and therefore these documents should not have been subject to the 1998-\n\n2001 temporal scope. (Patrick Dep. 25-26.) For tl1e foregoing reasons, the Court\n\nfinds Michelin improperly manipulated the course of discovery and the Court's\n\n\n\nn1ultiple others requested by Michelin. As discussed below, the Court li1nited the production\nrcS]_Jonsive to RPD 16 in an cffo1t to address Michelin's concern<;; regarding disclosure of\nconfidential trade secrets and a potentially over-inclusive docurnent production in light of the\nevolution of tl1e tire design and manufacturing process.\n\n\n                                              35\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0541\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 37 of 61\n\n\n\n\nreview of the discovery disputes at issue in the December 20, 2010 discovery\n\nhearing and the Court's Order of January 3, 2011.\n\n       After learning that Michelin had produced reaction limits in other cases at\n\nthe September 19th sanctions hearing, Plaintiffs requested that the Court order\n\nMichelin to produce these documents. On September 23, 2011, the court ordered\n\nMichelin to produce the reaction limits documents identified although they fell\n\noutside the 1998-2001 time scope. Michelin produced the documents as ordered\n\non September 28, 2011. 'S Plaintif!S assert in their response to Michelin's motion\n\nfor partial summary judgment that it became clear after Michelin produced the\n\ndocuments why it fought production for so long. According to Plaintiffs, the\n\nsubject tire failed to meet the tolerance limits and should have been scrapped.\n\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs persuasively argued that these documents would go\n\ndirectly to the defect issue.          Michelin would never have produced these\n\ndocuments to Plaintiffs in this case without the Court's intervention. Without\n\nthese documents, Plaintiffs' ability to prove a defect in the tire would be\n\nhampered and the delayed production resulted in prejudice to Plaintiffs as\n\ndiscussed more fully below.\n\n\n\n\n25\n   Indeed, Michelin voluntarily 1)roduced 700 pages of docurnents it deemed nonresponsive to\nPlaintiffs' discovery requesb:; after receiving Plaintiffs' second sanctions request but did not\nproduce the reaction 1i1nits until ordered to do so by the Court after the September 19th\nsanctions hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0542\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 38 of 61\n\n\n\n\nE.      Michelin's Failnrc to Prodnce Certain Docmnents in Response to\n        RPD50\n\n        A substantial part of Plaintiffs' second sanctions request centers around\n\nMichelin's alleged failure to produce documents in response to Plaintiffs' RPD\n\n50.' 6 RPD 50 identified several defects that Plaintiffs believed existed in the\n\nsubject tire and asked for documents discussing how design and manufacturing\n\nproblems or deficiencies can result in those defects in tires generally. Michelin\n\ninitially objected to RPD 50 on the basis that it was not limited in scope to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action and refused to produce\n\ndocuments on those grounds. Plaintiffs opposed these limitations because RPD\n\n50 was not crafted to be tire or plant specific.\n\n        Consequently, the parties addressed t11e scope of RPD 50 with the Court at\n\nthe December 20th discovery hearing. Plaintiffs' counsel expressly argued that\n\nRPD 50 should not be limited to the 1998-2001 timeframe because RPD 50 is\n\nbroader in scope than the tire at issue.'7 (See Dee. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 23:24-\n\n\n26\n    RPD 50 provides as follows \"Please i)roduce any docnn1ents which discuss how desig11 or\nmanufacturing problems or deficiencieB can result ir1 the folloV1ing conditions: a) air pocl<:ets; b)\noxidation; c) internal belts not lined u1); d) spread.ing in internal beltr-;; e) tire overshaped in\nmold; f) brassy Vl:'ires with poor adhesion to belts and rubber; and g) reversion.\"\n27\n   Michelin's assertion that its interpretation of the Court's Order on RPD 50 as being su~ject to\nt11e 1998-2001 temporal scope applied to RPD 16 \"given tl1at plaintiffs' coun.sel had riot clearly\nstated anything to the contra1y\" at the December 20 hearing is ·flatly contrary to the hearing\ntranscript. (See Dec. 20i 2010 Disc. Jir'g Tr. 24:20-25:18, Doc. 104.) Michelin's contention that\nits interpretation of RJ)D 50 and the Court's Janua1y :3rd Order was also based on statements by\nPlaintiffs' counsel that there was no longer a dispute regarding the agreed scope is likewise\nspurious. In their November lOi 2010 letter-motion to the Court, Plaintiffs asserted that\nMichelin narrowed its production of docume11ts to one year before and one year after the date\nthe subject tire was manufactured despite the parties' negotiatior1 of an agreed scope of 1998-\n\n\n                                                 37\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0543\n\f           Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 39 of 61\n\n\n\n\n25:11, Doc. 104.) Indeed, the Conrt recognized that not all of Plaintiffs' requests\n\nwere tire specific requests and that it was clear that some of Plaintiffs' requests\n\nsought information \"generally on the part of Michelin as opposed to how it may\n\nspecifically relate to a given tire.\" (Id. at 10:8-13.) Michelin's counsel did not\n\nprovide any response in support of limiting the scope of RPD 50. 28 While\n\nPlaintiffs were ultimately interested in whether certain design and manufacturing\n\ndeficiencies resulted in the defects in the Bates tire, it is dear from the language\n\nof the request itself and Plaintiffs' counsel's statements at the December 20th\n\n\n2001. As a result, Plaintiffs requested that tl1e Court order Michelin to expand its production to\nthe   S(~opc   as originally agreed of 1998-2001 for specific requests. In its December 16, 2010\nresponse to the Court, counsel for Michelin acknovvle<lged that not all docurn.ents covered by the\nagreed scope had beer1 produced and represented that Michelin had supplernented its response\nand produced all documents subject to the agreed scope. Based on this response, Plaintiffs\ninformed the Court at the December 20th hearing that the parties had resolved tl1is issue vvith\nthe agreed scope ±Or specific RPDs and it 11eed not be addressed by the Court. Michelin's\nreliance on this statement by Ms. May addressing \\Vhich years were covered by the agreed scope\nas support for its assertion that RPD 50 was su~ject to the 1998-2001 agreed time scope is\nmLsplaced. As discussed infra, Plaintiffs' counsel also continued to argue for an unlhnited time\nand plant scope for other specific RPDs, including RPD 50.\n28\n   On the other hand, Michelin opposed Plaintiffs' argument that ItrD 16 should 11ot be limited\nto documents in effect at the time the subject tire was manufactured because Plaintiffs sought to\nidentify what Michelin lmew about J)roblems vvith its tires and its manufacturing processes\nbefore the time the subject tire was specifically manufactured. (Id. at 6:7-11.) Based on an\nAffidavit from a Michelin employee detailing the evolving design and manufacturing process for\nMichelin tires, the Court expressed concern that if RPD 16 (which called for documents subject\nto protection as trade secrets) were not limited to some extent, it would require the production\nof a voluminous amount of docwncnts concerning unrelated tires and unrelated components\nand processes at issue. (Id. at 7:19-5.) The parties ultimately agreed at the hearing to limit the\nscope of RPD 16 to passenger tires. Micl1elin requested that the Court liinit its production of\ndocuments in response to RPI) 16 to the components and processes at issue and (although not\nlimited to the subject tire itse1D to the docn1nents that were in use at the time the subject tire\nwas made (rather t11an the agreed four year scope). (Id. at 33-35.) With the assurance that a\nco1nplete development file had been produced, the Court entered its January 3rd Order with\nrespect to RPI) 16 requiring Mic.helin to \"produce docmnents . , . that were in effect during the\nagreed upon time frame and which relale to the processes at issue: trapped aiI\\ placement of\nsteel belts, rnolding issues, and adhesiorl issues.\" (Doc. 90 at 4.)\n\n\n                                                38\n\n\n                                                                                               MR 0544\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 40 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndiscoveiy hearing that RPD 50 was crafted to reach Michelin's knowledge about\n\ntire defects in general.        Although the Court expressly applied the temporal\n\nlimitation requested by Michelin to other RPDs (i.e., 16, 47 & 48) in the January\n\n3rd Order, the Court delineated no temporal limit for the scope of RPD 50 and\n\nordered Michelin to \"produce the requested documents for the components and\n\nprocesses at issue.\" (Doc. 90 at 5.)\n\n       According to Plaintiffs, Michelin produced very few documents following\n\nthe Court's January 3rd Order. In fact, Michelin confirmed at the September\n\n19th sanctions hearing that the only documents initially produced in response to\n\nRPD 50 were the aspect specifications and decision trees (terms used\n\ninterchangeably) that were specifically identified by Plaintiffs in RPD 16. 2 0 (Sept.\n\n19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 98:19-23; 156:21-157:19, Doc. 230.) At the December\n\n20, 2010 discovery hearing, Ms. Helm represented to the Court that Michelin was\n\nnot trying to limit the scope of the requests so narrowly so as to end np having to\n\n\n\n\n29\n    Michelin limited its rcspon.-;e to RPD 50 to these <locurnents because of its admitted\n\"interpretation\" of RPD 50 as asldng for the same documents as HJlD 16. Michelin's\ninterpretation is unreasonable for a number of reasons. First, RPl) 16 and RPD 50 call for\ndifferent documents. H.PD 16 reque.<;ts produc:tion of seven specific categories of documents\nidentified by name. RJ)D 50 requests production of all documents relating to certain design and\nmanufacturing defects. Second, Plaintiffs addressed RPD 16 and RPD 50 separately at the\nDecember 20th hearing and dcscril)ed the differences between the requ(:sts. Ms. May discussed\nRPD 16 as being a more narrow request targeting spec-ific documents, (.Id. at 5:18-6:20), an(l\ncharac\"i:erized RPD 50 as asldng for a broader scope of document.stied to the~ specific defects at\nissue in the case, (Id. at 10:24-11:12.) Finally, the Court compelled production separately under\nRPI) 16 and RPD 50, in contrast to its treatrnent of RPD 16 (calling for reaction limits) as being\nsynonymous vvith RPDs 25 and 35 (calling for tolerances). (Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\n\n                                               39\n\n                                                                                               MR 0545\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01/13/12 Page 41 of 61\n\n\n\n\nproduce essentially nothing in response.\"\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g Tr. 35:17-\n\n36:6, Doc. 104.)        However, at the September 19, 2011 sanctions hearing,\n\nMichelin's counsel (Ms. Cahoon), stated that because the subject tire went out of\n\nproduction by April 2007 \"many of the documents, in fact as we'll see later,\n\nvirtually all of the documents about manufacture [sic] are gone under retention\n\npolicies before there's ever a lawsuit about the Bates' tire.\"             (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 92:2-9, Doc. 230.) Counsel further stated that \"there was a\n\npretty clear, we thought, understanding with opposing counsel that there were\n\ngoing to be very few, if anything, by way of documents still available from the '98\n\nto 2001 agreed time frame.\"          (Id. at 104:13-16.) Michelin's position at the\n\nSeptember 19th sanctions hearing presented a remarkable about-face from its\n\ncounsel's representation to the Court ten months earlier that if RPD 50 was\n\nframed to cover the summary processes ultimately identified in the Court's\n\nJanuary 3rd Order, she could say that \"[t]hese documents exist and I know they\n\nexist.\") (Dec. 20, 2010 Hr'g Tr. 35-36, Doc. 104).\n\n       However, during the deposition of Michelin's in-house experts in June and\n\n,July 2011, Plaintiffs learned that internal documents such as tire production\n\nstandards, training manuals, and Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis\n\n(FMEAs) existed that Plaintiffs contend should have been produced in response\n\n\n30\n   Michelin ad1nittcdly has ar1 aggressive document destruction policy and retains apparently\nonly the narrowest range of docu1nents necessary for business and regulatory reasons.\n\n\n                                             40\n\n                                                                                          MR 0546\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 42 of 61\n\n\n\n\nto RPD 50. Michelin responded that it had not been required to produce these\n\ndocuments because in its view the January 3rd Order on RPD 50 was limited to\n\nthe tire at issue, the temporal scope of 1998-2001, and documents from the\n\nArdmore plant.'\" Accordingly, Michelin represented to the Court at the July 7th\n\ndiscovery conference that it had produced all documents (almost none) that\n\nexisted subject to those limitations.\n\n       The Court finds that Michelin's interpretation of RPD 50 and the Comt's\n\nJanuary 3rd Order is neither reasonable nor supp01ted by the record as Michelin\n\ncontends.      Michelin interpreted RPD 50 as being redundant of RPD 16.32\n\nConsequently, because the Court's January 3rd Order limited RPD 16 to the\n\n1998-2001 time scope, Michelin treated RPD 50 as also being subject to the 1998-\n\n2001 time scope. As discussed in footnote 29 above, RPD 16 and RPD 50 call for\n\ndifferent documents. Ms. Helm testified at the September 19th sanctions hearing\n\nas to her reading of the Court's January 3rd Order:\n\n       The first thing I interpreted was [the Court] had not limited it to the\n       documents in effect at the time the tire was made, which would have\n       been the documents in use on the 32nd week of 2000. But I read it\n31\n   Nonetheless, Michelin contends that even though it does not believe the trainirtg rnanuals and\n1)roduction standards were responsive to RPD 50, it has since produced (after Plaintiffs' second\nsanctions motion) wl1at is currently available, although not those documents contemporaneous\nin time with the design and manufacture of the tire because those documents no longer exist.\n32 IIowever, the Court notes that Michelin asserted in its December 16, 2010 response to\nPlaintiffs' letter-1notion seeking to compel documents separately under RPD 16 and RPD 50,\nthat RPD 50 \"is inconsistent with Plaintiffs' demand for documents on numerous conditions\nrelating to Request No. 16(b)-(e). If the conditions and components identified in Request No.\n50 are those at issue, MNA will search for and produce the documents in place when the Subject\nTire was manufactured that address those conditions and components.\" (Ex. 3 to Resp. to\nMotion for Sanctions, Doc. 193-4.)\n\n\n                                               41\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0547\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 43 of 61\n\n\n\n\n       as the broader temporal scope of all documents in use from '98 to\n       2001 that related to the components and processes at issue, which\n       we had addressed in the hearing were the aspect specifications or\n       the decision trees, because those were the documents that\n       specifically addressed components or processes.\n\n(Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 156-57, Doc. 230.) The January 3rd Order\n\nspecifically limited Michelin's response to RPD 16 to documents \"in effect during\n\nthe agreed upon time frame.\" (Doc. 90 at 4.) However, with respect to RPD 50,\n\nthe January 3rd Order contains no temporal limitation. Ms. Helm acknowledged\n\nat the September 19th hearing that the January 3rd Order did not contain the\n\nwords \"1998 to 2001\" with respect to the production required for RPD 50 but that\n\nshe limited the Order to that time frame. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 238,\n\nDoc. 230.) Ms. Helm never sought further clarification from the Court on this\n\nissue in the event there was actual confusion.\n\n       Michelin's interpretation is completely unsupported by the language of the\n\nOrder differentiating between RPD 16 and RPD 50 and the essence of counsel's\n\ndiscussion with the Court at the December 20, 2010 hearing,33 (Doc. 90 at 4-5.)\n\nBy interpreting RPD 50 as requesting the same documents as RPD 16, Michelin\n\nlimited its production to only those specific documents already known and\n\nidentified by Plaintiffs.         Michelin thereby avoided producing any other\n\ndocuments which discuss how design or manufacturing problems or deficiencies\n33\n    Michelin asserts tl1at Plaintiffs acquiesced to its interpretation by failing to interpose any\nobjection. This is inaccurate. Rather than ac{111ic·scing to Michelin's treatment of RPD 16 and\nl{_PD 50 as beit1g synonymous, Plaintiffs sought an order com1)elling production of docu1nents in\nresponse to both RPD 16 and RPD 50.\n\n\n                                               42\n\n                                                                                               MR 0548\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 44 of 61\n\n\n\n\ncan result in the alleged defective conditions at issne, i.e. the training documents\n\nand tire prodnction standards discovered by Plaintiffs as having been withheld.\n\nThe Court therefore must conclude that Michelin made a calculated decision to\n\n\"interpret\" the Court's discovery order in the narrow way it saw fit so as to justify\n\nwithholding entire categories of documents that were unambiguously responsive\n\nto Plaintiffs' request in violation of the Court's direct Order.\n\nF.      Michelin's July 19th Produc,-tion in Response to RPD 50\n\n        Despite its steadfast position at the July 7th conference with the Court that\n\nit had complied with the Comt's January 3rd Order and previously produced all\n\nrequired documents, on July 19,            2011,     Michelin produced over        700   pages of\n\ndocuments in connection with RPD 50 in response to Plaintiffs' second request\n\nfor sanctions.34\n\n        One eateg01y of documents Michelin produced on July 19th after Plaintiffs\n\nmoved for sanci:ions referred to as \"Failure Mode and Effects Analysis\" (FMEAs)\n\n34\n   Plaintiffs contend that the adjustment data (specifically requsted in RPD 37) should have also\nbeen produced as responsive to llPD 50 because: (1) the adjustment conditions described a\nreason for whicl1 a tire might be returned; (2) some adjustment sets addressed problems\noriginating with the manufacturing process; and (3) most adjustment condition.c.; listed\nevolutions associated vvith the adjustment condition, i.e problems that could develop if the\nreturned tire \\vas not repaired or replaced. Therefore) according to Plaintiffl'>, \"when an\nadjustment condition belonged to a 'manufacturing' set and was expected to evolve into\n'<>xidati<>n' or the 'infiltration of air' into the rubber, tl1at adjustment condition \\Vas directly\nresponsive to RP]) 50.\" (Doc. 180 at 8.) While the Court agrees that the acljustment data n1ay\nhave been responsive to RPD 50, Michelin sought reconsideration of the January 3rd Order\ncompelling production of the adju&1:1ne11t code data regardless of which of Plaintiffs' RPDs the\ndocuments were responsive to. The Court therefore does not find that Michelin's failure to\nproduce the adjustinent code data in response to llPI) 50 prior t.v the Court's Order on\nDefendant's Motion for Reconsideration (I)oc. 123) was done in bad faith or warrants sanctions\nfor any docu1nents not produced prior to April 28, 2011.\n\n\n                                                43\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0549\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 45 of 61\n\n\n\n\nare internal Michelin documents demonstrating how Michelin evaluates its\n\nmanufacturing process to determine the different ways tires can fail, the effect of\n\nthe failure, and how to fix the identified deficiency,3s Michelin contends that it\n\nproduced these documents in good faith, even though Michelin does not believe\n\nthem to be responsive to Plaintiffs' requests, and that its subsequent production\n\nof these documents should not be used as a basis for imposing the sanction\n\nrequested by Plaintiffs,36 To the contrary, these documents are dearly very\n\nrelevant to Plaintiffs' claims and are directly responsive to RPD 50, The FMEAs\n\ndiscuss the precise conditions identified by Plaintiffs in RPD 50, Le,, trapped air,\n\nadhesion, molding, how those conditions develop in the manufacturing process,\n\nand the methods for detection and prevention of those conditions in a tire before\n\nit leaves the plant,\n\n       As Plaintiffs noted at the September 19th sanctions hearing, Michelin\n\ncharacterized RPD 50 as calling for \"cause and effect\" documents and the FMEAs\n\n---------------\n35 Altho11gh Michelin produced FMEAs that deal with the manufacturing process on July 19th,\nPlaintiffs contend that Michelin is still withholding FMEAs that deal ¥\\1th the design process,\nPlaintiffs learned about the existence of these documents during the July 28th deposition of Mr,\nPatriclc wl10 testified that Michelin also creates and uses FMEAs tl1at deal vvith problems that\nari.se during the (h.'A.;;ign phase, At the September 19th sanctions hearing Michelin ad1nitted the\ndesign FMEAs were not in the design file that was produced: \"We agree they \\Vere not in t11at\nfile, but we 11ever represented that the file wag c::on1plete at all. But what we were able to locate,\nit was produced ... So, there's a lot to evaluate how the tire was designed, even though we can't\nsay that we've got everything,'' (Sept, 19, 2011 Sanction..<; Hr'g Tr. 118: 10-20, l)oc, 230.)\n16\n    Mic::helin redacted \"nonresponsive information\" from several pageg of the FMf:,A docuincnt,\n(MNA 9234- 9271.) Based on the digcovery record thus far, Plaintiffs question the propriety of\nthese redactions and 'vhether the redacted information pertains to the alleged tire defect. The\n(;ourt therefore DIRECTS Michelin to submit these un-redacted pages for the Court's in-\nca1nera inspection.\n\n\n                                                 44\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0550\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 46 of 61\n\n\n\n\nare Michelin's ultimate \"cause and effect\" documents.

The Court finds that Michelin's excuses fall short in\n\nlight of its obligation to cooperate fully in discovery following an order\n\ncompelling produc'l:ion, an order imposing monetary sanc'l:ions, and the court's\n\nprior warning that additional evidence of discovery abuse would not be tolerated.\n\nSee Malautea v.

Thus,\n\nMichelin's post-sanctions production of documents does not excuse its conduct\n\nor obviate the need for sanctions.\n\n       Another category of documents Plaintiffs discovered had not been\n\nproduced in response to the Court's ,January 3rd Order were tire building training\n\nmaterials and production standards identified by Michelin's in-house\n37 During tl1e sanctions hearing, PlaiI1tiffs discussed the relevance of other types of docu1nents\nthat were produce{l on July 19 that described how certain n1anufacturing processes resulted in\nthe precise defects at issue. T11e Court has reviewed these documents and finds that these\ndocuments likewise should have been produced far earlier in response to RPD 50.\n\n\n                                               45\n\n                                                                                               MR 0551\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 47 of 61\n\n\n\n\nmanufacturing expert ,Jack Glazcner.38 At the hearing, Ms. Helm testified that\n\nMichelin decided to produce the training materials39 and tire production\n\ndocmuents referenced by Mr. Glazener in his deposition even though Michelin\n\ndid not regard those documents as being responsive to RPD 50 because Plaintiffs\n\nasked for them specifically in their request for sanctions.                      (Sept. 19, 2011\n\nSanctions Hr'g Tr. 163-64, Doc. 230.) Ms. Helm further testified that Michelin\n\nhas produced such training manuals in the past when specifically requested to do\n\nso. (Id. at 164:2-12.) It appears that Michelin's modus operandi here has been -\n\nat very best - to only produce documents specifically identified by Plaintiffs\n\ndespite the fact a broader set of documents would be responsive to a general\n\ndiscovery request. This ease is eerily similar to Malautea in this regard where the\n\nCourt imposed the sanction of default.\n\n       Another technique the Defendants have used to avoid revealing the\n       truth is to refuse to answer general questions, choosing instead to\n       limit the question to a narrower field. The Plaintiff sought, in\n\n38\n     Ms. Helm testified at the hearing that Michelin did not characterize tire production standards\n(also refen·ed to as tire building procedures) as discussing cause and effect type relationships\nbecause \"they are placed rsic] - thi<> - this component on this drun1 at this angle, check this,\nmove on the next step, do this. It's very much a - it's kind oflilce following a recipe.\" (Sept. 19,\n2011 Sanctions IIr'g Tr. 167, Doc. 230.) This explanation is unavailing - the failure to follow the\nproper procedures is a l)rime exan1ple of a cause and effect relationship. As anyone \\vi.th\ncooking experience is \\Vell aware) the failure to follow certain recipes or to add ingredients in the\nright order can prove disastrous to tl1e final product.\n:-19 On July i9th, Michelin produced quizzes that it gave employees, but only produced answer\nkeys to so1r1c of them. For exa1nple, Michelin produced a quiz with the fo1lo\\ving question\n\"·---is used to prevent a tread separation.\" (Pls.' Ex. X Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g, MNA\n9034) At the hearing Ms. Helm testified that the answers to the quizzes were located on the\nopposite side of the quiz page ai1d could be found in the other materials procluced (MNA 8796 to\n8828) but that no separate answer lceys were available for these particular qUi7.zes.

Ga. 1991). Such\n\nconduct leaves Plaintiffs and this Court continually uncertain whether all\n\nresponsive documents have been produced.\n\nG.    Michelin's Failure to Produce Expert Reports for Employee\n      Experts Patrick and Glazener\n\n      A final issue for which Plaintiffs seek sanctions is Micl1elin's failure to\n\nproduc,e expert reports for its two in-house employee experts identified in its\n\nRule 26 Expert Disclosures on April 29, 2011. Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 26(a)(2)(B)\n\nrequires a written report if the witness is \"one whose duties as the party's\n\nemployee regularly involve giving expert testimony.\" Michelin's Rule 26 Expert\n\nDisclosures identifies Charles Patrick and Jack Glazener as corporate\n\nrepresentatives having technical knowledge and experience regarding certain\n\nsubject areas pertinent to the litigation. (Doc. 232-14 at 4-5.) See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n702. However, Michelin produced no expert reports for these two witnesses.\n\n      Contrary to its representation at the September 19th sanctions hearing,\n\nMichelin did not ever identify Patrick or Glazener as fact witnesses. At the\n\n\n                                       47\n\n                                                                                MR 0553\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 49 of 61\n\n\n\n\nhearing Michelin contended that although it had not identified Glazener and\n\nPatrick in their mandatory disclosures, they were specifically identified as fact\n\nwitnesses on May 11, 2011, in its supplemental responses to Plaintiffs\n\nInterrogatories.       (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 134:11-13, Doc. 230.)\n\nHowever, Glazener and Patrick were only identified at that juncture in response\n\nto Plaintiffs' Interrogatory #4 requesting the identification of Michelin's expert\n\nwitnesses. •0 Indeed, in response to Plaintiffs' Interrogatory # 12 which asked\n\nMichelin to identify the corporate representatives with the most knowledge of the\n\ndesign and manufacturing process, Michelin did not identify Glazener or Patrick\n\nor any other employee or former employee by name.\n\n       Michelin's counsel, Ms. Cahoon, contended that very early in the litigation,\n\n\"there was an indication that Michelin would have some witnesses as fact\n\nwitnesses who would talk about the manufacture and design of the tire. Quite\n\nfrankly, I think Michelin was waiting to see who the tire expert was and what he\n\nwas saying in his report to determine who would be the best fact witnesses to call,\n\nparticularly on the design side, to deal with whatever one could say about\n\nmanufacturing through some knowledgeable witness.\" (Id. at 147.) Ms. Helm\n\nconfirmed it was in fact true and that Mid1elin waited until after Plaintiffs' tire\n\nexpert's report was served to name Glazener and Patrick as fact witnesses \"so that\n\n40\n   Although Michelin only identified Patric}( and Glazener at the end of discovery a.._q experts, it\nsitnu1taneously proclaimed they were not actually experts subject to the requirements of Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 26(a)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0554\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 50 of 61\n\n\n\n\n[Michelin] identified fact witnesses who could address the issues in his report.\"4'\n\n(Id. at 223.) But Glazener and Patrick were never identified as fact witnesses. In\n\nresponse to the Court's concern at the sanctions hearing that Glazener and\n\nPatrick should have been identified earlier as fact witnesses, and while\n\nmaintaining they are fact witnesses, Michelin responded that \"it was a timely\n\nidentification as to experts.\" (Id. at 133:22-23.)\n\n        Michelin identified Mr. Patrick as a Michelin corporate representative\n\nexpected to testify regarding the design of the subject tire and related issnes.\n\n(Doc. 232-14 at 4.) Mr. Patrick was disclosed as having technical knowledge and\n\nexperience regarding the following areas: tire components and nomenclature;\n\ntire design generally; the developmental design process; monitoring of tire\n\nquality and performance; and industry standards and practices regarding tire\n\ndesign. Id. Despite counsel's statement at the September lgth sanctions hearing\n\nto the contrary, Michelin also designated Mr. Patrick to testify that \"the subject\n\ntire's design was not defective.\" Id. Michelin further stated that Mr. Patrick \"may\n\nalso be called to address issues raised by plaintiffs' experts.\" (Doc. 232-16 at 18.)\n\n       Michelin identified Mr. Glazener as a Michelin corporate representative\n\nexpected to testify regarding the manufacture of the subject tire and related\n\n41\n   Michelin maintains this was its strategy dcs1)ite Ms. Helm's representation at the Decen1ber\n20th hearing that \"I'1n national discovery counsel for Michelin, and ... I can take a orte-in-three\nshot as to who their expert is and get it right, at least I - you know, and I proba'bly know \\Vhat\nhis theories arc and I haven't even sec11 the tire yet.\" (Dec. 20, 2010 Disc. Hr'g 1'r. 34:20-35:1,\nDoc. 104.)\n\n\n                                                49\n\n                                                                                                MR 0555\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113/12 Page 51of61\n\n\n\n\nissues.    (Doc. 232-14 at 4.) Mr. Glazener was disclosed as having technical\n\nknowledge and experience regarding the following areas: tire components and\n\nnomenclatnre; tire design generally; mannfactnring and quality assnrance\n\nprocesses in place at the Ardmore, Oklahoma plant at the time the snbject tire\n\nwas manufactured; the Ardmore, Oklahoma manufacturing plant generally;\n\nindustry standards and practices regarding tire manufacturing; and MNA\n\ngenerally. Id. Michelin further stated that Mr. Glazener \"may also be called to\n\ntestify in rebuttal regarding issues raised by plaintiffs' expe1ts.\" (Doc. 232-16 at\n\n19.)\n\n       Plaintiffs have separately filed motions to exclude the testimony of Messrs.\n\nPatrick and Glazener. Therefore, the Court will address the admissibility of\n\ntestimony of these witnesses in a separate order. However, the Court is troubled\n\nby Michelin's extremely late identification of Messrs. Patrick and Glazener, to the\n\nextent they qualify solely as fact witnesses and finds that such a late identification\n\nwas not in good faith and provides further indication of Michelin's pattern of\n\ndiscovery abuse.\n\nH.     Prejudice to Plaintiffs\n\n       As Michelin recognized at the sanctions hearing, the issue in this ease is\n\nwhether the Bates tire was defective - either defective in its design or in its\n\nmanufacturing - and therefore unreasonably dangerous.            The wide array of\n\ndocuments Michelin withheld, is potentially still withholding, and has\n\n\n                                         50\n\n\n                                                                                   MR 0556\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 52 of 61\n\n\n\n\nunquestionably previously destroyed under its internal document \"retention\"\n\npolicy, all go to determining this issue. Michelin claims that the Plaintiffs have\n\nnot been prejudiced in preparing their case to a jury on the merits of the claim\n\nbecause all extant documents have now been produced.\n\n      Michelin's conduct has certainly resulted in delay and disruption of this\n\nlitigation and has hampered the enforcement of this Court's discovery Orders.\n\n8ee Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Corp., 987 F.2d at 1540 (finding that defendants\n\nengaged in an unrelenting campaign to obfuscate the truth by improperly\n\nobjecting to interrogatories, providing incomplete, evasive and unreasonably\n\nnarrow discovery responses, delayed compliance with court orders and thus\n\nhampered the discovery process and showed disdain for the court's orders).\n\nFirst, Michelin's initial production refusal followed by its ongoing delay and\n\nobstruction of discovery central to the case have affected the integrity of the legal\n\nprocess. For example, Michelin's misrepresentations at the December 20, 2010\n\ndiscovery hearing regarding its production of reaction limits and tolerances\n\nresulted in a substantive error in the January 3, 2011 Order that was perpetuated\n\nby Michelin's counsel's failure to correct the Court's misunderstanding about\n\nwhat documents had actually been produced. Michelin refused to produce the\n\ndocuments until ordered to do so by the Comt on September 19, 2011, thereby\n\nprecluding the Plaintiffs from seeking a more expansive production of these\n\ndocuments for over a year and a half.         Moreover, Michelin seeks to limit\n\n\n                                         51\n\n                                                                                  MR 0557\n\f          Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 53 of 61\n\n\n\n\nPlaintiffs' potential recovery on the gronnds that there is no evidence to support a\n\nclaim for punitive damages after attempting to withhold the very documents on\n\nwhich Plaintiffs rely to demonstrate a conscious indifference to the tire's defective\n\ndesign and manufacture. (Sept. 19, 2011 Sanctions Hr'g Tr. 54, Doc. 230.)\n\n         Second, Michelin delayed producing its most relevant documents and data\n\nfor over a year and a half while seeking to exclude the testimony of Plaintiffs' tire\n\nexpert, in part, on the grounds that his opinions are based on insufficient or\n\nunreliable data. (Doc. 203, 204) Yet, Michelin refused to produce documents\n\nand data that might potentially support Plaintiffs' expert's opinions regarding the\n\ndefectiveness of the subject tire.\n\n         Finally, Michelin's dilatory discovery gamesmanship has hampered\n\nPlaintiffs' pursuit of a swift judicial process to provide a remedy addressing the\n\nextreme nature of Mr. Bates' physical injuries. Plaintiffs' steadfast efforts to\n\nmove this case forward to resolution at trial, including their streamlined\n\ndiscovery42 , has been needlessly deferred by Michelin's haggling and endless\n\nparsing over the production of its evidence on its own time schedule. Not only\n\nhas this delay and disruption of the litigation prejudiced Plaintiffs, it\n\ndemonstrates Michelin's bad faith. Byrne v. Nezhat, 261 F.3d at 1121. Thus,\n\nMichelin's course of conduct described herein warrants the imposition of\n\n\n42   PlaintiffS submitted only one set of Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents\nand tool<:: a limited number of fact depositions.\n\n\n                                                    52\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0558\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01/13/12 Page 54 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanctions to remedy the impact of repeated violations of the Court's Orders,\n\ninaccurate representations to the Court, and prolonged abusive discovery\n\nconduct.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n       The Court docs not impose sanctions lightly and has taken great care in the\n\nreview of the record before it in its determination of this matter. The pattern of\n\nabuse by Michelin is extremely troubling. The Court is obligated to uphold the\n\nintegrity of the legal and discovery process to ensure that Plaintiffs here and all\n\nparties have the opportunity to fairly present their claims in a reasonably efficient\n\nand prompt manner. Plaintiffs would not have uncovered the majority of the\n\nmost probative documents in existence in this case but for their persistence in\n\npursuing discovery motions and seeking the Court's intervention. Contrary to\n\nMichelin's assertion that this belated production demonstrates its good faith, it is\n\nprecisely this ongoing belated production, in conjunction with Michelin's\n\nmultiple violations of the Court's Orders and its evasive, hair-splitting and\n\ninaccurate representations to the Court that demonstrate Michelin's bad faith\n\nand why a serious, substa11tive sanction is warra11ted.\n\n       A determination that the tire at issue in this case 1s defective and\n\nunreasonably dangerous is an appropriate sanction to remedy the discovery\n\nabuses perpetrated by Michelin in bad faith and in disregard of this Court's prior\n\ndiscovery Orders. First, Michelin made multiple misrepresentations to the Court\n\n\n                                         53\n\n                                                                                  MR 0559\n\f           Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 55 of 61\n\n\n\n\nthat it had produced documents as ordered by the Court when it in fact had not.\n\nSecond, Michelin repeatedly refused to produce documents in direct violation of\n\nthe Court's January 3rd, June 3rd and .June 24th Orders.           Third, Michelin\n\nintentionally engaged in an extremely narrow, unjustified interpretation of the\n\nCourt's Orders in order to limit, or altogether avoid, producing relevant and\n\nuseful documents in response to Plaintiffs' discovery requests.\n\n          Furthermore, a finding that the tire was defective and unreasonably\n\ndangerous is properly tailored to address Michelin's sanctionable discovery\n\nconduct as set forth below:\n\n          • Michelin's failure to produce adjnstment codes and data: This is the\n\nsecond round of the parties' dispute over the production of the adjustment codes\n\nand data. After the Court's June 24, 2011 Order sanctioning Michelin for its\n\nimproper redaction of the adjustment codes and failure to produce the\n\ndocuments necessary to interpret the list of adjustment codes and conditions,\n\nMichelin again failed to produce all documents ordered by the Court. Despite it.>\n\nspirited representations to the Court on July 7, 2011, that all the adjustment\n\ncodes had been produced as ordered on .June 13, 2011, an additional 113\n\nadjustment codes had been withheld and later had to be produced. While this\n\ninitial    failure   may   not   have   been   intentional,   Michelin's   repeated\n\nmisrepresentations to the Court during the course of discovery call into serious\n\ndoubt the credibility of Michelin's assertions that the failure to produce the\n\n\n                                         54\n\n                                                                                MR 0560\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Flied 01113112 Page 56 of 61\n\n\n\n\nadjustment code documents was an innocent, inadvertent mistake that would\n\nhave been cured without Plaintiffs pointing to gaps in the production.\n\n       Moreover, after providing Plaintiffs with a complete list of the codes and\n\nconditions for adjustment, Michelin was required to produce the data\n\ndemonstrating the number of tires returned under Michelin's adjustment\n\nprocess. Subsequent to the Court's June       24, 2011   Order directing Michelin to\n\n\"produce all available tire adjustmeut data and the iuternal mauuals Michelin\n\nuses for classifying or discussing the conditions and issues arising in connection\n\nwith the application of the specific adjustment codes,\" (Doc. 173 at   11),   Michelin\n\ninstead produced an indecipherable chart along with a glossary created for the\n\nlitigation.\n\n       Despite being previously sanctioned for producing a meaningless list of\n\nadjustment conditions without the necessary interpretative documents, Michelin\n\nagain produced a chart of adjustment data that could not even be interpreted by\n\nMichelin's own in-house expert. Mr. Patrick testified that Michelin does not\n\nanalyze its adjustment data in the format produced to Plaintiffs in this litigation\n\nand confirmed that the adjustment data, if presented in a meaningful format,\n\ncould be used to determine whether (and how many) tires were being rctnrned\n\nfor conditions resulting from a manufacturing or design issue, whether Michelin\n\nwas aware of such conditions in the tire, and whether any changes were made to\n\nthe tire as a result of a high return rate. Michelin's production of the adjustment\n\n\n                                        .55\n\n                                                                                   MR 0561\n\f       Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 57 of 61\n\n\n\n\ndata in this indecipherable format flies in the face of the Court's June    24, 2011\n\nOrder warning Michelin \"that any failure to respond fully in producing these\n\ndocuments and tire data may result in the imposition of sanctions, including ...\n\ndetermination of issue preclusion relative to the tire defect at issue.\" (Doc. 173 at\n\n11.)\n\n       •   Michelin's failure to produce reaction limits and tolerances:         TI1e\n\nreaction limits and tolerances used by tire builders to determine whether and\n\nhow much a tire deviates from its manufacturing specifications and whether the\n\ntire must be scrapped are directly probative of the defect issue. Nonetheless,\n\nMichelin's counsel allowed the Court and Plaintiffs to rely on her inaccurate\n\nstatements at the December      20, 2010   discovery hearing that the reaction limits\n\nand tolerances had been produced in the design file, when they in fact had not\n\nbeen. When counsel realized she had misled the Court after her review of the\n\nCourt's January 3,   2011   Order upon immediate receipt, she failed to contact the\n\nCourt or Plaintiffs' counsel to clarify this seminal issue. Even after Plaintiffs\n\ndiscovered the error during the July       28, 2011   deposition of Mr. Patrick who\n\ntestified that the file did not contain the reaction limits or tolerances, Michelin\n\nrefused to produce relevant documents until ordered by the Court after the\n\nSeptember 19, 2011 sanctions hearing.\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\n                                                                                  MR 0562\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 58 of 61\n\n\n\n\n      • Michelin's failureJ:Q_l)roduce__Qocuments rcspon_sive to RPD           50   as\n      compelled on Januazy 3, 2010:\n\n      For nearly two years Michelin failed to produce         700   pages of relevant\n\ndocuments in response to RPD 50 requesting information discussing specific\n\ndefects that may arise in a tire's components and processes based on Michelin's\n\nself-imposed limitation of the temporal scope of the Court's January 3,         2010\n\nOrder.     Despite Michelin's repeated insistence at the December          20, 2010\n\ndiscovery hearing that it was not attempting to limit the scope of Plaintiffs'\n\ndiscovery requests so that it was left having to produce nothing, Michelin's\n\ncounsel's statements at the September 19,    2011   sanctions hearing confirmed that\n\nMichelin knew there were very few documents still in existence within the 1998-\n\n2001 time frame. Tl1us, Michelin's convenie11t \"interpretation\" of the Court's\n\nJanuary 3, 2011 Order compelling production of \"the requested documents for\n\nthe components and processes at issne\" as being snbject to the 1998-2001\n\ntemporal scope, was calcnlated to jnstify its withholding hnndreds of docnments\n\nthat were unquestionably responsive to Plaintiffs' request.\n\n      Because the adjustment codes and data, reaction limits and tolerances, and\n\nthe documents responsive to RPD 50 all specifically relate to Plaintiffs' claim that\n\nthe tire at issue was defective, an order establishing that the subject tire was\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous as manufactured and sold to Plaintiffs is\n\n\n\n\n                                        57\n\n                                                                                    MR 0563\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01113112 Page 59 of 61\n\n\n\n\nnarrowly tailored to remedy Michelin's violations and therefore appropriate\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b). See Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 707.\n\n        Michelin objects to Plaintiffs' sanctions request on the grounds that\n\nPlaintiffs did not first initiate a \"meet and confer\" on each of these discovery\n\nissues. The Court previously rejected this argument in its June 24, 2011 Order,\n\nand found that Michelin was ohligated to comply with the Court's January 3, 2011\n\nOrder compelling the production of the documents and that no \"meet and confer\"\n\nsession was required prior to Plaintiffs seeking sanctions for Michelin's failure to\n\nfully comply the Court's prior orders.4'1 Malautea, 987 F.2d at 1542-43 (finding\n\nthat defendants \"richly deserved the sanction of default judgment\" where the\n\ndiscovery orders clearly encompassed the information requested hy plaintiffs\");\n\nIn re Sunshine Jr. Stores, 456 F.3d at \\306. In addition, Michelin received more\n\nthan adequate notice from (1) the Court's multiple warnings that it would not\n\ntolerate any further hampering of the discovery process or violations of its\n\nOrders; (2) Plaintiffs' multiple sanctions requests; and (3) its own flagrant\n\ndisregard of the federal discovery rules and the Court's discovery orders. In re\n\nSunshine Jr. Stores, 456 F.3d at 1306. Therefore, the sanction of issue preclusion\n\nis warranted by the record in this case. Finally, the Court's previous monetary\n43 Moreover, after the (;ourt entered the ,January 3, 201.1 Order compelling production of the\nvarious RPDs, Plaintiffs contend they had no reason to believe that documents were l)eing\nwithheld. Plaintiffs were unaware that other internal Michelin documents existed until the\ndeposition of Michelin's in-hous.-e expert Glazener - ::.i_x months later - who testified about his\n1mowledge of ce1i:ain documents based on his past \\Vork as the Ardmore plant manager.\nMichelin did. not identify Mr. Glazener as a witness until close to the end of discovery.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0564\n\f         Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13/12 Page 60 of 61\n\n\n\n\nsanction did not serve to remedy Michelin's cavalier attitude toward its\n\nobligations to comply with the Court's Orders and the discovery process.\n\n         In sum, Michelin's bad faith conduct caused serious prejudice to the\n\nintegrity of the legal process and to Plaintiffs' orderly, effective development and\n\nproof of their case. Michelin's course of conduct described herein warrants the\n\nimposition of sanctions to remedy the impact of repeated violations of the Court's\n\nOrders, inaccurate or false representations to the Court, and prolonged abusive\n\ndiscovery conduct. Under the circumstances presented here, a finding of issue\n\npreclusion as to the subject tire's defective and unreasonably dangerous\n\ncondition is authorized as an appropriately tailored sanction remedy. See Ins.\n\nCorp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 707.          However, the Court declines to move beyond\n\nthis serious sanction and will not impose Plaintiffs' additional request for an\n\nissue preclusion determination that the subject tire failed as a result of its\n\ndefective and unreasonably dangerous condition.44                   The sanction applied is\n\nsufficient under the circumstances to address the scope of Michelin's discovery\n\nabuse.\n\n\n44 'fhe Court recognizes that Michelin has now i)roduced a more complete set of docu1ncnts and\ndata in response to I)laintiffs' Requests for Production and tl1c Court's Orders. 'fhough the\ncredibility of Michelin's representation as to the complete11ess of this production remains in\nquestion for the reasons discussed in this Order, the Co11rt has recognized Michelin's corrective\nprod.uction as a factor in its decisio11 to refrain fron1 imposing Plaintiffs' requested sanction of\ntotal issue preclusion - a determination tl1at the tire failed as a result o.f its defective a11d\nunreasonably dangerous condition. 'IJ1at determination would be the death knell of any\nMichelin defense to liability. Instead, t11e Court has left open the question of whether the failure\nof the tire in fact was the proximate cause (or partial cause) of Mr. Bates' car accident.\n\n\n                                                59\n\n                                                                                                MR 0565\n\f        Case 1:09-cv-03280-AT Document 269 Filed 01/13112 Page 61of61\n\n\n\n\n      Accordingly, the Court GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n\nPlaintiffs' Motion for Sanctions [Doc. 180, 181). The court further DIRECTS\n\nMichelin to submit an unredacted copy of MNA 9234-9271 for the Court's in-\n\ncamera inspection. Finally, Plaintiffs may file a petition for reimbursement of\n\ntheir attorney's fees associated with their second request for sanctions pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 37 (b)(2)(C) within 15 days of this Order.

Thus, plaintiffo argue that all the decision tree documents\n        applicable at the time the tire was made are relevant.\n\n       The C<)Urt agrees.

This question was squarely addressed by the Beaumont Court of\n\nAppeals:\n\n               the plaintiffs seek to depose an Exxon representative for the purpose of\n          inquiring specifically into the process by which Exxon's representative responded\n          to the requests for production. This subject necessarily and almost exclusively\n          concerns the 'mental impressions developed in anticipation of litigation or for\n          trial by or for a party or a party's representatives' and consists of the 'attorney's\n          representative's mental impressions, opinions, conclusions, or legal theories'\n          subject to protection as work product and core work product.\n\nIn re Exxon Corp., 208 S.W.3d at 75.              The Houston Court of Appeals reached the same\n\nconclusion when considering a request to depose a corporate representative with knowledge of\n\n\"who searched for documents related to roof vents and roof hatches . . . which buildings were\n\nsearched; and the manner in which the search was conducted.\" In re Boxer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4250123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n\n* 1.

Motion to Delay Ruling on Discovery of Net Worth Information\n\n          By enacting section 41.0115 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, the Texas\n\nlegislature amended the law regarding the pre-trial discovery of net worth information. Exh. A\n\n(CPRC §41.0115). By its terms, section 41.0115 applies to all cases that were filed on or after\n\nSeptember 1, 2015. Exh. B (Senate Bill 735) While this case was filed prior to September 1,\n\n2015, the Texas Supreme Court is currently considering whether section 41.0115 (the\n\ncodification of Senate Bill 735) should be applied to cases, like this one, that were filed prior to\n\nthe law's effective date.    Exh. C (Jn re Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5102928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Petition for Writ of\n\nMandamus).       The parties have already submitted briefing on this issue and the matter was\n\nsubmitted for the Supreme Court's consideration on October 13, 2015. Exh. D (Docket Sheet).\n\nThe Supreme Court will almost certainly issue a ruling in In re Robinson during the pendency of\n\nthis lawsuit, most likely before the end of the year. MNA requests that this Court delay its ruling\n\non plaintiffs' motion to compel the deposition of a representative of MNA regarding its financial\n\nstatus until the Texas Supreme Court has issued its ruling in the In re Robinson matter.\n\nB.        Texas Legislature Recently Altered Standard for Discovery of Net Worth Information.\n\n          Since the Texas Supreme Court issued its opinion in Lunsford v. Morris in 1988, some\n\nTexas courts have permitted the discovery of a party's net worth based on nothing more than an\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0760\n\fallegation that punitive damages were appropriate. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521359\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521359/lunsford-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Here there is only a bare\n\nallegation of punitive damages and there are no facts to support such an award. Indeed, the facts\n\ndeveloped in discovery demonstrate that the conduct of a third party may be responsible for the\n\naccident, not the conduct of MNA. Because there are numerous legislative actions and court\n\nopinions limiting the recovery of exemplary damages since Lunsford was issued, this Court\n\nshould not allow discovery of punitive damages at all unless and until facts are developed to\n\nsupport them.\n\n          Trial courts have struggled with the proper procedures for managing the discovery of a\n\nparty's net worth in cases involving allegations of punitive damages. To clarify this issue, the\n\nTexas legislature added section 41.0115 to the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code,\n\nannouncing a clear and concise procedure for courts to follow when a party's net worth is at\n\nissue. MNA contends that the procedure announced in section 41.0115 should govern plaintiffs'\n\nrequest for MNA's financial information in this case. Subsections (a) and (b) of section 41.0115\n\nrequire that, to obtain net worth information, a party must obtain a written order from the trial\n\ncourt finding that he has demonstrated a \"substantial likelihood of success\" on the merits of a\n\nclaim for punitive damages after a hearing on the issue:\n\n          (a) On the motion of a party and after notice and a hearing, a trial court may\n          authorize discovery of evidence of a defendant's net worth if the court finds in a\n          written order that the claimant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of\n          success on the merits of a claim for exemplary damages. Evidence submitted by a\n          paiiy to the court in support of or in opposition to a motion made under this\n          subsection may be in the form of an affidavit or a response to discovery.\n\n          (b) If a trial court authorizes discovery under Subsection (a), the court's order may\n          only authorize use of the least burdensome method available to obtain the net\n          worth evidence.\n\nTEX. C1v. P. & REM. CODE §41.0115. Even when a plaintiff successfully shows a \"substantial\n\nlikelihood of success\" on a punitive damages claim, the court may only authorize the \"least\n\n\n                                                   4\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0761\n\fburdensome method available\" to obtain the net worth evidence.             Id.   Thus, if a party can\n\nproduce documents that demonstrate its net worth once a plaintiff has made the requisite\n\nshowing, it is highly unlikely that compelling the deposition of a representative with knowledge\n\nof a corporation's net worth would be found the \"least burdensome method available\" to\n\ndemonstrate net worth.\n\n          If the Supreme Court determines that section 41. 0115 is applicable to cases, like this one,\n\nthat were filed prior to September 1, 2015, plaintiffs' demand for the deposition of a\n\nrepresentative of MNA to testify regarding its financial condition is premature. Plaintiffs have\n\nnot followed the procedure established in section 41.0115 for obtaining discovery regarding\n\nMNA's net worth or even attempted to demonstrate a \"substantial likelihood of success\" on their\n\nclaim for punitive damages against MNA. Even if the plaintiffs could make such a showing,\n\nwhich is denied, demanding the deposition of a representative of MNA on its financial status\n\nwould not be the least burdensome method of obtaining MNA's net worth.\n\n                                   III.\n   DISCOVERY OF NET WORTH AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE\n  PERMITTED AT THIS POINT EVEN IF NEWLY ENACTED §41.0115 OF TEXAS CIVIL\n         PRACTICE & REMEDIES CODE DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS CASE\n\n          Even if the Supreme Court finds that section 41.0115 is not applicable to cases filed prior\n\nto September 1, 2015, plaintiffs should not be permitted to obtain discovery regarding MNA's\n\nnet worth or financial condition at this juncture.        The Texas Supreme Court established a\n\nbifurcated procedure for trials involving claims for exemplary damages due to the \"very real\n\npotential\" that evidence of a defendant's wealth will prejudice the jury's determination of other\n\ndisputed issues in tort cases. Transp. Inc. Co. v. Mariel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (Tex. 1990). The\n\nTexas Legislature later codified that procedure in Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section\n\n41.009. Under the bifurcated procedure, evidence or mention of a defendant's net worth is\n\n\n                                                   5\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  MR 0762\n\fcompletely inadmissible during the first phase of a bifurcated trial.       In fact, evidence of a\n\ndefendant's net worth is only admissible in the second phase of a bifurcated trial following a\n\nunanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages, by clear and convincing evidence. TEX.\n\nClv. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 41.003; 41.009 (emphasis added).\n\n          As a result of these challenging evidentiary hurdles, the majority of cases involving\n\npunitive damages do not make it to the second phase of trial. See In re Jacobs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761274/in-re-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n50 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, orig. proceeding) (Sullivan, J., concurring). In such\n\ncases, information concerning a defendant's net worth is absolutely inadmissible and the\n\ndiscovery of such information is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible\n\nevidence.\n\n          Moreover, \"trial courts should be mindful of protecting sensitive information and utilize\n\nthe least intrusive means necessary to facilitate discovery.\" Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d at 46, citing In\n\nre Weekly Homes, L.P., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895162\"><a href=\"/opinion/895162/in-re-weekley-homes-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321 (Tex. 2009). That includes ensuring the correct\n\ntiming, as well as the correct scope, of discovery.      The discovery of net worth information\n\nsubjects defendants, like MNA, to extreme risk of prejudice, as well as unnecessary violations of\n\nprivacy through disclosure of highly sensitive, confidential financial information. The disclosure\n\nof such information will result in a grave risk to MNA and endanger MNA's ability to remain\n\nfinancially competitive in a highly competitive business environment. The Court should engage\n\nin a proper balancing of the burdens and benefits of discovery, particularly as colored by the\n\nimportance of the privacy interests at stake, and prohibit discovery of MNA's net worth unless\n\nand until it is determined that MNA is liable to plaintiffs for punitive damages.\n\n          WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, defendant Michelin North America, Inc.\n\nprays that this Court deny plaintiffs' motion to compel the depositions of representatives of\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n4543932\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0763\n\fMNA regarding (1) MNA's discovery responses and (2) MNA's financial condition.

Plaintiff Nathan S. Ates, is the\nrepresentative of the Estate of Joyce A. Ates, who died as a result of the accident. Co-Plaintiffs Sonia Ates, and Nathan M.\nAtes (all plaintiffs referred to herein collectively as \"Ates\" ) are heirs of the Decedent. The helicopter was owned by\nHelicopter Services, Inc., and piloted by Christopher Yeager (\"Yeager\"). Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. (\"Robinson\")\nis the manufacturer of the helicopter, a 2007 Robinson R22 Beta II helicopter (the \"Aircraft\"). Plaintiffs and Real Party in\nInterest bring the current suit for damages arising out of the Accident, in several capacities. Ates sued Relator, Robinson\nHelicopter Company, Inc ., as the manufacturer of the Aircraft, Helicopter Services, Inc., as the owner of the Aircraft and the\npilot's employer, as well as the estate of the pilot, Christopher Yeager.\n\nRespondent:\n\nRespondent, Judge Mike D. Miller, (\"Respondent\") is the presiding judge of the 11th Judicial District Court of Harris\nCounty, Texas.\n\nActions from Which Realtor Seeks Relief:\n\nBased on Ates' claims for exemplary damages against Robinson, Ates seeks discovery of Robinson's net worth . Robinson\nobjected to such discovery based on *ix its \"good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\"\nAtes filed a Motion to Compel Discovery which was granted by the trial court. Robinson then filed a Motion for\nReconsideration and Motion for Limited Emergency Stay, both of which were denied by the trial court.

Tex. Const. art. 5, §6; Tex. Gov't Code §\n22.00l(c).\n\n                                                *~~SUESPRESENTED\n\n\nI. Did Respondent commit an abuse of discretion by misapplying applicable law and ordering the discovery of information\nrelating to Relator's net worth without a finding of liability for exemplary damages?\n\n2. Does Respondent's order requiring discovery of information relating to Relator's net worth constitute an error for which\nthere is no adequate remedy at law?\n\n                                               *1 STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nHelicopter Services, Inc. is the owner of that certain 2007 Robinson R22 Beta Helicopter, Registration Number N28 I RG.\nChristopher Yeager (\"Yeager\") was an employee of Helicopter Services. On or about September 10, 2012, Yeager and Joyce\nA. Ates (\"Decedent\") were aboard the Aircraft departing from Baytown Airport. Approximately two hours in to the flight,\nthe Aircraft crashed. Yeager and Decedent died as a result of the injuries suffered in the Accident. (App. 5; ROl40).\n\nPlaintiffs and Real Party in Interest, Nathan S. Ates, Individually and as Personal Representative of the Estate of Joyce A.\nAtes, Deceased; Sonia Ates and Nathan M. Ates (collectively \"Ates\" and/or Plaintiffs) bring the current suit against Relator,\nRobinson Helicopter Company, Inc., as the manufacturer of the Aircraft, Helicopter Services, Inc., as the owner of the\nAircraft and the pilot's employer, as well as the estate of the pilot, Christopher Yeager. (ROOOl-0054; R0200-0228).\n\nAtes' Original Petition includes claims against Robinson alleging negligence in the design and manufacture of the Aircraft\nand defective design of the Aircraft. Ates also includes a vague claim of \"intentional\" conduct and \"willful, wonton and\nmalicious activities\" by Robinson. However, Ates fails to provide any factual support for their claims. (ROOO 1-0054;\nR0200-0228).\n\nIn connection with their Original Petition, Ates served Requests for Production of Documents, seeking the production of\nevidence to establish *2 Robinson's net worth. (ROOOl-0054). Due to the highly sensitive nature of the requested\ninformation, combined with the extreme risk of unfair prejudice, Robinson objected. (App. 5; R0140-0199; App. 6;\nR0246-0257). Ates filed a motion to compel Robinson's net worth, to which Robinson responded with this \"good faith\nargument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\" (App. 4; R0095-0136; App. 5; R0140-0199; App. 6;\nR0246-0257).\n\nPlaintiffs' motion was heard on May 11, 2015. On June 19, 2015, the Governor signed Senate Bill 735 into law, which\naddresses net worth discovery. (App. 8).\n\nRobinson filed a Supplemental Opposition to Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel on June 26, 2015. (App. 6; R0246-0257).\nHowever, the trial court had previously entered an Order granting Plaintiffs' Motion, requiring Robinson to \"provide\ndocuments sufficient to establish the current net worth of Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc.\" on June 24, 2015. (App. l;\nR0244-0245).\n\nOn July 2, 2015, Robinson filed a Motion for Reconsideration based on the recent enactment of SB735. (App. 2;\nR0258-0270). On July 7, 2015, the trial court denied Robinson's Motion and ordered the requested documents produced by\n5:00 p.m. on July 8, 2015. (App. 3; R0271). Robinson's petition for writ of mandamus was filed in the Court of Appeals on\nJuly 8, 2015, and was subsequently denied on August 4, 2015. (App. 11). This petition for writ of mandamus follows.\n\n                                         *3 SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nThe existing case law setting the standards for discovery ofa defendant's net worth is based on this Court's 1988 opinion in\nLunsford v. Morris. There have been substantial changes to exemplary damages law in the intervening years, both as a result\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                    MR 0774\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relator., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5102928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015)\n\n\n\nof this Court's subsequent opinions and as a result sweeping limitations on exemplary damage claims as passed by the Texas\nLegislature. Defendants such as Robinson should not be required to disclose its net worth based on a few conclusory,\nfactually devoid assertions in Ates' petition, which includes vague and factually unsupported claims of \"intentional\" conduct\nand \"wilful, wonton and malicious activities\" by Robinson but does not allege any particular design defect or act of\nnegligence. Without more, the discovery of Robinson's sensitive and confidential financial information should not be\npermitted. For cases pre-dating the effective date of SB735, this Court can give direction and guidance to trial courts by\nadopting the procedures of SB735 as the proper procedure for managing net worth discovery.\n\nFor years, Texas courts have recognized the lack of guidance and constancy in case law and statutes regarding the discovery\nof net worth evidence. The Legislature has repeatedly acted to tightly restrict the ability of litigants to seek and recover\nexemplary damages in the years following the decision in Lunsford. *4 However, the procedures of Texas courts have not\nevolved to keep up with these legislative changes.\n\nSB735 provides clarity and guidance for handling net worth discovery. SB735 requires a party seeking net worth discovery to\nfirst obtain an order from the trial court finding that there is a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a claim for\nexemplary damages. The provisions of SB735 are not effective until September 1, 2015 and are not binding on the present\ncase, leaving cases pre-dating SB735 with no guidance on net worth discovery. The current procedures are do not reflect the\nchanges made by the Legislature and need to be revisited.\n\nThus, while there is now clarity and direction in cases filed after September 1, 2015, it falls to this Court to clarify when and\nhow net worth discovery should be permitted in cases filed prior to September 1, 2015. Even applying the existing laws, the\ndiscovery of a defendant's net worth is improper absent a finding of liability for exemplary damages in a bifurcated trial.\nOtherwise, the discovery order exceeds the scope of permissible discovery as set out in the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure\nand violates the limitations on the availability of exemplary damages, as set out in Chapter 41.\n\nRobinson respectfully urges this Court to apply the procedures adopted in SB735 for cases filed before SB735 becomes\neffective. The Legislature has clearly indicated what it considers to be the proper procedures involving net worth *5\ndiscovery. Accordingly, Robinson respectfully requests that the trial court be required to hold a \"gatekeeper\" hearing, after an\nadequate time for discovery has passed, as envisioned by SB735 to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is\na substantial likelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages.\n\nAlternatively, Robinson requests that this Court order the trial court to conduct discovery within the limitations of the\nexisting provisions of Chapter 41 and the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Only upon a finding of liability during phase one\nof a bifurcated trial does evidence of a defendant's net worth become relevant and admissible and therefore that is the only\ncircumstance in which disclosure of a defendant's net worth should be compelled.\n\n\n\n                                                         ARGUMENT\n\n\nII. RESPONDENT'S ERRONEOUS MISAPPLICATION OF THE LAWS GOVERNING NET WORTH\nDISCOVERY CONSTITUTES A CLEAR ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\n\nA. STAND ARD OF REVIEW FOR ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\nA trial court abuses its discretion if it acts in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner or without reference to guiding rules and\nprinciples. Walker v. Packer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428092\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428092/walker-v-packer/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839 (Tex. 1992). When determining legal principles, a trial court has no\ndiscretion to misinterpret or misapply the law. Id. at 840. Thus, a clear failure to analyze or correctly apply the law\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion. Id.; see e.g., *6 In re Essex Ins., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525-26 (Tex. 2014). A trial court's\nerroneous legal conclusion is an abuse of discretion, even if the law is unsettled. Huie v. DeShazo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462739\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462739/huie-v-deshazo/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927-28\n(Tex. 1996). Under certain circumstances, a trial court's action can constitute an abuse of discretion even though it is\nconsistent with existing jurisprudence, but where the action conflicts with what the current law ought to be.

THE LEGISLATURE HAS PROVIDED A CLEAR AND CONCISE PROCEDURE FOR NET WORTH\nDISCOVERY IN TEXAS.\n\n\na. Senate Bill 735 answers the judicial pleas for clarification of procedure regarding the discoverability of a party's\nnet worth in cases involving exemplary damages.\n\nSince this Court's 1988 holding in Lunsford v. Morris, (</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521359\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521359/lunsford-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1988) (orig. proceeding)), trial courts have\nstruggled with the proper procedures for managing the discovery of a party's net worth in cases involving exemplary\ndamages. This is particularly true in light of the extensive changes made by the Legislature in the years since Lunsford. The\nprocedures employed by the courts have not evolved to reflect the legislative changes. The Legislature has responded to the\njudicial pleas for clarification by setting out a clear and concise procedure for the courts to follow in cases where a party's net\nworth is in issue by enacting Senate Bill 735. However, for cases pre-dating the effective date of *7 SB735, the struggle\nremains. It is within the authority of this Court to clarify the procedures for cases pre-dating SB735, including the present\ncase. There should be but one consistent procedure for addressing net worth discovery in all cases, present and future.\n\nSB735 requires parties seeking net worth discovery to obtain a written order from the trial court finding, \"the claimant has\ndemonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of a claim for exemplary damages.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode Section 41.0115. (App. 8). SB735 also provides said hearing should only be held after an adequate time for the\ndiscovery of facts relating to exemplary damages has been made. (App. 8).\n\nGiven the recognized need to clarify the appropriate procedures for discovery of net worth evidence, and the dramatic\nchanges in punitive damages law over the last thirty years, Robinson respectfully urges this Court to provide the much\nneeded guidance to the lower courts and adopt the procedures of SB735 for the discovery of a defendant's net worth, even in\ncases pre-dating SB735. More specifically, Robinson respectfully requests that the trial court be required to hold a\n\"gatekeeper\" hearing, as envisioned by SB735 to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is a substantial\nlikelihood that they will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages against Robinson.\n\n\n\n*8 b. Texas Law regarding exemplary damages has changed substantially, and the courts need clear guidance from\nthis Court on the procedures for addressing net worth discovery.\n\nIn 1988, this Court held that a defendant's net worth is relevant in a suit involving exemplary damages. Lumford, 746\nS.W.2d at 473. As a result, parties may discover and offer evidence of a defendant's net worth in cases where exemplary\ndamages may be awarded. Id. In 1995, the Legislature passed sweeping tort reform to the substantive and procedural law\ngoverning exemplary damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§§ 41.001-.013. Chapter 41 was significantly rewritten to\nprovide defendants dramatic protection from exemplary-damage awards. Such changes include:\n•Exemplary damages were limited to assessing damages with the purpose of punishing the defendant.\n\n• Chapter 41 's coverage was expanded to apply to all but a very few types of tort actions.\n\n• A plaintiffs burden of proof for exemplary damages was elevated to clear and convincing evidence.\n\n• With few limitations, a defendant could no longer be exposed to exemplary damages because of another person's criminal\nact.\n\n•The Legislature lowered the existing cap on exemplary damages.\n\n• Upon a defendant' s motion, the trial court had to bifurcate the jury's determination of the amount of exemplary damages,\nand evidence of a *9 defendant' s net worth could not be admitted during the liability phase of the trial.

First, they further limited the\namount of exemplary damages that could be assessed. See id. § 1 secs. 41.007, 41.008. Second, and more significantly, these\nrevisions dramatically lessened the chances of any exemplary-damage recovery by a claimant. See id. § I §§ 41.001(5),\n41.002, 41.003(b), 41.005 .\n\nIn 2003, the Legislature further eroded a plaintiffs ability to recover exemplary damages. Now, unlike the general rule\npermitting a civil verdict upon the vote of only ten jurors, an award of exemplary damages requires a unanimous verdict as to\nliability for, and the amount of, such damages. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 4 l .003(d); Tex. R. Civ. P. 292; DeAtley v.\nRodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401976\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401976/trish-deatley-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\nThe current procedures are \"decades-old [and] do not reflect the changes made by the Legislature and, in light of the\nevolution of Texas law, and needs to be revisited.\" See In re Jacobs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761274/in-re-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (Tex. App. - Houston [14th Dist.]\n2009, pet. denied) (orig. proceeding) (Sullivan, J., concurring). In 1998, Justice Gonzalez recognized the difficulty which\nresulted from the lack of direction regarding discovery of net worth information. \"These issues are significant and demand\nthe Court's attention.\" In re Jerry 's Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799713\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799713/in-re-jerrys-chevrolet-buick-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (Tex. 1998) (Gonzalez, J., dissenting).\n\n*10 This Court was willing to address these issues previously. Id. This Court granted petitions for writ of mandamus in\nAramark Uniform Services, Inc. v. Tyson, 40 Tex. Sup. J. 84 (November 15, 1996), and Perry Home Contractors, Inc. v.\nPatterson, 39 Tex. Sup. J. 237 (February 9, 1996), to determine whether a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of\nentitlement to exemplary damages before discovering evidence of a defendant's net worth. However, this Court was unable to\nclarify net worth discovery because each of those cases were settled. Perry Home Contractors, Inc. v. Patterson, 40 Tex. Sup.\nJ. 398 (March 6, 1997); Aramark Uniform Servs., Inc. v. Tyson, 40 Tex. Sup. J. 131 (December 13, 1996). In the years since,\nthe need to address these issues has grown due to the statutory changes in punitive damages made by the Legislature.\n\nUndeniably, the Legislature has repeatedly acted to tightly restrict the ability of litigants to seek and recover exemplary\ndamages . Robinson respectfully requests this Court harmonize net worth discovery in cases pre-dating SB735 with the\nchanges made to punitive damages law following Lunsford.\n\nIn light of the legislative changes limiting the availability of exemplary damages, similarly limiting net worth discovery to\ncases where a finding of liability has actually been made, both plaintiffs and defendants can be protected and neither party is\nunfairly prejudiced by an unrestricted requirement to disclose sensitive, yet completely irrelevant information. Discovery of\nRobinson's net *11 worth, as well as that of similarly situated defendants, should only be permitted following a finding by\nthe trial court that there is a substantial likelihood of success on a plaintiffs claim for exemplary damages, as set out in\nSB735.\n\n\n\nC. EVEN APPLYING THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICES & REMEDIES CODE,\nNET WORTH DISCOVERY IS IMPROPER ABSENT A FINDING OF LIABILITY FOR EXEMPLARY\nDAMAGES.\n\nThis Court established a bifurcated procedure for trials involving claims for exemplary damages due to the \"very real\npotential\" that evidence of a defendant's wealth will prejudice the jury's determination of other disputed issues in tort cases.\nTransp. Inc. Co. v. Morie!, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (Tex. 1990). That procedure was later codified by the Legislature. See Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.009. Under the bifurcated procedure, evidence or mention of a defendant's net worth is\ncompletely inadmissible during the first phase of a bifurcated trial. In fact, evidence of a defendant's net worth is only\nadmissible in the second phase of a bifurcated trial following a unanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages, by\nclear and convincing evidence. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem . Code§§ 41.003; 41 .009 [emphasis added] .\n\nAs a result of these difficult evidentiary hurdles, most cases involving exemplary damages never make it to the second phase\nof trial. See In re Jacobs, 300 S.W.3d at 50 (Sullivan, J., concurring). In such cases, information concerning *12 a\ndefendant's net worth is absolutely inadmissible and the discovery thereof is not reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Additionally, the discovery of net worth information subjects defendants, such as\nRobinson, to extreme risk of prejudice, as well as unnecessary violations of privacy through disclosure of highly sensitive,\nconfidential financial information. The disclosure of such information will most likely result in a grave risk to Robinson and\n\n'//;o· tlii:.Nex:t © 2015 l homson Reuters. No ciairn to or1g1nal US.

Thus,\ninformation concerning Robinson's net worth should not be discoverable unless and until the jury finds that Robinson is\nliable to Ates for exemplary damages.\n\n\n\na. The Pre-Trial Discovery of Net Worth Evidence Exceeds the Scope of Permissible Discovery in Bifurcated Trials.\n\nIn the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the trier of fact shall determine: ( 1) liability for compensatory and exemplary damages;\nand (2) the amount of compensatory damages. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.009. If liability for exemplary damages is\nestablished during the first phase of a bifurcated trial, the trier of fact shall, in the second phase, determine the amount of\nexemplary damages to be awarded, if any. Id. The second phase is only necessary after the fact finder has found, by\nunanimous verdict, that a defendant is liable for exemplary damages. Due to the extremely prejudicial impact, a party cannot\neven mention a defendant's net worth in the first phase of a bifurcated trial. *13 Consequently, the discovery of Robinson's\nnet worth is absolutely irrelevant and inadmissible in the first phase of trial. If, and only if, a jury determines Robinson is\nliable for exemplary damages can evidence of Robinson ' s net worth be introduced during the second phase. Robinson should\nnot be required to produce evidence of its net worth unless and until the jury returns such a verdict.\n\nWhile the scope of discovery is quite broad, it is nevertheless confined by the subject matter of the case and reasonable\nexpectations ofobtaining information that will aid resolution of the dispute.

Therefore, discovery requests must be reasonably tailored to include only matters relevant to\nthe proceedings. In re Am.

The disclosure\nof Robinson's net worth is relevant only to the amount of exemplary damages that may be awarded. See Wal-Mart Stores v.\nAlexander, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. 329 {Tex. 1993) (Gonzalez, J., concurring). More importantly, in bifurcated trials, that\ninformation is not relevant during the first phase because the fact finder cannot determine the amount of exemplary damages\nto be awarded. Evidence of a defendant's net worth is only admissible, and therefore, only relevant, in the second phase\nfollowing the highly unlikely finding ofliability for exemplary damages.\n\n*14 To establish a defendant's liability for exemplary damages, a plaintiff must prove by clear and convincing evidence each\nelement of its exemplary damages claim. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code§ 41.003(b). This is a higher burden of proof than that\nrequired for mere negligence and the recovery of compensatory damages. See Al Parker Buick Co. v. Touchy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2464089\"><a href=\"/opinion/2464089/al-parker-buick-co-v-touchy/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 130 {Tex. App. - Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, no writ). Additionally, exemplary damages may only be awarded if the jury\nwas unanimous in regard to finding liability for and the amount of exemplary damages. Id. at§ 41.003(d). Thus, the question\nis not if this evidence is relevant, but when it is relevant. Lunsford, 746 S. W.2d at 4 74 (Gonzalez, J., dissenting). In most\ncases, the answer to that question is never.\n\nThe Legislative changes made following Lunsford reduced the amount of exemplary damages that could be awarded, but\nmore significantly, dramatically reduced the chances of any exemplary damage recovery. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§§ 41.001, et seq.; In re Jacobs, 300 S. W .3d at 50. As a result, discovery of a defendant's net worth is both irrelevant and\ninadmissible in most cases. The disclosure of a defendant's sensitive and confidential financial information is unwarranted\nand unnecessary unless and until a finding of liability for exemplary damages has been made. Consequently, the pre-trial\ndiscovery of such information exceeds the scope of discovery permitted under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and should\nnot be allowed. Thus, Robinson should not be *15 compelled to disclose confidential financial information unless and until a\nunanimous finding of liability for exemplary damages has been made by the jury during the trial of this cause.\n\nIf, and only if, the jury determines that a defendant is liable for exemplary damages, should a defendant be compelled to\ndisclose its net worth. That disclosure may be made by either providing bottom-line number of a defendant's total net worth,\nor by only producing evidence necessary to demonstrate its ability to satisfy an award up the maximum amount of exemplary\ndamages that may be awarded pursuant to Chapter 41.\n\n\n\nII.

See Jn re\nAm. Optical Corp., 988 S. W.2d at 714. Intrusive discovery measures - such as the unproven right to discovery of net worth\ninformation - require, at a minimum, that the benefits of the discovery measure outweigh the burden imposed upon the\ndiscovered party. See In re Prudential, 148 S. W .3d at 135-36. \"If an appellate court cannot remedy a trial court's discovery\nerror, then an adequate appellate remedy does not exist.\" In re Dana Corp., 138 S.W .3d 298, 301 (Tex. 2004). After a private\ndocument, such as that demonstrating Robinson's net worth, has been produced, inspected, and examined, a holding that the\ncourt had erroneously issued the order would be of small comfort to a relator in protecting its privacy. See Walker, 827\nS.W.2d at 843.\n\n*18 In the present case, the unnecessary discovery of Robinson's net worth constitutes an invasion of privacy and subjects\nRobinson to the potential for unfair prejudice and abuse. Once the information is disclosed, the damage to Robinson cannot\nbe undone. The benefits to unlimited discovery of such information do not outweigh the risks and burdens imposed upon\nRobinson, or other similarly situated defendants. It will be impossible to undo the harm to Robinson once the documents are\ndisclosed. Conversely, following the procedures clearly set out in SB735 in cases pre-dating its effective date, raises no risk\nof prejudice or harm to Ates, or other plaintiffs seeking exemplary damages.\n\nAn order may constitute an abuse of discretion if it compels discovery of matters not relevant to the subject matter of the\naction. In re Graco, 210 S.W.3d at 600; In re Am. Optical Corp., 988 S.W.2d at 713. Discovery of a defendant's net worth\ninformation is not relevant to the present case unless and until the trial court, following an evidentiary hearing, determines\nthat there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits of their claim for exemplary damages . Robinson\nurges this Court to adopt the requirements of the recently enacted SB735 in cases pre-dating the effective date of SB735.\n\n'1'.t\"' I \" Next \\C120 15 Thorn on Reuters No claim Lo original U.S Gow::1 rm1ent Works.                                     10\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                        MR 0779\n\fIn re ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., Relater., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5102928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015)\n\n\n\nDelaying the production of Robinson's net worth information until a finding of a substantial likelihood of success is made\nwill have no effect on the pre-trial proceedings in the present case, nor those involving similarly situated defendants.\n\n*19 The premature disclosure of Robinson's net worth information would cause irreparable and irreversible injury to\nRobinson. Once Robinson's net worth information is disclosed, the harm and prejudice resulting from that disclosure cannot\nbe undone. Conversely, there will be no harm or prejudice of any kind to Plaintiffs if the net worth information is not\nprovided absent a finding of likelihood of success.\n\nRobinson is not publicly-traded and has always been a closely-held corporation. (App. 5; R0140-0199, Exhibit \"A\").\nRobinson has always treated such financial information as carefully guarded trade-secrets. Id. The disclosure of Robinson' s\nfinancial information would gravely impair and endanger Robinson's ability to remain competitive in a highly regulated and\ncompetitive business environment. Id. As a result, Robinson is entitled to the mandamus relief requested.\n\n\n\n                                                            PRAYER\nFor the foregoing reasons, Relator, Robinson Helicopter Company, Inc. respectfully requests that this Court grant Robinson's\npetition for writ of mandamus and order Respondent to vacate its order granting Real Parties in Interest's motion to compel\nthe discovery of Robinson's net worth. Robinson further requests that this Court direct the trial court to hold a \"gatekeeper\"\nhearing to determine whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is a substantial *20 likelihood that they will succeed on the\nmerits of their claim for exemplary damages against Robinson, or alternatively, defer the discovery of net worth evidence\nuntil the conclusion of the first phase of bifurcated trial, and then only in the event the first phase jury's verdict would permit\na second phase of trial. Robinson further requests any and all other relief, in law or in equity, to which it is justly entitled.\nNone of the reliefrequested by Robinson will result in prejudice to any party in any respect.\n\n\n\nAppendix not available.\nEull of Document                                                     .,. 2015 J'hr1111s1n1 J{cutt:r:;, No claim to r>riginal U.S. Government Works .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                               4 1\n                                                                                                                                               I l\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                         MR 0780\n\fIN RE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC., 15-0604 (2015)\n\n\n\n\n            TO ORDER COPIES OF ANY DOCUMENTS LISTED BELOW, CALL WESTLAW\n                                     COURTEXPRESS\n                  1-877-DOC-RETR (1-877-362-7387) (Additional Charges Apply)\n\n                           This docket is current through 10/18/2015\n\nCurrent Date: 10/26/2015\nSource:        SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS, TEXAS\nCASE INFORMATION\nCase Title:                         IN RE ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC.\n\nCourt:                              SUPREME COURT OF TEXAS\n\nCase Number:                        15-0604\n\nCase Type:                          APPEALS\n\nCase Subtype:                       PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS\n\nKey Nature of Suit:                 CIVIL PROCEDURE; PETITION (100.55)\n\nDate Filed:                         08/12/2015\n\n\n\n\nLOWER COURT INFORMATION\nTrial Court:                        11TH DISTRICT COURT\n\nTrial Court County:                 HARRIS\n\nTrial Court Judge:                  MICHAEL DAVID MILLER\n\nTrial Court Case Number:            2014-34635\n\n\n\n\nPARTICIPANT INFORMATION\n!ROBINSON HELICOPTER COMPANY, INC.\nType:                               RELATOR\n\nAttorney:                           CARRIE M.

Plaintiffs have no interest in deposing any\n\nlawyers or attorneys of record. Michelin's justification for not producing an employee most\n\nknowledgeable about its responses to Plaintiffs' Requests for Production is In re Exxon Corp.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1762015\"><a href=\"/opinion/1762015/in-re-exxon-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76 (Tex. App. 2006). Exxon has nothing to do with the present circumstances.\n\nIn Exxon, the plaintiffs sought to depose \"one of Exxon's attorneys\":\n\n      It cannot reasonably be argued in this Court that the anticipated deponent is\n      not one of Exxon's attorneys. During the June hearing, plaintiffs' counsel\n      informed the trial court that he suspected the knowledgeable representative was\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\n\n\n                                                                                            MR 0785\n\f        indeed an Exxon lawyer and Exxon confirmed with the trial court that counsel\n        responded to the requests for production.\n\nId. (e.a.).\n\n        While the trial court compelled the discovery deposition of the attorney involved in the\nlitigation, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed, holding that \"[c]ompelling an attorney of record\ninvolved in the litigation of the case ... implicates work product concerns and is inappropriate\":\n\n        Compelling an attorney of record involved in the litigation of the case to\n        testify concerning the suit's subject matter generally implicates work product\n        concerns and is inappropriate under most circumstances.\n                                              *****\n       This inquiry is designed to inquire into mental processes of counsel and is not\n       reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\n\nId. (e.a.).\n\n        Again, here, Plaintiffs have no interest in deposing any lawyers, attorneys of record and\n\ndiscovering the mental processes of counsel concerning this issue.   What Plaintiffs want and are\n\nentitled to depose is the Michelin employee or employees - not lawyer or attorney - most\n\nknowledgeable about Michelin's responsive documents to Plaintiffs' Request for Production.\n\nSuch folks include but are not limited to the tire builders, tire designers, tire verifiers,\n\nclassspectors, return center personnel, tire adjustment data employees, etc., etc. For example, in\n\nresponse to Plaintiffs' Request for all aspect specifications, Michelin claimed that only nine (9)\n\naspect specifications apply to the components and conditions at issue.          Only a Michelin\n\nemployee who uses the aspect specifications daily within a Michelin production plant- not an\n\nattorney - can determine which aspect specifications correspond to specific conditions.\n\nTherefore, Plaintiffs' Motion should be granted.\n\nII. In cases like this where \"punitive or exemplary damages may be awarded, parties may\n    discover and offer evidence of a defendant's net worth.\" Lunsford v.

(e.a.).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0786\n\f        To date, there is overwhelming evidence of manufacturing and design defects in the\n\nsubject tire- all known to Michelin before, during and after the tire was manufactured. Michelin\n\nprovides no evidence disputing such.        See Plaintiff's Original Petition and Objection to\n\nMichelin's Renewed Designation re: Adrian and Maria Rico.           Therefore, this case reeks of\n\npunitive damages.\n\n       Still, Michelin's reliance on Section 41.0115 of the Texas Civil Practice & Civil\n\nRemedies Code is misleading. As Michelin concedes, said statute does not apply to cases\n\nthat were filed prior to September 1, 2015. On the contrary, binding Texas law requires and\n\nauthorizes discovery of a defendant like Michelin's net worth when a plaintiff, like here, seeks\n\npunitive damages:\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court has held that in cases in which punitive or exemplary\n       damages may be awarded, parties may discover and offer evidence of a\n       defendant's net worth. [Citation omitted].\n\n      The court declared a defendant's net worth to be \"relevant\" in a suit involving\n      exemplary damages. Id. Miller seeks punitive damages, which are recoverable\n      for a willful breach of a fiduciary duty . . . Thus, documents showing the net\n      wo1ih of Gann and Perdue are relevant and discoverable.\n\nMiller v. O'Neill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455271\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455271/miller-v-oneill/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (Tex. App. 1989). (e.a.).\n\n       Michelin's only argument is to have this Court \"delay\" its ruling and discovery and\n\nconsequently continue trial, which would directly violate an express order of this Court:\n\n      Judge want to let you all know that ... there will be no more continuances.\n\nE-Mail from Francine Ly, Judge Dale Tillery's 1341'1 Court Coordinator, Exhibit A. (e.a.).\n\nConclusion: Pursuant to binding Texas precedent, Plaintiffs are entitled to: 1) depose Michelin's\n\nemployee or employees - not lawyers or attorneys - about Michelin's responses to Plaintiffs'\n\nRequest for Production and 2) conduct discovery about Michelin's net worth including the\n\ndeposition of its employee most knowledgeable about these matters.\n\n\n                                                3\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0787\n\f                                          Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n                                            LAW OFFICES OF LUIS P.

No tires in the relevant scope were manufactured\n\nwith nylon cap plies. MNA objects to this request as being vague and ambiguous in its use of the\n\nterm \"nylon cap pules\" and \"similar tires,\" as those tem1s are undefined.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the relevant scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\narc neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action.\n\nTHIRD SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:\n\n          After a reasonable and diligent search, MNA has not located any documents responsive\n\nto this request for tires in the expanded scope.          No tires in the expanded scope were\n\nmanufactured with nylon cap plies. MNA objects to this request as being vague and ambiguous\n\nin its use of the term \"nylon cap pules\" and \"similar tires,\" as those terms arc undefined.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the expanded scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\nare neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire, plant, and time period relevant to this action.\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 19:\n\n        Identify and produce any and all documents, relating to the building, tire builder training,\ntesting, and inspection of passenger and light truck tires at the Dothan, Alabama plant where the\n\n                                                23\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0797\n\fsubject tire was manufactured. This request includes, but is not limited to standard practice\nbinders, tire building mmrnals, tire builder training manuals, equipment manuals, and/or other\nmaterials and videotapes used to train tire builders. This request also includes documents,\nphotographs, and charts used to illustrate defects, or potential defects, in tires and/or problems or\npotential problems in the tire building process.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n          MNA objects to this request because plaintiffs have not identified the specific design or\n\nmanufacturing process that produced the defect alleged to be present in the tire in question.\n\nAccordingly, this request is nothing more than an impermissible \"fishing expedition\" for\n\ninformation generally related to every aspect of MNA's design and manufacturing process,\n\nwhether or not related to plaintiffs' claims in this case. If plaintiffs will identify the components\n\nand processes at issue in this case, MNA will search for and produce documents responsive to\n\nthis request for those components and processes during the relevant scope, if they exist.\n\n          To the extent this request seeks documents outside the relevant scope, MNA further\n\nobjects to this request because it is overly broad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents that\n\nare neither relevant to the subject matter of this case nor reasonably calculated to lead to the\n\ndiscovery of admissible evidence. Plaintiffs have failed to limit the scope of this request to the\n\ntire and time period relevant to this action.\n\n          MNA further objects to the extent this request seeks or attempts to seek information that\n\nconstitutes commercially sensitive, confidential business infonnation of MNA. Pursuant to Rule\n\n507 of the Texas Rules of Evidence, MNA asserts trade secret protection for such information.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSE:\n\n          MNA incorporates its objections above in its original response.           Subject to the\n\nconfidentiality protective order entered in this case, MNA produces MNA-MEDINA-0001287 -\n\nMNA-MEDINA-0001312 and MNA-MEDINA-0001815 - MNA-MEDINA-0001820 for the\n\nrelevant scope or the oldest available for the components and processes identified by plaintiffs.\n\n                                                24\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   MR 0798\n\fMNA has located no additional responsive documents for the relevant scope for the components\n\nand processes identified by plaintiffs.\n\nTHIRD SUPPLEMENT AL RESPONSE:\n\n          MNA incorporates its objections above in its original response.          Subject to the\n\nconfidentiality protective order entered in this case, on September 11, 2015 MNA produced\n\nMNA-MEDINA-0003362 - MNA-MEDINA0003515, the oldest documents available for the\n\nexpanded scope for the components and processes identified by plaintiffs. MNA has located no\n\nadditional responsive documents for the expanded scope for the components and processes\n\nidentified by plaintiffs.\n\nREQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 20:\n\n        Identify and produce any audits, reports, examinations, investigations, studies, or\nreviews, including any work papers, whether created within or outside Michelin North America,\nin any manner related to the return, failure, performance, durability, and life expectancy, design,\nor quality of the subject tire and model tires.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\n          MNA produces claims fom1s for the model of the tire in question manufactured at Dothan\n\nduring the relevant scope as MNA-MEDINA-0000011 - MNA-MEDINA-0000130, MNA-\n\nMEDINA-0000260 - MNA-MEDINA-0000563, and MNA-MEDINA-0000231. Upon entry of\n\nan appropriate confidentiality protective order, MNA will search for and produce claim forms for\n\nthe tires common green to the tire in question manufactured at Dothan during the relevant scope.\n\nAlso upon entry of an appropriate confidentiality protective order, MNA will produce a list of\n\nadjustment codes. To the extent plaintiffs identify codes relevant to the condition of the tire in\n\nquestion and plaintiffs' claims in this matter, MNA will produce documents reflecting the\n\nnumber of tires in the relevant scope returned with those conditions, if any.\n\n\n\n\n                                              25\n4540175\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0799\n\f                                                                               AUSTIN BEAUMONT HOUSTON\n                                                                                            WWW germer.com\n\n                                                                                    THOMAS M.

He\n\nlost control of the vehicle, it rolled over, and the plaintiff occupants were injured. Mr. Rico had\n\npurchased the Expedition approximately two months before the accident and had not checked or\n\nchanged the tires. In fact, the vehicle had mis-matched tires of varying sizes, some of which were\n\npassenger tires, and one was a light truck tire. The tire at issue is a passenger tire, a P255/70R 16\n\nLTX M/S manufactured at MNA’s Dothan, Alabama plant during the 31st week of 2001. At the\n\ntime of the accident, it was over eleven years old and should not have been in service.\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 1\n                                                                                                        MR 0811\n\f          Plaintiffs moved to compel certain documents from MNA and multiple oral hearings\n\nwere held on September 8, October 5, and November 3, 2015 on the following motions, among\n\nothers:\n\n              •   Plaintiffs’ Amended Motion to Compel Michelin to Respond to Discovery and\n                  Identification of Withheld Michelin Documents, and\n\n              •   Plaintiffs’ Short Motion to Compel Michelin’s Employee Most Knowledgeable\n                  about: 1) Michelin’s Discovery Reponses and 2) Financial Information of\n                  Michelin North America (MNA).\n\n          In an Order dated November 11, 2015, this Court signed plaintiffs’ proposed order on\n\ntheir Motion to Compel Michelin to Respond to Discovery, and required that confidential, trade\n\nsecret aspect specifications be produced on or before November 24, 2015. The Court also\n\nexpanded the scope of discovery to dissimilar tires from the tire at issue. The Court has not yet\n\nsigned an order on the second motion listed above regarding “discovery on discovery” or on\n\nMNA’s financial information.       Although certain rulings were made from the bench at the\n\nNovember 3 hearing, the hearing transcript has not yet been provided by the court reporter.\n\n                                             II.\n                         MNA’s Aspect Specifications are Trade Secret\n\n          The November 11 Order compels MNA to produce “the oldest version of all aspect\n\nspecifications.” The Order is expansive in that it is not limited to the Dothan plant, where the\n\ntire at issue was manufactured, nor is it related to plaintiffs’ specific defect theories. The aspect\n\nspecifications regarding the tire defects that plaintiffs allege in this case have been voluntarily\n\nproduced by MNA in an attempt at compromise, but plaintiffs insist that they need all of such\n\nproprietary documents, even on unrelated defects. All such aspect specifications were proven up\n\nas trade secret in the Affidavit of Vaneaton Price where he testified:\n\n          Certain of Plaintiffs’ requests seek MNA’s design and manufacturing\n          specifications, specification changes, testing and design related documents,\n          research and development, tire adjustment processes and analysis, internal\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 2\n\n                                                                                               MR 0812\n\f       research and studies, proprietary manufacturing and inspection processes and\n       procedures, and tire production information. All such documents are highly\n       protected trade secrets of MNA.\n\n(V. Price Aff., ¶ 43, emphasis added)         Additionally, Mr. Price testified by affidavit that\n\n“Plaintiffs have also requested information and documents relating to MNA’s manufacturing and\n\nquality procedures,” and he described the trade secret nature of such documents, the steps taken\n\nby MNA to protect their secrecy, and the competitive disadvantage to MNA from disclosure. Id.\n\nat ¶¶ 55-60.\n\n       This affidavit testimony encompasses the “aspect specifications” ordered to be produced\n\nin the November 11 Order. They fall within “MNA’s proprietary inspection processes and\n\nprocedures” and “quality procedures” referenced in the affidavit quoted above. To explain\n\nfurther, “aspect specifications” are procedures by which MNA classpectors inspect finished tires\n\npursuant to certain quality assurance protocols to look for certain characteristics in the tires after\n\nthey have been cured. Thus, they are part of the proprietary quality assurance systems and\n\nprocesses developed by MNA. There are hundreds of aspect specifications. MNA has clarified\n\nthis point in the Supplemental Affidavit of Vaneaton Price attached hereto as Exhibit A. The\n\nNovember 11 Order requires such production of these confidential trade secrets of MNA.\n\n       This Court allowed plaintiffs to depose Mr. Price about his affidavit and his deposition\n\nwas recently taken. He explained that MNA’s aspect specifications are marked “D3” indicating\n\nconfidential documents within MNA that are not allowed outside the company. (Depo. at 79-80)\n\nPlaintiffs counsel repeatedly chastised Mr. Price for MNA’s “thought-out, premeditated actions\n\nto protect its secrets” and for “keeping information secret and away from the public,” including\n\nplaintiffs who their counsel described as “just common folk, and that’s common folk that is\n\nasking for these documents, not competitors. And you guys intentionally, Michelin intentionally\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 3\n\n                                                                                                 MR 0813\n\fkeeps all this information from these folks, right?” (Depo. at 97) Mr. Price explained that trade\n\nsecret documents are proprietary and not disclosed to the public. Id. at 98.\n\n       Because aspect specifications were proven to be MNA’s highly protected trade secrets,\n\nthe burden then shifted to plaintiffs to show that such documents were “necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of their case” under In re Continental General Tire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2416508\"><a href=\"/opinion/2416508/in-re-continental-general-tire-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1998)\n\nand In re Bridgestone/Firestone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635307/in-re-bridgestonefirestone-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).

App. – Dallas 2010, orig. proc.), the Court granted\n\nmandamus and protected as trade secrets Goodyear’s quality control information and quality\n\nassurance systems.\n\n       Consequently, MNA seeks reconsideration of the ruling requiring production of all aspect\n\nspecifications, even those unrelated to plaintiffs’ specific defect theories. MNA also respectfully\n\nrequests a stay of the November 24 production date for aspect specifications so that it may\n\npursue mandamus on production of these trade secret documents.\n\n                                            III.\n                     Scope of Production Expanded to Non-Similar Tires\n\n       Additionally, the November 11 Order set the initial scope for discovery as the three\n\ncommon green tires of the tire at issue manufactured at the Dothan plant for 5 years, from 1998-\n\n2003. MNA has already provided documents to plaintiffs under this agreed upon scope, which\n\nare substantially similar tires. Dissatisfied, plaintiffs sought an even broader scope in their\n\nproposed order ultimately signed by this Court. By the November 11 Order, the scope has now\n\nbeen expanded to tire sizes and configurations which are different designs from the tire in\n\nquestion in this case, other than sharing the same brand name “LTX M/S.”\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR CLARIFICATION AND FOR STAY – PAGE 4\n\n                                                                                             MR 0814\n\f       MNA has already responded to a host of document requests related to the tire in question\n\nand all substantially similar tires. Yet the scope now expansively encompasses all documents\n\nrelated to three additional size LTX M/S tires – the 235, 245, and 265 LTX M/S – plus all size\n\n255 tires, without regard to rim diameter, section width, load range, components, number of\n\nplies, types of plies, speed ratings, tread depth, or original equipment versus replacement tire\n\nprogram. MNA explained that “LTX M/S” is simply a marketing label, and not a designation by\n\nwhich substantial similarity can be defined. (Price Aff. at ¶17) Including various sizes of tires\n\nas substantially similar ignores critical differences which make the tire at issue different from\n\nother tires. (Id. at §20-27)    The type and size of many individual components vary\n\nsignificantly, including different thicknesses of shoulder areas of the tread, tread widths,\n\ndifferent top and bottom belt widths, belt gauges, tread compounds, other rubber formulas\n\nand many other items. Id. Further, the November 11 Order requires the scope for these four tire\n\nsizes to include all MNA manufacturing plants, not just the Dothan plant where the tire at issue\n\nwas manufactured.\n\n       Texas law does not permit discovery regarding products that the plaintiff did not use.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court has granted mandamus relief to several product-liability defendants\n\n“when a discovery order covered products the plaintiff never used.” In re Graco Children’s\n\nProds., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894793\"><a href=\"/opinion/894793/in-re-graco-childrens-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600-01 (Tex. 2006) (holding alleged defect in harness clip of\n\nbaby’s car seat did not support production of other allegedly defective products that did not\n\ninclude harnesses) (citing In re American Optical Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425006\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425006/in-re-american-optical-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (Tex. 1998)\n\n(holding that discovery order that included all respiratory products manufactured by defendant\n\nwas too broad because it included respiratory equipment plaintiffs never alleged they used);\n\nTexaco, Inc. v.

A federal\n\nregulation defines substantial similarity for tires sold outside the United States compared to\n\ntires sold in the United States as: “the same size, speed rating, load index, load range, number\n\nof plies and belts, and similar ply and belt construction and materials, placement of\n\ncomponents, and component materials, irrespective of plant of manufacture or tire line.” 49\n\nCFR 579.4 (d)(3).\n\n       In tire litigation, courts have limited the scope of discovery to tires made from the same\n\nspecification, at the same plant, and in the same time period as the tire at issue:\n\n   •   Johnson v.

Plaintiff argued “that ‘similar tires’ would be tires that utilize the\n       same skim stock, wedge material, inner liner, and/or (AO) package as the accident tire,”\n       while Hankook argued that only tires sharing a common green were similar tires. Id. at\n       *2. The court observed that 49 C.F.R. § 579.4 defines green tires as “tires that are\n       produced to the same internal specification but that have, or may have, different external\n       characteristics and may be sold under different tire line names.” Id. Noting that “how a\n       particular component performs in a tire is totally dependent upon all of the other\n       components in a tire and how they work together per their specifications,” the court\n       concluded that “[c]omparing tires that do not share common green internal specifications\n       as defined by the CFR is, therefore, useless to the trier of fact.” Id. The court thus\n       limited Plaintiff’s discovery requests to “the subject model and size tire and any tire that\n       shares a common green internal specification as opposed to any tire that might share a\n       generic component.” Id.\n\n   •   Alvarez v.

They moved to compel\n\nKumho Tire to produce certain documents regarding “the entire ‘Kumho Road Venture line\n\nof tires.’” Id. at *3.

(\"MNA\"), competently testify as follows:\n\n      I. This affidavit is based on my personal knowledge and my review of information\n\n         available to me in my role at MNA. I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n         competent to execute this Affidavit. This supplements my Affidavit filed September 1,\n\n         2105.\n\n      2. I have never been convicted of a felony or a crime of moral turpitude.\n\n      3. I am a Senior Technical Advisor employed by MNA. I was employed with Michelin\n\n         Americas Research and Development Corporation (\"MARC\"), which merged with and\n\n         became a division of MNA on January 1, 2008, from January 2007 to December 2011.\n\n         Since May 1999, I have been employed by MNA. During my employment with MNA\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             MR 0822\n\f       and MARC, I have become familiar with the tires that are designed by MARC and\n\n       manufactured by MNA, as well as the design and manufacturing procedures used.\n\n   4. I am familiar with the process by which tire specifications are developed, with the\n\n       composition and dimensions of certain tires MNA has designed and manufactured during\n\n       my employment, with MNA manufacturing processes, equipment, and quality assurance\n\n       procedures, and with the efforts that MNA makes to protect its proprietary and trade\n\n       secret information.\n\n   5. Certain of Plaintiffs' requests seek MNA's design and manufacturing specifications,\n\n       specification changes, testing and design-related documents, research and development,\n\n       tire adjustment processes and analysis, intemal research and studies, propriety\n\n       manufacturing and inspection processes and procedures, and tire production information.\n\n       Plaintiffs also request all of MNA's Aspect Specifications which are used to inspect a\n\n       finished tire following quality assurance protocols to look for certain characteristics in the\n\n       tire after it is manufactured. There are hundreds of aspect specifications. They are part of\n\n       an extensive quality assurance process developed internally by MNA based on years of\n\n       experience and extensive testing and analysis.     All such documents are highly protected\n\n       trade secrets of MNA and kept secret by MNA under the steps outlined in my September\n\n       1, 2015 affidavit.\n\n   6. Tire builder and other employees in MNA's manufacturing plants receive extensive\n\n       training to perform their jobs. They are trained on the processes and procedures and\n\n       MNA's quality standards. These training programs are developed intemally at MNA and\n\n       are based on the equipment and procedures in each individual plant at a given time.\n\n       These training materials contain the confidential manufacturing and quality procedures\n\n\n\n\nSUPPLEJ\\IENTAL AFFIDAVIT OF VANEATON PHICE, III-PAGE 2\n\n\n\n\n

Texas Discovery Standard.\n\n         The Supreme Court of Texas holds that the purpose of discovery is \"to seek truth, so that\n\ndisputes may be decided by those facts that are revealed, rather than concealed.\" Axelson, Inc,\n\n798 S.W.2d at 555. Therefore, \"[d]iscovery is ... the linchpin of the search for truth. State, 802\n\nS.W.2d at 671. Discovery also makes trial a \"fair contest with the issues and facts disclosed to\n\nthe fullest practicable extent.\"   United States v, 356 U.S. at 682, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105703\"><a href=\"/opinion/105703/united-states-v-procter-gamble-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Very limited exceptions to the strongly prefened policy of openness\n      are recognized in our state procedural rules and statutes.\n\nState, 802 S.W.2d at 671. See Tex.R.Civ.Evid. 501; Tex.R.Civ.P. 166b(3).\n\n         Thus, \"the burden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for\n\nexemption or immunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim\" by providing evidence -\n\nnot legally insufficient conclusory allegations, without personal knowledge - to the trial court to\n\nestablish the claimed privilege:\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\n\n\n                                                                                                MR 0834\n\f       The burden is on the party seeking to avoid discovery to plead the basis for exemption\n       or immunity and to produce evidence supporting that claim. [citation omitted].\n\n       This means a party should provide evidence to the trial court in the form of affidavits or\n       testimony to establish the claimed privilege.\n\nState, 802 S.W.2d at 671. (e.a.).\n\n          That was Michelin's burden, and it failed to meet it. The sworn admissions made by its\n\naffiant Price at his deposition revealed his lack of personal knowledge of the contents in his\n\naffidavit. Hence, such affidavit in support of the alleged \"privilege\" is wmihless because it is\n\n\"legally invalid and therefore cannot serve as evidence in support of a claim of'' trade secrets.\n\nHumphreys, 888 S.W.2d at 470-71. Moreover, Michelin's argument of concealing every internal\n\ndocument by simply claiming \"trade secrets\" has also been soundly rejected:\n\n       Lowe's has cited no authority that a party's (or even expert's) conclusory opinion that\n       information is a trade secret or is not used industry-wide, or a party's mere desire to avoid\n       disclosing information to others, is sufficient to establish the privilege. Nor would there\n       appear to be any rationale for adopting such a position as it would seemingly allow the\n       privilege to extend to almost any internal company records.\n\n       Without evidence establishing any of the conventional trade secret factors with regard\n       to the database, Lowe's has failed to demonstrate that the trial court erred in\n       overruling its trade secret objection to providing deposition testimony on the creation and\n       use of the database. Accordingly, Lowe's first issue is ove1rnled.\n\nIn re Lowe's Companies, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1423329\"><a href=\"/opinion/1423329/in-re-lowes-companies-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 879 (Tex.

It is not a warning to the effect that if you don't do what it says, a tire may fall\n                 apart?\n        A.       No. It is not a warning.\n                                                      ******\n        Q.       Since your Technical Bulletin is not a warning, you warn no one of anything?\n        A.

See Amended Motion to Compel dated August 25 at pp. 6-10. With a few\n\nexceptions, Michelin refused disclosure by wholesale claiming \"trade secrets\" in response to\n\nmore than twenty-five (25) of Plaintiffs' requests for production. However, Michelin provided\n\nno evidence 6 supporting its objection to producing the requested documents about the design,\n\ntesting, manufacture, building, and inspection of the subject LTX MIS. Id. Despite repeated\n\nassurances 7 that the requested documentation would be produced once Plaintiffs executed\n\n\n\n6\n As Plaintiffs' counsel pointed out to the Co mt, Michelin got Plaintiffs' requests in April and did not provide fil!Y\nevidence establishing that the information constituted trade secrets:\n\n         MR.

The September 8, 2015 Hearing.\n\n        At the September 8, 2015 concerning Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel, to justify its\n\nabsconding of evidence, Michelin relied exclusively on the affidavit of Vaneaton Price - an\n\naffidavit8 which Michelin knew did not pass muster.                   In Texas, to testify about privileged\n\ninformation the affiant must have personal knowledge of it.

As explained, Price\n\nworks in Michelin's legal department. He is not a tire builder, or a tire manufacturer, or a tire\n\ndesigner, or a tire project manager, or a tire manufacturer, or a skim stock compounder, or a tire\n\ninspector, or an adjustment inspector, and therefore did not have personal knowledge or\n\ncompetence to testify that the infmmation requested constituted trade secrets:\n\n        He works on the litigation Defendant sic [department] of Michelin . . . And\n        going back to the affidavit ... [he's] not a tire builder, not a tire manufacturer .\n        . . not a tire designer; didn't design this tire; was not a project manager;\n        didn't work on the plant.\n\nSeptember 8, 2015 Transcript from Plaintiffs' Motion to Compel Hearing at 30:23 - 32:2. (e.a.).\n\n\n\n\n                 We are working on the production and still anticipate malting it within 10-14\n                 days of entry of the protective order as originally estimated.\n\nE-Mailfiwn Nelson Mullins, counsel for MNA, June 4, 2015, Exhibit E to Plaintiffs' August 25, 2015 Amended\nMotion to Compel.\n\n8\n Strangely, Michelin used Mr. Price's affidavit as both a sword and a shield. Michelin used the affidavit to prevent\ndisclosure of discoverable evidence but then refused to allow Plaintiffs' to cross-examine him about the affidavit\nand his personal knowledge of the contents of such affidavit. The Honorable Court ovenuled Michelin's objection\nand ordered Mr. Price's deposition, which was conducted on October 22, 2015.\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                MR 0839\n\f            Accordingly, there was never a finding by the Court that Michelin established trade\n\nsecrets.\n\n              a. The Court's Ruling severely narrowed the discovery allowed.\n\n            Since by law Plaintiffs are entitled to conduct discovery about 1) \"evidence of incidents\n\ninvolving other products besides the exact model at issue\" In re Exmark Mfg. Co., Inc., 299\n\nS.W.3d at 528 and also 2) the multitude of components and conditions the parties have alleged\n\nare at issue (Plaintiffs: over-age rnbber stock, liner pattern marks, thin inner liner, premature\n\noxidation on the belt skin, improper splicing of belts, improper spacing and placement of the\n\nsteel cords and belts, improper inspection and/or repair of the tire at the factory, lack of nylon\n\noverlay/nylon cap ply or safety, air migration through the inner liner, aging of the tire and its\n\ncomponents, trapped air or steam inside the tire components, aging and/or contamination of pre-\n\ncured rnbber and rnbber coated tire components, and misplacement of the steel belts;\n\nDefendants: overdeflection, underinflation, impact damage), the Honorable Court:\n\n       1. Severely narrowed9 the scope of discovery requested by Plaintiffs (Transcript at 42:10-\n          12; 45:5-6).     .\n\n                    First, the Court nalTowed the other tire widths to only 235, 245 and 265 -\n                    far from what Plaintiffs requested. Second, the Court nalTowed the scope\n                    to make sure that such tires were the same type of tire - P-Metric tires as\n                    opposed to also light trnck tires (Transcript at 45:8-12). Third, the Court\n                    drastically reduced the time scope from Plaintiffs' request (tires made from\n                    the start of the manufacture of the LTX MIS to the end of production) to a\n                    very nalTOW scope of production: \"six months before and the year after.\"\n                     (Transcript at 58: 12-13). Therefore, if any party should be complaining\n                    about the scope of production, it should be Plaintiffs.\n\n       2. Ordered production of \"the oldest version\" of its Aspect Specifications 10 . (Transcript at\n          59:11).\n9\n    Therefore, if any party should be complaining about the scope of production, it should be Plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n                                                             8\n\n\n\n                                                                                                            MR 0840\n\fVI.         Price's deposition\n\n            The Court's ruling was crystal clear 11 .          Still, Michelin sat and never produced the\n\ndocuments in compliance with its strategy of delay and stonewalling. So, Plaintiffs deposed\n\nPrice to further expose Michelin's fictitious claim of trade secrets.                           Aware of Price's\n\nshortcomings, but still using him as a sword to claim \"trade secrets,'' Michelin tried to shield his\n\ncross-examination and refused to produce Price for deposition. More delay. More stonewalling.\n\nSo, Plaintiffs were forced to file a Motion to Compel - which was granted.\n\n           Deeply worried about Price's lack of personal knowledge about his affidavit's contents,\n\nMichelin contacted and retained an army of attorneys from across the country to prepare him for\n\ndeposition: 1) Kate Helm, (from Atlanta, Georgia); 2) Michael Wiggins, (from Orlando, Florida);\n\n3) Danean Sturino, (from Chicago, Illinois); 4) Tom Bullion, (from Austin, Texas); and 5) Nicole\n\nBuntin, (from Greenville, South Carolina). 12 These attorneys spent a minimum of seven (7)\n\nhours and some up to several days preparing the unqualified Price for his deposition. It did not\n\nhelp       Michelin.         Thus,    it 1s     no     surprise that     Michelin -         m    its   Motion      for\n\nReconsideration/Clarification/Stay - omitted the hundreds of admissions that Price made under\n\noath that exposed his lack of personal knowledge about the contents of his affidavit:\n\n10\n     Aspect Specifications/Aspect Specification Repertoire/Aspect Specification Annexes - are the actual\nmanufacturing/quality control information/laser photographs that the tire inspectors use when they are looking for\ndefects/anomalies/abnormal conditions (blisters, abnormal coloring, molding, cord/cable placement, improper\ncreases, folds, and openings, mold or curing issues, foreign material found in the tire and other various conditions)\nfound after the tire is manufactured but before it leaves the factory for distribution. The aspect specifications also\nprovide a decision tree on what the inspector/verifier should do when a specific defect is found (repair, scrap, etc.).\n\nThus, these documents are necessary for Plaintiffs to prove their case so they can show that the\ndefects/conditions/components alleged by Plaintiffs or the conditions that Michelin claim were caused by the tire's\nwear and tear left the factory that way.\n\n11\n  Michelin claims the Court did not rule until November 11. Wrong. The Court ordered production of all of these\ndocuments back on September 8, 2015. Michelin sat on this for months and on the eve of its deadline to produce the\ndocuments, seeks reconsideration and a stay. It should not be permitted.\n\n12\n     Deposition ofMr. Price at pp. 22-27, Exhibit A.\n\n\n\n                                                           9\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   MR 0841\n\f            1.

First, the Comi narrowed the other tire widths to\n\nonly 235, 245 and 265 - far from what Plaintiffs requested. Second, the Court narrowed the\n\nscope to make sure that such tires were the same type of tire -P-Metric tires as opposed to also\n\nlight truck tires (Transcript at 45:8-12).

(“MNA”) files this Motion for Stay of\n\nDisclosure of Financial Information ordered to be produced under the Order re: November 3,\n\n2015 Hearing, and Supplement to Response Opposing Disclosure of Financial Information, and\n\nrespectfully shows as follows:\n\nI.     Introduction\n\n       On November 21, 2015, this Court signed an order entitled “ORDER re: November 3,\n\n2015 Hearing” (“Nov. 21 Order”) requiring MNA to “produce a Corporate Representative to\n\ntestify about the financial condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements of Michelin North\n\nAmerica, Inc.” MNA files this Supplement to its October 30, 2015 Response to Plaintiffs’ Short\n\nMotion re: Michelin Employee with Most Knowledge about Financial Information, and objects\n\nto such required disclosure as this information is highly confidential, trade secret information, as\n\nevidenced by the affidavit of Marcel Chabot (attached as Exhibit A).\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 1\n                                                                                                       MR 0901\n\f       After the hearing, a deposition notice was issued by Plaintiffs for a Corporate\n\nRepresentative to testify about “the financial condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements\n\nof Michelin North America, Inc. (attached as Exhibit B). A “request for production” was\n\nincluded with the deposition notice seeking “Financial statements of Defendant Michelin North\n\nAmerica, Inc. from 1998 to 2014,” thus seeking an incredibly expansive production of fourteen\n\nyears of financial statements. Such information is clearly sought as a litigation strategy for\n\npurposes of harassment and should not be allowed by this Court.\n\n       At the November 3, 2015 hearing, this Court orally ordered that the deposition on MNA’s\n\nfinancials be taken, but “if [MNA] choses to seek the writ of mandamus, I will stay the discovery\n\non the net worth while you do that.” (Hearing at 32). Consequently, MNA requests a stay of the\n\nNov. 21 Order regarding MNA’s financial information, and also requests this Court to defer\n\ndiscovery on MNA’s net worth until the second phase of the bifurcated trial.\n\nII.    MNA’s Financial Information is Highly Confidential, Trade Secret, and\n       Unnecessary to Plaintiffs’ Case at this Juncture.\n\n       MNA demonstrated in its Response filed on October 30, 2015 that its financial\n\ninformation is highly sensitive and confidential, and “disclosure of such information will result\n\nin a grave risk to MNA and endanger MNA’s ability to remain financially competitive in a\n\nhighly competitive business environment.” Response at 6. This position is supported by the\n\naffidavit of Marcel Chabot, which further states that MNA is not a publicly-traded company, and\n\ntherefore MNA does not make public SEC disclosures regarding its net worth, financial\n\ncondition, nor does MNA publish its financial statements. Aff. ¶ 3. MNA is a subsidiary of its\n\nultimate parent company, Compagnie Generale Des Establissements Michelin (“CGEM”), a\n\nFrench corporation that is publicly traded on the Paris Stock Exchange. For accounting purposes,\n\nMNA’s financial position is fully consolidated with CGEM’s financial position, and CGEM’s\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 2\n\n                                                                                             MR 0902\n\fpublic filings reflect an overall picture of the Michelin Group of companies, and do not reflect\n\ninformation on MNA’s specific financial information. Id. Therefore, MNA’s financial\n\ninformation is not known outside of those individuals at MNA or within the Michelin Group who\n\nhave a business need to know, and it cannot easily be obtained. Id.\n\n        Mr. Charbot’s affidavit also proves that MNA “considers its financial information highly\n\nconfidential and vitally sensitive, and treats this information as a carefully guarded trade secret.”\n\nId. ¶ 4. MNA takes extreme care to protect its financial information from disclosure. Id. ¶ 6. If\n\ndisclosed, such information could seriously endanger MNA’s ability to remain financially\n\ncompetitive in the highly competitive tire industry. Id. ¶ 7.\n\n        Texas law recognizes financial information trade secret under the Texas Uniform Trade\n\nSecrets Act:\n\n        “Trade Secret” means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation,\n        program, device, method, technique, process, financial data, or list of actual or\n        potential customer or suppliers that:\n\n        (A) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being\n        generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by, other persons who can\n        obtain economic value from its disclosure or use; and\n\n\n        (B) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to\n        maintain its secrecy.\n\nTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 134A.002(6) (emphasis added).\n\n        The financial data requested by Plaintiffs clearly meets this statutory definition of\n\nprotected trade secrets. 1 MNA’s financial information, including its “financial condition, wealth,\n\n\n1\n   MNA’s financial information also meets the factors for trade secret under the Restatement of Torts § 757: (1) the\nextent to which the information is known outside of the owner’s business; (2) the extent to which the information is\nknown by employees and others involved in the business; (3) the extent of measures taken by the owner to guard the\ninformation’s secrecy; (4) the value of the information to the owner and the owner’s competitors; (5) the amount of\neffort or money expended by the owner in developing the information; and (6) the ease or difficulty with which the\ninformation could properly be acquired or duplicated by others. The Affidavit of Marcel Charbot proves all of these\nfactors. See Aff. ¶¶ 3-7.\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 3\n\n                                                                                                              MR 0903\n\fassets, and financial statements” required to be disclosed under the Nov. 21 Order, has great\n\neconomic value in not being known because otherwise competitors could use this information to\n\ninfer, calculate, estimate, and deduce highly confidential information about MNA’s corporate\n\nstrategies, financial condition, research and development capabilities and options, and other such\n\nvital aspects of its corporate objectives, plans, governance, and management. Aff. ¶ 5.\n\nCompetitors could then use this information to develop a competitive edge against MNA and\n\ngravely impair MNA’s ability to remain competitive. Id. MNA takes “extreme care” and makes\n\n“stringent efforts” to protect its financial information in order to remain financially competitive\n\nin a highly competitive business environment. Aff. ¶¶ 6, 7. Its financial information is stored on\n\na secured database and only MNA personnel with heightened security access are permitted to\n\nobtain it, and only on a need to know basis. Aff. ¶ 7. Employees who work with this information\n\nsign strict confidentiality agreements. Id.\n\n       In short, MNA’s private financial information is a closely guarded trade secret of MNA,\n\nand qualifies as a trade secret under Texas law.\n\nIII.   This Court Should Defer Discovery of Highly Confidential and Trade Secret\n       Financial Information until there is Proof of Necessity for Such Information.\n\n       MNA has filed a motion to bifurcate the trial under § 41.009 of the Texas Civil Practices\n\n& Remedies Code. This Court should defer discovery of financial information until the second\n\nphase of a bifurcated trial for two reasons. First, highly confidential financial information is not\n\nrelevant until the second phase of a bifurcated trial. Second, MNA’s financial information is\n\ntrade secret, and, as such, Plaintiffs had the burden to demonstrate that it is necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of the case. There is no such proof. Indeed, financial information cannot be\n\nnecessary at this point in the litigation, because there is only a mere allegation of punitive\n\ndamages, and no evidence to support liability for punitive damages. Deferring discovery of net\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 4\n\n                                                                                              MR 0904\n\fworth or other financial information until the second phase of the bifurcated trial would be a\n\nproper exercise of “the [trial court’s] necessary management tools to control the sequence,\n\ntiming, and scope of discovery to minimize burden, maximize efficiency, and protect privacy\n\nrights.” In re Jacobs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761274\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761274/in-re-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, orig. proc.)\n\n(Sullivan, J., concurring).\n\n       Net worth discovery serves little practical purpose in most cases, given the statutory\n\nlimitations on exemplary damages. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 192.4 sets out a benefit-to-\n\nburden analysis and provides that discovery should be limited when “the burden or expense of\n\nthe proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit, taking into account the needs of the case, the\n\namount in controversy, the parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the\n\nlitigation, and the importance of the proposed discovery in resolving the issues.” Because the\n\nfinancial information Plaintiffs seek is highly confidential, intrudes on MNA’s substantial\n\nprivacy rights, and is trade secret, discovery of this information should be deferred to the second\n\nphase of the bifurcated trial, if it becomes relevant and necessary. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE § 41.009.\n\n       Finally, Texas Rule of Evidence 507 imposes a “heightened burden for obtaining trade\n\nsecret information.” Mere relevance is not sufficient. See Continental General Tire, 979 S.W.2d\n\n610-13 (Tex. 1998). After the party resisting discovery establishes that the information is a trade\n\nsecret, the burden shifts to the requesting party to establish that the information is “necessary for\n\na fair adjudication of tis claims.” Id. In each case, a court must conduct a balancing, weighing the\n\ndegree of the requesting party’s need for the information with the potential harm of disclosure.\n\nThe Court further clarified the burden of proof in In re Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1635307\"><a href=\"/opinion/1635307/in-re-bridgestonefirestone-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732-33 (Tex. 2003), by requiring the requesting party to “demonstrate with specificity,” by\n\n\n\n\nMOTION FOR STAY OF DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION – PAGE 5\n\n                                                                                               MR 0905\n\fcompetent evidence, the necessity of the trade secret information. As stated, there is simply no\n\nnecessity for such information at this point in the litigation – net worth evidence is inadmissible\n\nand irrelevant in the first phase of a bifurcated trial. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §§ 41.011(b).\n\nPlaintiffs have not, and cannot show necessity. Therefore, This Court should protect MNA’s\n\ntrade secret financial information, and only order its disclosure if it becomes necessary for a fair\n\nadjudication of this case. There is no prejudice to Plaintiffs if discovery of financial information\n\nis deferred until the second phase of the bifurcated trial, if it becomes relevant and necessary at\n\nthat point.\n\nIV.     Conclusion and Prayer\n\n        Wherefore, MNA prays that this Court disallow discovery of MNA’s financial\n\ninformation. Alternatively MNA seeks a stay of such financial discovery for the issue to be\n\nconsidered on mandamus at the Dallas Court of Appeals, or Texas Supreme Court, and for such\n\nother relief to which it may be entitled.\n\n\n                                              Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                              THOMPSON & KNIGHT LLP\n                                              98 San Jacinto Boulevard, Suite 1900\n                                              Austin, Texas 78701-4238\n                                              (512) 469-6114\n                                              (512) 482-5028 Facsimile\n\n                                              By:           /s/ Debora B.

(\"MNA\"), who being by me duly sworn\n\non oath deposes and says:\n\n       1.     My name is Marcel Chabot and I am the Controller at MNA. I have personal\n\n              knowledge of the facts set forth herein and if called upon, could and would,\n\n              competently testify to them.    I am over 18 years of age, of sound mind, and\n\n              competent to execute this Affidavit.\n\n       2.     I have reviewed the Order re: November 3, 2015 hearing in this case that orders\n\n              MNA to \"produce a corporate representative to testify about the financial\n\n              condition, wealth, assets, and financial statements of Defendant Michelin North\n\n              America, Inc.\"\n\n\n\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF MARC:F.L CHABOT-PAGE I\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          MR 0909\n\f       3.     MNA is not a publicly-traded company. Consequently it does not make public\n\n              disclosures concerning its net worth, financial condition, or financial statements.\n\n              Additionally, MNA is indirectly owned by a public French holding company,\n\n              Compagnie Generale Des Etablissements Michelin (\"CGEM\"). For accounting\n\n              purposes, lv!NA's financial position is fully consolidated with CGEM's financial\n\n             position, and CGEM's public filings reflect an overall picture of the Michelin\n\n              Group, and do not reflect information on MNA's specific financial position.\n\n              Consequently, MNA's financial information is not known outside of those\n\n              individuals at MNA or within the Michelin Group who have a business need to\n\n              know, and it cannot easily be obtained.\n\n       4.     MNA considers its financial information highly confidential and vitally sensitive,\n\n              and treats this information as a carefully guarded trade secret.\n\n       5.     Disclosure of MNA's financial information could seriously endanger MNA's\n\n              ability to remain financially competitive in the tire industry, which is a highly\n\n             competitive business environment. Financial information, including evidence of\n\n             net worth, can allow competitors to infer, calculate, estimate, and deduce highly\n\n             confidential information about MNA's corporate strategies, research and\n\n             development capabilities and options, and other vital aspects of its corporate\n\n             objectives, plans, financial position, governance, and management. Competitors\n\n             could then use this information to develop a competitive advantage against MNA\n\n             and impair MNA's ability to maintain its competitive position in the market.\n\n       6.    MNA takes extreme care to protect its financial information from being disclosed.\n\n             MNA has a competitive advantage by not having such information available in\n\n\n\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF MARCEL CHABOT~ PAGE 2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              MR 0910\n\f30\n\n\n\n\n     MR 0911\n\f  Via £-Service and Facsi111ile      Via £-Service and Facsi111ile\n  Luis P.
