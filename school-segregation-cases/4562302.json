Purser a/k/a Sue E. Van Zanten; Gary W. Purser, Jr.;\n                     JoAnn M. Purser; and Elizabeth H. Tipton, Appellees\n\n\n      FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF BELL COUNTY, 146TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n          NO. 236,117-B, HONORABLE ALAN MAYFIELD, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                 Attorney Jerry Scarbrough and his former clients, Melissa Victoria Deaton1\n\nand Denise Steele,2 appeal from a jury verdict in favor of Helen Purser, Sue E. Purser a/k/a\n\nSue E. Van Zanten, Gary W. Purser Jr., JoAnn M. Purser, and Elizabeth H. Tipton (the Purser\n\nFamily) on claims of fraud, defamation, and defamation per se. The Purser Family’s suit asserted\n\ndefamation and fraud claims arising from allegations that Deaton and Steele initiated an\n\ninappropriate relationship with family patriarch Gary W. Purser, Sr.3 and financially exploited him\n\n\n       1\n        Appellants’ counsel filed a suggestion of death for Deaton, stating a presumption that\nDeaton would want this appeal to continue.\n       2\n          Counsel for appellants stated at oral argument that Steele’s last name has changed to Pierce.\nFor clarity, we will refer to this appellant by her former last name, consistent with the evidence, jury\ncharge, and judgment in this case.\n       3\n           Purser Sr. was Helen’s husband, the father of Elizabeth, Gary Jr., and Sue, and the\nfather-in-law of JoAnn, who is married to Gary Jr.\n\fwhile he suffered from dementia. The suit alleged that Scarbrough, the attorney who represented\n\nDeaton and Steele, conspired with his clients and also that he defamed the Purser Family by accusing\n\nthem of abusing and murdering Purser Sr. The jury’s final judgment held Scarbrough, Steele, and\n\nDeaton jointly and severally liable for defamation and fraud based on the jury’s findings that they\n\nacted in concert or in conspiracy. The jury also found that appellants acted with malice or gross\n\nnegligence and awarded exemplary damages of $13.5 million. Additionally, the court ordered\n\nsanctions totaling $54,261.50 against Scarbrough and $5,000 against Deaton for discovery abuse.\n\n               In a voluminous and rambling appeal, Scarbrough raises 26 issues and Steele and\n\nDeaton raise 14 overlapping ones, primarily challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\nthe jury’s findings.4 They contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the Purser Family’s\n\nclaims and that the court should not have given a spoliation instruction. They also contend that there\n\nwas no evidence to support a variety of the jury’s findings and no clear-and-convincing evidence of\n\nappellants’ actual malice or gross negligence.\n\n               Scarbrough separately contends that the court erred by denying his requested question\n\nand instruction on his claim that, as an attorney, he should have qualified immunity, and that there\n\nwas no clear-and-convincing evidence he made any statement that was perceived as tending to affect\n\na person injuriously or charging a person with illegal or immoral conduct. Scarbrough also contends\n\nthat there was no basis for the discovery sanctions awards against him, that the Purser Family lacked\n\nstanding to seek sanctions, that the exemplary damage and sanctions awards against him are\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Steele and Deaton’s brief identifies fifteen issues but skips number thirteen, lists the\n“fourth issue” twice, and wholly omits their fraud-by-failure-to-disclose issue.\n\n                                                  2\n\fexcessive and unconstitutional, that the court abused its discretion by denying his requested Rule 13\n\nsanctions, and that he was entitled to “immunity from prosecution” for his report about Purser, Sr.\n\nto Adult Protective Services.\n\n                For the reasons that follow, we will reverse the portions of the judgment awarding\n\ncompensatory damages to the Purser Family on their defamation and fraud claims against\n\nScarbrough, Steele, and Deaton, with the exception of the unchallenged awards of past mental\n\nanguish damages for defamation; reverse the exemplary damages awards against Steele and Deaton;\n\nmodify the exemplary damages award against Scarbrough by applying the statutory cap; and affirm\n\nthe district court’s orders imposing sanctions against Scarbrough and Deaton.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND5\n\nPurser Sr. meets Steele, Deaton, and Olvera\n\n                Gary Purser Sr., a successful land developer and owner of several construction\n\ncompanies in Killeen, was in his late 70s and alleged to be in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease\n\nwhen he met then 29-year old Denise Steele at the Red Lobster where she worked. Steele introduced\n\nPurser Sr. to her live-in boyfriend, Clayton Olvera, and to her friend, Melissa Deaton. Purser Sr.\n\neventually hired Olvera to manage a business called Freytag Irrigation. According to Olvera,\n\nPurser Sr. and Steele began a romantic relationship and met weekly at a hotel, then later at Deaton’s\n\nhome. Olvera testified that over time, Purser Sr. gave Steele jewelry, weekly payments of $500,\n\n$5,000 every other week for a car, money for attending real-estate classes and starting a sports bar,\n\n\n\n\n       5\n           The background is summarized from evidence in the record of this appeal.\n\n                                                  3\n\fand money to pay for cosmetic surgery. Steele admitted that Purser Sr. gave her money, but she\n\ndenied that he paid for any medical procedures. She testified that Purser Sr. told her he had made\n\nseveral men into millionaires and he wanted “to make [her] the first woman millionaire.” Steele and\n\nDeaton were recorded discussing a property-development scheme with Purser Sr. in which the\n\nwomen would split $2.5 million each (the “secret recording”). In that recording they also discussed\n\nhaving Purser Sr.’s children and a fantasy of traveling to Las Vegas together. During that same\n\ndiscussion they told Purser Sr. that when he died, he should not do as some people who leave all\n\ntheir money to a dog because he had Steele and Deaton. Steele and Olvera later broke up, and\n\nOlvera was eventually fired from Freytag. During this time, Purser Sr.’s family alleges that his\n\ndeteriorating health caused memory loss, disinhibition, hypersexuality, and behavior that was out\n\nof character for him.\n\n\nOlvera sues Purser Sr. and Purser Family files third-party claims\n\n               In a demand letter to the Purser Family after his firing from Freytag, Olvera\n\nthreatened to file a lawsuit—and in it revealed that Purser Sr., who was highly regarded in the\n\ncommunity, had carried on a secret affair with Steele and lavished money and gifts on her—unless\n\nthe family paid Olvera hundreds of thousands of dollars. Deciding to investigate the truth of\n\nOlvera’s allegations, the Purser Family monitored Purser Sr.’s location through his phone and\n\ndiscovered his numerous meetings with Steele at Deaton’s house. Before one such meeting,\n\nPurser Sr. told his family that he was going to Killeen, but his phone showed that he was on IH-35\n\ndriving to Temple. Tracking his travel, Purser Sr.’s daughter-in-law JoAnn arrived at Deaton’s\n\nhouse and called her husband Purser Jr. and her sister-in-law Elizabeth, who both joined her there.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fThey heard Purser Sr.’s voice outside the house, and they confronted Steele and Deaton in the\n\nbackyard. JoAnn videotaped the confrontation. When Steele told JoAnn that she and Purser Sr.\n\nwere “just friends,” JoAnn became upset and cursed at her, believing that the “two women were\n\ntaking advantage of an old man.” Deaton called 911, reporting that people were attacking her.\n\nJoAnn also called 911 to clarify that Deaton was not being attacked, that Steele and Deaton “were\n\ntaking advantage of an older man with a problem” and that his family was trying to get him away\n\nfrom them.\n\n               About two months later, after the family told Purser Sr. that they had put a GPS\n\ndevice on his vehicle, Helen Purser called JoAnn to report that money was missing from their safe,\n\nthat Purser Sr. had driven away, and that she wanted to know where Deaton lived. JoAnn testified\n\nthat she did not want her 75-year-old mother-in-law driving to Temple, so she told Helen that she\n\nwould follow up on the matter. GPS showed JoAnn that Purser Sr. drove to his business office.\n\nWhen JoAnn arrived, staff told her that Purser Sr. had borrowed keys to a truck he did not usually\n\ndrive. Thinking that he had switched vehicles to avoid the GPS, JoAnn drove to Temple and parked\n\nacross the street from Deaton’s house, waiting to confirm whether that was Purser Sr.’s destination.\n\n               Purser Sr. arrived in the truck and parked in Deaton’s driveway. JoAnn walked up\n\nto the driver’s side window of the truck where she saw Purser Sr. counting out $100 bills into three\n\npiles on his lap, $9,300 in all, which she presumed he planned to give to Steele or Deaton. After\n\nPurser Sr. refused to exit the truck, JoAnn knocked at Deaton’s door, identified herself, and stated\n\nthat Purser Sr. was there with money and she wanted to know what was going on. Deaton did not\n\nanswer and JoAnn walked back to the truck, where she did not see the money. Purser Sr. told her\n\nthat he had hidden it and she would not find it. JoAnn entered the passenger side of the truck, found\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fthe money in an envelope in the glove compartment, and struggled with Purser Sr., telling him that\n\nthey needed to go home and sort things out. Eventually, JoAnn took the envelope and got into her\n\ncar with Purser Sr. at her window demanding the money. JoAnn had begun to “creep away” in the\n\ncar when the police arrived. Deaton had called 911 reporting that JoAnn was dragging Purser Sr.\n\ndown the street with her car and probably had weapons. JoAnn testified that no charges were filed\n\nbecause the first-responding officer’s dash-cam video, reviewed by all three responding officers at\n\nthe scene, showed that JoAnn had not dragged Purser Sr.6\n\n               Before confirming Purser Sr.’s meetings with Steele and Deaton, the Purser Family\n\nhad noticed Purser Sr. doing some unusual things: attempting to sell the same property to two\n\ndifferent buyers, losing his way home from a funeral (while driving through the town in which he\n\nhad developed several subdivisions), and giving faulty instructions to employees. His family took\n\nhim to a doctor who diagnosed Purser Sr. with early signs of Alzheimer’s, a form of dementia.\n\n               Olvera eventually followed through on his litigation threat, filing a breach-of-contract\n\nand tortious-interference suit against Purser Sr., Freytag Irrigation, and the Purser Family Trust. The\n\nPurser Family subsequently filed third-party claims against Steele and Deaton. Lawyer Scarbrough\n\nrepresented Steele and Deaton in the suit, but he withdrew from that representation after he was also\n\nnamed a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Deaton made other 911 calls accusing JoAnn of threatening to kill her and assaulting her.\nPolice investigations determined that Deaton’s allegations were false and phone records tended to\ndisprove the alleged death threat.\n\n                                                  6\n\fDefamation allegations and discovery sanctions\n\n               During the litigation, Purser Sr. developed pneumonia and died at a hospital. The\n\nnext day, Scarbrough sent a letter to Jack Crews, one of the lawyers for the Purser Family, requesting\n\nthat an autopsy be performed to confirm whether Purser Sr. had dementia.7 Scarbrough also\n\ncontacted Dan Carter, the director of the funeral home where Purser Sr.’s arrangements were\n\nunderway; Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen; the Temple Police Department; and the\n\nTexas Rangers, all to discuss Purser Sr.’s death. In each of these conversations, Scarbrough accused\n\nthe Purser Family of murdering Purser Sr. Scarbrough also reported to Adult Protective Services that\n\nthe Purser Family abused Purser Sr., and later in open court Scarbrough accused Purser Jr. and\n\nJoAnn Purser of being drug addicts. While JoAnn was running for election as a trustee on the\n\nKilleen Independent School District board, Scarbrough posted to YouTube a video of the backyard\n\nincident at Deaton’s house and audio of the 911 call that JoAnn placed during that incident.\n\n               Unknown to the Purser Family, before Purser Sr. died, Steele and Deaton told him\n\nin a recorded conversation that his family was after his money, that he could not trust his family, and\n\nthat the family wanted him institutionalized. The women urged him to put his money in a safe in\n\nDeaton’s house and come live with them. Purser Sr. allegedly began to believe what the women told\n\nhim and became suspicious of his family.\n\n               During discovery, Scarbrough had given a digital recorder that contained the\n\nabove-mentioned conversation to Shawn Richeson, his “IT guy,” to enhance clarity by removing\n\n\n       7\n          Scarbrough acknowledged that when he was serving as counsel for Deaton, he filed a\nmotion for appointment of a guardian ad litem contending that Purser Sr. was a mentally\nincapacitated person who lacked a guardian (even though Purser Sr. was represented by counsel at\nthe time). Also, in an accidental recording Scarbrough made while carrying a recorder Deaton gave\nhim, Scarbrough told his wife that Purser Sr. had dementia.\n\n                                                  7\n\fstatic and background noise. Richeson connected the recorder’s USB drive to his computer,\n\ndownloaded the contents of the recorder, and returned the recorder to Scarbrough. When Richeson\n\nlistened to the recording, he was concerned about what he heard and thought he recognized\n\nPurser Sr.’s voice. He told a Purser Family friend, John Fisher, that the recording sounded like a\n\ncouple of women trying to take advantage of an old man, and Richeson gave Fisher access to the\n\naudio file through the Internet, allowing Fisher and the Purser Family to listen to it. Fisher heard the\n\nrecording of the women telling Purser Sr. that his children were turning against him and intended\n\nto institutionalize him and testified that they sounded to him like “gold diggers.”\n\n                Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton repeatedly denied the existence of this recording in\n\ntheir discovery responses, depositions, and in sanctions hearings. Scarbrough initially told the Purser\n\nFamily’s counsel that all the tapes and audio recordings he had were already produced in discovery.\n\nBut during Deaton’s third deposition,8 Scarbrough stated that at one time Deaton had given him\n\npossession of a digital recorder, which he gave to his “IT guy” and returned to Deaton after\n\nproducing one recording from that device in discovery—and that he was now aware of another\n\nrecording on the device that he had not heard and had not yet produced. Deaton later told the court\n\nthat she had disposed of Steele’s digital recorder by giving it to Goodwill or throwing it in the trash.\n\n                At the subsequent sanctions hearings arising from this situation, Richeson testified\n\nthat without the digital recorder he could not confirm what recordings had been on it and that he no\n\n\n\n       8\n           Deaton’s deposition was taken three times, on December 14, 2010, January 7, 2011, and\nJune 29, 2011. Her first deposition ran for several hours but was suspended by agreement of counsel\nfor the re-taking of Clayton Olvera’s deposition. After Deaton’s second deposition, Elizabeth Tipton\nwas added to the lawsuit, resulting in the third setting. Her third deposition was ultimately\nsuspended because of Scarbrough’s announcement that Deaton had additional recorded witness\nstatements of Purser Sr. that had not been produced in discovery.\n\n                                                   8\n\flonger had on his server all that he had recovered from the recorder. At the end of the hearing, the\n\ndistrict court imposed $25,000 in sanctions against Scarbrough, $5,000 against Deaton for her\n\ndisposal of the digital recorder, and ruled a spoliation instruction could be included in the court’s\n\ncharge if the evidence at trial supported it (the court later determined that it did and gave the\n\ninstruction at trial). Scarbrough was also ordered to pay sanctions of $11,000 and $15,959.50 for\n\nviolating the court’s confidentiality order twice by disclosing information from Purser Sr.’s medical\n\nrecords to the Temple Police Department and to Purser Sr.’s niece, Carolyn Bolling (to whom\n\nScarbrough had misrepresented himself as Purser Sr.’s lawyer).\n\n               The case proceeded to a jury trial, resulting in a unanimous verdict for the Purser\n\nFamily, with a total of $19,440, 000.00 awarded. The lengthy jury trial gave rise to an even lengthier\n\nappeal, the numerous issues of which we address in turn.9\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n                                       I. Defamation issues\n\nA. Defamation of appellees individually\n\n               None of the appellants challenge the jury’s finding that they each made statements\n\nthat were defamatory and false. Rather, appellants contend that there is no evidence that such\n\ndefamatory statement identified any member of the Purser Family individually—i.e., appellants did\n\nnot specifically name each individual family member that they defamed—and that a defamatory\n\nstatement must be directed at the plaintiff as an ascertainable person to be actionable. However,\n\n\n\n       9\n          A bankruptcy court subsequently ruled that the judgment and sanctions orders against\nScarbrough are nondischargeable debts. In re Scarbrough, 516 B.R. 897, 924 (Bankr. W.D. Tex.\n2014), aff’d, Scarbrough v. Purser, 836 F.3d 447 (5th Cir. 2016).\n\n                                                  9\n\fwhen a group is named and the plaintiff is a readily identifiable member of the group, a cause of\n\naction for defamation exists if those who know and are acquainted with the plaintiff understand that\n\nthe statement refers to the plaintiff. See Levine v. Steve Scharn Custom Homes, Inc., 448 S.W.3d 637,\n\n651-52 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, pet. denied); Sellards v. Express-News Corp.,\n\n702 S.W.2d 677, 680 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.); see also McGregor v. Vela,\n\nNo. 03-01-00299-CV, 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 1131, at *12 (Tex. App.—Austin Feb. 14, 2002, no\n\npet.) (not designated for publication) (“Publication does not require that the plaintiff be named, if\n\nthose who know the plaintiff and are acquainted with him understand that the defamatory publication\n\nreferred to him.”).\n\n                 Here, Elizabeth testified that Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen, told the\n\nPurser Family that Scarbrough had accused them of Purser Sr.’s murder. Cooke plainly understood\n\nwho Scarbrough was referring to when he accused the Purser Family of murder. Scarbrough himself\n\ntestified that he reported to the funeral home director Dan Carter, the Temple Police Department and\n\nthe Texas Rangers his accusation that the Purser Family had murdered their husband and father.\n\nScarbrough’s murder accusations against the Purser Family included Purser Sr.’s daughter-in-law,\n\nJoAnn. Scarbrough referred to the incident in which JoAnn struggled with Purser Sr. in the truck\n\noutside Deaton’s house as “evidence” supporting his accusation that JoAnn murdered her\n\nfather-in-law.\n\n                 Under these facts, there was no misunderstanding that Scarbrough’s defamatory\n\nstatements were directed at each of the Purser Family appellees. See Levine, 448 S.W.3d at 651-52.\n\nAs to Steele and Deaton, the jury heard the recording of the women telling Purser Sr. that his family\n\ncould not be trusted and wanted to institutionalize him or put him in a home because they wanted\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fhis money. The women referenced Purser Sr.’s wife, his children, and his daughter-in-law when\n\nmaking these statements. We overrule appellants’ complaint that none of the defamatory statements\n\non which the jury assessed liability identified any member of the Purser Family individually.\n\n\nB. Publication of defamatory or false statement\n\n               As we have noted, none of the appellants challenge the jury’s finding that they each\n\nmade statements that were defamatory and false. However, appellants contend that there is no\n\nevidence that their defamatory statements about the Purser Family were published. “Publication of\n\ndefamatory words means to communicate the words, either orally, in writing, or in print, to a third\n\nperson capable of understanding their defamatory import and in such a way that the third person\n\nwould understand.” Double Diamond, Inc. v. Van Tyne, 109 S.W.3d 848, 854 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2003, no pet.). The instruction on publication in the charge required communication to a\n\nperson—other than the appellees—who is capable of understanding its meaning.\n\n               As to Scarbrough’s statements, the jury heard Scarbrough himself testify that he told\n\nthe Texas Rangers, the Temple Police Department, and Dan Carter, the director of the funeral home\n\nwhere Scarbrough’s arrangements were being made, about his accusation that the Purser Family had\n\nmurdered Purser Sr. Elizabeth testified that Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen, told the\n\nPurser Family that Scarbrough had accused them of Purser Sr.’s murder. The jury heard the\n\nrecording of Scarbrough talking to Carolyn Bolling—a nonparty to the suit and niece of\n\nPurser Sr.—in which Scarbrough claimed that he represented Purser Sr. and stated that Purser Sr.’s\n\nfamily intentionally misled doctors and caused his death.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f               As to Steele and Deaton, the jury heard the recording of the women telling\n\nPurser Sr.—a person other than the appellees—that his family could not be trusted and wanted to\n\ninstitutionalize him or put him in a home because they wanted his money, causing Purser Sr. to\n\nbecome very suspicious of his family members. Appellants’ contention that there is “no evidence”\n\nthat any defamatory or false statements about the Purser Family were published is not supported by\n\nthis record as the evidence shows the statements were made to Purser Sr. We overrule appellants’\n\ncomplaint that none of their defamatory statements were published.\n\n\nC. Clear-and-convincing evidence that Scarbrough committed defamation per se\n\n               The jury found that Scarbrough, in lodging his accusations against the Purser Family,\n\ncommitted defamation per se. Scarbrough contends that there is no clear-and-convincing evidence\n\nthat he made any statement that a witness perceived as tending to affect a person injuriously or\n\ncharging a person with illegal or immoral conduct. A false accusation of the commission of a\n\ncriminal act is defamatory per se. Leyendecker & Assocs., Inc. v. Wechter, 683 S.W.2d 369, 374\n\n(Tex. 1984).\n\n               Here, the jury’s affirmative finding of defamation per se against Scarbrough is\n\nsupported by Scarbrough’s own testimony. He acknowledged his statements to Dan Carter accusing\n\nthe Purser Family of murdering Purser Sr. by overdosing him with drugs. Scarbrough also testified\n\nthat nothing in the record from any medical professional stated that the Purser Family was providing\n\nPurser Sr. too much medication, that he had no direct causation evidence of the Purser Family’s\n\ninvolvement with Purser Sr.’s demise, and that he had no opinion from an expert medical\n\nprofessional supporting his suspicion that the family had anything to do with Purser Sr.’s demise.\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fThe jury also heard Scarbrough’s recorded conversation with Carolyn Bolling, the Pursers’ niece,\n\nin which Scarbrough accused the Purser Family of Purser Sr.’s murder. Finally, the jury heard the\n\ntestimony of Dr. Sharon L. Barber, M.D., who treated Purser Sr. during his last hospitalization and\n\nstated that she saw no signs that Purser Sr. was abused or neglected, that he had been cared for\n\n“[e]xceptionally well” by family members and a caregiver who was present twenty-four hours a day,\n\nand that there was no indication that Scarbrough was correct in his accusation about the Purser\n\nFamily having murdered Purser Sr. This evidence was sufficient to produce in the minds of the jury\n\na firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the Purser Family’s allegations—that Scarbrough\n\ncommitted defamation per se by falsely accusing the Purser Family of committing the crime of\n\nmurder. Further, there is no argument that the murder accusations Scarbrough communicated to\n\nCarter and Bolling were in any way privileged.10 We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that there is\n\nno clear-and-convincing evidence of his committing defamation per se.\n\n\nD. No immunity from defamation for Scarbrough’s report to Adult Protective Services\n\n               Scarbrough contends that he was entitled to statutory immunity for his report to Adult\n\nProtective Services that Purser Sr. was a victim of elder abuse. However, the record contains a letter\n\nfrom the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services stating its finding that “the allegations\n\nof Exploitation and Physical Abuse” of Purser Sr. “were INVALID.” The Department also stated\n\nthat “[a]ll allegations have been investigated and APS has no concerns at this time.”\n\n       10\n          Scarbrough contends for the first time in his post-submission briefing that his statements\nabout Purser Sr. were protected by “litigation immunity” because, as a pro se defendant, he had an\nattorney-client relationship with himself. That contention is novel but waived. See Romero v. State,\n927 S.W.2d 632, 634 n.2 (Tex. 1996) (concluding that argument raised for first time in\npost-submission briefing was waived); City of Houston v. Precast Structures, Inc., 60 S.W.3d 331,\n340 n.4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (same).\n\n                                                 13\n\f               The Texas Human Resources Code requires a report if there is “cause to believe” that\n\nan elderly person is in the state of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Tex. Hum. Res. Code § 48.051(a).\n\nThe statute includes an affirmative defense providing protection for such reports unless they are\n\nmade in bad faith or with malice. Id. § 48.054(a) (“A person filing a report under this chapter or\n\ntestifying or otherwise participating in any judicial proceeding arising from a petition, report, or\n\ninvestigation is immune from civil or criminal liability on account of his or her petition, report,\n\ntestimony, or participation, unless the person acted in bad faith or with a malicious purpose.”);\n\nsee Miranda v. Byles, 390 S.W.3d 543, 552 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. denied)\n\n(concluding that similar protection in section 261.106 of Texas Family Code for reporting child\n\nabuse is affirmative defense); Howard v. White, No. 05-01-01036-CV, 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 4891,\n\nat *18-20 (Tex. App.—Dallas July 10, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (concluding\n\nthat appellant was not entitled to statutory protection from defamation claims based on her report of\n\nchild abuse because she failed to prove that her report was made in good faith).\n\n               In raising statutory immunity as an affirmative defense, Scarbrough had the burden\n\nof showing that he was not acting “in bad faith or with a malicious purpose”—i.e., in good\n\nfaith—when he made his report of elder abuse. See Tex. Hum. Res. Code § 48.054(a); Byles,\n\n390 S.W.3d at 552; Howard, 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 4891, at *18-20. Scarbrough failed to meet that\n\nburden. He contends that “there was no evidence that [he] knew that Mr. Purser was not in trouble.”\n\n(Emphasis added.). But that contention impermissibly shifts the burden of proof for his affirmative\n\ndefense and is no evidence of his good faith. Further, Scarbrough admitted in his September 26, 2011\n\ndeposition that he had not seen Purser Sr. for about five months before making the report and that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fhis report was based on a remark from David Pace, his process server, who allegedly told him that\n\nPurser Sr. “was in real poor condition.” Scarbrough testified:\n\n\n       after David told me that, I was really shocked. And I was saddened. And I called the\n       Adult Protective Service, which is a State agency that has the job of\n       overseeing—protecting elderly people and adults. I called them . . . And I reported\n       it to them. . . . I reported that Mr. Purser was doing very poorly, according to my\n       process server, and that he seemed inappropriate—untimely for me—to me that he\n       would be acting or feeling that bad. And then I asked them to look into it or told\n       them about it.\n\n\nInformation in Pace’s alleged remark provided Scarbrough no “cause to believe” that the Purser\n\nFamily was abusing and exploiting Purser Sr., as Scarbrough reported to the Texas Department of\n\nFamily and Protective Services, and Scarbrough testified about no other basis for his report. See\n\nTex. Hum. Res. Code § 48.051(a). With no showing of good faith, we overrule Scarbrough’s\n\ncomplaint that he was entitled to statutory immunity for his report of elder abuse.\n\n\nE. Scarbrough was not entitled to his requested qualified-immunity instruction\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the district court erred by denying his requested question\n\nand instruction on qualified immunity for actions taken in his capacity as a lawyer for Steele and\n\nDeaton during his investigation and defense of the case including, in his view, the defamatory\n\nstatements he made against the Purser Family. We review a trial court’s decision to submit or refuse\n\na particular instruction for an abuse of discretion. Shupe v. Lingafelter, 192 S.W.3d 577, 579 (Tex.\n\n2006). Omission of an instruction is reversible error only if the omission probably caused the\n\nrendition of an improper judgment. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                15\n\f               Scarbrough’s requested instruction stated, “Attorneys have qualified immunity from\n\na suit arising from their discretionary duties in and out of the courtroom in good faith within the\n\nscope of their legal representation of respected [sic] clients.” This proposed instruction required a\n\n“good faith” element that was negated by the jury’s finding that Scarbrough acted maliciously or\n\nwith conscious indifference toward the Purser Family.11 Thus, the court’s declining to submit the\n\ninstruction as worded was harmless. See id. at 580 (holding that omission of instruction was\n\nharmless because jury’s answer to submitted question negated unsubmitted issue); Laughman v. Sun\n\nPipe Line Co., 114 S.W. 451, 453 (Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1908, no writ) (concluding that any\n\nerror in omitting issue from charge would be harmless where jury’s verdict against appellants on\n\nissues that were submitted necessarily includes finding against appellants on omitted issue); see also\n\nJames v. Easton, 368 S.W.3d 799, 803 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied) (“An\n\nattorney generally has immunity from claims by an opposing party based upon conduct the attorney\n\nundertook in the representation of a client, but this immunity does not apply to alleged torts based\n\nupon the attorney’s fraudulent or malicious conduct.”); McGregor, 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 1131,\n\nat *15-16 (“Because the jury found that the communication was made with actual malice,\n\nMcGregor’s claim of qualified privilege would have failed even if the jury had found that the\n\nprivilege applied.”). We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that the court refused his requested\n\nqualified-immunity instruction.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n            That finding was supported by legally sufficient evidence, as we note later in\nour discussion.\n\n                                                 16\n\fF. Defamation damages\n\n               The jury was instructed, without objection, that they could award damages if they\n\nfound defamation committed by any appellant or defamation per se committed by Scarbrough. The\n\njury found that all three appellants committed defamation and that Scarbrough also committed\n\ndefamation per se. Based on these findings, the jury awarded the Purser Family damages for injury\n\nto reputation in the past and future and for mental anguish in the past and future. Appellants do not\n\nchallenge the jury’s awards to the Purser Family for past mental anguish. In fact, their briefing\n\nconcedes that “[t]he record is replete with evidence of past damages.”\n\n               For injury to reputation, the jury awarded the Purser Family the following damages:\n\n\n\n HELEN                            Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n past reputation                 $25,000                 $25,000                   $150,000\n future reputation               $25,000                 $25,000                   $150,000\n\n\n SUE                              Steele                   Deaton                Scarbrough\n past reputation                 $25,000                  $25,000                   $50,000\n future reputation               $30,000                  $25,000                   $50,000\n\n\n PURSER JR.                       Steele                   Deaton                Scarbrough\n past reputation                 $25,000                  $25,000                  $150,000\n future reputation               $25,000                  $25,000                  $150,000\n\n\n JOANN                            Steele                   Deaton                Scarbrough\n past reputation                 $25,000                  $50,000                  $150,000\n future reputation               $25,000                  $25,000                  $150,000\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f ELIZABETH                         Steele                   Deaton                  Scarbrough\n past reputation                      0                         0                     $150,000\n future reputation                    0                         0                     $150,000\n\n\n\nAppellants contend that there is no evidence that the Purser Family sustained any injury to their\n\nreputations in the past and no evidence that they will likely sustain injury to their reputations in the\n\nfuture. We agree that there was no evidence that the defamatory statements by Steele and Deaton,\n\nconsisting of their statements to Purser Sr., caused injury to the Purser Family’s reputations in the\n\npast or future, and we sustain their issue.\n\n                As to Scarbrough’s statements that were defamatory per se—accusing the family of\n\nelder abuse and murder—evidence of injury to reputation was unnecessary. Texas law presumes that\n\ndefamatory per se statements cause reputational harm and entitle a plaintiff to general damages,\n\nincluding loss of reputation and mental anguish. Burbage v. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d 249, 259 (Tex.\n\n2014). However, that presumption yields only nominal damages. Id. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\ninstructed that beyond nominal damages, presumed damages are reviewed for evidentiary support.12\n\nId. Nominal damages, such as $1, are a trivial sum of money awarded to a litigant who has\n\nestablished a cause of action but has not established that he is entitled to compensatory damages.\n\nHancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d 59, 65 (Tex. 2013). In defamation per se cases, nominal damages\n\nare awarded when there is no proof of serious harm resulting from the defendant’s attack on the\n\nplaintiff’s character and reputation or when they are the only damages claimed, and the action is\n\n\n\n       12\n           Appellants do not challenge the amounts the jury awarded as damages for defamation, i.e.,\nfor injury to reputation and mental anguish.\n\n                                                  18\n\fbrought to vindicate the plaintiff’s character through a jury verdict establishing the falsity of the\n\ndefamatory matter. Id.\n\n               Here, because the jury awarded more than nominal damages as to defamation per se,\n\nthere must be legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s findings of damage to the Purser\n\nFamily members’ reputations in the past and future. See Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259. When\n\nconducting a legal-sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\nchallenged finding and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it, disregarding\n\ncontrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822,\n\n827 (Tex. 2005). To prevail, an appellant must show that no more than a scintilla of evidence\n\nsupports a finding on which the opponent had the burden of proof. See Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc.\n\nv. Texas Disposal Sys. Landfill, Inc., 434 S.W.3d 142, 156-57 (Tex. 2014); City of Keller,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 826. More than a scintilla of evidence exists to support a finding when the evidence\n\nenables reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Gharda USA, Inc.\n\nv. Control Sols., Inc., 464 S.W.3d 338, 347 (Tex. 2015). We may not substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the jury when the evidence falls within the zone of reasonable disagreement, and the jury is\n\nthe sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony. See\n\nCity of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 816-17, 819-20, 822.\n\n\n               1. No evidence supporting injury to reputation\n\n               The Texas Supreme Court has cautioned that in defamation cases our review of a\n\njury’s discretionary damage awards remains important to protect free speech, and we must ensure\n\nthat noneconomic damages are not simply disguised disapproval of defendants, but compensation\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\ffor actual injuries. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259. In Burbage, the Court noted that while some\n\nevidence suggested community awareness and discussion of the defamatory statements, there was\n\nonly vague testimony about the actual impact of the defamation, the basis for which the damage\n\naward compensated. Id. at 262.\n\n                Similarly here, despite the appalling nature of Scarbrough’s assertions, we conclude\n\nthat there was no evidence supporting the jury’s findings of injury to the Purser Family’s reputations\n\nin the past and future. The evidence at trial did not demonstrate the actual impact of the defamation\n\non the Purser Family that would meet the Burbage standard. See id. We sustain Scarbrough’s\n\ncomplaint that there is no evidence his defamatory statements caused the Purser Family to sustain\n\ninjury to their reputations in the past and no evidence that they will likely sustain injury to their\n\nreputations in the future.\n\n                2. No evidence supporting damage amounts for future mental anguish\n\n                The jury also awarded the Purser Family damages for mental anguish in the past and\n\nfuture on their defamation claims. As noted above, the jury’s awards for mental anguish in the past,\n\nwhich total $1,060,000, will stand and none of the appellants challenge them.13 However, appellants\n\ndo contend that there is no evidence to support the jury’s award based on the Purser Family suffering\n\n\n\n\n        13\n          Appellants complain that the Purser Family did not segregate “mental disturbances” they\nsustained as a result of Purser Sr.’s death from “mental disturbances” caused by the appellants’ acts.\nHowever, it was appellants’ burden to object if they perceived that a broad-form damages question\nmixed valid and invalid elements of damages. See Burbage v. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d 249, 255-56\n(Tex. 2014). Appellants’ failure to make that objection below waives this complaint. Even if it were\npreserved, appellants acknowledge that no Texas court has required such a segregation of\nmental-anguish damages.\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fmental anguish in the future. The jury awarded the following damages to the Purser Family for\n\nfuture mental anguish:\n\n\n\n HELEN                            Steele                 Deaton                  Scarbrough\n future mental anguish           $25,000                 $25,000                  $150,000\n\n\n SUE                               Steele                 Deaton                Scarbrough\n future mental anguish            $25,000                 $25,000                  $50,000\n\n\n PURSER JR.                        Steele                 Deaton                Scarbrough\n future mental anguish            $25,000                 $25,000                 $150,000\n\n\n JOANN                             Steele                 Deaton                Scarbrough\n future mental anguish            $25,000                 $25,000                 $150,000\n\n\n ELIZABETH                         Steele                 Deaton                Scarbrough\n future mental anguish            $25,000                 $25,000                 $150,000\n\n\n\nBecause the jury awarded more than nominal damages, there must be legally sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s findings of the Purser Family members’ future mental anguish. See id. at 259. To\n\nsupport an award for future mental anguish, a plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable probability of\n\nsuffering compensable mental anguish in the future. Adams v. YMCA of San Antonio, 265 S.W.3d 915,\n\n917 (Tex. 2008). Mental anguish is compensable only if it causes a substantial disruption in daily\n\nroutine or a high degree of mental pain and distress. Hancock, 400 S.W.3d at 68. Evidence of the\n\nnature, duration, and severity of the mental anguish is required. Id. A plaintiff’s evidence of\n\ncontinuing depression, humiliation, sleeplessness, headaches, and detrimental effects on daily\n\n                                                21\n\factivities and relationships can be legally sufficient to support an award of damages for future mental\n\nanguish. Fifth Club, Inc. v. Ramirez, 196 S.W.3d 788, 791 (Tex. 2006). Mental anguish awards are\n\nnoneconomic damages that must be compensation for actual injuries and not simply a disguised\n\ndisapproval of the defendant. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259.\n\n               We conclude that the evidence at trial did not show demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability that appellants’ defamatory statements would cause the Purser Family to suffer\n\ncompensable future mental anguish—i.e, a substantial disruption in daily routine or a high degree\n\nof mental pain and distress. See Adams, 265 S.W.3d at 917. We sustain appellants’ complaint that\n\nthere is no evidence to support the jury’s award of damages for the Purser Family’s suffering of\n\nmental anguish in the future.\n\n\n                                          II. Fraud issues\n\n               The jury found that each of the appellants committed fraud against Helen, Purser Sr.’s\n\nwidow, in two ways: (1) fraud by misrepresentation and (2) fraud by failure to disclose.\n\n\nA. Steele and Deaton waived fraud-by-failure-to-disclose issue\n\n               Steele and Deaton waived their issue regarding the jury’s finding of “fraud by failure\n\nto disclose” by wholly omitting any briefing of it. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). The jury was\n\ninstructed without objection that they could award damages based on a “Yes” answer for either the\n\n“fraud by misrepresentation” or “fraud by failure to disclose” theory. But Steele and Deaton failed\n\nto address the fraud-by-failure-to-disclose theory, which was an independent basis supporting the\n\njury’s answer to the fraud question. Thus, the liability finding against Steele and Deaton for fraud\n\nis unchallenged and must stand.\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fB. No evidence of Scarbrough’s fraud by misrepresentation or failure to disclose\n\n               Scarbrough contends that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s finding that he\n\ncommitted fraud by misrepresentation against Helen because there is no evidence he ever said\n\nanything to her. The charge instructed the jury that “fraud by misrepresentation” occurs when:\n\n\n       (A)     a party makes a material misrepresentation,\n\n       (B)     the misrepresentation is made with knowledge of its falsity or made\n               recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion, and\n\n       (C)     the misrepresentation is made with the intention that it should be acted on by\n               the other party, and\n\n       (D)     the other party acts in reliance on the representation and thereby\n               suffers injury.\n\n\n               We agree that there was no evidence at trial of Scarbrough saying anything directly\n\nto Helen, or that he made any misrepresentation to her. To the extent that the misrepresentation at\n\nissue here was the existence of the tape-recorded statements during litigation, that issue is covered\n\nin the sanctions analysis below. We sustain Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s finding that he committed fraud by misrepresentation against Helen.\n\n               Scarbrough further contends that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s finding\n\nthat he committed fraud by failure to disclose against Helen. The charge instructed the jury that\n\n“fraud by failure to disclose” occurs when:\n\n\n       (A)     a party fails to disclose a material fact within the knowledge of that party,\n\n       (B)     the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the fact and does not have\n               an equal opportunity to discover the truth,\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        (C)     the party intends to induce the other party to take some action by failing to\n                disclose the fact, and\n\n        (D)     the other party suffers injury as a result of acting without knowledge of the\n                undisclosed fact.\n\n\nScarbrough contends there is no evidence that as opposing counsel for Steele and Deaton (or later\n\nas a defendant) he had a duty to disclose anything to Helen. Scarbrough notes that there is no private\n\nright of action for violation of the Texas attorney disciplinary rules, thus, any failure to produce\n\nwitness-statement recordings in discovery was not a “failure to disclose” that would support Helen’s\n\nfraud claim against him. See Jones v. Blume, 196 S.W.3d 440, 450 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet.\n\ndenied). He also notes that there is no cause of action for “fraud on the community” based on any\n\nfraudulent transfer of marital assets in this context, which does not involve a divorce or probate suit.\n\nCf. Chu v. Hong, 249 S.W.3d 441, 445 (Tex. 2008); Schlueter v. Schlueter, 975 S.W.2d 584, 589\n\n(Tex. 1998). We agree that there was no evidence at trial that Scarbrough had a duty to disclose\n\nanything to Helen independent of her complaints about his discovery abuse, which were addressed\n\nby sanctions. We sustain Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s\n\nfinding that he committed fraud by failure to disclose against Helen.\n\n\nC. Fraud damages\n\n               Based on its finding of fraud, the jury awarded Helen damages for loss of community\n\nproperty and mental anguish (problematically, the jury was not asked to answer with amounts as to\n\neach appellant):\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f               loss of community property        past mental anguish       future mental anguish\n HELEN                  $1.5 million                    $500,000                   $250,000\n\n\n\nAppellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s findings of loss of\n\ncommunity property and mental anguish, contending that there is no evidence that Helen sustained\n\nthese damages due to any fraud by appellants.\n\n               Based on our conclusion that there is insufficient evidence supporting the fraud claim\n\nagainst Scarbrough, the fraud damages for loss of community property and mental anguish against\n\nhim cannot stand.\n\n               As to Steele and Deaton, although they failed to brief the issue of liability, there is\n\nno evidence of any damages resulting from alleged fraud had they committed it, thus there are no\n\nfraud damages for loss of community property and mental anguish. While Steele and Deaton appear\n\nto have taken advantage of Purser Sr., the evidence is not sufficient to prove the elements of fraud.\n\nWe sustain Steele’s and Deaton’s complaint that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s damage\n\nfindings of loss of community property and mental anguish based on fraud.14\n\n\n                        III. Conspiracy issues on defamation and fraud\n\nNo evidence of conspiracy\n\n               The jury found that appellants were part of a conspiracy that damaged Helen Purser.\n\nAppellants contend that there was no evidence of conspiracy because there was “no evidence of any\n\n\n\n\n       14\n          Based on our resolution of the fraud issue, we need not address appellants’ contention that\nthere was no evidence that they acted in concert with one another in committing fraud.\n\n                                                 25\n\funderlying tort.” However, as we have noted, none of the appellants challenged the jury’s finding\n\nthat they each made statements that were defamatory and false (they argued only that their statements\n\ndid not name specific individuals, were not published, and were not defamatory per se). Thus, the\n\nunderlying torts of defamation and defamation per se—for which the jury made an unchallenged\n\naward of past mental anguish damages—survive this appeal.\n\n               The conspiracy question in the charge (conditioned on a finding of defamation,\n\ndefamation per se, or fraud) instructed the jury that:\n\n\n       To be part of a conspiracy, more than one person must have had knowledge of,\n       agreed to, and intended a common objective or course of action that resulted in the\n       damages to Helen Purser. One or more persons involved in the conspiracy must have\n       performed some act or acts to further the conspiracy.\n       Each co-conspirator is responsible for all acts done by any of the conspirators in\n       furtherance of the unlawful combination.\n\n\nAlthough appellants do not challenge the jury’s finding that they made false and defamatory\n\nstatements, the evidence showed that Steele and Deaton made their defamatory statements in a\n\nrecording with Purser Sr. around May 2010, before they met Scarbrough, and that Scarbrough made\n\nhis defamatory statements after Purser Sr.’s death in July 2011. Neither the evidence nor the timing\n\nof their statements supports a finding that when the statements were made, appellants had a common\n\nobjective to commit defamation.       We sustain appellants’ issue that there was no evidence\n\nof conspiracy.15\n\n\n\n\n       15\n         Based on our resolution of this issue, we need not address appellants’ contention that there\nwas no evidence that they acted in concert with one another in committing defamation.\n\n                                                 26\n\f                                 IV. Exemplary damages issues\n\nA. Malice or gross negligence\n\n               The jury found that the harm to the Purser Family resulted from malice or gross\n\nnegligence. Appellants contend that there is no clear-and-convincing proof supporting the jury’s\n\nfinding. The jury was instructed to answer the question on malice or gross negligence only if they\n\nunanimously answered “Yes” to the questions on defamation, defamation per se, or fraud. The\n\ncharge defined “clear and convincing evidence,” “malice,” and “gross negligence”:\n\n\n       “Clear and convincing evidence” means the measure or degree of proof that produces\n       a firm belief or conviction of the truth of the allegations sought to be established.\n\n       “Malice” means a specific intent by Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or\n       Jerry Scarbrough, to cause substantial injury or harm to Helen Purser,\n       Sue Van Zanten, Gary “Bubba” Purser, Jr., JoAnn Purser, or Elizabeth Tipton.\n\n       “Gross negligence” means an act or omission by Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or\n       Jerry Scarbrough,\n\n       (a)     which when viewed objectively from the standpoint of Melissa Deaton,\n               Denise Steele or Jerry Scarbrough at the time of its occurrence involves an\n               extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the\n               potential harm to others; and\n\n       (b)     of which Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or Jerry Scarbrough has actual\n               subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceeds with\n               conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.\n\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 41.001 (defining “clear and convincing,” “malice,” and “gross\n\nnegligence”), 41.003 (setting forth standards for recovery of exemplary damages). Because we have\n\nalready sustained appellants’ no-evidence issues as to the jury’s damage awards for injury to\n\nreputation (past and future) and for future mental anguish, what remains are the unchallenged awards\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fon the defamation claims for past mental anguish. Exemplary damages based on these awards could\n\nhave been supported if the Purser Family showed by clear-and-convincing evidence that the harm\n\nfrom appellants’ defamatory statements was the result of gross negligence or malice. See Pitts\n\n& Collard, L.L.P. v. Schechter, 369 S.W.3d 301, 331 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no\n\npet.); see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.003(a). A defendant’s repetition of false and\n\ndefamatory accusations about plaintiff’s “dishonest, unethical, and illegal behavior” can show\n\n“specific intent to injure” and support a jury’s finding of malice. Pitts, 369 S.W.3d at 331.\n\n\n               1. Steele and Deaton waived issue of gross negligence\n\n               Here, the jury made the unchallenged finding that Steele and Deaton made statements\n\nabout the Purser Family that were false and defamatory. The statements included telling Purser Sr.\n\nthat he could not trust his family, that his family was after his money, and that his family wanted him\n\ninstitutionalized. Steele and Deaton waived any issue as to whether there was clear-and-convincing\n\nevidence that they made these defamatory statements with gross negligence by failing to brief this\n\nissue. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). The jury was asked whether the harm to the Purser Family\n\nresulted from malice or gross negligence. But on appeal, Steele and Deaton failed to brief any issue\n\nas to gross negligence, which was an independent basis for the awards of exemplary damages against\n\nthem. Thus the jury’s finding of gross negligence against Steele and Deaton is unchallenged and\n\nmust stand.\n\n\n               2. Clear-and-convincing evidence of Scarbrough’s malice\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the evidence supports the jury’s finding of malice because he\n\nshowed a “specific intent to injure” through his repeated false and defamatory statements accusing\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fthe Purser Family of elder abuse and murder. Cf. Pitts, 369 S.W.3d at 331. The jury heard\n\ndeposition testimony from Scarbrough about his murder accusations and a recording of a phone call\n\nto Carolyn Bolling that Scarbrough made two months after his deposition. In the recording—after\n\nstating that he represented Purser Sr.—Scarbrough told her that the Purser Family abused Purser Sr.,\n\nintentionally misled his doctors, and caused his death.\n\n               Scarbrough’s testimony showed that he persisted in making accusations that Purser\n\nSr. did not have dementia and was murdered by his family despite a lack of evidence and even\n\nScarbrough’s own admission that he had no medical evidence or medical-expert opinion to support\n\nthose accusations. And long before he made his accusations to the Pursers’ niece, a funeral director,\n\nand law enforcement, Scarbrough accidentally recorded himself admitting to his wife that Purser Sr.\n\nhad dementia. In addition to that recorded admission, the jury heard Scarbrough acknowledge during\n\nhis deposition that Purser Sr. had been diagnosed by his doctors with dementia. The jury also heard\n\nthat Scarbrough propounded interrogatories to the deceased Purser Sr.—more than a month after\n\nPurser Sr.’s death and knowing Purser Sr. was deceased—asking about Purser Sr.’s sexual activities\n\nand affairs, and that Scarbrough questioned Helen in a lengthy deposition—held just two months\n\nafter her husband’s death—about irrelevant matters such as her medical history and private\n\nintimacies with Purser Sr. The jury further heard Scarbough’s statement to his wife, which he\n\ninadvertently recorded, discussing certain Purser Family members and stating his intent to get “a\n\nmillion dollars from every one of those sons of bitches” in the lawsuit.\n\n               The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding of\n\nmalice, shows that Scarbrough chose to defame the Purser Family with repeated murder accusations\n\nand attempted to obtain an autopsy to “disprove” Purser Sr. had dementia, despite Scarbrough’s own\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fopinion that Purser Sr. suffered from that condition. The evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of Scarbrough’s willfulness, and not that Scarbrough had a good-faith belief in his\n\nstatements. Further, the evidence was sufficient to produce in the minds of the jury a firm belief or\n\nconviction as to the truth of the allegations of malice—that Scarbrough, by making repeated\n\naccusations of illegal behavior against the Purser Family, had a specific intent to cause\n\nsubstantial injury or harm to them. See id. We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no\n\nclear-and-convincing proof that he made his defamatory statements with malice.\n\n\nB. Exemplary damage awards\n\n               The jury unanimously awarded these exemplary damages:\n\n\n\n\n HELEN                             Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages             $1.5 million               $500,000                 $2 million\n\n\n SUE                               Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages               $500,000                 $250,000                 $1 million\n\n\n PURSER JR.                        Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages               $500,000                 $500,000                 $2 million\n\n\n JOANN                             Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages               $500,000                 $500,000                 $2 million\n\n\n ELIZABETH                         Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages               $500,000                 $250,000                 $1 million\n\n\n\n\n                                                 30\n\f               In determining what amount of exemplary damages to award against appellants, if\n\nany, the jury was instructed to consider:\n\n\n        (1) the nature of the wrong;\n\n        (2) the character of the conduct involved;\n\n        (3) the degree of culpability of Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele, or Jerry Scarbrough;\n\n        (4) the situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned;\n\n        (5) the extent to which such conduct offends a public sense of justice and propriety; and\n\n        (6) the net worth of Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele, or Jerry Scarbrough.\n\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.011(a) (setting forth evidence factfinder should consider in\n\ndetermining amount of exemplary damages award); Service Corp. Int’l v. Guerra, 348 S.W.3d 221,\n\n238 (Tex. 2011) (noting these statutory factors); Alamo Nat’l Bank v. Kraus, 616 S.W.2d 908, 910\n\n(Tex. 1981) (providing analysis of first five factors).\n\n\n               1. Net worth\n\n               Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton contend that the jury’s award of exemplary damages\n\nis excessive and unconstitutional because “[i]f a judgment is so large, in relation to a party’s net\n\nworth, that it is impossible to pay, and it converts the proceeding into a criminal proceeding, wherein\n\nthe party is subject to being in jail for an interminable time due to inability to pay.” They cited no\n\nauthority in support of this contention.16\n\n\n\n\n       16\n            Scarbrough contends that he has a “negative” net worth. However, there was no evidence\nat trial of his negative net worth.\n\n                                                  31\n\f               While evidence of net worth is one factor that the jury considers in its determination\n\nof the proper amount of exemplary damages, introduction of such evidence is not mandatory.\n\nBarnhart v. Morales, 459 S.W.3d 733, 751-52 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.)\n\n(citing Durban v. Guajardo, 79 S.W.3d 198, 210-11 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2002, no pet.)). Parties\n\nmay discover and offer evidence of a defendant’s net worth in cases in which punitive or exemplary\n\ndamages may be awarded, Lunsford v. Morris, 746 S.W.2d 471, 472 (Tex. 1988), but a jury is not\n\nrequired to consider evidence of a defendant’s net worth before imposing exemplary damages,\n\nBarnhart, 459 S.W.3d at 752. Because evidence of a defendant’s net worth is not a prerequisite to\n\na jury’s imposition of exemplary damages, we conclude that this factor was not determinative of the\n\nawards of exemplary damages against Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton. See Barnhart, 459 S.W.3d\n\nat 752.\n\n\n               2. Excessiveness\n\n               Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton also contend generally that courts “must consider a\n\npunishment that would deter and punish without being gratuitously excessive.” Bennett v. Reynolds,\n\nNo. 03-05-00034-CV, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 9213, at *13 (Tex. App.—Austin Nov. 18, 2010, no\n\npet.) (mem. op. on remand); see also Bunton v. Bentley, 153 S.W.3d 50, 54 (Tex. 2004) (“Ideally,\n\nthe court of appeals should automatically reevaluate exemplary damages whenever compensatory\n\ndamages are reduced.”). The Texas Supreme Court has stated that exemplary damages should be\n\n“reasonably proportioned to actual damages” and provided the five factors in Alamo National Bank\n\nv. Kraus for courts to consider in determining the reasonableness of an award of exemplary damages.\n\nDillard Dep’t Stores v. Silva, 148 S.W.3d 370, 373 (Tex. 2004) (citing Kraus, 616 S.W.2d at 910).\n\nIn addition to net worth (which we have addressed above), the charge instructed the jury to consider\n\n                                                32\n\fthe five Kraus factors: (1) the nature of the wrong; (2) the character of the conduct involved; (3) the\n\ndegree of appellants’ culpability; (4) the situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned; and\n\n(5) the extent to which such conduct offends a public sense of justice and propriety.\n\n\n               A. Kraus factors as to Scarbrough\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the wrong was his false and defamatory murder accusation. The\n\njury found by clear-and-convincing evidence that the character of Scarbrough’s conduct was\n\nmalicious and as part of its finding, that Scarbrough had a high degree of culpability based on his\n\n“specific intent” to cause substantial injury or harm to the Purser Family. We have concluded that\n\nthe evidence, detailed above, was sufficient to support that finding. The evidence at trial on the next\n\nfactor, the situation and sensibilities of the parties, also supports the jury’s award of exemplary\n\ndamages. The Purser Family, having endured the loss of Purser Sr., then had to deal with the\n\nhumiliation of being falsely and repeatedly accused by Scarbrough of causing Purser Sr.’s death.\n\nScarbrough’s own briefing concedes that this record is “replete with evidence of past damages” that\n\nthe Purser Family sustained based on defamation. Finally, regarding the last factor, we conclude that\n\nScarbrough’s repeatedly making false and defamatory murder accusations against the Purser Family\n\nin this case “offends a public sense of justice and propriety.” Scarbrough claimed to have made his\n\naccusations in an attempt to obtain an autopsy on Purser Sr. “disproving” his dementia. But\n\nScarbrough believed, as he told his wife, that Purser Sr. had dementia. No medical evidence or\n\nexpert supported Scarbrough’s murder accusations, and Scarbrough admitted in his deposition that\n\nPurser Sr. had been diagnosed by his doctors with dementia. Further, Scarbrough told Purser’s niece\n\nfour months after Purser Sr. died—when an autopsy was unlikely—that the Purser Family abused\n\nPurser Sr., intentionally misled his doctors, and caused his death.\n\n                                                  33\n\f               A rational jury could have found that Scarbrough’s repeated defamation of the Purser\n\nFamily was not designed to obtain an autopsy disproving Purser Sr.’s dementia, but rather to\n\nleverage his position in the underlying lawsuit. The jury heard Scarbrough admit that he made his\n\naccusations of abuse and exploitation to Adult Protective Services while he was representing Deaton\n\nand seeking a substantial sum of money from Purser Family members. The jury also heard\n\nScarbrough’s statement to his wife, which he inadvertently recorded, about his intent to get “a\n\nmillion dollars from every one of those sons of bitches.”17\n\n\n               B. Kraus factors as to Steele and Deaton\n\n               As to Steele and Deaton, the wrong was their defamation of the Purser Family in\n\ncommunicating to Purser Sr. Steele and Deaton told Purser Sr. that his family was after his money,\n\nthat his family wanted him institutionalized, and that his family could not be trusted. Steele and\n\nDeaton have not challenged the jury’s finding by clear-and-convincing evidence that their false and\n\ndefamatory statements were made with gross negligence. Further, there was sufficient evidence at\n\ntrial concerning the nature and character of Steele’s and Deaton’s conduct—i.e., defaming the Purser\n\nFamily to Purser Sr. to secure further financial gain—and the high degree of Steele’s and Deaton’s\n\nculpability for that conduct to support the jury’s award of exemplary damages. The evidence at trial\n\non the next factor, the situations and sensibilities of the parties, also supports the jury’s award of\n\n\n\n       17\n           The record shows that Scarbrough engaged in other conduct offensive to a public sense\nof justice and propriety, including: (1) his propounding interrogatories to the deceased Purser\nSr.—more than a month after Purser Sr.’s death and knowing Purser Sr. was deceased—asking about\nPurser Sr.’s sexual activities and affairs; and (2) his questioning of Helen—in a lengthy deposition\nheld just two months after her husband’s death—about irrelevant matters such as her medical history\nand private intimacies with Purser Sr.\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fexemplary damages. The jury had sufficient evidence to find that the situation and sensibilities of\n\nthe parties involved Steele’s and Deaton’s receiving money from Purser Sr., who was alleged to be\n\nsuffering from dementia, planning of further financial gain through a real-estate development scheme\n\nthat would net them $2.5 million each, and encouraging Purser Sr. to leave his money to\n\nthem—meanwhile persuading him that his family members were the ones scheming against him.\n\nThis evidence also supports the jury’s findings that Steele’s and Deaton’s conduct of defaming the\n\nPurser Family to Purser Sr. to secure further financial gain “offended a public sense of justice\n\nand propriety.”\n\n\n               C. Statutory cap\n\n               In addition to the Kraus factors, we must consider application of the statutory cap on\n\nsuch awards in addressing Scarbrough’s, Steele’s, and Deaton’s complaints about the excessiveness\n\nof the jury’s exemplary-damages award. Decisions about whether exemplary damages should be\n\nawarded and the amount of exemplary damages awarded are reserved to the discretion of the trier\n\nof fact, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.010(b), but an exemplary damage award may not exceed\n\nthe cap set forth in section 41.008 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, id. § 41.008(b).\n\nIn the absence of certain types of criminal conduct not implicated here, section 41.008 limits an\n\naward of exemplary damages to the greater of:\n\n\n       (1) (A) two times the amount of economic damages; plus\n\n           (B) an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n               exceed $750,000; or\n\n       (2) $200,000.\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fId. § 41.008(b).\n\n               After reviewing the entire record, analyzing the evidence under the Kraus factors,\n\nconsidering the amount of compensatory damages, and applying the statutory cap, we conclude\n\nthat exemplary damages are recoverable against Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton. However,\n\nthe exemplary-damage awards against them are excessive in light of the statutory cap in\n\nsection 41.008(b).\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the jury awarded the Purser Family $8,000,000 in exemplary\n\ndamages. Applying section 41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $700,000 in noneconomic\n\ndamages for past mental anguish results in a maximum award of $700,000 in exemplary damages.\n\nSee id. (authorizing award for greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages\n\nfound by the jury, not to exceed $750,000”). Because the $8,000,000 exemplary damages award\n\nagainst Scarbrough exceeds the statutory cap by $7,300,000, we modify the exemplary damage\n\naward to $700,000 to comply with the cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n               As to Steele, the jury awarded exemplary damages of $3,500,000. Applying section\n\n41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $180,000 in noneconomic damages for past mental\n\nanguish results in a maximum award of $200,000 in exemplary damages. See id. (authorizing award\n\nfor greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n\nexceed $750,000”). Because the $3,500,000 exemplary damages award against Steele exceeds the\n\nstatutory cap by $3,300,000, we modify the exemplary damage award to $200,000 to comply with\n\nthe cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n               As to Deaton, the jury awarded exemplary damages of $2,000,000. Applying section\n\n41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $180,000 in noneconomic damages for past mental\n\n\n                                               36\n\fanguish results in a maximum award of $200,000 in exemplary damages. See id. (authorizing award\n\nfor greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n\nexceed $750,000”). Because the $2,000,000 exemplary damages award against Deaton exceeds the\n\nstatutory cap by $1,800,000, we modify the exemplary damage award to $200,000 to comply with\n\nthe cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n\n                      V. Spoliation and discovery-abuse sanctions issues\n\nA. Spoliation instruction as to Scarbrough\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the district court erred in giving a spoliation instruction\n\nagainst him regarding the digital recorder because there is no evidence that he failed to preserve the\n\ndigital recorder or had a duty to preserve it when he returned it to Deaton. When conducting a\n\nlegal-sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged\n\nfinding and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it and disregard contrary evidence\n\nunless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, 827. To prevail, an appellant\n\nmust show that no more than a scintilla of evidence supports a finding on which the opponent had\n\nthe burden of proof. See Waste Mgmt. of Tex., 434 S.W.3d at 156-57; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d\n\nat 826. More than a scintilla of evidence exists to support a finding when the evidence enables\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Gharda USA, 464 S.W.3d at 347.\n\nWe may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury when the evidence falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement, and the jury is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the\n\nweight to be given to their testimony. See City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 816-17, 819-20, 822.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\f               We review a trial court’s submission of a spoliation instruction to the jury for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Brookshire Bros., Ltd. v. Aldridge, 438 S.W.3d 9, 27 (Tex. 2014). Under that\n\nstandard, we will reverse only if the court acted “without regard for guiding rules or principles.”\n\nU-Haul Int’l, Inc. v. Waldrip, 380 S.W.3d 118, 132 (Tex. 2012). Spoliation of evidence requires two\n\naffirmative findings from the trial court: (1) that the nonproducing party had a duty to preserve the\n\nevidence, and (2) that the nonproducing party breached its duty to preserve material and relevant\n\nevidence. Aldridge, 438 S.W.3d at 20. A spoliation instruction is an appropriate remedy when a\n\nparty’s spoliation of evidence is intentional. Id. at 24. Intentional spoliation “includes the concept\n\nof ‘willful blindness,’ which encompasses the scenario in which a party does not directly destroy\n\nevidence known to be relevant and discoverable, but nonetheless allows for its destruction.” Id. at\n\n24-25 (citing Andrew Hebl, Spoliation of Electronically Stored Information, Good Faith, and\n\nRule 37(e), 29 N. Ill. U. L. Rev. 79, 97-98 (2008)).\n\n               Because Scarbrough does not contend that the spoliation instruction was legally\n\nincorrect, we analyze the sufficiency of the evidence based on the charge given. See Kia Motors\n\nCorp. v. Ruiz, 432 S.W.3d 865, 875 (Tex. 2014). The charge stated:\n\n\n       You are instructed that Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and Jerry Scarbrough\n       intentionally did not preserve or failed to produce the digital recorder when they\n       knew or should have known that a claim had been filed and that the digital recorder\n       in their possession or control would be material and relevant to that claim.\n\n       Under such circumstances, the failure of Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and\n       Jerry Scarbrough to preserve or produce evidence within her or his control raises\n       the presumption that if such evidence were produced, it would operate against\n       Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and Jerry Scarbrough.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fScarbrough does not dispute his knowledge that a claim had been filed by the Pursers and that\n\ndiscovery was ongoing. His contention is that he had no duty to preserve the recorder because the\n\nPursers did not show that he knew or should have known that the recorder would have been\n\n“material and relevant to that claim.”\n\n               Scarbrough acknowledged on the record at Deaton’s third deposition that he had a\n\nduty to determine what was on the recorder. He knew that appellees had requested production of\n\nwitness statements, and he stated that Deaton had produced the recorder to him shortly after her\n\nsecond deposition, representing to him that it contained a recording of a conversation that she and\n\nher sister Kathy Perdue had with Purser Sr., i.e., a recording with statements from two parties to the\n\nlawsuit (the “sister recording”). Deaton’s recollection differed. In her second deposition, Deaton\n\ntestified that she had given a tape recording to Scarbrough shortly before that deposition began18 and\n\nthat she could not remember what was on that recording: “I would have to relisten to it. I do not\n\nremember what all is on it.” Scarbrough produced that recording and acknowledged that he had a\n\nduty to find out what was on “the tape” (“I think I have an obligation to my client and to you to see\n\nwhether or not . . . there are recordings on there that are pertinent to this lawsuit that are not\n\nfrivolous”).19 Scarbrough further said it was “absolutely true” that if a lawyer is holding onto\n\nevidence, he is charged with knowledge of what is in that evidence.\n\n\n\n\n       18\n         Deaton changed her testimony in her third deposition, stating that she could not remember\nwhen she gave the recorder to Scarbrough.\n       19\n           Deaton also identified a separate recording of Purser Sr. that was made at her request by\nher first attorney, John Redington. The “Redington recording” was not made with the digital\nrecorder but on an analog (microcassette) recorder.\n\n                                                 39\n\f               But the record shows that Scarbrough failed to perform any inquiry into how many\n\nrecordings were on the device and “just assumed that there was one.” He testified that having the\n\nrecorder “sure would be helpful” and “it would be really great if we could find that recorder and see\n\nwhat, if anything, was on it.” He never asked Steele, the owner of the device, about the recorder or\n\nany recordings she had previously made with it: “I don’t know that Ms. Steele ever talked to me\n\nabout it.”20 He never asked his IT tech, Shawn Richeson, how many files or recordings were on the\n\ndevice. But Richeson’s January 11, 2011 billing states “7 individual audio files recovered from USB\n\ndigital recorder and returned recorder to Jerry.” Scarbrough testified that he paid Richeson.\n\n               Scarbrough did not ask Deaton to preserve the recorder when he returned it to her.\n\nAlthough the recorder was in good working condition, was not “cheap,” and belonged to Steele,\n\nDeaton testified that sometime between March and April 2011 the recorder “either went to Goodwill\n\nor it went in my trash.” Meanwhile, Scarbrough continued insisting that as far as he knew, he had\n\nproduced everything appellees requested. For over six weeks between the time that Deaton told him\n\nthat she had disposed of the recorder and the time of the first sanctions hearing, Scarbrough said\n\nnothing to opposing counsel about the lost recorder. When Scarbrough was asked what actions he\n\ntook to preserve it, he testified that he asked Richeson to make a CD of it and that he wrote a letter\n\nto Deaton in July 2011 (after she had already disposed of it) asking her to preserve the recorder.\n\n\n               1. The recorder was material\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the recorder was duplicative of information already\n\nprovided to appellees from Richeson’s server and was not material. “Material evidence” has been\n\n\n       20\n          This is consistent with Steele’s testimony that she did not converse with Scarbrough about\nthe recorder.\n\n                                                 40\n\fdefined as “[e]vidence having some logical connection with the facts of the case or the legal issues\n\npresented.” Material Evidence, Black’s Law Dictionary 676 (10th ed. 2014). Contrary to\n\nScarbrough’s view, the recorder was material evidence and was not merely duplicative. No witness\n\nwho had possession or control of the digital recorder confirmed that the recordings on Richeson’s\n\nserver duplicated everything that had been on the recorder. In fact, there was evidence suggesting\n\nfiles were deleted from the recorder. Steele testified that she had taped “several” real estate classes\n\nshe was attending “on that particular recorder” and none of those recordings were included in what\n\nRicheson recovered from it. Another recording that was not among the files that Richeson recovered\n\nwas one that Deaton testified she had made of Purser Sr. making a settlement offer to her to drop her\n\ncounterclaims. Richeson testified that files could be deleted from the recorder, that it is possible to\n\nrecover deleted files from the recorder, that he did not attempt to recover any deleted files because\n\nhe was not asked to check for files that were deleted, and that determining what had been on the\n\ndigital recorder required the recorder itself. Testimony about another claimed discrepancy came\n\nfrom Scarbrough, who stated that the CD that Richeson provided to him differed from the CD with\n\nthe recordings provided to the appellees. Only with the recorder, Richeson said, could he confirm\n\nwhether Scarbrough’s CD contained all of the recordings that were recovered from the device.\n\nBased on this evidence, the trial court would not have abused its discretion in finding that the\n\nrecorder was evidence that had a logical connection with the facts of or legal issues presented in the\n\nPurser Family’s suit and Scarbrough knew or should have known the recorder was material.\n\n\n               2. The recorder was relevant\n\n               Scarbrough next contends that the recorder was not relevant. “Relevant evidence”\n\nis evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\n\n                                                  41\n\fdetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 401. If there is a logical connection either directly or by inference between the\n\nevidence and a fact to be proved, the evidence is relevant. Clark v. Randalls Food, 317 S.W.3d 351,\n\n357 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). The Purser Family’s suit alleged in part\n\nthat Scarbrough’s clients Deaton and Steele initiated an inappropriate relationship with Purser Sr.\n\nand financially exploited him while he suffered from dementia. Portions of the recordings that\n\nRicheson obtained from the recorder depicted conversations between Deaton, Steele, and Purser Sr.\n\nsupporting the Purser Family’s allegations.\n\n               Based on the witness statements that were recovered from the recorder, all of the\n\nevidence presented during the three-day hearing, and reasonable inferences drawn from that\n\nevidence, the district court would not have abused its discretion in determining that evidence not\n\nrecovered from the recorder before Deaton disposed of it was at least potentially relevant to the\n\nPurser Family’s claims and that Scarbrough knew or should have known that the recorder was\n\nrelevant.   See IQ Holdings, Inc. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., 451 S.W.3d 861, 868 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (concluding that appellee’s attorney had duty to preserve\n\ndocuments that were at least potentially relevant to appellant’s claims against appellees); Clark,\n\n317 S.W.3d at 357.\n\n               The evidence in this record, considered in the light most favorable to the trial court’s\n\nruling, contains more than a scintilla of evidence showing that Scarbrough knew or should have\n\nknown that he had a duty to preserve the digital recorder, which was material and relevant to the\n\nlawsuit, and that he failed to do so. The evidence further shows that the district court’s spoliation\n\ninstruction was based on more than a scintilla of evidence that Scarbrough failed to preserve the\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fdigital recorder and had a duty to preserve it when he returned it to Deaton. There is proof of\n\nScarbrough’s willful blindness as to the recorder, i.e., that he did not directly destroy evidence\n\nknown to be relevant and discoverable, but nonetheless allowed for its destruction. See Aldridge,\n\n438 S.W.3d at 24-25. Scarbrough avoided knowledge of what was on the digital recorder by failing\n\nto perform any inquiry into its contents, not even asking Steele, the owner of the recorder, or\n\nRicheson, who recovered the information for Scarbrough from the recorder, what recordings had\n\nbeen on it or recovered from it. Scarbrough knew from Deaton’s deposition that the recorder\n\ncontained statements from parties to the lawsuit (herself and Purser Sr.), and that she did not\n\nremember “what all was on it.” Despite that testimony, Scarbrough “just assumed that there was\n\none,” choosing not to confirm whether other recorded statements might be on the device. Then\n\nwhile discovery was ongoing, Scarbrough returned the recorder not to its owner but to Deaton,\n\nsaying nothing to her about preserving it until his letter months later, ultimately allowing for her\n\ndisposal of it. Because this record disproves it, we overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that “no\n\nevidence” supported the spoliation instruction.\n\n\nB. Sufficient evidence of recordings that were not produced\n\n               Scarbrough contends that there is no evidence that he destroyed evidence or that the\n\nPurser Family was deprived of evidence he was accused of spoliating. However, as previously\n\ndiscussed, there was evidence indicating that files were deleted from the recorder: Steele testified\n\nthat real-estate classes she recorded were not among the files that Richeson recovered, and Deaton\n\ntestified that her recording of a settlement offer that Purser Sr. made to her was not recovered either.\n\nAs Richeson made clear, there is no way to determine what had been on the recorder, i.e., what\n\nevidence the Purser Family was deprived of, without the device itself. We overrule Scarbrough’s\n\n                                                  43\n\fcomplaint that there is no evidence that he destroyed evidence or that the Purser Family was deprived\n\nof evidence he was accused of spoliating.\n\n\nC. Discovery-abuse sanctions against Scarbrough\n\n               In five separate orders, the district court awarded Helen monetary sanctions totaling\n\n$54,261.50 for Scarbrough’s discovery abuse, pursuant to the court’s inherent authority and Texas\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 215. Scarbrough’s final set of issues challenges the imposition of sanctions\n\nagainst him in three of those orders, which imposed sanctions of $25,000, $15,959.50, and $11,000.21\n\nScarbrough contends: (1) sanctions imposed for failure to produce all the requested recordings were\n\nnot “just”; (2) sanctions imposed for disclosure of Purser’s medical records were not “just” and his\n\ndisclosure to Bolling was minimal and inconsequential; and (3) the Purser Family lacked standing\n\nto request sanctions for disclosure of Purser Sr.’s medical records.\n\n               A trial court may impose sanctions on any party that abuses the discovery process in\n\nseeking, making, or resisting discovery.        See Tex. R. Civ. P. 215.3; Wein v. Sherman,\n\nNo. 03-10-00499-CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 10666, at *39 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 23, 2013, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.) (noting that Rule 215 sanctions are not damages for harm alleged in underlying\n\nlawsuit but are used to punish parties who violate discovery rules). A trial court also has inherent\n\npower to sanction to the extent necessary to deter, alleviate, and counteract bad faith abuse of the\n\njudicial process. IFC Credit Corp. v. Specialty Optical Sys., Inc., 252 S.W.3d 761, 772 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied) (citing Eichelberger v. Eichelberger, 582 S.W.2d 395, 398 (Tex.\n\n\n       21\n           Scarbrough failed to brief and has waived any challenge to two other sanctions orders:\n(1) an order imposing sanctions of $1,150 against him for filing a frivolous motion for sanctions, and\n(2) an order imposing sanctions of $1,152 against him for filing a frivolous motion for leave to\ndesignate responsible third parties.\n\n                                                 44\n\f1979)). We review sanctions imposed under Rule 215 or the court’s inherent power for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Koslow’s v. Mackie, 796 S.W.2d 700, 704 (Tex. 1990). We reverse the trial court’s\n\nruling only if the court acted without reference to any guiding rules or principles, such that its ruling\n\nwas arbitrary or unreasonable. American Flood Research, Inc. v. Jones, 192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex.\n\n2006). Imposition of sanctions is appropriate (1) if there is a direct relationship between the\n\nimproper conduct and the sanctions imposed—i.e., the sanctions must be directed against the abuse\n\nand abuser and be tailored to remedy any prejudice the abuse caused—and (2) if the sanctions are\n\nnot excessive—i.e., the punishment should fit the crime. TransAmerican Nat. Gas Corp. v. Powell,\n\n811 S.W.2d 913, 917 (Tex. 1991).\n\n\n                1. Sanctions for failure to produce requested recordings were “just”\n\n                Scarbrough contends that the $25,000 sanctions award was not “just” because he did\n\nnot know that the recorder was relevant and material, requiring preservation. However, as we have\n\ndiscussed, the recorder was material evidence and was not merely duplicative—no witness who had\n\npossession or control of the digital recorder confirmed that the recordings on Richeson’s server\n\nduplicated everything that had been on the recorder, and there was evidence indicating that files were\n\ndeleted from the recorder. We have also discussed that the evidence not recovered from the recorder\n\nbefore Deaton disposed of it was at least potentially relevant to the Purser Family’s claims, as\n\nindicated by the recordings that were recovered, and that Scarbrough knew or should have known\n\nthat the recorder was relevant. See IQ Holdings, Inc., 451 S.W.3d at 868; Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 357.\n\n                Scarbrough attempts to shift the blame to others for failure to produce recordings\n\nduring discovery. However, the court’s order specified that Scarbrough was also being sanctioned\n\n\n\n                                                   45\n\ffor “his intentional concealment and deception regarding the existence of audio recordings,” conduct\n\nthat did not implicate anyone else. Actions that callously disregard the rules of discovery warrant\n\na presumption that the actor’s claims are meritless because the very purpose of discovery is “to seek\n\nthe truth, so that disputes may be decided by what the facts reveal, not by what facts are concealed.”\n\nKhan v. Valliani, 439 S.W.3d 528, 533 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.). With\n\nregard to the order’s omission of reference to consideration of lesser sanctions, we note that\n\nScarbrough did not raise that complaint below and he has waived it here. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n33.1(a); Werley v. Cannon, 344 S.W.3d 527, 535 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.) (concluding\n\nthat appellant waived his complaint that trial court did not consider less stringent sanctions by failing\n\nto object on that basis below); see also Bell v. Doreman, No. 94-50358, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 42994,\n\nat *4 (5th Cir. Aug. 15, 1994) (stating court need not address issues that were not considered by\n\ndistrict court and noting, “Bell’s argument, that the district court failed to consider lesser sanction,\n\nwas not presented to the district court.”); The Shops at Legacy (Inland) Ltd.

(collecting cases on waiver of\n\nappellate complaints about sanctions).\n\n                Further, the fees awarded were not excessive. Crews and Ray, the Purser Family’s\n\nattorneys, testified about their hourly rates and detailed their nearly year-long efforts in obtaining\n\ndiscovery, resulting in their request for fees totaling $53,000. The court’s award of $25,000 was far\n\nless than the total amount of those fees. Scarbrough failed to demonstrate that the court acted\n\nwithout reference to guiding rules and principles in issuing these sanctions. See American Flood\n\nResearch, 192 S.W.3d at 583. We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that the $25,000 sanctions\n\n\n                                                   46\n\faward was not “just” because he did not know that the recorder was relevant and material,\n\nrequiring preservation.\n\n\n               2. Sanctions for disclosure of Purser’s medical records were “just”\n\n               Scarbrough’s next two issues complain about the court’s orders imposing sanctions\n\nof $15,959.50 and $11,000 for twice violating the court’s order on the confidentiality of Purser Sr.’s\n\nmedical records: once to Officer Sharon Brank of the Killeen Police Department and then to\n\nCarolyn Bolling, Purser Sr.’s niece. During the sanctions hearings, Scarbrough admitted he was\n\nbound by the court order, but he claimed he had to divulge the medical records to a law-enforcement\n\nexpert to obtain the autopsy he wanted performed on Purser Sr. However, Scarbrough testified that\n\nthe medical records “were of limited value.” Scarbrough minimizes his disclosure to Bolling as a\n\n“slip of the tongue.” The trial court was not persuaded that Scarbrough’s disclosure was inadvertent.\n\nAfter listening to Scarbrough’s entire recorded conversation with Bolling, the court stated that\n\nScarbrough had quoted from the medical records in an apparent attempt to prejudice a witness.\n\nSignificantly, both of these medical-record disclosures were made along with Scarbrough’s false and\n\ndefamatory statements about the Purser Family in an alleged attempt to prove that Purser Sr. did not\n\nhave dementia. But Scarbrough’s recorded conversation with his wife revealed that not even\n\nScarbrough himself believed that theory. Scarbrough failed to demonstrate that the court acted\n\nwithout reference to guiding rules and principles in issuing these sanctions. See id. We overrule\n\nScarbrough’s complaint that the $15,959.50 and $11,000 sanctions awards were not “just.”22\n\n\n       22\n          Scarbrough’s argument about the order’s omission of a reference to consideration of lesser\nsanctions was not raised below and is waived. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Werley v. Cannon,\n344 S.W.3d 527, 535 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2011, no pet.); see also Bell v. Doreman, No. 94-50358,\n1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 42994, at *4 (5th Cir. Aug. 15, 1994); The Shops at Legacy (Inland) Ltd.\n\n                                                 47\n\f                3. Standing to seek sanctions\n\n                Scarbrough cites no authority for his argument that a violation of a court’s\n\nconfidentiality order is unenforceable unless the violation causes injury to someone, thereby\n\nproviding them with standing to seek sanctions, and that Helen lacked such standing. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 38.1(i). This argument also overlooks the fact that Helen’s confidential information was\n\nalso included in the records, including marriage counseling and other personal incidents between\n\nthem, and she would have standing to protect the confidentiality of her own information. Scarbrough\n\nfailed to demonstrate that the court acted without reference to guiding rules and principles in issuing\n\nthese sanctions. See American Flood Research, 192 S.W.3d at 583. We overrule Scarbrough’s\n\ncomplaint that Helen lacked standing to seek sanctions for his violations of the court’s\n\nconfidentiality order.\n\n\n                            VI. Waiver of remaining appellate issues\n\n                Of the 40 or so appellate issues that Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton raise, a number\n\nare waived.\n\n\nA. Appellants waived misjoinder complaint\n\n                Appellants contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the Purser Family’s\n\nthird-party claims against them because they were not liable for all or part of Olvera’s claims against\n\nPurser Sr. in the original lawsuit. However, the Purser Family correctly notes that misjoinder of\n\nactions is a procedural, not jurisdictional matter. See Allison v. Arkansas La. Gas Co., 624 S.W.2d 566,\n\n\nP’ship v. Fine Autographs & Memorabilia Retail Stores, Inc., No. 05-14-00889-CV, 2015 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 4724, at *5-6 (Tex. App.—Dallas May 8, 2015, pet. denied) (mem. op.).\n\n\n                                                  48\n\f568 (Tex. 1981); Ford Motor Co. v. Texas Dep’t of Transp., 936 S.W.2d 427, 432 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 1996, no writ) (noting that any impediments to joining administrative claims with\n\ncounterclaims would not be jurisdictional); see also University of Tex. at Austin v. Hinton,\n\n822 S.W.2d 197, 200 (Tex. App.—Austin 1991, no writ) (concluding that misjoinder complaint\n\nraised for first time on appeal was waived). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 41, misjoinder of\n\nparties may be addressed on a party’s motion or on the court’s own initiative before submission of\n\nthe case, allowing improperly joined actions to be severed and each ground of recovery improperly\n\njoined to be docketed as a separate suit between the same parties. Tex. R. Civ. P. 41. Steele and\n\nDeaton raise the issue of misjoinder for the first time on appeal and have waived it. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a); Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 200.23\n\n               Unlike Steele and Deaton, Scarbrough filed a motion for severance. But it did not\n\nraise his appellate complaint—that the Purser Family’s third-party claims against him were\n\nimproperly joined because he was not liable for all or part of Olvera’s claims against\n\nPurser Sr.—rather, the motion contended only that severance was proper because he had inadequate\n\ntime to prepare his defense. With this motion, Scarbrough preserved nothing about his misjoinder\n\ncomplaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 200. Scarbrough’s misjoinder\n\ncomplaint is waived.24\n\n\n       23\n           We note that the case appellants cite in support of their contention that misjoinder is a\njurisdictional issue was decided before the promulgation of Rule 41.\n       24\n           Even if he had preserved this issue, we review a trial court’s severance ruling for an abuse\nof discretion, see Liberty Nat’l Fire Ins. Co. v. Akin, 927 S.W.2d 627, 629 (Tex. 1996), which is not\nshown on this record. Scarbrough’s motion for severance was denied on the same day that the\ndistrict court signed Olvera’s nonsuit and dismissal with prejudice of his claims against Purser Sr.,\nleaving only the Purser Family’s third-party claims against appellants in the suit. Thus, there was\nnothing for the district court to sever.\n\n                                                  49\n\fB. Scarbrough waived Rule 13 sanctions complaint\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion\n\nfor Rule 13 sanctions, but the record shows that Scarbrough withdrew that motion:\n\n\n       THE COURT:            Okay, the next matter has to do with Mr. Scarbrough’s Motion\n                             for Sanctions for allegedly filing frivolous pleadings under\n                             Rule 13. I’ve read the motion. I’ve read the response.\n                             Mr. Scarbrough, did you wish to make argument?\n\n       SCARBROUGH:           Your Honor, I’m going to withdraw that motion.\n\n       THE COURT:            The motion is withdrawn. The Court grants you[] permission\n                             to withdraw the motion.\n\n\nScarbrough waived his Rule 13 sanctions complaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n\nC. Scarbrough waived issue that discovery sanctions restricted his access to the courts\n\n               Scarbrough contends for the first time on appeal that the sanctions imposed against\n\nhim for discovery abuse were excessive and unconstitutional because they restricted his access to the\n\ncourts. He contends, citing no authority, that the post-judgment filing of his affidavit of net worth,\n\nwhile “not a formal notice that the sanctions assessed precluded access to the courts, [] should be\n\nconsidered such a request.” Scarbrough waived his complaint that the discovery sanctions restricted\n\nhis access to the courts. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fD. Steele and Deaton waived spoliation-instruction issue\n\n               Steele and Deaton contend that the district court erred in giving a spoliation\n\ninstruction because there is no evidence that Steele had custody of the digital recorder or failed to\n\npreserve it, and because there is no evidence that Deaton had a duty to preserve the recorder when\n\nshe disposed of it. However, they did not raise the arguments they are making here in their motion\n\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict and failed to otherwise preserve them for appellate review.\n\nSee id.; B & W Supply, Inc. v. Beckman, 305 S.W.3d 10, 14 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009,\n\npet. denied) (concluding that issue in JNOV differed from issue asserted on appeal and was waived);\n\nLee v. Lee, 47 S.W.3d 767, 776-77 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (refusing\n\nto consider appellate complaint distinct from complaint in JNOV that there was no evidence to\n\nsupport jury’s finding). Steele and Deaton waived their complaint that the district court erred in\n\ngiving a spoliation instruction. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               We affirm the awards of past mental anguish damages for defamation totaling\n\n$1,060,000 ($180,000 against Steele, $180,000 against Deaton, and $700,000 against Scarbrough),\n\nreverse the portions of the judgment awarding the other compensatory damages to the Purser Family\n\nagainst Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton, and render judgment that as to the compensatory damages,\n\nthe Purser Family take only the $1,060,000 awarded for past mental anguish for defamation. We\n\nmodify the exemplary damages awarded against Scarbrough to $700,000, against Steele to $200,000,\n\nand against Deaton to $200,000 by applying the statutory cap and affirm the awards as modified.\n\nFinally, we affirm the district court’s orders imposing discovery-abuse sanctions against Scarbrough\n\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fin the amounts of $25,000, $15,959.50, $11,000, $1,150, and $1,152 and its order imposing\n\ndiscovery-abuse sanctions against Deaton in the amount of $5,000.\n\n\n\n                                      __________________________________________\n                                      Jeff Rose, Chief Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Rose, Justices Field and Bourland\n\nAffirmed in Part; Modified and, as Modified, Affirmed in Part; Reversed and Rendered in Part\n\nFiled: December 30, 2016\n\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\f",

Purser a/k/a Sue E. Van Zanten; Gary W. Purser, Jr.;\n                     JoAnn M. Purser; and Elizabeth H. Tipton, Appellees\n\n\n      FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF BELL COUNTY, 146TH JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n          NO. 236,117-B, HONORABLE ALAN MAYFIELD, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n                 Attorney Jerry Scarbrough and his former clients, Melissa Victoria Deaton1\n\nand Denise Steele,2 appeal from a jury verdict in favor of Helen Purser, Sue E. Purser a/k/a\n\nSue E. Van Zanten, Gary W. Purser Jr., JoAnn M. Purser, and Elizabeth H. Tipton (the Purser\n\nFamily) on claims of fraud, defamation, and defamation per se. The Purser Family’s suit asserted\n\ndefamation and fraud claims arising from allegations that Deaton and Steele initiated an\n\ninappropriate relationship with family patriarch Gary W. Purser, Sr.3 and financially exploited him\n\n\n       1\n        Appellants’ counsel filed a suggestion of death for Deaton, stating a presumption that\nDeaton would want this appeal to continue.\n       2\n          Counsel for appellants stated at oral argument that Steele’s last name has changed to Pierce.\nFor clarity, we will refer to this appellant by her former last name, consistent with the evidence, jury\ncharge, and judgment in this case.\n       3\n           Purser Sr. was Helen’s husband, the father of Elizabeth, Gary Jr., and Sue, and the\nfather-in-law of JoAnn, who is married to Gary Jr.\n\fwhile he suffered from dementia. The suit alleged that Scarbrough, the attorney who represented\n\nDeaton and Steele, conspired with his clients and also that he defamed the Purser Family by accusing\n\nthem of abusing and murdering Purser Sr. The jury’s final judgment held Scarbrough, Steele, and\n\nDeaton jointly and severally liable for defamation and fraud based on the jury’s findings that they\n\nacted in concert or in conspiracy. The jury also found that appellants acted with malice or gross\n\nnegligence and awarded exemplary damages of $13.5 million. Additionally, the court ordered\n\nsanctions totaling $54,261.50 against Scarbrough and $5,000 against Deaton for discovery abuse.\n\n               In a voluminous and rambling appeal, Scarbrough raises 26 issues and Steele and\n\nDeaton raise 14 overlapping ones, primarily challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\nthe jury’s findings.4 They contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the Purser Family’s\n\nclaims and that the court should not have given a spoliation instruction. They also contend that there\n\nwas no evidence to support a variety of the jury’s findings and no clear-and-convincing evidence of\n\nappellants’ actual malice or gross negligence.\n\n               Scarbrough separately contends that the court erred by denying his requested question\n\nand instruction on his claim that, as an attorney, he should have qualified immunity, and that there\n\nwas no clear-and-convincing evidence he made any statement that was perceived as tending to affect\n\na person injuriously or charging a person with illegal or immoral conduct. Scarbrough also contends\n\nthat there was no basis for the discovery sanctions awards against him, that the Purser Family lacked\n\nstanding to seek sanctions, that the exemplary damage and sanctions awards against him are\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Steele and Deaton’s brief identifies fifteen issues but skips number thirteen, lists the\n“fourth issue” twice, and wholly omits their fraud-by-failure-to-disclose issue.\n\n                                                  2\n\fexcessive and unconstitutional, that the court abused its discretion by denying his requested Rule 13\n\nsanctions, and that he was entitled to “immunity from prosecution” for his report about Purser, Sr.\n\nto Adult Protective Services.\n\n                For the reasons that follow, we will reverse the portions of the judgment awarding\n\ncompensatory damages to the Purser Family on their defamation and fraud claims against\n\nScarbrough, Steele, and Deaton, with the exception of the unchallenged awards of past mental\n\nanguish damages for defamation; reverse the exemplary damages awards against Steele and Deaton;\n\nmodify the exemplary damages award against Scarbrough by applying the statutory cap; and affirm\n\nthe district court’s orders imposing sanctions against Scarbrough and Deaton.\n\n\n                                         BACKGROUND5\n\nPurser Sr. meets Steele, Deaton, and Olvera\n\n                Gary Purser Sr., a successful land developer and owner of several construction\n\ncompanies in Killeen, was in his late 70s and alleged to be in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease\n\nwhen he met then 29-year old Denise Steele at the Red Lobster where she worked. Steele introduced\n\nPurser Sr. to her live-in boyfriend, Clayton Olvera, and to her friend, Melissa Deaton. Purser Sr.\n\neventually hired Olvera to manage a business called Freytag Irrigation. According to Olvera,\n\nPurser Sr. and Steele began a romantic relationship and met weekly at a hotel, then later at Deaton’s\n\nhome. Olvera testified that over time, Purser Sr. gave Steele jewelry, weekly payments of $500,\n\n$5,000 every other week for a car, money for attending real-estate classes and starting a sports bar,\n\n\n\n\n       5\n           The background is summarized from evidence in the record of this appeal.\n\n                                                  3\n\fand money to pay for cosmetic surgery. Steele admitted that Purser Sr. gave her money, but she\n\ndenied that he paid for any medical procedures. She testified that Purser Sr. told her he had made\n\nseveral men into millionaires and he wanted “to make [her] the first woman millionaire.” Steele and\n\nDeaton were recorded discussing a property-development scheme with Purser Sr. in which the\n\nwomen would split $2.5 million each (the “secret recording”). In that recording they also discussed\n\nhaving Purser Sr.’s children and a fantasy of traveling to Las Vegas together. During that same\n\ndiscussion they told Purser Sr. that when he died, he should not do as some people who leave all\n\ntheir money to a dog because he had Steele and Deaton. Steele and Olvera later broke up, and\n\nOlvera was eventually fired from Freytag. During this time, Purser Sr.’s family alleges that his\n\ndeteriorating health caused memory loss, disinhibition, hypersexuality, and behavior that was out\n\nof character for him.\n\n\nOlvera sues Purser Sr. and Purser Family files third-party claims\n\n               In a demand letter to the Purser Family after his firing from Freytag, Olvera\n\nthreatened to file a lawsuit—and in it revealed that Purser Sr., who was highly regarded in the\n\ncommunity, had carried on a secret affair with Steele and lavished money and gifts on her—unless\n\nthe family paid Olvera hundreds of thousands of dollars. Deciding to investigate the truth of\n\nOlvera’s allegations, the Purser Family monitored Purser Sr.’s location through his phone and\n\ndiscovered his numerous meetings with Steele at Deaton’s house. Before one such meeting,\n\nPurser Sr. told his family that he was going to Killeen, but his phone showed that he was on IH-35\n\ndriving to Temple. Tracking his travel, Purser Sr.’s daughter-in-law JoAnn arrived at Deaton’s\n\nhouse and called her husband Purser Jr. and her sister-in-law Elizabeth, who both joined her there.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fThey heard Purser Sr.’s voice outside the house, and they confronted Steele and Deaton in the\n\nbackyard. JoAnn videotaped the confrontation. When Steele told JoAnn that she and Purser Sr.\n\nwere “just friends,” JoAnn became upset and cursed at her, believing that the “two women were\n\ntaking advantage of an old man.” Deaton called 911, reporting that people were attacking her.\n\nJoAnn also called 911 to clarify that Deaton was not being attacked, that Steele and Deaton “were\n\ntaking advantage of an older man with a problem” and that his family was trying to get him away\n\nfrom them.\n\n               About two months later, after the family told Purser Sr. that they had put a GPS\n\ndevice on his vehicle, Helen Purser called JoAnn to report that money was missing from their safe,\n\nthat Purser Sr. had driven away, and that she wanted to know where Deaton lived. JoAnn testified\n\nthat she did not want her 75-year-old mother-in-law driving to Temple, so she told Helen that she\n\nwould follow up on the matter. GPS showed JoAnn that Purser Sr. drove to his business office.\n\nWhen JoAnn arrived, staff told her that Purser Sr. had borrowed keys to a truck he did not usually\n\ndrive. Thinking that he had switched vehicles to avoid the GPS, JoAnn drove to Temple and parked\n\nacross the street from Deaton’s house, waiting to confirm whether that was Purser Sr.’s destination.\n\n               Purser Sr. arrived in the truck and parked in Deaton’s driveway. JoAnn walked up\n\nto the driver’s side window of the truck where she saw Purser Sr. counting out $100 bills into three\n\npiles on his lap, $9,300 in all, which she presumed he planned to give to Steele or Deaton. After\n\nPurser Sr. refused to exit the truck, JoAnn knocked at Deaton’s door, identified herself, and stated\n\nthat Purser Sr. was there with money and she wanted to know what was going on. Deaton did not\n\nanswer and JoAnn walked back to the truck, where she did not see the money. Purser Sr. told her\n\nthat he had hidden it and she would not find it. JoAnn entered the passenger side of the truck, found\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fthe money in an envelope in the glove compartment, and struggled with Purser Sr., telling him that\n\nthey needed to go home and sort things out. Eventually, JoAnn took the envelope and got into her\n\ncar with Purser Sr. at her window demanding the money. JoAnn had begun to “creep away” in the\n\ncar when the police arrived. Deaton had called 911 reporting that JoAnn was dragging Purser Sr.\n\ndown the street with her car and probably had weapons. JoAnn testified that no charges were filed\n\nbecause the first-responding officer’s dash-cam video, reviewed by all three responding officers at\n\nthe scene, showed that JoAnn had not dragged Purser Sr.6\n\n               Before confirming Purser Sr.’s meetings with Steele and Deaton, the Purser Family\n\nhad noticed Purser Sr. doing some unusual things: attempting to sell the same property to two\n\ndifferent buyers, losing his way home from a funeral (while driving through the town in which he\n\nhad developed several subdivisions), and giving faulty instructions to employees. His family took\n\nhim to a doctor who diagnosed Purser Sr. with early signs of Alzheimer’s, a form of dementia.\n\n               Olvera eventually followed through on his litigation threat, filing a breach-of-contract\n\nand tortious-interference suit against Purser Sr., Freytag Irrigation, and the Purser Family Trust. The\n\nPurser Family subsequently filed third-party claims against Steele and Deaton. Lawyer Scarbrough\n\nrepresented Steele and Deaton in the suit, but he withdrew from that representation after he was also\n\nnamed a defendant.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         Deaton made other 911 calls accusing JoAnn of threatening to kill her and assaulting her.\nPolice investigations determined that Deaton’s allegations were false and phone records tended to\ndisprove the alleged death threat.\n\n                                                  6\n\fDefamation allegations and discovery sanctions\n\n               During the litigation, Purser Sr. developed pneumonia and died at a hospital. The\n\nnext day, Scarbrough sent a letter to Jack Crews, one of the lawyers for the Purser Family, requesting\n\nthat an autopsy be performed to confirm whether Purser Sr. had dementia.7 Scarbrough also\n\ncontacted Dan Carter, the director of the funeral home where Purser Sr.’s arrangements were\n\nunderway; Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen; the Temple Police Department; and the\n\nTexas Rangers, all to discuss Purser Sr.’s death. In each of these conversations, Scarbrough accused\n\nthe Purser Family of murdering Purser Sr. Scarbrough also reported to Adult Protective Services that\n\nthe Purser Family abused Purser Sr., and later in open court Scarbrough accused Purser Jr. and\n\nJoAnn Purser of being drug addicts. While JoAnn was running for election as a trustee on the\n\nKilleen Independent School District board, Scarbrough posted to YouTube a video of the backyard\n\nincident at Deaton’s house and audio of the 911 call that JoAnn placed during that incident.\n\n               Unknown to the Purser Family, before Purser Sr. died, Steele and Deaton told him\n\nin a recorded conversation that his family was after his money, that he could not trust his family, and\n\nthat the family wanted him institutionalized. The women urged him to put his money in a safe in\n\nDeaton’s house and come live with them. Purser Sr. allegedly began to believe what the women told\n\nhim and became suspicious of his family.\n\n               During discovery, Scarbrough had given a digital recorder that contained the\n\nabove-mentioned conversation to Shawn Richeson, his “IT guy,” to enhance clarity by removing\n\n\n       7\n          Scarbrough acknowledged that when he was serving as counsel for Deaton, he filed a\nmotion for appointment of a guardian ad litem contending that Purser Sr. was a mentally\nincapacitated person who lacked a guardian (even though Purser Sr. was represented by counsel at\nthe time). Also, in an accidental recording Scarbrough made while carrying a recorder Deaton gave\nhim, Scarbrough told his wife that Purser Sr. had dementia.\n\n                                                  7\n\fstatic and background noise. Richeson connected the recorder’s USB drive to his computer,\n\ndownloaded the contents of the recorder, and returned the recorder to Scarbrough. When Richeson\n\nlistened to the recording, he was concerned about what he heard and thought he recognized\n\nPurser Sr.’s voice. He told a Purser Family friend, John Fisher, that the recording sounded like a\n\ncouple of women trying to take advantage of an old man, and Richeson gave Fisher access to the\n\naudio file through the Internet, allowing Fisher and the Purser Family to listen to it. Fisher heard the\n\nrecording of the women telling Purser Sr. that his children were turning against him and intended\n\nto institutionalize him and testified that they sounded to him like “gold diggers.”\n\n                Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton repeatedly denied the existence of this recording in\n\ntheir discovery responses, depositions, and in sanctions hearings. Scarbrough initially told the Purser\n\nFamily’s counsel that all the tapes and audio recordings he had were already produced in discovery.\n\nBut during Deaton’s third deposition,8 Scarbrough stated that at one time Deaton had given him\n\npossession of a digital recorder, which he gave to his “IT guy” and returned to Deaton after\n\nproducing one recording from that device in discovery—and that he was now aware of another\n\nrecording on the device that he had not heard and had not yet produced. Deaton later told the court\n\nthat she had disposed of Steele’s digital recorder by giving it to Goodwill or throwing it in the trash.\n\n                At the subsequent sanctions hearings arising from this situation, Richeson testified\n\nthat without the digital recorder he could not confirm what recordings had been on it and that he no\n\n\n\n       8\n           Deaton’s deposition was taken three times, on December 14, 2010, January 7, 2011, and\nJune 29, 2011. Her first deposition ran for several hours but was suspended by agreement of counsel\nfor the re-taking of Clayton Olvera’s deposition. After Deaton’s second deposition, Elizabeth Tipton\nwas added to the lawsuit, resulting in the third setting. Her third deposition was ultimately\nsuspended because of Scarbrough’s announcement that Deaton had additional recorded witness\nstatements of Purser Sr. that had not been produced in discovery.\n\n                                                   8\n\flonger had on his server all that he had recovered from the recorder. At the end of the hearing, the\n\ndistrict court imposed $25,000 in sanctions against Scarbrough, $5,000 against Deaton for her\n\ndisposal of the digital recorder, and ruled a spoliation instruction could be included in the court’s\n\ncharge if the evidence at trial supported it (the court later determined that it did and gave the\n\ninstruction at trial). Scarbrough was also ordered to pay sanctions of $11,000 and $15,959.50 for\n\nviolating the court’s confidentiality order twice by disclosing information from Purser Sr.’s medical\n\nrecords to the Temple Police Department and to Purser Sr.’s niece, Carolyn Bolling (to whom\n\nScarbrough had misrepresented himself as Purser Sr.’s lawyer).\n\n               The case proceeded to a jury trial, resulting in a unanimous verdict for the Purser\n\nFamily, with a total of $19,440, 000.00 awarded. The lengthy jury trial gave rise to an even lengthier\n\nappeal, the numerous issues of which we address in turn.9\n\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n                                       I. Defamation issues\n\nA. Defamation of appellees individually\n\n               None of the appellants challenge the jury’s finding that they each made statements\n\nthat were defamatory and false. Rather, appellants contend that there is no evidence that such\n\ndefamatory statement identified any member of the Purser Family individually—i.e., appellants did\n\nnot specifically name each individual family member that they defamed—and that a defamatory\n\nstatement must be directed at the plaintiff as an ascertainable person to be actionable. However,\n\n\n\n       9\n          A bankruptcy court subsequently ruled that the judgment and sanctions orders against\nScarbrough are nondischargeable debts.

(not designated for publication) (“Publication does not require that the plaintiff be named, if\n\nthose who know the plaintiff and are acquainted with him understand that the defamatory publication\n\nreferred to him.”).\n\n                 Here, Elizabeth testified that Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen, told the\n\nPurser Family that Scarbrough had accused them of Purser Sr.’s murder. Cooke plainly understood\n\nwho Scarbrough was referring to when he accused the Purser Family of murder. Scarbrough himself\n\ntestified that he reported to the funeral home director Dan Carter, the Temple Police Department and\n\nthe Texas Rangers his accusation that the Purser Family had murdered their husband and father.\n\nScarbrough’s murder accusations against the Purser Family included Purser Sr.’s daughter-in-law,\n\nJoAnn. Scarbrough referred to the incident in which JoAnn struggled with Purser Sr. in the truck\n\noutside Deaton’s house as “evidence” supporting his accusation that JoAnn murdered her\n\nfather-in-law.\n\n                 Under these facts, there was no misunderstanding that Scarbrough’s defamatory\n\nstatements were directed at each of the Purser Family appellees. See Levine, 448 S.W.3d at 651-52.\n\nAs to Steele and Deaton, the jury heard the recording of the women telling Purser Sr. that his family\n\ncould not be trusted and wanted to institutionalize him or put him in a home because they wanted\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fhis money. The women referenced Purser Sr.’s wife, his children, and his daughter-in-law when\n\nmaking these statements. We overrule appellants’ complaint that none of the defamatory statements\n\non which the jury assessed liability identified any member of the Purser Family individually.\n\n\nB. Publication of defamatory or false statement\n\n               As we have noted, none of the appellants challenge the jury’s finding that they each\n\nmade statements that were defamatory and false. However, appellants contend that there is no\n\nevidence that their defamatory statements about the Purser Family were published. “Publication of\n\ndefamatory words means to communicate the words, either orally, in writing, or in print, to a third\n\nperson capable of understanding their defamatory import and in such a way that the third person\n\nwould understand.” Double Diamond, Inc. v. Van Tyne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746477\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746477/double-diamond-inc-v-van-tyne/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2003, no pet.). The instruction on publication in the charge required communication to a\n\nperson—other than the appellees—who is capable of understanding its meaning.\n\n               As to Scarbrough’s statements, the jury heard Scarbrough himself testify that he told\n\nthe Texas Rangers, the Temple Police Department, and Dan Carter, the director of the funeral home\n\nwhere Scarbrough’s arrangements were being made, about his accusation that the Purser Family had\n\nmurdered Purser Sr. Elizabeth testified that Bill Cooke, a justice of the peace in Killeen, told the\n\nPurser Family that Scarbrough had accused them of Purser Sr.’s murder. The jury heard the\n\nrecording of Scarbrough talking to Carolyn Bolling—a nonparty to the suit and niece of\n\nPurser Sr.—in which Scarbrough claimed that he represented Purser Sr. and stated that Purser Sr.’s\n\nfamily intentionally misled doctors and caused his death.\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f               As to Steele and Deaton, the jury heard the recording of the women telling\n\nPurser Sr.—a person other than the appellees—that his family could not be trusted and wanted to\n\ninstitutionalize him or put him in a home because they wanted his money, causing Purser Sr. to\n\nbecome very suspicious of his family members. Appellants’ contention that there is “no evidence”\n\nthat any defamatory or false statements about the Purser Family were published is not supported by\n\nthis record as the evidence shows the statements were made to Purser Sr. We overrule appellants’\n\ncomplaint that none of their defamatory statements were published.\n\n\nC. Clear-and-convincing evidence that Scarbrough committed defamation per se\n\n               The jury found that Scarbrough, in lodging his accusations against the Purser Family,\n\ncommitted defamation per se. Scarbrough contends that there is no clear-and-convincing evidence\n\nthat he made any statement that a witness perceived as tending to affect a person injuriously or\n\ncharging a person with illegal or immoral conduct. A false accusation of the commission of a\n\ncriminal act is defamatory per se. Leyendecker & Assocs., Inc. v. Wechter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755643\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755643/leyendecker-associates-inc-v-wechter/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374\n\n(Tex. 1984).\n\n               Here, the jury’s affirmative finding of defamation per se against Scarbrough is\n\nsupported by Scarbrough’s own testimony. He acknowledged his statements to Dan Carter accusing\n\nthe Purser Family of murdering Purser Sr. by overdosing him with drugs. Scarbrough also testified\n\nthat nothing in the record from any medical professional stated that the Purser Family was providing\n\nPurser Sr. too much medication, that he had no direct causation evidence of the Purser Family’s\n\ninvolvement with Purser Sr.’s demise, and that he had no opinion from an expert medical\n\nprofessional supporting his suspicion that the family had anything to do with Purser Sr.’s demise.\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\fThe jury also heard Scarbrough’s recorded conversation with Carolyn Bolling, the Pursers’ niece,\n\nin which Scarbrough accused the Purser Family of Purser Sr.’s murder. Finally, the jury heard the\n\ntestimony of Dr. Sharon L. Barber, M.D., who treated Purser Sr. during his last hospitalization and\n\nstated that she saw no signs that Purser Sr. was abused or neglected, that he had been cared for\n\n“[e]xceptionally well” by family members and a caregiver who was present twenty-four hours a day,\n\nand that there was no indication that Scarbrough was correct in his accusation about the Purser\n\nFamily having murdered Purser Sr. This evidence was sufficient to produce in the minds of the jury\n\na firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the Purser Family’s allegations—that Scarbrough\n\ncommitted defamation per se by falsely accusing the Purser Family of committing the crime of\n\nmurder. Further, there is no argument that the murder accusations Scarbrough communicated to\n\nCarter and Bolling were in any way privileged.10 We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that there is\n\nno clear-and-convincing evidence of his committing defamation per se.\n\n\nD. No immunity from defamation for Scarbrough’s report to Adult Protective Services\n\n               Scarbrough contends that he was entitled to statutory immunity for his report to Adult\n\nProtective Services that Purser Sr. was a victim of elder abuse. However, the record contains a letter\n\nfrom the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services stating its finding that “the allegations\n\nof Exploitation and Physical Abuse” of Purser Sr. “were INVALID.” The Department also stated\n\nthat “[a]ll allegations have been investigated and APS has no concerns at this time.”\n\n       10\n          Scarbrough contends for the first time in his post-submission briefing that his statements\nabout Purser Sr. were protected by “litigation immunity” because, as a pro se defendant, he had an\nattorney-client relationship with himself. That contention is novel but waived. See Romero v.

See Tex. Hum. Res. Code § 48.054(a); Byles,\n\n390 S.W.3d at 552; Howard, 2002 Tex. App. LEXIS 4891, at *18-20. Scarbrough failed to meet that\n\nburden. He contends that “there was no evidence that [he] knew that Mr. Purser was not in trouble.”\n\n(Emphasis added.). But that contention impermissibly shifts the burden of proof for his affirmative\n\ndefense and is no evidence of his good faith. Further, Scarbrough admitted in his September 26, 2011\n\ndeposition that he had not seen Purser Sr. for about five months before making the report and that\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fhis report was based on a remark from David Pace, his process server, who allegedly told him that\n\nPurser Sr. “was in real poor condition.” Scarbrough testified:\n\n\n       after David told me that, I was really shocked. And I was saddened. And I called the\n       Adult Protective Service, which is a State agency that has the job of\n       overseeing—protecting elderly people and adults. I called them . . . And I reported\n       it to them. . . . I reported that Mr. Purser was doing very poorly, according to my\n       process server, and that he seemed inappropriate—untimely for me—to me that he\n       would be acting or feeling that bad. And then I asked them to look into it or told\n       them about it.\n\n\nInformation in Pace’s alleged remark provided Scarbrough no “cause to believe” that the Purser\n\nFamily was abusing and exploiting Purser Sr., as Scarbrough reported to the Texas Department of\n\nFamily and Protective Services, and Scarbrough testified about no other basis for his report. See\n\nTex. Hum. Res. Code § 48.051(a). With no showing of good faith, we overrule Scarbrough’s\n\ncomplaint that he was entitled to statutory immunity for his report of elder abuse.\n\n\nE. Scarbrough was not entitled to his requested qualified-immunity instruction\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the district court erred by denying his requested question\n\nand instruction on qualified immunity for actions taken in his capacity as a lawyer for Steele and\n\nDeaton during his investigation and defense of the case including, in his view, the defamatory\n\nstatements he made against the Purser Family.

We agree that there was no evidence that the defamatory statements by Steele and Deaton,\n\nconsisting of their statements to Purser Sr., caused injury to the Purser Family’s reputations in the\n\npast or future, and we sustain their issue.\n\n                As to Scarbrough’s statements that were defamatory per se—accusing the family of\n\nelder abuse and murder—evidence of injury to reputation was unnecessary. Texas law presumes that\n\ndefamatory per se statements cause reputational harm and entitle a plaintiff to general damages,\n\nincluding loss of reputation and mental anguish. Burbage v.

However, that presumption yields only nominal damages. Id. The Texas Supreme Court has\n\ninstructed that beyond nominal damages, presumed damages are reviewed for evidentiary support.12\n\nId.

See Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259.

No evidence supporting injury to reputation\n\n               The Texas Supreme Court has cautioned that in defamation cases our review of a\n\njury’s discretionary damage awards remains important to protect free speech, and we must ensure\n\nthat noneconomic damages are not simply disguised disapproval of defendants, but compensation\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\ffor actual injuries. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259. In Burbage, the Court noted that while some\n\nevidence suggested community awareness and discussion of the defamatory statements, there was\n\nonly vague testimony about the actual impact of the defamation, the basis for which the damage\n\naward compensated. Id. at 262.\n\n                Similarly here, despite the appalling nature of Scarbrough’s assertions, we conclude\n\nthat there was no evidence supporting the jury’s findings of injury to the Purser Family’s reputations\n\nin the past and future. The evidence at trial did not demonstrate the actual impact of the defamation\n\non the Purser Family that would meet the Burbage standard. See id. We sustain Scarbrough’s\n\ncomplaint that there is no evidence his defamatory statements caused the Purser Family to sustain\n\ninjury to their reputations in the past and no evidence that they will likely sustain injury to their\n\nreputations in the future.\n\n                2. No evidence supporting damage amounts for future mental anguish\n\n                The jury also awarded the Purser Family damages for mental anguish in the past and\n\nfuture on their defamation claims. As noted above, the jury’s awards for mental anguish in the past,\n\nwhich total $1,060,000, will stand and none of the appellants challenge them.13 However, appellants\n\ndo contend that there is no evidence to support the jury’s award based on the Purser Family suffering\n\n\n\n\n        13\n          Appellants complain that the Purser Family did not segregate “mental disturbances” they\nsustained as a result of Purser Sr.’s death from “mental disturbances” caused by the appellants’ acts.\nHowever, it was appellants’ burden to object if they perceived that a broad-form damages question\nmixed valid and invalid elements of damages. See Burbage v. Burbage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255-56\n(Tex. 2014). Appellants’ failure to make that objection below waives this complaint. Even if it were\npreserved, appellants acknowledge that no Texas court has required such a segregation of\nmental-anguish damages.\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fmental anguish in the future. The jury awarded the following damages to the Purser Family for\n\nfuture mental anguish:\n\n\n\n HELEN                            Steele                 Deaton                  Scarbrough\n future mental anguish           $25,000                 $25,000                  $150,000\n\n\n SUE                               Steele                 Deaton                Scarbrough\n future mental anguish            $25,000                 $25,000                  $50,000\n\n\n PURSER JR.

See id. at 259. To\n\nsupport an award for future mental anguish, a plaintiff must demonstrate a reasonable probability of\n\nsuffering compensable mental anguish in the future. Adams v.

Mental anguish awards are\n\nnoneconomic damages that must be compensation for actual injuries and not simply a disguised\n\ndisapproval of the defendant. Burbage, 447 S.W.3d at 259.\n\n               We conclude that the evidence at trial did not show demonstrate a reasonable\n\nprobability that appellants’ defamatory statements would cause the Purser Family to suffer\n\ncompensable future mental anguish—i.e, a substantial disruption in daily routine or a high degree\n\nof mental pain and distress. See Adams, 265 S.W.3d at 917. We sustain appellants’ complaint that\n\nthere is no evidence to support the jury’s award of damages for the Purser Family’s suffering of\n\nmental anguish in the future.\n\n\n                                          II. Fraud issues\n\n               The jury found that each of the appellants committed fraud against Helen, Purser Sr.’s\n\nwidow, in two ways: (1) fraud by misrepresentation and (2) fraud by failure to disclose.\n\n\nA. Steele and Deaton waived fraud-by-failure-to-disclose issue\n\n               Steele and Deaton waived their issue regarding the jury’s finding of “fraud by failure\n\nto disclose” by wholly omitting any briefing of it. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). The jury was\n\ninstructed without objection that they could award damages based on a “Yes” answer for either the\n\n“fraud by misrepresentation” or “fraud by failure to disclose” theory. But Steele and Deaton failed\n\nto address the fraud-by-failure-to-disclose theory, which was an independent basis supporting the\n\njury’s answer to the fraud question. Thus, the liability finding against Steele and Deaton for fraud\n\nis unchallenged and must stand.\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fB. No evidence of Scarbrough’s fraud by misrepresentation or failure to disclose\n\n               Scarbrough contends that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s finding that he\n\ncommitted fraud by misrepresentation against Helen because there is no evidence he ever said\n\nanything to her. The charge instructed the jury that “fraud by misrepresentation” occurs when:\n\n\n       (A)     a party makes a material misrepresentation,\n\n       (B)     the misrepresentation is made with knowledge of its falsity or made\n               recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion, and\n\n       (C)     the misrepresentation is made with the intention that it should be acted on by\n               the other party, and\n\n       (D)     the other party acts in reliance on the representation and thereby\n               suffers injury.\n\n\n               We agree that there was no evidence at trial of Scarbrough saying anything directly\n\nto Helen, or that he made any misrepresentation to her. To the extent that the misrepresentation at\n\nissue here was the existence of the tape-recorded statements during litigation, that issue is covered\n\nin the sanctions analysis below. We sustain Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s finding that he committed fraud by misrepresentation against Helen.\n\n               Scarbrough further contends that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s finding\n\nthat he committed fraud by failure to disclose against Helen. The charge instructed the jury that\n\n“fraud by failure to disclose” occurs when:\n\n\n       (A)     a party fails to disclose a material fact within the knowledge of that party,\n\n       (B)     the party knows that the other party is ignorant of the fact and does not have\n               an equal opportunity to discover the truth,\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f        (C)     the party intends to induce the other party to take some action by failing to\n                disclose the fact, and\n\n        (D)     the other party suffers injury as a result of acting without knowledge of the\n                undisclosed fact.\n\n\nScarbrough contends there is no evidence that as opposing counsel for Steele and Deaton (or later\n\nas a defendant) he had a duty to disclose anything to Helen. Scarbrough notes that there is no private\n\nright of action for violation of the Texas attorney disciplinary rules, thus, any failure to produce\n\nwitness-statement recordings in discovery was not a “failure to disclose” that would support Helen’s\n\nfraud claim against him.

We agree that there was no evidence at trial that Scarbrough had a duty to disclose\n\nanything to Helen independent of her complaints about his discovery abuse, which were addressed\n\nby sanctions. We sustain Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s\n\nfinding that he committed fraud by failure to disclose against Helen.\n\n\nC. Fraud damages\n\n               Based on its finding of fraud, the jury awarded Helen damages for loss of community\n\nproperty and mental anguish (problematically, the jury was not asked to answer with amounts as to\n\neach appellant):\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\f               loss of community property        past mental anguish       future mental anguish\n HELEN                  $1.5 million                    $500,000                   $250,000\n\n\n\nAppellants challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s findings of loss of\n\ncommunity property and mental anguish, contending that there is no evidence that Helen sustained\n\nthese damages due to any fraud by appellants.\n\n               Based on our conclusion that there is insufficient evidence supporting the fraud claim\n\nagainst Scarbrough, the fraud damages for loss of community property and mental anguish against\n\nhim cannot stand.\n\n               As to Steele and Deaton, although they failed to brief the issue of liability, there is\n\nno evidence of any damages resulting from alleged fraud had they committed it, thus there are no\n\nfraud damages for loss of community property and mental anguish. While Steele and Deaton appear\n\nto have taken advantage of Purser Sr., the evidence is not sufficient to prove the elements of fraud.\n\nWe sustain Steele’s and Deaton’s complaint that there is no evidence supporting the jury’s damage\n\nfindings of loss of community property and mental anguish based on fraud.14\n\n\n                        III. Conspiracy issues on defamation and fraud\n\nNo evidence of conspiracy\n\n               The jury found that appellants were part of a conspiracy that damaged Helen Purser.\n\nAppellants contend that there was no evidence of conspiracy because there was “no evidence of any\n\n\n\n\n       14\n          Based on our resolution of the fraud issue, we need not address appellants’ contention that\nthere was no evidence that they acted in concert with one another in committing fraud.\n\n                                                 25\n\funderlying tort.” However, as we have noted, none of the appellants challenged the jury’s finding\n\nthat they each made statements that were defamatory and false (they argued only that their statements\n\ndid not name specific individuals, were not published, and were not defamatory per se). Thus, the\n\nunderlying torts of defamation and defamation per se—for which the jury made an unchallenged\n\naward of past mental anguish damages—survive this appeal.\n\n               The conspiracy question in the charge (conditioned on a finding of defamation,\n\ndefamation per se, or fraud) instructed the jury that:\n\n\n       To be part of a conspiracy, more than one person must have had knowledge of,\n       agreed to, and intended a common objective or course of action that resulted in the\n       damages to Helen Purser. One or more persons involved in the conspiracy must have\n       performed some act or acts to further the conspiracy.\n       Each co-conspirator is responsible for all acts done by any of the conspirators in\n       furtherance of the unlawful combination.\n\n\nAlthough appellants do not challenge the jury’s finding that they made false and defamatory\n\nstatements, the evidence showed that Steele and Deaton made their defamatory statements in a\n\nrecording with Purser Sr. around May 2010, before they met Scarbrough, and that Scarbrough made\n\nhis defamatory statements after Purser Sr.’s death in July 2011. Neither the evidence nor the timing\n\nof their statements supports a finding that when the statements were made, appellants had a common\n\nobjective to commit defamation.       We sustain appellants’ issue that there was no evidence\n\nof conspiracy.15\n\n\n\n\n       15\n         Based on our resolution of this issue, we need not address appellants’ contention that there\nwas no evidence that they acted in concert with one another in committing defamation.\n\n                                                 26\n\f                                 IV. Exemplary damages issues\n\nA. Malice or gross negligence\n\n               The jury found that the harm to the Purser Family resulted from malice or gross\n\nnegligence. Appellants contend that there is no clear-and-convincing proof supporting the jury’s\n\nfinding. The jury was instructed to answer the question on malice or gross negligence only if they\n\nunanimously answered “Yes” to the questions on defamation, defamation per se, or fraud. The\n\ncharge defined “clear and convincing evidence,” “malice,” and “gross negligence”:\n\n\n       “Clear and convincing evidence” means the measure or degree of proof that produces\n       a firm belief or conviction of the truth of the allegations sought to be established.\n\n       “Malice” means a specific intent by Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or\n       Jerry Scarbrough, to cause substantial injury or harm to Helen Purser,\n       Sue Van Zanten, Gary “Bubba” Purser, Jr., JoAnn Purser, or Elizabeth Tipton.\n\n       “Gross negligence” means an act or omission by Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or\n       Jerry Scarbrough,\n\n       (a)     which when viewed objectively from the standpoint of Melissa Deaton,\n               Denise Steele or Jerry Scarbrough at the time of its occurrence involves an\n               extreme degree of risk, considering the probability and magnitude of the\n               potential harm to others; and\n\n       (b)     of which Melissa Deaton, Denise Steele or Jerry Scarbrough has actual\n               subjective awareness of the risk involved, but nevertheless proceeds with\n               conscious indifference to the rights, safety, or welfare of others.\n\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 41.001 (defining “clear and convincing,” “malice,” and “gross\n\nnegligence”), 41.003 (setting forth standards for recovery of exemplary damages). Because we have\n\nalready sustained appellants’ no-evidence issues as to the jury’s damage awards for injury to\n\nreputation (past and future) and for future mental anguish, what remains are the unchallenged awards\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fon the defamation claims for past mental anguish. Exemplary damages based on these awards could\n\nhave been supported if the Purser Family showed by clear-and-convincing evidence that the harm\n\nfrom appellants’ defamatory statements was the result of gross negligence or malice. See Pitts\n\n& Collard, L.L.P. v. Schechter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 331 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2011, no\n\npet.); see also Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.003(a). A defendant’s repetition of false and\n\ndefamatory accusations about plaintiff’s “dishonest, unethical, and illegal behavior” can show\n\n“specific intent to injure” and support a jury’s finding of malice. Pitts, 369 S.W.3d at 331.\n\n\n               1. Steele and Deaton waived issue of gross negligence\n\n               Here, the jury made the unchallenged finding that Steele and Deaton made statements\n\nabout the Purser Family that were false and defamatory. The statements included telling Purser Sr.\n\nthat he could not trust his family, that his family was after his money, and that his family wanted him\n\ninstitutionalized. Steele and Deaton waived any issue as to whether there was clear-and-convincing\n\nevidence that they made these defamatory statements with gross negligence by failing to brief this\n\nissue. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i). The jury was asked whether the harm to the Purser Family\n\nresulted from malice or gross negligence. But on appeal, Steele and Deaton failed to brief any issue\n\nas to gross negligence, which was an independent basis for the awards of exemplary damages against\n\nthem. Thus the jury’s finding of gross negligence against Steele and Deaton is unchallenged and\n\nmust stand.\n\n\n               2. Clear-and-convincing evidence of Scarbrough’s malice\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the evidence supports the jury’s finding of malice because he\n\nshowed a “specific intent to injure” through his repeated false and defamatory statements accusing\n\n\n                                                  28\n\fthe Purser Family of elder abuse and murder. Cf. Pitts, 369 S.W.3d at 331. The jury heard\n\ndeposition testimony from Scarbrough about his murder accusations and a recording of a phone call\n\nto Carolyn Bolling that Scarbrough made two months after his deposition. In the recording—after\n\nstating that he represented Purser Sr.—Scarbrough told her that the Purser Family abused Purser Sr.,\n\nintentionally misled his doctors, and caused his death.\n\n               Scarbrough’s testimony showed that he persisted in making accusations that Purser\n\nSr. did not have dementia and was murdered by his family despite a lack of evidence and even\n\nScarbrough’s own admission that he had no medical evidence or medical-expert opinion to support\n\nthose accusations. And long before he made his accusations to the Pursers’ niece, a funeral director,\n\nand law enforcement, Scarbrough accidentally recorded himself admitting to his wife that Purser Sr.\n\nhad dementia. In addition to that recorded admission, the jury heard Scarbrough acknowledge during\n\nhis deposition that Purser Sr. had been diagnosed by his doctors with dementia. The jury also heard\n\nthat Scarbrough propounded interrogatories to the deceased Purser Sr.—more than a month after\n\nPurser Sr.’s death and knowing Purser Sr. was deceased—asking about Purser Sr.’s sexual activities\n\nand affairs, and that Scarbrough questioned Helen in a lengthy deposition—held just two months\n\nafter her husband’s death—about irrelevant matters such as her medical history and private\n\nintimacies with Purser Sr. The jury further heard Scarbough’s statement to his wife, which he\n\ninadvertently recorded, discussing certain Purser Family members and stating his intent to get “a\n\nmillion dollars from every one of those sons of bitches” in the lawsuit.\n\n               The evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding of\n\nmalice, shows that Scarbrough chose to defame the Purser Family with repeated murder accusations\n\nand attempted to obtain an autopsy to “disprove” Purser Sr. had dementia, despite Scarbrough’s own\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fopinion that Purser Sr. suffered from that condition. The evidence is sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of Scarbrough’s willfulness, and not that Scarbrough had a good-faith belief in his\n\nstatements. Further, the evidence was sufficient to produce in the minds of the jury a firm belief or\n\nconviction as to the truth of the allegations of malice—that Scarbrough, by making repeated\n\naccusations of illegal behavior against the Purser Family, had a specific intent to cause\n\nsubstantial injury or harm to them. See id. We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that there is no\n\nclear-and-convincing proof that he made his defamatory statements with malice.\n\n\nB. Exemplary damage awards\n\n               The jury unanimously awarded these exemplary damages:\n\n\n\n\n HELEN                             Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages             $1.5 million               $500,000                 $2 million\n\n\n SUE                               Steele                  Deaton                 Scarbrough\n exemplary damages               $500,000                 $250,000                 $1 million\n\n\n PURSER JR.

Because evidence of a defendant’s net worth is not a prerequisite to\n\na jury’s imposition of exemplary damages, we conclude that this factor was not determinative of the\n\nawards of exemplary damages against Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton. See Barnhart, 459 S.W.3d\n\nat 752.\n\n\n               2. Excessiveness\n\n               Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton also contend generally that courts “must consider a\n\npunishment that would deter and punish without being gratuitously excessive.” Bennett v. Reynolds,\n\nNo. 03-05-00034-CV, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 9213, at *13 (Tex. App.—Austin Nov. 18, 2010, no\n\npet.) (mem. op. on remand); see also Bunton v.

Silva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894613\"><a href=\"/opinion/894613/dillard-department-stores-inc-v-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (Tex. 2004) (citing Kraus, 616 S.W.2d at 910).\n\nIn addition to net worth (which we have addressed above), the charge instructed the jury to consider\n\n                                                32\n\fthe five Kraus factors: (1) the nature of the wrong; (2) the character of the conduct involved; (3) the\n\ndegree of appellants’ culpability; (4) the situation and sensibilities of the parties concerned; and\n\n(5) the extent to which such conduct offends a public sense of justice and propriety.\n\n\n               A. Kraus factors as to Scarbrough\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the wrong was his false and defamatory murder accusation. The\n\njury found by clear-and-convincing evidence that the character of Scarbrough’s conduct was\n\nmalicious and as part of its finding, that Scarbrough had a high degree of culpability based on his\n\n“specific intent” to cause substantial injury or harm to the Purser Family. We have concluded that\n\nthe evidence, detailed above, was sufficient to support that finding. The evidence at trial on the next\n\nfactor, the situation and sensibilities of the parties, also supports the jury’s award of exemplary\n\ndamages. The Purser Family, having endured the loss of Purser Sr., then had to deal with the\n\nhumiliation of being falsely and repeatedly accused by Scarbrough of causing Purser Sr.’s death.\n\nScarbrough’s own briefing concedes that this record is “replete with evidence of past damages” that\n\nthe Purser Family sustained based on defamation. Finally, regarding the last factor, we conclude that\n\nScarbrough’s repeatedly making false and defamatory murder accusations against the Purser Family\n\nin this case “offends a public sense of justice and propriety.” Scarbrough claimed to have made his\n\naccusations in an attempt to obtain an autopsy on Purser Sr. “disproving” his dementia. But\n\nScarbrough believed, as he told his wife, that Purser Sr. had dementia. No medical evidence or\n\nexpert supported Scarbrough’s murder accusations, and Scarbrough admitted in his deposition that\n\nPurser Sr. had been diagnosed by his doctors with dementia. Further, Scarbrough told Purser’s niece\n\nfour months after Purser Sr. died—when an autopsy was unlikely—that the Purser Family abused\n\nPurser Sr., intentionally misled his doctors, and caused his death.\n\n                                                  33\n\f               A rational jury could have found that Scarbrough’s repeated defamation of the Purser\n\nFamily was not designed to obtain an autopsy disproving Purser Sr.’s dementia, but rather to\n\nleverage his position in the underlying lawsuit. The jury heard Scarbrough admit that he made his\n\naccusations of abuse and exploitation to Adult Protective Services while he was representing Deaton\n\nand seeking a substantial sum of money from Purser Family members. The jury also heard\n\nScarbrough’s statement to his wife, which he inadvertently recorded, about his intent to get “a\n\nmillion dollars from every one of those sons of bitches.”17\n\n\n               B. Kraus factors as to Steele and Deaton\n\n               As to Steele and Deaton, the wrong was their defamation of the Purser Family in\n\ncommunicating to Purser Sr. Steele and Deaton told Purser Sr. that his family was after his money,\n\nthat his family wanted him institutionalized, and that his family could not be trusted. Steele and\n\nDeaton have not challenged the jury’s finding by clear-and-convincing evidence that their false and\n\ndefamatory statements were made with gross negligence. Further, there was sufficient evidence at\n\ntrial concerning the nature and character of Steele’s and Deaton’s conduct—i.e., defaming the Purser\n\nFamily to Purser Sr. to secure further financial gain—and the high degree of Steele’s and Deaton’s\n\nculpability for that conduct to support the jury’s award of exemplary damages. The evidence at trial\n\non the next factor, the situations and sensibilities of the parties, also supports the jury’s award of\n\n\n\n       17\n           The record shows that Scarbrough engaged in other conduct offensive to a public sense\nof justice and propriety, including: (1) his propounding interrogatories to the deceased Purser\nSr.—more than a month after Purser Sr.’s death and knowing Purser Sr. was deceased—asking about\nPurser Sr.’s sexual activities and affairs; and (2) his questioning of Helen—in a lengthy deposition\nheld just two months after her husband’s death—about irrelevant matters such as her medical history\nand private intimacies with Purser Sr.\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fexemplary damages. The jury had sufficient evidence to find that the situation and sensibilities of\n\nthe parties involved Steele’s and Deaton’s receiving money from Purser Sr., who was alleged to be\n\nsuffering from dementia, planning of further financial gain through a real-estate development scheme\n\nthat would net them $2.5 million each, and encouraging Purser Sr. to leave his money to\n\nthem—meanwhile persuading him that his family members were the ones scheming against him.\n\nThis evidence also supports the jury’s findings that Steele’s and Deaton’s conduct of defaming the\n\nPurser Family to Purser Sr. to secure further financial gain “offended a public sense of justice\n\nand propriety.”\n\n\n               C. Statutory cap\n\n               In addition to the Kraus factors, we must consider application of the statutory cap on\n\nsuch awards in addressing Scarbrough’s, Steele’s, and Deaton’s complaints about the excessiveness\n\nof the jury’s exemplary-damages award. Decisions about whether exemplary damages should be\n\nawarded and the amount of exemplary damages awarded are reserved to the discretion of the trier\n\nof fact, Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.010(b), but an exemplary damage award may not exceed\n\nthe cap set forth in section 41.008 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code, id. § 41.008(b).\n\nIn the absence of certain types of criminal conduct not implicated here, section 41.008 limits an\n\naward of exemplary damages to the greater of:\n\n\n       (1) (A) two times the amount of economic damages; plus\n\n           (B) an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n               exceed $750,000; or\n\n       (2) $200,000.\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fId. § 41.008(b).\n\n               After reviewing the entire record, analyzing the evidence under the Kraus factors,\n\nconsidering the amount of compensatory damages, and applying the statutory cap, we conclude\n\nthat exemplary damages are recoverable against Scarbrough, Steele, and Deaton. However,\n\nthe exemplary-damage awards against them are excessive in light of the statutory cap in\n\nsection 41.008(b).\n\n               As to Scarbrough, the jury awarded the Purser Family $8,000,000 in exemplary\n\ndamages. Applying section 41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $700,000 in noneconomic\n\ndamages for past mental anguish results in a maximum award of $700,000 in exemplary damages.\n\nSee id. (authorizing award for greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages\n\nfound by the jury, not to exceed $750,000”). Because the $8,000,000 exemplary damages award\n\nagainst Scarbrough exceeds the statutory cap by $7,300,000, we modify the exemplary damage\n\naward to $700,000 to comply with the cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n               As to Steele, the jury awarded exemplary damages of $3,500,000. Applying section\n\n41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $180,000 in noneconomic damages for past mental\n\nanguish results in a maximum award of $200,000 in exemplary damages. See id. (authorizing award\n\nfor greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n\nexceed $750,000”). Because the $3,500,000 exemplary damages award against Steele exceeds the\n\nstatutory cap by $3,300,000, we modify the exemplary damage award to $200,000 to comply with\n\nthe cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n               As to Deaton, the jury awarded exemplary damages of $2,000,000. Applying section\n\n41.008 to the jury’s unchallenged award of $180,000 in noneconomic damages for past mental\n\n\n                                               36\n\fanguish results in a maximum award of $200,000 in exemplary damages. See id. (authorizing award\n\nfor greater of $200,000 or “an amount equal to any noneconomic damages found by the jury, not to\n\nexceed $750,000”). Because the $2,000,000 exemplary damages award against Deaton exceeds the\n\nstatutory cap by $1,800,000, we modify the exemplary damage award to $200,000 to comply with\n\nthe cap, and affirm the award as modified.\n\n\n                      V. Spoliation and discovery-abuse sanctions issues\n\nA. Spoliation instruction as to Scarbrough\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the district court erred in giving a spoliation instruction\n\nagainst him regarding the digital recorder because there is no evidence that he failed to preserve the\n\ndigital recorder or had a duty to preserve it when he returned it to Deaton. When conducting a\n\nlegal-sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the challenged\n\nfinding and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it and disregard contrary evidence\n\nunless reasonable jurors could not. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 822, 827. To prevail, an appellant\n\nmust show that no more than a scintilla of evidence supports a finding on which the opponent had\n\nthe burden of proof. See Waste Mgmt. of Tex., 434 S.W.3d at 156-57; City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d\n\nat 826. More than a scintilla of evidence exists to support a finding when the evidence enables\n\nreasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions. Gharda USA, 464 S.W.3d at 347.\n\nWe may not substitute our judgment for that of the jury when the evidence falls within the zone of\n\nreasonable disagreement, and the jury is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the\n\nweight to be given to their testimony.

Spoliation of evidence requires two\n\naffirmative findings from the trial court: (1) that the nonproducing party had a duty to preserve the\n\nevidence, and (2) that the nonproducing party breached its duty to preserve material and relevant\n\nevidence. Aldridge, 438 S.W.3d at 20. A spoliation instruction is an appropriate remedy when a\n\nparty’s spoliation of evidence is intentional. Id. at 24. Intentional spoliation “includes the concept\n\nof ‘willful blindness,’ which encompasses the scenario in which a party does not directly destroy\n\nevidence known to be relevant and discoverable, but nonetheless allows for its destruction.” Id. at\n\n24-25 (citing Andrew Hebl, Spoliation of Electronically Stored Information, Good Faith, and\n\nRule 37(e), 29 N. Ill. U. L. Rev. 79, 97-98 (2008)).\n\n               Because Scarbrough does not contend that the spoliation instruction was legally\n\nincorrect, we analyze the sufficiency of the evidence based on the charge given. See Kia Motors\n\nCorp. v. Ruiz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875 (Tex. 2014). The charge stated:\n\n\n       You are instructed that Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and Jerry Scarbrough\n       intentionally did not preserve or failed to produce the digital recorder when they\n       knew or should have known that a claim had been filed and that the digital recorder\n       in their possession or control would be material and relevant to that claim.\n\n       Under such circumstances, the failure of Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and\n       Jerry Scarbrough to preserve or produce evidence within her or his control raises\n       the presumption that if such evidence were produced, it would operate against\n       Denise Steele, Melissa Deaton and Jerry Scarbrough.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fScarbrough does not dispute his knowledge that a claim had been filed by the Pursers and that\n\ndiscovery was ongoing. His contention is that he had no duty to preserve the recorder because the\n\nPursers did not show that he knew or should have known that the recorder would have been\n\n“material and relevant to that claim.”\n\n               Scarbrough acknowledged on the record at Deaton’s third deposition that he had a\n\nduty to determine what was on the recorder. He knew that appellees had requested production of\n\nwitness statements, and he stated that Deaton had produced the recorder to him shortly after her\n\nsecond deposition, representing to him that it contained a recording of a conversation that she and\n\nher sister Kathy Perdue had with Purser Sr., i.e., a recording with statements from two parties to the\n\nlawsuit (the “sister recording”). Deaton’s recollection differed. In her second deposition, Deaton\n\ntestified that she had given a tape recording to Scarbrough shortly before that deposition began18 and\n\nthat she could not remember what was on that recording: “I would have to relisten to it. I do not\n\nremember what all is on it.” Scarbrough produced that recording and acknowledged that he had a\n\nduty to find out what was on “the tape” (“I think I have an obligation to my client and to you to see\n\nwhether or not . . . there are recordings on there that are pertinent to this lawsuit that are not\n\nfrivolous”).19 Scarbrough further said it was “absolutely true” that if a lawyer is holding onto\n\nevidence, he is charged with knowledge of what is in that evidence.\n\n\n\n\n       18\n         Deaton changed her testimony in her third deposition, stating that she could not remember\nwhen she gave the recorder to Scarbrough.\n       19\n           Deaton also identified a separate recording of Purser Sr. that was made at her request by\nher first attorney, John Redington. The “Redington recording” was not made with the digital\nrecorder but on an analog (microcassette) recorder.\n\n                                                 39\n\f               But the record shows that Scarbrough failed to perform any inquiry into how many\n\nrecordings were on the device and “just assumed that there was one.” He testified that having the\n\nrecorder “sure would be helpful” and “it would be really great if we could find that recorder and see\n\nwhat, if anything, was on it.” He never asked Steele, the owner of the device, about the recorder or\n\nany recordings she had previously made with it: “I don’t know that Ms. Steele ever talked to me\n\nabout it.”20 He never asked his IT tech, Shawn Richeson, how many files or recordings were on the\n\ndevice. But Richeson’s January 11, 2011 billing states “7 individual audio files recovered from USB\n\ndigital recorder and returned recorder to Jerry.” Scarbrough testified that he paid Richeson.\n\n               Scarbrough did not ask Deaton to preserve the recorder when he returned it to her.\n\nAlthough the recorder was in good working condition, was not “cheap,” and belonged to Steele,\n\nDeaton testified that sometime between March and April 2011 the recorder “either went to Goodwill\n\nor it went in my trash.” Meanwhile, Scarbrough continued insisting that as far as he knew, he had\n\nproduced everything appellees requested. For over six weeks between the time that Deaton told him\n\nthat she had disposed of the recorder and the time of the first sanctions hearing, Scarbrough said\n\nnothing to opposing counsel about the lost recorder. When Scarbrough was asked what actions he\n\ntook to preserve it, he testified that he asked Richeson to make a CD of it and that he wrote a letter\n\nto Deaton in July 2011 (after she had already disposed of it) asking her to preserve the recorder.\n\n\n               1. The recorder was material\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the recorder was duplicative of information already\n\nprovided to appellees from Richeson’s server and was not material. “Material evidence” has been\n\n\n       20\n          This is consistent with Steele’s testimony that she did not converse with Scarbrough about\nthe recorder.\n\n                                                 40\n\fdefined as “[e]vidence having some logical connection with the facts of the case or the legal issues\n\npresented.” Material Evidence, Black’s Law Dictionary 676 (10th ed. 2014). Contrary to\n\nScarbrough’s view, the recorder was material evidence and was not merely duplicative. No witness\n\nwho had possession or control of the digital recorder confirmed that the recordings on Richeson’s\n\nserver duplicated everything that had been on the recorder. In fact, there was evidence suggesting\n\nfiles were deleted from the recorder. Steele testified that she had taped “several” real estate classes\n\nshe was attending “on that particular recorder” and none of those recordings were included in what\n\nRicheson recovered from it. Another recording that was not among the files that Richeson recovered\n\nwas one that Deaton testified she had made of Purser Sr. making a settlement offer to her to drop her\n\ncounterclaims. Richeson testified that files could be deleted from the recorder, that it is possible to\n\nrecover deleted files from the recorder, that he did not attempt to recover any deleted files because\n\nhe was not asked to check for files that were deleted, and that determining what had been on the\n\ndigital recorder required the recorder itself. Testimony about another claimed discrepancy came\n\nfrom Scarbrough, who stated that the CD that Richeson provided to him differed from the CD with\n\nthe recordings provided to the appellees. Only with the recorder, Richeson said, could he confirm\n\nwhether Scarbrough’s CD contained all of the recordings that were recovered from the device.\n\nBased on this evidence, the trial court would not have abused its discretion in finding that the\n\nrecorder was evidence that had a logical connection with the facts of or legal issues presented in the\n\nPurser Family’s suit and Scarbrough knew or should have known the recorder was material.\n\n\n               2. The recorder was relevant\n\n               Scarbrough next contends that the recorder was not relevant. “Relevant evidence”\n\nis evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\n\n                                                  41\n\fdetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 401. If there is a logical connection either directly or by inference between the\n\nevidence and a fact to be proved, the evidence is relevant. Clark v. Randalls Food, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279882\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279882/clark-v-randalls-food/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n357 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). The Purser Family’s suit alleged in part\n\nthat Scarbrough’s clients Deaton and Steele initiated an inappropriate relationship with Purser Sr.\n\nand financially exploited him while he suffered from dementia. Portions of the recordings that\n\nRicheson obtained from the recorder depicted conversations between Deaton, Steele, and Purser Sr.\n\nsupporting the Purser Family’s allegations.\n\n               Based on the witness statements that were recovered from the recorder, all of the\n\nevidence presented during the three-day hearing, and reasonable inferences drawn from that\n\nevidence, the district court would not have abused its discretion in determining that evidence not\n\nrecovered from the recorder before Deaton disposed of it was at least potentially relevant to the\n\nPurser Family’s claims and that Scarbrough knew or should have known that the recorder was\n\nrelevant.   See IQ Holdings, Inc. v. Stewart Title Guar. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (concluding that appellee’s attorney had duty to preserve\n\ndocuments that were at least potentially relevant to appellant’s claims against appellees); Clark,\n\n317 S.W.3d at 357.\n\n               The evidence in this record, considered in the light most favorable to the trial court’s\n\nruling, contains more than a scintilla of evidence showing that Scarbrough knew or should have\n\nknown that he had a duty to preserve the digital recorder, which was material and relevant to the\n\nlawsuit, and that he failed to do so. The evidence further shows that the district court’s spoliation\n\ninstruction was based on more than a scintilla of evidence that Scarbrough failed to preserve the\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fdigital recorder and had a duty to preserve it when he returned it to Deaton. There is proof of\n\nScarbrough’s willful blindness as to the recorder, i.e., that he did not directly destroy evidence\n\nknown to be relevant and discoverable, but nonetheless allowed for its destruction. See Aldridge,\n\n438 S.W.3d at 24-25. Scarbrough avoided knowledge of what was on the digital recorder by failing\n\nto perform any inquiry into its contents, not even asking Steele, the owner of the recorder, or\n\nRicheson, who recovered the information for Scarbrough from the recorder, what recordings had\n\nbeen on it or recovered from it. Scarbrough knew from Deaton’s deposition that the recorder\n\ncontained statements from parties to the lawsuit (herself and Purser Sr.), and that she did not\n\nremember “what all was on it.” Despite that testimony, Scarbrough “just assumed that there was\n\none,” choosing not to confirm whether other recorded statements might be on the device. Then\n\nwhile discovery was ongoing, Scarbrough returned the recorder not to its owner but to Deaton,\n\nsaying nothing to her about preserving it until his letter months later, ultimately allowing for her\n\ndisposal of it. Because this record disproves it, we overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that “no\n\nevidence” supported the spoliation instruction.\n\n\nB. Sufficient evidence of recordings that were not produced\n\n               Scarbrough contends that there is no evidence that he destroyed evidence or that the\n\nPurser Family was deprived of evidence he was accused of spoliating. However, as previously\n\ndiscussed, there was evidence indicating that files were deleted from the recorder: Steele testified\n\nthat real-estate classes she recorded were not among the files that Richeson recovered, and Deaton\n\ntestified that her recording of a settlement offer that Purser Sr. made to her was not recovered either.\n\nAs Richeson made clear, there is no way to determine what had been on the recorder, i.e., what\n\nevidence the Purser Family was deprived of, without the device itself. We overrule Scarbrough’s\n\n                                                  43\n\fcomplaint that there is no evidence that he destroyed evidence or that the Purser Family was deprived\n\nof evidence he was accused of spoliating.\n\n\nC. Discovery-abuse sanctions against Scarbrough\n\n               In five separate orders, the district court awarded Helen monetary sanctions totaling\n\n$54,261.50 for Scarbrough’s discovery abuse, pursuant to the court’s inherent authority and Texas\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 215. Scarbrough’s final set of issues challenges the imposition of sanctions\n\nagainst him in three of those orders, which imposed sanctions of $25,000, $15,959.50, and $11,000.21\n\nScarbrough contends: (1) sanctions imposed for failure to produce all the requested recordings were\n\nnot “just”; (2) sanctions imposed for disclosure of Purser’s medical records were not “just” and his\n\ndisclosure to Bolling was minimal and inconsequential; and (3) the Purser Family lacked standing\n\nto request sanctions for disclosure of Purser Sr.’s medical records.\n\n               A trial court may impose sanctions on any party that abuses the discovery process in\n\nseeking, making, or resisting discovery.        See Tex. R. Civ. P. 215.3; Wein v. Sherman,\n\nNo. 03-10-00499-CV, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 10666, at *39 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 23, 2013, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.)

Sanctions for failure to produce requested recordings were “just”\n\n                Scarbrough contends that the $25,000 sanctions award was not “just” because he did\n\nnot know that the recorder was relevant and material, requiring preservation. However, as we have\n\ndiscussed, the recorder was material evidence and was not merely duplicative—no witness who had\n\npossession or control of the digital recorder confirmed that the recordings on Richeson’s server\n\nduplicated everything that had been on the recorder, and there was evidence indicating that files were\n\ndeleted from the recorder. We have also discussed that the evidence not recovered from the recorder\n\nbefore Deaton disposed of it was at least potentially relevant to the Purser Family’s claims, as\n\nindicated by the recordings that were recovered, and that Scarbrough knew or should have known\n\nthat the recorder was relevant. See IQ Holdings, Inc., 451 S.W.3d at 868; Clark, 317 S.W.3d at 357.\n\n                Scarbrough attempts to shift the blame to others for failure to produce recordings\n\nduring discovery. However, the court’s order specified that Scarbrough was also being sanctioned\n\n\n\n                                                   45\n\ffor “his intentional concealment and deception regarding the existence of audio recordings,” conduct\n\nthat did not implicate anyone else. Actions that callously disregard the rules of discovery warrant\n\na presumption that the actor’s claims are meritless because the very purpose of discovery is “to seek\n\nthe truth, so that disputes may be decided by what the facts reveal, not by what facts are concealed.”\n\nKhan v.

The court’s award of $25,000 was far\n\nless than the total amount of those fees. Scarbrough failed to demonstrate that the court acted\n\nwithout reference to guiding rules and principles in issuing these sanctions. See American Flood\n\nResearch, 192 S.W.3d at 583. We overrule Scarbrough’s complaint that the $25,000 sanctions\n\n\n                                                   46\n\faward was not “just” because he did not know that the recorder was relevant and material,\n\nrequiring preservation.\n\n\n               2.

During the sanctions hearings, Scarbrough admitted he was\n\nbound by the court order, but he claimed he had to divulge the medical records to a law-enforcement\n\nexpert to obtain the autopsy he wanted performed on Purser Sr. However, Scarbrough testified that\n\nthe medical records “were of limited value.” Scarbrough minimizes his disclosure to Bolling as a\n\n“slip of the tongue.” The trial court was not persuaded that Scarbrough’s disclosure was inadvertent.\n\nAfter listening to Scarbrough’s entire recorded conversation with Bolling, the court stated that\n\nScarbrough had quoted from the medical records in an apparent attempt to prejudice a witness.\n\nSignificantly, both of these medical-record disclosures were made along with Scarbrough’s false and\n\ndefamatory statements about the Purser Family in an alleged attempt to prove that Purser Sr. did not\n\nhave dementia.

Appellants waived misjoinder complaint\n\n                Appellants contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the Purser Family’s\n\nthird-party claims against them because they were not liable for all or part of Olvera’s claims against\n\nPurser Sr. in the original lawsuit. However, the Purser Family correctly notes that misjoinder of\n\nactions is a procedural, not jurisdictional matter. See Allison v. Arkansas La.

App.—Austin 1991, no writ) (concluding that misjoinder complaint\n\nraised for first time on appeal was waived). Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 41, misjoinder of\n\nparties may be addressed on a party’s motion or on the court’s own initiative before submission of\n\nthe case, allowing improperly joined actions to be severed and each ground of recovery improperly\n\njoined to be docketed as a separate suit between the same parties. Tex. R. Civ. P. 41. Steele and\n\nDeaton raise the issue of misjoinder for the first time on appeal and have waived it. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a); Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 200.23\n\n               Unlike Steele and Deaton, Scarbrough filed a motion for severance. But it did not\n\nraise his appellate complaint—that the Purser Family’s third-party claims against him were\n\nimproperly joined because he was not liable for all or part of Olvera’s claims against\n\nPurser Sr.—rather, the motion contended only that severance was proper because he had inadequate\n\ntime to prepare his defense. With this motion, Scarbrough preserved nothing about his misjoinder\n\ncomplaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Hinton, 822 S.W.2d at 200. Scarbrough’s misjoinder\n\ncomplaint is waived.24\n\n\n       23\n           We note that the case appellants cite in support of their contention that misjoinder is a\njurisdictional issue was decided before the promulgation of Rule 41.\n       24\n           Even if he had preserved this issue, we review a trial court’s severance ruling for an abuse\nof discretion, see Liberty Nat’l Fire Ins.

Akin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1687171\"><a href=\"/opinion/1687171/liberty-nat-fire-ins-co-v-akin/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 629 (Tex. 1996), which is not\nshown on this record. Scarbrough’s motion for severance was denied on the same day that the\ndistrict court signed Olvera’s nonsuit and dismissal with prejudice of his claims against Purser Sr.,\nleaving only the Purser Family’s third-party claims against appellants in the suit. Thus, there was\nnothing for the district court to sever.\n\n                                                  49\n\fB. Scarbrough waived Rule 13 sanctions complaint\n\n               Scarbrough contends that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion\n\nfor Rule 13 sanctions, but the record shows that Scarbrough withdrew that motion:\n\n\n       THE COURT:            Okay, the next matter has to do with Mr. Scarbrough’s Motion\n                             for Sanctions for allegedly filing frivolous pleadings under\n                             Rule 13. I’ve read the motion. I’ve read the response.\n                             Mr. Scarbrough, did you wish to make argument?\n\n       SCARBROUGH:           Your Honor, I’m going to withdraw that motion.\n\n       THE COURT:            The motion is withdrawn. The Court grants you[] permission\n                             to withdraw the motion.\n\n\nScarbrough waived his Rule 13 sanctions complaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n\nC. Scarbrough waived issue that discovery sanctions restricted his access to the courts\n\n               Scarbrough contends for the first time on appeal that the sanctions imposed against\n\nhim for discovery abuse were excessive and unconstitutional because they restricted his access to the\n\ncourts. He contends, citing no authority, that the post-judgment filing of his affidavit of net worth,\n\nwhile “not a formal notice that the sanctions assessed precluded access to the courts, [] should be\n\nconsidered such a request.” Scarbrough waived his complaint that the discovery sanctions restricted\n\nhis access to the courts. See id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 50\n\fD. Steele and Deaton waived spoliation-instruction issue\n\n               Steele and Deaton contend that the district court erred in giving a spoliation\n\ninstruction because there is no evidence that Steele had custody of the digital recorder or failed to\n\npreserve it, and because there is no evidence that Deaton had a duty to preserve the recorder when\n\nshe disposed of it. However, they did not raise the arguments they are making here in their motion\n\nfor judgment notwithstanding the verdict and failed to otherwise preserve them for appellate review.\n\nSee id.; B & W Supply, Inc. v.
