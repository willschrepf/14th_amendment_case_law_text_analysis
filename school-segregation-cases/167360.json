Coutin  appeals.   Because  the  district  court\r\n\nemployed   a  flawed  methodology  and  relied  on  impermissible\r\n\ncriteria, we vacate its order and remand for further proceedings.\r\n\nI.  BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On December  30, 1993,  the appellant  sued her  former\r\n\nemployer, defendant-appellee Young &amp; Rubicam of Puerto Rico, Inc.\r\n\n(Y&amp;R), an advertising agency, for over $1,500,000 in compensatory\r\n\nand punitive  damages.   Her complaint  advanced one  substantive\r\n\nfederal  claim:   that Y&amp;R had  violated Title  VII of  the Civil\r\n\nRights  Act of  1964,  42  U.S.C.     2000e  to 2000e-17  (1994),\r\n\nincluding  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.   2000e(k)\r\n\n(1994), by (1) assigning Coutin  (who was then pregnant) to tasks\r\n\nthat were  detrimental to her physical and  emotional health, (2)\r\n\nrequiring her to work under unsafe conditions, (3) condoning (or,\r\n\nat least, neglecting to curb) her coworkers' disparaging comments\r\n\nabout her gravidity, and (4) constructively discharging her.  The\r\n\ncomplaint  also  included  several claims  under  local  law, the\r\n\nelements of  which were  subsumed, without  exception, under  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Coutin's  spouse  and their  conjugal partnership  are also\r\nplaintiffs  and appellants  in this  litigation.   Because  their\r\nrights derive from Coutin's, we  opt for simplicity and treat the\r\nappeal as if Coutin were the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nbroader federal claim.\r\n\n          Y&amp;R denied  Coutin's allegations and defended  the suit\r\n\nwith considerable vigor.  Along the way, the parties attempted to\r\n\nreach  an  accord, but  they  came  no closer  than  a demand  of\r\n\n$150,000 as against an offer of $15,000.  At trial, the appellant\r\n\n(who  had secured  and  retained  other  employment)  offered  no\r\n\nevidence of  lost income, and  that aspect of her  original claim\r\n\nwas  pretermitted.  The  case went to the  jury, which found that\r\n\nY&amp;R had intentionally  discriminated against, and  constructively\r\n\ndischarged, the appellant, thus violating both federal and Puerto\r\n\nRico law.   The jury awarded the appellant and her spouse a total\r\n\nof $44,000 in  compensatory damages, plus an additional $1,538 in\r\n\nseverance  pay under  Law  80, P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  29,    185a\r\n\n(1985).   The jury rejected  the appellant's prayer  for punitive\r\n\ndamages.\r\n\n          Y&amp;R, which had  moved unsuccessfully for judgment  as a\r\n\nmatter of law on several occasions during the trial, renewed that\r\n\nmotion and asked alternatively for a new trial.  See Fed. R. Civ.\r                                                              \r\n\nP. 50,  59.   The district court  refused relief.   In  turn, the\r\n\nappellant  petitioned under  42 U.S.C.     1988 for  an award  of\r\n\n$52,793.75  in  counsel fees  and  related  expenses.    The  fee\r\n\napplication contained  a sworn statement delineating her lawyer's\r\n\ntwo   decades  of  experience  in  personal  injury,  labor,  and\r\n\ndiscrimination  cases,  as  well  as  extensive,  contemporaneous\r\n\nbilling  records  that  detailed  the  lawyer's  work  over  four\r\n\ncalendar years.  At the bottom line, the reckoning reflected out-\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nof-court time (250.25 hours) billed at $175 per hour and in-court\r\n\ntime (45 hours) billed at $200 per hour.\r\n\n          Despite this meticulous proffer, the judge eschewed any\r\n\ndiscussion  of  either  the  hours  spent  or the  billing  rates\r\n\nassigned and instead awarded the appellant a mere $5,000 in fees.\r\n\nThe  judge  purported  to  base  his  decision  entirely  on  the\r\n\n\"plaintiffs' limited  success on  their  claims, the  plaintiffs'\r\n\nwillingness  to go  to  trial  despite  the  defendant's  earnest\r\n\nefforts to settle the case for a reasonable sum, and the equities\r\n\ninvolved.\"2  This appeal ensued.\r\n\nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r          II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\n          We   review   fee   awards   deferentially,   according\r\n\nsubstantial  respect to  the  trial court's  informed discretion.\r\n\nSee Brewster  v. Dukakis, 3  F.3d 488, 492  (1st Cir. 1993).   We\r                                  \r\n\nwill disturb such  an award only for  mistake of law or  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion.   See United States v. Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  12, 14  (1st  Cir. 1988).    In this  regard,  an abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion occurs \"when  a material factor deserving  significant\r\n\nweight is  ignored, when  an improper factor  is relied  upon, or\r\n\nwhen all  proper and  no improper factors  are assessed,  but the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2While the court did not elaborate upon the phrase \"equities\r\ninvolved,\" it is apparently a euphemism for the judge's view that\r\nthe appellant  had been fortunate to secure a verdict, and that a\r\nlarge  fee  award  therefore  \"would  constitute  an  intolerable\r\nwindfall.\"   We proceed on the  assumption that this is  what the\r\njudge meant.    In all  events,  if the  judge was  referring  to\r\n\"equities\" in a broader sense, those equities, to the extent that\r\nthey  bear on attorney  compensation, are encompassed  within the\r\nstandard   fee-adjustment  factors.     See  infra  note   3  and\r                                                            \r\naccompanying text.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ncourt makes a serious mistake in weighing them.\"  Foster v. Mydas\r                                                                           \r\n\nAssocs., Inc.,  943  F.2d  139,  143 (1st  Cir.  1991)  (internal\r                       \r\n\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\r\n\n          Although  our  analytical  posture  is  respectful,  we\r\n\nnonetheless must engage the district court's decision critically.\r\n\nTo facilitate this perlustration,  we require the lower  court to\r\n\nexplain its  actions.  See id. at 141.   The explanation need not\r                                        \r\n\nbe  painstaking,   and,  sometimes,   it  may   even  appear   by\r\n\nimplication, but at a bare minimum, the order awarding fees, read\r\n\nagainst the  backdrop of the record  as a whole, must  expose the\r\n\ndistrict  court's thought process and show  the method and manner\r\n\nunderlying its  decisional calculus.   See  Blum v. Stenson,  465\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. 886,  898 (1984);  Hensley v. Eckerhart,  461 U.S.  424, 437\r                                                      \r\n\n(1983).\r\n\n          This  principle is  especially important  when  the fee\r\n\naward  departs  substantially  from the  contours  shaped  by the\r\n\napplication.  \"As a general rule, a fee-awarding court that makes\r\n\na   substantial   reduction   in   either  documented   time   or\r\n\nauthenticated  rates should  offer reasonably  explicit findings,\r\n\nfor  the court, in such circumstances, `has a burden to spell out\r\n\nthe  whys and  wherefores.'\"   Brewster, 3  F.3d at  493 (quoting\r                                                 \r\n\nMetropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d  at 18)).  An appellate court\r                                   \r\n\ndeprived  of meaningful insight  into the trial  court's thinking\r\n\nfrequently  will be  unable to  conduct an  adequate review  of a\r\n\nsignificantly adjusted fee  award, and thus will be  compelled to\r\n\nremand  for  further findings.    See,  e.g.,  Riley v.  City  of\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nJackson, 99  F.3d 757, 760  (5th Cir. 1996); Freeman  v. Franzen,\r                                                                          \r\n\n695 F.2d 485, 494 (7th Cir. 1982).\r\n\nIII.  METHODOLOGY\r          III.  METHODOLOGY\r\n\n           The lodestar method  is the strongly preferred  method\r\n\nby which  district courts  should determine  what  fees to  award\r\n\nprevailing  parties  in actions  that  fall within  the  ambit of\r\n\nsection 1988.  See Lipsett v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1992).  This approach contemplates judicial ascertainment of \"the\r\n\nnumber  of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied\r\n\nby  a   reasonable  hourly  rate\"   as  the  starting   point  in\r\n\nconstructing a fee award.  Hensley,  461 U.S. at 433.  While  the\r                                            \r\n\nlodestar method  is a  tool,  not a  straitjacket    as  we  have\r\n\nacknowledged,  some deviation from an orthodox application of the\r\n\nmethod   is  permissible   in  highly  unusual   situations,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nMetropolitan Dist. Comm'n,  847 F.2d  at 15-16    a  fee-awarding\r                                   \r\n\ncourt shuns this tried-and-true approach at its peril.  See Segal\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Gilbert Color Sys., Inc., 746 F.2d 78, 87 (1st Cir. 1984).  As\r                                     \r\n\nwe have said, the lodestar method is a tool, but it is not merely\r\n\na tool.   The method is also a device which enables courts to pay\r\n\nhomage to  the fundamental reason  that Congress passed  the Fees\r\n\nAct:    its  resolve  that  certain  types  of  wrongs,  such  as\r\n\ndiscrimination on account of sex, should not be countenanced, and\r\n\nthat  private suits  aimed  at redeeming  such  abuses should  be\r\n\nencouraged.  See City of Riverside  v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 574-\r                                                       \r\n\n75 (1986) (plurality opinion).\r\n\n          To  say  that  a  trial court  mulling  a  fee  request\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nordinarily must fashion a lodestar  is not to say that  the court\r\n\nis  in thrall  to  an attorney's  time records.    The court  can\r\n\nsegregate time spent  on certain unsuccessful claims,  see, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nHensley, 461  U.S. at  435, eliminate  excessive or  unproductive\r                 \r\n\nhours,  see, e.g.,  Lipsett, 975  F.2d  at 937,  and assign  more\r                                     \r\n\nrealistic rates  to time  spent, see, e.g.,  Brewster, 3  F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n492.   In these and other ways,  the trial court, though adhering\r\n\nto the time-and-rate-based method of fee calculation, may fashion\r\n\na lodestar which differs substantially from the fee requested  by\r\n\nthe  prevailing party.   Moreover,  the trial  court retains  the\r\n\nauthority  to adjust the lodestar after  initially computing it  \r\n\nbut it  must do so in  accordance with accepted  principles.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nHensley,  461 U.S. at  429-31 (citing the  legislative history of\r                 \r\n\nthe Fees Act and observing that it is appropriate to  adjust fees\r\n\nin accordance  with the  twelve factors set  forth in  Johnson v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nGeorgia Highway  Express, Inc.,  488 F.2d 714,  717-19 (5th  Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n1974)).3\r\n\nIV.

These\r                                                 \r\nfactors are:   (1) the time and  labor required; (2) the  novelty\r\nand difficulty  of  the questions;  (3)  the skill  requisite  to\r\nperform the legal services properly; (4) the preclusion of  other\r\nemployment by the attorney(s) due  to acceptance of the case; (5)\r\nthe  customary  fee;  (6)  the   nature  of  the  fee  (fixed  or\r\ncontingent); (7) the  time limitations imposed  by the client  or\r\nthe  circumstances; (8)  the  amount  involved  and  the  results\r\nobtained;  (9) the  experience, reputation,  and  ability of  the\r\nattorney(s);  (10) the  \"undesirability\" of  the  case; (11)  the\r\nnature  and  length  of the  professional  relationship  with the\r\nclient; and (12) the size of awards in similar cases.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nneeded to  permit the district  court to follow  the conventional\r\n\napproach,  but the court scarcely mentioned  that proffer and, in\r\n\nall events,  did not  engage in  any lodestar analysis  whatever.\r\n\nWhile  such  a   departure  from  preferred  practice   will  not\r\n\nnecessarily  be fatal, spurning  all consideration of  a lodestar\r\n\nplaces a substantial  burden upon the  district court to  account\r\n\nfor its  actions.  See Berg v. Gackenbach,  966 F.2d 731, 732 (2d\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1992); Metropolitan Dist. Comm'n, 847 F.2d at 12, 15.\r                                               \r\n\n          Here, the district  court did not  cite any reason  for\r\n\nabjuring  the lodestar  method.   Still,  the court  did make  an\r\n\neffort  to explain its decisionmaking process, indicating that it\r\n\nhad  premised its  decision on  three factors:    the appellant's\r\n\nlimited  success, the  parties' abortive  efforts  to settle  the\r\n\ncase,  and  the equities  of  the  situation.   But  the  court's\r\n\nreliance on the first of  these factors is at best insufficiently\r\n\nexplained, and its  reliance on the other two  factors is plainly\r\n\nwrong.   Moreover, none  of these  factors justifies  the court's\r\n\nfailure to compute (and then adjust, if necessary) a lodestar.\r\n\n                       A.  Limited Success.\r                                 A.  Limited Success.\r                                                    \r\n\n          The district  court's  conclusion  that  the  appellant\r\n\nenjoyed  only \"limited success\" (and,  thus, deserved less in the\r\n\nway of counsel  fees) is too much of  a stretch.  To  be sure, as\r\n\nthe  court pointed  out, there  was  a chasmal  gulf between  the\r\n\ndamages requested in the complaint and the damages awarded.4  The\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4In  making this  comparison, the  court  emphasized the  ad\r\ndamnum.   The use of  the ad damnum  for this purpose  is suspect\r\nbecause the ad damnum is an inherently artificial construct.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncourt had a right to keep this discrepancy in mind, but it cannot\r\n\namount to more  than one element in the  constellation of factors\r\n\nthat  the court  considers when  determining the  quality  of the\r\n\nresults  obtained.     Because  this   phenomenon  is   sometimes\r\n\nmisunderstood, we take some pains to explain it.\r\n\n          As Judge  Casellas correctly noted,  the Supreme  Court\r\n\nhas  identified results obtained as a preeminent consideration in\r\n\nthe fee-adjustment process.   See Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 432, 440.\r                                                   \r\n\nBut  the term \"results obtained\"  has a variety  of meanings.  It\r\n\ncan refer  to a  plaintiff's success  claim by  claim, or  to the\r\n\nrelief actually  achieved, or to  the societal importance  of the\r\n\nright which has been vindicated,  or to all of these  measures in\r\n\ncombination.  We think that the  last meaning is the best choice,\r\n\nand  that,  as  a  consequence,  all  three  types  of  \"results\"\r\n\npotentially bear upon  the amount of an  ensuing fee award.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\ngenerally Norman v.  Housing Auth. of Montgomery, 836  F.2d 1292,\r                                                          \r\n\n1302 (11th Cir. 1988).\r\n\n          Although all three measures of success must be factored\r\n\ninto the fee-reduction  calculus, they do not  lend themselves to\r\n\nidentical treatment.   On the  one hand, to  the extent that  fee\r\n\nadjustments are  intended to  reflect the  success or failure  of\r\n\nseverable  claims, they are relatively easy to calculate because,\r\n\nalthough some overlap  may muddy the waters, a  court usually can\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nAggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of Med., 745 F.2d 723, 729 (1st Cir. 1984)\r                                        \r\n(observing that  \"[m]odern litigation  practices being what  they\r\nare, the  monetary demand which  caps a plaintiff's  complaint is\r\nlikely to be sanguine at best\").\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ndetermine the  extent to which  a plaintiff has prevailed  on her\r\n\nclaims merely  by perusing the  docket (e.g., the  complaint, the\r\n\nverdict  form, etc.),  and  can  then filter  out  time spent  on\r\n\nunsuccessful claims.  See, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940-41.  On\r                                                  \r\n\nthe other hand,  a fee reduction in  response to a scanty  damage\r\n\naward  or  a  shortfall  in  other relief  entails  a  subjective\r\n\nevaluation  of damages  awarded and nonmonetary  relief obtained,\r\n\nand is substantially  more difficult to quantify.5   Seen in this\r\n\nlight, the  computational principles  applicable to  claims-based\r\n\nfee reductions are relatively simple and straightforward, whereas\r\n\nthe  computational  principles  applicable  to  relief-based  fee\r\n\nreductions are highly  ramified and, in some respects, operate at\r\n\ncross  purposes.    To visualize  how  these  sometimes competing\r\n\nprinciples may  affect a district  court's effort to  determine a\r\n\n\"reasonable\"  fee,  it  may be  helpful  to  catalog the  several\r\n\npossible configurations in which the issue may arise.\r\n\n          1.   If a plaintiff  prevails on only some  of multiple\r                    1.\r\n\nclaims,  then  a  fee reduction  may  be  in  order.    To  guide\r\n\ndecisionmaking in this situation, the Justices have suggested two\r\n\nrelevant questions:  \"First, did the plaintiff fail to prevail on\r\n\nclaims that were  unrelated to the claims on  which he succeeded?\r\n\nSecond, did the  plaintiff achieve a level of  success that makes\r\n\nthe hours reasonably expended  a satisfactory basis for making  a\r\n\nfee award?\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434.\r                              \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5This  is equally true of  the vindication of rights (which,\r\nto the  extent it  may be relevant  here, plainly cuts  against a\r\nreduction in fees).\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          When different claims for relief are not interconnected\r\n\n  that  is, when  the claims  rest on  different facts  and legal\r\n\ntheories    they  are  by  definition  severable  and  unrelated.\r\n\nAttorneys' fees normally should not  be awarded for time spent in\r\n\nlitigating  (or preparing  to  litigate) unsuccessful,  severable\r\n\nclaims.  See id. at 435; Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940.\r                                          \r\n\n          2.   If a plaintiff prevails on an insubstantial subset\r                    2.\r\n\nof her interrelated  claims and obtains only  limited relief, the\r\n\ntrial  court  has  discretion  to  shrink  fees  to  reflect that\r\n\ninferior  result.   See  Hensley,  461 U.S.  at  436; Andrade  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nJamestown Hous.  Auth.,  82  F.3d  1179, 1191  (1st  Cir.  1996).\r                                \r\n\nWithal, a plaintiff who has limited success from a claim-by-claim\r\n\nstandpoint, but who nevertheless obtains substantial compensation\r\n\nor other important  relief, usually will fare much  better in the\r\n\nfee  wars, even  though some  of her  claims failed.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nHensley, 461  U.S. at 440  (\"Where a lawsuit consists  of related\r                 \r\n\nclaims, a  plaintiff who  has won  substantial relief  should not\r\n\nhave his attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court\r\n\ndid not adopt each contention raised.\").\r\n\n          3.   If  a prevailing  party is  successful on  all (or\r                    3.\r\n\nsubstantially all) of her claims, and receives complete (or near-\r\n\ncomplete) relief,  it goes  without saying  that reasonable  fees\r\n\nshould be  paid for time productively spent, without any discount\r\n\nfor limited success.\r\n\n          4.     If  a  prevailing  party  succeeds  on  all  (or\r                    4.\r\n\nsubstantially all)  of her  claims, but  receives no  significant\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nrelief (e.g.,  the jury awards  only nominal damages),  the trial\r\n\njudge  sometimes may deny  fees altogether because  this scenario\r\n\noften  \"highlights  the  plaintiff's  failure  to  prove  actual,\r\n\ncompensable injury.\"   Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S.  103, 115 (1992)\r                                                \r\n\n(denying fees in a case in which the plaintiff sought $17,000,000\r\n\nin damages and received $1); see also id. at 114 (affirming  that\r                                                   \r\n\n\"the `technical' nature  of a nominal damages award  or any other\r\n\njudgment . . . does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under  \r\n\n1988\").  Farrar,  then, signifies that fees need  not be bestowed\r                         \r\n\nif the  plaintiff's apparent victory  is \"purely technical  or de\r                                                                           \r\n\nminimis.\"  Id. at 117 (O'Connor, J., concurring).6\r                        \r\n\n          5.  Sometimes,  the plaintiff will  prevail on all  her\r                    5.\r\n\nclaims,  but  will  receive  limited  (though  not insubstantial)\r\n\nredress.   In such circumstances,  it is appropriate for  a trial\r\n\ncourt to consider the skimpiness of the relief when adjusting the\r\n\nlodestar figure.   See  Rivera, 477 U.S.  at 574.   But  though a\r                                        \r\n\nmeager damage  award may be  taken into consideration,  the Court\r\n\nhas squarely disclaimed \"the proposition that fee awards under   \r\n\n1988 should necessarily be proportionate to the amount of damages\r\n\na  civil  rights  plaintiff  actually  recovers.\"  Id. (approving\r                                                                \r\n\n$245,456.25 in fees  in a section 1983 action that  resulted in a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Be that as it may,  obtaining only nominal damages does not\r\nnegate  the possibility  of a  fee award.    For example,  if the\r\nplaintiff  receives another form  of meaningful relief,  then the\r\n\"results  obtained\"  may  be   substantial,  notwithstanding  the\r\nplaintiff's   failure  to  collect  compensatory  damages.

City of Lowell, 948\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 10, 19 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that although a trial  court\r\n\nis \"entitled to take into account the relative size of the damage\r\n\naward  and the  fee award,\"  the  former \"does  not constitute  a\r\n\ndispositive criterion, or even a ceiling\" on the latter).\r\n\n          It is readily apparent that some tension exists between\r\n\nthese principles:   while a judge may not  automatically reduce a\r\n\nfee award in proportion to  a judgment that is significantly less\r\n\nthan the plaintiff sought, the judge can take that small judgment\r\n\ninto   reasonable  account  in  massaging  the  lodestar.    This\r\n\ndissonance makes it  all the more crucial that a nisi prius court\r\n\nprovide a  clear explanation  when limited  relief furnishes  the\r\n\nostensible justification for a departure from the lodestar.\r\n\n          Conscious of these differing configurations, we turn to\r\n\nthe case  at hand.  The focus of our inquiry is the lower court's\r\n\ndetermination  that the  appellant's  success was  limited  (and,\r\n\nthus, justified a fee reduction).\r\n\n          We  start by  scrutinizing claims-based  success.   Y&amp;R\r\n\nasserts that Coutin's victory was less than complete both because\r\n\nthe  jury  declined to  grant  punitive damages  and  because the\r\n\nappellant did not pursue her original prayer for lost income.  We\r\n\nbelieve  that this riposte  blurs the distinction  between claims\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nand  damages.   In  the  fee-shifting context,  a  \"claim\" is  an\r\n\nallegation of  a legal injury  comprised of various  elements and\r\n\nequivalent to  a  cause  of action,  whereas  \"damages\"  are  the\r\n\ncompensation  awarded to the  plaintiff who has  suffered a legal\r\n\nwrong and who therefore has  a valid claim against the defendant.\r\n\nIn this case, punitive damages and loss of income (no matter  how\r\n\nthey are denominated in the complaint) are not failed claims, but\r\n\nare  categories  of relief  that  the  jury and  the  appellant's\r\n\nsubsequent employment history, respectively, have denied her.\r\n\n          We  need not linger.  From a claim-by-claim standpoint,\r\n\nthe  appellant prevailed up and down  the line.  She triumphed on\r\n\nevery  substantive claim asserted  under both federal  and Puerto\r\n\nRico law.   In so doing, she  achieved a 100% success  rate   and\r\n\ncomplete  success is hardly  \"limited.\"  Consequently,  a claims-\r\n\nbased, results-obtained fee reduction is wholly inappropriate.\r\n\n          From the  standpoint of relief obtained,  the situation\r\n\nis more  ambiguous.   After all, it  remains within  the district\r\n\ncourt's discretion to  reduce a fee award in  response to limited\r\n\nrelief even  in the  presence of  complete claims-based  success.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Cartwright v. Stamper,  7 F.3d 106, 109-10  (7th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1993)  (declining to award fees  where plaintiff succeeded on all\r\n\nclaims, but  received  only nominal  damages  for each).    Here,\r\n\nhowever, the damage award is substantial in absolute terms   over\r\n\n$45,000   and equals  roughly three times the  appellant's annual\r\n\nsalary.  On its face, such relief does not seem \"limited\"  in any\r\n\nrelevant sense.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\n          Moreover, to the extent   if at all   that the ratio of\r\n\nthe damages requested to the  judgment received may be taken into\r\n\naccount in  fixing an appropriate  award, see Foley, 948  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n19-20 (\"Often,  when the  amount sought is  large but  the actual\r\n\nrecovery is  small, fees  may be  reduced  somewhat.\"); see  also\r                                                                           \r\n\nLoggins  v.  Delo,  999  F.2d  364, 369  (8th  Cir.  1993),  this\r                           \r\n\nproportion may be  used only  as one facet  of the trial  court's\r\n\ndetermination of the quality of  the results obtained.  The court\r\n\nmay not employ the derived ratio as an independent  justification\r\n\nfor a fee  reduction.  See Rivera,  477 U.S. at 574.   Rather, in\r                                           \r\n\nthe absence of special circumstances, the court must evaluate the\r\n\ndata  submitted by the  fee-seeker, compute a  lodestar, consider\r\n\nthe totality of the adjustment  factors approved by Congress  and\r\n\nthe  Court,  see  supra  note  3,  and  make  specific,  reasoned\r                                 \r\n\nadjustments if it is to arrive at a reduced fee award.\r\n\n          In  the instant  case, the  court  did not  analyze the\r\n\nappellant's time-and-rate data; it  ignored the appellant's broad\r\n\nclaims-based success; and  it failed to explain why  the sum upon\r\n\nwhich it settled   $5,000   was itself  reasonable in relation to\r\n\ncounsel's efforts, even given a perceived shortfall in the relief\r\n\nreceived.  Thus,  the more than 90% fee reduction  that the court\r\n\nimposed cannot be justified on the basis of limited success.7\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7The district court's  reliance on Andrade (a  case in which\r                                                         \r\nthe trial judge ordered, and  this court approved, a reduction in\r\nfees  from  $26,487.50  to  $2,500)  is  misplaced.   There,  the\r\nplaintiffs  obtained  limited  claims-based success  and  limited\r                                                                  \r\nrelief.   See Andrade,  82 F.3d  at  1191.   In contrast,  Coutin\r                               \r\nobtained substantial claims-based success and rather  substantial\r\nrelief.  Hence, Andrade and this case are not fair congeners.\r                                 \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n                    B.

Settlement Prospects.\r                                                      \r\n\n          In  other   instances,  inquiry  into  the   course  of\r\n\nsettlement negotiations may  yield information that is  useful in\r\n\ndetermining fees.   See Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1985)\r                                                 \r\n\n(applying Fed. R. Civ. P.  68 in a civil rights context).  In the\r\n\ncase at bar,  however, the defendant did not  invoke Rule 68 and,\r\n\nin any event, the judgment  that the plaintiff obtained more than\r\n\ntrebled  the highest  settlement offer  available to  her.   This\r\n\nsuccess  validates  the  appellant's rejection  of  the  tendered\r\n\nsettlement and immunizes her  from detrimental consequences based\r\n\nupon that  rejection. See Corder  v. Gates, 947 F.2d  374, 380-81\r                                                    \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          Policy   considerations   militate   strongly   against\r\n\nrelaxing this rule.  Permitting a district court to reduce  a fee\r\n\naward for failure  to settle when  the eventual judgment  exceeds\r\n\nthe best  settlement offer  previously made by  the losing  party\r\n\nwould put too large a club in the district court's hands.  In the\r\n\nbargain, endorsing that  praxis would create inordinate  pressure\r\n\non plaintiffs to accept low settlement offers.  This result would\r\n\ninhibit the  bringing of civil  rights actions, and, in  the end,\r\n\nfrustrate   Congress's  manifest  intention  that  the  Fees  Act\r\n\nfacilitate  the prosecution of private actions aimed at deterring\r\n\ncivil  rights abuses.    See  Rivera, 477  U.S.  at 574-75.    We\r                                              \r\n\ntherefore hold that it is a mistake of law to reduce an award  of\r\n\nattorneys'  fees  in  a  civil  rights  case  in  response  to  a\r\n\nplaintiff's  rejection of a defendant's settlement offer when the\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nsubsequent judgment exceeds that offer.8\r\n\n                          C.

See supra note 2.\r                                                                   \r\n\nWholly apart  from the accuracy  vel non of the  district court's\r                                                  \r\n\nassessment, this  criterion is not  a proper element of  the fee-\r\n\naward calculus.\r\n\n          Congress  intended  the  Fees Act  to  effect  attorney\r\n\ncompensation in  virtually all  cases involving  successful civil\r\n\nrights claims.9    See  generally  S. Rep.  No.  94-1011  (1976),\r                                           \r\n\nreprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5908; see also Williams v. Hanover\r                                                                           \r\n\nHous. Auth., 113 F.3d 1294, 1300 (1st Cir. 1997).  After a jury's\r                     \r\n\nverdict has been rendered  and has withstood whatever barrage  of\r\n\npost-trial motions may  ensue, the time  for debate has  expired.\r\n\nIt is an  abuse of discretion for  the trial court thereafter  to\r\n\nvent  its skepticism  about the  claimant's right  to recover  by\r\n\nreducing the fee award to which the prevailing party is entitled.\r\n\nSee Stefan  v. Laurenitis, 889  F.2d 363, 370-71 (1st  Cir. 1989)\r                                   \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8This  case does not present the somewhat different question\r\nof whether a  fee award in a civil rights action might be subject\r\nto   reduction,  apart  from  Rule  68,  because  the  prevailing\r\nplaintiff  received  a  damage  award  which  was  less  than the\r\ndefendant had offered in settlement.   We leave that question for\r\nanother day.\r\n\n     9Despite this  policy  interest,  we  have  determined  that\r\ncounsel  fees may be withheld altogether if special circumstances\r\nexist.   See Domegan v. Ponte, 972 F.2d 401, 419 (1st Cir. 1992);\r                                       \r\nLewis v. Kendrick,  944 F.2d 949, 957-58  (1st Cir. 1991).   Such\r                           \r\ncircumstances are rare.  They are not present here.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\n(refusing to  allow district courts  to balance equities  of this\r\n\nsort  when considering  whether to  award  attorneys' fees  under\r\n\nsection 1988); see  also DeJesus v. Banco Popular,  918 F.2d 232,\r                                                           \r\n\n235 (1st Cir. 1990).  In other words,  the time for a trial judge\r\n\nto express his doubts about the viability  of a claim occurs when\r\n\nthe judge rules upon the full panoply of motions for judgment  as\r\n\na  matter of law and/or for a new  trial.  Once a case has scaled\r\n\nthose barriers    and  this case has    trimming  attorneys' fees\r\n\ncannot be employed  as a palliative  to assuage lingering  doubts\r\n\nabout the legal viability of the claim.  See DeJesus, 918 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n235.   Indeed, if a  plaintiff has  a thin  case but  nonetheless\r\n\nmanages, as here, to secure a verdict for three times the largest\r\n\nsettlement  offer, such  a  template suggests  skillful advocacy,\r\n\nperhaps worthy of an award of full fees.\r\n\n                          D.  Local Law.\r                                    D.  Local Law.\r                                                 \r\n\n          Wholly apart  from the district court's  rationale, Y&amp;R\r\n\nhas  a  fallback   position.    It  posits   that,  whatever  the\r\n\ninfirmities of the $5,000 fee  award under federal law, the award\r\n\ncomports with  Puerto Rico  law and should  be sustained  on that\r\n\nbasis.  This  thesis, which proposes that Puerto  Rico law should\r\n\ngovern in respect to fees  because the appellant prevailed on her\r\n\nnon-federal claims and  recovered double damages by  operation of\r\n\nPuerto Rico law, fails for two reasons.\r\n\n          First, under section 1988 \"the plaintiff is entitled to\r\n\nfees for  hours worked  not only on  the successful  civil rights\r\n\nclaims,  but also  on other  claims involving  a `common  core of\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nfacts' or `related legal theories,'\" and, therefore, a \"plaintiff\r\n\nshould receive significant fees when he has won a partial victory\r                                                                   \r\n\non a civil  rights claim while receiving substantially the relief\r\n\nhe  there sought,  though the  jury awards  it on a  factually or\r\n\nlegally related pendent state claim.\"   Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n287, 291  (1st Cir. 1986)  (quoting Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 435).10\r                                                     \r\n\nHere, where the elements of  the various claims under Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw  are  subsumed  by  the  Title  VII  claim,  the  claims  are\r\n\nunquestionably  interrelated.  Hence, the fact that the appellant\r\n\nalso recovered under Puerto Rico  law is irrelevant vis- -vis her\r\n\nsection 1988 recovery.\r\n\n          Second, as a  general matter, a plaintiff  who prevails\r\n\non congruent  federal  and state  claims and  qualifies for  fee-\r\n\nshifting  under  two  or more  statutes  may  recover  fees under\r\n\nwhichever  fee-shifting regime  she  chooses.    See  Freeman  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nPackage  Mach.  Co., 865  F.2d 1331,  1347 (1st  Cir. 1988).   To\r                             \r\n\nconstrain  the plaintiff's  choice would  withhold  from her  the\r\n\ndeserved fruits  of her  victory and  would discourage  potential\r\n\nclaimants from redeeming their civil rights.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We  need go  no further.   The  court below  offered no\r\n\nplausible reason for eschewing the  lodestar method, and no  such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10In Aubin, the plaintiff  prevailed on interrelated federal\r                         \r\nand state claims,  recovering $501 on the former  and $300,000 on\r\nthe  latter.  782  F.2d at 288.   The district  court reduced the\r\nrequested attorneys' fees on a  theory much like that advanced by\r\nY&amp;R.   See id.  at 290.  We  overturned that ruling.   See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n292.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nreason springs spontaneously from the record.  It was, therefore,\r\n\nerror to  forgo the lodestar.   In addition, the court  relied on\r\n\nimpermissible  criteria in  making  its  non-lodestar fee  award.\r\n\nConsequently,  we vacate the  order appealed from  and remand for\r\n\nfurther  proceedings  consistent  with this  opinion.    Costs on\r\n\nappeal shall be taxed in favor of the appellant.  Upon the timely\r\n\nfiling  of a  supplemental  application  in  suitable  form,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  shall  include  in  its  new  fee  award  a  sum\r\n\nsufficient  to compensate  the appellant's  counsel for  services\r\n\nrendered  in connection with  the successful prosecution  of this\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                    It is so ordered.\r                                    \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n",

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          On December  30, 1993,  the appellant  sued her  former\r\n\nemployer, defendant-appellee Young &amp; Rubicam of Puerto Rico, Inc.\r\n\n(Y&amp;R), an advertising agency, for over $1,500,000 in compensatory\r\n\nand punitive  damages.   Her complaint  advanced one  substantive\r\n\nfederal  claim:   that Y&amp;R had  violated Title  VII of  the Civil\r\n\nRights  Act of  1964,  42  U.S.C.     2000e  to 2000e-17  (1994),\r\n\nincluding  the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.   2000e(k)\r\n\n(1994), by (1) assigning Coutin  (who was then pregnant) to tasks\r\n\nthat were  detrimental to her physical and  emotional health, (2)\r\n\nrequiring her to work under unsafe conditions, (3) condoning (or,\r\n\nat least, neglecting to curb) her coworkers' disparaging comments\r\n\nabout her gravidity, and (4) constructively discharging her.  The\r\n\ncomplaint  also  included  several claims  under  local  law, the\r\n\nelements of  which were  subsumed, without  exception, under  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Coutin's  spouse  and their  conjugal partnership  are also\r\nplaintiffs  and appellants  in this  litigation.   Because  their\r\nrights derive from Coutin's, we  opt for simplicity and treat the\r\nappeal as if Coutin were the sole plaintiff and appellant.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nbroader federal claim.\r\n\n          Y&amp;R denied  Coutin's allegations and defended  the suit\r\n\nwith considerable vigor.  Along the way, the parties attempted to\r\n\nreach  an  accord, but  they  came  no closer  than  a demand  of\r\n\n$150,000 as against an offer of $15,000.  At trial, the appellant\r\n\n(who  had secured  and  retained  other  employment)  offered  no\r\n\nevidence of  lost income, and  that aspect of her  original claim\r\n\nwas  pretermitted.  The  case went to the  jury, which found that\r\n\nY&amp;R had intentionally  discriminated against, and  constructively\r\n\ndischarged, the appellant, thus violating both federal and Puerto\r\n\nRico law.   The jury awarded the appellant and her spouse a total\r\n\nof $44,000 in  compensatory damages, plus an additional $1,538 in\r\n\nseverance  pay under  Law  80, P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit.  29,    185a\r\n\n(1985).

The  fee\r\n\napplication contained  a sworn statement delineating her lawyer's\r\n\ntwo   decades  of  experience  in  personal  injury,  labor,  and\r\n\ndiscrimination  cases,  as  well  as  extensive,  contemporaneous\r\n\nbilling  records  that  detailed  the  lawyer's  work  over  four\r\n\ncalendar years.

But  the  court's\r\n\nreliance on the first of  these factors is at best insufficiently\r\n\nexplained, and its  reliance on the other two  factors is plainly\r\n\nwrong.

To  be sure, as\r\n\nthe  court pointed  out, there  was  a chasmal  gulf between  the\r\n\ndamages requested in the complaint and the damages awarded.4  The\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4In  making this  comparison, the  court  emphasized the  ad\r\ndamnum.   The use of  the ad damnum  for this purpose  is suspect\r\nbecause the ad damnum is an inherently artificial construct.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ncourt had a right to keep this discrepancy in mind, but it cannot\r\n\namount to more  than one element in the  constellation of factors\r\n\nthat  the court  considers when  determining the  quality  of the\r\n\nresults  obtained.     Because  this   phenomenon  is   sometimes\r\n\nmisunderstood, we take some pains to explain it.\r\n\n          As Judge  Casellas correctly noted,  the Supreme  Court\r\n\nhas  identified results obtained as a preeminent consideration in\r\n\nthe fee-adjustment process.   See Hensley, 461 U.S.  at 432, 440.\r                                                   \r\n\nBut  the term \"results obtained\"  has a variety  of meanings.  It\r\n\ncan refer  to a  plaintiff's success  claim by  claim, or  to the\r\n\nrelief actually  achieved, or to  the societal importance  of the\r\n\nright which has been vindicated,  or to all of these  measures in\r\n\ncombination.  We think that the  last meaning is the best choice,\r\n\nand  that,  as  a  consequence,  all  three  types  of  \"results\"\r\n\npotentially bear upon  the amount of an  ensuing fee award.

See, e.g., Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940-41.  On\r                                                  \r\n\nthe other hand,  a fee reduction in  response to a scanty  damage\r\n\naward  or  a  shortfall  in  other relief  entails  a  subjective\r\n\nevaluation  of damages  awarded and nonmonetary  relief obtained,\r\n\nand is substantially  more difficult to quantify.5   Seen in this\r\n\nlight, the  computational principles  applicable to  claims-based\r\n\nfee reductions are relatively simple and straightforward, whereas\r\n\nthe  computational  principles  applicable  to  relief-based  fee\r\n\nreductions are highly  ramified and, in some respects, operate at\r\n\ncross  purposes.    To visualize  how  these  sometimes competing\r\n\nprinciples may  affect a district  court's effort to  determine a\r\n\n\"reasonable\"  fee,  it  may be  helpful  to  catalog the  several\r\n\npossible configurations in which the issue may arise.\r\n\n          1.   If a plaintiff  prevails on only some  of multiple\r                    1.\r\n\nclaims,  then  a  fee reduction  may  be  in  order.    To  guide\r\n\ndecisionmaking in this situation, the Justices have suggested two\r\n\nrelevant questions:  \"First, did the plaintiff fail to prevail on\r\n\nclaims that were  unrelated to the claims on  which he succeeded?\r\n\nSecond, did the  plaintiff achieve a level of  success that makes\r\n\nthe hours reasonably expended  a satisfactory basis for making  a\r\n\nfee award?\"  Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434.\r                              \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5This  is equally true of  the vindication of rights (which,\r\nto the  extent it  may be relevant  here, plainly cuts  against a\r\nreduction in fees).\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n          When different claims for relief are not interconnected\r\n\n  that  is, when  the claims  rest on  different facts  and legal\r\n\ntheories    they  are  by  definition  severable  and  unrelated.\r\n\nAttorneys' fees normally should not  be awarded for time spent in\r\n\nlitigating  (or preparing  to  litigate) unsuccessful,  severable\r\n\nclaims.  See id. at 435; Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 940.\r                                          \r\n\n          2.   If a plaintiff prevails on an insubstantial subset\r                    2.\r\n\nof her interrelated  claims and obtains only  limited relief, the\r\n\ntrial  court  has  discretion  to  shrink  fees  to  reflect that\r\n\ninferior  result.

This\r\n\ndissonance makes it  all the more crucial that a nisi prius court\r\n\nprovide a  clear explanation  when limited  relief furnishes  the\r\n\nostensible justification for a departure from the lodestar.\r\n\n          Conscious of these differing configurations, we turn to\r\n\nthe case  at hand.  The focus of our inquiry is the lower court's\r\n\ndetermination  that the  appellant's  success was  limited  (and,\r\n\nthus, justified a fee reduction).\r\n\n          We  start by  scrutinizing claims-based  success.   Y&amp;R\r\n\nasserts that Coutin's victory was less than complete both because\r\n\nthe  jury  declined to  grant  punitive damages  and  because the\r\n\nappellant did not pursue her original prayer for lost income.  We\r\n\nbelieve  that this riposte  blurs the distinction  between claims\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nand  damages.   In  the  fee-shifting context,  a  \"claim\" is  an\r\n\nallegation of  a legal injury  comprised of various  elements and\r\n\nequivalent to  a  cause  of action,  whereas  \"damages\"  are  the\r\n\ncompensation  awarded to the  plaintiff who has  suffered a legal\r\n\nwrong and who therefore has  a valid claim against the defendant.\r\n\nIn this case, punitive damages and loss of income (no matter  how\r\n\nthey are denominated in the complaint) are not failed claims, but\r\n\nare  categories  of relief  that  the  jury and  the  appellant's\r\n\nsubsequent employment history, respectively, have denied her.\r\n\n          We  need not linger.  From a claim-by-claim standpoint,\r\n\nthe  appellant prevailed up and down  the line.  She triumphed on\r\n\nevery  substantive claim asserted  under both federal  and Puerto\r\n\nRico law.   In so doing, she  achieved a 100% success  rate   and\r\n\ncomplete  success is hardly  \"limited.\"  Consequently,  a claims-\r\n\nbased, results-obtained fee reduction is wholly inappropriate.\r\n\n          From the  standpoint of relief obtained,  the situation\r\n\nis more  ambiguous.   After all, it  remains within  the district\r\n\ncourt's discretion to  reduce a fee award in  response to limited\r\n\nrelief even  in the  presence of  complete claims-based  success.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Cartwright v.

We\r                                              \r\n\ntherefore hold that it is a mistake of law to reduce an award  of\r\n\nattorneys'  fees  in  a  civil  rights  case  in  response  to  a\r\n\nplaintiff's  rejection of a defendant's settlement offer when the\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nsubsequent judgment exceeds that offer.8\r\n\n                          C.

See supra note 2.\r                                                                   \r\n\nWholly apart  from the accuracy  vel non of the  district court's\r                                                  \r\n\nassessment, this  criterion is not  a proper element of  the fee-\r\n\naward calculus.\r\n\n          Congress  intended  the  Fees Act  to  effect  attorney\r\n\ncompensation in  virtually all  cases involving  successful civil\r\n\nrights claims.9    See  generally  S. Rep.  No.  94-1011  (1976),\r                                           \r\n\nreprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5908; see also Williams v.

After a jury's\r                     \r\n\nverdict has been rendered  and has withstood whatever barrage  of\r\n\npost-trial motions may  ensue, the time  for debate has  expired.\r\n\nIt is an  abuse of discretion for  the trial court thereafter  to\r\n\nvent  its skepticism  about the  claimant's right  to recover  by\r\n\nreducing the fee award to which the prevailing party is entitled.\r\n\nSee Stefan  v.

We leave that question for\r\nanother day.\r\n\n     9Despite this  policy  interest,  we  have  determined  that\r\ncounsel  fees may be withheld altogether if special circumstances\r\nexist.

In other words,  the time for a trial judge\r\n\nto express his doubts about the viability  of a claim occurs when\r\n\nthe judge rules upon the full panoply of motions for judgment  as\r\n\na  matter of law and/or for a new  trial.  Once a case has scaled\r\n\nthose barriers    and  this case has    trimming  attorneys' fees\r\n\ncannot be employed  as a palliative  to assuage lingering  doubts\r\n\nabout the legal viability of the claim.  See DeJesus, 918 F.2d at\r                                                              \r\n\n235.   Indeed, if a  plaintiff has  a thin  case but  nonetheless\r\n\nmanages, as here, to secure a verdict for three times the largest\r\n\nsettlement  offer, such  a  template suggests  skillful advocacy,\r\n\nperhaps worthy of an award of full fees.\r\n\n                          D.  Local Law.\r                                    D.

It  posits   that,  whatever  the\r\n\ninfirmities of the $5,000 fee  award under federal law, the award\r\n\ncomports with  Puerto Rico  law and should  be sustained  on that\r\n\nbasis.  This  thesis, which proposes that Puerto  Rico law should\r\n\ngovern in respect to fees  because the appellant prevailed on her\r\n\nnon-federal claims and  recovered double damages by  operation of\r\n\nPuerto Rico law, fails for two reasons.\r\n\n          First, under section 1988 \"the plaintiff is entitled to\r\n\nfees for  hours worked  not only on  the successful  civil rights\r\n\nclaims,  but also  on other  claims involving  a `common  core of\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nfacts' or `related legal theories,'\" and, therefore, a \"plaintiff\r\n\nshould receive significant fees when he has won a partial victory\r                                                                   \r\n\non a civil  rights claim while receiving substantially the relief\r\n\nhe  there sought,  though the  jury awards  it on a  factually or\r\n\nlegally related pendent state claim.\"   Aubin v.

The  court below  offered no\r\n\nplausible reason for eschewing the  lodestar method, and no  such\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10In Aubin, the plaintiff  prevailed on interrelated federal\r                         \r\nand state claims,  recovering $501 on the former  and $300,000 on\r\nthe  latter.  782  F.2d at 288.   The district  court reduced the\r\nrequested attorneys' fees on a  theory much like that advanced by\r\nY&amp;R.   See id.  at 290.  We  overturned that ruling.   See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n292.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nreason springs spontaneously from the record.  It was, therefore,\r\n\nerror to  forgo the lodestar.   In addition, the court  relied on\r\n\nimpermissible  criteria in  making  its  non-lodestar fee  award.\r\n\nConsequently,  we vacate the  order appealed from  and remand for\r\n\nfurther  proceedings  consistent  with this  opinion.    Costs on\r\n\nappeal shall be taxed in favor of the appellant.  Upon the timely\r\n\nfiling  of a  supplemental  application  in  suitable  form,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  shall  include  in  its  new  fee  award  a  sum\r\n\nsufficient  to compensate  the appellant's  counsel for  services\r\n\nrendered  in connection with  the successful prosecution  of this\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n          It is so ordered.\r                    It is so ordered.\r                                    \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n</pre>",
