We affirm.\n\n                   I. PERTINENT FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                              A. THE “BID-BUMP” PROCEDURE\n\n         This case primarily involves a matter of statutory interpretation and the pertinent facts are\nundisputed. Charging party and respondent are parties to a collective bargaining agreement\n(CBA) that expired on or about August 25, 2011. The expired CBA contained sections that\ndescribed, among other matters, a procedure for the assignment of vacant teaching positions.\nThe CBA called for a meeting, referred to by the parties as a “bid-bump” meeting or “teacher\nassignment meeting” that was to take place near the end of the school year, in either April, May,\nor June. For the sake of simplicity, the purpose of the “bid-bump” meeting, as set forth in the\nnow-expired CBA, was to permit teachers to bid on open positions, based on a number of\ncriteria. According to charging party, it had utilized the bid-bump procedure for approximately\n27 years.\n\n                                      B. MCL 423.215(3)(j)\n\n       The Public Employee Relations Act (PERA), MCL 423.201 et seq., establishes, among\nother matters, the duties of public employers and public employees with regard to collective\nbargaining. MCL 423.215(3) sets forth prohibited subjects of bargaining between a public\nschool employer and the bargaining representative of its employees. The matters described as\n“prohibited subjects of bargaining “are within the sole authority of the public school employer to\n\n                                                 -1-\n\fdecide.” MCL 423.215(4). Historically, PERA did not include decisions regarding the\nplacement of teachers among the prohibited subjects of bargaining. In 2011, the Legislature\nenacted a series of amendments to PERA and expanded the list of prohibited subjects of\nbargaining between public school employers and employees. 2011 PA 103, which became\neffective July 19, 2011, added several prohibited subjects, including as set forth in MCL\n423.215(3)(j). MCL 423.215(3)(j) prohibits bargaining with regard to:\n\n       Any decision made by the public school employer regarding teacher placement, or\n       the impact of that decision on an individual employee or the bargaining unit.1\n\n                          C. UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE\n\n        In the spring of 2012, respondent did not hold the bid-bump meeting despite three\nrequests by charging party. Charging party filed an unfair labor practice charge in July 2012,\nciting the failure to hold a bid-bump meeting as set forth in the CBA.2 In response, respondent\nargued that the enactment of MCL 423.215(3)(j) removed any duty to bargain over teacher-\nplacement decisions and gave it unilateral authority to make decisions relating to teacher\nplacement. According to respondent, it was no longer required to employ the bid-bump\nprocedure described in the now-expired CBA. Following oral argument, the Administrative Law\nJudge (ALJ) agreed with respondent and issued a recommended decision and order dismissing\nthe unfair labor practice charge. Accepting as true the facts alleged by charging party, the ALJ\ndenied charging party’s request for an evidentiary hearing as it found that there were no disputed\nissues of fact. The ALJ also found that the language of § 15(3)(j) was clear and that it prohibited\nbargaining over any decision pertaining to teacher placement, including the bid-bump procedure.\n\n        Charging party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s recommended decision and order and\nrequested oral argument and an evidentiary hearing. In a written opinion and order, MERC\ndenied the request for oral argument and an evidentiary hearing, finding that neither would aid in\nits decision. MERC adopted the ALJ’s factual summary. As to the interpretation of § 15(j)(3),\nMERC rejected charging party’s exceptions and found that the ALJ did not err in its\n\n\n\n\n1\n   2011 PA 103 added §15(3)(j) to MCL 423.215, prohibiting as a subject of bargaining “Any\ndecision made by the public school employer regarding the placement of teachers, or the impact\nof that decision on an individual employee or the bargaining unit.” 2012 PA 45, which became\neffective March 13, 2012, amended § 15(3)(j), changing the phrase “the placement of teachers”\nto the phrase “teacher placement.” The 2012 version was in effect at the time charging party\nfiled its claim of unfair labor practice in July 2012; that same version remains in effect today.\nSee MCL 423.215(3)(j).\n\n\n2\n  Although the CBA expired on August 25, 2011, charging party contended that during\nnegotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement, respondent was required to\nmaintain the status quo with respect to mandatory subjects of bargaining.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\finterpretation of the statute. MERC dismissed charging party’s unfair labor practice charge in its\nentirety. This appeal followed.\n\n                         II. INTERPRETATION OF MCL 423.215(3)(j)\n\n                                 A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Our review of MERC’s interpretation of MCL 423.215(3)(j) is de novo. Decatur Pub\nSchs v Van Buren Co Ed Ass’n, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket No. 320272, issued\nMarch 17, 2015), slip op at 5. However, we note that our Supreme Court has explained that “an\nagency’s interpretation of a statute is entitled to ‘respectful consideration,’ but courts may not\nabdicate their judicial responsibility to interpret statutes by giving unfettered deference to an\nagency’s interpretation. Courts must respect legislative decisions and interpret statutes according\nto their plain language.” In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich, 482 Mich 90, 93; 754\nNW2d 259 (2008). This standard requires “cogent reasons” for overruling an agency’s\ninterpretation.” Id. at 103. “However, the agency’s interpretation is not binding on the courts,\nand it cannot conflict with the Legislature’s intent as expressed in the language of the statute at\nissue.” Id.\n\n                         B. PERA AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING\n\n        “PERA governs the relationship between public employees and governmental agencies.”\nDecatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 5. The act imposes upon public employers a\nmandatory duty to bargain over certain subjects, such as “wages hours, and other terms and\nconditions of employment . . . .” MCL 423.215(1). See also Decatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at\n__, slip op at 6. While PERA requires bargaining on some subjects, § 15(3) sets forth subjects\nthat are prohibited from bargaining. See Mt Pleasant Pub Schs v Michigan AFSCME Council\n25, 302 Mich App 600, 608-609; 840 NW2d 750 (2013). “Except as otherwise provided in\nsubsection (3)(f),[3] the matters described in subsection (3) are prohibited subjects of bargaining\nbetween a public school employer and a bargaining representative of its employees, and, for the\npurposes of this act, are within the sole authority of the public school employer to decide.” MCL\n423.215(4). If there is no duty to bargain over the subject matter, the employer can take\nunilateral action. Decatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 10. This Court has explained\nthat, when the list of prohibited subjects of bargaining found in subsection 3 is read together with\nsubsection 4, the subsections “evince a legislative intent to make public school employers solely\nresponsible for these subjects by prohibiting them from being the subjects of enforceable\ncontract provisions and by eliminating any duty to bargain regarding them.” Michigan State\nAFL-CIO v Michigan Employment Relations Comm, 212 Mich App 472, 487; 538 NW2d 433\n(1995).\n\n       2011 PA 103 expanded the list of prohibited subjects of bargaining. Pertinent to this\ncase, 2011 PA 103 added § 15(3)(j), which expanded the prohibited subjects of bargaining to\n\n\n3\n  As referenced above, § 15(3)(f) pertains to decisions to contract with third parties for\nnoninstructional support services and is not implicated in this case.\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\finclude “Any decision made by the public school employer regarding teacher placement, or the\nimpact of that decision on an individual employee or the bargaining unit.” MCL 423.215(3)(j).\nThe salient issue in this case is whether § 15(3)(j) and the prohibition on bargaining over “[a]ny\ndecision” regarding “teacher placement” applies to the bid-bump procedure.\n\n      The starting point for this inquiry is the plain language of the statute. Decatur Pub Schs,\n__ Mich App at __, slip op at 7.\n\n       [I]n interpreting a statute, we consider both the plain meaning of the critical word\n       or phrase as well as its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme. As with\n       any statutory interpretation, our goal is to give effect to the intent of the\n       Legislature by focusing on the statute’s plain language. Speicher v Columbia Twp\n       Bd of Trustees, 497 Mich 125, 133-134; 860 NW2d 51 (2014) (citations and\n       quotation marks omitted).]\n\nIf statutory language is clear, we must enforce the statute as it is written. Braska v Challenge\nMfg Co, 307 Mich App 340, 352; 861 NW2d 289 (2014). We may consult a dictionary to\ndetermine the plain and ordinary meaning of statutory terms that are undefined. Spartan Stores,\nInc v Grand Rapids, 307 Mich App 565, 574; 861 NW2d 347 (2014).\n\n                                      C. APPLICATION\n\n         Turning to the statute at issue, § 15(3)(j) provides that collective bargaining between a\npublic school employer and a bargaining representative of its employees “shall not include”\n“[a]ny decision made by the public school employer regarding teacher placement, or the impact\nof that decision on an individual employee or bargaining unit.” MCL 423.215(3)(j) (emphasis\nadded). The word “any” is not defined in the statute, but is commonly understood to be all-\nencompassing, meaning “every” or “all” and can be “used to indicate one selected without\nrestriction” or can be used “to indicate a maximum or whole.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary (11th ed). The word, “decision,” meanwhile, is defined to mean “the act or process\nof deciding.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed). The term “placement” as\nused in the statute is commonly understood to refer to “an act or instance of placing” or “the\nassignment of a person to a suitable place (as a job or a class in school).” Merriam-Webster’s\nCollegiate Dictionary (11th ed).\n\n        Given the broad language employed in § 15(3)(j), we find that the Legislature intended to\nprohibit an employer from bargaining over any decision, including policies or procedures such as\nthe bid-bump procedure, with regard to teacher placement. The plain language of the statute\ngives broad discretion to public school employers to make “[a]ny decision,” i.e., every, or all\ndecisions, “unmeasured or unlimited in amount, number or extent,” regarding or concerning\nteacher placement. The statute contains no limitations on the employer. Also, the statute refers\nto decisions, which include the act or process of deciding. By stating that there was no duty to\nbargain over “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher placement and providing no limitation or\nexplanation thereafter, the Legislature demonstrated its intent to afford public school employers\nbroad discretion over any type of teacher placement decision or the impact of that decision on\nindividual teachers or the bargaining unit as a whole. Cf. People v Cunningham, 496 Mich 145,\n154-155; 852 NW2d 118 (2014) (reasoning that where the Legislature provided courts with the\n\n                                               -4-\n\fauthority to impose “any cost” in MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(ii) and thereafter specified with\nparticularity the costs that could be imposed, such language “suggests strongly that the\nLegislature did not intend MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority\nto impose ‘any cost.’ ”). In other words, the Legislature intended to remove from the ambit of\nbargaining any decision concerning the assignment or placement of teachers, and that any\ndecision-making about teacher placement or assignments is to be within the sole discretion of the\nemployer. The broad language used in the statute necessarily includes any decision-making\nprocess as well; consequently, policies and procedures used to make teacher placement decisions\nsuch as those at issue in the instant case undoubtedly fall within the broad reach of “any\ndecision” regarding teacher placement. Therefore, the plain language of § 15(3)(j) precludes\nbargaining over the bid-bump procedure, or any other procedure utilized in teacher placement.\n\n        With regard to charging party’s argument about placement policies and procedures, we\nfind that it would make little sense that a public school employer could be compelled to bargain\nabout an overarching placement plan or process, e.g., the bid-bump procedure previously\nemployed in the instant case, yet have no duty to bargain over the placement decisions that result\nfrom that plan. Indeed, the decision-making process or plan would be of little import if the\nemployer could simply make any decision it wanted about placement, regardless of the plan or\nprocedure. Also, such a result would be contrary to the broad language employed in the statute.\n“When construing a statute, a court should not abandon the cannons of common sense.” In re\nConsumers Energy, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket Nos. 314361; 316868, issued May\n28, 2015), slip op at 6 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, construing the statute in\nthe manner proposed by charging party is not appropriate.\n\n        Charging party argues that the phrase “teacher placement” limits the scope of an\nemployer’s decision-making to decisions involving individual teachers. This argument is not\nsupported by the text of the statute. The term “teacher placement” could equally refer to the\nplacement of a single teacher or to the act of placing multiple teachers, and charging party\nprovides no cogent argument as to why it should be limited to a single teacher. To read the\nstatute in the manner proposed by charging party would essentially require this Court to read the\nstatute as applying to “[a]ny decision” applying to individual teachers regarding specific\nassignments, when the Legislature did not see fit to include such language in the statute. This\nCourt cannot do so. Mich Ed Ass'n v Secretary of State (On Rehearing), 489 Mich 194, 217; 801\nNW2d 35 (2011) (“nothing may be read into a statute that is not within the manifest intent of the\nLegislature as derived from the act itself.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Furthermore,\ncharging party’s attempt to segregate the phrase “teacher placement” from the rest of the\nlanguage employed in § 15(3)(j) is an inappropriate way to assess the intent of the Legislature.\nSee Speicher, 497 Mich at 138 (“An attempt to segregate any portion or exclude any portion of a\nstatute from consideration is almost certain to distort legislative intent.”). Rather, the phrase\nmust be construed in context. When viewed in context, the phrase “teacher placement” is\nintended to refer to the placement of an individual teacher or to the placement of multiple\nteachers. As noted, the phrase “teacher placement” follows the phrase “[a]ny decision.” To\nconstrue the phrase “teacher placement” as applying to only those decisions made about\nindividual teachers would significantly limit and undermine the broad, encompassing phrase,\n“[a]ny decision” used by the Legislature. In addition, § 15(3)(j) provides, in pertinent part, that\nthere is no duty to bargain over teacher placement, “or the impact of that decision on an\nindividual employee or the bargaining unit.” (Emphasis added). This language does not suggest\n\n                                                -5-\n\fthat “teacher placement” is meant to refer only to decisions about specific teachers, as it invokes\nthe “bargaining unit” as a whole, as well as individual teachers.\n\n        Charging party argues that reading MCL 423.215 in context compels the conclusion that\nits interpretation of the statute is correct. It notes that several other prohibited subjects of\nbargaining in § 15 exclude from bargaining decisions “about the development, content,\nstandards, procedures, adoption, and implementation” of the public school employer’s policies\nand procedures in certain areas. See MCL 423.215(3)(k) (providing that a public school\nemployer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to “[d]ecisions about the development,\ncontent, standards, procedures, adoption, and implementation of the public school employer's\npolicies regarding personnel decisions when conducting a staffing or program reduction or any\nother personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position . . . .”); MCL\n423.215(3)(l) (a public school employer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to\n“[d]ecisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and\nimplementation of a public school employer's performance evaluation system . . . .); MCL\n423.215(3)(m) (a public school employer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to\n“decisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and implementation\nof a policy regarding discharge or discipline of an employee, decisions concerning the discharge\nor discipline of an individual employee, or the impact of those decisions on an individual\nemployee or the bargaining unit.”); MCL 423.215(3)(o) (a public school employer does not have\na duty to bargain about “[d]ecisions about the development, format, content, and procedures of\nthe notification to parents and legal guardians required under [MCL 380.1249a]” regarding\nteachers who have been rated as “ineffective.”). Charging party’s argument is unavailing. As\nnoted, the plain language of § 15(3)(j) provides broad, unilateral discretion to the public school\nemployer with regard to “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher placement. Charging party’s\nproposed construction would be inconsistent with that language. And, it would make little sense\nto give an employer this broad authority yet require the employer to bargain over an overarching\npolicy regarding teacher placement, particularly a policy such as the bid-bump policy employed\nin the instant case wherein teachers had authority over placement and transfer decisions.\n\n        Charging party also argues that an earlier draft of 2011 PA 2013 compels this Court to\ninterpret § 15(3)(j) in the manner it proposes. Courts may consider legislative history, including\n“the changes in the bill during its passage.” Dep’t of Transp v Thrasher, 196 Mich App 320,\n323; 493 NW2d 457 (1992), aff’d 446 Mich (1994). See also Klida v Braman, 278 Mich App\n60, 70; 748 NW2d 244 (2008). Here, charging party notes that as initially proposed by the\nHouse, § 15(3)(j) provided:\n\n       (j) Decisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption,\n       and implementation of the public school employer’s policy for placement of\n       teachers required under section 1247 of the revised school code, 1976 PA 451,\n       MCL 380.1247,[4] any decision made by the public school employer pursuant to\n\n\n4\n MCL 380.1247 was repealed by 1995 PA 289, effective July 1, 1996. In pertinent part, MCL\n380.1247(c) provided that “an administrator or administrators, usually called a building\nprincipal,” “shall” among others, “[s]ubmit recommendations to the superintendent for the\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       that policy, or the impact of those decisions on an individual employee or the\n       bargaining unit. [2011 HB 4628.]\n\nCharging party finds significant the initial inclusion, but subsequent rejection, of language\npertaining to decisions about the “development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and\nimplementation of the public school employer’s policy for placement of teachers . . . .” Charging\nparty argues that 2011 HB 4628 demonstrates that the Legislature initially considered including\namong the lists of prohibited subjects of bargaining a public school employer’s decisions about\nprocedures and standards used in teacher placement decisions, but declined to adopt such a broad\npolicy. Instead, according to charging party, the Legislature elected to use the phrase “[a]ny\ndecision,” which charging party contends is not as broad in its scope as the language that was\ninitially proposed in 2011 HB 4628, but subsequently rejected.\n\n        Charging party’s citation to 2011 HB 4628 is unavailing. The plain language of\n§ 15(3)(j) is clear that it applies, without limitation, to “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher\nplacement. That the Legislature considered adding to the statute language pertaining to decisions\nabout policies and procedures for the placement of teachers and any decision pursuant to those\npolicies is of little consequence, given the broad prohibition that was eventually passed. Indeed,\nwe find the language that the Legislature eventually adopted in § 15(3)(j) is broader in scope\nthan the language proposed in 2011 HB 4628, as it applies to “[a]ny decision,” without\nlimitation. Decisions about policies and procedures regarding teacher placement would\nnecessarily fall within the ambit of “[a]ny decision” about teacher placement. We will not resort\nto legislative history to “cloud a statutory text that is clear.” In re Certified Question (Kenneth\nHenes Special Projects Procurement v Continental Biomass Indus, Inc), 468 Mich 109, 113; 659\nNW2d 597 (2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In sum, we find that the plain meaning of § 15(3)(j) demonstrates the intent of the\nLegislature to give public school employers discretion regarding a broad spectrum of teacher\nplacement decisions. This broad discretion applies not only to placement decisions themselves,\nbut also to any decision the employer makes in regard to how it decides to go about making those\ndecisions. Any decision regarding teacher placement, which is a prohibited subject of\nbargaining, cannot be the subject of a collective-bargaining agreement. See Baumgartner v\nPerry Pub Schs, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket Nos. 313945; 314158; 314696), slip op\nat 11 (interpreting MCL 423.215(3)(k), which provides that decisions about a school employer’s\npersonnel decisions are prohibited subjects of bargaining). There are no cogent reasons for\noverturning MERC’s interpretation of this statute. See In re Complaint of Rovas 482 Mich at\n103.\n\n       Charging party argues that MERC’s (and the ALJ’s) interpretation of the statute, with\nwhich we agree, is a “broad construction” of § 15(3)(j), and charging party encourages this Court\nto adopt a narrower construction. Contrary to charging party’s contentions, such interpretation\n\nappointment, assignment, promotion, or dismissal of personnel assigned to supervision of the\nadministrator.” Legislative history reveals that the Legislature contemplated bringing back and\naltering the now-defunct MCL 380.1247 at the time it considered the passage of 2011 HB 4628.\nSee House Legislative Analysis, HB 4625-4628, May 10, 2011.\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fof the statute does not constitute a broad construction; rather, it constitutes an interpretation of\nthe statute as it is written. As written, the statute is broad in its scope and application. We must\nadhere to the plain language of the statute and the intent of the Legislature as expressed plainly\ntherein. Our role is to interpret the law and to apply statutes as they are written, not to question\nthe Legislature or to alter plain statutory language.5 See Johnson v Recca, 492 Mich 169, 187;\n821 NW2d 520 (2012).\n\n                               III. REMAINING CHALLENGES\n\n        Charging party next raises issues concerning MERC’s factual findings, its failure to hold\nan evidentiary hearing, and its failure to permit additional oral argument. MERC’s factual\nfindings are conclusive “if they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence\non the record considered as a whole.” Van Buren Co Ed Ass’n, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 5.\n“This evidentiary standard is equal to the amount of evidence that a reasonable mind would\naccept as sufficient to support a conclusion. While it consists of more than a scintilla of\nevidence, it may be substantially less than a preponderance.” Mt Pleasant Pub Schs, 302 Mich\nApp at 615 (citation and quotation marks omitted). With regard to charging party’s argument\nthat MERC erred by failing to hold oral argument or an evidentiary hearing, our review is for an\nabuse of discretion. See MCL 423.216(b) (explaining that MERC “may”6 take further testimony\nor “hear argument” after the hearing before the ALJ); Sault Ste Marie Area Pub Schs v Mich Ed\nAss’n, 213 Mich App 176, 182; 539 NW2d 565 (1995).\n\n                              A. MERC’S FACTUAL FINDINGS\n\n        Charging party first contests the sufficiency of MERC’s factual findings, arguing that\nthose findings failed to accurately describe the bid-bump procedure. In evaluating this issue, we\nnote that both the ALJ and MERC accepted as true the facts alleged by charging party and that\nthey both described the facts in this case as being undisputed. Rather than disputing any\nparticular findings, charging party states that “MERC’s factual finding that Article X [of the\nCBA, which is the provision that describes the bid-bump procedure] constitutes an unenforceable\n‘prohibited subject’ is not supported by any evidence in the record and therefore should be\nreversed.” Although styled as a challenge to MERC’s factual findings, this is essentially an\nargument that MERC’s legal interpretation of § 15(3)(j) is incorrect. As noted above, that\nposition is without merit.\n\n                                 B. EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\n       We also find that MERC did not abuse its discretion when it declined to hold an\nevidentiary hearing. There have never been any disputed factual issues in this case and all facts\n\n\n5\n  To the extent charging party proffers a public policy argument, it offers no reason why its\nvague assertion to public policy should overcome the plain language of the statute.\n6\n The use of the term “may” denotes discretion. See In re Estate of Weber, 257 Mich App 558,\n562; 669 NW2d 288 (2003).\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\falleged by charging party were accepted as true. The only salient issue in this case was and\ncontinues to be an issue of law, i.e., whether the newly-amended § 15(3)(j) applied and\nprohibited the bid-bump procedure at issue in this case. Once again, we find that charging\nparty’s argument is essentially a challenge to the pertinent legal issue in this case, not to any\nfactual issue. MERC did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.\nSee Sault Ste Marie Area Pub Schs, 213 Mich App at 182 (explaining that “[i]n the absence of a\nfactual dispute, the MERC did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary\nhearing.”).\n\n                                   C. ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n        Lastly, charging party argues that MERC erred by declining to hold oral argument.\nCharging party was granted oral argument before the ALJ; however, MERC denied charging\nparty’s request for further argument when it decided charging party’s exceptions to the ALJ’s\nrecommended decision and order. In Smith v Lansing Sch Dist, 428 Mich 248, 250, 259-260;\n406 NW2d 825 (1987), our Supreme Court reversed a MERC decision where the charging\nparties were not given an opportunity to present oral argument. In that case, the hearing referee\nsua sponte issued a decision recommending that MERC summarily dismiss the unfair labor\npractice charge. Id. at 251-252. The charging parties filed an exception with MERC, which\ndenied the unfair labor practice charge without holding either a hearing7 or oral argument. The\nCourt held that the failure to afford the charging parties oral argument required remand. Id. In\ndoing so, the Court examined MCL 423.216(a), which provides that in the event of an unfair\nlabor practice charge under PERA, “the commission, or any agent designated by the commission\nfor such purposes, may issue and cause to be served upon the person a complaint stating . . . and\ncontaining a notice of hearing before the commission or a commissioner thereof, or before a\ndesignated agent . . . .” Smith, 428 Mich at 254, quoting MCL 423.216(a) (Emphasis added).\nThe Court also noted that MCL 423.216(a) provided, as it does now, that “[a]ny proceeding”\nunder § 16(a) “shall be conducted pursuant to” sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan\nAdministrative Procedures Act. Id. See also MCL 423.216(a). Pertinent to the issue of oral\nargument, the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act provides that, in a contested case, “[t]he\nparties shall be given an opportunity to present oral and written arguments on issues of law and\npolicy and an opportunity to present evidence and argument on issues of fact.” MCL 24.272(3).\nSee also Smith, 428 Mich at 259. Because the charging parties in Smith were never afforded the\nopportunity to present oral arguments, the Court remanded the case to MERC for further\nproceedings and to afford the charging parties an opportunity to present oral argument. Id. at\n259-260.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  The Court in Smith, 428 Mich at 251, held that conducting an evidentiary hearing in that case\nwas unnecessary because “all alleged facts of the charging party are to be taken as true” when\nsummarily dismissing a case. Here, as noted, all of the facts alleged by charging party were\ntaken as true and there were no disputed issues of fact. Thus, no evidentiary hearing was\nrequired. Id.\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f        We note that the issue in Smith was not the same as the issue raised in the instant case. In\nSmith, the charging party was never afforded oral argument. Here, charging party was afforded\noral argument before the ALJ, but not before MERC. Proceedings before MERC are first\ngenerally held before a referee or ALJ or other MERC designee, pursuant to MCL 423.216(a).\nSee, generally, Detroit v Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, Local 3434, IAFF, 204 Mich App 541,\n554-555; 517 NW2d 240 (1994). If a party takes exception to the recommended decision and\norder, then the matter proceeds before “the commission,” i.e., MERC, pursuant to the procedure\nset forth in MCL 423.216(b). See North Dearborn Hts Federation of Teachers v North\nDearborn Hts Sch Dist, 382 Mich 105, 107; 168 NW2d 219 (1969). In pertinent part, MCL\n423.216(b) provides that:\n\n       The testimony taken by the commissioner, agent, or the commission shall be\n       reduced to writing and filed with the commission. Thereafter the commission\n       upon notice may take further testimony or hear argument.\n\nAs our Supreme Court stated in North Dearborn Hts, 382 Mich at 107, the above requirement “is\nobviously for the reason that such a provision is to cover the situation . . . where the entire board\ndoes not hear the matter itself, but permits a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing, and then\nacts as a reviewing body of the examiner’s report and recommended order.” Significant to the\ncase at bar, § 16(b), unlike § 16(a), does not require MERC to grant oral argument, but instead\ngives MERC discretion. Indeed, § 16(b) states that after testimony is taken by the ALJ or MERC\n[acting in the same capacity as an ALJ] in an earlier proceeding, MERC “upon notice may take\nfurther testimony or hear argument.”).8 Accordingly, while oral argument is required under\n§ 16(a), it is not mandated by § 16(b).\n\n        Additionally, we note MERC’s administrative rules related to hearings before an ALJ and\nto those before MERC. As the Court recognized in Smith, 428 Mich at 255, MERC has authority\nto promulgate its own rules. Mich Admin Code R 423.173 provides that, at the close of a\nhearing before an ALJ, “[a] party is entitled upon request to a reasonable period at the close of\nthe hearing for oral argument, which shall be made part of the record.” (Emphasis added). Thus,\nin accordance with Smith and MCL 423.216(a), a party is entitled to oral argument before the\nALJ. With regard to proceedings before MERC after a matter has already been heard by an ALJ\nor other designee of MERC, Mich Admin Code R 423.178 provides as follows:\n\n       If a party desires to argue orally before the commission, a written request shall\n       accompany the exceptions, cross exceptions, or the brief in support of the decision\n       and recommended order, and at the same time, the request shall be served on all\n       other parties. The request must indicate “oral argument requested” in bold capital\n       letters on the first page of the pleading under the caption. The commission, on its\n       own motion, may also direct oral argument. The commission shall notify the\n\n\n\n8\n  “In general, the disjunctive term ‘or’ refers to a choice or alternative between two or more\nthings[.]” AFSCME Council 25 v Wayne Co, 292 Mich App 68, 92-93; 811 NW2d 4 (2011)\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\f       parties of the time and place of oral argument. The commission may limit the\n       time for oral argument by each party.\n\nUnlike a hearing before an ALJ, Rule 423.178 does not mandate oral argument; rather, it simply\nstates that a party may request oral argument. The idea that a party is to request oral argument\nsuggests that MERC has discretion whether to grant oral argument at this stage. In addition, the\nrule does not require or guarantee oral argument.\n\n        Turning to the instant case, charging party’s citation to Smith is unavailing. Unlike in\nSmith, charging party was afforded oral argument before the ALJ. It was only denied oral\nargument before MERC. This was permitted under MCL 423.216(b) and Mich Admin Code R\n423.178. Consistent with Mich Admin Code R 423.178, the language employed in MCL\n423.216 indicates that MERC has discretion over whether to grant oral argument after the matter\nhas been heard by the ALJ. There is no merit to charging party’s contention that it is entitled to\nreversal because MERC found additional oral argument would be unnecessary to its review of\nthe case.9\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Deborah A. Servitto\n                                                            /s/ Jane M. Beckering\n                                                            /s/ Mark T. Boonstra\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Moreover, charging party fails to explain how additional oral argument would have made a\ndifference in this case, or what arguments it would have made had it been granted another round\nof oral argument.\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\f",

THE “BID-BUMP” PROCEDURE\n\n         This case primarily involves a matter of statutory interpretation and the pertinent facts are\nundisputed. Charging party and respondent are parties to a collective bargaining agreement\n(CBA) that expired on or about August 25, 2011. The expired CBA contained sections that\ndescribed, among other matters, a procedure for the assignment of vacant teaching positions.\nThe CBA called for a meeting, referred to by the parties as a “bid-bump” meeting or “teacher\nassignment meeting” that was to take place near the end of the school year, in either April, May,\nor June. For the sake of simplicity, the purpose of the “bid-bump” meeting, as set forth in the\nnow-expired CBA, was to permit teachers to bid on open positions, based on a number of\ncriteria. According to charging party, it had utilized the bid-bump procedure for approximately\n27 years.\n\n                                      B. MCL 423.215(3)(j)\n\n       The Public Employee Relations Act (PERA), MCL 423.201 et seq., establishes, among\nother matters, the duties of public employers and public employees with regard to collective\nbargaining. MCL 423.215(3) sets forth prohibited subjects of bargaining between a public\nschool employer and the bargaining representative of its employees. The matters described as\n“prohibited subjects of bargaining “are within the sole authority of the public school employer to\n\n                                                 -1-\n\fdecide.” MCL 423.215(4). Historically, PERA did not include decisions regarding the\nplacement of teachers among the prohibited subjects of bargaining. In 2011, the Legislature\nenacted a series of amendments to PERA and expanded the list of prohibited subjects of\nbargaining between public school employers and employees. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which became\neffective July 19, 2011, added several prohibited subjects, including as set forth in MCL\n423.215(3)(j). MCL 423.215(3)(j) prohibits bargaining with regard to:\n\n       Any decision made by the public school employer regarding teacher placement, or\n       the impact of that decision on an individual employee or the bargaining unit.1\n\n                          C. UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE CHARGE\n\n        In the spring of 2012, respondent did not hold the bid-bump meeting despite three\nrequests by charging party. Charging party filed an unfair labor practice charge in July 2012,\nciting the failure to hold a bid-bump meeting as set forth in the CBA.2 In response, respondent\nargued that the enactment of MCL 423.215(3)(j) removed any duty to bargain over teacher-\nplacement decisions and gave it unilateral authority to make decisions relating to teacher\nplacement. According to respondent, it was no longer required to employ the bid-bump\nprocedure described in the now-expired CBA. Following oral argument, the Administrative Law\nJudge (ALJ) agreed with respondent and issued a recommended decision and order dismissing\nthe unfair labor practice charge. Accepting as true the facts alleged by charging party, the ALJ\ndenied charging party’s request for an evidentiary hearing as it found that there were no disputed\nissues of fact. The ALJ also found that the language of § 15(3)(j) was clear and that it prohibited\nbargaining over any decision pertaining to teacher placement, including the bid-bump procedure.\n\n        Charging party filed exceptions to the ALJ’s recommended decision and order and\nrequested oral argument and an evidentiary hearing. In a written opinion and order, MERC\ndenied the request for oral argument and an evidentiary hearing, finding that neither would aid in\nits decision. MERC adopted the ALJ’s factual summary. As to the interpretation of § 15(j)(3),\nMERC rejected charging party’s exceptions and found that the ALJ did not err in its\n\n\n\n\n1\n   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> added §15(3)(j) to MCL 423.215, prohibiting as a subject of bargaining “Any\ndecision made by the public school employer regarding the placement of teachers, or the impact\nof that decision on an individual employee or the bargaining unit.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which became\neffective March 13, 2012, amended § 15(3)(j), changing the phrase “the placement of teachers”\nto the phrase “teacher placement.” The 2012 version was in effect at the time charging party\nfiled its claim of unfair labor practice in July 2012; that same version remains in effect today.\nSee MCL 423.215(3)(j).\n\n\n2\n  Although the CBA expired on August 25, 2011, charging party contended that during\nnegotiations for a successor collective bargaining agreement, respondent was required to\nmaintain the status quo with respect to mandatory subjects of bargaining.\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\finterpretation of the statute. MERC dismissed charging party’s unfair labor practice charge in its\nentirety. This appeal followed.\n\n                         II. INTERPRETATION OF MCL 423.215(3)(j)\n\n                                 A. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        Our review of MERC’s interpretation of MCL 423.215(3)(j) is de novo. Decatur Pub\nSchs v Van Buren Co Ed Ass’n, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket No. 320272, issued\nMarch 17, 2015), slip op at 5. However, we note that our Supreme Court has explained that “an\nagency’s interpretation of a statute is entitled to ‘respectful consideration,’ but courts may not\nabdicate their judicial responsibility to interpret statutes by giving unfettered deference to an\nagency’s interpretation. Courts must respect legislative decisions and interpret statutes according\nto their plain language.” In re Complaint of Rovas Against SBC Mich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93; 754\nNW2d 259 (2008). This standard requires “cogent reasons” for overruling an agency’s\ninterpretation.” Id. at 103. “However, the agency’s interpretation is not binding on the courts,\nand it cannot conflict with the Legislature’s intent as expressed in the language of the statute at\nissue.” Id.\n\n                         B. PERA AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING\n\n        “PERA governs the relationship between public employees and governmental agencies.”\nDecatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 5. The act imposes upon public employers a\nmandatory duty to bargain over certain subjects, such as “wages hours, and other terms and\nconditions of employment . . . .” MCL 423.215(1). See also Decatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at\n__, slip op at 6. While PERA requires bargaining on some subjects, § 15(3) sets forth subjects\nthat are prohibited from bargaining. See Mt Pleasant Pub Schs v Michigan AFSCME Council\n25, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608-609; 840 NW2d 750 (2013). “Except as otherwise provided in\nsubsection (3)(f),[3] the matters described in subsection (3) are prohibited subjects of bargaining\nbetween a public school employer and a bargaining representative of its employees, and, for the\npurposes of this act, are within the sole authority of the public school employer to decide.” MCL\n423.215(4). If there is no duty to bargain over the subject matter, the employer can take\nunilateral action. Decatur Pub Schs, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 10. This Court has explained\nthat, when the list of prohibited subjects of bargaining found in subsection 3 is read together with\nsubsection 4, the subsections “evince a legislative intent to make public school employers solely\nresponsible for these subjects by prohibiting them from being the subjects of enforceable\ncontract provisions and by eliminating any duty to bargain regarding them.” Michigan State\nAFL-CIO v Michigan Employment Relations Comm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1243617\"><a href=\"/opinion/1243617/michigan-state-afl-cio-v-mich-emp-relations-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

APPLICATION\n\n         Turning to the statute at issue, § 15(3)(j) provides that collective bargaining between a\npublic school employer and a bargaining representative of its employees “shall not include”\n“[a]ny decision made by the public school employer regarding teacher placement, or the impact\nof that decision on an individual employee or bargaining unit.” MCL 423.215(3)(j) (emphasis\nadded). The word “any” is not defined in the statute, but is commonly understood to be all-\nencompassing, meaning “every” or “all” and can be “used to indicate one selected without\nrestriction” or can be used “to indicate a maximum or whole.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary (11th ed). The word, “decision,” meanwhile, is defined to mean “the act or process\nof deciding.” Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (11th ed). The term “placement” as\nused in the statute is commonly understood to refer to “an act or instance of placing” or “the\nassignment of a person to a suitable place (as a job or a class in school).” Merriam-Webster’s\nCollegiate Dictionary (11th ed).\n\n        Given the broad language employed in § 15(3)(j), we find that the Legislature intended to\nprohibit an employer from bargaining over any decision, including policies or procedures such as\nthe bid-bump procedure, with regard to teacher placement. The plain language of the statute\ngives broad discretion to public school employers to make “[a]ny decision,” i.e., every, or all\ndecisions, “unmeasured or unlimited in amount, number or extent,” regarding or concerning\nteacher placement. The statute contains no limitations on the employer. Also, the statute refers\nto decisions, which include the act or process of deciding. By stating that there was no duty to\nbargain over “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher placement and providing no limitation or\nexplanation thereafter, the Legislature demonstrated its intent to afford public school employers\nbroad discretion over any type of teacher placement decision or the impact of that decision on\nindividual teachers or the bargaining unit as a whole. Cf. People v Cunningham, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n154-155; 852 NW2d 118 (2014) (reasoning that where the Legislature provided courts with the\n\n                                               -4-\n\fauthority to impose “any cost” in MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(ii) and thereafter specified with\nparticularity the costs that could be imposed, such language “suggests strongly that the\nLegislature did not intend MCL 769.1k(1)(b)(ii) to provide courts with the independent authority\nto impose ‘any cost.’ ”). In other words, the Legislature intended to remove from the ambit of\nbargaining any decision concerning the assignment or placement of teachers, and that any\ndecision-making about teacher placement or assignments is to be within the sole discretion of the\nemployer. The broad language used in the statute necessarily includes any decision-making\nprocess as well; consequently, policies and procedures used to make teacher placement decisions\nsuch as those at issue in the instant case undoubtedly fall within the broad reach of “any\ndecision” regarding teacher placement. Therefore, the plain language of § 15(3)(j) precludes\nbargaining over the bid-bump procedure, or any other procedure utilized in teacher placement.\n\n        With regard to charging party’s argument about placement policies and procedures, we\nfind that it would make little sense that a public school employer could be compelled to bargain\nabout an overarching placement plan or process, e.g., the bid-bump procedure previously\nemployed in the instant case, yet have no duty to bargain over the placement decisions that result\nfrom that plan. Indeed, the decision-making process or plan would be of little import if the\nemployer could simply make any decision it wanted about placement, regardless of the plan or\nprocedure. Also, such a result would be contrary to the broad language employed in the statute.\n“When construing a statute, a court should not abandon the cannons of common sense.” In re\nConsumers Energy, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket Nos. 314361; 316868, issued May\n28, 2015), slip op at 6 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, construing the statute in\nthe manner proposed by charging party is not appropriate.\n\n        Charging party argues that the phrase “teacher placement” limits the scope of an\nemployer’s decision-making to decisions involving individual teachers. This argument is not\nsupported by the text of the statute. The term “teacher placement” could equally refer to the\nplacement of a single teacher or to the act of placing multiple teachers, and charging party\nprovides no cogent argument as to why it should be limited to a single teacher. To read the\nstatute in the manner proposed by charging party would essentially require this Court to read the\nstatute as applying to “[a]ny decision” applying to individual teachers regarding specific\nassignments, when the Legislature did not see fit to include such language in the statute. This\nCourt cannot do so. Mich Ed Ass'n v Secretary of State (On Rehearing), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 217; 801\nNW2d 35 (2011) (“nothing may be read into a statute that is not within the manifest intent of the\nLegislature as derived from the act itself.”) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Furthermore,\ncharging party’s attempt to segregate the phrase “teacher placement” from the rest of the\nlanguage employed in § 15(3)(j) is an inappropriate way to assess the intent of the Legislature.\nSee Speicher, 497 Mich at 138 (“An attempt to segregate any portion or exclude any portion of a\nstatute from consideration is almost certain to distort legislative intent.”). Rather, the phrase\nmust be construed in context. When viewed in context, the phrase “teacher placement” is\nintended to refer to the placement of an individual teacher or to the placement of multiple\nteachers. As noted, the phrase “teacher placement” follows the phrase “[a]ny decision.” To\nconstrue the phrase “teacher placement” as applying to only those decisions made about\nindividual teachers would significantly limit and undermine the broad, encompassing phrase,\n“[a]ny decision” used by the Legislature. In addition, § 15(3)(j) provides, in pertinent part, that\nthere is no duty to bargain over teacher placement, “or the impact of that decision on an\nindividual employee or the bargaining unit.” (Emphasis added). This language does not suggest\n\n                                                -5-\n\fthat “teacher placement” is meant to refer only to decisions about specific teachers, as it invokes\nthe “bargaining unit” as a whole, as well as individual teachers.\n\n        Charging party argues that reading MCL 423.215 in context compels the conclusion that\nits interpretation of the statute is correct. It notes that several other prohibited subjects of\nbargaining in § 15 exclude from bargaining decisions “about the development, content,\nstandards, procedures, adoption, and implementation” of the public school employer’s policies\nand procedures in certain areas. See MCL 423.215(3)(k) (providing that a public school\nemployer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to “[d]ecisions about the development,\ncontent, standards, procedures, adoption, and implementation of the public school employer's\npolicies regarding personnel decisions when conducting a staffing or program reduction or any\nother personnel determination resulting in the elimination of a position . . . .”); MCL\n423.215(3)(l) (a public school employer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to\n“[d]ecisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and\nimplementation of a public school employer's performance evaluation system . . . .); MCL\n423.215(3)(m) (a public school employer does not have a duty to bargain with regard to\n“decisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and implementation\nof a policy regarding discharge or discipline of an employee, decisions concerning the discharge\nor discipline of an individual employee, or the impact of those decisions on an individual\nemployee or the bargaining unit.”); MCL 423.215(3)(o) (a public school employer does not have\na duty to bargain about “[d]ecisions about the development, format, content, and procedures of\nthe notification to parents and legal guardians required under [MCL 380.1249a]” regarding\nteachers who have been rated as “ineffective.”). Charging party’s argument is unavailing. As\nnoted, the plain language of § 15(3)(j) provides broad, unilateral discretion to the public school\nemployer with regard to “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher placement. Charging party’s\nproposed construction would be inconsistent with that language. And, it would make little sense\nto give an employer this broad authority yet require the employer to bargain over an overarching\npolicy regarding teacher placement, particularly a policy such as the bid-bump policy employed\nin the instant case wherein teachers had authority over placement and transfer decisions.\n\n        Charging party also argues that an earlier draft of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">2013</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> compels this Court to\ninterpret § 15(3)(j) in the manner it proposes. Courts may consider legislative history, including\n“the changes in the bill during its passage.” Dep’t of Transp v Thrasher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1850703\"><a href=\"/opinion/1850703/trans-dept-v-thrasher/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

App.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70; 748 NW2d 244 (2008). Here, charging party notes that as initially proposed by the\nHouse, § 15(3)(j) provided:\n\n       (j) Decisions about the development, content, standards, procedures, adoption,\n       and implementation of the public school employer’s policy for placement of\n       teachers required under section 1247 of the revised school code, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n       MCL 380.1247,[4] any decision made by the public school employer pursuant to\n\n\n4\n MCL 380.1247 was repealed by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, effective July 1, 1996. In pertinent part, MCL\n380.1247(c) provided that “an administrator or administrators, usually called a building\nprincipal,” “shall” among others, “[s]ubmit recommendations to the superintendent for the\n\n                                                -6-\n\f       that policy, or the impact of those decisions on an individual employee or the\n       bargaining unit. [2011 HB 4628.]\n\nCharging party finds significant the initial inclusion, but subsequent rejection, of language\npertaining to decisions about the “development, content, standards, procedures, adoption, and\nimplementation of the public school employer’s policy for placement of teachers . . . .” Charging\nparty argues that 2011 HB 4628 demonstrates that the Legislature initially considered including\namong the lists of prohibited subjects of bargaining a public school employer’s decisions about\nprocedures and standards used in teacher placement decisions, but declined to adopt such a broad\npolicy. Instead, according to charging party, the Legislature elected to use the phrase “[a]ny\ndecision,” which charging party contends is not as broad in its scope as the language that was\ninitially proposed in 2011 HB 4628, but subsequently rejected.\n\n        Charging party’s citation to 2011 HB 4628 is unavailing. The plain language of\n§ 15(3)(j) is clear that it applies, without limitation, to “[a]ny decision” regarding teacher\nplacement. That the Legislature considered adding to the statute language pertaining to decisions\nabout policies and procedures for the placement of teachers and any decision pursuant to those\npolicies is of little consequence, given the broad prohibition that was eventually passed. Indeed,\nwe find the language that the Legislature eventually adopted in § 15(3)(j) is broader in scope\nthan the language proposed in 2011 HB 4628, as it applies to “[a]ny decision,” without\nlimitation. Decisions about policies and procedures regarding teacher placement would\nnecessarily fall within the ambit of “[a]ny decision” about teacher placement. We will not resort\nto legislative history to “cloud a statutory text that is clear.” In re Certified Question (Kenneth\nHenes Special Projects Procurement v Continental Biomass Indus, Inc), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113; 659\nNW2d 597 (2003) (citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n        In sum, we find that the plain meaning of § 15(3)(j) demonstrates the intent of the\nLegislature to give public school employers discretion regarding a broad spectrum of teacher\nplacement decisions. This broad discretion applies not only to placement decisions themselves,\nbut also to any decision the employer makes in regard to how it decides to go about making those\ndecisions. Any decision regarding teacher placement, which is a prohibited subject of\nbargaining, cannot be the subject of a collective-bargaining agreement. See Baumgartner v\nPerry Pub Schs, __ Mich App __; __ NW2d __ (Docket Nos. 313945; 314158; 314696), slip op\nat 11 (interpreting MCL 423.215(3)(k), which provides that decisions about a school employer’s\npersonnel decisions are prohibited subjects of bargaining). There are no cogent reasons for\noverturning MERC’s interpretation of this statute. See In re Complaint of Rovas 482 Mich at\n103.\n\n       Charging party argues that MERC’s (and the ALJ’s) interpretation of the statute, with\nwhich we agree, is a “broad construction” of § 15(3)(j), and charging party encourages this Court\nto adopt a narrower construction. Contrary to charging party’s contentions, such interpretation\n\nappointment, assignment, promotion, or dismissal of personnel assigned to supervision of the\nadministrator.” Legislative history reveals that the Legislature contemplated bringing back and\naltering the now-defunct MCL 380.1247 at the time it considered the passage of 2011 HB 4628.\nSee House Legislative Analysis, HB 4625-4628, May 10, 2011.\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fof the statute does not constitute a broad construction; rather, it constitutes an interpretation of\nthe statute as it is written. As written, the statute is broad in its scope and application. We must\nadhere to the plain language of the statute and the intent of the Legislature as expressed plainly\ntherein. Our role is to interpret the law and to apply statutes as they are written, not to question\nthe Legislature or to alter plain statutory language.5 See Johnson v Recca, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 187;\n821 NW2d 520 (2012).\n\n                               III. REMAINING CHALLENGES\n\n        Charging party next raises issues concerning MERC’s factual findings, its failure to hold\nan evidentiary hearing, and its failure to permit additional oral argument. MERC’s factual\nfindings are conclusive “if they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence\non the record considered as a whole.” Van Buren Co Ed Ass’n, __ Mich App at __, slip op at 5.\n“This evidentiary standard is equal to the amount of evidence that a reasonable mind would\naccept as sufficient to support a conclusion. While it consists of more than a scintilla of\nevidence, it may be substantially less than a preponderance.” Mt Pleasant Pub Schs, 302 Mich\nApp at 615 (citation and quotation marks omitted). With regard to charging party’s argument\nthat MERC erred by failing to hold oral argument or an evidentiary hearing, our review is for an\nabuse of discretion. See MCL 423.216(b) (explaining that MERC “may”6 take further testimony\nor “hear argument” after the hearing before the ALJ); Sault Ste Marie Area Pub Schs v Mich Ed\nAss’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2219524\"><a href=\"/opinion/2219524/sault-ste-marie-schs-v-michigan-education-assoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182; 539 NW2d 565 (1995).\n\n                              A. MERC’S FACTUAL FINDINGS\n\n        Charging party first contests the sufficiency of MERC’s factual findings, arguing that\nthose findings failed to accurately describe the bid-bump procedure. In evaluating this issue, we\nnote that both the ALJ and MERC accepted as true the facts alleged by charging party and that\nthey both described the facts in this case as being undisputed. Rather than disputing any\nparticular findings, charging party states that “MERC’s factual finding that Article X [of the\nCBA, which is the provision that describes the bid-bump procedure] constitutes an unenforceable\n‘prohibited subject’ is not supported by any evidence in the record and therefore should be\nreversed.” Although styled as a challenge to MERC’s factual findings, this is essentially an\nargument that MERC’s legal interpretation of § 15(3)(j) is incorrect. As noted above, that\nposition is without merit.\n\n                                 B. EVIDENTIARY HEARING\n\n       We also find that MERC did not abuse its discretion when it declined to hold an\nevidentiary hearing. There have never been any disputed factual issues in this case and all facts\n\n\n5\n  To the extent charging party proffers a public policy argument, it offers no reason why its\nvague assertion to public policy should overcome the plain language of the statute.\n6\n The use of the term “may” denotes discretion. See In re Estate of Weber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1303900\"><a href=\"/opinion/1303900/in-re-weber-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n562; 669 NW2d 288 (2003).\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\falleged by charging party were accepted as true. The only salient issue in this case was and\ncontinues to be an issue of law, i.e., whether the newly-amended § 15(3)(j) applied and\nprohibited the bid-bump procedure at issue in this case. Once again, we find that charging\nparty’s argument is essentially a challenge to the pertinent legal issue in this case, not to any\nfactual issue. MERC did not abuse its discretion by declining to hold an evidentiary hearing.\nSee Sault Ste Marie Area Pub Schs, 213 Mich App at 182 (explaining that “[i]n the absence of a\nfactual dispute, the MERC did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary\nhearing.”).\n\n                                   C. ORAL ARGUMENT\n\n        Lastly, charging party argues that MERC erred by declining to hold oral argument.\nCharging party was granted oral argument before the ALJ; however, MERC denied charging\nparty’s request for further argument when it decided charging party’s exceptions to the ALJ’s\nrecommended decision and order. In Smith v Lansing Sch Dist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2213513\"><a href=\"/opinion/2213513/smith-v-lansing-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250, 259-260;\n406 NW2d 825 (1987), our Supreme Court reversed a MERC decision where the charging\nparties were not given an opportunity to present oral argument. In that case, the hearing referee\nsua sponte issued a decision recommending that MERC summarily dismiss the unfair labor\npractice charge. Id. at 251-252. The charging parties filed an exception with MERC, which\ndenied the unfair labor practice charge without holding either a hearing7 or oral argument. The\nCourt held that the failure to afford the charging parties oral argument required remand. Id. In\ndoing so, the Court examined MCL 423.216(a), which provides that in the event of an unfair\nlabor practice charge under PERA, “the commission, or any agent designated by the commission\nfor such purposes, may issue and cause to be served upon the person a complaint stating . . . and\ncontaining a notice of hearing before the commission or a commissioner thereof, or before a\ndesignated agent . . . .” Smith, 428 Mich at 254, quoting MCL 423.216(a) (Emphasis added).\nThe Court also noted that MCL 423.216(a) provided, as it does now, that “[a]ny proceeding”\nunder § 16(a) “shall be conducted pursuant to” sections 24.271 to 24.287 of the Michigan\nAdministrative Procedures Act. Id. See also MCL 423.216(a). Pertinent to the issue of oral\nargument, the Michigan Administrative Procedures Act provides that, in a contested case, “[t]he\nparties shall be given an opportunity to present oral and written arguments on issues of law and\npolicy and an opportunity to present evidence and argument on issues of fact.” MCL 24.272(3).\nSee also Smith, 428 Mich at 259. Because the charging parties in Smith were never afforded the\nopportunity to present oral arguments, the Court remanded the case to MERC for further\nproceedings and to afford the charging parties an opportunity to present oral argument. Id. at\n259-260.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  The Court in Smith, 428 Mich at 251, held that conducting an evidentiary hearing in that case\nwas unnecessary because “all alleged facts of the charging party are to be taken as true” when\nsummarily dismissing a case. Here, as noted, all of the facts alleged by charging party were\ntaken as true and there were no disputed issues of fact. Thus, no evidentiary hearing was\nrequired. Id.\n\n\n                                               -9-\n\f        We note that the issue in Smith was not the same as the issue raised in the instant case. In\nSmith, the charging party was never afforded oral argument. Here, charging party was afforded\noral argument before the ALJ, but not before MERC. Proceedings before MERC are first\ngenerally held before a referee or ALJ or other MERC designee, pursuant to MCL 423.216(a).\nSee, generally, Detroit v Detroit Fire Fighters Ass’n, Local 3434, IAFF, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1312165\"><a href=\"/opinion/1312165/city-of-detroit-v-detroit-fire-fighters-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n554-555; 517 NW2d 240 (1994). If a party takes exception to the recommended decision and\norder, then the matter proceeds before “the commission,” i.e., MERC, pursuant to the procedure\nset forth in MCL 423.216(b). See North Dearborn Hts Federation of Teachers v North\nDearborn Hts Sch Dist, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107; 168 NW2d 219 (1969). In pertinent part, MCL\n423.216(b) provides that:\n\n       The testimony taken by the commissioner, agent, or the commission shall be\n       reduced to writing and filed with the commission. Thereafter the commission\n       upon notice may take further testimony or hear argument.\n\nAs our Supreme Court stated in North Dearborn Hts, 382 Mich at 107, the above requirement “is\nobviously for the reason that such a provision is to cover the situation . . . where the entire board\ndoes not hear the matter itself, but permits a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing, and then\nacts as a reviewing body of the examiner’s report and recommended order.” Significant to the\ncase at bar, § 16(b), unlike § 16(a), does not require MERC to grant oral argument, but instead\ngives MERC discretion. Indeed, § 16(b) states that after testimony is taken by the ALJ or MERC\n[acting in the same capacity as an ALJ] in an earlier proceeding, MERC “upon notice may take\nfurther testimony or hear argument.”).8 Accordingly, while oral argument is required under\n§ 16(a), it is not mandated by § 16(b).\n\n        Additionally, we note MERC’s administrative rules related to hearings before an ALJ and\nto those before MERC. As the Court recognized in Smith, 428 Mich at 255, MERC has authority\nto promulgate its own rules. Mich Admin Code R 423.173 provides that, at the close of a\nhearing before an ALJ, “[a] party is entitled upon request to a reasonable period at the close of\nthe hearing for oral argument, which shall be made part of the record.” (Emphasis added). Thus,\nin accordance with Smith and MCL 423.216(a), a party is entitled to oral argument before the\nALJ. With regard to proceedings before MERC after a matter has already been heard by an ALJ\nor other designee of MERC, Mich Admin Code R 423.178 provides as follows:\n\n       If a party desires to argue orally before the commission, a written request shall\n       accompany the exceptions, cross exceptions, or the brief in support of the decision\n       and recommended order, and at the same time, the request shall be served on all\n       other parties. The request must indicate “oral argument requested” in bold capital\n       letters on the first page of the pleading under the caption. The commission, on its\n       own motion, may also direct oral argument. The commission shall notify the\n\n\n\n8\n  “In general, the disjunctive term ‘or’ refers to a choice or alternative between two or more\nthings[.]” AFSCME Council 25 v Wayne Co, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

The commission may limit the\n       time for oral argument by each party.\n\nUnlike a hearing before an ALJ, Rule 423.178 does not mandate oral argument; rather, it simply\nstates that a party may request oral argument. The idea that a party is to request oral argument\nsuggests that MERC has discretion whether to grant oral argument at this stage. In addition, the\nrule does not require or guarantee oral argument.\n\n        Turning to the instant case, charging party’s citation to Smith is unavailing. Unlike in\nSmith, charging party was afforded oral argument before the ALJ. It was only denied oral\nargument before MERC. This was permitted under MCL 423.216(b) and Mich Admin Code R\n423.178. Consistent with Mich Admin Code R 423.178, the language employed in MCL\n423.216 indicates that MERC has discretion over whether to grant oral argument after the matter\nhas been heard by the ALJ. There is no merit to charging party’s contention that it is entitled to\nreversal because MERC found additional oral argument would be unnecessary to its review of\nthe case.9\n\n       Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                                            /s/ Deborah A. Servitto\n                                                            /s/ Jane M. Beckering\n                                                            /s/ Mark T. Boonstra\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Moreover, charging party fails to explain how additional oral argument would have made a\ndifference in this case, or what arguments it would have made had it been granted another round\nof oral argument.\n\n\n                                              -11-\n\f</pre>",
