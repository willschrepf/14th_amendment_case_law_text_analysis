extraordinary\r\nopportunity to clarify legal sufficiency reviews (as well as other issues) in\r\ncivil cases in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            What makes this case unique is that we\r\nare presented with a witness’s testimony that used both a label and a\r\ndescription of a transaction.  The witness described the transaction and the\r\nsurrounding circumstances.  The witness also testified that the transaction was\r\nnot a “loan” and that it was a “gift.”  The question upon which this appeal\r\nturns is whether, and under what circumstances, the label used by a witness\r\nwill control over and above the witness’s description of the transaction.  I\r\nbelieve the Court errs in giving conclusive effect to the witness’s use of one\r\nlabel and ignoring the description of the transaction in that analysis, and\r\nthen rejecting the same witness’s use of another label in deference to her\r\ntestimony about the description of the transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This appeal also presents the\r\nopportunity to clarify the appellee’s burden on appeal.  The issue is what must\r\nan appellee do to prevail on appeal if, as the defendant in the trial court,\r\nthe appellee won a take nothing judgment.  The confusion comes from the oft\r\ncited phrase describing the standard of review that where findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law are not available, as in this appeal, the appellate court\r\nmust affirm the judgment on any theory finding “support” in the record.  <i>In\r\nInterest of W.E.R</i>., 669 S.W.2d 716, 717 (Tex. 1984).  I believe this\r\nstandard of review is being inverted in this appeal to put a burden on the <i>appellee,\r\n</i>rather than the <i>appellant</i>.  The Court is requiring the <i>appellee</i>\r\nto show that there is no theory, whether raised at trial by the plaintiff or\r\nnot, under which a judgment for the plaintiff is proper.  In this regard, the Court\r\nerrs.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            I respectfully dissent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Procedural History</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose Lopez sued his former\r\nsister-in-law, Amy Lopez, for the conversion of a receipt or $15,000.  Jose\r\nfailed to convince the trial court, acting as the factfinder, that Amy had\r\nconverted either the receipt or cash.  The trial court, instead, opined that based\r\non the evidence the transaction was a loan and that because the loan was not in\r\nwriting, the recovery was barred by the statute of frauds.  Thus, the trial\r\ncourt rendered a take nothing judgment.  Jose appealed.  The evidence was both\r\nlegally and factually sufficient to “support” the trial court’s refusal to find\r\na conversion; therefore, the trial court did not err in rendering a take\r\nnothing judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose’s brother, Wenceslao Lopez, who\r\nat the time was also Amy’s husband, was being held by the INS (the United\r\nStates Immigration and Naturalization Service).  A $15,000 bond<sup><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></sup> was required for his release.  Amy and\r\nWenceslao did not have the money.  Ultimately, Jose handed Amy $15,000 in cash\r\nand, according to Amy, said, “let’s go get my brother.”  They rode together to San Antonio where Wenceslao was being held.  Because Jose had concerns about the INS also\r\ndetaining him, he had Amy attempt to deliver the cash to the INS.  The INS\r\nwould not accept cash.  A cashier’s check, rather than cash, was needed.  Jose\r\nwent to a bank he used and converted the cash to a cashier’s check and gave it\r\nto Amy.  Amy posted the bond using the cashier’s check and obtained a receipt\r\nin her name.  The receipt allowed the person who posted the bond to be paid the\r\namount of the bond once the INS case against Wenceslao had concluded.  In the\r\nfinal analysis, it is the proof, or lack thereof, to show the characterization\r\nof the legal nature of the foregoing described events that should control the\r\nresult of this appeal. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The next year, Amy and Wenceslao were\r\ngoing through a divorce.  Wenceslao attempted to get Amy to sign what she\r\nassumed was the paperwork to let Jose collect the bond money.  Amy refused\r\nunless her husband would drop his claim for custody of the children.  He would\r\nnot.  The disposition and/or ownership of this money was discussed during a\r\nmediation of the property division during the divorce.  It was not, however,\r\nspecifically dealt with in the divorce decree; but the decree awarded to Amy\r\nall the money in her possession and control.<sup><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></sup> \r\nAmy later asked her divorce lawyer what she should do with the money.  She was\r\nadvised that the money was hers.  About six months after the divorce, Amy sent\r\nthe necessary paperwork to the INS, which sent her a check for $15,000.  Amy\r\nspent the money on bills and private school tuition for at least one of her\r\nchildren.<sup><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            An issue about the money did not arise\r\nagain until Jose filed a motion to show cause in San Antonio.  The case was\r\ntransferred to McLennan County where Jose filed a petition for a constructive\r\ntrust.  Although Jose pled only for a constructive trust, the theory of\r\nconversion was tried to the court by consent.  The trial court rendered a take\r\nnothing judgment.  No findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed.<sup><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Sufficiency of the\r\nEvidence</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This was a non-jury trial, in which no\r\nfindings of fact or conclusions of law were filed; therefore, it is implied\r\nthat the trial court made all the necessary findings, if any, to support its\r\njudgment.  <i>Roberson v. Robinson</i>, 768 S.W.2d 280, 281 (Tex. 1989); <i>Goodyear\r\nTire and Rubber Co. v. Jefferson Constr. Co</i>., 565 S.W.2d 916, 918 (Tex. 1978).  When a reporter’s record is brought forward, as in this case, these implied\r\nfindings may be challenged by factual sufficiency and legal sufficiency points\r\nthe same as jury findings or a trial court's findings of fact.  <i>Roberson</i>,\r\n768 S.W.2d at 281; <i>Burnett v. Motyka</i>, 610 S.W.2d 735, 736 (Tex. 1980).<sup><sup><span>[5]</span></sup></sup>  In the absence of findings,\r\nit is an appellant’s burden to show that the trial court’s judgment was not\r\nsupported by any legal theory raised by the evidence.  <i>Point Lookout West,\r\nInc. v. Whorton</i>, 742 S.W.2d 277, 278 (Tex. 1987).  Thus, in this appeal,\r\nJose has the burden to show that the trial court’s refusal to render judgment\r\nin his favor was not supported by the legal theory, conversion of the receipt\r\nor the money, raised by the evidence he presented and the theory on which the\r\njudgment was sought.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Further, we must be mindful that, to\r\nprevail on appeal, Jose must establish that the trial court’s implied <i>refusal</i>\r\nto find that Amy converted the receipt or the money, the facts necessary to\r\nrender judgment in his favor, was against the great weight and preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  <i>See</i> <i>Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis</i>, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001).  The factfinder, in this proceeding the trial court, may choose to believe\r\nsome, all, or none of a witness’s testimony if a reasonable juror could.  <i>See</i> <i>City</i><i> of Keller v. Wilson</i>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 819 (Tex. 2005).  In this\r\nregard, Jose’s credibility was impeached by a felony conviction for criminal\r\nconspiracy involving forging documents.  Because it was Jose’s burden to prove\r\nhis case by a preponderance of the evidence, the factfinder does not have to\r\nhave any evidence in support of a refusal to find in Jose’s favor.  A refusal\r\nto find in favor of the party with the burden of proof, Jose, means only that the\r\nevidence failed to rise to that level necessary to cause the factfinder to\r\ndetermine more likely than not that Jose’s claim should be sustained on the\r\ntheory being presented.  <i>See</i> <i>Herbert v. Herbert</i>, 754 S.W.2d 141,\r\n145 (Tex. 1988).  If the trial court did not believe Jose’s testimony, he could\r\ndisregard it entirely.  The trial court’s statement that he thought the\r\ntransaction was a loan, which was directly contrary to Jose’s testimony,\r\nestablishes that the trial court did not find Jose a credible witness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><i><span>Conversion of Receipt </span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Conversion is the wrongful exercise of\r\ndominion and control over another's property in denial of or inconsistent with\r\nhis rights.  <i>Green Int'l v. Solis</i>, 951 S.W.2d 384, 391 (Tex. 1997); <i>Waisath v. Lack's Stores, Inc</i>., 474 S.W.2d 444, 446 (Tex. 1971).  The\r\nunauthorized and wrongful assumption and exercise of dominion and control over\r\nthe personal property of another, to the exclusion of or inconsistent with the\r\nowner's rights, is in law a conversion.  <i>Waisath</i>, 474 S.W.2d at 447.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose suggests that Amy’s refusal to\r\nsurrender the receipt or sign documents to allow him to be paid the money was\r\nconversion of the receipt as a matter of law.  He argues that these refusals\r\nshow that Amy exercised dominion and control over Jose’s personal property — the\r\nreceipt — to the exclusion of or inconsistent with his rights.  There was no\r\nshowing, however, that the receipt belonged to Jose.  Both Jose and Amy\r\ntestified that the receipt from the INS was in Amy’s name because she was the\r\none who delivered the cashier’s check to the INS for her husband’s bond.  When\r\nasked if he ever requested the receipt from Amy, Jose responded that he asked\r\nher to either get the money and give it to him, or sign the papers necessary\r\nfor him to be paid the money.  He did not say that he asked her for the\r\nreceipt.  And to the extent a request for the receipt could be inferred, there\r\nwas no showing that at that time Amy was still in possession of it so that she\r\nwould have been exercising dominion and control over it to the exclusion of\r\nanyone.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Reviewing the record under the\r\nappropriate standards of review, the trial court’s refusal to find a conversion\r\nof the receipt was not against the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence, and conversion of the receipt was not established as a matter of law.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><i><span>Conversion of $15,000</span></i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose also argues that Amy’s refusal to\r\nsurrender the actual money was a conversion of money.  An action for the\r\nconversion of money may be brought where money is (1) delivered for safe\r\nkeeping; (2) intended to be kept segregated; (3) substantially in the form in\r\nwhich it is received or an intact fund; and (4) not the subject of a title\r\nclaim by the keeper.  <i>Houston Nat'l Bank v. Biber</i>, 613 S.W.2d 771,\r\n774-75 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1981, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <i>see</i> <i>Southwest\r\nIndustries Inv. Co. v. Berkeley House Investors</i>, 695 S.W.2d 615, 617 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose contends that the money was\r\ndelivered through Amy to the INS for safekeeping and meets the other\r\nrequirements for an action for conversion.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span>  But\r\nthere is no evidence in the record that the money was a specifically\r\nidentifiable fund which Amy was supposed to segregate and later return as an\r\nintact fund.  Both Amy and Jose agreed that they had no discussions about\r\nwhether the money was a gift or a loan or about how the money was to be\r\nreturned to Jose, if at all.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Money is inherently fungible.  <i>See</i>\r\n  <i>Texas</i><i> Boll Weevil Eradication Found. v. Lewellen</i>, 952 S.W.2d\r\n454, 461 (Tex. 1997); <i>Dikes v. Springtown State Bank</i>, 84 S.W.2d 544, 545\r\n(Tex. App.—Ft. Worth 1935, writ dism’d).  There was evidence that Jose had been\r\nrepaid by Wenceslao before the divorce was final.  If Jose had been repaid by\r\nhis brother, not only does it show that there was not a segregated fund that\r\nneeded to remain intact, it shows that Amy had a claim to the funds as well.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Reviewing the record under the\r\nappropriate standards of review, the trial court’s refusal to find a conversion\r\nof the money was not against the great weight and preponderance of the\r\nevidence, and conversion of the money was not established as a matter of law.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[7]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose’s first two issues should be\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Statute of\r\nFrauds/Limitations</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In his third issue, Jose contends the\r\ntrial court erred in applying the statute of frauds or the statute of\r\nlimitations because those defenses were not affirmatively pled.  Specifically,\r\nhe complains that Amy’s supplemental answer raising the defenses was not timely\r\nfiled.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            There is nothing in the <i>judgment</i>\r\nthat indicates the trial court applied the statute of frauds or the statute of\r\nlimitations, and, as previously noted, no findings of fact or conclusions of\r\nlaw were filed.  The trial court did, however, state from the bench that “under\r\nmy analysis of this, I think your cause of action [for breach of a loan\r\nagreement] would be barred under the Statute of Frauds.”  But, oral comments\r\nfrom the bench are not written findings of fact.  <i>In re Jane Doe 10</i>, 78\r\nS.W.3d 338, 340 n.2 (Tex. 2002); <i>In the Interest of W.E.R</i>., 669 S.W.2d\r\n716, 716 (Tex. 1984).  Having no findings that the trial court applied the\r\nstatute of frauds or the statute of limitations, and based upon my disposition\r\nof the appeal on another ground, we would not need to decide Jose’s third\r\nissue.  Further, the statute of frauds defense is only applicable to the breach\r\nof a loan agreement, a theory Jose expressly disavowed, did not plead, and\r\nwhich he tried to avoid.<sup><sup><span>[8]</span></sup></sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Theories Not Argued/Burden\r\nof Proof</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Where the Court goes astray is\r\nreviewing theories <i>not</i> argued by Jose.  I have searched the briefs of\r\nboth parties and find no use of the term “bailment” or citation or argument of\r\nthis theory.  I do not recall it being part of the oral arguments made to the\r\nCourt.  It is a theory advanced by no one other than the Court in its opinion. \r\nI cannot hold that a trial court reversibly erred based on a conclusion made by\r\nthis Court on appeal that the evidence “points to” some other possible theory that\r\nwas never presented to the trial court or even to the appellate court by the\r\nparties.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            From my review of the proceedings, it\r\nseems pretty clear that the trial court determined that regardless of the legal\r\nmechanism under which the money was used by Jose’s brother, whether it was a\r\ngift, a loan<sup><sup><span>[9]</span></sup></sup>, or a\r\ntrust fund of some type, Jose failed to establish that he had not been repaid. \r\nIf the Court is going to point out other possible legal issues, like bailment,\r\nmaybe we should question why Jose did not make his brother a party.  After all,\r\nlike a loan, liability for the breach of the “bailment” will be a joint and\r\nseveral liability of the community estate; <i>i.e</i>. his brother will bear\r\nthe same liability as Amy.<sup><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The fundamental problem with relying\r\non theories not argued is that the Court has, I believe inadvertently, shifted\r\nthe burden on appeal to the party who did not have the burden of proof at trial\r\nand who has secured a take nothing judgment as a result of that trial.  When\r\nexamined closely, the Court’s opinion reveals that it is requiring the party\r\nwho was the defendant at trial, who won a take nothing judgment, to show that the\r\nfacts presented to the factfinder do not support any legal theory upon which a judgment\r\nfor the plaintiff could be based.  As an appellate court we should not shift\r\nthe burden on appeal to the prevailing party at trial to show on appeal that\r\nthere is no theory, including untried theories, which could support a judgment\r\nfor the plaintiff.  In this appeal, the Court holds that because bailment, a\r\ntheory argued by no one at trial or on appeal, might allow the otherwise\r\nunsuccessful plaintiff to prove a conversion of the bailed property, the case\r\nmust be remanded for a new trial.  I believe that is an erroneous placement of\r\nthe burden on appeal resulting in an improper reversal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Conclusive Testimony</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>(aka The Erroneous\r\nReliance on Labels)</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span> </span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            I began this opinion with expressing\r\nmy belief that this appeal presents an extraordinary opportunity to further\r\nclarify this Court’s method of conducting a sufficiency review.  I now return\r\nto that argument.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            What makes this the perfect\r\nopportunity to clarify the legal sufficiency review required under <i>City of\r\nKeller</i> is that the Court has determined what seems to be diametrically\r\nopposed rulings while parroting the <i>City of Keller</i> standard for such a\r\nreview.  The Court has held that by using the label “loan,” the witness, Amy,\r\nhas conclusively negated that the transaction was a loan by her testimony that\r\nit was not a loan.  The Court states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Amy’s testimony alone conclusively establishes\r\nthat the transaction was not a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            To the extent the trial court\r\nimpliedly found that Amy lawfully possessed the INS receipt or its $15,000 cash\r\nproceeds because Jose had loaned her the money, no evidence supports that\r\nimplied finding because a reasonable factfinder could not disregard Amy’s\r\ntestimony that the transaction was not a loan.  <i>See City of Keller</i>, 168 S.W.3d at 807.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Thus, the Court has concluded that by\r\nher testimony that the transaction <i>was not</i> a loan; a reasonable\r\nfactfinder could not have concluded it was a loan.  As additional support, the\r\nCourt references the testimony of Jose that the transaction was not a loan. \r\nBut remember, we are looking only for <i>some</i> evidence, legally sufficient\r\nevidence, that the transaction was, in fact, a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            I completely disagree that Amy’s\r\ntestimony “conclusively establishes that the transaction was not a loan.”  Even\r\nif I agreed, of what relevance to our review is this statement?  What does it\r\nmean?  Amy’s testimony using the label “loan” was only part of the evidence\r\nabout the transaction and her conclusory testimony, such as by the use of a\r\nlabel which has legal significance, is not conclusive proof of the fact to be\r\nestablished.  Further, other testimony conflicts with the “conclusive”\r\ntestimony that it was not a “loan.”  There was other testimony from which the\r\ncharacterization of the transaction as a loan would be proper.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[11]</span></span></span> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            But the intriguing analysis about the\r\nconclusive effect of using labels comes, not from another case, but from the\r\nvery same case, and not another witness, but from the very same witness.  Amy also\r\ntestified that the transaction <i>was</i> a “gift.”  With regard to this\r\ntestimony, the Court concludes that, notwithstanding her use of the label that\r\nthe transaction was a “gift,” a reasonable factfinder could not have concluded\r\nthat the transaction was a gift.  In this regard, the Court states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On cross-examination, Amy testified that Jose\r\nnever told her that the money was a gift.  She never expressed any thanks to\r\nJose for giving her the money, and she did not think the money was a gift until\r\nshe discovered that money was missing from her bank account during her\r\ndivorce.  Amy’s assumption that Jose gave her the money as a gift is not evidence\r\nof Jose’s donative intent.  Viewing Amy’s testimony about why and when she\r\ndetermined that the money was a gift in the light favorable to the trial\r\ncourt’s implied finding of a gift, a reasonable factfinder could not have\r\ncredited Amy’s testimony as evidence of a gift.  <i>See City of Keller</i>, 168 S.W.3d at 807.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>I disagree that the evidence conclusively proves\r\nthe transaction was not a gift.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            So, based upon Amy’s description of\r\nthe transaction, and comparing it to the labels to attempt to summarize her own\r\ntestimony and give a legal characterization to the transaction, the Court has told\r\nus that a reasonable factfinder could not have <i>rejected</i> her testimony\r\nthat it was not a “loan,” but could not have <i>believed</i> her testimony that\r\nit was a “gift.”  I find neither conclusion compelling because the Court is too\r\nfocused on the label applied to the transaction by the witness and not on an\r\nanalysis of what the testimony about the nature of the transaction would\r\nsupport.  But again, of what relevance is Amy’s failure to prove something on which\r\nshe did not have the burden of proof?  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In this regard, the Court states that\r\nthe testimony of Amy conclusively proves the transaction was not a loan.  But\r\nher testimony is internally inconsistent between the nature of the transaction\r\nand the label she sought to apply to it.  It reminds me of the old saying that\r\nif it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a\r\nduck – no matter what you call it.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[12]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            So will we review labels applied by\r\nparties who have an interest in characterizing the legal consequences of a\r\ntransaction?  Do we simply accept these conclusory statements, the label,\r\nwithout looking behind them to the true nature of the transaction as described\r\nby the witness?  I vote to reject considering only the witness’s use of a\r\nconclusory label and suggest that we must examine the true nature of the\r\ntransaction as testified to by all the witnesses.  We must consider the\r\ntotality of the evidence.  After all, this witness was not a lawyer and was not\r\nshown to know the difference between a loan, a gift, or a bailment.  Therefore,\r\nthe witness was not qualified to use a label that has now been given a\r\nconclusive legal meaning by this Court.  This is particularly true when the\r\nlegal label she used was in conflict with her other testimony about the nature\r\nof the transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Further, these were theories that were\r\nnot even being tried at the trial court level as such and that Amy, the trial\r\ncourt victor and as appellee, did not know she needed to brief or defend\r\nagainst on appeal.  Now the Court is not only remanding this proceeding for a\r\nnew trial but also is handcuffing the defendant by purporting to conclusively\r\ndecide on appeal theories that would have been improper even for the trial\r\ncourt to decide.  Thus, the Court is going to make the parties retry the case\r\nand prevent the parties, in particular the defendant/appellee, from being able\r\nto show the true nature of the events.  This is because the Court is deciding\r\nthat at least two theories, loan and gift, are conclusively negated by <i>this</i>\r\nrecord, <i>i.e.</i>, the above-described testimony applying the above-described\r\nstandard of review.  It appears irrelevant to the Court that other evidence may\r\nbe introduced at the next trial by the party who should have had no burden at\r\ntrial or on appeal which may clarify or explain the evidence presented in the\r\nearlier proceeding.  At the very least, if no theories are off limits on\r\nretrial, in essence that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply to any\r\nclaim or defense, we should clearly and unequivocally state that so the parties\r\nare not confused and resources needlessly consumed briefing and arguing the\r\nissue of what it is the Court intended by its judgment and opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Conclusion</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This was Jose’s case to win or lose. \r\nHe lost.  He did not convince the factfinder, the trial court, of the merits of\r\nhis chosen theory of recovery, conversion.  As an appellate court, we should\r\nnot select some other theory on which he might prevail if retried.  The trial\r\ncourt’s judgment should be affirmed.  Because it is not, I respectfully\r\ndissent.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

of the bond money, drafted the divorce decree.  If there\r\nwas a debt owed, it should have been listed as well.  This provides an\r\ninference that the debt had been paid by Wenceslao to his brother, Jose, and is\r\nsupported by the testimony of Amy.  Wenceslao was in the hall during trial but\r\nwas not called as a witness.  Amy certainly could not be expected to call him\r\nas a witness since he

extraordinary\r\nopportunity to clarify legal sufficiency reviews (as well as other issues) in\r\ncivil cases in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            What makes this case unique is that we\r\nare presented with a witness’s testimony that used both a label and a\r\ndescription of a transaction.  The witness described the transaction and the\r\nsurrounding circumstances.  The witness also testified that the transaction was\r\nnot a “loan” and that it was a “gift.”  The question upon which this appeal\r\nturns is whether, and under what circumstances, the label used by a witness\r\nwill control over and above the witness’s description of the transaction.  I\r\nbelieve the Court errs in giving conclusive effect to the witness’s use of one\r\nlabel and ignoring the description of the transaction in that analysis, and\r\nthen rejecting the same witness’s use of another label in deference to her\r\ntestimony about the description of the transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This appeal also presents the\r\nopportunity to clarify the appellee’s burden on appeal.  The issue is what must\r\nan appellee do to prevail on appeal if, as the defendant in the trial court,\r\nthe appellee won a take nothing judgment.  The confusion comes from the oft\r\ncited phrase describing the standard of review that where findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law are not available, as in this appeal, the appellate court\r\nmust affirm the judgment on any theory finding “support” in the record.  <i>In\r\nInterest

align=\"center\"><b><span>Procedural History</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose Lopez sued his former\r\nsister-in-law, Amy Lopez, for the conversion of a receipt or $15,000.  Jose\r\nfailed to convince the trial court, acting as the factfinder, that Amy had\r\nconverted either the receipt or cash.  The trial court, instead, opined that based\r\non the evidence the transaction was a loan and that because the loan was not in\r\nwriting, the recovery was barred by the statute of frauds.  Thus, the trial\r\ncourt rendered a take nothing judgment.  Jose appealed.  The evidence was both\r\nlegally and factually sufficient to “support” the trial court’s refusal to find\r\na conversion; therefore, the trial court did not err in rendering a take\r\nnothing judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Background</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Jose’s brother, Wenceslao Lopez, who\r\nat the time was also Amy’s husband, was being held by the INS (the United\r\nStates Immigration and Naturalization Service).  A $15,000 bond<sup><sup><span>[1]</span></sup></sup> was required for his release.  Amy and\r\nWenceslao did not have the money.  Ultimately, Jose handed Amy $15,000 in cash\r\nand, according to Amy, said, “let’s go get my brother.”  They rode together to San Antonio where Wenceslao was being held.  Because Jose had concerns about the INS also\r\ndetaining him, he had Amy attempt to deliver the cash to the INS.  The INS\r\nwould not accept cash.  A cashier’s check, rather than cash, was needed.  Jose\r\nwent to a bank he used and converted the cash to a cashier’s check and gave it\r\nto Amy.  Amy posted the bond using the cashier’s check and obtained a receipt\r\nin her name.  The receipt allowed the person who posted the bond to be paid the\r\namount of the bond once the INS case against Wenceslao had concluded.  In the\r\nfinal analysis, it is the proof, or lack thereof, to show the characterization\r\nof the legal nature of the foregoing described events that should control the\r\nresult of this appeal. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The next year, Amy and Wenceslao were\r\ngoing through a divorce.  Wenceslao attempted to get Amy to sign what she\r\nassumed was the paperwork to let Jose collect the bond money.  Amy refused\r\nunless her husband would drop his claim for custody of the children.  He would\r\nnot.  The disposition and/or ownership of this money was discussed during a\r\nmediation of the property division during the divorce.  It was not, however,\r\nspecifically dealt with in the divorce decree; but the decree awarded to Amy\r\nall the money in her possession and control.<sup><sup><span>[2]</span></sup></sup> \r\nAmy later asked her divorce lawyer what she should do with the money.  She was\r\nadvised that the money was hers.  About six months after the divorce, Amy sent\r\nthe necessary paperwork to the INS, which sent her a check for $15,000.  Amy\r\nspent the money on bills and private school tuition for at least one of her\r\nchildren.<sup><sup><span>[3]</span></sup></sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            An issue about the money did not arise\r\nagain until Jose filed a motion to show cause in San Antonio.  The case was\r\ntransferred to McLennan County where Jose filed a petition for a constructive\r\ntrust.  Although Jose pled only for a constructive trust, the theory of\r\nconversion was tried to the court by consent.  The trial court rendered a take\r\nnothing judgment.  No findings of fact or conclusions of law were filed.<sup><sup><span>[4]</span></sup></sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Sufficiency of the\r\nEvidence</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p

Proof</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Where the Court goes astray is\r\nreviewing theories <i>not</i> argued by Jose.  I have searched the briefs of\r\nboth parties and find no use of the term “bailment” or citation or argument of\r\nthis theory.  I do not recall it being part of the oral arguments made to the\r\nCourt.  It is a theory advanced by no one other than the Court in its opinion. \r\nI cannot hold that a trial court reversibly erred based on a conclusion made by\r\nthis Court on appeal that the evidence “points to” some other possible theory that\r\nwas never presented to the trial court or even to the appellate court by the\r\nparties.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            From my review of the proceedings, it\r\nseems pretty clear that the trial court determined that regardless of the legal\r\nmechanism under which the money was used by Jose’s brother, whether it was a\r\ngift, a loan<sup><sup><span>[9]</span></sup></sup>, or a\r\ntrust fund of some type, Jose failed to establish that he had not been repaid. \r\nIf the Court is going to point out other possible legal issues, like bailment,\r\nmaybe we should question why Jose did not make his brother a party.  After all,\r\nlike a loan, liability for the breach of the “bailment” will be a joint and\r\nseveral liability of the community estate; <i>i.e</i>. his brother will bear\r\nthe same liability as Amy.<sup><sup><span>[10]</span></sup></sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            The fundamental problem with relying\r\non theories not argued is that the Court has, I believe inadvertently, shifted\r\nthe burden on appeal to the party who did not have the burden of proof at trial\r\nand who has secured a take nothing judgment as a result of that trial.  When\r\nexamined closely, the Court’s opinion reveals that it is requiring the party\r\nwho was the defendant at trial, who won a take nothing judgment, to show that the\r\nfacts presented to the factfinder do not support any legal theory upon which a judgment\r\nfor the plaintiff could be based.  As an appellate court we should not shift\r\nthe burden on appeal to the prevailing party at trial to show on appeal that\r\nthere is no theory, including untried theories, which could support a judgment\r\nfor the plaintiff.  In this appeal, the Court holds that because bailment, a\r\ntheory argued by no one at trial or on appeal, might allow the otherwise\r\nunsuccessful plaintiff to prove a conversion of the bailed property, the case\r\nmust be remanded for a new trial.  I believe that is an erroneous placement of\r\nthe burden on appeal resulting in an improper reversal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Conclusive Testimony</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>(aka The Erroneous\r\nReliance on Labels)</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span> </span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            I began this opinion with expressing\r\nmy belief that this appeal presents an extraordinary opportunity to further\r\nclarify this Court’s method of conducting a sufficiency review.  I now return\r\nto that argument.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            What makes this the perfect\r\nopportunity to clarify the legal sufficiency review required under <i>City of\r\nKeller</i> is that the Court has determined what seems to be diametrically\r\nopposed rulings while parroting the <i>City of Keller</i> standard for such a\r\nreview.  The Court has held that by using the label “loan,” the witness, Amy,\r\nhas conclusively negated that the transaction was a loan by her testimony that\r\nit was not a loan.  The Court states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Amy’s testimony alone conclusively establishes\r\nthat the transaction was not a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span>* * *</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            To the extent the trial court\r\nimpliedly found that Amy lawfully possessed the INS receipt or its $15,000 cash\r\nproceeds because Jose had loaned her the money, no evidence supports that\r\nimplied finding because a reasonable factfinder could not disregard Amy’s\r\ntestimony that the transaction was not a loan.  <i>See City of Keller</i>, 168 S.W.3d at 807.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Thus, the Court has concluded that by\r\nher testimony that the transaction <i>was not</i> a loan; a reasonable\r\nfactfinder could not have concluded it was a loan.  As additional support, the\r\nCourt references the testimony of Jose that the transaction was not a loan. \r\nBut remember, we are looking only for <i>some</i> evidence, legally sufficient\r\nevidence, that the transaction was, in fact, a loan.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            I completely disagree that Amy’s\r\ntestimony “conclusively establishes that the transaction was not a loan.”  Even\r\nif I agreed, of what relevance to our review is this statement?  What does it\r\nmean?  Amy’s testimony using the label “loan” was only part of the evidence\r\nabout the transaction and her conclusory testimony, such as by the use of a\r\nlabel which has legal significance, is not conclusive proof of the fact to be\r\nestablished.  Further, other testimony conflicts with the “conclusive”\r\ntestimony that it was not a “loan.”  There was other testimony from which the\r\ncharacterization of the transaction as a loan would be proper.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[11]</span></span></span> \r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            But the intriguing analysis about the\r\nconclusive effect of using labels comes, not from another case, but from the\r\nvery same case, and not another witness, but from the very same witness.  Amy also\r\ntestified that the transaction <i>was</i> a “gift.”  With regard to this\r\ntestimony, the Court concludes that, notwithstanding her use of the label that\r\nthe transaction was a “gift,” a reasonable factfinder could not have concluded\r\nthat the transaction was a gift.  In this regard, the Court states:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>On cross-examination, Amy testified that Jose\r\nnever told her that the money was a gift.  She never expressed any thanks to\r\nJose for giving her the money, and she did not think the money was a gift until\r\nshe discovered that money was missing from her bank account during her\r\ndivorce.  Amy’s assumption that Jose gave her the money as a gift is not evidence\r\nof Jose’s donative intent.  Viewing Amy’s testimony about why and when she\r\ndetermined that the money was a gift in the light favorable to the trial\r\ncourt’s implied finding of a gift, a reasonable factfinder could not have\r\ncredited Amy’s testimony as evidence of a gift.  <i>See City of Keller</i>, 168 S.W.3d at 807.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>I disagree that the evidence conclusively proves\r\nthe transaction was not a gift.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            So, based upon Amy’s description of\r\nthe transaction, and comparing it to the labels to attempt to summarize her own\r\ntestimony and give a legal characterization to the transaction, the Court has told\r\nus that a reasonable factfinder could not have <i>rejected</i> her testimony\r\nthat it was not a “loan,” but could not have <i>believed</i> her testimony that\r\nit was a “gift.”  I find neither conclusion compelling because the Court is too\r\nfocused on the label applied to the transaction by the witness and not on an\r\nanalysis of what the testimony about the nature of the transaction would\r\nsupport.  But again, of what relevance is Amy’s failure to prove something on which\r\nshe did not have the burden of proof?  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            In this regard, the Court states that\r\nthe testimony of Amy conclusively proves the transaction was not a loan.  But\r\nher testimony is internally inconsistent between the nature of the transaction\r\nand the label she sought to apply to it.  It reminds me of the old saying that\r\nif it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it is a\r\nduck – no matter what you call it.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[12]</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            So will we review labels applied by\r\nparties who have an interest in characterizing the legal consequences of a\r\ntransaction?  Do we simply accept these conclusory statements, the label,\r\nwithout looking behind them to the true nature of the transaction as described\r\nby the witness?  I vote to reject considering only the witness’s use of a\r\nconclusory label and suggest that we must examine the true nature of the\r\ntransaction as testified to by all the witnesses.  We must consider the\r\ntotality of the evidence.  After all, this witness was not a lawyer and was not\r\nshown to know the difference between a loan, a gift, or a bailment.  Therefore,\r\nthe witness was not qualified to use a label that has now been given a\r\nconclusive legal meaning by this Court.  This is particularly true when the\r\nlegal label she used was in conflict with her other testimony about the nature\r\nof the transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            Further, these were theories that were\r\nnot even being tried at the trial court level as such and that Amy, the trial\r\ncourt victor and as appellee, did not know she needed to brief or defend\r\nagainst on appeal.  Now the Court is not only remanding this proceeding for a\r\nnew trial but also is handcuffing the defendant by purporting to conclusively\r\ndecide on appeal theories that would have been improper even for the trial\r\ncourt to decide.  Thus, the Court is going to make the parties retry the case\r\nand prevent the parties, in particular the defendant/appellee, from being able\r\nto show the true nature of the events.  This is because the Court is deciding\r\nthat at least two theories, loan and gift, are conclusively negated by <i>this</i>\r\nrecord, <i>i.e.</i>, the above-described testimony applying the above-described\r\nstandard of review.  It appears irrelevant to the Court that other evidence may\r\nbe introduced at the next trial by the party who should have had no burden at\r\ntrial or on appeal which may clarify or explain the evidence presented in the\r\nearlier proceeding.  At the very least, if no theories are off limits on\r\nretrial, in essence that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not apply to any\r\nclaim or defense, we should clearly and unequivocally state that so the parties\r\nare not confused and resources needlessly consumed briefing and arguing the\r\nissue of what it is the Court intended by its judgment and opinion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b><span>Conclusion</span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            This

significance,\r\nI note that likewise, the debt was not listed.  Wenceslao was aware of the\r\nissue at the time of the divorce.  His attorney, who testified at trial that he\r\nwas aware of the issue of the bond money, drafted the divorce decree.  If there\r\nwas a debt owed, it should have been listed as well.  This provides an\r\ninference that the debt had been paid by Wenceslao to his brother, Jose, and is\r\nsupported by the testimony of Amy.  Wenceslao was in the hall during trial but\r\nwas not called as a witness.  Amy certainly could not be expected to call him\r\nas a witness since he was a “hostile” witness because the Attorney General was\r\npursuing him for failure to pay Amy child support.  We are left to wonder, if\r\nhe had not paid Jose back, why Jose would not call him as a
