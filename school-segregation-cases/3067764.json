McGraw\n55 Public Square, Suite 2100\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEE\n\nTimothy J. McGinty\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor\nBY: Christopher D. Schroeder\nAssistant Prosecuting Attorney\nThe Justice Center, 8th Floor\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\fEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J.:\n\n       {¶1} Defendant-appellant Luis Nitsche appeals his convictions and sentences for\n\naggravated murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery and associated firearm\n\nspecifications in connection with two shootings — the December 23, 2013 shooting of\n\nBerry Dean and the January 17, 2014 shooting of Lawelden McDowell — for which he\n\nwas sentenced to an aggregate prison term of life without the possibility of parole plus 20\n\nyears. Nitsche argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the charges\n\nrelated to the two shootings. He also claims that the witnesses who testified against him\n\nwere not credible and that his convictions were, therefore, against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence. With respect to the sentences he received, Nitsche claims that the trial\n\ncourt violated his Eighth Amendment rights and abused its discretion in sentencing him to\n\nlife without the possibility of parole on the aggravated murder count without taking into\n\naccount his “young age” at the time he committed his crimes. Nitsche also contends that\n\nthe trial court erred in considering his gang affiliation at sentencing, in imposing\n\nconsecutive three-year sentences for the firearm specifications associated with Nitsche’s\n\nconvictions for attempted murder and aggravated robbery and in ordering Nitsche to pay\n\n$2,880 in restitution to McDowell’s family for McDowell’s funeral expenses. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we reverse the restitution order, remand for the trial court to consider\n\nNitsche’s present and future ability to pay restitution and affirm Nitsche’s convictions and\n\nsentences in all other respects.\n\fFactual and Procedural Background\n\n      {¶2} Nitsche’s convictions arose out of two incidents — a December 23, 2013\n\nincident in which Nitsche allegedly shot and paralyzed Berry Dean and a January 17,\n\n2014 incident in which Nitsche allegedly shot and killed Lawelden McDowell. On\n\nJanuary 29, 2014, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Nitsche on a total of twelve\n\ncounts related to the two incidents.     Counts 1 through 5 — aggravated murder in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.01(A) (Count 1), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) (Count\n\n2), felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) (Count 3), discharge of a firearm\n\non or near prohibited premises (Count 4) and having weapons while under disability\n\n(Count 5) — related to the January 17, 2014 incident involving McDowell. Counts 6\n\nthrough 12 — attempted murder in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2903.02(A) (Count 6),\n\nfelonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) (Count 7), felonious assault in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) (Count 8), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C.\n\n2911.01(A)(1) (Count 9), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3) (Count\n\n10), having weapons while under disability (Count 11) and discharge of a firearm on or\n\nnear prohibited premises in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3) (Count 12) — related to the\n\nDecember 23, 2013 incident involving Dean. Counts 1 through 4, Counts 6 through 10\n\nand Count 12 each carried one-year and three-year firearm specifications.\n\n      {¶3} Nitsche pled not guilty. Prior to trial, Nitsche filed a motion to sever the\n\ncounts relating to the two incidents from one another. Nitsche argued that he would be\n\nprejudiced if the offenses related to the two incidents were tried together, asserting that\n\fthe jury would be unable to sort through the cumulative evidence of both incidents to\n\nrender a fair verdict on each count individually and that he would be unable to assert all\n\nof his “best defenses” because they would “conflict with one another.”           The state\n\nopposed the motion and the trial court denied it. On the morning of trial, Nitsche moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the trial court’s ruling on his motion to sever. The trial court\n\ndenied Nitsche’s motion for reconsideration.\n\n         {¶4} Nitsche waived a jury trial on the having weapons while under disability\n\ncharges (Counts 5 and 11), and the remaining counts were tried to a jury. A summary of\n\nthe evidence pertinent to the issues raised in Nitsche’s appeal follows.\n\n         {¶5} In late September or early October 2013, Maryann Jackson met Nitsche, also\n\nknown as “Yellow,” through a friend, Karen Osborn. By November 2013, Nitsche was\n\nher boyfriend.    Jackson described her relationship with Nitsche as “crazy,” i.e., “one\n\nminute we can be cool and then the next minute we’re not,” “[a]rguing, fighting, stuff like\n\nthat.”   Although she and Nitsche were purportedly “exclusive,” while dating Jackson,\n\nshe also began seeing and “talking with” McDowell, who was also known as “Woo.”\n\n         {¶6} On the evening of December 22, 2013, Jackson went out drinking with\n\nMcDowell.      Jackson testified that Nitsche had apparently been informed that she had\n\nbeen out with someone else because when she came home, Nitsche called her and said\n\n“b****, come get me right now.” Jackson drove to Clark Avenue in Cleveland to pick\n\nNitsche up and the couple immediately began arguing.       Jackson stated that Nitsche was\n\nupset because another man had dropped her off and he wanted to know with whom she\n\fhad been.   She testified that when they arrived at Jackson’s apartment on Loop Drive in\n\nCleveland, they continued arguing and that Nitsche was “acting crazy,” knocking over\n\nJackson’s furniture and other belongings.     Although she initially denied it, Jackson\n\nultimately admitted to Nitsche that she had been out with someone else.           Jackson\n\ntestified that Nitsche demanded that she identify the other man she had been seeing.\n\nWhen Jackson refused, Nitsche told her to call that man.\n\n      {¶7} Jackson testified that, at first, she refused but Nitsche persisted and told her\n\nshe had “better call them.”   Because she did not want to disclose that she had been out\n\nwith McDowell, Jackson dialed a “random number” stored in her cell phone contacts list.\n\n That number was Dean’s.      Jackson and Dean had gone to middle school together and,\n\nmore recently, had run into each other at a club on West 6th Street.    Dean testified that\n\nafter meeting at the club, he and Jackson had talked on the phone a couple of times but\n\nthat, prior to December 23, 2013, he had not heard from Jackson “for a while.”\n\n      {¶8} Jackson testified that after she dialed Dean’s number, she hung up and told\n\nNitsche that he didn’t answer.   Nitsche told her to call Dean again.    At approximately\n\n2:00 or 3:00 a.m. on December 23, 2013, Jackson called Dean again and he answered.\n\nFollowing Nitsche’s directive, Jackson told Dean “to come back and come get me.”\n\nJackson testified, however, that she did not actually want Dean to come over because she\n\nhad not been out with Dean; she had been out with McDowell. Jackson stated that\n\nalthough she had asked Dean to come over, she knew Dean “wasn’t coming to my house\n\nor anything like that” because Dean had never been to her apartment and did not know\n\fher address.     Nevertheless, she told Nitsche that Dean was “on his way.”     Nitsche and\n\nJackson sat and waited for Dean.\n\n      {¶9} When Dean did not arrive promptly, Nitsche told Jackson to call Dean again.\n\n Jackson testified, that once again, she followed Nitsche’s directive and called Dean.\n\nDean answered, but Jackson “acted like he didn’t,” so Nitsche then demanded that she\n\ntext Dean.     Jackson texted Dean and Dean replied, but Jackson ignored his response.\n\nJackson testified that she did what Nitsche told her to do because he was “sitting right\n\nthere watching me” and she was “lightweight scared        * * * [b]ecause of what he might\n\ndo.” Nitsche then took Jackson’s phone and texted Jackson’s address to Dean himself.\n\n      {¶10} Dean testified that he received numerous texts from Jackson in the early\n\nmorning hours of December 23, 2013, asking him to come to her home and provided her\n\naddress.     In response to her texts, he left his home in Cleveland Heights and drove to her\n\napartment.\n\n      {¶11} Jackson testified that after Nitsche texted her address to Dean, she lied and\n\ntold Nitsche that Dean was outside and she then ran outside and called Dean.         Jackson\n\ntestified that Dean answered and that she told him not to come and that she would see him\n\nthe following day. Jackson explained that she told Dean not to come to her apartment\n\nbecause she was worried that Dean would tell Nitsche that Jackson had not been out with\n\nhim and that she would then have to disclose to Nitsche who she had really been seeing,\n\ni.e., McDowell.\n\f       {¶12} Jackson testified that when Dean did not arrive, Nitsche took Jackson’s\n\nphone, called Dean’s number and handed the phone to Jackson. Jackson spoke to Dean\n\nand asked him where he was.      Dean told her that he was on his way and Jackson and\n\nNitsche then waited outside for him. Dean testified that he spoke with Jackson several\n\ntimes while he was driving to her apartment but that he did not recall what was said\n\nduring those calls.\n\n       {¶13} Dean testified that when he reached Jackson’s apartment, he parked on the\n\nstreet. He started walking towards the building in which he believed Jackson resided\n\nand saw Jackson appear from the opposite side of the building. He testified that as soon\n\nas he saw Jackson’s face, he knew something was wrong.         He turned around to leave\n\nbut, in that “split second,” he was shot.     Dean testified that after he was shot, he\n\n“[i]nstantly * * * went paralyzed from the waist down” and fell to the ground. Dean\n\nstated that the shooter, a male with a light-skinned complexion wearing a hoodie and a\n\nblack ski mask, stood over him pointing a gun at his face.     The shooter reached down,\n\ntook Dean’s cell phone from his hand and his wallet from his back pocket. The shooter\n\nand Jackson then ran off. Dean testified that he did not know the person who had shot\n\nhim.\n\n       {¶14} Jackson testified that, as she approached Dean, he called out her name.\n\nShe saw Nitsche come up from behind Dean and shoot him once. Jackson testified that\n\nafter he shot Dean, Nitsche told her to get her car and meet him at the “back of the Loop.”\n\n Jackson did as Nitsche instructed. She testified that she did nothing to help Dean and\n\fdid not call the police or EMS “[b]ecause I was with Yellow.”         After the shooting,\n\nJackson and Nitsche went to Osborn’s apartment and while they were driving to Osborn’s\n\napartment, Nitsche was talking on his cell phone, cussing and saying, “I just had to shoot\n\nthis n**** over her, stuff like that.”   Jackson and Nitsche stayed at Osborn’s apartment\n\nuntil morning. The next morning, Jackson dropped Nitsche off on Clark Avenue in\n\nCleveland.\n\n       {¶15} Dean testified that after Jackson and Nitsche ran off, he put his car keys in\n\nhis mouth, dragged himself into the street and crawled towards his car using his arms to\n\npull his body forward.     As he crawled towards his vehicle, a police car approached.\n\nDean waved down the police car and Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority\n\n(“CMHA”) police officer Demetrius Jackson stopped and provided assistance.        Officer\n\nJackson testified that he found Dean lying in the street near 2768 Loop Drive, bleeding\n\nand in pain, unable to move the lower half of his body. Dean told Officer Jackson what\n\nhad happened, provided a description of the shooter and Officer Jackson called for an\n\nambulance, talking with Dean until the ambulance arrived.    After Dean was placed in the\n\nambulance, he passed out.      He awoke at MetroHealth Hospital.   Dean underwent seven\n\nsurgeries and was hospitalized for nearly two-and-a-half months.     He is paralyzed and\n\nwheelchair bound as a result of the shooting. The bullet with which Dean was shot\n\nremains lodged in his spine.\n\n       {¶16} CMHA police investigated the shooting of Dean. Detective Robert Weis,\n\none of the CMHA detectives involved in the investigation, testified that, later that\n\fmorning, CMHA officers recovered a spent nine-millimeter shell casing at the Loop\n\nDrive crime scene and obtained a statement from Jackson identifying Nitsche as the\n\nperson who had shot Dean. Jackson admitted that she did not immediately tell the police\n\nthat Nitsche had shot Dean.    She testified that it was only after the police told her that\n\nthey did not believe she had not seen the shooter and read Jackson her Miranda rights that\n\nshe identified Nitsche as the person who shot Dean. Weis testified that he investigated\n\nwhether there were any working cameras in the area that could have captured the shooting\n\nof Dean but found none. Based on Jackson’s statement, CMHA police undertook efforts\n\nto locate Nitsche and a warrant was issued for his arrest later that day, i.e., on December\n\n23, 2013.\n\n      {¶17}    Jackson testified that although she had ended her relationship with Nitsche\n\nafter he shot Dean, she continued seeing McDowell.        At that time, McDowell had a\n\ngirlfriend, Brittney Gardner. On the evening of January 16, 2014, Jackson was with\n\nMcDowell, Osborn and McDowell’s best friend, Donald Wylie, who was also known as\n\n“Don Don.”     At approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., McDowell and Wylie picked up\n\nOsborn and Jackson at Osborn’s apartment at 8201 Madison Avenue in Cleveland and the\n\ngroup rode in McDowell’s car, “riding around” with “no particular destination.”\n\n      {¶18} Wylie testified that he had been with McDowell the entire day and\n\nacknowledged that earlier in the day, he and McDowell had been “getting high,” “kicking\n\nback, having a good time.”    He indicated that he and McDowell had smoked “[a]bout\n\nthree, four blunts” that day but that they “were done doing what we was doing” when they\n\fwere riding around in the car with Jackson and Osborn.             He later admitted, on\n\ncross-examination, that they had been “getting high all night.”       Wylie testified that\n\nMcDowell and Jackson were “romantically involved” but that “it wasn’t that serious”\n\n“[b]ecause Woo still had Brittney [sic] and [Jackson] was still talking to Yellow.”\n\n       {¶19} Osborn testified that while the group was “riding around,” she received calls\n\non her cell phone from Nitsche.      She explained that Nitsche could not reach Jackson\n\ndirectly because Jackson had left her cell phone at Osborn’s apartment when they went\n\nout.   Osborn stated that she knew the calls were from Nitsche because she recognized his\n\nphone number and that, at first, she simply ignored the calls.\n\n       {¶20}   At some point during the evening however, Osborn answered her phone\n\nwhen Nitsche called, placing her phone on speaker so that others in the vehicle could hear\n\ntheir conversation.   Osborn testified that she recognized Nitsche’s voice and that Nitsche\n\ntold her Jackson was pregnant with his child. Osborn stated that Nitsche asked Osborn\n\nwho Jackson was with and began “mak[ing] threats.” Osborn testified that Nitsche said\n\nhe “was going to f*** her up wherever we’re at” and “kept saying” that he was coming\n\nover to Osborn’s apartment.\n\n       {¶21} Osborn testified that McDowell, who had been listening to their\n\nconversation via the speaker phone, asked Nitsche whether he and Jackson were “still\n\nmessing around and talking like in a relationship” and that Nitsche replied that they were.\n\n She indicated that McDowell told Nitsche that he and Jackson had been “talking” as\n\nwell and that Nitsche then asked McDowell whether he had a sexual relationship with\n\fJackson. According to Osborn, McDowell handed the phone to Jackson so that she\n\ncould answer Nitsche’s question but she refused.            Osborn testified that Jackson\n\n“wouldn’t say nothing” and kept pushing the phone away.             According to Jackson,\n\nMcDowell told Nitsche that he and Jackson had been seeing each other for a couple\n\nmonths and confirmed that they had a sexual relationship.\n\n       {¶22} Brittney Gardner, McDowell’s girlfriend, also called Osborn’s cell phone\n\nthat evening.     Wylie testified that, at some time earlier that evening, Jackson and\n\nMcDowell had been arguing and that Jackson went to McDowell’s house to confront\n\nGardner and inform her that she and McDowell were “messing with each other.”\n\nAccording to Jackson, she went to Gardner’s house to show Gardner “who Woo was with\n\nthat night.”    McDowell, Osborn and Wylie were present and witnessed the argument that\n\nensued between Gardner and Jackson. Osborn testified that Jackson knocked on the\n\nfront door and that when Gardner answered it, the two women began “exchanging\n\nwords.”    Before the exchange could became physical, McDowell broke it up and\n\nGardner went back into her house.\n\n       {¶23} After Gardner went inside, Jackson and Osborn left and drove back to\n\nOsborn’s apartment.      Approximately ten minutes later, Gardner arrived at Osborn’s\n\napartment with several of her friends.    Once again, Jackson and Gardner were arguing\n\nuntil McDowell arrived.     Gardner and her friends then got into her car and left.   Osborn\n\nand Jackson got into McDowell’s car and rode around with McDowell and Wylie.\n\f       {¶24} Wylie testified that in response to Jackson’s confrontation with Gardner,\n\nMcDowell called Nitsche to “talk it out.”       He indicated that, at first, Nitsche and\n\nMcDowell were “mad” and were simply “arguing back and forth.”          By the second call,\n\nhowever, it appeared to Wylie — based on what he heard from McDowell’s side of the\n\nconversation — that “[t]hey was kind of talking it out for real” and that things no longer\n\nseemed “that serious.”   Wylie testified that after the second call, he believed things had\n\ncalmed down and that everything was “okay” between McDowell and Nitsche.\n\n       {¶25} Osborn testified that when Gardner called her, she informed Osborn that she\n\nhad thrown out McDowell’s belongings and “f***** up” Jackson’s car. The group then\n\nreturned to Osborn’s apartment. Wylie testified that by this time, it was in the early\n\nmorning hours of January 17, 2014.           When they arrived, they discovered that\n\nMcDowell’s clothing had been cut up, covered in mustard or mayonnaise and scattered\n\nacross the yard and street in front of Osborn’s apartment building.\n\n       {¶26}   Jackson testified that she decided to call the police and went inside\n\nOsborn’s apartment to retrieve her cell phone.          Meanwhile, Osborn, Wylie and\n\nMcDowell began picking up McDowell’s clothing and placing it in the trunk of his car.\n\nOsborn and Wylie testified that as they were collecting McDowell’s belongings, Nitsche\n\nwalked around the corner of the apartment building, slipped and fell, and then got up and\n\nwalked toward McDowell.       Wylie testified that when he saw Nitsche, he asked him,\n\n“you ain’t on no bulls***?”    Wylie indicated that Nitsche replied that he “ain’t on no\n\nbull***” and that he just wanted to talk to Jackson. Wylie testified that because he had\n\fknown Nitsche “since he was a kid,” i.e., since Nitsche was 11 or 13, he “put [his] guard\n\ndown” and continued picking up McDowell’s clothing until he heard a “[p]ow.” Wylie\n\ntestified that he heard a single shot. He did not see who fired the shot but stated that\n\nwhen he looked up, he saw McDowell running past him and Nitsche holding a gun,\n\npointing the gun in his face, approximately three to four feet away from him.        Wylie\n\ntestified that, at the time, he did not realize McDowell had been shot.   Nitsche tried to\n\nsqueeze the trigger, but the gun jammed.       Wylie then “took off and ran.”        Wylie\n\ntestified that he was running with McDowell until McDowell “just started falling.”\n\n      {¶27} Osborn testified that when Nitsche approached, he told McDowell, “I got to\n\ntalk to you. I’m not on no bull s* * *.” When Nitsche was within arm’s length of\n\nMcDowell, he pulled out a gun and fired a single shot, striking McDowell.      She stated\n\nthat she “seen like little fire came out of the barrel of the gun when he shot [it].”\n\nAccording to Osborn, McDowell and Wylie ran and Nitsche turned the gun on her. He\n\ntold her, “you better not say nothing or I [will] kill you too,” then he ran off through a\n\nnearby field in the direction from which he had originally come.    Osborn screamed for\n\nJackson.   When Jackson came outside, she and Osborn ran around the corner of the\n\napartment building and found McDowell who had collapsed face first on the ground.\n\nOsborn testified that she called 911 but that because they were concerned the paramedics\n\nwould not arrive in time, she, Jackson and Wylie lifted McDowell up, laid him across the\n\nback seat of his car and drove to MetroHealth Hospital.    Shortly after he arrived at the\n\nemergency room, McDowell was pronounced dead.                Cuyahoga County medical\n\fexaminer Dr. Thomas Gilson testified that McDowell died as a result of blood loss from a\n\ngunshot wound to the chest.\n\n      {¶28}    Patrol Officer Mark Maguth with the Cleveland Police Department was\n\ndispatched to MetroHealth Hospital to investigate the shooting. He testified that when he\n\narrived at the hospital, McDowell was not breathing and doctors were attempting to\n\nresuscitate him. McDowell died before Officer Maguth could speak with him. Osborn\n\nspoke with Officer Maguth at the hospital and told him that Nitsche had shot McDowell.\n\nLater that morning, she gave a written statement to homicide detectives in which she\n\nagain identified “Yellow” as the shooter.   Osborn testified that she told the police she\n\nhad known “Yellow” for “[a] few years” and that she knew his “real name” as “Nitsche\n\nLuis.” She also identified Nitsche in court as the person who had shot McDowell.\n\n      {¶29} Wylie gave a similar statement to the police, informing them that Nitsche\n\nhad shot and killed McDowell, and identified Nitsche in court as the person who shot\n\nMcDowell.     Jackson also gave a statement to police.   She testified that she did not see\n\nwho shot McDowell.\n\n      {¶30} James Raynard, a crime scene technician and Thomas Armelli, a homicide\n\ndetective, both with the Cleveland Police Department, testified that when they went to the\n\ncrime scene shortly after McDowell had been shot, they recovered a fired bullet pellet\n\nconsistent with 9 mm ammunition. Detective Armelli testified that the police were unable\n\nto determine whether the bullet recovered at the scene of the McDowell shooting was\n\ffired from the same gun as the shell casing recovered at the scene of the Dean shooting.\n\nNitsche was arrested on January 18, 2014.\n\n        {¶31} Yolanda Goodwin, a “mutual friend” of Jackson, Osborn, Wylie, McDowell\n\nand Nitsche, testified that before McDowell was shot, Nitsche had told her that he and\n\nJackson were “together” and that Jackson was pregnant.         She testified that she also\n\nspoke with Nitsche “right after the shooting” and that Nitsche then told her that he had\n\nshot McDowell and that he had also tried to shoot Osborn but that the gun jammed.\n\nGoodwin stated that when she first spoke with Nitsche on the morning of January 17,\n\n2014, Nitsche did not know whether McDowell was dead or alive.\n\n        {¶32} Goodwin testified that after she spoke with Nitsche, she spoke with Jackson.\n\nGoodwin testified that Jackson had told her what had happened to McDowell. After\n\nspeaking with Jackson, Goodwin called Nitsche and spoke with him a second time about\n\nthe killing.     Goodwin gave a written statement to police nine months later, in October\n\n2014.\n\n        {¶33}     No gun was recovered that could be linked to the shootings of McDowell\n\nor Dean.       No hoodie was recovered that matched the description of the one Nitsche was\n\nwearing at the time of the shootings. Lisa Moore, a DNA analyst with the Cuyahoga\n\nCounty Medical Examiner’s Office and Curtiss Jones, supervisor of its trace evidence\n\ndepartment, testified that human blood was found on the tread of one of the boots Nitsche\n\nwas wearing at the time of his arrest.     However, no DNA evidence, gun shot residue,\n\nfingerprint evidence or any other physical evidence was recovered connecting Nitsche to\n\fthe crime scenes near 2768 Loop Drive or 8201 Madison Avenue or the shootings of\n\nDean or McDowell.\n\n       {¶34}   At the close of the state’s case, Nitsche moved for acquittal on all counts\n\nof the indictment pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A), arguing that the state had failed to prove\n\nNitsche’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to any of the counts. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion as to Counts 4 and 12, discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited\n\npremises, and denied the motion as to the remaining counts.\n\n       {¶35} No witnesses testified for the defense.     After the defense rested, Nitsche\n\nrenewed his Crim.R. 29(A) motion as to the remaining counts of the indictment. The\n\ntrial court denied the motion and after receiving instructions from the trial court, the jury\n\nbegan its deliberations.\n\n       {¶36} With respect to the counts related to the shooting of McDowell, the jury\n\nfound Nitsche guilty of aggravated murder (Count 1), murder (Count 2) and felonious\n\nassault (Count 3) along with the associated firearm specifications. With respect to the\n\ncounts related to the shooting of Dean, the jury found Nitsche guilty of attempted murder\n\n(Count 6), felonious assault (Counts 7 and 8), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C.\n\n2911.01(A)(1) (Count 9) and the associated firearm specifications but not guilty of\n\naggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3) (Count 10).            The trial court\n\nfound Nitsche guilty of the two having weapons while under disability counts (Counts 5\n\nand 11). Following the verdicts, Nitsche renewed his motion for acquittal pursuant to\n\fCrim.R. 29(C). Once again, the trial court denied the motion and immediately proceeded\n\nwith sentencing.\n\n       {¶37} Nitsche’s convictions for aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault\n\nmerged for sentencing and the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the aggravated\n\nmurder count. The one-year and three-year firearm specifications associated with each\n\nof the counts merged into a single three-year firearm specification. On the aggravated\n\nmurder count, the trial court imposed a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of\n\nparole plus three years for the firearm specification, to be served consecutively.\n\nNitsche’s convictions for attempted murder and felonious assault merged for sentencing\n\nand the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the attempted murder count. The\n\none-year firearm specifications on the attempted murder and aggravated robbery counts\n\nmerged into the three-year firearm specifications for each count.           The trial court\n\nsentenced Nitsche to 11 years on the attempted murder count and three years on the\n\nassociated firearm specification, to be served consecutively, three years on the aggravated\n\nrobbery count, to be served concurrently with the sentence on the attempted murder count\n\nand another three years on the firearm specification associated with the aggravated\n\nrobbery charge, to be served consecutively to the sentences on the remaining counts.\n\nThe trial court also sentenced Nitsche to five years mandatory postrelease control. On\n\neach of the having weapons while under disability counts (Counts 5 and 11), the trial\n\ncourt imposed a sentence of 24 months, to be served concurrently to the sentences on the\n\nother counts.   Thus, Nitsche was sentenced to an aggregate prison sentence of life\n\fwithout the possibility of parole plus 20 years (11 years on the attempted murder count\n\nplus three consecutive three-year sentences on the three-year firearm specifications).1\n\n       {¶38} The trial court did not impose a fine and waived court costs “based on the\n\nindigency of the defendant.” However, the trial court ordered that Nitsche pay $2,880 in\n\nrestitution to McDowell’s family “for the funeral bill.”             Nitsche objected to the\n\n“restitution issue” but did not dispute the amount of the funeral expenses.\n\n       {¶39} This appeal followed. Nitsche has raised the following six assignments of\n\nerror for review:\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 1:\n       Six years for consecutive firearm specifications for aggravated robbery and\n       attempted murder in the shooting [of] Berry Dean is error.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 2:\n       The trial court erred in ordering restitution.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 3:\n       The court’s failure to consider Nitsche’s young age in imposing a sentence\n       of life without parole violates his Eighth Amendment protection against\n       cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 4:\n       The court erred in considering Nitsche’s alleged gang affiliation when\n       imposing sentence.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 5:\n       The manifest weight of the evidence was not established to allow for\n       convictions in any of the crimes in either incident.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 6:\n\n\n\n       1\n        The firearm specifications associated with the having weapons while under disability count\nmerged with the firearm specifications associated with the aggravated murder count.\n\f      The trial court abused its discretion in joining, in one trial, the Berry Dean\n\n      and Lewaldon [sic] McDowell shooting incidents.\n\n      {¶40} For ease of discussion, we consider Nitsche’s assignments of error out of\n\norder and together where appropriate.\n\nLaw and Analysis\n\n      Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n      {¶41} We address Nitsche’s fifth assignment of error first.             In his fifth\n\nassignment of error, Nitsche claims that all of his convictions should be overturned\n\nbecause they were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶42} A manifest weight challenge attacks the credibility of the evidence\n\npresented and questions whether the state met its burden of persuasion. State v. Whitsett,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101182, 2014-Ohio-4933, ¶ 26, citing Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d\n\n380, 387, 678 N.E.2d 541 (1997); State v. Bowden, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92266,\n\n2009-Ohio-3598, ¶ 13. When considering an appellant’s claim that a conviction is\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence, the court of appeals sits as a “thirteenth\n\njuror” and may disagree “with the factfinder’s resolution of conflicting testimony.”\n\nThompkins at 387, citing Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 42, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 72 L.Ed.2d\n\n652 (1982).   Weight of the evidence involves “the evidence’s effect of inducing belief.”\n\n State v. Wilson, 113 Ohio St.3d 382, 2007-Ohio-2202, 865 N.E.2d 1264, ¶ 25, citing at\n\nThompkins at 386-387.    The reviewing court must examine the entire record, weigh the\n\nevidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the witnesses’ credibility and determine\n\fwhether, in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and\n\ncreated such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a\n\nnew trial ordered.   Thompkins at 387, citing State v. Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175,\n\n485 N.E.2d 717 (1st Dist.1983). In conducting such a review, this court remains mindful\n\nthat the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence are matters primarily for\n\nthe trier of fact to assess. State v. DeHass, 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967),\n\nparagraph one of the syllabus. Reversal on manifest weight grounds is reserved for the\n\n“‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’”\n\nThompkins at 387, quoting Martin at 175. This is not that case.\n\n      {¶43} Nitsche does not explain why he contends his convictions are against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence other than to assert that the “cloudy and shaky testimony”\n\nof the “citizen witness[es]” offered by the state — i.e., Wylie, Jackson, Osborn, Dean and\n\nGoodwin — lacked credibility and should not have been believed by the jury. Nitsche\n\ncontends that because the state’s witnesses included “young people with extensive\n\ninvolvement with drug usage and the criminal justice system,” their testimony “lacked the\n\ncredibility that would allow the jury to ‘rely upon it in the most important of your\n\naffairs.’” Nitsche’s conclusory assertions that the witnesses who testified against him\n\nwere not credible are insufficient to establish that his convictions were against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶44} Simply because certain witnesses had criminal histories or admitted using\n\ndrugs or alcohol or to being “high” on the night of the incidents at issue does not mean\n\ftheir testimony could not be relied upon to convict Nitsche. See, e.g., State v. Wells, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 98388, 2013-Ohio-3722, ¶ 130 (credibility of witnesses in murder\n\ncase was left to the jury where witnesses admitted they were high on crack cocaine the\n\nday of the murder and had “extensive criminal histories”); State v. Medezma-Palomo, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 88711, 2007-Ohio-5723, ¶ 36-37 (fact that witnesses “were all\n\nconsuming crack cocaine and heroin on a daily basis” and that several of the state’s\n\nwitnesses had criminal records did not preclude the jury from finding their testimony to\n\nbe credible); State v. Petty, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 11AP-716 and 11AP-766,\n\n2012-Ohio-2989, ¶ 41 (fact that witnesses had criminal records and struggled with\n\nsubstance abuse did not render their testimony unreliable; jury could properly weigh\n\ninformation regarding witnesses’ criminal histories and drug use in determining how\n\nmuch credibility to give their testimony).\n\n       {¶45} Likewise, a defendant is not entitled to reversal on manifest weight grounds\n\nmerely because certain aspects of a witness’s testimony are not credible or were\n\ninconsistent or contradictory.   See, e.g., State v. Wade, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90029,\n\n2008-Ohio-4574, ¶ 38, citing State v. Asberry, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP-1113,\n\n2005-Ohio-4547, ¶ 11.       The decision whether, and to what extent, to believe the\n\ntestimony of a particular witness is “within the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who\n\nhas seen and heard the witness.” State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99822,\n\n2014-Ohio-494, ¶ 54.\n\f       {¶46} The witnesses answered questions regarding their criminal histories and\n\nalleged drug or alcohol use during their direct and cross-examinations. The jury heard\n\nJackson admit that she had been drinking and was intoxicated the night Dean was shot\n\nand heard Wiley admit that he had an extensive criminal record and had been with\n\nMcDowell “getting high” most of the day on which McDowell was shot. Defense\n\ncounsel brought the inconsistencies in the witnesses’ testimony, any questionable\n\ntestimony by the witnesses and any potential biases on the part of witnesses to the jury’s\n\nattention for their consideration.   The jury was able to judge the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses for themselves and was “free to believe all, some, or none of the testimony of\n\neach witness appearing before it.” State v. Malone, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101305,\n\n2015-Ohio-2150, ¶ 29, citing State v. Ellis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98538,\n\n2013-Ohio-1184, ¶ 18.\n\n       {¶47} Here, there was eyewitness testimony from persons present at the scene\n\nidentifying Nitsche as the shooter in each of the two incidents.       Jackson identified\n\nNitsche as the person who shot Dean. Wylie and Osborn identified Nitsche as the\n\nperson who shot McDowell. These witnesses were not strangers to Nitsche; they all\n\nknew him well. Jackson was Nitsche’s former girlfriend. Osborn testified that she\n\nknew Nitsche “from around Madison [Avenue]” and that he was at one time a friend and\n\n“associate.”   Wylie testified that he had known Nitsche since he was 11 or 13 years old.\n\nIn addition, Nitsche’s friend, Goodwin testified that Nitsche admitted to her after the\n\nshooting that he had shot McDowell. All four witnesses also testified as to Nitsche’s\n\fmotive for shooting Dean and McDowell — i.e., a jealous boyfriend (or ex-boyfriend)\n\nseeking vengeance against the new man with whom his girlfriend, allegedly pregnant with\n\nhis child, had begun a relationship.\n\n        {¶48} After a careful review of the record in its entirety, we cannot say that this is\n\none of those “exceptional cases” in which the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created\n\nsuch a manifest miscarriage of justice that Nitsche’s convictions were against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Thompkins, 78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541,\n\nquoting Martin, 20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 485 N.E.2d 717. Accordingly, Nitsche’s fifth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n        {¶49} We now turn to Nitsche’s challenges to the sentences he received.\n        Challenge to Imposition of Consecutive Sentences on Firearm Specifications\n        Associated with Attempted Murder and Aggravated Robbery Charges\n\n        {¶50} In his first assignment of error, Nitsche contends that the trial court erred in\n\nimposing consecutive three-year sentences on the three-year firearm specifications\n\nassociated with Nitsche’s convictions for attempted murder and aggravated robbery in\n\nconnection with the shooting of Dean.\n\n        {¶51} Nitsche acknowledges that this court has previously held that R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) “allow[s] for multiple, consecutive firearm specifications to be imposed\n\nfor a single incident.” See, e.g., State v. Lawrence, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 100371 and\n\n100387, 2014-Ohio-4797, ¶ 12-16.        However, he asks this court to reconsider its prior\n\ndecisions and consider “the equities of imposing multiple firearm convictions for a single\n\nact.”   He further argues that “at the very least, a court should be required to undertake\n\fconsecutive sentencing analysis and justification” pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C) before\n\nimposing consecutive firearm specifications under R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g). This court\n\nhas already considered and rejected these arguments.      Nitsche provides no justification\n\nfor revisiting them here.\n\n       {¶52}   Ordinarily, a trial court is prohibited from imposing more than one prison\n\nterm for firearm specifications associated with felonies “committed as part of the same\n\nact or transaction.”   R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(b).    However, R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) creates\n\nan exception that mandates the imposition of consecutive prison terms where a defendant\n\nis convicted of multiple firearm specifications under certain circumstances.          State v.\n\nYoung,   8th   Dist.   Cuyahoga     No.   102202,    2015-Ohio-2862,      ¶   8-10.      R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) provides:\n\n       If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to two or more felonies, if one\n       or more of those felonies are aggravated murder, murder, attempted\n       aggravated murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery, felonious\n       assault, or rape, and if the offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a\n       specification of the type described under division (B)(1)(a) of this section [a\n       specification of the type described in R.C. 2941.141, 2941.144, or\n       2941.145], in connection with two or more of the felonies, the sentencing\n       court shall impose on the offender the prison term specified under division\n       (B)(1)(a) of this section for each of the two most serious specifications of\n       which the offender is convicted or to which the offender pleads guilty and,\n       in its discretion, also may impose on the offender the prison term specified\n       under that division for any or all of the remaining specifications.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶53} This court has construed R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) to mean that in cases such\n\nas this, where the defendant was found guilty of two or more felonies (one of which was\n\nattempted murder) and those felony counts included firearm specifications — of which\n\fthe defendant was also convicted — the trial court is required to impose prison terms for\n\nthe two most serious specifications and could also, in its discretion, impose a sentence for\n\nany other specification.        State v. James, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102604,\n\n2015-Ohio-4987, ¶ 41. This court has stated that although the General Assembly did not\n\nuse the word “consecutive” in R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g), R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) nevertheless\n\ncreated an exception to the general rule that a trial court may not impose multiple,\n\nconsecutive firearm specifications for crimes committed as part of the same act or\n\ntransaction. See Young at ¶ 9, citing State v. Vanderhorst, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n97242, 2013-Ohio-1785, ¶ 10. As this court has explained:\n\n        “The mandatory language of the statute (‘the court shall impose’) also\n        indicates the General Assembly’s intention that the defendant serve multiple\n        sentences for firearm specifications associated with the enumerated crimes,\n        such as [attempted murder, aggravated robbery] or felonious assault. Had\n        the legislature intended a per se rule that sentences for firearm\n        specifications must be served concurrent with one another, it could have\n        stated as much. Or, the legislature could have chosen not to codify R.C.\n        2929.14(B)(1)(g), which serves as an exception to the rule that multiple\n        firearm specifications must be merged for purposes of sentencing when the\n        predicate offenses were committed as a single criminal transaction.”\n\nYoung at ¶ 9, quoting Vanderhorst at ¶ 10, quoting State v. Isreal, 12th Dist. Warren No.\n\nCA2011-11-115, 2012-Ohio-4876, ¶ 71; see also Lawrence, 2014-Ohio-4797, at ¶ 14.\n\n        {¶54} In this case Nitsche was convicted of attempted murder, aggravated robbery\n\nand felonious assault— among other offenses — in connection with the shooting of Berry\n\nDean.    Each of those counts carried a one-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C.\n\n2941.141(A) and a three-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A), and\n\nupon which the jury convicted.       The trial court was, therefore, mandated by R.C.\n\f2929.14(B)(1)(g) to impose sentences “for each of the two most serious specifications of\n\nwhich the offender is convicted,” i.e., two of the three-year firearm specifications,\n\nconsecutively. Young at ¶ 10; Lawrence at ¶ 14; Vanderhorst at ¶ 10.        Because R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) requires the imposition of consecutive sentences for the firearm\n\nspecifications, the trial court was not required to make R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) findings\n\nbefore imposing multiple, consecutive three-year sentences on the firearm specifications\n\nassociated with Counts 6 and 9. Young at ¶ 10, citing State v. A.H., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga\n\nNo. 98622, 2013-Ohio-2525, ¶ 21.     “[T]he mandatory requirement to order consecutive\n\nservice of certain specifications under R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) supersedes the findings\n\nrequired by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).”    James at ¶ 46.\n\n       {¶55} Furthermore, R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) “applies to ‘multiple prison terms [that]\n\nare imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses[.]’”                 R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4).   A specification is a sentencing enhancement, not a separate criminal\n\noffense.   Thus, “[b]y its own terms, R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) does not apply to penalty\n\nenhancing specifications.” James at ¶ 47.      Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\n\nconvicting Nitsche of multiple three-year firearm specifications on the attempted murder\n\nand aggravated robbery counts or in imposing consecutive sentences for those firearm\n\nspecification convictions without making R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) findings. Nitsche’s first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Challenges to Sentence on Aggravated Murder Charge\n\f       {¶56} In his third and fourth assignments of error, Nitsche challenges the prison\n\nsentence of life without parole that the trial court imposed on the aggravated murder\n\ncount. In his third assignment of error, Nitsche claims that the trial court violated his\n\nEighth Amendment rights by sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole “due\n\nto his young age” or “at the very least” by not “acknowledg[ing] that his age was\n\nconsidered in the analysis of a just sentence.”   In his fourth assignment of error, Nitsche\n\ncontends that the trial court erred in considering his alleged gang affiliation in imposing a\n\nlife sentence without parole.   Nitsche’s arguments are meritless.\n\n       Whether the Trial Court Violated the Eighth Amendment by Imposing a Life\n       Sentence Without Parole Given Nitsche’s “Young Age”\n\n       {¶57} Nitsche’s constitutional challenge to his life sentence without parole on the\n\naggravated murder count is based on Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S.__, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183\n\nL.Ed.2d 407 (2012), Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1\n\n(2012), and State v. Long, 138 Ohio St.3d 478, 2014-Ohio-849, 8 N.E.2d 890.\n\n       {¶58} In Miller, the United States Supreme Court held that a sentencing scheme\n\nthat mandates a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for a juvenile\n\nhomicide offender violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.    Miller at 2464. In Roper, the United States Supreme Court held that the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit imposition of the death penalty on offenders\n\nwho were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed.           Roper at 578. In\n\nLong, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a trial court, in exercising its sentencing\n\ndiscretion for aggravated murder under R.C. 2929.03(A), “must separately consider the\n\fyouth of a juvenile offender as a mitigating factor before imposing a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole” and that “[t]he record must reflect that the court specifically considered\n\nthe juvenile offender’s youth as a mitigating factor at sentencing when a prison term of\n\nlife without parole is imposed.’” Long at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶59} Nitsche asserts that the same considerations that led the courts in these cases\n\nto conclude that juveniles “‘are less deserving of the most severe punishments,’” Miller at\n\n2464, quoting Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 130 S. Ct. 2011, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010),\n\nshould be applied to Nitsche, a “young adult * * * ‘raised’ dysfunctionally in America’s\n\nurban cores.”   We disagree.\n\n       {¶60} As the United States Supreme Court explained in Miller, juveniles are\n“constitutionally different from adults for purposes of sentencing”:\n\n       First, children have a “‘lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of\n       responsibility,’ ” leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless\n       risk-taking. Roper, 543 U.S. at 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1.\n       Second, children “are more vulnerable * * * to negative influences and\n       outside pressures,” including from their family and peers; they have limited\n       “contro[l] over their own environment” and lack the ability to extricate\n       themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. Ibid. And third, a\n       child’s character is not as “well formed” as an adult’s; his traits are “less\n       fixed” and his actions less likely to be “evidence of irretrievabl[e]\n       deprav[ity].” Id. at 570, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1. * * * [T]he\n       distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for\n       imposing the harshest sentences on juvenile offenders, even when they\n       commit terrible crimes. * * * [I]n imposing a State’s harshest penalties, a\n       sentencer misses too much if he treats every child as an adult. * * *\n\nMiller at 2464-2468. The Ohio Supreme Court relied on Miller in reaching its decision\n\nin Long.   Long at ¶ 1, 11-14.\n\f       {¶61}       Nitsche, however, is not a “juvenile offender.”   He was 23 years of age\n\nand had been an adult for five years at the time he committed the crimes at issue.\n\nTherefore, the considerations identified in Miller (and the other cases cited above) —\n\nwhich are based on the “significant gaps between juveniles and adults,” Miller at 2464\n\n— do not apply here.\n\n       {¶62}       The Tenth District recently considered a similar argument in State v.\n\nPhipps, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-524, 2016-Ohio-663. In that case, the defendant\n\n— who was 19 at the time he committed the offenses at issue — pled guilty to 21 counts,\n\nincluding aggravated robbery and kidnapping, arising out of a series of robberies,\n\nburglaries and home invasions.      Id. at ¶ 3, 35.   He was sentenced to an aggregate prison\n\nterm of 150 years. Id. at ¶ 3.        The defendant argued, based on Miller, Graham and\n\nRoper, that the trial court erred in failing to consider his “relative youth” as a relevant\n\nfactor under R.C. 2929.12 and that his youth should have been considered during\n\nsentencing because “he lacked * * * maturity and had an underdeveloped sense of\n\nresponsibility.” Id. at ¶ 33, 35.     The Tenth District rejected the defendant’s argument,\n\nnoting that there was no authority to support the extension of Roper, Graham and Miller\n\nto the defendant, who was not a juvenile at the time he committed the offenses at issue.\n\nId. at ¶ 37, 39.    As the court explained:\n\n       We are unaware of, and appellant fails to point to, any pertinent legal\n       authority to support the extension of Roper, Graham, and Miller to persons\n       who were not juveniles at the time of the commission of the offense. * * *\n       [I]n Roper, Graham, and Miller, the United States Supreme Court explicitly\n       referred to the age of 18 as the divide between juveniles and adults when\n       considering developmental differences under the Eighth Amendment. * * *\n\f       The United States Supreme Court explained its use of the age of 18 to\n       establish the divide as follows:\n\n       Drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections\n       always raised against categorical rules. The qualities that distinguish\n       juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. By the\n       same token, some under 18 have already attained a level of maturity some\n       adults will never reach. For the reasons we have discussed, however, a line\n       must be drawn. * * * The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line\n       for many purposes between childhood and adulthood.\n       Roper at 574.\n\n       Following Miller, the Sixth Circuit considered whether to extend Miller to\n       persons over the age of 18. United States v. Marshall, 736 F.3d 492 (6th\n       Cir.2013). The court found that “[c]onsiderations of efficiency and certainty\n       require a bright line separating adults from juveniles” and that “[f]or\n       purposes of the Eighth Amendment, an individual’s eighteenth birthday\n       marks that bright line.” Id. at 500. * * *\n\n       [O]n the facts of this case, we cannot agree that the trial court erred by\n       refusing to consider appellant’s age through extension of the holdings in\n       Roper, Graham, and Miller in the determination of his sentence.\n\nPhipps at ¶ 37-40; see also State v. Rolland, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 68,\n\n2013-Ohio-2950, ¶ 15 (“Roper, Graham and Miller are inapplicable” to a defendant who\n\nwas not a juvenile at the time of the commission of the offense because the protections at\n\nissue in those cases “apply only to juvenile offenders.”)\n\n       {¶63}   Like the defendant in Phipps, Nitsche “offers no persuasive justification\n\nfor the extension of the reasoning” in Roper, Miller and Long to the facts of this case.\n\nId. at ¶ 39. Although this case involves a sentence of life without the possibility of\n\nparole rather than a lengthy aggregate prison sentence, we believe the same reasoning\n\napplies. Nitsche’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole does\n\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\f       {¶64}    Furthermore, even if the trial court was constitutionally required to\n\nconsider Nitsche’s age prior to sentencing him to life without parole, the transcript from\n\nthe sentencing hearing reflects that it did so.   The trial court specifically noted during the\n\nsentencing hearing that “at the defendant’s young age of now 25 he had already several\n\nprior criminal convictions.”      Specifically, the court found that the appellant was\n\nconvicted in 2011 for domestic violence and attempted abduction and was sentenced to a\n\n12– month prison term; in 2009 he was sentenced to a two year term of imprisonment for\n\nreceiving stolen property of a motor vehicle and failure to comply with an order signal of\n\na police officer, and in 2008, after violating the terms of probation for a charge of\n\ntrafficking controlled substance, he was sentenced to a term of six months. Accordingly,\n\nNitsche’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Consideration of Nitsche’s Gang Affiliation During Sentencing\n\n       {¶65} In addition to his constitutional challenge, Nitsche argues that the trial court\n\nerred in considering his “alleged gang affiliation” when sentencing Nitsche on the\n\naggravated murder count.        Nitsche contends that the trial court made it clear at\n\nsentencing that “the reason” it imposed a sentence of life without parole on the\n\naggravated murder charge was because Nitsche was a member of the “Heartless Felons”\n\ngang “even though there was no evidence/testimony in the case about that issue.”           He\n\nfurther asserts that Nitsche’s “conduct in the crimes alleged does not explain the sentence\n\nhe received” and that the trial court’s imposition of a sentence of life without parole was\n\f“unsubstantiated, unjustified, and an abuse of discretion.” We have no authority to\n\nreview Nitsche’s sentence on this basis.\n\n      {¶66} R.C. 2953.08 governs the review of felony sentences. R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)\n\nprovides: “A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections\n\n2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section.”\n\nThus, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) expressly “excludes sentences imposed for aggravated murder\n\n* * * from appellate review.”           State v. White, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101576,\n\n2015-Ohio-2387, ¶ 67-68 (defendant’s claim that sentences imposed on murder and\n\naggravated murder counts were contrary to law because trial court did not engage in a\n\nproportionality analysis was not subject to appellate review under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)),\n\nciting State v. Porterfield, 106 Ohio St.3d 5, 2005-Ohio-3095, 829 N.E.2d 690, ¶ 19. As\n\nthis court has previously explained, “the general felony sentencing statutes are\n\ninapplicable to aggravated murder because ‘aggravated murder is governed by a special\n\nstatutory scheme, carries a mandatory punishment, is not classified by degree of felony,\n\nand is expressly exempted from * * * sentencing requirements inapplicable to felonies of\n\nlesser degrees.’” State v. Jackson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100125, 2014-Ohio-3583, ¶\n\n62, quoting State v. Hollingsworth, 143 Ohio App.3d 562, 567-568, 758 N.E.2d 713 (8th\n\nDist.2001). Nitsche was sentenced for aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2929.02(A)\n\nand 2929.03. Accordingly, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) applies.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Neither Nitsche nor the state addressed the applicability of R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) in their briefs.\n\f       {¶67} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) is\n\n“unambiguous” and “clearly means what it says: such a sentence cannot be reviewed.”\n\nPorterfield at ¶ 17; see also Jackson at ¶ 61-64 (rejecting defendant’s claim that trial\n\ncourt failed to consider his mental illness as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.12,\n\nnoting that “evidentiary review of a sentence imposed by a trial court pursuant to R.C.\n\n2929.03(A)(1)(a) is precluded”); State v. Hilliard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102214,\n\n2015-Ohio-3142, ¶ 29-31 (defendant’s claim that he was remorseful and had no prior\n\ncriminal record, that his crime “stemmed from a failed relationship that seemed to have\n\nprovoked [his] behavior” and that unspecified mitigating factors revealed in his\n\npsychological examination warranted a lesser sentence was not subject to appellate\n\nreview under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)); State v. Hawkins, 4th Dist. Gallia No. 13CA3,\n\n2014-Ohio-1224, ¶ 10, 13-15 (appellate court lacked statutory authority to consider\n\ndefendant’s argument that sentence for aggravated murder was “unreasonable” because\n\nhe “lived a primarily law-abiding life,” was “a ‘quiet, hard-working, decent person’” and\n\nhis actions against victim were “an aberration from his normal, quiet self” under R.C.\n\n2953.08(D)(3)); State v. Jones, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2012CA61, 2013-Ohio-4820, ¶ 26\n\n(“Pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) and case law interpreting this statute, this Court is\n\nwithout statutory authority to review appellant’s sentence on an evidentiary basis.”); State\n\nv. Patterson, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00098, 2013-Ohio-1647, ¶ 70 (same).\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3), we lack statutory authority to review\n\nNitsche’s sentence for aggravated murder on an evidentiary basis.\n\f       {¶68} Even if R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) were not a bar to review, we would still find no\n\nerror in the trial court’s consideration of Nitsche’s gang affiliation here.   Nitsche has not\n\ncited any authority in support of his claim that the trial court erred in considering his ties\n\nto the Heartless Felons gang when sentencing him. Nitsche does not dispute that he is a\n\nmember of the Heartless Felons gang and did not object when the trial court referred to\n\nhis gang affiliation during sentencing. In fact, the defense filed a motion in time to\n\nprohibit the state from “revealing any information that the defendant is gang affiliated\n\nwith a group known as the ‘heartless felons.’” The motion was granted. There was ample\n\nevidence in the record, however regarding Nitsche’s ties to the Heartless Felons gang\n\nfrom a pretrial hearing that the trial court held on the state’s motion to revoke Nitsche’s\n\nnon-attorney phone, visitation and mail privileges while in jail after Nitsche posed for an\n\nillicit in-jail photograph.3\n\n       {¶69} Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Nitsche’s affiliation with the\n\nHeartless Felons gang was only one of many factors the trial court considered in imposing\n\nhis sentence. The trial court’s reference to Nitsche’s gang affiliation followed a detailed\n\ndiscussion of Nitsche’s criminal history, the reprehensibility of his conduct, his lack of\n\nconcern for human life, the danger he posed to the public, his failure to take responsibility\n\nfor his actions and his lack of remorse. As the trial court explained:\n\n\n\n       3\n         The photograph — in which Nitsche flashed Heartless Felons gang signs\nwith his hands — had been posted to social media by a third party with the caption:\n“If all my reall 1st n***** out u wouldn’t even be able to brush my shoulders free\nyellow he say don’t let them n***** breath out ther.” Sic.\n\fThe Court has considered the record, and certainly the record includes the\ntrial of this matter where the Court had first-hand knowledge of the\ntestimony and the evidence presented against Mr. Nitsche and upon which\nthe jury itself found him guilty as previously noted.\n\nThe Court has considered the oral statements made here today and the Court\nhas considered the purposes and principles of sentencing under Revised\nCode Section 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors relevant to\nthe offense and offender pursuant to Revised Code Section 2929.12, the\nneed for deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restitution.\n\nTo begin with, the Court would like to record the defendant’s criminal\nhistory * * *. So at the defendant’s young age of now 25, he has already\nseveral prior convictions, criminal convictions. * * *\n\n[W]ith regard to the aggravated murder, Count 1, just finding out that Mr.\nMcDowell was the person who you believed then was actually seeing Mary\nAnn Jackson, within a matter of hours, if that, you decided to go and kill\nhim, walk right up to him in front of his friends and shoot him in the chest.\nThen, according to the testimony of the witnesses, Karen and Don Don, you\npointed the gun at them, and but for it jamming, you may have very well\nseriously injured or killed those other individuals who were there with him.\n\nYour conduct is reprehensible. It is despicable. You have no concern for\nhuman life. That’s absolutely been shown. Absolutely no concern for\nhuman life. You are a danger to the public, and I have a sworn duty to\nprotect the public. Again, no remorse. * * *\n\nAnd even though it did not come out in the trial, you are a Heartless Felon.\nYou are proud of being a Heartless Felon. You give the signs of being a\nHeartless Felon. You are tattooed with it. This is who you are, which is\nwhy I restricted your communications in jail. You take pride in being a\nHeartless Felon. And you try to impart fear in others that cross you.\n\nAnd it’s for that reason that on the count of aggravated murder, the Court is\n\nimposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole *\n\n* * *.\n\f       {¶70} Nitsche was convicted of aggravated murder in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.01(A), which carries, in this case, a life sentence. R.C. 2929.02(A). Pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2929.03(A)(1)(a)-(d), the life sentence could be without parole eligibility or with\n\nparole eligibility after serving 20, 25 or 30 years in prison. In this case, Nitsche was\n\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Nitsche does not dispute\n\nthat his sentence falls within the statutory range for aggravated murder.   Nitsche’s prison\n\nsentence is supported by the record and is not contrary to law.     Accordingly, Nitsche’s\n\nfourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Restitution\n\n       {¶71} In his second assignment of error, Nitsche argues that the trial court erred in\n\nordering him to pay restitution to McDowell’s family for the costs of his funeral.\n\n       {¶72} As an initial matter, we must first consider whether we have authority to\n\nreview the trial court’s restitution order under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3).        As stated above,\n\nR.C. 2953.08(D)(3) provides: “A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder\n\npursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review\n\nunder this section.”     R.C. 2929.01(FF) defines a “sentence” as “the sanction or\n\ncombination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is\n\nconvicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.” A “sanction” is “any penalty imposed upon\n\nan offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the\n\noffense” and “includes any sanction imposed pursuant to any provision of sections\n\n2929.14 to 2929.18 * * * of the Revised Code.” R.C. 2929.01(DD). Applying these\n\fdefinitions, “sentence” as used in R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) encompasses restitution.\n\nRestitution is not, however, part of Nitsche’s sentence imposed “pursuant to sections\n\n2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code.” Restitution is authorized pursuant to R.C.\n\n2929.18.    Accordingly, we conclude that R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) does not preclude our\n\nreview of the trial court’s restitution order in this case.\n\n       {¶73} We review a trial court’s decision to order restitution for abuse of discretion.\n\n State v. Maurer, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103162, 2016-Ohio-1380, ¶ 12; State v.\n\nMcLaurin, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 103068, 2016-Ohio-933, ¶ 8. 4                         An abuse of\n\ndiscretion implies that the trial court’s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or\n\nunconscionable. Blakemore v. Blakemore, 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 450 N.E.2d 1140\n\n(1983).\n\n\n       4\n          In State v. Marcum, Slip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-1002, ¶ 1, the Ohio Supreme Court, in\n“address[ing] the standard of review that appellate courts must apply when reviewing felony\nsentences,” recently stated that when “[a]pplying the plain language of R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), * * * an\nappellate court may vacate or modify a felony sentence on appeal only if it determines by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the record does not support the trial court’s findings under relevant statutes\nor that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.” The court’s application of R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) in\nMarcum was limited to sentencing-term challenges. See id. at ¶ 7, 10 (“[W]e hold that appellate\ncourts may not apply the abuse-of-discretion standard in sentencing-term challenges.”) Prior to\nMarcum, this court applied R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) in reviewing sentencing-term challenges and applied\nan abuse of discretion standard in reviewing challenges to restitution orders. See, e.g., State v.\nMaddox, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99120, 2013-Ohio-3140, ¶ 23, 53; compare State v. Collins,\n2015-Ohio-3710, 41 N.E.3d 899, ¶ 31 (12th Dist.) (holding that “R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) is the proper\nstandard of review for all felony sentences” and that, therefore, the “proper standard of review for\nanalyzing the imposition of restitution as a part of a felony sentence is whether the sentence complies\nwith R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b)”). Since Marcum was decided, this court has continued to apply an\nabuse of discretion standard in reviewing restitution orders. See Maurer at ¶ 12. Accordingly, we\napply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing Nitsche’s challenge to the restitution order in this\ncase. Even if, however, the standard of review set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) applied, it would not\nchange the result here.\n\f       {¶74} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), a trial court may order an offender to pay\n\nrestitution to the victim’s family “in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss” as\n\npart of a felony sentence.   R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) provides, in relevant part:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this division and in addition to imposing\n       court costs pursuant to section 2947.23 of the Revised Code, the court\n       imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony may sentence the\n       offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions\n       authorized under this section * * * Financial sanctions that may be imposed\n       pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n       (1)   Restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or any\n\n       survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. *\n\n       * * If the court imposes restitution, at sentencing, the court shall determine\n\n       the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. If the court imposes\n\n       restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an\n\n       amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence\n\n       investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or\n\n       replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the\n\n       court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss\n\n       suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of\n\n       the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold a\n\n       hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the\n\n       amount. * * *\n\n       {¶75} “Economic loss” means “any economic detriment suffered by a victim as a\n\ndirect and proximate result of the commission of an offense” and specifically includes\n\f“funeral expense incurred as a result of the commission of the offense.”               R.C.\n\n2929.01(L).\n\n       {¶76} The fact that a defendant is indigent does not preclude a trial court from\n\nimposing financial sanctions, including restitution. See, e.g., State v. Jennings, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 99631, 2013-Ohio-5428, ¶ 43. Likewise, the fact that a defendant is\n\nsentenced to a lengthy prison sentence “does not necessarily preclude the imposition of\n\nfinancial sanctions.” State v. Western, 2015-Ohio-627, 29 N.E.3d 245, ¶ 57 (2d Dist.);\n\nsee also State v. Fischer, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25618, 2013-Ohio-4817, ¶ 21\n\n(affirming restitution order in the amount of $6,025.18, imposed upon a defendant serving\n\na 50-year prison sentence); State v. Harwell, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25852,\n\n2015-Ohio-2966, ¶ 67-71 (trial court did not commit plain error when it ordered\n\ndefendant sentenced to 32 years to life in prison to pay restitution in the amount of\n\n$3,891.65). For example, “[t]he possibility of working while in prison is one factor that\n\na trial court can use in determining an inmate’s ability to pay financial sanctions.”\n\nWestern at ¶ 55, quoting State v. Croom, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25094,\n\n2013-Ohio-3377, ¶ 94.\n\n       {¶77} Nitsche concedes that his indigence did not preclude the trial court from\n\nordering restitution.   However, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay\n\n$2,880 restitution for McDowell’s funeral expenses because (1) the state offered no\n\n“documentary proof” of McDowell’s funeral bill at sentencing and (2) the trial court\n\ffailed to consider his “present or future ability to pay” restitution prior to ordering\n\nrestitution.\n\n       {¶78} Prior to ordering restitution, “a sentencing court must engage in a ‘due\n\nprocess ascertainment that the amount of restitution bears a reasonable relationship to the\n\nloss suffered.’”   McLaurin, 2016-Ohio-933, at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Borders, 12th Dist.\n\nClermont No. CA2004-12-101, 2005-Ohio-4339, ¶ 36. “The court must determine the\n\namount of restitution to a reasonable degree of certainty, ensuring that the amount is\n\nsupported by competent, credible evidence.” McLaurin at ¶ 13, citing State v. Warner,\n\n55 Ohio St.3d 31, 69, 564 N.E.2d 18 (1990). Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), if the\n\ncourt imposes restitution, it\n\n       “may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended\n       by the victim, * * * estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or\n       replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the\n       court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss\n       suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of\n       the offense.” A hearing on the issue of restitution need only be held “if\n       the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount.”\nId.\n\n       {¶79} In this case, the state submitted a receipt at sentencing evidencing the\n\namount — $2,880 — McDowell’s family paid for his funeral. It does not appear,\n\nhowever, that the state asked to have the receipt admitted into evidence as an exhibit at\n\nthe sentencing hearing and it is not part of the record on appeal.   Nitsche, however, did\n\nnot dispute the amount paid for McDowell’s funeral at the sentencing hearing.\n\nAccordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in ordering that $2,880 be\n\fpaid for McDowell’s funeral expenses — notwithstanding that the receipt was not\n\nadmitted as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing.\n\n       {¶80}   Nitsche also argues that the restitution order should be vacated because the\n\nonly information before the trial court regarding his present or future ability to pay when\n\nit ordered restitution was the fact that he was indigent and had court-appointed counsel.\n\n       {¶81} R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) “‘imposes a duty upon the trial court ‘to consider the\n\noffender’s present or future ability to pay’ before imposing any financial sanctions under\n\nR.C. 2929.18.’” State v. Aniton, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102440, 2015-Ohio-4080, ¶ 19,\n\nquoting State v. Tate, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25386, 2013-Ohio-5167, ¶ 52. R.C.\n\n2929.19(B)(5) states: “Before imposing a financial sanction under section 2929.18 of the\n\nRevised Code or a fine under section 2929.32 of the Revised Code, the court shall\n\nconsider the offender’s present and future ability to pay the amount of the sanction or\n\nfine.” As this court previously explained, in fulfilling that duty:\n\n       “The statute does not require that the trial court consider any specific\n       factors when determining a defendant’s present or future ability to pay\n       financial sanctions. Nor does the statute require a hearing on the matter.\n       The court is also ‘not required to expressly state that it considered a\n       defendant’s ability to pay * * *.’ ‘The record should, however, contain\n       “evidence that the trial court considered the offender’s present and future\n       ability to pay before imposing the sanction of restitution.’” * * * ‘The\n       court’s consideration * * * may [also] be inferred from the record under\n       appropriate circumstances.’”\n\nAniton at ¶ 19, quoting Tate at ¶ 52; see also State v. Betliskey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n101330, 2015-Ohio-1821, ¶ 42, 44 (describing what is required in considering ability to\n\npay as a “low threshold”).    “A trial court need not explicitly state in its judgment entry\n\fthat it considered a defendant’s ability to pay a financial sanction. Rather, courts look to\n\nthe totality of the record to see if this requirement has been satisfied.” State v. Lewis,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90413, 2008-Ohio-4101, ¶ 12.\n\n       {¶82} At sentencing, defense counsel stated that Nitsche had filed an affidavit of\n\nindigency, “is indigent as this point[,] * * * is unable to pay any fines or costs at this\n\nparticular point in time and has been declared indigent by the Court of Common Pleas by\n\nvirtue of [the] appointments [of counsel].”   No presentence investigation was conducted.\n\n There is no information in the record regarding Nitsche’s employment history,\n\neducation, skills, assets or present or future income sources and the sentencing entry does\n\nnot state that the trial court considered Nitsche’s ability to pay restitution. On the basis\n\nof defense counsel’s statements, the trial judge stated: “I’m not imposing any fine. I’m\n\nwaiving court costs based upon the indigency of the defendant. But I am ordering\n\nrestitution to the victim’s family for the funeral bill in the amount of $2,880.”\n\nConsidering the totality of the record in this case, although there is some indication —\n\nbased on the trial court’s reference to Nitsche’s indigency — that the trial court\n\nconsidered Nitsche’s present ability (or rather, inability) to pay restitution, there is\n\nnothing in the record that indicates whether the trial court considered Nitsche’s future\n\nability to pay restitution, as required under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). Given that Nitsche was\n\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, we cannot infer that the trial\n\ncourt considered Nitsche’s future ability to pay when it ordered restitution.      See, e.g.,\n\nState v. Russell, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23454, 2010-Ohio-4765, ¶ 62-64 (appellate\n\fcourt could not infer that the trial court considered defendant’s future ability to pay\n\nrestitution of more than $15,000 where defendant was sentenced to 40 and one-half years\n\nto life in prison and would be approximately 70 years old, at least, if he was ever released\n\nfrom prison); State v. Napper, 4th Dist. Ross No. 06CA2885, 2006-Ohio-6614, ¶ 15-17\n\n(vacating restitution order where it was “unclear” how indigent defendant with no assets\n\nand a prison sentence of 51 years to life would have “the future ability to pay the victim’s\n\nfamily”); compare Aniton, 2015-Ohio-4080, ¶ 21 (trial court complied with its obligation\n\nto consider defendant’s ability to pay restitution order where it considered presentence\n\ninvestigation report and noted that defendant, who had been sentenced to 21 years in\n\nprison, would “hav[e] 21 years in prison to pay off those costs”). The trial court,\n\ntherefore, abused its discretion in ordering restitution.\n\n       {¶83}    Accordingly, we sustain Nitsche’s second assignment of error, in part, and\n\noverrule it, in part. Since Nitsche did not dispute the amount of restitution ordered at\n\nsentencing, we reverse the restitution order and remand this matter to the trial court for\n\nconsideration of Nitsche’s present and future ability to pay the $2,880 in restitution\n\npreviously ordered.      See, e.g., State v. Graves, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99141,\n\n2013-Ohio-2911, ¶ 13-15 (where there was no evidence that trial court considered\n\ndefendant’s present and future ability to pay prior to imposing $2,000 fine, trial court’s\n\nimposition of fine and case remanded for a determination of defendant’s present and\n\nfuture ability to pay fine); see also Western, 2015-Ohio-627, 29 N.E.3d 245, at ¶ 57, 59.\n\n       Joinder of Counts Involving the Two Shootings\n\f       {¶84} In his sixth and final assignment of error, Nitsche argues that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his motion to sever the claims related to the shooting of McDowell from\n\nthose involving the shooting of Dean.\n\n       {¶85} Under Crim.R. 8(A), two or more offenses may be charged together if the\n\noffenses “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction,\n\nor are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts\n\nof a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.” Ohio law\n\n“‘favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial’” if the requirements for joinder under\n\nCrim.R. 8(A) are met. State v. Dean, Slip Opinion No. 2015-Ohio-4347, ¶ 59, quoting\n\nState v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990); State v. Williams, 73 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 153, 157, 652 N.E.2d 721 (1995); State v. Ferrell, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 100659,\n\n2014-Ohio-4377, ¶ 38.      Joinder is “liberally permitted” to preserve the public fisc,\n\nconserve judicial resources, reduce the opportunity for inconsistent results in successive\n\ntrials and diminish inconvenience to witnesses. State v. Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d 51, 58,\n\n600 N.E.2d 661 (1992); State v. Echols, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102504,\n\n2015-Ohio-5138, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶86} If, however, it appears that a defendant is prejudiced by a joinder of\n\noffenses, the trial court may grant a severance under Crim.R. 14. Crim.R. 14 provides, in\n\nrelevant part: “If it appears that a defendant * * * is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses *\n\n* *, the court shall order an election or separate trial of counts * * * or provide such other\n\nrelief as justice requires.” “Severance may be warranted if the trial court finds a serious\n\frisk that a joint trial would prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt\n\nor innocence.” State v. Jackson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102394, 2015-Ohio-4274, ¶ 12,\n\nciting United States v. Zafiro, 506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993).\n\n A defendant seeking severance must “‘furnish the trial court with sufficient information\n\nso that it can weigh the considerations favoring joinder against the defendant’s right to a\n\nfair trial.’” State v. Hand, 107 Ohio St.3d 166, 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151,\n\nquoting State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 343, 421 N.E.2d 1288 (1981). The defendant\n\n“‘bears the burden of proving prejudice and of proving that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying severance.’” Dean at ¶ 60, quoting State v. Brinkley, 105 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, ¶ 29.\n\n       {¶87} If a defendant makes a case for prejudicial joinder, “[t]he state may rebut a\n\ndefendant’s claim * * * in two ways.” Dean at ¶ 61; Jackson at ¶ 13. First, “if in\n\nseparate trials the state could introduce evidence of the joined offenses as ‘other acts’\n\nunder Evid.R. 404(B), a defendant cannot claim prejudice from the joinder” — the “other\n\nacts” test. Dean at ¶ 61, citing Lott at 163. Evid.R. 404(B) recognizes that evidence of\n\nother crimes may be admissible for purposes such as “proof of motive, opportunity,\n\nintent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” If one\n\noffense could be introduced under Evid.R. 404(B) at the trial of the other offense, had the\n\noffenses been tried separately, “any ‘prejudice that might result from the jury’s hearing\n\nthe evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would be no different from that possible in\n\nseparate trials,’ and a court need not inquire further.” Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 59, 600\n\fN.E.2d 661, quoting Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85, 90 (D.C.Cir.1964). Second,\n\n[“the state can refute prejudice by showing that] ‘evidence of each crime joined at trial is\n\nsimple and direct’” — the “joinder test.” Dean at ¶ 61, quoting Lott at 163. Where\n\nevidence of the joined offenses is “uncomplicated,” such that the jury is “capable of\n\nsegregating the proof” required to prove each offense, a defendant is not prejudiced by\n\njoinder. State v. Lunder, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101223, 2014-Ohio-5341, ¶ 33 (“A\n\ntrier of fact is believed capable of segregating the proof on multiple charges when the\n\nevidence as to each of the charges is uncomplicated.”); State v. Ferren, 8th Dist.\n\nCuyahoga No. 95094, 2011-Ohio-3382, ¶ 40 (“A trial court does not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying a motion for severance of trials when the state presents evidence that is direct,\n\nuncomplicated, and the jury demonstrates its ability to segregate the proof on each\n\ncharge.”)   “‘The object of the simple and distinct test is to prevent the jury from\n\nimproperly considering evidence of various crimes as corroborative of each other. The\n\nvery essence of the rule is that the evidence be such that the jury is unlikely to be\n\nconfused by it or misuse it.’” Echols, 2015-Ohio-5138, at ¶ 16, quoting State v. Echols,\n\n128 Ohio App.3d 677, 694, 716 N.E.2d 728 (1st Dist. 1998).\n\n       {¶88} Evidence of multiple offenses is “simple and direct” where, for example, the\n\noffenses involved different victims, different incidents or different factual scenarios and\n\ndifferent witnesses. See, e.g., State v. Dantzler, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 14AP-907 and\n\n14AP-908, 2015-Ohio-3641, ¶ 23; State v. Morales, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 03AP-318\n\nand 03AP-319, 2004-Ohio-3391, ¶ 21; see also Echols, 2015-Ohio-5138, at ¶ 16 (“‘Ohio\n\fappellate courts routinely find no prejudicial joinder where the evidence is presented in an\n\norderly fashion as to the separate offenses or victims without significant overlap or\n\nconflation of proof.’”), quoting State v. Lewis, 6th Dist. Lucas Nos. L-09-1224 and\n\nL-09-1225, 2010-Ohio-4202, ¶ 33.\n\n       {¶89} If either the “other acts” test or the “simple and direct” test is met, a\n\ndefendant cannot establish prejudice from the joinder. Thus, if the state can meet the\n\n“simple and direct” test, it need not meet the “stricter” “other acts” test.           Echols,\n\n2015-Ohio-5138, at ¶ 11 (a defendant is “not prejudiced by joinder when simple and\n\ndirect evidence exists, regardless of the admissibility of evidence of other crimes under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B)”).\n\n       {¶90} This court normally reviews a trial court’s decision on joinder for an abuse\n\nof discretion. State v. Banks, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 102360, 102361, 102362, and\n\n102363, 2015-Ohio-5413, ¶ 64, citing State v. Grimes, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94827,\n\n2011-Ohio-4406, ¶ 15. However, where a defendant fails to renew a Crim.R. 14 motion\n\nfor severance either at the close of the state’s case or the close of all evidence “‘waives all\n\nbut plain error on appeal.’”      Lyndhurst v. Smith, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101019,\n\n2015-Ohio-2512, ¶ 32, quoting State v. Howard, 3d Dist. Marion No. 9-10-50,\n\n2011-Ohio-3524, ¶ 82; see also State v. Ferren, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 95094,\n\n2011-Ohio-3382, ¶ 34. The record before us does not indicate that Nitsche renewed his\n\nmotion to sever at the close of the state’s case or the close of all evidence. Accordingly,\n\nhe has waived all but plain error.\n\f       {¶91} To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must show “an error, i.e., a\n\ndeviation from a legal rule” that was “an ‘obvious’ defect in the trial proceedings,” and\n\nthat the error “affected a substantial right,” i.e., a “reasonable probability” that the error\n\nresulted in prejudice, affecting the outcome of the trial. State v. Rogers, 143 Ohio St.3d\n\n385, 2015-Ohio-2459, 38 N.E.3d 860, ¶ 22; State v. Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759\n\nN.E.2d 1240 (2002). “We recognize plain error ‘with the utmost caution, under\n\nexceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.’”\n\nLyndhurst, 2015-Ohio-2512, at ¶ 32, quoting State v. Landrum, 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 110,\n\n559 N.E.2d 710 (1990).\n\n       {¶92} Nitsche does not dispute that joinder was proper under Crim.R. 8(A).\n\nHowever, he claims that he was prejudiced by the joinder of the offenses related to the\n\ntwo shootings and that the trial court should have, therefore, granted his motion for\n\nseparate trials because the two incidents were “both violent in nature” and “[a] jury\n\nwould, by nature, be more inclined to believe” his guilt of the offenses related to the\n\nsecond incident after hearing evidence of the shooting in the first incident and “vice\n\nversa.” Nitsche’s argument is meritless. In reviewing the evidence in this case, we find\n\nno prejudice to Nitsche as a result of the joinder of the offenses.\n\n       {¶93}    The offenses relating to the shooting of Dean and the shooting of\n\nMcDowell were charged together because they were of the “same or similar character”\n\nand part of “a common scheme or plan” or “course of criminal conduct” occurring over a\n\nrelatively short period of time. Nitsche shot Dean because he believed (or rather Jackson\n\fled him to believe) that Dean was the “other man” Jackson had been seeing while she was\n\npurportedly in an “exclusive” relationship with Nitsche. Within hours of Jackson’s\n\nidentification of Dean, Nitsche lured Dean to Jackson’s apartment and, as soon as Dean\n\nappeared, Nitsche snuck up behind him and shot him at close range in the back with a\n\nsingle shot. When Nitsche learned that Dean was not, in fact, the man Jackson had been\n\nseeing and that the “other man” was actually McDowell, Nitsche then targeted\n\nMcDowell. Within hours after Nitsche learned that McDowell had been seeing Jackson,\n\nNitsche located McDowell, approached him and shot him at close range in the chest with\n\na single shot.\n\n       {¶94} The trial court instructed the jury to consider each count separately:\n\n       The charges set forth in each count in the indictment constitute a separate\n\n       and distinct matter. You must consider each count and the evidence\n\n       applicable to each count separately, and you must state your findings as to\n\n       each count uninfluenced by your verdict as to any other count. The\n\n       defendant may be found guilty or not guilty of any one or all of the offenses\n\n       charged.\n\n       {¶95} We presume that the jury followed the court’s instructions.              State v.\n\nThompson, 141 Ohio St.3d 254, 2014-Ohio-4751, 23 N.E.3d 1096, ¶ 192, citing State v.\n\nLoza, 71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). There is nothing in the record to\n\nsuggest that the jury confused the evidence as to the various counts or was improperly\n\n“influenced by the cumulative effect of the joinder.” Banks, 2015-Ohio-5413, at ¶ 66.\n\fTo the contrary, the record demonstrates that the jury considered each offense separately,\n\nfinding Nitsche not guilty of aggravated robbery in Count 10, while convicting him of the\n\nremaining offenses. See, e.g., id. at ¶ 66-68 (defendant was “unable to show that he was\n\nprejudiced by the trial court’s refusal to sever his offenses” where he was acquitted of\n\nsome charges and convicted of a lesser offense in others).\n\n       {¶96} Nitsche offers no evidence or information to support his claim that he was\n\nprejudiced by the jury’s consideration of the offenses relating to McDowell’s murder and\n\nthe shooting and paralysis of Dean in a single trial. Nitsche’s bald allegations are\n\ninsufficient to establish prejudice. See, e.g., State v. Rosas, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n22424, 2009-Ohio-1404, ¶ 48 (defendant did not meet his burden of establishing\n\nprejudice for purposes of motion to sever where defendant failed to provide “very much\n\ninformation to the trial court about how he was prejudiced” and nowhere explained how\n\nhis rights were allegedly prejudiced but “merely assert[ed] broad general allegations of\n\nprejudice that any defendant could assert”); see also State v. Corker, 10th Dist. Franklin\n\nNos. 13AP-264, 13AP-265, 13AP-266, 2013-Ohio-5446, ¶ 21, quoting State v. Strobel,\n\n51 Ohio App.3d 31, 32, 554 N.E.2d 916 (3d Dist.1988) (rejecting defendant’s “bare\n\nassertions” of prejudice and noting that “‘there is always the possibility of prejudice in\n\njoining separate instances of any offense in the same indictment’” and that the defendant\n\nbears the burden to “‘either affirmatively demonstrate before trial that his rights would be\n\nprejudiced by the joinder, or to show at the close of the state’s case, or at the conclusion\n\nof all the evidence, that his rights actually had been prejudiced by the joinder’”).\n\f       {¶97} Nitsche allegedly committed both shootings due to jealously relating to his\n\ngirlfriend’s relationships with other men, and there were a number of common elements\n\nbetween the two shootings. As such, evidence relating to both shootings would have\n\nlikely been admissible at separate trials to prove Nitsche’s motive or identity by modus\n\noperandi under Evid.R. 404(B). Furthermore, the evidence related to each shooting was\n\n“separate and direct.”    Nitsche shot two different victims, at different locations, on\n\ndifferent dates. Different witnesses witnessed each of the shootings and separate police\n\nofficers from separate police departments investigated the two shootings, i.e., CMHA\n\npolice investigated the shooting of Dean and Cleveland police investigated the shooting\n\nof McDowell. Although Jackson provided testimony relevant to each of the shootings,\n\nshe witnessed only one of the shootings. Likewise, although the same forensic experts\n\ntestified regarding the testing of evidence relating to both shootings, the forensic evidence\n\noffered by the state was limited and was not so complicated as to result in confusion over\n\nwhich evidence related to which offense. Any claim of prejudice allegedly resulting\n\nfrom joinder of the offenses related to the two shootings was, therefore, rebutted by the\n\nstate under the “other acts” or “joinder” tests.\n\n       {¶98}    Further, claims of prejudice are less persuasive where, as here, the\n\nevidence is “‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict,’” regardless of whether the\n\noffenses were tried together. State v. Sapp, 105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822\n\nN.E.2d 1239, ¶ 73, quoting State v. Torres, 66 Ohio St.2d 340, 344, 421 N.E.2d 1288\n\n(1981). The testimony of the eyewitnesses to the shootings — Jackson, Dean, Osborn\n\fand Wylie — combined with Goodwin’s testimony and the other evidence offered by the\n\nstate provided strong evidence of Nitsche’s guilt on each of the offenses at issue. The\n\nstrength of the state’s evidence “‘establishes that the prosecution did not attempt to prove\n\none case simply by questionable evidence of other offenses.’” State v. McKnight, 107\n\nOhio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, ¶171-172, quoting State v. Jamison,\n\n49 Ohio St.3d 182, 187, 552 N.E.2d 180 (1990).\n\n       {¶99} We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the trial court’s denial of Nitsche’s\n\nmotion to sever. Accordingly, Nitsche’s sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶100} As set forth above, we reverse the restitution order and remand this matter\n\nto the trial court for consideration of Nitsche’s present and future ability to pay the $2,880\n\nin restitution previously ordered. Nitsche’s convictions and sentences are affirmed in all\n\nother respects.\n\n       {¶101}     Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part; remanded.\n\n       It is ordered that appellee and appellee share the costs herein taxed.\n\n       The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n       It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the Cuyahoga\n\nCounty Court of Common Pleas to carry this judgment into execution.\n\n\n\n\n       A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to\n\fRule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n______________________________________________\nEILEEN A.

McGraw\n55 Public Square, Suite 2100\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\n\nATTORNEYS FOR APPELLEE\n\nTimothy J. McGinty\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor\nBY: Christopher D. Schroeder\nAssistant Prosecuting Attorney\nThe Justice Center, 8th Floor\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\fEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J.:\n\n       {¶1} Defendant-appellant Luis Nitsche appeals his convictions and sentences for\n\naggravated murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery and associated firearm\n\nspecifications in connection with two shootings — the December 23, 2013 shooting of\n\nBerry Dean and the January 17, 2014 shooting of Lawelden McDowell — for which he\n\nwas sentenced to an aggregate prison term of life without the possibility of parole plus 20\n\nyears. Nitsche argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the charges\n\nrelated to the two shootings. He also claims that the witnesses who testified against him\n\nwere not credible and that his convictions were, therefore, against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence. With respect to the sentences he received, Nitsche claims that the trial\n\ncourt violated his Eighth Amendment rights and abused its discretion in sentencing him to\n\nlife without the possibility of parole on the aggravated murder count without taking into\n\naccount his “young age” at the time he committed his crimes. Nitsche also contends that\n\nthe trial court erred in considering his gang affiliation at sentencing, in imposing\n\nconsecutive three-year sentences for the firearm specifications associated with Nitsche’s\n\nconvictions for attempted murder and aggravated robbery and in ordering Nitsche to pay\n\n$2,880 in restitution to McDowell’s family for McDowell’s funeral expenses. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we reverse the restitution order, remand for the trial court to consider\n\nNitsche’s present and future ability to pay restitution and affirm Nitsche’s convictions and\n\nsentences in all other respects.\n\fFactual and Procedural Background\n\n      {¶2} Nitsche’s convictions arose out of two incidents — a December 23, 2013\n\nincident in which Nitsche allegedly shot and paralyzed Berry Dean and a January 17,\n\n2014 incident in which Nitsche allegedly shot and killed Lawelden McDowell. On\n\nJanuary 29, 2014, a Cuyahoga County Grand Jury indicted Nitsche on a total of twelve\n\ncounts related to the two incidents.     Counts 1 through 5 — aggravated murder in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.01(A) (Count 1), murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02(B) (Count\n\n2), felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) (Count 3), discharge of a firearm\n\non or near prohibited premises (Count 4) and having weapons while under disability\n\n(Count 5) — related to the January 17, 2014 incident involving McDowell. Counts 6\n\nthrough 12 — attempted murder in violation of R.C. 2923.02 and 2903.02(A) (Count 6),\n\nfelonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(1) (Count 7), felonious assault in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2) (Count 8), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C.\n\n2911.01(A)(1) (Count 9), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3) (Count\n\n10), having weapons while under disability (Count 11) and discharge of a firearm on or\n\nnear prohibited premises in violation of R.C. 2923.162(A)(3) (Count 12) — related to the\n\nDecember 23, 2013 incident involving Dean. Counts 1 through 4, Counts 6 through 10\n\nand Count 12 each carried one-year and three-year firearm specifications.\n\n      {¶3} Nitsche pled not guilty. Prior to trial, Nitsche filed a motion to sever the\n\ncounts relating to the two incidents from one another. Nitsche argued that he would be\n\nprejudiced if the offenses related to the two incidents were tried together, asserting that\n\fthe jury would be unable to sort through the cumulative evidence of both incidents to\n\nrender a fair verdict on each count individually and that he would be unable to assert all\n\nof his “best defenses” because they would “conflict with one another.”           The state\n\nopposed the motion and the trial court denied it. On the morning of trial, Nitsche moved\n\nfor reconsideration of the trial court’s ruling on his motion to sever. The trial court\n\ndenied Nitsche’s motion for reconsideration.\n\n         {¶4} Nitsche waived a jury trial on the having weapons while under disability\n\ncharges (Counts 5 and 11), and the remaining counts were tried to a jury. A summary of\n\nthe evidence pertinent to the issues raised in Nitsche’s appeal follows.\n\n         {¶5} In late September or early October 2013, Maryann Jackson met Nitsche, also\n\nknown as “Yellow,” through a friend, Karen Osborn. By November 2013, Nitsche was\n\nher boyfriend.    Jackson described her relationship with Nitsche as “crazy,” i.e., “one\n\nminute we can be cool and then the next minute we’re not,” “[a]rguing, fighting, stuff like\n\nthat.”   Although she and Nitsche were purportedly “exclusive,” while dating Jackson,\n\nshe also began seeing and “talking with” McDowell, who was also known as “Woo.”\n\n         {¶6} On the evening of December 22, 2013, Jackson went out drinking with\n\nMcDowell.      Jackson testified that Nitsche had apparently been informed that she had\n\nbeen out with someone else because when she came home, Nitsche called her and said\n\n“b****, come get me right now.” Jackson drove to Clark Avenue in Cleveland to pick\n\nNitsche up and the couple immediately began arguing.       Jackson stated that Nitsche was\n\nupset because another man had dropped her off and he wanted to know with whom she\n\fhad been.   She testified that when they arrived at Jackson’s apartment on Loop Drive in\n\nCleveland, they continued arguing and that Nitsche was “acting crazy,” knocking over\n\nJackson’s furniture and other belongings.     Although she initially denied it, Jackson\n\nultimately admitted to Nitsche that she had been out with someone else.           Jackson\n\ntestified that Nitsche demanded that she identify the other man she had been seeing.\n\nWhen Jackson refused, Nitsche told her to call that man.\n\n      {¶7} Jackson testified that, at first, she refused but Nitsche persisted and told her\n\nshe had “better call them.”   Because she did not want to disclose that she had been out\n\nwith McDowell, Jackson dialed a “random number” stored in her cell phone contacts list.\n\n That number was Dean’s.      Jackson and Dean had gone to middle school together and,\n\nmore recently, had run into each other at a club on West 6th Street.    Dean testified that\n\nafter meeting at the club, he and Jackson had talked on the phone a couple of times but\n\nthat, prior to December 23, 2013, he had not heard from Jackson “for a while.”\n\n      {¶8} Jackson testified that after she dialed Dean’s number, she hung up and told\n\nNitsche that he didn’t answer.   Nitsche told her to call Dean again.    At approximately\n\n2:00 or 3:00 a.m. on December 23, 2013, Jackson called Dean again and he answered.\n\nFollowing Nitsche’s directive, Jackson told Dean “to come back and come get me.”\n\nJackson testified, however, that she did not actually want Dean to come over because she\n\nhad not been out with Dean; she had been out with McDowell. Jackson stated that\n\nalthough she had asked Dean to come over, she knew Dean “wasn’t coming to my house\n\nor anything like that” because Dean had never been to her apartment and did not know\n\fher address.     Nevertheless, she told Nitsche that Dean was “on his way.”     Nitsche and\n\nJackson sat and waited for Dean.\n\n      {¶9} When Dean did not arrive promptly, Nitsche told Jackson to call Dean again.\n\n Jackson testified, that once again, she followed Nitsche’s directive and called Dean.\n\nDean answered, but Jackson “acted like he didn’t,” so Nitsche then demanded that she\n\ntext Dean.     Jackson texted Dean and Dean replied, but Jackson ignored his response.\n\nJackson testified that she did what Nitsche told her to do because he was “sitting right\n\nthere watching me” and she was “lightweight scared        * * * [b]ecause of what he might\n\ndo.” Nitsche then took Jackson’s phone and texted Jackson’s address to Dean himself.\n\n      {¶10} Dean testified that he received numerous texts from Jackson in the early\n\nmorning hours of December 23, 2013, asking him to come to her home and provided her\n\naddress.     In response to her texts, he left his home in Cleveland Heights and drove to her\n\napartment.\n\n      {¶11} Jackson testified that after Nitsche texted her address to Dean, she lied and\n\ntold Nitsche that Dean was outside and she then ran outside and called Dean.         Jackson\n\ntestified that Dean answered and that she told him not to come and that she would see him\n\nthe following day. Jackson explained that she told Dean not to come to her apartment\n\nbecause she was worried that Dean would tell Nitsche that Jackson had not been out with\n\nhim and that she would then have to disclose to Nitsche who she had really been seeing,\n\ni.e., McDowell.\n\f       {¶12} Jackson testified that when Dean did not arrive, Nitsche took Jackson’s\n\nphone, called Dean’s number and handed the phone to Jackson. Jackson spoke to Dean\n\nand asked him where he was.      Dean told her that he was on his way and Jackson and\n\nNitsche then waited outside for him. Dean testified that he spoke with Jackson several\n\ntimes while he was driving to her apartment but that he did not recall what was said\n\nduring those calls.\n\n       {¶13} Dean testified that when he reached Jackson’s apartment, he parked on the\n\nstreet. He started walking towards the building in which he believed Jackson resided\n\nand saw Jackson appear from the opposite side of the building. He testified that as soon\n\nas he saw Jackson’s face, he knew something was wrong.         He turned around to leave\n\nbut, in that “split second,” he was shot.     Dean testified that after he was shot, he\n\n“[i]nstantly * * * went paralyzed from the waist down” and fell to the ground. Dean\n\nstated that the shooter, a male with a light-skinned complexion wearing a hoodie and a\n\nblack ski mask, stood over him pointing a gun at his face.     The shooter reached down,\n\ntook Dean’s cell phone from his hand and his wallet from his back pocket. The shooter\n\nand Jackson then ran off. Dean testified that he did not know the person who had shot\n\nhim.\n\n       {¶14} Jackson testified that, as she approached Dean, he called out her name.\n\nShe saw Nitsche come up from behind Dean and shoot him once. Jackson testified that\n\nafter he shot Dean, Nitsche told her to get her car and meet him at the “back of the Loop.”\n\n Jackson did as Nitsche instructed. She testified that she did nothing to help Dean and\n\fdid not call the police or EMS “[b]ecause I was with Yellow.”         After the shooting,\n\nJackson and Nitsche went to Osborn’s apartment and while they were driving to Osborn’s\n\napartment, Nitsche was talking on his cell phone, cussing and saying, “I just had to shoot\n\nthis n**** over her, stuff like that.”   Jackson and Nitsche stayed at Osborn’s apartment\n\nuntil morning. The next morning, Jackson dropped Nitsche off on Clark Avenue in\n\nCleveland.\n\n       {¶15} Dean testified that after Jackson and Nitsche ran off, he put his car keys in\n\nhis mouth, dragged himself into the street and crawled towards his car using his arms to\n\npull his body forward.     As he crawled towards his vehicle, a police car approached.\n\nDean waved down the police car and Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority\n\n(“CMHA”) police officer Demetrius Jackson stopped and provided assistance.        Officer\n\nJackson testified that he found Dean lying in the street near 2768 Loop Drive, bleeding\n\nand in pain, unable to move the lower half of his body. Dean told Officer Jackson what\n\nhad happened, provided a description of the shooter and Officer Jackson called for an\n\nambulance, talking with Dean until the ambulance arrived.    After Dean was placed in the\n\nambulance, he passed out.      He awoke at MetroHealth Hospital.   Dean underwent seven\n\nsurgeries and was hospitalized for nearly two-and-a-half months.     He is paralyzed and\n\nwheelchair bound as a result of the shooting. The bullet with which Dean was shot\n\nremains lodged in his spine.\n\n       {¶16} CMHA police investigated the shooting of Dean. Detective Robert Weis,\n\none of the CMHA detectives involved in the investigation, testified that, later that\n\fmorning, CMHA officers recovered a spent nine-millimeter shell casing at the Loop\n\nDrive crime scene and obtained a statement from Jackson identifying Nitsche as the\n\nperson who had shot Dean. Jackson admitted that she did not immediately tell the police\n\nthat Nitsche had shot Dean.    She testified that it was only after the police told her that\n\nthey did not believe she had not seen the shooter and read Jackson her Miranda rights that\n\nshe identified Nitsche as the person who shot Dean. Weis testified that he investigated\n\nwhether there were any working cameras in the area that could have captured the shooting\n\nof Dean but found none. Based on Jackson’s statement, CMHA police undertook efforts\n\nto locate Nitsche and a warrant was issued for his arrest later that day, i.e., on December\n\n23, 2013.\n\n      {¶17}    Jackson testified that although she had ended her relationship with Nitsche\n\nafter he shot Dean, she continued seeing McDowell.        At that time, McDowell had a\n\ngirlfriend, Brittney Gardner. On the evening of January 16, 2014, Jackson was with\n\nMcDowell, Osborn and McDowell’s best friend, Donald Wylie, who was also known as\n\n“Don Don.”     At approximately 8:00 or 9:00 p.m., McDowell and Wylie picked up\n\nOsborn and Jackson at Osborn’s apartment at 8201 Madison Avenue in Cleveland and the\n\ngroup rode in McDowell’s car, “riding around” with “no particular destination.”\n\n      {¶18} Wylie testified that he had been with McDowell the entire day and\n\nacknowledged that earlier in the day, he and McDowell had been “getting high,” “kicking\n\nback, having a good time.”    He indicated that he and McDowell had smoked “[a]bout\n\nthree, four blunts” that day but that they “were done doing what we was doing” when they\n\fwere riding around in the car with Jackson and Osborn.             He later admitted, on\n\ncross-examination, that they had been “getting high all night.”       Wylie testified that\n\nMcDowell and Jackson were “romantically involved” but that “it wasn’t that serious”\n\n“[b]ecause Woo still had Brittney [sic] and [Jackson] was still talking to Yellow.”\n\n       {¶19} Osborn testified that while the group was “riding around,” she received calls\n\non her cell phone from Nitsche.      She explained that Nitsche could not reach Jackson\n\ndirectly because Jackson had left her cell phone at Osborn’s apartment when they went\n\nout.   Osborn stated that she knew the calls were from Nitsche because she recognized his\n\nphone number and that, at first, she simply ignored the calls.\n\n       {¶20}   At some point during the evening however, Osborn answered her phone\n\nwhen Nitsche called, placing her phone on speaker so that others in the vehicle could hear\n\ntheir conversation.   Osborn testified that she recognized Nitsche’s voice and that Nitsche\n\ntold her Jackson was pregnant with his child. Osborn stated that Nitsche asked Osborn\n\nwho Jackson was with and began “mak[ing] threats.” Osborn testified that Nitsche said\n\nhe “was going to f*** her up wherever we’re at” and “kept saying” that he was coming\n\nover to Osborn’s apartment.\n\n       {¶21} Osborn testified that McDowell, who had been listening to their\n\nconversation via the speaker phone, asked Nitsche whether he and Jackson were “still\n\nmessing around and talking like in a relationship” and that Nitsche replied that they were.\n\n She indicated that McDowell told Nitsche that he and Jackson had been “talking” as\n\nwell and that Nitsche then asked McDowell whether he had a sexual relationship with\n\fJackson. According to Osborn, McDowell handed the phone to Jackson so that she\n\ncould answer Nitsche’s question but she refused.            Osborn testified that Jackson\n\n“wouldn’t say nothing” and kept pushing the phone away.             According to Jackson,\n\nMcDowell told Nitsche that he and Jackson had been seeing each other for a couple\n\nmonths and confirmed that they had a sexual relationship.\n\n       {¶22} Brittney Gardner, McDowell’s girlfriend, also called Osborn’s cell phone\n\nthat evening.     Wylie testified that, at some time earlier that evening, Jackson and\n\nMcDowell had been arguing and that Jackson went to McDowell’s house to confront\n\nGardner and inform her that she and McDowell were “messing with each other.”\n\nAccording to Jackson, she went to Gardner’s house to show Gardner “who Woo was with\n\nthat night.”    McDowell, Osborn and Wylie were present and witnessed the argument that\n\nensued between Gardner and Jackson. Osborn testified that Jackson knocked on the\n\nfront door and that when Gardner answered it, the two women began “exchanging\n\nwords.”    Before the exchange could became physical, McDowell broke it up and\n\nGardner went back into her house.\n\n       {¶23} After Gardner went inside, Jackson and Osborn left and drove back to\n\nOsborn’s apartment.      Approximately ten minutes later, Gardner arrived at Osborn’s\n\napartment with several of her friends.    Once again, Jackson and Gardner were arguing\n\nuntil McDowell arrived.     Gardner and her friends then got into her car and left.   Osborn\n\nand Jackson got into McDowell’s car and rode around with McDowell and Wylie.\n\f       {¶24} Wylie testified that in response to Jackson’s confrontation with Gardner,\n\nMcDowell called Nitsche to “talk it out.”       He indicated that, at first, Nitsche and\n\nMcDowell were “mad” and were simply “arguing back and forth.”          By the second call,\n\nhowever, it appeared to Wylie — based on what he heard from McDowell’s side of the\n\nconversation — that “[t]hey was kind of talking it out for real” and that things no longer\n\nseemed “that serious.”   Wylie testified that after the second call, he believed things had\n\ncalmed down and that everything was “okay” between McDowell and Nitsche.\n\n       {¶25} Osborn testified that when Gardner called her, she informed Osborn that she\n\nhad thrown out McDowell’s belongings and “f***** up” Jackson’s car. The group then\n\nreturned to Osborn’s apartment. Wylie testified that by this time, it was in the early\n\nmorning hours of January 17, 2014.           When they arrived, they discovered that\n\nMcDowell’s clothing had been cut up, covered in mustard or mayonnaise and scattered\n\nacross the yard and street in front of Osborn’s apartment building.\n\n       {¶26}   Jackson testified that she decided to call the police and went inside\n\nOsborn’s apartment to retrieve her cell phone.          Meanwhile, Osborn, Wylie and\n\nMcDowell began picking up McDowell’s clothing and placing it in the trunk of his car.\n\nOsborn and Wylie testified that as they were collecting McDowell’s belongings, Nitsche\n\nwalked around the corner of the apartment building, slipped and fell, and then got up and\n\nwalked toward McDowell.       Wylie testified that when he saw Nitsche, he asked him,\n\n“you ain’t on no bulls***?”    Wylie indicated that Nitsche replied that he “ain’t on no\n\nbull***” and that he just wanted to talk to Jackson. Wylie testified that because he had\n\fknown Nitsche “since he was a kid,” i.e., since Nitsche was 11 or 13, he “put [his] guard\n\ndown” and continued picking up McDowell’s clothing until he heard a “[p]ow.” Wylie\n\ntestified that he heard a single shot. He did not see who fired the shot but stated that\n\nwhen he looked up, he saw McDowell running past him and Nitsche holding a gun,\n\npointing the gun in his face, approximately three to four feet away from him.        Wylie\n\ntestified that, at the time, he did not realize McDowell had been shot.   Nitsche tried to\n\nsqueeze the trigger, but the gun jammed.       Wylie then “took off and ran.”        Wylie\n\ntestified that he was running with McDowell until McDowell “just started falling.”\n\n      {¶27} Osborn testified that when Nitsche approached, he told McDowell, “I got to\n\ntalk to you. I’m not on no bull s* * *.” When Nitsche was within arm’s length of\n\nMcDowell, he pulled out a gun and fired a single shot, striking McDowell.      She stated\n\nthat she “seen like little fire came out of the barrel of the gun when he shot [it].”\n\nAccording to Osborn, McDowell and Wylie ran and Nitsche turned the gun on her. He\n\ntold her, “you better not say nothing or I [will] kill you too,” then he ran off through a\n\nnearby field in the direction from which he had originally come.    Osborn screamed for\n\nJackson.   When Jackson came outside, she and Osborn ran around the corner of the\n\napartment building and found McDowell who had collapsed face first on the ground.\n\nOsborn testified that she called 911 but that because they were concerned the paramedics\n\nwould not arrive in time, she, Jackson and Wylie lifted McDowell up, laid him across the\n\nback seat of his car and drove to MetroHealth Hospital.    Shortly after he arrived at the\n\nemergency room, McDowell was pronounced dead.                Cuyahoga County medical\n\fexaminer Dr. Thomas Gilson testified that McDowell died as a result of blood loss from a\n\ngunshot wound to the chest.\n\n      {¶28}    Patrol Officer Mark Maguth with the Cleveland Police Department was\n\ndispatched to MetroHealth Hospital to investigate the shooting. He testified that when he\n\narrived at the hospital, McDowell was not breathing and doctors were attempting to\n\nresuscitate him. McDowell died before Officer Maguth could speak with him. Osborn\n\nspoke with Officer Maguth at the hospital and told him that Nitsche had shot McDowell.\n\nLater that morning, she gave a written statement to homicide detectives in which she\n\nagain identified “Yellow” as the shooter.   Osborn testified that she told the police she\n\nhad known “Yellow” for “[a] few years” and that she knew his “real name” as “Nitsche\n\nLuis.” She also identified Nitsche in court as the person who had shot McDowell.\n\n      {¶29} Wylie gave a similar statement to the police, informing them that Nitsche\n\nhad shot and killed McDowell, and identified Nitsche in court as the person who shot\n\nMcDowell.     Jackson also gave a statement to police.   She testified that she did not see\n\nwho shot McDowell.\n\n      {¶30} James Raynard, a crime scene technician and Thomas Armelli, a homicide\n\ndetective, both with the Cleveland Police Department, testified that when they went to the\n\ncrime scene shortly after McDowell had been shot, they recovered a fired bullet pellet\n\nconsistent with 9 mm ammunition. Detective Armelli testified that the police were unable\n\nto determine whether the bullet recovered at the scene of the McDowell shooting was\n\ffired from the same gun as the shell casing recovered at the scene of the Dean shooting.\n\nNitsche was arrested on January 18, 2014.\n\n        {¶31} Yolanda Goodwin, a “mutual friend” of Jackson, Osborn, Wylie, McDowell\n\nand Nitsche, testified that before McDowell was shot, Nitsche had told her that he and\n\nJackson were “together” and that Jackson was pregnant.         She testified that she also\n\nspoke with Nitsche “right after the shooting” and that Nitsche then told her that he had\n\nshot McDowell and that he had also tried to shoot Osborn but that the gun jammed.\n\nGoodwin stated that when she first spoke with Nitsche on the morning of January 17,\n\n2014, Nitsche did not know whether McDowell was dead or alive.\n\n        {¶32} Goodwin testified that after she spoke with Nitsche, she spoke with Jackson.\n\nGoodwin testified that Jackson had told her what had happened to McDowell. After\n\nspeaking with Jackson, Goodwin called Nitsche and spoke with him a second time about\n\nthe killing.     Goodwin gave a written statement to police nine months later, in October\n\n2014.\n\n        {¶33}     No gun was recovered that could be linked to the shootings of McDowell\n\nor Dean.       No hoodie was recovered that matched the description of the one Nitsche was\n\nwearing at the time of the shootings. Lisa Moore, a DNA analyst with the Cuyahoga\n\nCounty Medical Examiner’s Office and Curtiss Jones, supervisor of its trace evidence\n\ndepartment, testified that human blood was found on the tread of one of the boots Nitsche\n\nwas wearing at the time of his arrest.     However, no DNA evidence, gun shot residue,\n\nfingerprint evidence or any other physical evidence was recovered connecting Nitsche to\n\fthe crime scenes near 2768 Loop Drive or 8201 Madison Avenue or the shootings of\n\nDean or McDowell.\n\n       {¶34}   At the close of the state’s case, Nitsche moved for acquittal on all counts\n\nof the indictment pursuant to Crim.R. 29(A), arguing that the state had failed to prove\n\nNitsche’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to any of the counts. The trial court\n\ngranted the motion as to Counts 4 and 12, discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited\n\npremises, and denied the motion as to the remaining counts.\n\n       {¶35} No witnesses testified for the defense.     After the defense rested, Nitsche\n\nrenewed his Crim.R. 29(A) motion as to the remaining counts of the indictment. The\n\ntrial court denied the motion and after receiving instructions from the trial court, the jury\n\nbegan its deliberations.\n\n       {¶36} With respect to the counts related to the shooting of McDowell, the jury\n\nfound Nitsche guilty of aggravated murder (Count 1), murder (Count 2) and felonious\n\nassault (Count 3) along with the associated firearm specifications. With respect to the\n\ncounts related to the shooting of Dean, the jury found Nitsche guilty of attempted murder\n\n(Count 6), felonious assault (Counts 7 and 8), aggravated robbery in violation of R.C.\n\n2911.01(A)(1) (Count 9) and the associated firearm specifications but not guilty of\n\naggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(3) (Count 10).            The trial court\n\nfound Nitsche guilty of the two having weapons while under disability counts (Counts 5\n\nand 11). Following the verdicts, Nitsche renewed his motion for acquittal pursuant to\n\fCrim.R. 29(C). Once again, the trial court denied the motion and immediately proceeded\n\nwith sentencing.\n\n       {¶37} Nitsche’s convictions for aggravated murder, murder and felonious assault\n\nmerged for sentencing and the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the aggravated\n\nmurder count. The one-year and three-year firearm specifications associated with each\n\nof the counts merged into a single three-year firearm specification. On the aggravated\n\nmurder count, the trial court imposed a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of\n\nparole plus three years for the firearm specification, to be served consecutively.\n\nNitsche’s convictions for attempted murder and felonious assault merged for sentencing\n\nand the state elected to proceed to sentencing on the attempted murder count. The\n\none-year firearm specifications on the attempted murder and aggravated robbery counts\n\nmerged into the three-year firearm specifications for each count.           The trial court\n\nsentenced Nitsche to 11 years on the attempted murder count and three years on the\n\nassociated firearm specification, to be served consecutively, three years on the aggravated\n\nrobbery count, to be served concurrently with the sentence on the attempted murder count\n\nand another three years on the firearm specification associated with the aggravated\n\nrobbery charge, to be served consecutively to the sentences on the remaining counts.\n\nThe trial court also sentenced Nitsche to five years mandatory postrelease control. On\n\neach of the having weapons while under disability counts (Counts 5 and 11), the trial\n\ncourt imposed a sentence of 24 months, to be served concurrently to the sentences on the\n\nother counts.   Thus, Nitsche was sentenced to an aggregate prison sentence of life\n\fwithout the possibility of parole plus 20 years (11 years on the attempted murder count\n\nplus three consecutive three-year sentences on the three-year firearm specifications).1\n\n       {¶38} The trial court did not impose a fine and waived court costs “based on the\n\nindigency of the defendant.” However, the trial court ordered that Nitsche pay $2,880 in\n\nrestitution to McDowell’s family “for the funeral bill.”             Nitsche objected to the\n\n“restitution issue” but did not dispute the amount of the funeral expenses.\n\n       {¶39} This appeal followed. Nitsche has raised the following six assignments of\n\nerror for review:\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 1:\n       Six years for consecutive firearm specifications for aggravated robbery and\n       attempted murder in the shooting [of] Berry Dean is error.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 2:\n       The trial court erred in ordering restitution.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 3:\n       The court’s failure to consider Nitsche’s young age in imposing a sentence\n       of life without parole violates his Eighth Amendment protection against\n       cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 4:\n       The court erred in considering Nitsche’s alleged gang affiliation when\n       imposing sentence.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 5:\n       The manifest weight of the evidence was not established to allow for\n       convictions in any of the crimes in either incident.\n\n       ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NUMBER 6:\n\n\n\n       1\n        The firearm specifications associated with the having weapons while under disability count\nmerged with the firearm specifications associated with the aggravated murder count.\n\f      The trial court abused its discretion in joining, in one trial, the Berry Dean\n\n      and Lewaldon [sic] McDowell shooting incidents.\n\n      {¶40} For ease of discussion, we consider Nitsche’s assignments of error out of\n\norder and together where appropriate.\n\nLaw and Analysis\n\n      Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n\n      {¶41} We address Nitsche’s fifth assignment of error first.             In his fifth\n\nassignment of error, Nitsche claims that all of his convictions should be overturned\n\nbecause they were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶42} A manifest weight challenge attacks the credibility of the evidence\n\npresented and questions whether the state met its burden of persuasion.

Reversal on manifest weight grounds is reserved for the\n\n“‘exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.’”\n\nThompkins at 387, quoting Martin at 175. This is not that case.\n\n      {¶43} Nitsche does not explain why he contends his convictions are against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence other than to assert that the “cloudy and shaky testimony”\n\nof the “citizen witness[es]” offered by the state — i.e., Wylie, Jackson, Osborn, Dean and\n\nGoodwin — lacked credibility and should not have been believed by the jury. Nitsche\n\ncontends that because the state’s witnesses included “young people with extensive\n\ninvolvement with drug usage and the criminal justice system,” their testimony “lacked the\n\ncredibility that would allow the jury to ‘rely upon it in the most important of your\n\naffairs.’” Nitsche’s conclusory assertions that the witnesses who testified against him\n\nwere not credible are insufficient to establish that his convictions were against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶44} Simply because certain witnesses had criminal histories or admitted using\n\ndrugs or alcohol or to being “high” on the night of the incidents at issue does not mean\n\ftheir testimony could not be relied upon to convict Nitsche. See, e.g., State v. Wells, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 98388, 2013-Ohio-3722, ¶ 130 (credibility of witnesses in murder\n\ncase was left to the jury where witnesses admitted they were high on crack cocaine the\n\nday of the murder and had “extensive criminal histories”); State v. Medezma-Palomo, 8th\n\nDist. Cuyahoga No. 88711, 2007-Ohio-5723, ¶ 36-37 (fact that witnesses “were all\n\nconsuming crack cocaine and heroin on a daily basis” and that several of the state’s\n\nwitnesses had criminal records did not preclude the jury from finding their testimony to\n\nbe credible); State v. Petty, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 11AP-716 and 11AP-766,\n\n2012-Ohio-2989, ¶ 41 (fact that witnesses had criminal records and struggled with\n\nsubstance abuse did not render their testimony unreliable; jury could properly weigh\n\ninformation regarding witnesses’ criminal histories and drug use in determining how\n\nmuch credibility to give their testimony).\n\n       {¶45} Likewise, a defendant is not entitled to reversal on manifest weight grounds\n\nmerely because certain aspects of a witness’s testimony are not credible or were\n\ninconsistent or contradictory.   See, e.g., State v. Wade, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90029,\n\n2008-Ohio-4574, ¶ 38, citing State v. Asberry, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 04AP-1113,\n\n2005-Ohio-4547, ¶ 11.       The decision whether, and to what extent, to believe the\n\ntestimony of a particular witness is “within the peculiar competence of the factfinder, who\n\nhas seen and heard the witness.” State v. Johnson, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99822,\n\n2014-Ohio-494, ¶ 54.\n\f       {¶46} The witnesses answered questions regarding their criminal histories and\n\nalleged drug or alcohol use during their direct and cross-examinations. The jury heard\n\nJackson admit that she had been drinking and was intoxicated the night Dean was shot\n\nand heard Wiley admit that he had an extensive criminal record and had been with\n\nMcDowell “getting high” most of the day on which McDowell was shot. Defense\n\ncounsel brought the inconsistencies in the witnesses’ testimony, any questionable\n\ntestimony by the witnesses and any potential biases on the part of witnesses to the jury’s\n\nattention for their consideration.   The jury was able to judge the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses for themselves and was “free to believe all, some, or none of the testimony of\n\neach witness appearing before it.” State v. Malone, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101305,\n\n2015-Ohio-2150, ¶ 29, citing State v. Ellis, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 98538,\n\n2013-Ohio-1184, ¶ 18.\n\n       {¶47} Here, there was eyewitness testimony from persons present at the scene\n\nidentifying Nitsche as the shooter in each of the two incidents.       Jackson identified\n\nNitsche as the person who shot Dean. Wylie and Osborn identified Nitsche as the\n\nperson who shot McDowell. These witnesses were not strangers to Nitsche; they all\n\nknew him well. Jackson was Nitsche’s former girlfriend. Osborn testified that she\n\nknew Nitsche “from around Madison [Avenue]” and that he was at one time a friend and\n\n“associate.”   Wylie testified that he had known Nitsche since he was 11 or 13 years old.\n\nIn addition, Nitsche’s friend, Goodwin testified that Nitsche admitted to her after the\n\nshooting that he had shot McDowell. All four witnesses also testified as to Nitsche’s\n\fmotive for shooting Dean and McDowell — i.e., a jealous boyfriend (or ex-boyfriend)\n\nseeking vengeance against the new man with whom his girlfriend, allegedly pregnant with\n\nhis child, had begun a relationship.\n\n        {¶48} After a careful review of the record in its entirety, we cannot say that this is\n\none of those “exceptional cases” in which the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created\n\nsuch a manifest miscarriage of justice that Nitsche’s convictions were against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence.

Accordingly, Nitsche’s fifth\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n        {¶49} We now turn to Nitsche’s challenges to the sentences he received.\n        Challenge to Imposition of Consecutive Sentences on Firearm Specifications\n        Associated with Attempted Murder and Aggravated Robbery Charges\n\n        {¶50} In his first assignment of error, Nitsche contends that the trial court erred in\n\nimposing consecutive three-year sentences on the three-year firearm specifications\n\nassociated with Nitsche’s convictions for attempted murder and aggravated robbery in\n\nconnection with the shooting of Dean.\n\n        {¶51} Nitsche acknowledges that this court has previously held that R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) “allow[s] for multiple, consecutive firearm specifications to be imposed\n\nfor a single incident.” See, e.g., State v. Lawrence, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 100371 and\n\n100387, 2014-Ohio-4797, ¶ 12-16.        However, he asks this court to reconsider its prior\n\ndecisions and consider “the equities of imposing multiple firearm convictions for a single\n\nact.”   He further argues that “at the very least, a court should be required to undertake\n\fconsecutive sentencing analysis and justification” pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C) before\n\nimposing consecutive firearm specifications under R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g). This court\n\nhas already considered and rejected these arguments.      Nitsche provides no justification\n\nfor revisiting them here.\n\n       {¶52}   Ordinarily, a trial court is prohibited from imposing more than one prison\n\nterm for firearm specifications associated with felonies “committed as part of the same\n\nact or transaction.”   R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(b).    However, R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) creates\n\nan exception that mandates the imposition of consecutive prison terms where a defendant\n\nis convicted of multiple firearm specifications under certain circumstances.          State v.\n\nYoung,   8th   Dist.   Cuyahoga     No.   102202,    2015-Ohio-2862,      ¶   8-10.      R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) provides:\n\n       If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to two or more felonies, if one\n       or more of those felonies are aggravated murder, murder, attempted\n       aggravated murder, attempted murder, aggravated robbery, felonious\n       assault, or rape, and if the offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a\n       specification of the type described under division (B)(1)(a) of this section [a\n       specification of the type described in R.C. 2941.141, 2941.144, or\n       2941.145], in connection with two or more of the felonies, the sentencing\n       court shall impose on the offender the prison term specified under division\n       (B)(1)(a) of this section for each of the two most serious specifications of\n       which the offender is convicted or to which the offender pleads guilty and,\n       in its discretion, also may impose on the offender the prison term specified\n       under that division for any or all of the remaining specifications.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n       {¶53} This court has construed R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) to mean that in cases such\n\nas this, where the defendant was found guilty of two or more felonies (one of which was\n\nattempted murder) and those felony counts included firearm specifications — of which\n\fthe defendant was also convicted — the trial court is required to impose prison terms for\n\nthe two most serious specifications and could also, in its discretion, impose a sentence for\n\nany other specification.        State v. James, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102604,\n\n2015-Ohio-4987, ¶ 41. This court has stated that although the General Assembly did not\n\nuse the word “consecutive” in R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g), R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) nevertheless\n\ncreated an exception to the general rule that a trial court may not impose multiple,\n\nconsecutive firearm specifications for crimes committed as part of the same act or\n\ntransaction. See Young at ¶ 9, citing State v. Vanderhorst, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n97242, 2013-Ohio-1785, ¶ 10. As this court has explained:\n\n        “The mandatory language of the statute (‘the court shall impose’) also\n        indicates the General Assembly’s intention that the defendant serve multiple\n        sentences for firearm specifications associated with the enumerated crimes,\n        such as [attempted murder, aggravated robbery] or felonious assault. Had\n        the legislature intended a per se rule that sentences for firearm\n        specifications must be served concurrent with one another, it could have\n        stated as much. Or, the legislature could have chosen not to codify R.C.\n        2929.14(B)(1)(g), which serves as an exception to the rule that multiple\n        firearm specifications must be merged for purposes of sentencing when the\n        predicate offenses were committed as a single criminal transaction.”\n\nYoung at ¶ 9, quoting Vanderhorst at ¶ 10, quoting State v. Isreal, 12th Dist. Warren No.\n\nCA2011-11-115, 2012-Ohio-4876, ¶ 71; see also Lawrence, 2014-Ohio-4797, at ¶ 14.\n\n        {¶54} In this case Nitsche was convicted of attempted murder, aggravated robbery\n\nand felonious assault— among other offenses — in connection with the shooting of Berry\n\nDean.    Each of those counts carried a one-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C.\n\n2941.141(A) and a three-year firearm specification pursuant to R.C. 2941.145(A), and\n\nupon which the jury convicted.       The trial court was, therefore, mandated by R.C.\n\f2929.14(B)(1)(g) to impose sentences “for each of the two most serious specifications of\n\nwhich the offender is convicted,” i.e., two of the three-year firearm specifications,\n\nconsecutively. Young at ¶ 10; Lawrence at ¶ 14; Vanderhorst at ¶ 10.        Because R.C.\n\n2929.14(B)(1)(g) requires the imposition of consecutive sentences for the firearm\n\nspecifications, the trial court was not required to make R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) findings\n\nbefore imposing multiple, consecutive three-year sentences on the firearm specifications\n\nassociated with Counts 6 and 9. Young at ¶ 10, citing State v. A.H., 8th Dist. Cuyahoga\n\nNo. 98622, 2013-Ohio-2525, ¶ 21.     “[T]he mandatory requirement to order consecutive\n\nservice of certain specifications under R.C. 2929.14(B)(1)(g) supersedes the findings\n\nrequired by R.C. 2929.14(C)(4).”    James at ¶ 46.\n\n       {¶55} Furthermore, R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) “applies to ‘multiple prison terms [that]\n\nare imposed on an offender for convictions of multiple offenses[.]’”                 R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4).   A specification is a sentencing enhancement, not a separate criminal\n\noffense.   Thus, “[b]y its own terms, R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) does not apply to penalty\n\nenhancing specifications.” James at ¶ 47.      Accordingly, the trial court did not err in\n\nconvicting Nitsche of multiple three-year firearm specifications on the attempted murder\n\nand aggravated robbery counts or in imposing consecutive sentences for those firearm\n\nspecification convictions without making R.C. 2929.14(C)(4) findings. Nitsche’s first\n\nassignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Challenges to Sentence on Aggravated Murder Charge\n\f       {¶56} In his third and fourth assignments of error, Nitsche challenges the prison\n\nsentence of life without parole that the trial court imposed on the aggravated murder\n\ncount. In his third assignment of error, Nitsche claims that the trial court violated his\n\nEighth Amendment rights by sentencing him to life without the possibility of parole “due\n\nto his young age” or “at the very least” by not “acknowledg[ing] that his age was\n\nconsidered in the analysis of a just sentence.”   In his fourth assignment of error, Nitsche\n\ncontends that the trial court erred in considering his alleged gang affiliation in imposing a\n\nlife sentence without parole.   Nitsche’s arguments are meritless.\n\n       Whether the Trial Court Violated the Eighth Amendment by Imposing a Life\n       Sentence Without Parole Given Nitsche’s “Young Age”\n\n       {¶57} Nitsche’s constitutional challenge to his life sentence without parole on the\n\naggravated murder count is based on Miller v.

Miller at 2464. In Roper, the United States Supreme Court held that the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit imposition of the death penalty on offenders\n\nwho were under the age of 18 when their crimes were committed.           Roper at 578. In\n\nLong, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a trial court, in exercising its sentencing\n\ndiscretion for aggravated murder under R.C. 2929.03(A), “must separately consider the\n\fyouth of a juvenile offender as a mitigating factor before imposing a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole” and that “[t]he record must reflect that the court specifically considered\n\nthe juvenile offender’s youth as a mitigating factor at sentencing when a prison term of\n\nlife without parole is imposed.’” Long at paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.\n\n       {¶59} Nitsche asserts that the same considerations that led the courts in these cases\n\nto conclude that juveniles “‘are less deserving of the most severe punishments,’” Miller at\n\n2464, quoting Graham v.

The Ohio Supreme Court relied on Miller in reaching its decision\n\nin Long.   Long at ¶ 1, 11-14.\n\f       {¶61}       Nitsche, however, is not a “juvenile offender.”   He was 23 years of age\n\nand had been an adult for five years at the time he committed the crimes at issue.\n\nTherefore, the considerations identified in Miller (and the other cases cited above) —\n\nwhich are based on the “significant gaps between juveniles and adults,” Miller at 2464\n\n— do not apply here.\n\n       {¶62}       The Tenth District recently considered a similar argument in State v.\n\nPhipps, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 15AP-524, 2016-Ohio-663. In that case, the defendant\n\n— who was 19 at the time he committed the offenses at issue — pled guilty to 21 counts,\n\nincluding aggravated robbery and kidnapping, arising out of a series of robberies,\n\nburglaries and home invasions.      Id. at ¶ 3, 35.   He was sentenced to an aggregate prison\n\nterm of 150 years. Id. at ¶ 3.        The defendant argued, based on Miller, Graham and\n\nRoper, that the trial court erred in failing to consider his “relative youth” as a relevant\n\nfactor under R.C. 2929.12 and that his youth should have been considered during\n\nsentencing because “he lacked * * * maturity and had an underdeveloped sense of\n\nresponsibility.” Id. at ¶ 33, 35.     The Tenth District rejected the defendant’s argument,\n\nnoting that there was no authority to support the extension of Roper, Graham and Miller\n\nto the defendant, who was not a juvenile at the time he committed the offenses at issue.\n\nId. at ¶ 37, 39.    As the court explained:\n\n       We are unaware of, and appellant fails to point to, any pertinent legal\n       authority to support the extension of Roper, Graham, and Miller to persons\n       who were not juveniles at the time of the commission of the offense. * * *\n       [I]n Roper, Graham, and Miller, the United States Supreme Court explicitly\n       referred to the age of 18 as the divide between juveniles and adults when\n       considering developmental differences under the Eighth Amendment. * * *\n\f       The United States Supreme Court explained its use of the age of 18 to\n       establish the divide as follows:\n\n       Drawing the line at 18 years of age is subject, of course, to the objections\n       always raised against categorical rules. The qualities that distinguish\n       juveniles from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. By the\n       same token, some under 18 have already attained a level of maturity some\n       adults will never reach. For the reasons we have discussed, however, a line\n       must be drawn. * * * The age of 18 is the point where society draws the line\n       for many purposes between childhood and adulthood.\n       Roper at 574.\n\n       Following Miller, the Sixth Circuit considered whether to extend Miller to\n       persons over the age of 18. United States v. Marshall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th\n       Cir.2013). The court found that “[c]onsiderations of efficiency and certainty\n       require a bright line separating adults from juveniles” and that “[f]or\n       purposes of the Eighth Amendment, an individual’s eighteenth birthday\n       marks that bright line.” Id. at 500. * * *\n\n       [O]n the facts of this case, we cannot agree that the trial court erred by\n       refusing to consider appellant’s age through extension of the holdings in\n       Roper, Graham, and Miller in the determination of his sentence.\n\nPhipps at ¶ 37-40; see also State v. Rolland, 7th Dist. Mahoning No. 12 MA 68,\n\n2013-Ohio-2950, ¶ 15 (“Roper, Graham and Miller are inapplicable” to a defendant who\n\nwas not a juvenile at the time of the commission of the offense because the protections at\n\nissue in those cases “apply only to juvenile offenders.”)\n\n       {¶63}   Like the defendant in Phipps, Nitsche “offers no persuasive justification\n\nfor the extension of the reasoning” in Roper, Miller and Long to the facts of this case.\n\nId. at ¶ 39. Although this case involves a sentence of life without the possibility of\n\nparole rather than a lengthy aggregate prison sentence, we believe the same reasoning\n\napplies. Nitsche’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole does\n\nnot violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\f       {¶64}    Furthermore, even if the trial court was constitutionally required to\n\nconsider Nitsche’s age prior to sentencing him to life without parole, the transcript from\n\nthe sentencing hearing reflects that it did so.   The trial court specifically noted during the\n\nsentencing hearing that “at the defendant’s young age of now 25 he had already several\n\nprior criminal convictions.”      Specifically, the court found that the appellant was\n\nconvicted in 2011 for domestic violence and attempted abduction and was sentenced to a\n\n12– month prison term; in 2009 he was sentenced to a two year term of imprisonment for\n\nreceiving stolen property of a motor vehicle and failure to comply with an order signal of\n\na police officer, and in 2008, after violating the terms of probation for a charge of\n\ntrafficking controlled substance, he was sentenced to a term of six months. Accordingly,\n\nNitsche’s third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Consideration of Nitsche’s Gang Affiliation During Sentencing\n\n       {¶65} In addition to his constitutional challenge, Nitsche argues that the trial court\n\nerred in considering his “alleged gang affiliation” when sentencing Nitsche on the\n\naggravated murder count.        Nitsche contends that the trial court made it clear at\n\nsentencing that “the reason” it imposed a sentence of life without parole on the\n\naggravated murder charge was because Nitsche was a member of the “Heartless Felons”\n\ngang “even though there was no evidence/testimony in the case about that issue.”           He\n\nfurther asserts that Nitsche’s “conduct in the crimes alleged does not explain the sentence\n\nhe received” and that the trial court’s imposition of a sentence of life without parole was\n\f“unsubstantiated, unjustified, and an abuse of discretion.” We have no authority to\n\nreview Nitsche’s sentence on this basis.\n\n      {¶66} R.C. 2953.08 governs the review of felony sentences. R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)\n\nprovides: “A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder pursuant to sections\n\n2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review under this section.”\n\nThus, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) expressly “excludes sentences imposed for aggravated murder\n\n* * * from appellate review.”           State v. White, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101576,\n\n2015-Ohio-2387, ¶ 67-68 (defendant’s claim that sentences imposed on murder and\n\naggravated murder counts were contrary to law because trial court did not engage in a\n\nproportionality analysis was not subject to appellate review under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)),\n\nciting State v.

Nitsche was sentenced for aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2929.02(A)\n\nand 2929.03. Accordingly, R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) applies.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Neither Nitsche nor the state addressed the applicability of R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) in their briefs.\n\f       {¶67} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) is\n\n“unambiguous” and “clearly means what it says: such a sentence cannot be reviewed.”\n\nPorterfield at ¶ 17; see also Jackson at ¶ 61-64 (rejecting defendant’s claim that trial\n\ncourt failed to consider his mental illness as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.12,\n\nnoting that “evidentiary review of a sentence imposed by a trial court pursuant to R.C.\n\n2929.03(A)(1)(a) is precluded”); State v. Hilliard, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102214,\n\n2015-Ohio-3142, ¶ 29-31 (defendant’s claim that he was remorseful and had no prior\n\ncriminal record, that his crime “stemmed from a failed relationship that seemed to have\n\nprovoked [his] behavior” and that unspecified mitigating factors revealed in his\n\npsychological examination warranted a lesser sentence was not subject to appellate\n\nreview under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3)); State v.

Gallia No. 13CA3,\n\n2014-Ohio-1224, ¶ 10, 13-15 (appellate court lacked statutory authority to consider\n\ndefendant’s argument that sentence for aggravated murder was “unreasonable” because\n\nhe “lived a primarily law-abiding life,” was “a ‘quiet, hard-working, decent person’” and\n\nhis actions against victim were “an aberration from his normal, quiet self” under R.C.\n\n2953.08(D)(3)); State v.

Patterson, 5th Dist. Stark No. 2012CA00098, 2013-Ohio-1647, ¶ 70 (same).\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to R.C. 2953.08(D)(3), we lack statutory authority to review\n\nNitsche’s sentence for aggravated murder on an evidentiary basis.\n\f       {¶68} Even if R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) were not a bar to review, we would still find no\n\nerror in the trial court’s consideration of Nitsche’s gang affiliation here.   Nitsche has not\n\ncited any authority in support of his claim that the trial court erred in considering his ties\n\nto the Heartless Felons gang when sentencing him. Nitsche does not dispute that he is a\n\nmember of the Heartless Felons gang and did not object when the trial court referred to\n\nhis gang affiliation during sentencing. In fact, the defense filed a motion in time to\n\nprohibit the state from “revealing any information that the defendant is gang affiliated\n\nwith a group known as the ‘heartless felons.’” The motion was granted. There was ample\n\nevidence in the record, however regarding Nitsche’s ties to the Heartless Felons gang\n\nfrom a pretrial hearing that the trial court held on the state’s motion to revoke Nitsche’s\n\nnon-attorney phone, visitation and mail privileges while in jail after Nitsche posed for an\n\nillicit in-jail photograph.3\n\n       {¶69} Furthermore, it is clear from the record that Nitsche’s affiliation with the\n\nHeartless Felons gang was only one of many factors the trial court considered in imposing\n\nhis sentence. The trial court’s reference to Nitsche’s gang affiliation followed a detailed\n\ndiscussion of Nitsche’s criminal history, the reprehensibility of his conduct, his lack of\n\nconcern for human life, the danger he posed to the public, his failure to take responsibility\n\nfor his actions and his lack of remorse. As the trial court explained:\n\n\n\n       3\n         The photograph — in which Nitsche flashed Heartless Felons gang signs\nwith his hands — had been posted to social media by a third party with the caption:\n“If all my reall 1st n***** out u wouldn’t even be able to brush my shoulders free\nyellow he say don’t let them n***** breath out ther.” Sic.\n\fThe Court has considered the record, and certainly the record includes the\ntrial of this matter where the Court had first-hand knowledge of the\ntestimony and the evidence presented against Mr. Nitsche and upon which\nthe jury itself found him guilty as previously noted.\n\nThe Court has considered the oral statements made here today and the Court\nhas considered the purposes and principles of sentencing under Revised\nCode Section 2929.11 and the seriousness and recidivism factors relevant to\nthe offense and offender pursuant to Revised Code Section 2929.12, the\nneed for deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation, and restitution.\n\nTo begin with, the Court would like to record the defendant’s criminal\nhistory * * *. So at the defendant’s young age of now 25, he has already\nseveral prior convictions, criminal convictions. * * *\n\n[W]ith regard to the aggravated murder, Count 1, just finding out that Mr.\nMcDowell was the person who you believed then was actually seeing Mary\nAnn Jackson, within a matter of hours, if that, you decided to go and kill\nhim, walk right up to him in front of his friends and shoot him in the chest.\nThen, according to the testimony of the witnesses, Karen and Don Don, you\npointed the gun at them, and but for it jamming, you may have very well\nseriously injured or killed those other individuals who were there with him.\n\nYour conduct is reprehensible. It is despicable. You have no concern for\nhuman life. That’s absolutely been shown. Absolutely no concern for\nhuman life. You are a danger to the public, and I have a sworn duty to\nprotect the public. Again, no remorse. * * *\n\nAnd even though it did not come out in the trial, you are a Heartless Felon.\nYou are proud of being a Heartless Felon. You give the signs of being a\nHeartless Felon. You are tattooed with it. This is who you are, which is\nwhy I restricted your communications in jail. You take pride in being a\nHeartless Felon. And you try to impart fear in others that cross you.\n\nAnd it’s for that reason that on the count of aggravated murder, the Court is\n\nimposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole *\n\n* * *.\n\f       {¶70} Nitsche was convicted of aggravated murder in violation of R.C.\n\n2903.01(A), which carries, in this case, a life sentence. R.C. 2929.02(A). Pursuant to\n\nR.C. 2929.03(A)(1)(a)-(d), the life sentence could be without parole eligibility or with\n\nparole eligibility after serving 20, 25 or 30 years in prison. In this case, Nitsche was\n\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Nitsche does not dispute\n\nthat his sentence falls within the statutory range for aggravated murder.   Nitsche’s prison\n\nsentence is supported by the record and is not contrary to law.     Accordingly, Nitsche’s\n\nfourth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       Restitution\n\n       {¶71} In his second assignment of error, Nitsche argues that the trial court erred in\n\nordering him to pay restitution to McDowell’s family for the costs of his funeral.\n\n       {¶72} As an initial matter, we must first consider whether we have authority to\n\nreview the trial court’s restitution order under R.C. 2953.08(D)(3).        As stated above,\n\nR.C. 2953.08(D)(3) provides: “A sentence imposed for aggravated murder or murder\n\npursuant to sections 2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code is not subject to review\n\nunder this section.”     R.C. 2929.01(FF) defines a “sentence” as “the sanction or\n\ncombination of sanctions imposed by the sentencing court on an offender who is\n\nconvicted of or pleads guilty to an offense.” A “sanction” is “any penalty imposed upon\n\nan offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to an offense, as punishment for the\n\noffense” and “includes any sanction imposed pursuant to any provision of sections\n\n2929.14 to 2929.18 * * * of the Revised Code.” R.C. 2929.01(DD). Applying these\n\fdefinitions, “sentence” as used in R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) encompasses restitution.\n\nRestitution is not, however, part of Nitsche’s sentence imposed “pursuant to sections\n\n2929.02 to 2929.06 of the Revised Code.” Restitution is authorized pursuant to R.C.\n\n2929.18.    Accordingly, we conclude that R.C. 2953.08(D)(3) does not preclude our\n\nreview of the trial court’s restitution order in this case.\n\n       {¶73} We review a trial court’s decision to order restitution for abuse of discretion.\n\n State v.

Marcum, Slip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-1002, ¶ 1, the Ohio Supreme Court, in\n“address[ing] the standard of review that appellate courts must apply when reviewing felony\nsentences,” recently stated that when “[a]pplying the plain language of R.C. 2953.08(G)(2), * * * an\nappellate court may vacate or modify a felony sentence on appeal only if it determines by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the record does not support the trial court’s findings under relevant statutes\nor that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.” The court’s application of R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) in\nMarcum was limited to sentencing-term challenges. See id. at ¶ 7, 10 (“[W]e hold that appellate\ncourts may not apply the abuse-of-discretion standard in sentencing-term challenges.”) Prior to\nMarcum, this court applied R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) in reviewing sentencing-term challenges and applied\nan abuse of discretion standard in reviewing challenges to restitution orders. See, e.g., State v.\nMaddox, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99120, 2013-Ohio-3140, ¶ 23, 53; compare State v.

(holding that “R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) is the proper\nstandard of review for all felony sentences” and that, therefore, the “proper standard of review for\nanalyzing the imposition of restitution as a part of a felony sentence is whether the sentence complies\nwith R.C. 2953.08(G)(2)(b)”). Since Marcum was decided, this court has continued to apply an\nabuse of discretion standard in reviewing restitution orders. See Maurer at ¶ 12. Accordingly, we\napply an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing Nitsche’s challenge to the restitution order in this\ncase. Even if, however, the standard of review set forth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) applied, it would not\nchange the result here.\n\f       {¶74} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), a trial court may order an offender to pay\n\nrestitution to the victim’s family “in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss” as\n\npart of a felony sentence.   R.C. 2929.18(A)(1) provides, in relevant part:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this division and in addition to imposing\n       court costs pursuant to section 2947.23 of the Revised Code, the court\n       imposing a sentence upon an offender for a felony may sentence the\n       offender to any financial sanction or combination of financial sanctions\n       authorized under this section * * * Financial sanctions that may be imposed\n       pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n       (1)   Restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or any\n\n       survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the victim’s economic loss. *\n\n       * * If the court imposes restitution, at sentencing, the court shall determine\n\n       the amount of restitution to be made by the offender. If the court imposes\n\n       restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an\n\n       amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence\n\n       investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or\n\n       replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the\n\n       court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss\n\n       suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of\n\n       the offense.

However, he argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay\n\n$2,880 restitution for McDowell’s funeral expenses because (1) the state offered no\n\n“documentary proof” of McDowell’s funeral bill at sentencing and (2) the trial court\n\ffailed to consider his “present or future ability to pay” restitution prior to ordering\n\nrestitution.\n\n       {¶78} Prior to ordering restitution, “a sentencing court must engage in a ‘due\n\nprocess ascertainment that the amount of restitution bears a reasonable relationship to the\n\nloss suffered.’”   McLaurin, 2016-Ohio-933, at ¶ 13, quoting State v. Borders, 12th Dist.\n\nClermont No. CA2004-12-101, 2005-Ohio-4339, ¶ 36. “The court must determine the\n\namount of restitution to a reasonable degree of certainty, ensuring that the amount is\n\nsupported by competent, credible evidence.” McLaurin at ¶ 13, citing State v.

Pursuant to R.C. 2929.18(A)(1), if the\n\ncourt imposes restitution, it\n\n       “may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended\n       by the victim, * * * estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or\n       replacing property, and other information, provided that the amount the\n       court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss\n       suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of\n       the offense.” A hearing on the issue of restitution need only be held “if\n       the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount.”\nId.\n\n       {¶79} In this case, the state submitted a receipt at sentencing evidencing the\n\namount — $2,880 — McDowell’s family paid for his funeral. It does not appear,\n\nhowever, that the state asked to have the receipt admitted into evidence as an exhibit at\n\nthe sentencing hearing and it is not part of the record on appeal.   Nitsche, however, did\n\nnot dispute the amount paid for McDowell’s funeral at the sentencing hearing.\n\nAccordingly, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in ordering that $2,880 be\n\fpaid for McDowell’s funeral expenses — notwithstanding that the receipt was not\n\nadmitted as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing.\n\n       {¶80}   Nitsche also argues that the restitution order should be vacated because the\n\nonly information before the trial court regarding his present or future ability to pay when\n\nit ordered restitution was the fact that he was indigent and had court-appointed counsel.\n\n       {¶81} R.C. 2929.19(B)(5) “‘imposes a duty upon the trial court ‘to consider the\n\noffender’s present or future ability to pay’ before imposing any financial sanctions under\n\nR.C. 2929.18.’” State v. Aniton, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102440, 2015-Ohio-4080, ¶ 19,\n\nquoting State v. Tate, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25386, 2013-Ohio-5167, ¶ 52. R.C.\n\n2929.19(B)(5) states: “Before imposing a financial sanction under section 2929.18 of the\n\nRevised Code or a fine under section 2929.32 of the Revised Code, the court shall\n\nconsider the offender’s present and future ability to pay the amount of the sanction or\n\nfine.” As this court previously explained, in fulfilling that duty:\n\n       “The statute does not require that the trial court consider any specific\n       factors when determining a defendant’s present or future ability to pay\n       financial sanctions. Nor does the statute require a hearing on the matter.\n       The court is also ‘not required to expressly state that it considered a\n       defendant’s ability to pay * * *.’ ‘The record should, however, contain\n       “evidence that the trial court considered the offender’s present and future\n       ability to pay before imposing the sanction of restitution.’” * * * ‘The\n       court’s consideration * * * may [also] be inferred from the record under\n       appropriate circumstances.’”\n\nAniton at ¶ 19, quoting Tate at ¶ 52; see also State v. Betliskey, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No.\n\n101330, 2015-Ohio-1821, ¶ 42, 44 (describing what is required in considering ability to\n\npay as a “low threshold”).    “A trial court need not explicitly state in its judgment entry\n\fthat it considered a defendant’s ability to pay a financial sanction. Rather, courts look to\n\nthe totality of the record to see if this requirement has been satisfied.” State v. Lewis,\n\n8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 90413, 2008-Ohio-4101, ¶ 12.\n\n       {¶82} At sentencing, defense counsel stated that Nitsche had filed an affidavit of\n\nindigency, “is indigent as this point[,] * * * is unable to pay any fines or costs at this\n\nparticular point in time and has been declared indigent by the Court of Common Pleas by\n\nvirtue of [the] appointments [of counsel].”   No presentence investigation was conducted.\n\n There is no information in the record regarding Nitsche’s employment history,\n\neducation, skills, assets or present or future income sources and the sentencing entry does\n\nnot state that the trial court considered Nitsche’s ability to pay restitution. On the basis\n\nof defense counsel’s statements, the trial judge stated: “I’m not imposing any fine. I’m\n\nwaiving court costs based upon the indigency of the defendant. But I am ordering\n\nrestitution to the victim’s family for the funeral bill in the amount of $2,880.”\n\nConsidering the totality of the record in this case, although there is some indication —\n\nbased on the trial court’s reference to Nitsche’s indigency — that the trial court\n\nconsidered Nitsche’s present ability (or rather, inability) to pay restitution, there is\n\nnothing in the record that indicates whether the trial court considered Nitsche’s future\n\nability to pay restitution, as required under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). Given that Nitsche was\n\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, we cannot infer that the trial\n\ncourt considered Nitsche’s future ability to pay when it ordered restitution.      See, e.g.,\n\nState v. Russell, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23454, 2010-Ohio-4765, ¶ 62-64 (appellate\n\fcourt could not infer that the trial court considered defendant’s future ability to pay\n\nrestitution of more than $15,000 where defendant was sentenced to 40 and one-half years\n\nto life in prison and would be approximately 70 years old, at least, if he was ever released\n\nfrom prison); State v. Napper, 4th Dist. Ross No. 06CA2885, 2006-Ohio-6614, ¶ 15-17\n\n(vacating restitution order where it was “unclear” how indigent defendant with no assets\n\nand a prison sentence of 51 years to life would have “the future ability to pay the victim’s\n\nfamily”); compare Aniton, 2015-Ohio-4080, ¶ 21 (trial court complied with its obligation\n\nto consider defendant’s ability to pay restitution order where it considered presentence\n\ninvestigation report and noted that defendant, who had been sentenced to 21 years in\n\nprison, would “hav[e] 21 years in prison to pay off those costs”). The trial court,\n\ntherefore, abused its discretion in ordering restitution.\n\n       {¶83}    Accordingly, we sustain Nitsche’s second assignment of error, in part, and\n\noverrule it, in part. Since Nitsche did not dispute the amount of restitution ordered at\n\nsentencing, we reverse the restitution order and remand this matter to the trial court for\n\nconsideration of Nitsche’s present and future ability to pay the $2,880 in restitution\n\npreviously ordered.      See, e.g., State v. Graves, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 99141,\n\n2013-Ohio-2911, ¶ 13-15 (where there was no evidence that trial court considered\n\ndefendant’s present and future ability to pay prior to imposing $2,000 fine, trial court’s\n\nimposition of fine and case remanded for a determination of defendant’s present and\n\nfuture ability to pay fine); see also Western, 2015-Ohio-627, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶ 57, 59.\n\n       Joinder of Counts Involving the Two Shootings\n\f       {¶84} In his sixth and final assignment of error, Nitsche argues that the trial court\n\nerred in denying his motion to sever the claims related to the shooting of McDowell from\n\nthose involving the shooting of Dean.\n\n       {¶85} Under Crim.R. 8(A), two or more offenses may be charged together if the\n\noffenses “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction,\n\nor are based on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts\n\nof a common scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.” Ohio law\n\n“‘favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial’” if the requirements for joinder under\n\nCrim.R. 8(A) are met.

First, “if in\n\nseparate trials the state could introduce evidence of the joined offenses as ‘other acts’\n\nunder Evid.R. 404(B), a defendant cannot claim prejudice from the joinder” — the “other\n\nacts” test. Dean at ¶ 61, citing Lott at 163. Evid.R. 404(B) recognizes that evidence of\n\nother crimes may be admissible for purposes such as “proof of motive, opportunity,\n\nintent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.” If one\n\noffense could be introduced under Evid.R. 404(B) at the trial of the other offense, had the\n\noffenses been tried separately, “any ‘prejudice that might result from the jury’s hearing\n\nthe evidence of the other crime in a joint trial would be no different from that possible in\n\nseparate trials,’ and a court need not inquire further.” Schaim, 65 Ohio St.3d at 59, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, quoting Drew v.

Second,\n\n[“the state can refute prejudice by showing that] ‘evidence of each crime joined at trial is\n\nsimple and direct’” — the “joinder test.” Dean at ¶ 61, quoting Lott at 163. Where\n\nevidence of the joined offenses is “uncomplicated,” such that the jury is “capable of\n\nsegregating the proof” required to prove each offense, a defendant is not prejudiced by\n\njoinder. State v. Lunder, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 101223, 2014-Ohio-5341, ¶ 33 (“A\n\ntrier of fact is believed capable of segregating the proof on multiple charges when the\n\nevidence as to each of the charges is uncomplicated.”); State v.

The\n\nvery essence of the rule is that the evidence be such that the jury is unlikely to be\n\nconfused by it or misuse it.’” Echols, 2015-Ohio-5138, at ¶ 16, quoting State v.

See, e.g., State v. Dantzler, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 14AP-907 and\n\n14AP-908, 2015-Ohio-3641, ¶ 23; State v. Morales, 10th Dist.

Thus, if the state can meet the\n\n“simple and direct” test, it need not meet the “stricter” “other acts” test.           Echols,\n\n2015-Ohio-5138, at ¶ 11 (a defendant is “not prejudiced by joinder when simple and\n\ndirect evidence exists, regardless of the admissibility of evidence of other crimes under\n\nEvid.R. 404(B)”).\n\n       {¶90} This court normally reviews a trial court’s decision on joinder for an abuse\n\nof discretion.

In reviewing the evidence in this case, we find\n\nno prejudice to Nitsche as a result of the joinder of the offenses.\n\n       {¶93}    The offenses relating to the shooting of Dean and the shooting of\n\nMcDowell were charged together because they were of the “same or similar character”\n\nand part of “a common scheme or plan” or “course of criminal conduct” occurring over a\n\nrelatively short period of time. Nitsche shot Dean because he believed (or rather Jackson\n\fled him to believe) that Dean was the “other man” Jackson had been seeing while she was\n\npurportedly in an “exclusive” relationship with Nitsche. Within hours of Jackson’s\n\nidentification of Dean, Nitsche lured Dean to Jackson’s apartment and, as soon as Dean\n\nappeared, Nitsche snuck up behind him and shot him at close range in the back with a\n\nsingle shot. When Nitsche learned that Dean was not, in fact, the man Jackson had been\n\nseeing and that the “other man” was actually McDowell, Nitsche then targeted\n\nMcDowell. Within hours after Nitsche learned that McDowell had been seeing Jackson,\n\nNitsche located McDowell, approached him and shot him at close range in the chest with\n\na single shot.\n\n       {¶94} The trial court instructed the jury to consider each count separately:\n\n       The charges set forth in each count in the indictment constitute a separate\n\n       and distinct matter.

The\n\n       defendant may be found guilty or not guilty of any one or all of the offenses\n\n       charged.\n\n       {¶95} We presume that the jury followed the court’s instructions.

There is nothing in the record to\n\nsuggest that the jury confused the evidence as to the various counts or was improperly\n\n“influenced by the cumulative effect of the joinder.” Banks, 2015-Ohio-5413, at ¶ 66.\n\fTo the contrary, the record demonstrates that the jury considered each offense separately,\n\nfinding Nitsche not guilty of aggravated robbery in Count 10, while convicting him of the\n\nremaining offenses. See, e.g., id. at ¶ 66-68 (defendant was “unable to show that he was\n\nprejudiced by the trial court’s refusal to sever his offenses” where he was acquitted of\n\nsome charges and convicted of a lesser offense in others).\n\n       {¶96} Nitsche offers no evidence or information to support his claim that he was\n\nprejudiced by the jury’s consideration of the offenses relating to McDowell’s murder and\n\nthe shooting and paralysis of Dean in a single trial. Nitsche’s bald allegations are\n\ninsufficient to establish prejudice. See, e.g., State v. Rosas, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n22424, 2009-Ohio-1404, ¶ 48 (defendant did not meet his burden of establishing\n\nprejudice for purposes of motion to sever where defendant failed to provide “very much\n\ninformation to the trial court about how he was prejudiced” and nowhere explained how\n\nhis rights were allegedly prejudiced but “merely assert[ed] broad general allegations of\n\nprejudice that any defendant could assert”); see also State v. Corker, 10th Dist. Franklin\n\nNos. 13AP-264, 13AP-265, 13AP-266, 2013-Ohio-5446, ¶ 21, quoting State v. Strobel,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3724133\"><a href=\"/opinion/3972952/state-v-strobel/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3724133\"><a href=\"/opinion/3972952/state-v-strobel/\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Dist.1988) (rejecting defendant’s “bare\n\nassertions” of prejudice and noting that “‘there is always the possibility of prejudice in\n\njoining separate instances of any offense in the same indictment’” and that the defendant\n\nbears the burden to “‘either affirmatively demonstrate before trial that his rights would be\n\nprejudiced by the joinder, or to show at the close of the state’s case, or at the conclusion\n\nof all the evidence, that his rights actually had been prejudiced by the joinder’”).\n\f       {¶97} Nitsche allegedly committed both shootings due to jealously relating to his\n\ngirlfriend’s relationships with other men, and there were a number of common elements\n\nbetween the two shootings. As such, evidence relating to both shootings would have\n\nlikely been admissible at separate trials to prove Nitsche’s motive or identity by modus\n\noperandi under Evid.R. 404(B). Furthermore, the evidence related to each shooting was\n\n“separate and direct.”    Nitsche shot two different victims, at different locations, on\n\ndifferent dates. Different witnesses witnessed each of the shootings and separate police\n\nofficers from separate police departments investigated the two shootings, i.e., CMHA\n\npolice investigated the shooting of Dean and Cleveland police investigated the shooting\n\nof McDowell. Although Jackson provided testimony relevant to each of the shootings,\n\nshe witnessed only one of the shootings. Likewise, although the same forensic experts\n\ntestified regarding the testing of evidence relating to both shootings, the forensic evidence\n\noffered by the state was limited and was not so complicated as to result in confusion over\n\nwhich evidence related to which offense. Any claim of prejudice allegedly resulting\n\nfrom joinder of the offenses related to the two shootings was, therefore, rebutted by the\n\nstate under the “other acts” or “joinder” tests.\n\n       {¶98}    Further, claims of prejudice are less persuasive where, as here, the\n\nevidence is “‘amply sufficient to sustain each verdict,’” regardless of whether the\n\noffenses were tried together.

Sapp, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2004-Ohio-7008, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 73, quoting State v.

The testimony of the eyewitnesses to the shootings — Jackson, Dean, Osborn\n\fand Wylie — combined with Goodwin’s testimony and the other evidence offered by the\n\nstate provided strong evidence of Nitsche’s guilt on each of the offenses at issue. The\n\nstrength of the state’s evidence “‘establishes that the prosecution did not attempt to prove\n\none case simply by questionable evidence of other offenses.’” State v. McKnight, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2005-Ohio-6046, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶171-172, quoting State v.

Accordingly, Nitsche’s sixth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶100} As set forth above, we reverse the restitution order and remand this matter\n\nto the trial court for consideration of Nitsche’s present and future ability to pay the $2,880\n\nin restitution previously ordered.
