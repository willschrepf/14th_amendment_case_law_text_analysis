In this case, along with the companion case of United States v. City of Alexandria, 614 F.2d 1358 (5th Cir. 1980), we are faced with novel and difficult issues concerning consent decrees negotiated between the federal government and representatives of local governments settling suits alleging a \"pattern or practice\" of employment discrimination.  We hold here that the district court acted properly in approving the consent decree presented for his approval, because the consent decree is not unreasonable, unconstitutional, illegal, or against public policy.  In so holding, we necessarily reach the question of the status of affirmative action after the Supreme Court's decision in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978), and affirm the post-Bakke validity of race- and sex-conscious affirmative action plans in this circuit.  The two cases also require us to explore in some detail the roles and responsibilities of the parties to the lawsuit, the district judge, and the appellate court in this consent decree context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural history of this case involved a large amount of skirmishing over various issues.  The history which is germane to this appeal will be set out at some length, although very little of substance occurred.  On December 29, 1975, the Attorney General filed a Complaint against the City of Miami, various of its officials, and several organizations of police officers alleging that the defendants were engaged in policies and practices that discriminate against black, Spanish-surnamed, and female individuals with respect to employment opportunities and conditions of employment within the City of Miami, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983.  The Complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.  Jurisdiction was predicated on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3701 et seq., and the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 1242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 1975, Defendant City of Miami filed an answer denying the substantive charges of discrimination.  On January 28, 1976, Defendants Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and Miami Police Benevolent Association (PBA) filed an Answer denying the substantive allegations of the Complaint and raising thirteen affirmative defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On February 18, 1976, a consent decree, agreed to by the United States and the City of Miami, was approved by the court.  The decree states that it does not constitute an adjudication or an admission by any of the defendants of any violation of law, and provides for affirmative action in hiring and promotional procedures in favor of blacks, Spanish-surnamed individuals, and women.  On February 27, 1976, FOP and PBA filed a motion to vacate the consent decree, asserting several grounds for its invalidity.  On April 2, the court issued an order vacating the consent decree, finding that some of the activities ordered on the part of the City of Miami violated certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the City and FOP and PBA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1976, the United States and the City of Miami jointly moved for re-entry of the consent decree.  A similar motion was filed on November 17, 1976,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> accompanied by an affidavit attesting that the FOP and the City had been unable to negotiate their differences and by a statement of uncontested facts containing statistics concerning the composition of the labor force in the Miami area and of the workforce employed by the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing before the court on December 13, the United States and the City of Miami made several modifications in the proposed decree, responding to the court's concerns raised at the hearing.  After a further hearing on February 8, 1977, at which the court raised other concerns relating to the decree, the court finally re-entered the decree, as modified, on March 31, 1977.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It found that the decree did not violate the contractual relationship between the City and the FOP and PBA.  The FOP and PBA appealed the order re-entering the consent decree, and unsuccessfully sought to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, then, the relevant procedural history on this appeal is that a complaint was filed, defendants answered, and a consent decree was signed between the United States and the City of Miami over the objections of the unions which represent Miami Police Officers.  We must decide whether the court properly entered the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will first address two preliminary contentions of the FOP that the Attorney General lacked authority to institute this action, and that the court could not have approved the decree without the consent of the FOP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Authority of Attorney General</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOP argues that the Attorney General lacks authority to institute this action under the 1972 amendments to Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-6,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> which effected a transfer of authority concerning \"pattern or practice\" suits from the Attorney General to the EEOC.  The Attorney General argues that this transfer of authority only related to suits against private employers, and that the Attorney General retained authority to initiate pattern or practice suits against public employers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although for some time the ultimate resolution of this issue remained doubtful, see United States v. Board of Education of Garfield Heights, 581 F.2d 791 (6th Cir. 1978); United States v. South Carolina, 445 F.Supp. 1094, 1110-1111 (D.S.C.1977) (three-judge court), aff'd without opinion, 434 U.S. 1026, 98 S.Ct. 756, 54 L.Ed.2d 775 (1978), Congress has recently spoken plainly concerning its intent when the 1972 amendments were made.  Both the Senate and House Committee Reports to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> have clearly stated that the 1972 transfer of authority related only to suits against private employers, and that the Attorney General retained jurisdiction to initiate pattern or practice suits against state and local governments.  See S.Rep.No.750, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 4 (1978); H.R.Rep.No.1069, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> After these reports, there can be little doubt that the 1972 amendments did not deprive the Attorney General of authority to bring pattern or practice suits against public employers.  See United States v. Fresno Unified School District, 592 F.2d 1088 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 100 S.Ct. 62, 62 L.Ed.2d 41 (1979); United States v. North Carolina, 587 F.2d 625 (4th Cir. 1978); Garfield Heights, supra, 581 F.2d at 792 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the legislative history is not accepted as conclusive, we perceive no injustice in allowing the Attorney General to sue, and therefore apply the law in effect at present.  Our duty is to apply the law as it stands at the time we render our decision, unless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or legislative history to the contrary.  Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 2016, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974).  Accord Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 77, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Attorney General was amply authorized to institute suit by two independent statutory provisions, Section 122 of the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, P.L. 92-512, 86 Stat. 932 (Oct. 20, 1972)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> and Section 518 of the Crime Control Act of 1973, P.L. 93-83, 87 Stat. 214 (Aug. 6, 1973).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The relevant provisions of these Acts at the time suit was instituted were very similar.  Each act prohibited discrimination in all programs and activities which receive funds under it,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and each empowered the Attorney General, whenever he \"has reason to believe that a State government or unit of local government is engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section,\" to \"bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for such relief as may be appropriate, including injunctive relief.\"  State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, supra, &#167; 122(c); Crime Control Act of 1973, supra, &#167; 518(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the City has stipulated that it is a recipient of federal funds under each of these statutes, the authority of the Attorney General to bring suit under these statutes is unquestionable.  Moreover, the standards to be applied, at least in a suit in which the Attorney General's authority is based on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3766, are the same as those applied under Title VII.  See H.R.Rep.No.94-1723, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. at 32, reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at pp. 5374, 5418.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Necessity of FOP's Consent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP argues that the trial court should not have approved the consent decree without the approval of the FOP.  This argument involves two separate contentions.  First, the FOP asserts that it has been deprived of its \"day in Court\" by the waiver of findings of fact by the signatories to the consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Second, it argues that its exclusion from the consent decree violates Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of these arguments are meritless.  The FOP misses the crucial point here, to wit, that the consent decree orders no relief against the FOP.  Unless the FOP can demonstrate that it has been ordered to take some action by the decree, or ordered not to take some action,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> or that its rights or legitimate interests have otherwise been affected, it has no right to prevent the other parties and the Court from signing the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The FOP has made no such showing.  In fact, the district court specifically found that the consent decree does not violate the contractual relationship between the City and the FOP, and this finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP's Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 argument fails for the same essential reason: no rights of the FOP are affected by the decree.  Even if the FOP was at the outset a \"necessary\" party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> once it was determined that the consent decree would not affect the FOP's rights, it was not a \"necessary\" party to the judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 20 explicitly provides that \"(j)udgment may be given . . . against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities,\" making it clear that a judgment, consensual or otherwise, need not necessarily include all defendants in the lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must discuss the roles of the trial and appellate courts in approving consent decrees in suits brought by the Attorney General or the EEOC enforcing obligations under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Trial Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In what can be termed \"ordinary litigation,\" that is, lawsuits brought by one private party against another private party that will not affect the rights of any other persons, settlement of the dispute is solely in the hands of the parties.  If the parties can agree to terms, they are free to settle the litigation at any time, and the court need not and should not get involved.  As Judge Wyzanski has described this situation: \"the traditional view is that the judge merely resolves issues submitted to him by the parties . . . and stands indifferent when the parties, for whatever reason commends itself to them, choose to settle a litigation.\"  Heddendorf v. Goldfine, 167 F.Supp. 915, 926 (D.Mass.1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, procedurally it would seem to be impossible for the judge to become involved in overseeing a settlement, because the parties are free at any time to agree to a resolution of the dispute by private contractual agreement, and to dismiss the lawsuit by stipulation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> In this situation, then, the trial court plays no role in overseeing or approving any settlement proposals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, there are certain special situations in which the trial court is required by statute or rule to approve a settlement to which the parties to the litigation have agreed.  The three most prevalent examples of this are proposed class action settlements, proposed shareholder derivative suit settlements, and proposed compromises of claims in bankruptcy court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> See, e. g., Protective Committee v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 20 L.Ed.2d 1 (1968); McDonald v. Chicago Milwaukee Corp., 565 F.2d 416 (7th Cir. 1977); United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 517 F.2d 826 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1684, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976); Grunin v. International House of Pancakes, 513 F.2d 114 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 864, 96 S.Ct. 124, 46 L.Ed.2d 93 (1975); Young v. Katz, 447 F.2d 431 (5th Cir. 1971); Norman v. McKee, 431 F.2d 769 (9th Cir. 1970); Florida Trailer and Equipment Co. v. Deal, 284 F.2d 567 (5th Cir. 1960); Heddendorf v. Goldfine, 167 F.Supp. 915 (D.Mass.1958).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these three situations, the standard for approval has been stated both positively that the trial court must find that the settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable, see, e. g., Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1330 (5th Cir. 1977); West Virginia v. Chas.  Pfizer &amp; Co., 440 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 871, 92 S.Ct. 81, 30 L.Ed.2d 115 (1971) (quoting district court judge) and negatively that the trial court may only approve a settlement after determining that its terms are not unlawful, unreasonable, or inequitable, see, e. g., United States v. City of Jackson, 519 F.2d 1147, 1151 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have been unable to discern any difference in meaning between these variants on what we perceive to be essentially one standard; nor does the standard vary in application between the three different types of cases.  In each of the three situations bankruptcies, class actions, and shareholder derivative suits there are special considerations not present in ordinary litigation which make this standard appropriate.  In the bankruptcy situation, the \"fair and equitable\" standard was mandated by a statute, 11 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 574, 621(2) (West 1970) (repealed, P.L. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978)); see TMT Trailer Ferry v. Anderson, 390 U.S. 414, 424, 88 S.Ct. 1157, 1163, 20 L.Ed.2d 1 (1968).  In the class action and shareholder derivative suit contexts, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that the court approve the settlement before the action is dismissed or compromised, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) and 23.1, and careful scrutiny is necessary to guard against settlements that may benefit the class representatives or their attorneys at the expense of absent class members or shareholders.  The court's role as a fiduciary serving as guardian for the unrepresented class members has been held to stem directly from the language of the relevant rule.  See, e. g., Grunin, supra, 513 F.2d at 123; Heddendorf, supra, 167 F.Supp. at 925-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there have been few situations other than the three special situations in which trial courts have been asked to approve a settlement, and the language in some of the cases involving these special situations has been expressed without limiting its application to the type of lawsuit involved, there may have been reason to believe that whenever a trial court is asked to approve a settlement, he must determine that the settlement is abstractly \"adequate,\" and that his decision to this effect will be routinely approved by us on review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, however, an active role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement is the exceptional situation, not the general rule.  Even in the situations requiring court scrutiny, it has been said that, even after the court has inquired into the facts and law of the case, it need not reach any ultimate conclusions concerning how the case would be decided at trial, see Cotton, supra, 559 F.2d at 1330; indeed, trial judges have been told that absent fraud, collusion, or the like they should be hesitant to substitute their judgment for that of experienced counsel, even when those counsel represent private interests.  See id. at 1332 nn.2 &amp; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are faced with a situation somewhat different from that posed by ordinary litigation, for the interests of individuals and organizations other than those approving the settlement may be implicated.  The presence of these other interests prevents us, or the trial court, from taking a totally \"hands-off\" attitude toward the settlement reached.  In fact, if this were merely a suit between private parties in which interests of non-parties were implicated, we might be inclined to endorse a fairly active role for the trial court in determining the fairness of the settlement.  However, several factors convince us that the trial court properly took an intermediate stance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First is the extremely high premium put by Congress on voluntary settlement of Title VII suits.  There have been repeated asseverations of this principle.  In Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U.S. 36, 44, 94 S.Ct. 1011, 1017, 39 L.Ed.2d 147 (1974), the Supreme Court said: \"Cooperation and voluntary compliance were selected (by Congress) as the preferred means for achieving (the goal of elimination of unlawful employment discrimination).\"  This Court has wholeheartedly endorsed that conclusion.  See, e. g., Cotton v. Hinton, 559 F.2d 1326, 1331 (5th Cir. 1977); United States v. Allegheny-Ludlum Industries, Inc., 517 F.2d 826, 846 (5th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 944, 96 S.Ct. 1684, 48 L.Ed.2d 187 (1976) (\"it cannot be gain-said that conciliation and voluntary settlement are the preferred means for resolving employment discrimination disputes\") (Thornberry, J.); Hutchings v. United States Industries, Inc., 428 F.2d 303, 309 (5th Cir. 1970) (\"it is clear that Congress placed great emphasis upon private settlement and the elimination of unfair practices without litigation on the ground that voluntary compliance is preferable to court action\" (citation omitted) (Ainsworth, J.), Culpepper v. Reynolds Metals Co., 421 F.2d 888, 891 (5th Cir. 1970) (\"the central theme of Title VII is 'private settlement' as an effective end to employment discrimination\") (Tuttle, J.); Dent v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry. Co., 406 F.2d 399, 402 (5th Cir. 1969) (\"the basic philosophy of (Title VII) is that voluntary compliance is preferable to court action and that efforts should be made to resolve these employment rights by conciliation both before and after court action\") (Coleman, J.); Oatis v. Crown Zellerbach Corp, 398 F.2d 496, 498 (5th Cir. 1968) (\"it is thus clear that there is great emphasis in Title VII on private settlement and the elimination of unfair practices without litigation\") (Bell, J.).  To insist on a detailed inquiry by the trial court into every proposed settlement of a Title VII action would severely interfere with this policy by delaying approval of settlements and increasing their cost to litigants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second is the fact that the plaintiff here is a department of the United States government.  Unlike the situations in which we fear that a party may be attempting the profit at the expense of unrepresented individuals, e. g., class actions and shareholder derivative suits, we here have as plaintiff the government department charged with seeing that the laws are enforced.  We therefore need not fear that the pecuniary interests of the plaintiff and defendant will tempt them to agree to a settlement unfair to unrepresented persons,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> but can safely assume that the interests of all affected have been considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a careful calibration by the trial court to ensure that the relief granted goes exactly as far, but no further, than is required by the extent of the past illegal discrimination is impossible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Before trial, there is no way of knowing which particular practices of the defendants may have contributed to the gross statistical disparities presented in their workforces.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> However, there are parties present before the court who have spent long hours negotiating over the situation and who are intimately familiar with the practices of the defendants the defendants themselves and the Justice Department officials responsible for the lawsuit.  The Justice Department and the defendants are in an adversary posture.  The defendants do not want to give up more control over their personnel decisions than is absolutely necessary.  The Justice Department officials are charged with seeing that violations of our employment discrimination laws are remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other reasons for a deferential attitude towards agreements reached by consent in Title VII suits.  As this court has previously noted, when agreement is reached by consent voluntary compliance is rendered more likely, and the government may have expeditious access to the court for appropriate sanctions if compliance is not forthcoming.  See City of Jackson, supra, 519 F.2d at 1152 n.9.  Moreover, failure to enter the decree would result in the loss of \"the nation's investment in the resources consumed by the federal agencies in negotiating these decrees, as well as the chance justly to finalize a matter that otherwise would burden agencies and courts.\"  Allegheny-Ludlum, supra, 517 F.2d at 851.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that if the government agency negotiating with the defendants to remedy discrimination had been the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rather than the Department of Justice, and if a conciliation agreement with exactly the same terms as the proposed consent decree had been reached between the E.E.O.C. and the defendants, the district court's scrutiny of the terms of the agreement would be minimal.  In Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Contour Chair Lounge Co., 596 F.2d 809 (8th Cir. 1979), the Eighth Circuit upheld the district court's determination, 457 F.Supp. 393 (E.D.Mo.1978), that conciliation agreements between the E.E.O.C. and employers are specifically enforceable.  Neither the trial court nor the appellate court conducted a detailed inquiry into the reasonableness of the agreement; rather, each independently satisfied itself that the agreement contained no illegal terms, and specific performance was ordered without further inquiry.  We are unaware of any difference between the roles that the Department of Justice and the E.E.O.C. play in enforcing the antidiscrimination provisions of Title VII that requires courts to order specific performance of voluntary settlement agreements with the E.E.O.C. after a minimal inquiry into their legality, but enables a court to freely overrule agreements reached by the Department of Justice merely because the court would have reached a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that in this situation the trial court need only determine that the proposed settlement is not unconstitutional, unlawful, cf. Kelly v. Kosuga, 358 U.S. 516, 520, 79 S.Ct. 429, 431, 3 L.Ed.2d 475 (1959) (court will not enforce contract which violates the law), contrary to public policy, or unreasonable before approval is granted.  Moreover, for these same reasons, we believe that the decree proposed in these circumstances should be entitled to a presumption of validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This presumption of validity means that a district court judge must have a principled reason for refusing to sign a consent decree in this context.  A refusal to sign a consent decree based on generalized notions of unfairness is unacceptable.  Rather, the district court judge must state specific reasons why a proposed consent decree unduly burdens one class or another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge feels unable to make this determination without additional information, he may, in his discretion, hold whatever hearings he deems necessary to garner that information.  But, the judge must inform the parties who have proposed the decree of his precise concerns, and lend every possible assistance to reach a reasonable accommodation.  Only if it clearly appears that the proposed settlement cannot be modified to meet the standard set out above should he refuse to grant his approval, and then he must clearly articulate for our review his reasons for disapproval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the remedy that is jointly proposed by these parties is within reasonable bounds and is not illegal, unconstitutional, or against public policy, the courts should give it a chance to work.  The trial court retains the power to modify or vacate the decree if it later appears to have been unwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> At a later point, experience operating under the decree may prove that it did unjustly burden one group or another.  However, if the trial court can simply say that, without a full-blown trial of the facts, he cannot make a positive determination that the proposed decree is fair and equitable, and can therefore refuse to sign it, the goal of a society with equal opportunity for all will be needlessly delayed.  The expense to all sides of a full blown trial can be enormous.  If the resources of government agencies charged with enforcing anti-discrimination laws must be expended in the trial of complex factual issues in every case, the progress of remedying illegal discrimination is likely to slow to a snail's pace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> This result would be entirely contrary to the goals of Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court may only rely on whatever record he has before him when the settlement is proposed; if nothing appears to make him believe the settlement is unreasonable, illegal, unconstitutional, or against public policy, he should grant his approval.  If he cannot approve the settlement, he should explain his objections to the parties to give them a chance to meet them.  When objections to the settlement are presented, they should be carefully considered.  See E.E.O.C. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 556 F.2d 167, 178 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 915, 98 S.Ct. 3145, 57 L.Ed.2d 1161 (1978).  However, the burden must be on the objectant to convince the court to disapprove the proposed settlement, and the trial court's reasoned approval of the settlement will be entitled to much difference.  Otherwise, the policy of voluntary compliance with Title VII could be severely thwarted by the interposition of objections to the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Appellate Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has often been stated that the standard for appellate review of a trial court's approval of a proposed settlement is \"abuse of discretion.\"  Usually it is said that the settlement will be reversed on appeal only if it clearly appears that the trial court abused its discretion in approving the settlement.  See, e. g., Dawson v. Pastrick, 600 F.2d 70 (7th Cir. 1979); Cotton, supra; Allegheny-Ludlum, supra, 517 F.2d at 850; City of Detroit v. Grinnel Corp., 495 F.2d 448, 455 (2d Cir. 1974); Young v. Katz, 447 F.2d 431 (5th Cir. 1971).  These and similar cases contain no analysis of how the \"abuse of discretion\" standard on appeal relates to and interacts with the standard for approval at the trial level; rather, the abuse of discretion standard has allowed appellate courts to affirm the trial court's decision to approve a settlement without requiring the appellate court to undertake a detailed inquiry into the reasonableness of the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, this deference to a trial court's decision to approve a proposed settlement is appropriate.  Settlement of lawsuits by agreement has always been favored.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Trial courts generally have a greater familiarity with the factual issues and legal arguments in the lawsuit, and therefore can make an evaluation of the likely outcome were the lawsuit to be fully tried.  It is against this evaluation that a trial court can determine the reasonableness of a settlement.  Without this familiarity, the appellate court necessarily must defer to the trial court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the degree of deference should depend on the degree to which the reasons for deference apply.  In the instant case, the trial court was deeply involved in considering the merits of the arguments of both sides.  The trial court not only once vacated the decree upon the request of FOP, but also became involved in later modifications before the decree was re-entered.  Considerations such as the expertise and experience of counsel for the various parties and the reasonableness of their positions and arguments were undoubtedly present in the mind of the trial judge when he approved the settlement.  These factors weigh in our minds as we consider the settlement on review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the abuse of discretion standard cannot be used as a rubber stamp to approve all settlements, especially in cases involving the important issues here involved.  We must address the FOP's substantive challenge to the legality of the terms of the consent.  It is to this that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP's major challenge is that the decree impermissibly awards retroactive seniority to blacks, Latins, and women, in violation of &#167; 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h).  Additionally, it asserts that the use of percentage goals for hiring and promotion in the consent decree requires its reversal.  Because we feel that the latter issue is of paramount importance, we address it first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Goals and Targets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOP makes a broad attack on the use of hiring and promotional goals in the consent decree, relying on Title VII and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  The attack appears to be concentrated on the use of percentage goals or targets per se, although their appropriateness and reasonableness in this particular case are also questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Per Se Attack</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point in the history of the fight against discrimination, it cannot be seriously argued that there is any insurmountable barrier to the use of goals or quotas<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> to eradicate the effects of past discrimination.

Vogler, 407 F.2d 1047 (5th Cir. 1969).  To the contrary, affirmative relief is required to ensure that the effects of past discrimination are negated.  In Morrow, supra, this court held, en banc, that a decree which resulted in an increase in the number of black patrolmen on the Mississippi Highway Patrol from four to six was insufficient.  We insisted that the District Court fashion an appropriate decree which would have the certain result of increasing the number of blacks on the Highway Patrol.  We suggested to the District Court several of the various forms of affirmative relief which might be appropriate: hiring ratios, hiring pools, or a freeze on white hiring.  We recognized the need for the plaintiffs and defendants to fully cooperate with each other and with the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No decision of the Supreme Court has ever adopted the proposition that the Constitution must be color blind.  See Bakke, supra, 438 U.S. at 336, 98 S.Ct. at 2772 (opinion of Justice Brennan).  The Supreme Court has unanimously rejected a statute mandating color blindness on the ground that it would prevent District Courts from fashioning appropriate decrees.  See North Carolina Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 45, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 1285, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971).  \"Race must be considered,\" the Supreme Court said.  Id. at 46, 91 S.Ct. at 1286.  Race-conscious plans have also been approved by the Supreme Court in, for example, United Jewish Organizations v. Carey, 430 U.S. 144, 97 S.Ct. 996, 51 L.Ed.2d 229 (1977); McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39, 91 S.Ct. 1287, 28 L.Ed.2d 582 (1971); Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971); United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 395 U.S. 225, 89 S.Ct. 1670, 23 L.Ed.2d 263 (1971); and Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, unless the Supreme Court's decision in Bakke spells the doom of the use of racial and sexual goals by municipal employers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> prior precedent compels us to conclude that hiring and promotional goals are not per se unconstitutional, illegal, or against public policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frankly admit that we are not entirely sure what to make of the various Bakke opinions.  In over one hundred and fifty pages of United States Reports, the Justices have told us mainly that they have agreed to disagree.  In addition, we now know that Mr. Bakke must be admitted to the Medical School at the University of California at Davis, but that this does not mean that all affirmative action is doomed.  If we wished to delay voluntary efforts by municipal employers to achieve equality of employment opportunity for all persons regardless of race, national origin, or sex, we would have no trouble finding language in the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell supporting the position that, as a constitutional matter, race cannot be used as a factor in a selection process unless constitutional or statutory violations have been proved.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2755, 2757, 2758 (opinion of Justice Powell).  However, this was the view of Justice Powell alone; the four Justices who agreed with his result in the case found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue.  Moreover, we read his opinion to deny that specific findings of past illegal conduct are constitutionally required before a public employer can base decisions on race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Mr. Justice Powell states explicitly that the decision \"does not call into question congressionally authorized administrative actions, such as consent decrees under Title VII.\" 98 S.Ct. at 2755 n.41 (emphasis added).  Not only is the factual situation in employment discrimination cases materially different from that involved in Bakke, see id. at 2754, but also there has been detailed legislative consideration of the various indicia of previous constitutional or statutory violations, id. at 2755 n.41, particular administrative bodies have been charged with detecting violations and formulating remedies, id., and there is a legislative mandate to remove barriers to equality of employment opportunities.  Id. at 2758.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the opinion of Justice Powell suggests that the Congressional findings of discrimination in employment accompanying the passage of Title VII are sufficient to justify race-conscious remedies.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2758 n.44 (opinion of Justice Powell).  This conclusion is supported by Mr. Justice Powell's citation with approval of two cases involving affirmative action remedies imposed under Executive Order 11,246, 3 C.F.R. 339 (1964-1965 Compilation), reprinted following 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000e at 281 (West 1974), without detailed findings of past discrimination.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2754-55 (opinion of Justice Powell), citing Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L.Ed.2d 95 (1971); Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Altschuler, 490 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 957, 94 S.Ct. 1971, 40 L.Ed.2d 307 (1974).  In neither of these cases were detailed findings of past discrimination by the employer relied on to support the affirmative action plan; rather, the remedies were based on underutilization of minorities by labor organizations and the general findings supporting the Executive Order.  In neither case were there findings of specific instances of identified past discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Department of Justice made a determination, based on its investigation of the employment practices of the City of Miami, that there was a pattern and practice of discriminatory employment practices in the City of Miami.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> By signing the consent decree, the Department of Justice gave its administrative approval to the remedy chosen.  Nothing more is constitutionally required by the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell.  To conclude otherwise would require parties in agreement over a proposed remedial plan to put on a trial neither desires to convince a judge to approve their proposed plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that, under the views of the other four Justices<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> who reached the constitutional issue, the only possible obstacle to affirmative relief of the type here proposed would be a determination that the specific plan is unreasonable.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2792 (opinion of Justice Brennan).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> They correctly prognosticated the precise problem we face today:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>Indeed, the requirement of a judicial determination of a constitutional or statutory violation as a predicate for race-conscious remedial actions would be self-defeating.  Such a requirement would severely undermine efforts to achieve voluntary compliance with the requirements of law. And, our society and jurisprudence have always stressed the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the law. Judicial intervention is a last resort to achieve cessation of illegal conduct or the remedying of its effects rather than a prerequisite to action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2786 (opinion of Justice Brennan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Justice Brennan noted that \"the presence or absence of past discrimination is largely irrelevant to resolving respondent's constitutional claims,\" id. at 2787, because the whites and males affected by affirmative action are innocent of past discrimination.  Thus, while it may be fair to \"punish\" an employer or educational institution by interfering with its free selection processes only if it has been guilty of past discrimination, the wrongdoing of the institution is largely unrelated to the expectations of nonminority workers or applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus conclude that at least under the views of the five Justices who reached the constitutional issue in Bakke, the consent decree here is constitutional so long as the remedy was reasonable.  To that question we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Reasonableness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A stipulation was entered between the United States and the City of Miami concerning the statistical composition of the workforce of the City of Miami on September 2, 1976.  It was presented to the district court along with the joint motion of the City and the United States seeking re-entry of the consent decree.  The FOP has not challenged the stipulated statistics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statistics show that of the 911 black males employed by the City on September 2, 1976, 680 just less than 75%, were employed as maintenance workers.  For white males, the corresponding figure was 10%.  Conversely, the job categories official/administrative, professionals, technicians, and protective service collectively employed almost 79% of the white male city workers, but only about 15% of the black employees.  This disparity in job categories was directly reflected in a striking disparity in earnings between white and black males.  Approximately 53.4% of the white males employed by the City earned an annual salary in excess of $16,000, as compared to 6.8% of the black males.  Fully 64% of the black males earned less than $13,000 per year; only 17.2% of the white males earned salaries in this range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statistics speak just as plainly for female and Spanish-surnamed employees.  The labor force in Miami is 46.9% Spanish-surnamed, but this category makes up only about 11% of City employees.  For women, the corresponding figures are 44% and 16%.  Only 17.4% of Spanish-surnamed males employed by the City and only 7% of the females, earned more than $16,000 per year (compared to 53.4% of the white males).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statistics present an overwhelming prima facie case of discriminatory employment practices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> See, e. g., Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977); Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977); International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).  In Teamsters, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that statistics are competent in proving employment discrimination.  Id., 97 S.Ct. at 1856.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, statistics do not tell the whole story.  There may well be an explanation other than intentional racial or sexual discrimination for some or all of these statistical disparities.  But, as the Supreme Court has recently pointed out, statistics showing racial or ethnic imbalance are \"often a tell-tale sign of purposeful discrimination; absent explanation, it is ordinarily expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will in time result in a workforce more or less representative of the racial and ethnic composition of the population in the community from which employees are hired.\"  Teamsters, 97 S.Ct. at 1857 n.20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hiring and promotional goals established by the decree are substantially related to ending the long-standing pattern of discrimination evidenced by these statistics.  The ultimate goal is to obtain percentages of blacks, Spanish-surnamed individuals, and women generally consistent with their percentages in the community.  The interim entry level goals appear to be set below those levels,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> presumably reflecting the parties' belief that for the immediate future there may be an inadequate supply of qualified minority and female applicants.  Black, Latin, and female employees who were initially assigned to jobs traditionally assigned to members of those groups are given preference in filling vacancies in the City workforce, but these rights are limited so as not to unnecessarily trammel the opportunities of white male employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consent decree explicitly provides that \"(i)n no event shall the City be required to hire unnecessary personnel, to hire, transfer or promote a person who is not qualified, or to hire, transfer or promote a less qualified person, in preference to a better qualified person, consistent with the provisions of this decree.\"  The major exception to this provision is that members of the affected class who are the most senior applicants for vacant positions are given preference over persons not members of the affected class, unless the non-member \"has demonstrably superior qualifications.\"  These provisions appear to us to be entirely reasonable.  The members of the affected class (identified victims of discrimination, blacks and Latins who were initially assigned to traditionally black or Latin jobs, and women who were initially assigned to traditionally female jobs) are precisely those who were, or are members of the class most likely to have been, victims of discrimination.  The preference is limited to one successful promotion or transfer, a preference that might still leave some victims of discrimination behind their \"rightful places.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the affirmative relief is temporary.  The trial court retains jurisdiction to make other appropriate orders.  When the objectives of the decree have been met, it will be dissolved.  In the interim, if any provisions of the decree prove to be unduly burdensome to non-minority workers, the court can make whatever adjustments are necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, because we find the goals established to be substantially related to the legitimate goal of ending the long-standing pattern or practice of discrimination alleged by the United States, because the plan does not require the promotion of unqualified persons, because the plan does not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white male employees or act as an absolute bar to their advancement, and because it is temporary, we can easily find that it is a reasonable effort at a solution to a difficult problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Retroactive Seniority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOP also claims that the consent decree impermissibly awards retroactive seniority to blacks, Latins, and women.  This assertion widely misses the mark on two counts.  First, the consent decree does not award any retroactive seniority at all; it states merely that \"(t)he City shall compute the seniority of each member of the affected class based on the total seniority of that person with the City.\"  This approach to seniority has nothing fictional or retroactive about it, as each employee is given seniority credit for the time he was employed by the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, FOP's argument that retroactive seniority is impermissible is based on International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977), which is at most peripherally relevant to the fact situation here.  In Teamsters, the Court held that &#167; 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> immunizes from attack under Title VII otherwise bona fide seniority systems that afford no constructive seniority to victims discriminated against prior to the effective date of Title VII. 97 S.Ct. at 1861.  Here, the seniority system was not imposed by the court over the objection of the employer, but it was voluntarily agreed to by the employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> To say that a seniority system is immunized from attack means that the employer cannot be forced against its will to modify the system, not that the employer cannot agree to change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976), there can be no argument that the seniority system imposed by the decree in any way deprives other employees of indefeasibly vested rights conferred by the employment contract.  See Franks, 96 S.Ct. at 1271.  Just as a collective bargaining agreement may, for the purpose of furthering public policy interests beyond what is required by statute, enhance the seniority status of certain employees even though to some extent this will be detrimental to the expectations of other employees, Franks, supra,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> so may an employer voluntarily consent to changes in seniority provisions that do not abridge contractual, statutory, or constitutional rights of its employees or their bargaining agent to further important public policy interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> Indeed, at least one district court has gone further, and held that an affirmative action compliance agreement negotiated between a federal agency and an employer relieves the employer of its obligation under a collective bargaining agreement to arbitrate grievances concerning employee layoffs, when the procedure for choosing which employees to lay off was mandated by the compliance agreement.  See Savannah Printing Specialties &amp; Paper Products Local 604 v. Union Camp Corp., 350 F.Supp. 632 (S.D.Ga.1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although City of Miami employees may subjectively have expected the City to continue to use the criteria for promotion it had used prior to the consent decree, the FOP has been unable to articulate any doctrine which would demonstrate that this subjective expectation was protected by Florida law. It merely baldly concludes that \"the old promotional system gave employees a vested right to expect to be promoted if they qualified under its guidelines . . . .\" Reply Brief for Appellant FOP at 6. Given the complete absence of any support for this assertion, we doubt its validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we need not stop to conduct a detailed inquiry, since we do not believe analysis along this line would be helpful in determining whether the consent decree is legal under Title VII.  It is undoubtedly true that even expectancies characterized as \"vested rights\" under state law must fall before a court adjudication that Title VII mandates that the expectancies not be fulfilled.  See, Franks, supra, 96 S.Ct. at 1268-69; United States v. Hayes International Corp., 456 F.2d 112, 118 (5th Cir. 1972).  Thus, even if \"vested,\" the rights would not be absolute.  Because of Title VII's emphasis on voluntary compliance, see p. 1331, supra, we believe it equally true that such expectancies, even if \"vested\" for some purposes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> are not protected against voluntary affirmative action programs which are otherwise valid.  The primary focus must be on the reasonableness of the affirmative action plan in the particular circumstances of the employer, as discussed supra pp. 1338-1340, and we must not allow ourselves to be distracted by attempts to characterize it as an interference with vested rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conventional two-party lawsuit, one party wins and the other loses.  Although the resolution of the legal issues may be difficult and have consequences far beyond the parties, no one other than the parties is directly affected by the decree.  The situation here is entirely different.  Whatever the court does, or does not do, will affect all employees in the workforce of the City of Miami.  Some will be benefited; others, hurt.  Few would today disagree with the mandate of Congress that something must be done to ensure that discrimination does not prevent minorities and women from receiving their fair share of the economic opportunities available.  Reasonable persons, however, have disagreed and will disagree vehemently over how best to accomplish this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we see it, the best hope is provided by negotiation and compromise among all affected persons and parties.  Where minorities and women have been underrepresented in the past, non-minority males, even those innocent of any wrongdoing, must temporarily bear some of the burden.  Understandably, they will be unhappy with this necessity.  Conversely, minorities and women may feel that the opportunities foreclosed to them for years are not adequately made up by temporary limited preferences.  With these competing interests, the employer's interest in making its own employment decisions, government agencies' interests in eradicating discrimination in employment and the effects of past discrimination, and the predictions and predispositions of trial courts concerning these matters all weighed together, it is unlikely that all involved will be completely happy with any result.  But this is the nature of compromise.  The alternative is to insist that the parties put on a costly and lengthy trial, after which the district court still must face the troubling question of how much of a burden non-minority males must bear so that minorities and women can gain equality of opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the resolution of this balance, an agreement between the Justice Department and the concerned municipal governments must be given much weight, within a wide range of reasonableness.  Other interested parties, such as the FOP here, should be given every opportunity to demonstrate that the agreement unduly burdens the interests of white employees, and to propose alternatives which are less burdensome.  The district court gave the FOP every opportunity, and it was not convinced; we too have considered FOP's complaints, and neither are we convinced.  Therefore, the district court's approval of the consent decree is AFFIRMED, and the cause is REMANDED to the district court for his exercise of the retained supervisory jurisdiction over compliance with and possible modifications in the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff United States of America has filed its complaint in this action against the City of Miami alleging that the defendants are engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (Pub.

The recruitment program shall include maintaining contacts with area high schools, technical and vocational schools, colleges, and organizations which have traditionally expressed an interest in providing minority and female applicants or which indicate such interest in the future, and informing them of employment opportunities for City residents.  In addition, where appropriate, advertising of employment opportunities shall be placed in radio stations and other mass media primarily directed to black, Latin and female audiences for the purpose of emphasizing to minorities and women the availability of employment positions.

Now this is to be unlearned and we are told that this is not a matter of fundamental principle but only a matter of whose ox is gored.  Those for whom racial equality was demanded are to be more equal than others.  Having found support in the Constitution for equality, they now claim support for inequality under the same Constitution.  Yet a racial quota derogates the human dignity and individuality of all to whom it is applied; it is invidious in principle as well as in practice.  Moreover, it can as easily be turned against those it purports to help.  The history of the racial quota is a history of subjugation, not beneficence.  Its evil lies not in its name but in its effect; a quota is a divider of society, a creator of castes, and it is all the worse for its racial base, especially in a society desperately striving for an equality that will make race irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bickel, The Morality of Consent 133 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today we direct the approval of an agreement by the City of Miami to institute racial and sexual quotas in hiring and promoting its employees.  The agreement, like that recently upheld by the Supreme Court against Title VII attack in United Steelworkers and Kaiser Aluminum v. Weber,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> is \"voluntary\": here the employer was inspired to adopt \"voluntary\" quotas by the Department of Justice, there by the EEOC and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Here, as in Weber, there is neither admission to nor finding of the maintenance by the employer of discriminatory employment practices in the past, unless the majority's discussion of statistics at 614 F.2d p. 1338 is meant as such a finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> If it is, the majority has acted on incomplete data, data that ignore, among other things, age differentials among the ethnic groups of which we treat.  Country-wide, the median age of Jewish-Americans is 46 years; that of Anglo-Saxons, 34; of Blacks, 22; and of Hispanics, 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> On these figures alone, it would scarcely be surprising to discover in Miami or elsewhere that Blacks and Hispanics had not yet penetrated upper-level management in numbers proportionate to their strength in the general population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statistics being notoriously slippery tools for amateurs such as we, a word of caution from a professional on our subject may not be amiss:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A major nonmoral, nonsocietal variable that is routinely ignored is age.  As already noted, median age differences among American ethnic groups range up to decades.  The median age of American Indians is only one-half that of Polish-Americans (twenty versus forty); the median age of blacks is a little less than half that of Jews (twenty-two versus forty-six).  These differences affect everything from incomes and occupations to unemployment rates, fertility rates, crime rates, and death rates.  For example, Cuban-Americans average a higher income than Mexican-Americans, who are a decade younger, but in the same age brackets it is the Mexican-Americans who earn more.  Any attempt to explain gross income differences between these two groups in terms of either discrimination by \"society\" or by their respective \"ability\" runs into the hard fact that the gross difference is the opposite of the age-specific difference.  Similarly, blacks have lower death rates than whites, but this in no way indicates better living conditions or medical care for blacks, much less any ability of blacks to discriminate against whites in these respects.  Blacks are simply younger than whites, and younger people have lower death rates than older people; on an age-specific basis, whites have lower death rates than blacks.  Age differences also overshadow racial differences in unemployment rates: Blacks in the twenty-four to forty-four-year-old brackets have consistently had lower unemployment rates than whites under twenty every year for decades, even though whites as a group have lower unemployment rates than blacks as a group.  In short, the impact of age on statistical data is so great that to compare groups without taking age into account is like comparing apples and oranges.  Yet \"affirmative action\" comparisons of group \"representation\" almost invariably ignore age differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">T. Sowell, Knowledge &amp; Decisions 257 (1980) (footnotes omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p199\">\n      <span class=\"num\">199</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other neutral, statistical variables than age exist as well and are likewise ignored in our oversimplified comparisons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> But the addition of this factor alone, group age differentials, belies the conclusion of past race prejudice implied in the majority's confident assertions about \"striking disparity in earnings\" and statistics that speak \"just as plainly for female and Spanish-named employees\" as they do for blacks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> Partial statistics always speak plainly but rarely, if ever, accurately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p200\">\n      <span class=\"num\">200</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this feature of our decision is not especially remarkable, having as precedent not a few past efforts by us in the statistical line.  Nor is our conclusion that Title VII, despite its language,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> does not outlaw employment discrimination on grounds of race or sex.  We could scarcely conclude otherwise, given the Supreme Court's determination in Weber that the spirit of Title VII accords with racial discrimination against whites, so long as it is reasonable in degree.  Not these determinations, but another, afford today's opinion its landmark quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p201\">\n      <span class=\"num\">201</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For today's decision sustains preferential treatment of classes based on race and sex, in the form of hiring and promotion quotas, against constitutional attack on 14th amendment grounds.  As the opinion makes plain, the program of deliberate class preference that we here command is to be carried out, not in order to redress wrongs to particular individuals to accord any given person a rightful place of which he or she has been deprived or even to redress a discerned historic class discrimination by a particular employer, but to compensate for general societal discrimination in the past.  I can ascribe no other meaning to the approving quotation of a portion of Mr. Justice Brennan's minority opinion in Bakke at p. 1338, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p202\">\n      <span class=\"num\">202</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority cites a plethora of cases for the proposition that there is no \"insurmountable barrier to the use of goals or quotas to eradicate the effects of past discrimination.\"  See p. 1335 supra (footnote omitted and emphasis added).  In none of these cases, however, has any circuit court approved the imposition of racial quotas based on a statistical disparity alone, as the majority does here.  The majority correctly points out that this court, sitting en banc, approved racial quotas in Morrow v. Crisler, 491 F.2d 1053 (5th Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 895, 95 S.Ct. 173, 42 L.Ed.2d 139 (1974).  We did so, however, only upon the basis of a finding by the trial court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a> that the Mississippi Highway Patrol had \"historically engaged in unconstitutional discrimination in the employment of patrolmen,\" id. at 1055, and that the patrol's existing practices were discriminatory.  Id. In fact, we specifically characterized the relief ordered there as intended to \"offset the effects of past discrimination.\"  Id. at 1056.  Assuming that Morrow retains vitality after Bakke,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a> Morrow surely does not countenance the establishment of quotas on the mere basis of statistical disparities, without more; nor do either of the other cases from this circuit cited by the majority, see Franks v. Bowman Transportation Co., 495 F.2d 398 (5th Cir. 1974), modified, 424 U.S. 747, 96 S.Ct. 1251, 47 L.Ed.2d 444 (1976) (past racial discrimination had been demonstrated); Local 53 of the International Association of Heat &amp; Frost Insulators &amp; Asbestos Workers v. Vogler, 407 F.2d 1047 (5th Cir. 1969) (union admitted discrimination).  In fact, not one of the cases enumerated by the majority at pp. 1335-1336, supra, approves a quota in the clear absence of any findings of past employment discrimination.  I believe that the facts of Morrow represent the minimum threshold showing that must be made in order to support the imposition of racial quotas: namely, pervasive and established history of discriminatory employment practices by a specific employer against a particular class of individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its quantum constitutional leap, the majority interprets Mr. Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke \"to deny that specific findings of past illegal conduct are constitutionally required before a public employer can base decisions on race.\"  Maj. op., supra at p. 1337.  This is not so: Mr. Justice Powell's opinion makes clear beyond peradventure that the Supreme Court has \"never approved preferential classifications in the absence of prove(n) constitutional or statutory violations.\" 438 U.S. at 302, 98 S.Ct. at 2755 (footnote omitted and emphasis added).  The fact that Justice Powell couched his discussion \"in negative terms,\" maj. op., supra at p. 1337 n.28, cannot obscure the fact that the majority today charts a course that the Supreme Court has never sanctioned by approving a preferential classification in the absence of a proven constitutional or statutory violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p204\">\n      <span class=\"num\">204</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority also seeks support for its position in \"Mr. Justice Powell's citation with approval of two cases involving affirmative action remedies imposed under Executive Order 11,246, (citation omitted) without detailed findings of past discrimination.\"  Maj. op., supra, p. 1337.  See 438 U.S. at 301, 98 S.Ct. at 2754, citing Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania v. Secretary of Labor, 442 F.2d 159 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 854, 92 S.Ct. 98, 30 L.Ed.2d 95 (1971); Associated General Contractors of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Alshuler, 490 F.2d 9 (1st Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 957, 94 S.Ct. 1971, 40 L.Ed.2d 275 (1974).  In so doing, the majority ignores Mr. Justice Powell's crucial assertion that \"(e)very decision upholding the requirement of preferential hiring under the authority of Executive Order 11,246 has emphasized the existence of previous discrimination as a predicate for the imposition of a preferential remedy.\" 438 U.S. at 301 n.40, 98 S.Ct. at 301 n.40 (citation omitted and emphasis added).  Here we have no finding of the existence of previous discrimination as a basis for imposing such a remedy.  Mr. Justice Powell did say that \"(s)uch (racial) preferences also have been upheld where a legislative or administrative body charged with the responsibility made determinations of past discrimination by the industries affected, and fashioned remedies deemed appropriate to rectify the discrimination.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> 438 U.S. at 301, 98 S.Ct. at 2754 (emphasis added).  In the instant case we have been presented with no determination whatever by the Department of Justice that the City of Miami had a history of past discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a> We have before us merely the fact that the Department of Justice gave its administrative approval to a particular remedy by signing the consent decree.  I, for one, cannot equate the Department's signing a consent decree with its having made a determination that a particular employer has a history of past discrimination.  If the two acts were in some way equivalent, the employer by signing the consent decree would in a sense be admitting a past history of discrimination, despite the express provision in the consent decree that its entry \"shall not constitute an adjudication or an admission by any of the defendants of any violation of law.\" For the majority to conclude that \"(n)othing more is constitutionally required by the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell,\" maj. op., supra at p. 1338, than the Department of Justice's signature on the consent decree requires a tortured and, I fear, erroneous interpretation of Mr. Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke that I cannot endorse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps even more troubling to me is the majority's suggestion that a court can impose quotas to rectify the effects of societal discrimination.  Maj. op., supra at p. 1338. This is precisely the course Mr. Justice Marshall would have us follow, see Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 387, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 2798, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 et seq.  (Marshall, J., dissenting), and it is implicit in the language of Mr. Justice Brennan cited by the majority at p. 1338.  It is clear beyond peradventure, however, that the Supreme Court has not been willing to impose quotas to redress societal discrimination against a particular class.  If societal discrimination were the litmus for the application of quotas, racial quotas could be imposed upon virtually any employer and against his \"majority\" employees, since discrimination, sadly, has been pervasive in our society's past.  See 438 U.S. at 387, 98 S.Ct. 2798 et seq.  (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Even to hint that past discrimination by society in general affords federal courts a license to impose quotas against particular employers, as I believe the majority does, is an action that I cannot condone and that the Supreme Court refused to take in Bakke, thus provoking Mr. Justice Marshall's dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p206\">\n      <span class=\"num\">206</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With today's decision, the wheel appears to turn full circle to the one-discredited reasoning of Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed.2d 256 (1896).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a> Plessy found in the Constitution permission for deliberate legislative discrimination against blacks as a class; here we conclude that it permits planned and purposeful discrimination against whites and males because they are involuntary members of a class preferred unjustly in the past.  Thus, the momentum developed in abandoning one injustice carries us into still another, its opposite.  We lay it down that two constitutional wrongs do indeed make a right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p207\">\n      <span class=\"num\">207</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like my Brothers, I respectfully confess that I cannot discern the Court's precise position on this difficult subject from the opinions in University of California Regents v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 98 S.Ct. 2733, 57 L.Ed.2d 750 (1978).  I can, however, say with certainty that the Court was then by the margin of one vote unready to write into the Constitution again, as it once did in Plessy and as the majority does today, a license for governmentally engineered race discrimination when that seemed desirable as a matter of contemporary policy.  With the Chief Justice,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> I confess that such a policy of uplifting the downtrodden holds deep, short-run appeal for me.  If I were an elected official, holding a valid policy warrant, and if my views of the nature of the Constitution permitted me to do so, I might well endorse what we here do though with grave misgivings about the deliberate injustice occasioned to persons who did not choose to be born male or white.  I am not a legislator, however, and broad policy is therefore not my domain; my concern is the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those like myself, who have not felt the lash of race or sex prejudice, can never know how deeply it cuts, and I am very far from weighing such wrongs and indignities lightly.  But even bearing in mind the cynic's gibe at the majestic evenhandedness with which the law forbids both rich and poor to sleep under bridges, I still cannot bring myself to believe that in the long haul the interests of our people are well served by constitutional decisions that recoil from one class injustice to another.  I therefore would refuse, in this confused and confusing case, with the ink hardly dry on Bakke and Weber, to take such a constitutional giant step.  Henceforth, if I read the majority correctly, employers public and private become liable to governmental pressure, and their \"majority\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a> employees to government-induced race and sex discrimination, whenever a statistical \"imbalance\" is perceived, pressure unrestrained by any constitutional trammel except whatever a court may from time to time view as an unreasonable degree of racial or sexual discrimination.  And so, in our circuit, \"majority\" and \"minority\" are to become words of art cast free entirely from that numerical reference by which I had thought their use derived its main force and equity: a special concern for groups of citizens who are unfairly locked in disadvantaged positions by permanent and irrelevant common characteristics and who cannot, because of their numerical weakness, break out via the electoral process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I fully recognize that today's holding does not want for either reason or redeeming features.  As for reason, it well may be that when Title VII's prohibitions against race discrimination with their infinitely more explicit language and unambiguous history were overthrown in Weber, it was ordained that those of the fourteenth amendment could not long survive.  Nor is the majority rule freighted with such discredited trappings of racial prejudice or assumed class inferiority as informed the earlier \"wisdom\": far from it; all that the present constitutional ruling countenances is straight class discrimination, not class prejudice.  Finally, by the lights of our day, the purpose of the holding is at least as well intended as was Plessy, which bowed in its own day to what the Court doubtless viewed as current realities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p210\">\n      <span class=\"num\">210</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But I, for one, do not find those lights clear enough for such work as rechiselling a license for class discrimination in constitutional stone.

When the Justice Department advocates a settlement, we need not fear that its pecuniary interests will tempt it to agree to a settlement unfair to unrepresented persons.  To the extent that financial concerns enter the decision-making process at all deliberations at the Justice Department, it is likely to be in the form of resource limitations tempting the responsible officials to accept compromise settlements providing relief short of what might be obtained at trial, in order that litigation resources may be marshalled for use against more recalcitrant offenders.  See Zimmer and Sullivan, Consent Decree Settlements, 1976 Duke L.J. 163, 197 n.110 (1976).  Although this is of concern to members of classes discriminated against who seek additional relief, see City of Jackson, supra, this possibility clearly did not underlie the trial court's concerns about the proposed settlement.  We also note that the Justice Department must represent the interests of all citizens, white as well as black, males as well as female.

See generally International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977).  If the statute does not authorize relief for a certain type of proven discrimination, the trial court cannot order the defendant to provide it; if the statute does authorize relief, the trial court will ordinarily be given broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate \"make-whole\" remedy.  See, e. g., Morrow v. Crisler, 491 F.2d 1053 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 895, 95 S.Ct. 173, 42 L.Ed.2d 139 (1974).  This discretion is appropriate because the trial court will, after a trial of the disputed issues, be highly familiar with the extent of the violation; it is also necessary because the parties, left to their own devices, have failed to agree upon appropriate relief</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> See p. 1339, infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> See Alaniz v.

The first complaint alleging discrimination was filed in January, 1974.  After the Justice Department filed its own suit, and a class of non-black employees intervened, a trial was held.  In mid-1976, the district court issued an order mandating affirmative action.  An appeal was heard, Firefighters Institute, Etc. v.

Although that narrowly-drafted opinion is not directly relevant to the constitutional issue posed in the instant case because the defendant employers are municipalities, it does buttress our firm belief that affirmative action is consistent with the public policy of this country.  Weber does establish that &#167;&#167; 703(a) and (d) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a) and (d), do not bar the relief denied below.

The report's findings indicate that widespread discrimination against minorities exists in State and local government employment, and that the existence of this discrimination is perpetuated by the presence of both institutional and overt discriminatory practices.  The report cites widespread perpetuation of past discriminatory practices through de facto segregated job ladders, invalid selection techniques, and stereotyped misconceptions by supervisors regarding minority group capabilities.  The study also indicates that employment discrimination in State and local governments is more pervasive than in the private sector.  The report found that in six of the seven areas studied, Negroes constitute over 70 percent of the common laborers, but that most white-collar jobs were found to be largely inaccessible to minority persons.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Justices Brennan, Marshall, White and Blackmun</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> We note that Justice Brennan's opinion accords no deference to the lower courts' conclusion that the plan was unreasonable.

Overlooked by that argument, however, are the \"untold consequences\" of permitting the imposition of racial quotas without such a finding for the employer's \"majority\" employees, see n.14, infra, whose rights are bartered away by the employer in order to buy his private peace.  In a head-to-head tort or contract case the rights of third parties are not implicated; the parties may bargain away their own rights for whatever reasons they may choose.

Although findings of this ilk are at least one step removed from findings of past discriminatory conduct on the part of particular employers as in Morrow, there are nevertheless executive findings directly linking the hiring procedures of a group of employers to discriminatory union practices.  And while I might prefer more before approving a quota remedy, see, e. g., Morrow v. Crisler, supra, I cannot abide less.  Nor can Justice Powell, as I read his opinion in Bakke.  No even remotely comparable findings to those in Contractors Association of Eastern Pennsylvania were made in the instant case; here there have been no \"legislative or administrative . . . determinations of past discrimination . . . .\" 438 U.S. at 301, 98 S.Ct. at 2754.</p>\n        <p>In Associated General Contractors, supra, the district court used statistics of racial disparity \"as sufficient evidence to support an inference of racial discrimination.\" 361 F.Supp. 1293, 1299 (D.Mass.)

The court concluded that racial imbalance in the Boston construction trades was \"the result of past discriminatory practices on the part of many 'entities' in that industry.\" 490 F.2d at 18 n.15.  Thus, there was a trial-level, judicial determination of past discrimination predicated on an unrebutted inference.  In the instant case, to the contrary, we have no judicial determination; we have at best only an inference of discriminatory practices made by ourselves, on demonstrably insufficient data.  By signing a consent decree, the parties have chosen not to enter a forum in which the City of Miami could rebut that inference.  I do not see how that decision operates to transform an inference into a factual finding.  If a naked inference can give rise to the imposition of quotas, then Mr. Justice Powell's careful analysis is drained of its substance and rendered meaningless.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Such a unilateral determination by one party litigant would have an unsettling, boot-strap quality, even had one been made; and it may be doubted whether the Department, acting generally, constitutes such a \"legislative or administrative body charged with the responsibility\" of making determinations of discrimination in the employment context as Justice Powell had in mind in the passage quoted in text above.

The concepts of \"majority\" and \"minority\" necessarily reflect temporary arrangements and political judgments.  As observed above, the white \"majority\" itself is composed of various minority groups, most of which can lay claim to a history of prior discrimination at the hands of the state and private individuals.  Not all of these groups can receive preferential treatment and corresponding judicial tolerance of distinctions drawn in terms of race and nationality, for then the only \"majority\" left would be a new minority of white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.</p>\n        <p>438 U.S. at 295-96, 98 S.Ct. at 2751.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> But cf.

The calculus suggested is one infinitely complicated by the circumstance that, in our society, power and influence are exerted in myriad ways, many of great subtlety.  Such a case-by-case balancing of results, dependent upon ad hoc determinations of what groupings in our society command the most power from time to time, seems to me an exercise for which judges are ill fitted</p>\n        <p>And if any group, regardless of its numbers, can be a \"minority,\" competition for the favors attending that status seems well-nigh inevitable, with those who have officially received it fighting off aspirants to it and struggling to preserve their status as such.  Indeed, it appears to be in progress at the present time.  See Van Alstyne, op. cit. n.12, supra, at 805-807, quoting from The Washington Post of May 22, 1979:</p>\n        <p>A highly unusual and controversial proposal under consideration by a city agency would eliminate a large number of local ethnic groups from eligibility for lucrative minority contracts with the District of Columbia government.</p>\n        <p>The proposal, by the staff of the Minority Business Opportunity Commission, would eliminate from minority status all Hispanics born in Europe and South and Central America, leaving only those Hispanics born in Mexico or Puerto Rico eligible for the contracts.</p>\n        <p>The proposal also would eliminate from minority status persons born in Vietnam, India, China, Korea and Africa.</p>\n        <p>\"Oh, my God,\" one influential Hispanic leader with ties to the Barry administration said when informed of the staff proposal. \"If Marion agrees to do something like that, then it's really going to be a political war between Hispanics and blacks, and that would be terrible.\"</p>\n        <p>Carlos Rosario, acting director of the Office of Latino Affairs for the District, said he was not familiar with the proposal.  But, he said, \"I don't see why if they have Spanish heritage why they should lose their (eligibility for minority contracts).  If they are born minorities, they should have the same breaks as others.\"</p>\n        <p>See also The Wall Street Journal, March 21, 1980, at 16, col. 2:</p>\n        <p>In the department of racial and ethnic privileges, \"minority group\" members get special aid from the Small Business Administration.  The legislation was written to help blacks and Hispanics, and now also covers American Indians and \"Asian Pacific Americans.\"  We hear the Pakistani-Americans are about to have a go at it, but the program is in a tizzy because a group of Hasidic Jews has just petitioned the SBA to be counted as a minority.</p>\n        <p>While the Hasidim can point to all the usual kinds of disadvantages, their petition is opposed by the author of the legislation, Rep.

The history which is germane to this appeal will be set out at some length, although very little of substance occurred.  On December 29, 1975, the Attorney General filed a Complaint against the City of Miami, various of its officials, and several organizations of police officers alleging that the defendants were engaged in policies and practices that discriminate against black, Spanish-surnamed, and female individuals with respect to employment opportunities and conditions of employment within the City of Miami, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1981 and 1983.  The Complaint sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.  Jurisdiction was predicated on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as amended, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3701 et seq., and the State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, 31 U.S.C. &#167; 1242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 1975, Defendant City of Miami filed an answer denying the substantive charges of discrimination.  On January 28, 1976, Defendants Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and Miami Police Benevolent Association (PBA) filed an Answer denying the substantive allegations of the Complaint and raising thirteen affirmative defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On February 18, 1976, a consent decree, agreed to by the United States and the City of Miami, was approved by the court.  The decree states that it does not constitute an adjudication or an admission by any of the defendants of any violation of law, and provides for affirmative action in hiring and promotional procedures in favor of blacks, Spanish-surnamed individuals, and women.  On February 27, 1976, FOP and PBA filed a motion to vacate the consent decree, asserting several grounds for its invalidity.  On April 2, the court issued an order vacating the consent decree, finding that some of the activities ordered on the part of the City of Miami violated certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the City and FOP and PBA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 1976, the United States and the City of Miami jointly moved for re-entry of the consent decree.  A similar motion was filed on November 17, 1976,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> accompanied by an affidavit attesting that the FOP and the City had been unable to negotiate their differences and by a statement of uncontested facts containing statistics concerning the composition of the labor force in the Miami area and of the workforce employed by the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing before the court on December 13, the United States and the City of Miami made several modifications in the proposed decree, responding to the court's concerns raised at the hearing.  After a further hearing on February 8, 1977, at which the court raised other concerns relating to the decree, the court finally re-entered the decree, as modified, on March 31, 1977.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> It found that the decree did not violate the contractual relationship between the City and the FOP and PBA.  The FOP and PBA appealed the order re-entering the consent decree, and unsuccessfully sought to stay enforcement of the judgment pending appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, then, the relevant procedural history on this appeal is that a complaint was filed, defendants answered, and a consent decree was signed between the United States and the City of Miami over the objections of the unions which represent Miami Police Officers.

Each act prohibited discrimination in all programs and activities which receive funds under it,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and each empowered the Attorney General, whenever he \"has reason to believe that a State government or unit of local government is engaged in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section,\" to \"bring a civil action in any appropriate United States district court for such relief as may be appropriate, including injunctive relief.\"  State and Local Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, supra, &#167; 122(c); Crime Control Act of 1973, supra, &#167; 518(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the City has stipulated that it is a recipient of federal funds under each of these statutes, the authority of the Attorney General to bring suit under these statutes is unquestionable.  Moreover, the standards to be applied, at least in a suit in which the Attorney General's authority is based on 42 U.S.C. &#167; 3766, are the same as those applied under Title VII.  See H.R.Rep.No.94-1723, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. at 32, reprinted in (1976) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at pp. 5374, 5418.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Necessity of FOP's Consent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP argues that the trial court should not have approved the consent decree without the approval of the FOP.  This argument involves two separate contentions.  First, the FOP asserts that it has been deprived of its \"day in Court\" by the waiver of findings of fact by the signatories to the consent decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Second, it argues that its exclusion from the consent decree violates Fed.R.Civ.P. 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of these arguments are meritless.  The FOP misses the crucial point here, to wit, that the consent decree orders no relief against the FOP.  Unless the FOP can demonstrate that it has been ordered to take some action by the decree, or ordered not to take some action,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> or that its rights or legitimate interests have otherwise been affected, it has no right to prevent the other parties and the Court from signing the decree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> The FOP has made no such showing.  In fact, the district court specifically found that the consent decree does not violate the contractual relationship between the City and the FOP, and this finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP's Fed.R.Civ.P. 19 argument fails for the same essential reason: no rights of the FOP are affected by the decree.  Even if the FOP was at the outset a \"necessary\" party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> once it was determined that the consent decree would not affect the FOP's rights, it was not a \"necessary\" party to the judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 20 explicitly provides that \"(j)udgment may be given . . . against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities,\" making it clear that a judgment, consensual or otherwise, need not necessarily include all defendants in the lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we must discuss the roles of the trial and appellate courts in approving consent decrees in suits brought by the Attorney General or the EEOC enforcing obligations under Title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Trial Court</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In what can be termed \"ordinary litigation,\" that is, lawsuits brought by one private party against another private party that will not affect the rights of any other persons, settlement of the dispute is solely in the hands of the parties.  If the parties can agree to terms, they are free to settle the litigation at any time, and the court need not and should not get involved.  As Judge Wyzanski has described this situation: \"the traditional view is that the judge merely resolves issues submitted to him by the parties . . . and stands indifferent when the parties, for whatever reason commends itself to them, choose to settle a litigation.\"  Heddendorf v. Goldfine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1633098\"><a href=\"/opinion/1633098/heddendorf-v-goldfine/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The three most prevalent examples of this are proposed class action settlements, proposed shareholder derivative suit settlements, and proposed compromises of claims in bankruptcy court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> See, e. g., Protective Committee v.

City of Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328959\"><a href=\"/opinion/328959/13-fair-emplpraccas-1137-10-empl-prac-dec-p-10405/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1147</span></a></span>, 1151 (5th Cir. 1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have been unable to discern any difference in meaning between these variants on what we perceive to be essentially one standard; nor does the standard vary in application between the three different types of cases.  In each of the three situations bankruptcies, class actions, and shareholder derivative suits there are special considerations not present in ordinary litigation which make this standard appropriate.  In the bankruptcy situation, the \"fair and equitable\" standard was mandated by a statute, 11 U.S.C.A. &#167;&#167; 574, 621(2) (West 1970) (repealed, P.L. 95-598, 92 Stat. 2549 (1978)); see TMT Trailer Ferry v. Anderson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107642\"><a href=\"/opinion/107642/protective-committee-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107642\"><a href=\"/opinion/107642/protective-committee-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1968).  In the class action and shareholder derivative suit contexts, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that the court approve the settlement before the action is dismissed or compromised, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(e) and 23.1, and careful scrutiny is necessary to guard against settlements that may benefit the class representatives or their attorneys at the expense of absent class members or shareholders.  The court's role as a fiduciary serving as guardian for the unrepresented class members has been held to stem directly from the language of the relevant rule.  See, e. g., Grunin, supra, 513 F.2d at 123; Heddendorf, supra, 167 F.Supp. at 925-26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because there have been few situations other than the three special situations in which trial courts have been asked to approve a settlement, and the language in some of the cases involving these special situations has been expressed without limiting its application to the type of lawsuit involved, there may have been reason to believe that whenever a trial court is asked to approve a settlement, he must determine that the settlement is abstractly \"adequate,\" and that his decision to this effect will be routinely approved by us on review.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, however, an active role for the trial court in approving the adequacy of a settlement is the exceptional situation, not the general rule.  Even in the situations requiring court scrutiny, it has been said that, even after the court has inquired into the facts and law of the case, it need not reach any ultimate conclusions concerning how the case would be decided at trial, see Cotton, supra, 559 F.2d at 1330; indeed, trial judges have been told that absent fraud, collusion, or the like they should be hesitant to substitute their judgment for that of experienced counsel, even when those counsel represent private interests.  See id. at 1332 nn.2 &amp; 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we are faced with a situation somewhat different from that posed by ordinary litigation, for the interests of individuals and organizations other than those approving the settlement may be implicated.  The presence of these other interests prevents us, or the trial court, from taking a totally \"hands-off\" attitude toward the settlement reached.  In fact, if this were merely a suit between private parties in which interests of non-parties were implicated, we might be inclined to endorse a fairly active role for the trial court in determining the fairness of the settlement.  However, several factors convince us that the trial court properly took an intermediate stance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First is the extremely high premium put by Congress on voluntary settlement of Title VII suits.  There have been repeated asseverations of this principle.  In Alexander v.

See, e. g., Cotton v.

To insist on a detailed inquiry by the trial court into every proposed settlement of a Title VII action would severely interfere with this policy by delaying approval of settlements and increasing their cost to litigants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second is the fact that the plaintiff here is a department of the United States government.  Unlike the situations in which we fear that a party may be attempting the profit at the expense of unrepresented individuals, e. g., class actions and shareholder derivative suits, we here have as plaintiff the government department charged with seeing that the laws are enforced.  We therefore need not fear that the pecuniary interests of the plaintiff and defendant will tempt them to agree to a settlement unfair to unrepresented persons,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> but can safely assume that the interests of all affected have been considered.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, a careful calibration by the trial court to ensure that the relief granted goes exactly as far, but no further, than is required by the extent of the past illegal discrimination is impossible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> Before trial, there is no way of knowing which particular practices of the defendants may have contributed to the gross statistical disparities presented in their workforces.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> However, there are parties present before the court who have spent long hours negotiating over the situation and who are intimately familiar with the practices of the defendants the defendants themselves and the Justice Department officials responsible for the lawsuit.  The Justice Department and the defendants are in an adversary posture.  The defendants do not want to give up more control over their personnel decisions than is absolutely necessary.  The Justice Department officials are charged with seeing that violations of our employment discrimination laws are remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other reasons for a deferential attitude towards agreements reached by consent in Title VII suits.  As this court has previously noted, when agreement is reached by consent voluntary compliance is rendered more likely, and the government may have expeditious access to the court for appropriate sanctions if compliance is not forthcoming.  See City of Jackson, supra, 519 F.2d at 1152 n.9.  Moreover, failure to enter the decree would result in the loss of \"the nation's investment in the resources consumed by the federal agencies in negotiating these decrees, as well as the chance justly to finalize a matter that otherwise would burden agencies and courts.\"  Allegheny-Ludlum, supra, 517 F.2d at 851.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note that if the government agency negotiating with the defendants to remedy discrimination had been the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission rather than the Department of Justice, and if a conciliation agreement with exactly the same terms as the proposed consent decree had been reached between the E.E.O.C. and the defendants, the district court's scrutiny of the terms of the agreement would be minimal.  In Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Contour Chair Lounge Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"365586\"><a href=\"/opinion/365586/19-fair-emplpraccas-818-19-empl-prac-dec-p-9189-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span> (8th Cir. 1979), the Eighth Circuit upheld the district court's determination, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2347731\"><a href=\"/opinion/2347731/eeoc-v-contour-chair-lounge-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Neither the trial court nor the appellate court conducted a detailed inquiry into the reasonableness of the agreement; rather, each independently satisfied itself that the agreement contained no illegal terms, and specific performance was ordered without further inquiry.  We are unaware of any difference between the roles that the Department of Justice and the E.E.O.C. play in enforcing the antidiscrimination provisions of Title VII that requires courts to order specific performance of voluntary settlement agreements with the E.E.O.C. after a minimal inquiry into their legality, but enables a court to freely overrule agreements reached by the Department of Justice merely because the court would have reached a different result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that in this situation the trial court need only determine that the proposed settlement is not unconstitutional, unlawful, cf. Kelly v. Kosuga, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105831\"><a href=\"/opinion/105831/kelly-v-kosuga/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span>, 520, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105831\"><a href=\"/opinion/105831/kelly-v-kosuga/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, for these same reasons, we believe that the decree proposed in these circumstances should be entitled to a presumption of validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This presumption of validity means that a district court judge must have a principled reason for refusing to sign a consent decree in this context.  A refusal to sign a consent decree based on generalized notions of unfairness is unacceptable.  Rather, the district court judge must state specific reasons why a proposed consent decree unduly burdens one class or another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the judge feels unable to make this determination without additional information, he may, in his discretion, hold whatever hearings he deems necessary to garner that information.  But, the judge must inform the parties who have proposed the decree of his precise concerns, and lend every possible assistance to reach a reasonable accommodation.  Only if it clearly appears that the proposed settlement cannot be modified to meet the standard set out above should he refuse to grant his approval, and then he must clearly articulate for our review his reasons for disapproval.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the remedy that is jointly proposed by these parties is within reasonable bounds and is not illegal, unconstitutional, or against public policy, the courts should give it a chance to work.  The trial court retains the power to modify or vacate the decree if it later appears to have been unwise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> At a later point, experience operating under the decree may prove that it did unjustly burden one group or another.  However, if the trial court can simply say that, without a full-blown trial of the facts, he cannot make a positive determination that the proposed decree is fair and equitable, and can therefore refuse to sign it, the goal of a society with equal opportunity for all will be needlessly delayed.  The expense to all sides of a full blown trial can be enormous.  If the resources of government agencies charged with enforcing anti-discrimination laws must be expended in the trial of complex factual issues in every case, the progress of remedying illegal discrimination is likely to slow to a snail's pace.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> This result would be entirely contrary to the goals of Title VII.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court may only rely on whatever record he has before him when the settlement is proposed; if nothing appears to make him believe the settlement is unreasonable, illegal, unconstitutional, or against public policy, he should grant his approval.  If he cannot approve the settlement, he should explain his objections to the parties to give them a chance to meet them.  When objections to the settlement are presented, they should be carefully considered.  See E.E.O.C. v. American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"345722\"><a href=\"/opinion/345722/14-fair-emplpraccas-1210-14-empl-prac-dec-p-7506-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 178 (3d Cir. 1977), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

However, the burden must be on the objectant to convince the court to disapprove the proposed settlement, and the trial court's reasoned approval of the settlement will be entitled to much difference.  Otherwise, the policy of voluntary compliance with Title VII could be severely thwarted by the interposition of objections to the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Appellate Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has often been stated that the standard for appellate review of a trial court's approval of a proposed settlement is \"abuse of discretion.\"  Usually it is said that the settlement will be reversed on appeal only if it clearly appears that the trial court abused its discretion in approving the settlement.  See, e. g., Dawson v. Pastrick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"366974\"><a href=\"/opinion/366974/19-fair-emplpraccas-1540-19-empl-prac-dec-p-9270-james-dawson/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span> (7th Cir. 1979); Cotton, supra; Allegheny-Ludlum, supra, 517 F.2d at 850; City of Detroit v. Grinnel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"318518\"><a href=\"/opinion/318518/city-of-detroit-v-grinnell-corporation-manhattan-ward-incorporated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 455 (2d Cir. 1974); Young v. Katz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"298630\"><a href=\"/opinion/298630/fed-sec-l-rep-p-93062-c-robert-young-national-bankers-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span> (5th Cir. 1971).  These and similar cases contain no analysis of how the \"abuse of discretion\" standard on appeal relates to and interacts with the standard for approval at the trial level; rather, the abuse of discretion standard has allowed appellate courts to affirm the trial court's decision to approve a settlement without requiring the appellate court to undertake a detailed inquiry into the reasonableness of the settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, this deference to a trial court's decision to approve a proposed settlement is appropriate.  Settlement of lawsuits by agreement has always been favored.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Trial courts generally have a greater familiarity with the factual issues and legal arguments in the lawsuit, and therefore can make an evaluation of the likely outcome were the lawsuit to be fully tried.  It is against this evaluation that a trial court can determine the reasonableness of a settlement.  Without this familiarity, the appellate court necessarily must defer to the trial court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the degree of deference should depend on the degree to which the reasons for deference apply.  In the instant case, the trial court was deeply involved in considering the merits of the arguments of both sides.  The trial court not only once vacated the decree upon the request of FOP, but also became involved in later modifications before the decree was re-entered.  Considerations such as the expertise and experience of counsel for the various parties and the reasonableness of their positions and arguments were undoubtedly present in the mind of the trial judge when he approved the settlement.  These factors weigh in our minds as we consider the settlement on review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the abuse of discretion standard cannot be used as a rubber stamp to approve all settlements, especially in cases involving the important issues here involved.  We must address the FOP's substantive challenge to the legality of the terms of the consent.  It is to this that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FOP's major challenge is that the decree impermissibly awards retroactive seniority to blacks, Latins, and women, in violation of &#167; 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h).  Additionally, it asserts that the use of percentage goals for hiring and promotion in the consent decree requires its reversal.  Because we feel that the latter issue is of paramount importance, we address it first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Goals and Targets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOP makes a broad attack on the use of hiring and promotional goals in the consent decree, relying on Title VII and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  The attack appears to be concentrated on the use of percentage goals or targets per se, although their appropriateness and reasonableness in this particular case are also questioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Per Se Attack</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point in the history of the fight against discrimination, it cannot be seriously argued that there is any insurmountable barrier to the use of goals or quotas<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> to eradicate the effects of past discrimination.

To the contrary, affirmative relief is required to ensure that the effects of past discrimination are negated.  In Morrow, supra, this court held, en banc, that a decree which resulted in an increase in the number of black patrolmen on the Mississippi Highway Patrol from four to six was insufficient.  We insisted that the District Court fashion an appropriate decree which would have the certain result of increasing the number of blacks on the Highway Patrol.  We suggested to the District Court several of the various forms of affirmative relief which might be appropriate: hiring ratios, hiring pools, or a freeze on white hiring.  We recognized the need for the plaintiffs and defendants to fully cooperate with each other and with the District Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No decision of the Supreme Court has ever adopted the proposition that the Constitution must be color blind.

In over one hundred and fifty pages of United States Reports, the Justices have told us mainly that they have agreed to disagree.  In addition, we now know that Mr. Bakke must be admitted to the Medical School at the University of California at Davis, but that this does not mean that all affirmative action is doomed.  If we wished to delay voluntary efforts by municipal employers to achieve equality of employment opportunity for all persons regardless of race, national origin, or sex, we would have no trouble finding language in the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell supporting the position that, as a constitutional matter, race cannot be used as a factor in a selection process unless constitutional or statutory violations have been proved.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2755, 2757, 2758 (opinion of Justice Powell).  However, this was the view of Justice Powell alone; the four Justices who agreed with his result in the case found it unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue.  Moreover, we read his opinion to deny that specific findings of past illegal conduct are constitutionally required before a public employer can base decisions on race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Mr. Justice Powell states explicitly that the decision \"does not call into question congressionally authorized administrative actions, such as consent decrees under Title VII.\" 98 S.Ct. at 2755 n.41 (emphasis added).  Not only is the factual situation in employment discrimination cases materially different from that involved in Bakke, see id. at 2754, but also there has been detailed legislative consideration of the various indicia of previous constitutional or statutory violations, id. at 2755 n.41, particular administrative bodies have been charged with detecting violations and formulating remedies, id., and there is a legislative mandate to remove barriers to equality of employment opportunities.  Id. at 2758.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the opinion of Justice Powell suggests that the Congressional findings of discrimination in employment accompanying the passage of Title VII are sufficient to justify race-conscious remedies.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2758 n.44 (opinion of Justice Powell).  This conclusion is supported by Mr. Justice Powell's citation with approval of two cases involving affirmative action remedies imposed under Executive Order 11,246, 3 C.F.R. 339 (1964-1965 Compilation), reprinted following 42 U.S.C.A. &#167; 2000e at 281 (West 1974), without detailed findings of past discrimination.

In neither of these cases were detailed findings of past discrimination by the employer relied on to support the affirmative action plan; rather, the remedies were based on underutilization of minorities by labor organizations and the general findings supporting the Executive Order.  In neither case were there findings of specific instances of identified past discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the Department of Justice made a determination, based on its investigation of the employment practices of the City of Miami, that there was a pattern and practice of discriminatory employment practices in the City of Miami.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> By signing the consent decree, the Department of Justice gave its administrative approval to the remedy chosen.  Nothing more is constitutionally required by the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell.  To conclude otherwise would require parties in agreement over a proposed remedial plan to put on a trial neither desires to convince a judge to approve their proposed plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear that, under the views of the other four Justices<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> who reached the constitutional issue, the only possible obstacle to affirmative relief of the type here proposed would be a determination that the specific plan is unreasonable.  See Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2792 (opinion of Justice Brennan).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> They correctly prognosticated the precise problem we face today:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>Indeed, the requirement of a judicial determination of a constitutional or statutory violation as a predicate for race-conscious remedial actions would be self-defeating.  Such a requirement would severely undermine efforts to achieve voluntary compliance with the requirements of law. And, our society and jurisprudence have always stressed the value of voluntary efforts to further the objectives of the law. Judicial intervention is a last resort to achieve cessation of illegal conduct or the remedying of its effects rather than a prerequisite to action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bakke, supra, 98 S.Ct. at 2786 (opinion of Justice Brennan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Justice Brennan noted that \"the presence or absence of past discrimination is largely irrelevant to resolving respondent's constitutional claims,\" id. at 2787, because the whites and males affected by affirmative action are innocent of past discrimination.  Thus, while it may be fair to \"punish\" an employer or educational institution by interfering with its free selection processes only if it has been guilty of past discrimination, the wrongdoing of the institution is largely unrelated to the expectations of nonminority workers or applicants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus conclude that at least under the views of the five Justices who reached the constitutional issue in Bakke, the consent decree here is constitutional so long as the remedy was reasonable.  To that question we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Reasonableness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A stipulation was entered between the United States and the City of Miami concerning the statistical composition of the workforce of the City of Miami on September 2, 1976.  It was presented to the district court along with the joint motion of the City and the United States seeking re-entry of the consent decree.  The FOP has not challenged the stipulated statistics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statistics show that of the 911 black males employed by the City on September 2, 1976, 680 just less than 75%, were employed as maintenance workers.  For white males, the corresponding figure was 10%.  Conversely, the job categories official/administrative, professionals, technicians, and protective service collectively employed almost 79% of the white male city workers, but only about 15% of the black employees.  This disparity in job categories was directly reflected in a striking disparity in earnings between white and black males.  Approximately 53.4% of the white males employed by the City earned an annual salary in excess of $16,000, as compared to 6.8% of the black males.  Fully 64% of the black males earned less than $13,000 per year; only 17.2% of the white males earned salaries in this range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statistics speak just as plainly for female and Spanish-surnamed employees.  The labor force in Miami is 46.9% Spanish-surnamed, but this category makes up only about 11% of City employees.  For women, the corresponding figures are 44% and 16%.  Only 17.4% of Spanish-surnamed males employed by the City and only 7% of the females, earned more than $16,000 per year (compared to 53.4% of the white males).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These statistics present an overwhelming prima facie case of discriminatory employment practices.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> See, e. g., Hazelwood School District v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1977).  In Teamsters, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that statistics are competent in proving employment discrimination.  Id., 97 S.Ct. at 1856.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, statistics do not tell the whole story.  There may well be an explanation other than intentional racial or sexual discrimination for some or all of these statistical disparities.  But, as the Supreme Court has recently pointed out, statistics showing racial or ethnic imbalance are \"often a tell-tale sign of purposeful discrimination; absent explanation, it is ordinarily expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will in time result in a workforce more or less representative of the racial and ethnic composition of the population in the community from which employees are hired.\"  Teamsters, 97 S.Ct. at 1857 n.20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The hiring and promotional goals established by the decree are substantially related to ending the long-standing pattern of discrimination evidenced by these statistics.  The ultimate goal is to obtain percentages of blacks, Spanish-surnamed individuals, and women generally consistent with their percentages in the community.  The interim entry level goals appear to be set below those levels,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> presumably reflecting the parties' belief that for the immediate future there may be an inadequate supply of qualified minority and female applicants.  Black, Latin, and female employees who were initially assigned to jobs traditionally assigned to members of those groups are given preference in filling vacancies in the City workforce, but these rights are limited so as not to unnecessarily trammel the opportunities of white male employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The consent decree explicitly provides that \"(i)n no event shall the City be required to hire unnecessary personnel, to hire, transfer or promote a person who is not qualified, or to hire, transfer or promote a less qualified person, in preference to a better qualified person, consistent with the provisions of this decree.\"  The major exception to this provision is that members of the affected class who are the most senior applicants for vacant positions are given preference over persons not members of the affected class, unless the non-member \"has demonstrably superior qualifications.\"  These provisions appear to us to be entirely reasonable.  The members of the affected class (identified victims of discrimination, blacks and Latins who were initially assigned to traditionally black or Latin jobs, and women who were initially assigned to traditionally female jobs) are precisely those who were, or are members of the class most likely to have been, victims of discrimination.  The preference is limited to one successful promotion or transfer, a preference that might still leave some victims of discrimination behind their \"rightful places.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the affirmative relief is temporary.  The trial court retains jurisdiction to make other appropriate orders.  When the objectives of the decree have been met, it will be dissolved.  In the interim, if any provisions of the decree prove to be unduly burdensome to non-minority workers, the court can make whatever adjustments are necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, because we find the goals established to be substantially related to the legitimate goal of ending the long-standing pattern or practice of discrimination alleged by the United States, because the plan does not require the promotion of unqualified persons, because the plan does not unnecessarily trammel the interests of white male employees or act as an absolute bar to their advancement, and because it is temporary, we can easily find that it is a reasonable effort at a solution to a difficult problem.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Retroactive Seniority</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOP also claims that the consent decree impermissibly awards retroactive seniority to blacks, Latins, and women.  This assertion widely misses the mark on two counts.  First, the consent decree does not award any retroactive seniority at all; it states merely that \"(t)he City shall compute the seniority of each member of the affected class based on the total seniority of that person with the City.\"  This approach to seniority has nothing fictional or retroactive about it, as each employee is given seniority credit for the time he was employed by the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, FOP's argument that retroactive seniority is impermissible is based on International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Teamsters, the Court held that &#167; 703(h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> immunizes from attack under Title VII otherwise bona fide seniority systems that afford no constructive seniority to victims discriminated against prior to the effective date of Title VII. 97 S.Ct. at 1861.  Here, the seniority system was not imposed by the court over the objection of the employer, but it was voluntarily agreed to by the employer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> To say that a seniority system is immunized from attack means that the employer cannot be forced against its will to modify the system, not that the employer cannot agree to change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Franks v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span> (1976), there can be no argument that the seniority system imposed by the decree in any way deprives other employees of indefeasibly vested rights conferred by the employment contract.  See Franks, 96 S.Ct. at 1271.  Just as a collective bargaining agreement may, for the purpose of furthering public policy interests beyond what is required by statute, enhance the seniority status of certain employees even though to some extent this will be detrimental to the expectations of other employees, Franks, supra,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> so may an employer voluntarily consent to changes in seniority provisions that do not abridge contractual, statutory, or constitutional rights of its employees or their bargaining agent to further important public policy interests.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> Indeed, at least one district court has gone further, and held that an affirmative action compliance agreement negotiated between a federal agency and an employer relieves the employer of its obligation under a collective bargaining agreement to arbitrate grievances concerning employee layoffs, when the procedure for choosing which employees to lay off was mandated by the compliance agreement.  See Savannah Printing Specialties &amp; Paper Products Local 604 v. Union Camp Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2005456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2005456/savannah-print-spec-pp-loc-u-604-v-union-camp-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span> (S.D.Ga.1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although City of Miami employees may subjectively have expected the City to continue to use the criteria for promotion it had used prior to the consent decree, the FOP has been unable to articulate any doctrine which would demonstrate that this subjective expectation was protected by Florida law. It merely baldly concludes that \"the old promotional system gave employees a vested right to expect to be promoted if they qualified under its guidelines . . . .\" Reply Brief for Appellant FOP at 6. Given the complete absence of any support for this assertion, we doubt its validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, we need not stop to conduct a detailed inquiry, since we do not believe analysis along this line would be helpful in determining whether the consent decree is legal under Title VII.  It is undoubtedly true that even expectancies characterized as \"vested rights\" under state law must fall before a court adjudication that Title VII mandates that the expectancies not be fulfilled.  See, Franks, supra, 96 S.Ct. at 1268-69; United States v. Hayes International Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"301821\"><a href=\"/opinion/301821/4-fair-emplpraccas-411-4-empl-prac-dec-p-7690-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 118 (5th Cir. 1972).  Thus, even if \"vested,\" the rights would not be absolute.  Because of Title VII's emphasis on voluntary compliance, see p. 1331, supra, we believe it equally true that such expectancies, even if \"vested\" for some purposes,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> are not protected against voluntary affirmative action programs which are otherwise valid.  The primary focus must be on the reasonableness of the affirmative action plan in the particular circumstances of the employer, as discussed supra pp. 1338-1340, and we must not allow ourselves to be distracted by attempts to characterize it as an interference with vested rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a conventional two-party lawsuit, one party wins and the other loses.  Although the resolution of the legal issues may be difficult and have consequences far beyond the parties, no one other than the parties is directly affected by the decree.  The situation here is entirely different.  Whatever the court does, or does not do, will affect all employees in the workforce of the City of Miami.  Some will be benefited; others, hurt.  Few would today disagree with the mandate of Congress that something must be done to ensure that discrimination does not prevent minorities and women from receiving their fair share of the economic opportunities available.  Reasonable persons, however, have disagreed and will disagree vehemently over how best to accomplish this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we see it, the best hope is provided by negotiation and compromise among all affected persons and parties.  Where minorities and women have been underrepresented in the past, non-minority males, even those innocent of any wrongdoing, must temporarily bear some of the burden.  Understandably, they will be unhappy with this necessity.  Conversely, minorities and women may feel that the opportunities foreclosed to them for years are not adequately made up by temporary limited preferences.  With these competing interests, the employer's interest in making its own employment decisions, government agencies' interests in eradicating discrimination in employment and the effects of past discrimination, and the predictions and predispositions of trial courts concerning these matters all weighed together, it is unlikely that all involved will be completely happy with any result.  But this is the nature of compromise.  The alternative is to insist that the parties put on a costly and lengthy trial, after which the district court still must face the troubling question of how much of a burden non-minority males must bear so that minorities and women can gain equality of opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the resolution of this balance, an agreement between the Justice Department and the concerned municipal governments must be given much weight, within a wide range of reasonableness.  Other interested parties, such as the FOP here, should be given every opportunity to demonstrate that the agreement unduly burdens the interests of white employees, and to propose alternatives which are less burdensome.  The district court gave the FOP every opportunity, and it was not convinced; we too have considered FOP's complaints, and neither are we convinced.  Therefore, the district court's approval of the consent decree is AFFIRMED, and the cause is REMANDED to the district court for his exercise of the retained supervisory jurisdiction over compliance with and possible modifications in the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <p>CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff United States of America has filed its complaint in this action against the City of Miami alleging that the defendants are engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq., as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 (Pub.

Now this is to be unlearned and we are told that this is not a matter of fundamental principle but only a matter of whose ox is gored.  Those for whom racial equality was demanded are to be more equal than others.  Having found support in the Constitution for equality, they now claim support for inequality under the same Constitution.  Yet a racial quota derogates the human dignity and individuality of all to whom it is applied; it is invidious in principle as well as in practice.  Moreover, it can as easily be turned against those it purports to help.  The history of the racial quota is a history of subjugation, not beneficence.  Its evil lies not in its name but in its effect; a quota is a divider of society, a creator of castes, and it is all the worse for its racial base, especially in a society desperately striving for an equality that will make race irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p194\">\n      <span class=\"num\">194</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bickel, The Morality of Consent 133 (1975).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p195\">\n      <span class=\"num\">195</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today we direct the approval of an agreement by the City of Miami to institute racial and sexual quotas in hiring and promoting its employees.  The agreement, like that recently upheld by the Supreme Court against Title VII attack in United Steelworkers and Kaiser Aluminum v. Weber,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> is \"voluntary\": here the employer was inspired to adopt \"voluntary\" quotas by the Department of Justice, there by the EEOC and the Office of Federal Contract Compliance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> Here, as in Weber, there is neither admission to nor finding of the maintenance by the employer of discriminatory employment practices in the past, unless the majority's discussion of statistics at 614 F.2d p. 1338 is meant as such a finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a> If it is, the majority has acted on incomplete data, data that ignore, among other things, age differentials among the ethnic groups of which we treat.  Country-wide, the median age of Jewish-Americans is 46 years; that of Anglo-Saxons, 34; of Blacks, 22; and of Hispanics, 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> On these figures alone, it would scarcely be surprising to discover in Miami or elsewhere that Blacks and Hispanics had not yet penetrated upper-level management in numbers proportionate to their strength in the general population.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p196\">\n      <span class=\"num\">196</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statistics being notoriously slippery tools for amateurs such as we, a word of caution from a professional on our subject may not be amiss:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p197\">\n      <span class=\"num\">197</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A major nonmoral, nonsocietal variable that is routinely ignored is age.  As already noted, median age differences among American ethnic groups range up to decades.  The median age of American Indians is only one-half that of Polish-Americans (twenty versus forty); the median age of blacks is a little less than half that of Jews (twenty-two versus forty-six).  These differences affect everything from incomes and occupations to unemployment rates, fertility rates, crime rates, and death rates.  For example, Cuban-Americans average a higher income than Mexican-Americans, who are a decade younger, but in the same age brackets it is the Mexican-Americans who earn more.  Any attempt to explain gross income differences between these two groups in terms of either discrimination by \"society\" or by their respective \"ability\" runs into the hard fact that the gross difference is the opposite of the age-specific difference.  Similarly, blacks have lower death rates than whites, but this in no way indicates better living conditions or medical care for blacks, much less any ability of blacks to discriminate against whites in these respects.  Blacks are simply younger than whites, and younger people have lower death rates than older people; on an age-specific basis, whites have lower death rates than blacks.  Age differences also overshadow racial differences in unemployment rates: Blacks in the twenty-four to forty-four-year-old brackets have consistently had lower unemployment rates than whites under twenty every year for decades, even though whites as a group have lower unemployment rates than blacks as a group.  In short, the impact of age on statistical data is so great that to compare groups without taking age into account is like comparing apples and oranges.  Yet \"affirmative action\" comparisons of group \"representation\" almost invariably ignore age differences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p198\">\n      <span class=\"num\">198</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">T.

Nor is our conclusion that Title VII, despite its language,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> does not outlaw employment discrimination on grounds of race or sex.  We could scarcely conclude otherwise, given the Supreme Court's determination in Weber that the spirit of Title VII accords with racial discrimination against whites, so long as it is reasonable in degree.

As the opinion makes plain, the program of deliberate class preference that we here command is to be carried out, not in order to redress wrongs to particular individuals to accord any given person a rightful place of which he or she has been deprived or even to redress a discerned historic class discrimination by a particular employer, but to compensate for general societal discrimination in the past.

In fact, not one of the cases enumerated by the majority at pp. 1335-1336, supra, approves a quota in the clear absence of any findings of past employment discrimination.  I believe that the facts of Morrow represent the minimum threshold showing that must be made in order to support the imposition of racial quotas: namely, pervasive and established history of discriminatory employment practices by a specific employer against a particular class of individuals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p203\">\n      <span class=\"num\">203</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support its quantum constitutional leap, the majority interprets Mr. Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke \"to deny that specific findings of past illegal conduct are constitutionally required before a public employer can base decisions on race.\"  Maj. op., supra at p. 1337.

In so doing, the majority ignores Mr. Justice Powell's crucial assertion that \"(e)very decision upholding the requirement of preferential hiring under the authority of Executive Order 11,246 has emphasized the existence of previous discrimination as a predicate for the imposition of a preferential remedy.\" 438 U.S. at 301 n.40, 98 S.Ct. at 301 n.40 (citation omitted and emphasis added).  Here we have no finding of the existence of previous discrimination as a basis for imposing such a remedy.  Mr. Justice Powell did say that \"(s)uch (racial) preferences also have been upheld where a legislative or administrative body charged with the responsibility made determinations of past discrimination by the industries affected, and fashioned remedies deemed appropriate to rectify the discrimination.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> 438 U.S. at 301, 98 S.Ct. at 2754 (emphasis added).

I, for one, cannot equate the Department's signing a consent decree with its having made a determination that a particular employer has a history of past discrimination.  If the two acts were in some way equivalent, the employer by signing the consent decree would in a sense be admitting a past history of discrimination, despite the express provision in the consent decree that its entry \"shall not constitute an adjudication or an admission by any of the defendants of any violation of law.\" For the majority to conclude that \"(n)othing more is constitutionally required by the opinion of Mr. Justice Powell,\" maj. op., supra at p. 1338, than the Department of Justice's signature on the consent decree requires a tortured and, I fear, erroneous interpretation of Mr. Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke that I cannot endorse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p205\">\n      <span class=\"num\">205</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps even more troubling to me is the majority's suggestion that a court can impose quotas to rectify the effects of societal discrimination.

It is clear beyond peradventure, however, that the Supreme Court has not been willing to impose quotas to redress societal discrimination against a particular class.  If societal discrimination were the litmus for the application of quotas, racial quotas could be imposed upon virtually any employer and against his \"majority\" employees, since discrimination, sadly, has been pervasive in our society's past.

I can, however, say with certainty that the Court was then by the margin of one vote unready to write into the Constitution again, as it once did in Plessy and as the majority does today, a license for governmentally engineered race discrimination when that seemed desirable as a matter of contemporary policy.  With the Chief Justice,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a> I confess that such a policy of uplifting the downtrodden holds deep, short-run appeal for me.  If I were an elected official, holding a valid policy warrant, and if my views of the nature of the Constitution permitted me to do so, I might well endorse what we here do though with grave misgivings about the deliberate injustice occasioned to persons who did not choose to be born male or white.  I am not a legislator, however, and broad policy is therefore not my domain; my concern is the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p208\">\n      <span class=\"num\">208</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Those like myself, who have not felt the lash of race or sex prejudice, can never know how deeply it cuts, and I am very far from weighing such wrongs and indignities lightly.  But even bearing in mind the cynic's gibe at the majestic evenhandedness with which the law forbids both rich and poor to sleep under bridges, I still cannot bring myself to believe that in the long haul the interests of our people are well served by constitutional decisions that recoil from one class injustice to another.  I therefore would refuse, in this confused and confusing case, with the ink hardly dry on Bakke and Weber, to take such a constitutional giant step.  Henceforth, if I read the majority correctly, employers public and private become liable to governmental pressure, and their \"majority\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a> employees to government-induced race and sex discrimination, whenever a statistical \"imbalance\" is perceived, pressure unrestrained by any constitutional trammel except whatever a court may from time to time view as an unreasonable degree of racial or sexual discrimination.  And so, in our circuit, \"majority\" and \"minority\" are to become words of art cast free entirely from that numerical reference by which I had thought their use derived its main force and equity: a special concern for groups of citizens who are unfairly locked in disadvantaged positions by permanent and irrelevant common characteristics and who cannot, because of their numerical weakness, break out via the electoral process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p209\">\n      <span class=\"num\">209</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I fully recognize that today's holding does not want for either reason or redeeming features.  As for reason, it well may be that when Title VII's prohibitions against race discrimination with their infinitely more explicit language and unambiguous history were overthrown in Weber, it was ordained that those of the fourteenth amendment could not long survive.  Nor is the majority rule freighted with such discredited trappings of racial prejudice or assumed class inferiority as informed the earlier \"wisdom\": far from it; all that the present constitutional ruling countenances is straight class discrimination, not class prejudice.

When the Justice Department advocates a settlement, we need not fear that its pecuniary interests will tempt it to agree to a settlement unfair to unrepresented persons.  To the extent that financial concerns enter the decision-making process at all deliberations at the Justice Department, it is likely to be in the form of resource limitations tempting the responsible officials to accept compromise settlements providing relief short of what might be obtained at trial, in order that litigation resources may be marshalled for use against more recalcitrant offenders.  See Zimmer and Sullivan, Consent Decree Settlements, 1976 Duke L.J. 163, 197 n.110 (1976).  Although this is of concern to members of classes discriminated against who seek additional relief, see City of Jackson, supra, this possibility clearly did not underlie the trial court's concerns about the proposed settlement.  We also note that the Justice Department must represent the interests of all citizens, white as well as black, males as well as female.

See generally International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109665\"><a href=\"/opinion/109665/teamsters-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If the statute does not authorize relief for a certain type of proven discrimination, the trial court cannot order the defendant to provide it; if the statute does authorize relief, the trial court will ordinarily be given broad discretion in fashioning an appropriate \"make-whole\" remedy.  See, e. g., Morrow v.

Although that narrowly-drafted opinion is not directly relevant to the constitutional issue posed in the instant case because the defendant employers are municipalities, it does buttress our firm belief that affirmative action is consistent with the public policy of this country.  Weber does establish that &#167;&#167; 703(a) and (d) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a) and (d), do not bar the relief denied below.

In its report on the amendments, H.Rep.No.92-238, reprinted in (1972) U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 2137, 2152, the House of Representatives focused explicitly on discrimination by public sector employers:</p>\n        <p>In a report released in 1969, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights examined equal employment opportunity in public employment in seven urban areas located throughout the country North as well as South.  The report's findings indicate that widespread discrimination against minorities exists in State and local government employment, and that the existence of this discrimination is perpetuated by the presence of both institutional and overt discriminatory practices.  The report cites widespread perpetuation of past discriminatory practices through de facto segregated job ladders, invalid selection techniques, and stereotyped misconceptions by supervisors regarding minority group capabilities.  The study also indicates that employment discrimination in State and local governments is more pervasive than in the private sector.  The report found that in six of the seven areas studied, Negroes constitute over 70 percent of the common laborers, but that most white-collar jobs were found to be largely inaccessible to minority persons.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn30\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30_ref\">30</a>\n        <p> Justices Brennan, Marshall, White and Blackmun</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn31\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31_ref\">31</a>\n        <p> We note that Justice Brennan's opinion accords no deference to the lower courts' conclusion that the plan was unreasonable.

Thus, there was a trial-level, judicial determination of past discrimination predicated on an unrebutted inference.  In the instant case, to the contrary, we have no judicial determination; we have at best only an inference of discriminatory practices made by ourselves, on demonstrably insufficient data.  By signing a consent decree, the parties have chosen not to enter a forum in which the City of Miami could rebut that inference.

The calculus suggested is one infinitely complicated by the circumstance that, in our society, power and influence are exerted in myriad ways, many of great subtlety.  Such a case-by-case balancing of results, dependent upon ad hoc determinations of what groupings in our society command the most power from time to time, seems to me an exercise for which judges are ill fitted</p>\n        <p>And if any group, regardless of its numbers, can be a \"minority,\" competition for the favors attending that status seems well-nigh inevitable, with those who have officially received it fighting off aspirants to it and struggling to preserve their status as such.  Indeed, it appears to be in progress at the present time.  See Van Alstyne, op. cit. n.12, supra, at 805-807, quoting from The Washington Post of May 22, 1979:</p>\n        <p>A highly unusual and controversial proposal under consideration by a city agency would eliminate a large number of local ethnic groups from eligibility for lucrative minority contracts with the District of Columbia government.</p>\n        <p>The proposal, by the staff of the Minority Business Opportunity Commission, would eliminate from minority status all Hispanics born in Europe and South and Central America, leaving only those Hispanics born in Mexico or Puerto Rico eligible for the contracts.</p>\n        <p>The proposal also would eliminate from minority status persons born in Vietnam, India, China, Korea and Africa.</p>\n        <p>\"Oh, my God,\" one influential Hispanic leader with ties to the Barry administration said when informed of the staff proposal. \"If Marion agrees to do something like that, then it's really going to be a political war between Hispanics and blacks, and that would be terrible.\"</p>\n        <p>Carlos Rosario, acting director of the Office of Latino Affairs for the District, said he was not familiar with the proposal.  But, he said, \"I don't see why if they have Spanish heritage why they should lose their (eligibility for minority contracts).  If they are born minorities, they should have the same breaks as others.\"</p>\n        <p>See also The Wall Street Journal, March 21, 1980, at 16, col. 2:</p>\n        <p>In the department of racial and ethnic privileges, \"minority group\" members get special aid from the Small Business Administration.  The legislation was written to help blacks and Hispanics, and now also covers American Indians and \"Asian Pacific Americans.\"  We hear the Pakistani-Americans are about to have a go at it, but the program is in a tizzy because a group of Hasidic Jews has just petitioned the SBA to be counted as a minority.</p>\n        <p>While the Hasidim can point to all the usual kinds of disadvantages, their petition is opposed by the author of the legislation, Rep.
