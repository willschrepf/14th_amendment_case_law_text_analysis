FLORES ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–289.      Argued April 20, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009*\nA group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents\n   (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board\n   of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defen\n   dants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales\n   Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educa\n   tional Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to\n   take “appropriate action to overcome language barriers” in schools,\n   20 U. S. C. §1703(f). In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a\n   declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because\n   the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of\n   ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re\n   lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District\n   Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol\n   lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. The de\n   fendants did not appeal any of the District Court’s orders. In 2006,\n   the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, in\n   creased ELL incremental funding. The incremental funding increase\n   required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state\n   attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.\n   The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing\n   HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here. The\n   Speaker of the State House of Representatives and the President of\n   the State Senate (Legislators) intervened and, with the superinten\n   dent (collectively, petitioners), moved to purge the contempt order in\n——————\n   * Together with No. 08–294, Speaker of Arizona House of Representa\ntives et al. v. Flores et al., also on certiorari to the same court.\n\f2                          HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    light of HB 2064. In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). The District Court denied their mo\n    tion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule\n    60(b)(5) claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an\n    evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted\n    Rule 60(b)(5). On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5)\n    motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding\n    system. Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had\n    not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant re\n    lief.\nHeld:\n    1. The superintendent has standing. To establish Article III stand\n ing, a plaintiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized,\n and actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant’s chal\n lenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling. Lujan v. De\n fenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560–561. Here, the superintendent\n was a named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in viola\n tion of the EEOA, and the injunction runs against him. Because the\n superintendent has standing, the Court need not consider whether\n the Legislators also have standing. Pp. 8–10.\n    2. The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under\n Rule 60(b)(5). Pp. 10–34.\n       (a) Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a\n judgment or order if “a significant change either in factual conditions\n or in law” renders continued enforcement “detrimental to the public\n interest,” Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384,\n serves a particularly important function in “institutional reform liti\n gation,” id., at 380. Injunctions in institutional reform cases often\n remain in force for many years, during which time changed circum\n stances may warrant reexamination of the original judgment. In\n junctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns,\n which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree\n has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities. Finally, in\n stitutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their\n predecessors’ policy preferences and may thereby “improperly deprive\n future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.”\n Frew v. Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441. Because of these features of in\n stitutional reform litigation, federal courts must take a “flexible ap\n proach” to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this context, Rufo, supra,\n at 381, ensuring that “responsibility for discharging the State’s obli\n gations is returned promptly to the State and its officials” when cir\n cumstances warrant, Frew, supra, at 442. Courts must remain atten\n tive to the fact that “federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\n they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not violate [fed\n\f                   Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\neral law] or . . . flow from such a violation.” Milliken v. Bradley, 433\nU. S. 267, 282. Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nis whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been\nremedied. If it has, the order’s continued enforcement is unnecessary\nand improper. Pp. 10–14.\n     (b) The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5)\nanalysis just described. Pp. 14–23.\n        (i) Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict. The Court of Ap\npeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances war\nrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are “likely rare,” and that, to succeed, peti\ntioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to\n“sweep away” the District Court’s incremental funding determina\ntion. The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism\nconcerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the\nState Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.\nPp. 14–15.\n        (ii) The Court of Appeals’ inquiry was also too narrow, focusing\nalmost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding. It\nattributed undue significance to petitioners’ failure to appeal the Dis\ntrict Court’s 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexi\nble changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo. The Court of\nAppeals’ inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000\norder had been satisfied. But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is\nonly one of Rule 60(b)(5)’s enumerated bases for relief. Petitioners\ncould obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective en\nforcement of the order was “no longer equitable.” To determine the\nmerits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained\nwhether the 2000 order’s ongoing enforcement was supported by an\nongoing EEOA violation. Although the EEOA requires a State to\ntake “appropriate action,” it entrusts state and local authorities with\nchoosing how to meet this obligation. By focusing solely on ELL in\ncremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this man\ndate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate “appropriate ac\ntion” through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly\nsubstituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local\nofficials entrusted with the decisions. Pp. 15–18.\n     (c) The District Court’s opinion reveals similar errors. Rather\nthan determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief\nfrom the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied\nthat order through increased ELL incremental funding. Pp. 18–20.\n     (d) Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misper\nceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the\nRule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper ex\namination of at least four factual and legal changes that may war\n\f4                          HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    rant relief. Pp. 23–34.\n           (i) After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a “bi\n    lingual education” methodology of ELL instruction to “structured\n    English immersion” (SEI). Research on ELL instruction and findings\n    by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is\n    significantly more effective than bilingual education. A proper Rule\n    60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding\n    whether Nogales’ implementation of SEI is a “changed circumstance”\n    warranting relief. Pp. 23–25.\n           (ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n    (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant “changed\n    circumstance.” Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\n    constitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to\n    petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted\n    the State to make significant structural and programming changes in\n    its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for\n    education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided\n    evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales’ ELL students\n    through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a\n    shift in federal education policy. Pp. 25–29.\n           (iii) Nogales’ superintendent instituted significant structural\n    and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class\n    sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of\n    teachers. Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the\n    lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought\n    Nogales’ ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even\n    without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.\n    This was error. Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educa\n    tional programming and services to students, not the amount of\n    money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners\n    from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL pro\n    gramming in ways other than through increased incremental fund\n    ing. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should\n    ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements,\n    Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL\n    students. Pp. 29–32.\n           (iv) There was an overall increase in education funding avail\n    able in Nogales. The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that\n    petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to\n    support EEOA-compliant ELL programming. This was clear legal\n    error. The EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement does not neces\n    sarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that\n    funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come\n    from a particular source. Thus, the District Court should evaluate\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                      5\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n  whether the State’s general education funding budget, in addition to\n  local revenues, currently supports EEOA-compliant ELL program\n  ming in Nogales. Pp. 32–34.\n    3. On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction\n  as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider\n  whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief. The re\n  cord contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district\n  other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities\n  to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA\n  can justify a statewide injunction here. The state attorney general’s\n  concern that a “Nogales only” remedy would run afoul of the Arizona\n  Constitution’s equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid ba\n  sis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question\n  to be determined by state authorities. Unless the District Court con\n  cludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate\n  the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.

S. C. §1703(f), which requires a State “to take\nappropriate action to overcome language barriers that\nimpede equal participation by its students in its instruc\ntional programs.” In 2000, the District Court entered a\ndeclaratory judgment with respect to Nogales, and in\n2001, the court extended the order to apply to the entire\nState. Over the next eight years, petitioners repeatedly\nsought relief from the District Court’s orders, but to no\n\f2                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\navail. We granted certiorari after the Court of Appeals for\nthe Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners’ mo\ntion for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n60(b)(5), and we now reverse the judgment of the Court of\nAppeals and remand for further proceedings.\n   As we explain, the District Court and the Court of Ap\npeals misunderstood both the obligation that the EEOA\nimposes on States and the nature of the inquiry that is\nrequired when parties such as petitioners seek relief\nunder Rule 60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a\njudgment is “no longer equitable.” Both of the lower\ncourts focused excessively on the narrow question of the\nadequacy of the State’s incremental funding for ELL\ninstruction instead of fairly considering the broader ques\ntion whether, as a result of important changes during the\nintervening years, the State was fulfilling its obligation\nunder the EEOA by other means. The question at issue in\nthese cases is not whether Arizona must take “appropriate\naction” to overcome the language barriers that impede\nELL students. Of course it must. But petitioners argue\nthat Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by\nnew means that reflect new policy insights and other\nchanged circumstances. Rule 60(b)(5) provides the vehicle\nfor petitioners to bring such an argument.\n                               I\n\n                              A\n\n  In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL pro\ngram in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in\nthe District Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of\n“all minority ‘at risk’ and limited English proficient chil\ndren . . . now or hereafter, enrolled in the Nogales Unified\nSchool District . . . as well as their parents and guardi\nans.” 172 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (2000). The plaintiffs\nsought a declaratory judgment holding that the State of\nArizona, its Board of Education, and its Superintendent of\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                    3\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nPublic Instruction (defendants) were violating the EEOA\nby providing inadequate ELL instruction in Nogales.1\n  The relevant portion of the EEOA states:\n     “No State shall deny equal educational opportunity to\n     an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex,\n     or national origin, by—\n          .           .         .          .            .\n     “(f) the failure by an educational agency to take ap\n     propriate action to overcome language barriers that\n     impede equal participation by its students in its in\n     structional programs.” 20 U. S. C. §1703 (emphasis\n     added).\nBy simply requiring a State “to take appropriate action to\novercome language barriers” without specifying particular\nactions that a State must take, “Congress intended to\nleave state and local educational authorities a substantial\namount of latitude in choosing the programs and tech\nniques they would use to meet their obligations under the\nEEOA.” Castaneda v. Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989, 1009 (CA5\n1981).\n  In August 1999, after seven years of pretrial proceed\nings and after settling various claims regarding the struc\n——————\n  1 We have previously held that Congress may validly abrogate the\n\nStates’ sovereign immunity only by doing so (1) unequivocally and (2)\npursuant to certain valid grants of constitutional authority. See, e.g.,\nKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000). With respect\nto the second requirement, we have held that statutes enacted pursu\nant to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment must provide a remedy that is\n“congruent and proportional” to the injury that Congress intended to\naddress. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997). Prior\nto City of Boerne, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that\nthe EEOA, which was enacted pursuant to §5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, see 20 U. S. C. §§1702(a)(1), (b), validly abrogates the\nStates’ sovereign immunity. See Los Angeles Branch NAACP v. Los\nAngeles Unified School Dist., 714 F. 2d 946, 950–951 (1983); see also\nFlores v. Arizona, 516 F. 3d, 1140, 1146, n. 2 (CA9 2008) (relying on Los\nAngeles NAACP). That issue is not before us in these cases.\n\f4                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nture of Nogales’ ELL curriculum, the evaluation and moni\ntoring of Nogales’ students, and the provision of tutoring\nand other compensatory instruction, the parties proceeded\nto trial. In January 2000, the District Court concluded\nthat defendants were violating the EEOA because the\namount of funding the State allocated for the special needs\nof ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary\nand not related to the actual funding needed to cover the\ncosts of ELL instruction in Nogales. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1239. Defendants did not appeal the District Court’s\norder.\n                             B\n   In the years following, the District Court entered a\nseries of additional orders and injunctions. In October\n2000, the court ordered the State to “prepare a cost study\nto establish the proper appropriation to effectively imple\nment” ELL programs. 160 F. Supp. 2d 1043, 1047. In\nJune 2001, the court applied the declaratory judgment\norder statewide and granted injunctive relief accordingly.\nNo. CIV. 92–596TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369, *2 (June\n25, 2001). The court took this step even though the certi\nfied class included only Nogales students and parents and\neven though the court did not find that any districts other\nthan Nogales were in violation of the EEOA. The court set\na deadline of January 31, 2002, for the State to provide\nfunding that “bear[s] a rational relationship to the actual\nfunding needed.” Ibid.\n   In January 2005, the court gave the State 90 days to\n“appropriately and constitutionally fun[d] the state’s ELL\nprograms taking into account the [Rule’s] previous or\nders.” No. CIV. 92–596–TUC–ACM, p. 5, App. 393. The\nState failed to meet this deadline, and in December 2005,\nthe court held the State in contempt. Although the legis\nlature was not then a party to the suit, the court ordered\nthat “the legislature has 15 calendar days after the begin\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The schedule of fines that the court im\nposed escalated from $500,000 to $2 million per day. Id.,\nat 1120–1121.\n                             C\n   The defendants did not appeal any of the District\nCourt’s orders, and the record suggests that some state\nofficials supported their continued enforcement. In June\n2001, the state attorney general acquiesced in the state\nwide extension of the declaratory judgment order, a step\nthat the State has explained by reference to the Arizona\nconstitutional requirement of uniform statewide school\nfunding. See Brief for Appellee State of Arizona et al. in\nNo. 07–15603 etc. (CA9), p. 60 (citing Ariz. Const., Art. 11,\n§1(A)). At a hearing in February 2006, a new attorney\ngeneral opposed the superintendent’s request for a stay of\nthe December 2005 order imposing sanctions and fines,\nand filed a proposed distribution of the accrued fines.\n   In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines,\nthe state legislature passed HB 2064, which was designed\nto implement a permanent funding solution to the prob\nlems identified by the District Court in 2000. Among\nother things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding\n(with a 2-year per-student limit on such funding) and\ncreated two new funds—a structured English immersion\nfund and a compensatory instruction fund—to cover addi\ntional costs of ELL programming. Moneys in both newly\ncreated funds were to be offset by available federal mon\neys. HB 2064 also instituted several programming and\nstructural changes.\n   The Governor did not approve of HB 2064’s funding\nprovisions, but she allowed the bill to become law without\n\f6                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nher signature. Because HB 2064’s incremental ELL fund\ning increase required court approval to become effective,\nthe Governor requested the attorney general to move for\naccelerated consideration by the District Court. In doing\nso, she explained that “ ‘[a]fter nine months of meetings\nand three vetoes, it is time to take this matter to a federal\njudge. I am convinced that getting this bill into court now\nis the most expeditious way ultimately to bring the state\ninto compliance with federal law.’ ” Flores v. Arizona, 516\nF. 3d 1140, 1153, n. 16 (CA9 2008). The State Board of\nEducation joined the Governor in opposing HB 2064.\nTogether, the State Board of Education, the State of Ari\nzona, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.\n   With the principal defendants in the action siding with\nthe plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Represen\ntatives and the President of the State Senate (Legislators)\nfiled a motion to intervene as representatives of their\nrespective legislative bodies. App. 55. In support of their\nmotion, they stated that although the attorney general\nhad a “legal duty” to defend HB 2064, the attorney general\nhad shown “little enthusiasm” for advancing the legisla\nture’s interests. Id., at 57. Among other things, the Legis\nlators noted that the attorney general “failed to take an\nappeal of the judgment entered in this case in 2000 and\nhas failed to appeal any of the injunctions and other or\nders issued in aid of the judgment.” Id., at 60. The Dis\ntrict Court granted the Legislators’ motion for permissive\nintervention, and the Legislators and superintendent\n(together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District\nCourt’s contempt order in light of HB 2064. Alternatively,\nthey moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.\n   In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners’\nmotion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in\nthree respects. First, while HB 2064 increased ELL in\ncremental funding by approximately $80 per student, the\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            7\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ncourt held that this increase was not rationally related to\neffective ELL programming. Second, the court concluded\nthat imposing a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL\nstudent was irrational. Third, according to the court, HB\n2064 violated federal law by using federal funds to “sup\nplant” rather than “supplement” state funds. No. CV–92–\n596–TUC–RCC, pp. 4–8 (Apr. 25, 2006), App. to Pet. for\nCert. in No. 08–294, pp. 176a, 181a–182a. The court did\nnot address petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) claim that changed\ncircumstances rendered continued enforcement of the\noriginal declaratory judgment order inequitable. Petition\ners appealed.\n   In an unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit vacated the District Court’s April 2006\norder, the sanctions, and the imposition of fines, and\nremanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine\nwhether Rule 60(b)(5) relief was warranted. 204 Fed.\nAppx. 580 (2006).\n   On remand, the District Court denied petitioners’ Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. 480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1167 (Ariz. 2007).\nHolding that HB 2064 did not establish “a funding system\nthat rationally relates funding available to the actual costs\nof all elements of ELL instruction,” id., at 1165, the court\ngave the State until the end of the legislative session to\ncomply with its orders. The State failed to do so, and the\nDistrict Court again held the State in contempt. No. CV\n92–596 TUC–RCC (Oct. 10, 2007), App. 86. Petitioners\nappealed.\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed. 516 F. 3d 1140. It\nacknowledged that Nogales had “made significant strides\nsince 2000,” id., at 1156, but concluded that the progress\ndid not warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief. Emphasizing that\nRule 60(b)(5) is not a substitute for a timely appeal, and\ncharacterizing the original declaratory judgment order as\ncentering on the adequacy of ELL incremental funding,\nthe Court of Appeals explained that relief would be appro\n\f8                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\npriate only if petitioners had shown “either that there are\nno longer incremental costs associated with ELL programs\nin Arizona” or that Arizona had altered its funding model.\nId., at 1169. The Court of Appeals concluded that peti\ntioners had made neither showing, and it rejected peti\ntioners’ other arguments, including the claim that Con\ngress’ enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n(NCLB), 115 Stat. 1702, as added, 20 U. S. C. §6842 et\nseq., constituted a changed legal circumstance that war\nranted Rule 60(b)(5) relief.\n   We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), and now\nreverse.\n                                II\n   Before addressing the merits of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion, we consider the threshold issue of standing—“an\nessential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy\nrequirement of Article III.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,\n504 U. S. 555, 560 (1992). To establish standing, a plain\ntiff must present an injury that is concrete, particularized,\nand actual or imminent; fairly traceable to the defendant’s\nchallenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.\nId., at 560–561. Here, as in all standing inquiries, the\ncritical question is whether at least one petitioner has\n“alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the con\ntroversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court\njurisdiction.” Summers v. Earth Island Institute, 555 U. S.\n___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422\nU. S. 490, 498 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n   We agree with the Court of Appeals that the superin\ntendent has standing because he “is a named defendant in\nthe case[,] the Declaratory Judgment held him to be in\nviolation of the EEOA, and the current injunction runs\nagainst him.” 516 F. 3d, at 1164 (citation omitted). For\nthese reasons alone, he has alleged a sufficiently “ ‘per\nsonal stake in the outcome of the controversy’ ” to support\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U.

Warth, supra, at 498; see also United States v.\nSweeney, 914 F. 2d 1260, 1263 (CA9 1990) (rejecting as\n“frivolous” the argument that a party does not have\n“standing to object to orders specifically directing it to take\nor refrain from taking action”).\n   Respondents’ only argument to the contrary is that the\nsuperintendent answers to the State Board of Education,\nwhich in turn answers to the Governor, and that the Gov\nernor is the only Arizona official who “could have resolved\nthe conflict within the Executive Branch by directing an\nappeal.” Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 22. We need\nnot consider whether respondents’ chain-of-command\nargument has merit because the Governor has, in fact,\ndirected an appeal. See App. to Reply Brief for Petitioner\nSuperintendent 1 (“I hereby direct [the State attorney\ngeneral] to file a brief at the [Supreme] Court on behalf of\nthe State of Arizona adopting and joining in the positions\ntaken by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate”).\n   Because the superintendent clearly has standing to\nchallenge the lower courts’ decisions, we need not consider\nwhether the Legislators also have standing to do so.2 See,\ne.g., Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Develop\nment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264, and n. 9 (1977) (“[W]e have\nat least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated\nstanding . . . . Because of the presence of this plaintiff, we\n——————\n  2 We do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that\n\n“the Superintendent’s standing is limited” to seeking vacatur of the\nDistrict Court’s orders “only as they run against him.” 516 F. 3d, at\n1165. Had the superintendent sought relief based on satisfaction of the\njudgment, the Court of Appeals’ conclusion might have been correct.\nBut as discussed infra, at 15–16, petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not\nbased on satisfaction of the judgment. Their claim is that continued\nenforcement of the District Court’s orders would be inequitable. This\nclaim implicates the orders in their entirety, and not solely as they run\nagainst the superintendent.\n\f10                        HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nneed not consider whether the other individual and corpo\nrate plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit”). Ac\ncordingly, we proceed to the merits of petitioners’ Rule\n60(b)(5) motion.\n                              III \n\n                               A\n\n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) permits a party\nto obtain relief from a judgment or order if, among other\nthings, “applying [the judgment or order] prospectively is\nno longer equitable.” Rule 60(b)(5) may not be used to\nchallenge the legal conclusions on which a prior judgment\nor order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a\nparty can ask a court to modify or vacate a judgment or\norder if “a significant change either in factual conditions\nor in law” renders continued enforcement “detrimental to\nthe public interest.” Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County\nJail, 502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992). The party seeking relief\nbears the burden of establishing that changed circum\nstances warrant relief, id., at 383, but once a party carries\nthis burden, a court abuses its discretion “when it refuses\nto modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such\nchanges.” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 215 (1997).\n  Rule 60(b)(5) serves a particularly important function in\nwhat we have termed “institutional reform litigation.”3\n——————\n   3 The dissent is quite wrong in contending that these are not institu\n\ntional reform cases because they involve a statutory, rather than a\nconstitutional claim, and because the orders of the District Court do not\nmicromanage the day-to-day operation of the schools. Post, at 26\n(opinion of BREYER, J.). For nearly a decade, the orders of a federal\ndistrict court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of\nArizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appro\npriations, and budget priorities. The record strongly suggests that\nsome state officials have welcomed the involvement of the federal court\nas a means of achieving appropriations objectives that could not be\nachieved through the ordinary democratic process. See supra, at 5–6.\nBecause of these features, these cases implicate all of the unique\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)       11\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nRufo, supra, at 380. For one thing, injunctions issued in\nsuch cases often remain in force for many years, and the\npassage of time frequently brings about changed circum\nstances—changes in the nature of the underlying problem,\nchanges in governing law or its interpretation by the\ncourts, and new policy insights—that warrant reexamina\ntion of the original judgment.\n   Second, institutional reform injunctions often raise\nsensitive federalism concerns. Such litigation commonly\ninvolves areas of core state responsibility, such as public\neducation. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 99\n(1995) (“[O]ur cases recognize that local autonomy of\nschool districts is a vital national tradition, and that a\ndistrict court must strive to restore state and local au\nthorities to the control of a school system operating in\ncompliance with the Constitution” (citations omitted));\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 580 (1995)\n(KENNEDY, J., concurring).\n   Federalism concerns are heightened when, as in these\ncases, a federal court decree has the effect of dictating\nstate or local budget priorities. States and local govern\nments have limited funds. When a federal court orders\nthat money be appropriated for one program, the effect is\noften to take funds away from other important programs.\nSee Jenkins, supra, at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (“A\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State’s discretion\nary authority over its own program and budgets and forces\nstate officials to reallocate state resources and funds”).\n   Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation\ndiffer from those of other cases. Scholars have noted that\npublic officials sometimes consent to, or refrain from\nvigorously opposing, decrees that go well beyond what is\nrequired by federal law. See, e.g., McConnell, Why Hold\nElections? Using Consent Decrees to Insulate Policies\n—————— \n\nfeatures and risks of institutional reform litigation. \n\n\f12                   HORNE v.

Where “state and local\nofficials. . . inherit overbroad or outdated consent decrees\nthat limit their ability to respond to the priorities and\nconcerns of their constituents,” they are constrained in\ntheir ability to fulfill their duties as democratically-elected\nofficials. American Legislative Exchange Council, Resolu\ntion on the Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act (2006),\nApp. to Brief for American Legislative Exchange Council\net al. as Amici Curiae 1a–4a.\n   It goes without saying that federal courts must vigi\nlantly enforce federal law and must not hesitate in award\ning necessary relief. But in recognition of the features of\ninstitutional reform decrees, we have held that courts\nmust take a “flexible approach” to Rule 60(b)(5) motions\naddressing such decrees. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 381. A flexi\nble approach allows courts to ensure that “responsibility\nfor discharging the State’s obligations is returned\npromptly to the State and its officials” when the circum\nstances warrant. Frew, supra, at 442. In applying this\nflexible approach, courts must remain attentive to the fact\nthat “federal-court decrees exceed appropriate limits if\nthey are aimed at eliminating a condition that does not\nviolate [federal law] or does not flow from such a viola\ntion.” Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977). “If [a\nfederal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and\nnecessary implementations of federal law,” it may “im\nproperly deprive future officials of their designated legis\nlative and executive powers.” Frew, supra, at 441.\n   For these reasons, a critical question in this Rule\n60(b)(5) inquiry is whether the objective of the District\nCourt’s 2000 declaratory judgment order—i.e., satisfaction\nof the EEOA’s “appropriate action” standard—has been\nachieved. See 540 U. S., at 442. If a durable remedy has\nbeen implemented, continued enforcement of the order is\nnot only unnecessary, but improper. See Milliken, supra,\nat 282. We note that the EEOA itself limits court-ordered\n\f14                        HORNE v.

S. C. §1712 (emphasis added).\n                            B\n  The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5)\nanalysis just described. Rather than applying a flexible\nstandard that seeks to return control to state and local\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been\nremedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened stan\ndard that paid insufficient attention to federalism con\ncerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether\nchanged conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an\nELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of\nAppeals concerned itself only with determining whether\nincreased ELL funding complied with the original declara\ntory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.\n                                1\n   The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion\nby citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F. 3d, at 1163\n(noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of “ ‘a\nsignificant change either in factual conditions or in law’ ”),\nbut it quickly strayed. It referred to the situations in\nwhich changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief\nas “likely rare,” id., at 1167, and explained that, to succeed\non these grounds, petitioners would have to make a show\ning that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to “sweep\naway” the District Court’s incremental funding determina\ntion, id., at 1168. The Court of Appeals concluded that the\nDistrict Court had not erred in determining that “the\nlandscape was not so radically changed as to justify relief\nfrom judgment without compliance.” Id., at 1172 (empha\nsis added).4\n——————\n  4 The dissent conveniently dismisses the Court of Appeals’ statements\n\nby characterizing any error that exists as “one of tone, not of law,” and\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  15\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Moreover, after recognizing that review of the denial of\nRule 60(b)(5) relief should generally be “somewhat closer\nin the context of institutional injunctions against states\n‘due to federalism concerns,’ ” the Court of Appeals incor\nrectly reasoned that “federalism concerns are substan\ntially lessened here, as the state of Arizona and the state\nBoard of Education wish the injunction to remain in\nplace.” Id., at 1164. This statement is flatly incorrect, as\neven respondents acknowledge. Brief for Respondent\nState of Arizona et al. 20–21. Precisely because different\nstate actors have taken contrary positions in this litiga\ntion, federalism concerns are elevated. And precisely\nbecause federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible\napproach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical. “[W]hen the\nobjects of the decree have been attained”—namely, when\nEEOA compliance has been achieved—“responsibility for\ndischarging the State’s obligations [must be] returned\npromptly to the State and its officials.” Frew, 540 U. S., at\n442.\n                              2\n  In addition to applying a Rule 60(b)(5) standard that\nwas too strict, the Court of Appeals framed a Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry that was too narrow—one that focused almost\nexclusively on the sufficiency of incremental funding. In\nlarge part, this was driven by the significance the Court of\nAppeals attributed to petitioners’ failure to appeal the\nDistrict Court’s original order. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that “the central idea” of that order was that\nwithout sufficient ELL incremental funds, “ELL programs\nwould necessarily be inadequate.” 516 F. 3d, at 1167–\n—————— \n\nby characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context. Post, \n\nat 40–41. But we do read these statements in context—in the context \n\nof the Court of Appeals’ overall treatment of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5)\n\narguments—and it is apparent that they accurately reflect the Court of\n\nAppeals’ excessively narrow understanding of the role of Rule 60(b)(5).\n\n\f16                       HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n1168. It felt bound by this conclusion, lest it allow peti\ntioners to “reopen matters made final when the Declara\ntory Judgment was not appealed.” Id., at 1170. It re\npeated this refrain throughout its opinion, emphasizing\nthat the “interest in finality must be given great weight,”\nid., at 1163, and explaining that petitioners could not now\nask for relief “on grounds that could have been raised on\nappeal from the Declaratory Judgment and from earlier\ninjunctive orders but were not,” id., at 1167. “If [petition\ners] believed that the district court erred and should have\nlooked at all funding sources differently in its EEOA\ninquiry,” the court wrote, “they should have appealed the\nDeclaratory Judgment.” Id., at 1171.\n   In attributing such significance to the defendants’ fail\nure to appeal the District Court’s original order, the Court\nof Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litiga\ntion into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to\nthat of the original order, it insulated the policies embed\nded in the order—specifically, its incremental funding\nrequirement—from challenge and amendment.5 But those\npolicies were supported by the very officials who could\nhave appealed them—the state defendants—and, as a\nresult, were never subject to true challenge.\n   Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of\nAppeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry prescribed in Rufo. This inquiry makes no refer\nence to the presence or absence of a timely appeal. It\n\n——————\n  5 This does not mean, as the dissent misleadingly suggests, see post,\n\nat 22, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide\nwhether the District Court’s original order was correct in the first\nplace. On the contrary, as we state explicitly in the paragraph follow\ning this statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not\nengage in the changed-circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo v.\nInmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992). By focusing\nexcessively on the issue of incremental funding, the Court of Appeals\nwas not true to the Rufo standard.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           17\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ntakes the original judgment as a given and asks only\nwhether “a significant change either in factual conditions\nor in law” renders continued enforcement of the judgment\n“detrimental to the public interest.” Rufo, 502 U. S., at\n384. It allows a court to recognize that the longer an\ninjunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the\nrisk that it will improperly interfere with a State’s democ\nratic processes.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a “changed\ncircumstances” inquiry, but it asked only whether changed\ncircumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifi\ncally, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate,\nin the court’s view, only if petitioners “demonstrate[d]\neither that there [we]re no longer incremental costs asso\nciated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona’s\n‘base plus incremental costs’ educational funding model\nwas so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental\ncosts funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.” 516\nF. 3d, at 1169.\n   This was a Rule 60(b)(5) “changed circumstances” in\nquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into\nwhether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that\nthe District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.\nAnd this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the\noriginal order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier\njudgment is one of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief—but it is not the only basis for such relief.\n   Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where “[i]\nthe judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged;\n[ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been re\nversed or vacated; or [iii] applying it prospectively is no\nlonger equitable.” (Emphasis added.) Use of the disjunc\ntive “or” makes it clear that each of the provision’s three\ngrounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore\nthat relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not\n“satisfied” the original order. As petitioners argue, they\n\f18                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nmay obtain relief if prospective enforcement of that order\n“is no longer equitable.”\n   To determine the merits of this claim, the Court of\nAppeals needed to ascertain whether ongoing enforcement\nof the original order was supported by an ongoing violation\nof federal law (here, the EEOA). See Milliken, 433 U. S.,\nat 282. It failed to do so.\n   As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State\nto take “appropriate action to overcome language barri\ners,” 20 U. S. C. §1703(f), “leave[s] state and local educa\ntional authorities a substantial amount of latitude in\nchoosing” how this obligation is met. Castaneda, 648\nF. 2d, at 1009. Of course, any educational program, in\ncluding the “appropriate action” mandated by the EEOA,\nrequires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the\nend. By focusing so intensively on Arizona’s incremental\nELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the\nEEOA’s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demon\nstrate “appropriate action” through a particular funding\nmechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted\nits own educational and budgetary policy judgments for\nthose of the state and local officials to whom such deci\nsions are properly entrusted. Cf. Jenkins, 515 U. S., at\n131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (“Federal courts do not pos\nsess the capabilities of state and local governments in\naddressing difficult educational problems”).\n                            C\n   The underlying District Court opinion reveals similar\nerrors. In an August 2006 remand order, a different Ninth\nCircuit panel had instructed the District Court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing “regarding whether changed circum\nstances required modification of the original court order or\notherwise had a bearing on the appropriate remedy.” 204\nFed. Appx., at 582. The Ninth Circuit panel observed that\n“federal courts must be sensitive to the need for modifica\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                   19\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ntion [of permanent injunctive relief] when circumstances\nchange.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The District Court failed to follow these instructions.\nInstead of determining whether changed circumstances\nwarranted modification of the original order, the District\nCourt asked only whether petitioners had satisfied the\noriginal declaratory judgment order through increased\nincremental funding. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (ex\nplaining that a showing of “mere amelioration” of the\nspecific deficiencies noted in the District Court’s original\norder was “inadequate” and that “compliance would re\nquire a funding system that rationally relates funding\navailable to the actual costs of all elements of ELL in\nstruction” (emphasis added)). The District Court stated:\n“It should be noted that the Court finds the same problems\ntoday that it saw last year, because HB 2064 is the same,\nthe problems themselves are the same.6 Id., at 1161. The\n——————\n  6 In addition to concluding that the law’s increase in incremental\n\nfunding was insufficient and that 2-year cutoff was irrational, both the\nDistrict Court and the Court of Appeals held that HB 2064’s funding\nmechanism violates NCLB, which provides in relevant part: “A State\nshall not take into consideration payments under this chapter . . . in\ndetermining the eligibility of any local educational agency in that State\nfor State aid, or the amount of State aid, with respect to free public\neducation of children.” 20 U. S. C. §7902. See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1166\n(HB 2064’s funding mechanism is “absolutely forbidden” by §7902); 516\nF. 3d, at 1178 (“HB 2064 . . . violates [§7902] on its face”). Whether or\nnot HB 2064 violates §7902, see Brief for United States as Amicus\nCuriae 31–32, and n. 8 (suggesting it does), neither court below was\nempowered to decide the issue. As the Court of Appeals itself recog\nnized, NCLB does not provide a private right of action. See 516 F. 3d,\nat 1175. “Without [statutory intent], a cause of action does not exist\nand courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be\nas a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.” Alexander v.\nSandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286–287 (2001). Thus, NCLB is enforceable\nonly by the agency charged with administering it. See id., at 289–290;\nsee also App. to Brief for Respondent State of Arizona et al. 1–4 (letter\nfrom U. S. Department of Education to petitioner superintendent\nconcerning the legality vel non of HB 2064).\n\f20                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nDistrict Court thus rested its postremand decision on its\npreremand analysis of HB 2064. It disregarded the re\nmand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances\nwarranted relief. In taking this approach, the District\nCourt abused its discretion.\n                              D\n   The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower\ncourts with four principal conclusions that it draws from\nthe record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect\nand mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts—a\nfixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure\nto recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.\n   First, the dissent concludes that “the Rule 60(b)(5)\n‘changes’ upon which the District Court focused” were not\nlimited to changes in funding, and included “ ‘changed\nteaching methods’ ” and “ ‘changed administrative sys\ntems.’ ” Post, at 12. The District Court did note a range of\nchanged circumstances, concluding that as a result of\nthese changes, Nogales was “doing substantially better.”\n480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. But it neither focused on these\nchanges nor made up-to-date factual findings. To the\ncontrary, the District Court explained that “it would be\npremature to make an assessment of some of these\nchanges.” Ibid. Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that\nthe court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed fund\ning directly and exclusively. See id., at 1161–1163. The\nlast eight addressed funding indirectly—discussing reclas\nsification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064’s\nfunding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students.\nSee id., at 1163–1165. None of the District Court’s find\nings of fact addressed either “ ‘changed teaching methods’ ”\nor “ ‘changed administrative systems.’ ”\n   The dissent’s second conclusion is that “ ‘incremental\nfunding’ costs . . . [were] the basic contested issue at the\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)                  21\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n2000 trial and the sole basis for the District Court’s find\ning of a statutory violation.” Post, at 12. We fail to see\nthis conclusion’s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nwhere the question is whether any change in factual or\nlegal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the\noriginal order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowl\nedges, petitioners “pointed to three sets of changed cir\ncumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their\nview, showed that the judgment and the related orders\nwere no longer necessary.” Post, at 11. In addition to\n“increases in the amount of funding available to Arizona\nschool districts,” these included “changes in the method of\nEnglish-learning instruction,” and “changes in the admini\nstration of the Nogales school district.” Ibid.\n  Third, the dissent concludes that “the type of issue upon\nwhich the District Court and Court of Appeals focused”—\nthe incremental funding issue—“lies at the heart of the\nstatutory demand for equal educational opportunity.”\nPost, at 13. In what we interpret to be a restatement of\nthis point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient fund\ning (“the ‘resource’ issue”) and the presence or absence of\nan EEOA violation (“the statutory subsection (f) issue”) “are\none and the same.” Post, at 14 (emphasis in original). “In\nfocusing upon the one,” the dissent asserts, “the District\nCourt and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.”\nIbid.\n  Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, these two issues are\ndecidedly not “one and the same.”7 Ibid. Nor is it the case,\nas the dissent suggests, that the EEOC targets States’\n——————\n  7 The extent to which the dissent repeats the errors of the courts be\n\nlow is evident in its statement that “[t]he question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to a ‘change’\nthat satisfies subsection (f)’s requirement.” Post, at 40 (emphasis\nadded). The proper inquiry is not limited to the issue of funding.\nRather, it encompasses the question whether the State has shown any\nfactual or legal changes that establish compliance with the EEOA.\n\f22                        HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nprovision of resources for ELL programming.8 Post, at 13.\nWhat the statute forbids is a failure to take “appropriate\naction to overcome language barriers.”          20 U. S. C.\n§1703(f). Funding is merely one tool that may be em\nployed to achieve the statutory objective.\n  Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did\nnot order increased ELL incremental funding and did not\ndictate state and local budget priorities. Post, at 15. The\ndissent’s point—and it is a very small one—is that the\nDistrict Court did not set a specific amount that the legis\nlature was required to appropriate. The District Court\ndid, however, hold the State in contempt and impose\nheavy fines because the legislature did not provide suffi\ncient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed\nimportant restrictions on the legislature’s ability to set\nbudget priorities.\n——————\n   8 The dissent cites two sources for this proposition.        The first—\nCastaneda v. Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989 (CA5 1981)—sets out a three-part\ntest for “appropriate action.” Under that test, a State must (1) formu\nlate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) imple\nment that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results. See id., at 1009–\n1010. Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance\nregarding the meaning of “appropriate action,” the test does not focus\non incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.\n   The second source cited by the dissent—curiously—is a speech given\nby President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on\nlegislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972. See post, at 13 (citing\nAddress to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)). In the speech, President\nNixon said that schools in poor neighborhoods should receive the\n“financial support . . . that we know can make all the difference.” Id.,\nat 593. It is likely that this statement had nothing to do with the\ninterpretation of EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement and instead\nreferred to his proposal to “direc[t] over $21⁄2 billion in the next year\nmainly towards improving the education of children from poor fami\nlies.” Id., at 591. But in any event, this general statement, made in a\npresidential speech two years prior to the enactment of the EEOA,\nsurely sheds little light on the proper interpretation of the statute.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

In\nNovember 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203,\nwhich mandated statewide implementation of a “struc\ntured English immersion” (SEI) approach. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08–294, p. 369a. Proposition 203\ndefines this methodology as follows:\n    “ ‘Sheltered English immersion’ or ‘structured English\n    immersion’ means an English language acquisition\n    process for young children in which nearly all class\n    room instruction is in English but with the curriculum\n    and presentation designed for children who are learn\n    ing the language. . . . Although teachers may use a\n    minimal amount of the child’s native language when\n    necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any\n    language other than English, and children in this pro\n    gram learn to read and write solely in English.” Ariz.\n    Rev. Stat. Ann. §15–751(5) (West 2009).\n  In HB 2064, the state legislature attended to the suc\n\f24                        HORNE v.

It required that all\nschool districts and charter schools select one of the\nadopted SEI models, §15–756.02(A), and it created an\n“Office of English language acquisition services” to aid\nschool districts in implementation of the models. §15–\n756.07(1). It also required the State Board of Education to\ninstitute a uniform and mandatory training program for\nall SEI instructors. §15–756.09.\n  Research on ELL instruction indicates there is docu\nmented, academic support for the view that SEI is signifi\ncantly more effective than bilingual education.10 Findings\nof the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004\nstrongly support this conclusion.11 In light of this, a\nproper analysis of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should\n——————\n   9 By focusing on the adequacy of HB 2064’s funding provisions, the\n\ncourts below neglected to address adequately the potential relevance of\nthese programming provisions, which became effective immediately\nupon enactment of the law.\n   10 See Brief for American Unity Legal Defense Fund et al. as Amici\n\nCuriae 10–12 (citing sources, including New York City Board of Educa\ntion, Educational Progress of Students in Bilingual and ESL Programs:\na Longitudinal Study, 1990–1994 (1994); K.

It reflects\nCongress’ judgment that the best way to raise the level of\neducation nationwide is by granting state and local offi\ncials flexibility to develop and implement educational\nprograms that address local needs, while holding them\naccountable for the results. NCLB implements this ap\nproach by requiring States receiving federal funds to\ndefine performance standards and to make regular as\nsessments of progress toward the attainment of those\nstandards. 20 U. S. C. §6311(b)(2). NCLB conditions the\ncontinued receipt of funds on demonstrations of “adequate\nyearly progress.” Ibid.\n   As relevant here, Title III (the English Language Acqui\nsition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achieve\nment Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students\n“attain English proficiency, develop high levels of aca\ndemic attainment in English, and meet the same challeng\ning State academic content and student academic\nachievement standards as all children are expected to\nmeet.” §6812(1). It requires States to set annual objective\nachievement goals for the number of students who will\nannually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency,\nand make “adequate yearly progress” with respect to\nacademic achievement, §6842(a), and it holds local schools\nand agencies accountable for meeting these objectives,\n§6842(b).\n   Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB,\nthe State has established compliance with the EEOA.\n\f26                       HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nThey note that when a State adopts a compliance plan\nunder NCLB—as the State of Arizona has—it must pro\nvide adequate assurances that ELL students will receive\nassistance “to achieve at high levels in the core academic\nsubjects so that those children can meet the same . . .\nstandards as all children are expected to meet.” §6812(2).\nThey argue that when the Federal Department of Educa\ntion approves a State’s plan—as it has with respect to\nArizona’s—it offers definitive evidence that the State has\ntaken “appropriate action to overcome language barriers”\nwithin the meaning of the EEOA. §1703(f).\n   The Court of Appeals concluded, and we agree, that\nbecause of significant differences in the two statutory\nschemes, compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\nconstitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA. 516\nF. 3d, at 1172–1176. Approval of a NCLB plan does not\nentail substantive review of a State’s ELL programming or\na determination that the programming results in equal\neducational opportunity for ELL students. See §6823.\nMoreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides\nthat “[n]othing in this part shall be construed in a manner\ninconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil\nright.” §6847.\n   This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant\nto petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion. To the contrary, we\nthink it is probative in four principal ways.12 First, it\n——————\n  12 Although the dissent contends that the sole argument raised below\nregarding NCLB was that compliance with that Act necessarily consti\ntuted compliance with the EEOA, the Court of Appeals recognized that\nNCLB is a relevant factor that should be considered under Rule\n60(b)(5). It acknowledged that compliance with NCLB is at least\n“somewhat probative” of compliance with the EEOA. 516 F. 3d, at\n1175, n. 46. The United States, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting\nrespondents, similarly observed that, “[e]ven though Title III participa\ntion is not a complete defense under the EEOA, whether a State is\nreaching its own goals under Title III may be relevant in an EEOA\nsuit.” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.

These changes should not be discounted in the\nRule 60(b)(5) analysis solely because they do not require or\nresult from increased funding. Second, NCLB signifi\ncantly increased federal funding for education in general\nand ELL programming in particular.14 These funds\nshould not be disregarded just because they are not state\nfunds. Third, through its assessment and reporting re\nquirements, NCLB provides evidence of the progress and\nachievement of Nogales’ ELL students.15 This evidence\ncould provide persuasive evidence of the current effective\nness of Nogales’ ELL programming.16\n——————\nCourt noted that, “[b]y increasing the standards of accountability,\n[NCLB] has to some extent significantly changed State educators\napproach to educating students in Arizona.” 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160–\n1161.\n  13 Among other things, the State Department of Education formulated\n\na compliance plan, approved by the U. S. Department of Education.\nThe State Board of Education promulgated statewide ELL proficiency\nstandards, adopted uniform assessment standards, and initiated\nprograms for monitoring school districts and training structured\nEnglish immersion teachers.

First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the\nabsence of longitudinal data in the record precludes useful compari\nsons. See id., at 1155. Second, the AIMS tests—the statewide\nachievement tests on which the Court of Appeals primarily relied and\nto which the dissent cites in Appendix A of its opinion—are adminis\ntered in English. It is inevitable that ELL students (who, by definition,\nare not yet proficient in English) will underperform as compared to\nnative speakers. Third, the negative data that the Court of Appeals\nhighlights is balanced by positive data. See, e.g., App. 97 (reporting\nthat for the 2005–2006 school year, on average, reclassified students\ndid as well as, if not better than, native English speakers on the AIMS\ntests).\n  17 See, e.g., Hanushek, The Failure of Input-Based Schooling Policies,\n\n113 Economic J.

The Court of Appeals recognized that\nby “[u]sing careful financial management and applying for\n‘all funds available,’ Cooper was able to achieve his re\nforms with limited resources.” Id., at 1157. But the Court\nof Appeals missed the legal import of this observation—\nthat these reforms might have brought Nogales’ ELL\nprogramming into compliance with the EEOA even with\nout sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the\nDistrict Court’s original order. Instead, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded that to credit Cooper’s reforms would\n“penaliz[e]” Nogales “for doing its best to make do, despite\nArizona’s failure to comply with the terms of the judg\nment,” and would “absolve the state from providing ade\nquate ELL incremental funding as required by the judg\nment.”    Id., at 1168.      The District Court similarly\ndiscounted Cooper’s achievements, acknowledging that\nNogales was “doing substantially better than it was in\n2000,” but concluding that because the progress resulted\nfrom management efforts rather than increased funding,\nits progress was “fleeting at best.” 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160.\n   Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding,\nboth courts refused to consider that Nogales could be\ntaking “appropriate action” to address language barriers\neven without having satisfied the original order. This was\nerror. The EEOA seeks to provide “equal educational\nopportunity” to “all children enrolled in public schools.”\n§1701(a). Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educa\ntional programming and services provided to students, not\nthe amount of money spent on them. Accordingly, there is\nno statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing\nthat Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming\nby means other than increased funding—for example,\nthrough Cooper’s structural, curricular, and accountabil\nity-based reforms. The weight of research suggests that\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U.

Addendum to Reply Brief for Petitioner Speaker of\nthe Arizona House of Representatives et al. 15.\n   The Court of Appeals discounted Cooper’s reforms for\nother reasons as well. It explained that while they “did\nameliorate many of the specific examples of resource\nshortages that the district court identified in 2000,” they\ndid not “result in such success as to call into serious ques\ntion [Nogales’] need for increased incremental funds.” 516\nF. 3d, at 1169. Among other things, the Court of Appeals\nreferred to “the persistent achievement gaps documented\nin [Nogales’] AIMS test data” between ELL students and\nnative speakers, id., at 1170, but any such comparison\nmust take into account other variables that may explain\nthe gap. In any event, the EEOA requires “appropriate\naction” to remove language barriers, §1703(f), not the\nequalization of results between native and nonnative\nspeakers on tests administered in English—a worthy goal,\nto be sure, but one that may be exceedingly difficult to\nachieve, especially for older ELL students.\n   The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar per\nformance of Nogales’ high schools. There is no doubt that\nNogales’ high schools represent an area of weakness, but\nthe District Court made insufficient factual findings to\nsupport a conclusion that the high schools’ problems stem\nfrom a failure to take “appropriate action,” and constitute\n\n——————\n  19 See, e.g., M.

A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this\nand should ask whether, as a result of structural and\nmanagerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal\neducational opportunities to ELL students.\n                             4\n  A fourth potentially important change is an overall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.\nThe original declaratory judgment order noted five sources\nof funding that collectively financed education in the\nState: (1) the State’s “base level” funding, (2) ELL incre\nmental funding, (3) federal grants, (4) regular district and\ncounty taxes, and (5) special voter-approved district and\ncounty taxes called “overrides.” 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1227.\nAll five sources have notably increased since 2000.21\nNotwithstanding these increases, the Court of Appeals\nrejected petitioners’ claim that overall education funds\n——————\n  20 There are many possible causes for the performance of students in\n\nNogales’ high school ELL programs. These include the difficulty of\nteaching English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were\nnot in English-speaking schools as younger students) and problems,\nsuch as drug use and the prevalence of gangs. See Reply Brief for\nPetitioner Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 14–\n15; Reply Brief for Petitioner Superintendent 16–17; App. 116–118. We\nnote that no court has made particularized findings as to the effective\nness of ELL programming offered at Nogales’ high schools.\n  21 The Court of Appeals reported, and it is not disputed, that “[o]n an\n\ninflation-adjusted statewide basis, including all sources of funding,\nsupport for education has increased from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to an\nestimated $3,570 per pupil in 2006. Adding in all county and local\nsources, funding has gone from $5,677 per pupil in 2000 to an esti\nmated $6,412 per pupil in 2006. Finally, federal funding has increased.\nIn 2000, the federal government provided an additional $526 per pupil;\nin 2006, it provided an estimated $953.” 516 F. 3d, at 1155.\n\f                    Cite as: 557 U.

The court reasoned that diverting base-level\neducation funds would necessarily hurt other state educa\ntional programs, and was not, therefore, an “ ‘appropriate’\nstep.” 516 F. 3d, at 1171. In so doing, it foreclosed the\npossibility that petitioners could establish changed cir\ncumstances warranting relief through an overall increase\nin education funding available in Nogales.\n   This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the\nEEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement does not neces\nsarily require any particular level of funding, and to the\nextent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does\nnot require that the money come from any particular\nsource. In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the\nfederal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a\nschool district is providing “appropriate” instruction in\nother subjects. That remains the province of the States\nand the local schools. It is unfortunate if a school, in order\nto fund ELL programs, must divert money from other\nworthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the\nscope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petition\ners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the\nState’s budget for general education funding, in addition\nto any local revenues,22 is currently supporting EEOA\ncompliant ELL programming in Nogales.\n   Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to\nmake up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower\ncourts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all\nof the changed circumstances just noted. These changes\nare critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as\nthey may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of\n——————\n  22 Each year since 2000, Nogales voters have passed an override.\n\nRevenues from Nogales’ override have increased from $895,891 in 2001\nto $1,674,407 in 2007.

If this\nis the case, continued enforcement of the District Court’s\noriginal order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule\n60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.\n                              IV\n   We turn, finally, to the District Court’s entry of state\nwide relief.23 The Nogales district, which is situated along\nthe Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the\nState of Arizona. Nogales students make up about one\nhalf of one per cent of the entire State’s school popula\ntion.24 The record contains no factual findings or evidence\nthat any school district other than Nogales failed (much\nless continues to fail) to provide equal educational oppor\ntunities to ELL students. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08–294, pp. 177a–178a. Nor have respondents explained\nhow the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when\nthe only violation claimed or proven was limited to a\nsingle district. See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 89–90; Milliken,\n433 U. S., at 280. It is not even clear that the District\nCourt had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\n——————\n   23 The dissent contends that this issue was not raised below, but what\n\nis important for present purposes is that, for the reasons explained in\nthe previous parts of this opinion, these cases must be remanded to the\nDistrict Court for a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis. Petitioners made it\nclear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63 (“Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to apply state\nwide. That has not been done before. It should not have been done in\nthe first instance but certainly in light of the changed circumstances”);\nsee also id., at 17–18, 21, 26. Accordingly, if petitioners raise that\nargument on remand, the District Court must consider whether there is\nany legal or factual basis for denying that relief.\n   24 See Ariz.

S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nwhen it is not apparent that plaintiffs—a class of Nogales\nstudents and their parents—had standing to seek such\nrelief.\n   The only explanation proffered for the entry of statewide\nrelief was based on an interpretation of the Arizona Con\nstitution. We are told that the former attorney general\n“affirmatively urged a statewide remedy because a ‘No\ngales only’ remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Consti\ntution’s requirement of ‘a general and uniform public\nschool system.’ ” Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 38\n(quoting Ariz. Const., Art. 11, §1(A) (some internal quota\ntion marks omitted)).\n   This concern did not provide a valid basis for a state\nwide federal injunction. If the state attorney general\nbelieved that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL\nspending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state\nlaw, a similar increase in every other district in the State,\nthe attorney general could have taken the matter to the\nstate legislature or the state courts. But the attorney\ngeneral did not do so. Even if she had, it is not clear what\nthe result would have been. It is a question of state law,\nto be determined by state authorities, whether the equal\nfunding provision of the Arizona Constitution would re\nquire a statewide funding increase to match Nogales’ ELL\nfunding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled\nexception. By failing to recognize this, and by entering a\nstatewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State’s\nbudgetary processes based solely on the attorney general’s\ninterpretation of state law, the District Court obscured\naccountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.\n   When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the\nwork of the Federal or State Government, accountability is\ndiminished. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,\n169 (1992). Here, the District Court “improperly pre\nvent[ed] the citizens of the State from addressing the issue\n[of statewide relief] through the processes provided by the\n\f36                   HORNE v.

Assuming\nthat petitioners, on remand, press their objection to the\nstatewide extension of the remedy, the District Court\nshould vacate the injunction insofar as it extends beyond\nNogales unless the court concludes that Arizona is violat\ning the EEOA on a statewide basis.\n  There is no question that the goal of the EEOA—\novercoming language barriers—is a vitally important one,\nand our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to\nachieve that goal. If petitioners are ultimately granted\nrelief from the judgment, it will be because they have\nshown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly\nwhat this statute requires—taking “appropriate action” to\nteach English to students who grew up speaking another\nlanguage.\n                       *   *     *\n  We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and\nremand the cases for the District Court to determine\nwhether, in accordance with the standards set out in this\nopinion, petitioners should be granted relief from the\njudgment.\n                                         It is so ordered.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The judgment held that the\nState of Arizona’s plan for funding its English Language\nLearner program was arbitrary, and therefore the State\nhad failed to take “appropriate action to overcome lan­\nguage barriers that impede equal participation by its”\nSpanish-speaking public school students “in its instruc­\ntional programs.” 20 U. S. C. §1703(f); Castaneda v.\nPickard, 648 F. 2d 989, 1010 (CA5 1981) (interpreting\n“appropriate action” to include the provision of “necessary”\nfinancial and other “resources”).

Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,\n502 U. S. 367, 384 (1992), entitled them to relief. The\nState of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the\noriginal plaintiffs in the case (representing students from\nNogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent’s Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. They are respondents here.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence and holding\neight days of hearings, considered all the changed circum­\nstances that the parties called to its attention. The court\nconcluded that some relevant “changes” had taken place.\nBut the court ultimately found those changes insufficient\nto warrant setting aside the original judgment. The Court\nof Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, af­\nfirmed that district court determination. This Court now\nsets the Court of Appeals’ decision aside. And it does so, it\nsays, because “the lower courts focused excessively on the\nnarrow question of the adequacy of the State’s incremental\nfunding for [English-learning] instruction instead of fairly\nconsidering the broader question, whether, as a result of\nimportant changes during the intervening years, the State\nwas fulfilling its obligation” under the Act “by other\nmeans.” Ante, at 2 (emphasis added).\n   The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion—that the\nlower courts did not “fairly consider” the changed circum­\nstances—in a complicated way. It begins by placing this\ncase in a category it calls “institutional reform litigation.”\nAnte, at 10. It then sets forth special “institutional reform\nlitigation” standards applicable when courts are asked to\nmodify judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It\napplies those standards, and finds that the lower courts\ncommitted error.\n   I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one\nthing, the “institutional reform” label does not easily fit\nthis case. For another, the review standards the Court\nenunciates for “institutional reform” cases are incomplete\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            3\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nand, insofar as the Court applies those standards here,\nthey effectively distort Rule 60(b)(5)’s objectives. Finally,\nmy own review of the record convinces me that the Court\nis wrong regardless. The lower courts did “fairly consider”\nevery change in circumstances that the parties called to\ntheir attention. The record more than adequately supports\nthis conclusion. In a word, I fear that the Court misap­\nplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a\nresult that neither the record nor the law adequately\nsupports. In doing so, it risks denying schoolchildren the\nEnglish-learning instruction necessary “to overcome lan­\nguage barriers that impede” their “equal participation.”\n20 U. S. C. §1703(f).\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n  To understand my disagreement with the Court, it is\nunfortunately necessary to examine the record at length\nand in detail. I must initially focus upon the Court’s basic\ncriticism of the lower courts’ analysis, namely that the\nlower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees.\nIn the majority’s view, those courts—as well as this dis­\nsent—wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, “incre­\nmental” English-learning program “funding,” rather than\nthe basic matter, whether “changes” had cured, or had\ncome close to curing, the violation of federal law that\nunderlay the original judgment. Ante, at 2. In the Court’s\nview, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to\ndissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon\nthe school district’s failure to purchase 50 decree-required\nschool buses, instead of discussing the basic question,\nwhether the schools had become integrated without need\nfor those 50 buses.\n  Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so\nheavily on the original decree’s “incremental funding”\nrequirement that they failed to ask whether “the State\n\f4                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwas fulfilling its obligation under” federal law “by other\nmeans.” Ibid. And the Court frequently criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for having “focused almost exclusively on\nthe sufficiency of incremental funding,” ante, at 15; for\n“confining the scope of its analysis to” the “incremental\nfunding requirement,” ante, at 16; for having “asked only\nwhether changed circumstances affected [English­\nlearning] funding and, more specifically . . . incremental\nfunding,” ante, at 17; for inquiring only “into whether the\ndeficiency in . . . incremental funding that the District\nCourt identified in 2000 had been remedied,” ibid.; and (in\ncase the reader has not yet gotten the point) for “focusing\nso intensively on Arizona’s incremental . . . funding,” ante.,\nat 18. The Court adds that the District Court too was\nwrong to have “asked only whether petitioners had satis­\nfied the original declaratory judgment order through\nincreased incremental funding.” Ante, at 19.\n   The problem with this basic criticism is that the State’s\nprovision of adequate resources to its English-learning\nstudents, i.e., what the Court refers to as “incremental\nfunding,” has always been the basic contested issue in this\ncase. That is why the lower courts continuously focused\nattention directly upon it. In the context of this case they\nlooked directly at the forest, not the trees. To return to\nthe school desegregation example, the court focused upon\nthe heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not\nupon the number of buses the school district had pur­\nchased. A description of the statutory context and the\nhistory of this case makes clear that the Court cannot\nsensibly drive a wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it\ncalls the “incremental funding” issue and the uncured\nfailure to comply with the requirements of federal law.\n                              1\n  The lawsuit filed in this case charged a violation of\nsubsection (f) of §204 of the Equal Educational Opportuni­\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npriate” so as to recognize both the obligation to take ac­\ncount of “the need of limited English speaking children for\nlanguage assistance” and the fact that the “governance” of\nprimary and secondary education ordinarily “is properly\nreserved to . . . state and local educational agencies.” Id.,\nat 1008, 1009.\n   The court concluded that a court applying subsection (f)\nshould engage in three inquiries. First, the court should\n“ascertain” whether the school system, in respect to stu­\ndents who are not yet proficient in English, “is pursuing”\nan English-learning program that is “informed by an\neducational theory recognized as sound by some experts in\nthe field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental\nstrategy.” Ibid. Second, that court should determine\n“whether the programs and practices actually used by\n[the] school system are reasonably calculated to imple­\nment effectively the educational theory adopted by the\nschool,” which is to say that the school system must “fol­\nlow through with practices, resources and personnel neces­\nsary to transform” its chosen educational theory “into\nreality.” Id., at 1010 (emphasis added). Third, if prac­\ntices, resources, and personnel are adequate, the court\nshould go on to ascertain whether there is some indication\nthat the programs produce “results,” i.e., that “the lan­\nguage barriers confronting students are actually being\novercome.” Ibid.\n   Courts in other Circuits have followed Castaneda’s\napproach. See, e.g., Gomez v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ.,\n811 F. 2d 1030, 1041 (CA7 1987); United States v. Texas,\n680 F. 2d 356, 371 (CA5 1982); Valeria G. v. Wilson, 12\nF. Supp. 2d 1007, 1017–1018 (ND Cal 1998). No Circuit\nCourt has denied its validity. And no party in this case\ncontests the District Court’s decision to use Castaneda’s\nthree-part standard in the case before us.\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

In 1992, they\nfiled the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its\nBoard of Education, and the superintendent, claiming that\nthe State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to\nadopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing “to\nprovide financial and other resources necessary” to make\nthose programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking\nstudents. App. 7, ¶20 (emphasis added); see Castaneda,\nsupra, at 1010 (second, i.e., “resource,” requirement). In\nparticular, they said, “[t]he cost” of programs that would\nallow those students to learn effectively, say, to read\nEnglish at a proficient level, “far exceeds the only financial\nassistance the State theoretically provides.” App. 7,\n¶20(a).\n   The students sought a declaration that the State had\n“systematically . . . failed or refused to provide fiscal as\nwell as other resources sufficient to enable” the Nogales\nSchool District and other “similarly situated [school] dis­\ntricts” to “establish and maintain” successful programs for\nEnglish learners. Id., at 10, ¶28. And they sought an\nappropriate injunction requiring the provision of such\nresources. The state defendants answered the com­\nplaint. And after resolving disagreements on various\nsubsidiary issues, see id., at 19–30, the parties proceeded\nto trial on the remaining disputed issue in the case,\nnamely whether the State and its education authorities\n“adequately fund and oversee” their English-learning\nprogram. 172 F. Supp. 2d 1225, 1226 (Ariz. 2000) (empha­\nsis added).\n   In January 2000, after a three-day bench trial, the\n\f8                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nDistrict Court made 64 specific factual findings, including\nthe following:\n  (1) The State assumes that its school districts need (and\nwill obtain from local and statewide sources) funding\nequal to a designated “base level amount” per child—\nreflecting the funding required to educate a “typical”\nstudent, 516 F. 3d 1140, 1147 (CA9 2008)—along with an\nadditional amount needed to educate each child with\nspecial educational needs, including those children who\nare not yet proficient in English. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1227–1228.\n  (2) In the year 2000, the “base level amount” the State\nassumed necessary to educate a typical child amounted to\nroughly $3,174 (in year 2000 dollars). Id., at 1227.\n  (3) A cost study conducted by the State in 1988 showed\nthat, at that time, English-learning programming cost\nschool districts an additional $424 per English-learning\nchild. Id., at 1228. Adjusted for inflation to the year 2000,\nthe extra cost per student of the State’s English-learning\nprogram was $617 per English-learning child.\n  (4) In the year 2000, the State’s funding formula pro­\nvided school districts with only $150 to pay for the $617 in\nextra costs per child that the State assumed were needed\nto pay for its English-learning program. Id., at 1229.\n  The record contains no suggestion that Nogales, or any\nother school district, could readily turn anywhere but to\nthe State to find the $467 per-student difference between\nthe amount the State assumed was needed and the\namount that it made available. See id., at 1230. Nor does\nthe record contain any suggestion that Nogales or any\nother school district could have covered additional costs by\nredistributing “base level,” typical-child funding it re­\nceived. (In the year 2000 Arizona, compared with other\nStates, provided the third-lowest amount of funding per\nchild. U. S.

Supp. 2d, at 1239. The\ncourt added that the State’s provision of financial re­\nsources was “not reasonably calculated to effectively im­\nplement” the English-learning program chosen by the\nState. Ibid. Hence, the State had failed to take “appro­\npriate action” to teach English to non-English-speaking\nstudents, in that it had failed (in Castaneda’s words) to\nprovide the “practices, resources, and personnel” necessary\nto make its chosen educational theory a “reality.” Id., at\n1238–1239; see also §1703(f); Castaneda, 648 F. 2d, at\n1010.\n   The District Court consequently entered judgment in\nthe students’ favor. The court later entered injunctions (1)\nrequiring the State to “prepare a cost study to establish\nthe proper appropriation to effectively implement” the\nState’s own English-learning program, and (2) requiring\nthe State to develop a funding mechanism that would bear\nsome “reasonabl[e]” or “rational relatio[n] to the actual\nfunding needed” to ensure that non-English-speaking\nstudents would “achieve mastery” of the English language.\nSee, e.g., 160 F.

Supp. 2d\n1112, 1120 (Ariz. 2005).\n   In early 2006, the state legislature began to consider HB\n2064, a bill that, among other things, provided for the\ncreation of a “Task Force” charged to develop “cost­\nefficient” methods for teaching English. The bill would\nalso increase the appropriation for teaching English to\nstudents who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the\nspending of any increase upon any particular student for\nmore than two years). In March 2006, the petitioners here\n(the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nPresident of Arizona’s Senate, and the Speaker of its\nHouse of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to\nconsider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its\njudgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the con­\ntempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to\ndissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the\n2000 judgment.

The “sig­\nnificant changed circumstances” identified amounted to\nchanges in the very circumstances that underlay the initial\nfinding of violation, namely Arizona’s funding-based fail­\nure to provide adequate English-learning educational\nresources. The moving parties asserted that “Arizona has\npoured money” into Nogales as a result of various funding\nchanges, id., at 5.

Id., at 5–8.\nThe parties said that, in light of these “dramatic” addi­\ntions to the funding available for education in Arizona, the\ncourt should “declare the judgment and orders satisfied,\nand . . . relieve defendants from the judgment and orders\nunder Rule 60(b)(5).” Id., at 8.\n   In April 2006, the District Court held that HB 2064 by\nitself did not adequately satisfy the court’s orders; it de­\nnied the request to forgive the fines; but it did not decide\nthe petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion. In August 2006, the\nCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that\nmotion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to\n“the landscape of educational funding . . . required modifi­\ncation of the original court order or otherwise had a bear­\ning on the appropriate remedy.” 204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582\n(CA9 2006) (memorandum).\n   In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that\nlasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript\nof 1,684 pages. The hearing focused on the changes that\nthe petitioners said had occurred and justified setting\naside the original judgment. The petitioners pointed to\nthree sets of changed circumstances—all related to “prac­\ntices, resources, and personnel”—which, in their view,\nshowed that the judgment and the related orders were no\nlonger necessary. They argued that the changes had\nbrought the State into compliance with the Act’s require­\nments. The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases\nin the amount of funding available to Arizona school dis­\ntricts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning in­\nstruction; and (3) changes in the administration of the\nNogales school district. These changes, the petitioners\nsaid, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were\nnoted in the District Court’s 2000 judgment, 172 F. Supp.\n2d, at 1239, and rendered enforcement of the judgment\nand related orders unnecessary.\n   Based on the hearing and the briefs, the District Court\n\f12                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nagain found that HB 2064 by itself did not cure the “re-\nsource” problem; it found that all of the changes, resource-\nrelated and otherwise, including the new teaching and\nadministrative methods, taken together, were not suffi-\ncient to warrant setting aside the judgment or the injunc-\ntive orders; and it denied the Rule 60(b)(5) motion for\nrelief. 480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1164–1167 (Ariz. 2007). The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s conclusions,\nsetting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and\ndetailed opinion. The state superintendent, along with the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we\ngranted the petition.\n                              B\n   Five conclusions follow from the description of the case I\nhave just set forth. First, the Rule 60(b)(5) “changes” upon\nwhich the District Court focused included the “changed\nteaching methods” and the “changed administrative sys-\ntems” that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignor-\ning. Compare ante, at 23–25, 29–31, with Parts III–A, III–\nC, infra. Those changes were, in the petitioners’ view,\nrelated to the “funding” issue, for those changes reduced\nthe need for increased funding. See Motion to Purge, p. 7.\nI concede that the majority of the District Court’s factual\nfindings focused on funding, see ante, at 20. But where is\nthe legal error, given that the opinion clearly shows that\nthe District Court considered, “ ‘focus[ed]’ ” upon, and\nwrote about all the matters petitioners raised? Ibid.; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1160–1161.\n   Second, the District Court and the Court of Appeals\nfocused more heavily upon “incremental funding” costs,\nsee ante, at 15–20, for the reason that the State’s provision\nfor those costs—i.e., its provision of the resources neces-\nsary to run an adequate English-learning program—was\nthe basic contested issue at the 2000 trial and the sole\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nbasis for the District Court’s finding of a statutory viola­\ntion. 172 F. Supp. 2d, at 1226. That is, the sole subsec­\ntion (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the\nState provides the “practices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary” to implement its English-learning program.\nCastaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010. To be sure, as the Court\npoints out, changes other than to the State’s funding\nsystem could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the\nnecessary resources. See, e.g., ante, at 23–25. But given\nthe centrality of “resources” to the case, it is hardly sur­\nprising that the courts below scrutinized the State’s provi­\nsion of “incremental funding,” but without ignoring the\nother related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as\nchanges in teaching methods and administration (all of\nwhich the District Court rejected as insufficient). See Part\nIII, infra.\n   Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court\nand Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statu­\ntory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State’s\nfailure to provide the “practices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary” to eliminate the educational burden that ac­\ncompanies a child’s inability to speak English is precisely\nwhat the statute forbids. See Castaneda, supra, at 1010\n(emphasizing the importance of providing “resources”);\nNixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of provid­\ning “financial support”). And no one in this case suggests\nthere is no need for those resources, e.g., that there are no\nextra costs associated with English-learning education\nirrespective of the teaching method used.            English­\nlearning students, after all, not only require the instruc­\ntion in “academic content areas” like math and science\nthat “typical” students require, but they also need to\nincrease their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writ­\ning English. This language-acquisition instruction re­\nquires particular textbooks and other instructional mate­\nrials, teachers trained in the school’s chosen method for\n\f14                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nteaching English, special assessment tests, and tutoring\nand other individualized instruction—all of which re­\nsources cost money. Brief for Tucson Unified School Dis­\ntrict et al. as Amici Curiae 10–13; Structured English\nImmersion Models of the Arizona English Language Learn­\ners Task Force, http://www.ade.state.az.us/ ELLTaskForce/\n2008/SEIModels05–14–08.pdf (describing Arizona’s re­\nquirement that English-learning students receive four\nhours of language-acquisition instruction per day from\nspecially trained teachers using designated English­\nlearning materials); Imazeki, Assessing the Costs of Ade­\nquacy in California Public Schools, 3 Educ. Fin. & Pol’y 90,\n100 (2008) (estimating that English-learning students\nrequire 74% more resources than typical students). That\nis why the petitioners, opposed as they are to the District\nCourt’s judgment and orders, admitted to the District\nCourt that English learners “need extra help and that\ncosts extra money.” See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161.\n   Fourth, the “resource” issue that the District Court\nfocused upon when it decided the Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nand the statutory subsection (f) issue that lies at the heart\nof the court’s original judgment (and the plaintiffs’ original\ncomplaint) are not different issues, as the Court claims.\nSee ante, at 21–22. Rather in all essential respects they\nare one and the same issue. In focusing upon the one, the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon\nthe other. For all practical purposes, changes that would\nhave proved sufficient to show the statutory violation\ncured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting\naside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.\nAnd in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware\nof the modification/violation relationship. See, e.g., Inter­\nvenor-Defendants’ Closing Argument Memorandum, No.\nCV–92–596–TUC–RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 631, p. 1 (argu­\ning that factual changes had led to “satisf[action]” of the\njudgment).\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   To say, as the Court does, that “[f]unding is merely one\ntool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objec­\ntive,” ante, at 22, while true, is beside the point. Of\ncourse, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But\none way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to\nprovide necessary “practices, resources, and personnel.”\nAnd that is the way the District Court found that the\nState had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be\ntrue of some other case, in this case the failure to provide\nadequate resources and the underlying subsection (f)\nviolation were one and the same thing.\n   Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the\nDistrict Court ordered “increased incremental funding,”\nante, at 19; when it faults the District Court for effectively\n“dictating state or local budget priorities,” ante, at 11;\nwhen it claims that state officials welcomed the result “as\na means of achieving appropriations objectives,” ante, at\n10, n. 3; and when it implies that the District Court’s\norders required the State to provide a “particular level of\nfunding,” ante, at 33. The District Court ordered the State\nto produce a plan that set forth a “reasonable” or “ra­\ntional” relationship between the needs of English-learning\nstudents and the resources provided to them. The orders\nexpressed no view about what kind of English-learning\nprogram the State should use. Nor did the orders say\nanything about the amount of “appropriations” that the\nState must provide, ante, at 10, n. 3, or about any “particu­\nlar funding mechanism,” ante, at 18, that the State was\nobligated to create. Rather, the District Court left it up to\nthe State “to recommend [to the legislature] the level of\nfunding necessary to support the programs that it deter­\nmined to be the most effective.” 160 F. Supp. 2d, at 1044.\nIt ordered no more than that the State (whatever kind of\nprogram it decided to use) must see that the chosen pro­\ngram benefits from a funding system that is not “arbitrary\nand capricious,” but instead “bear[s] a rational relation­\n\f16                   HORNE v.

No. CV–92–596–TUCACM, 2001 WL 1028369,\n*2.\n\n                               II\n   Part I shows that there is nothing suspicious or unusual\nor unlawful about the lower courts having focused primar­\nily upon changes related to the resources Arizona would\ndevote to English-learning education (while also taking\naccount of all the changes the petitioners raised). Thus\nthe Court’s basic criticism of the lower court decisions is\nwithout foundation. I turn next to the Court’s discussion\nof the standards of review the Court finds applicable to\n“institutional reform” litigation.\n   To understand my concern about the Court’s discussion\nof standards, it is important to keep in mind the well­\nknown standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of\nRule 60(b)(5) motions. The Rule by its terms permits\nmodification of a judgment or order (1) when “the judg­\nment has been satisfied,” (2) “released,” or (3) “dis­\ncharged;” when the judgment or order (4) “is based on an\nearlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated;” or (5)\n“applying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equi­\ntable.” No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth\ngrounds are applicable here. The relevant judgment and\norders have not been released or discharged; nor is there\nany relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or\nvacated. Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are\nwhether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or,\nif not, whether their continued application is “equitable.”\nAnd, as I have explained, in context these come down to\nthe same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable\nbecause the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declara­\ntory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and,\ngiven that degree of satisfaction, would it work unneces­\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsary harm to continue the judgment in effect? See supra,\nat 14.\n  To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief, a party must show that “a significant change either\nin factual conditions or in law” renders continued en­\nforcement of the judgment or order “detrimental to the\npublic interest.” Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384. The party can\nclaim that “the statutory or decisional law has changed to\nmake legal what the decree was designed to prevent.” Id.,\nat 388; see also Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S.\n642, 651 (1961). Or the party can claim that relevant facts\nhave changed to the point where continued enforcement of\nthe judgment, order, or decree as written would work, say,\ndisproportionately serious harm. See Rufo, supra, at 384\n(modification may be appropriate when changed circum­\nstances make enforcement “substantially more onerous” or\n“unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles”).\n  The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that Rufo’s “flexible standard” for relief applies.\nThe Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that this “flexible standard” does not itself define\nthe inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must\nmake. To give content to this standard, the Court refers to\nMilliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 282 (1977), in which\nthis Court said that a decree cannot seek to “eliminat[e] a\ncondition that does not violate” federal law or “flow from\nsuch a violation,” ante, at 13, and to Frew v. Hawkins, 540\nU. S. 431, 441 (2004), in which this Court said that a\n“consent decree” must be “limited to reasonable and neces­\nsary implementations of federal law” (emphasis added;\ninternal quotation marks omitted). Ante, at 13. The Court\nadds that in an “institutional reform litigation” case, a\ncourt must also take account of the need not to maintain\ndecrees in effect for too long a time, ante, at 12–13, the\nneed to take account of “sensitive federalism concerns,”\nante, at 11, and the need to take care lest “consent de­\n\f18                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncrees” reflect collusion between private plaintiffs and state\ndefendants at the expense of the legislative process, ante,\nat 12.\n   Taking these cases and considerations together, the\nmajority says the critical question for the lower courts is\n“whether ongoing enforcement of the original order was\nsupported by an ongoing violation of federal law (here\n[subsection (f)]).” Ante, at 18. If not—i.e., if a current\nviolation of federal law cannot be detected—then “ ‘respon­\nsibility for discharging the State’s obligations [must be]\nreturned promptly to the State.’ ” Ante, at 15.\n   One problem with the Court’s discussion of its standards\nis that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely\naccepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and fol­\nlowed them. The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5)\ndecisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions.\nThe lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact\nthat equitable decrees are subject to a “flexible standard”\npermitting modification when circumstances, factual or\nlegal, change significantly.      516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1165 (citing Rufo, supra, at 383). The\nDistrict Court’s application of Castaneda’s interpretation\nof subsection (f), 648 F. 2d, at 1009, along with its efforts\nto provide state officials wide discretionary authority\n(about the level of funding and the kind of funding plan),\nshow considerable sensitivity to “federalism concerns.”\nAnd given the many years (at least seven) of state non­\ncompliance, it is difficult to see how the decree can have\nremained in place too long.\n   Nor is the decree at issue here a “consent decree” as that\nterm is normally understood in the institutional litigation\ncontext. See ante, at 10–13. The State did consent to a\nfew peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the\npresent appeal. App. 19–30. But the State vigorously\ncontested the plaintiffs’ basic original claim, namely, that\nthe State failed to take resource-related “appropriate\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\naction” within the terms of subsection (f). The State pre­\nsented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed\nto show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and\nit opposed entry of the original judgment and every subse­\nquent injunctive order, save the relief sought by petition­\ners here. I can find no evidence, beyond the Court’s specu­\nlation, showing that some state officials have “welcomed”\nthe District Court’s decision “as a means of achieving\nappropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be\nachieved.” Ante, at 10, n. 3. But even were that so, why\nwould such a fact matter here more than in any other case\nin which some state employees believe a litigant who sues\nthe State is right? I concede that the State did not appeal\nthe District Court’s original order or the ensuing injunc­\ntions. But the fact that litigants refrain from appealing\ndoes not turn a litigated judgment into a “consent decree.”\nAt least, I have never before heard that term so used.\n   Regardless, the Court’s discussion of standards raises a\nfar more serious problem. In addition to the standards I\nhave discussed, supra, at 16–17, our precedents recognize\nother, here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles\nthat apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.\nThe Court omits some of them. It mentions but fails to\napply others. As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps\nothers will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a\ncorrect and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion.\n   First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not\nmention—a principle applicable in this case as in others—\nis that, in the absence of special circumstances (e.g., plain\nerror), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the\nparties themselves do not raise. That principle of law is\nlongstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps\ncomes from yet an earlier age. 3 Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 455 (1768) (“[I]t is a practice unknown to\nour law” when examining the decree of an inferior court,\n\f20                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“to examine the justice of the . . . decree by evidence that\nwas never produced below”); Clements v. Macheboeuf, 92\nU. S. 418, 425 (1876) (“Matters not assigned for error will\nnot be examined”); see also Savage v. United States, 92\nU. S. 382, 388 (1876) (where a party with the “burden . . .\nto establish” a “charge . . . fails to introduce any . . . evi­\ndence to support it, the presumption is that the charge is\nwithout any foundation”); McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst. of\nTechnology, 950 F. 2d 13, 22 (CA1 1991) (“It is hornbook\nlaw that theories not raised squarely in the district court\ncannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal” for\n“[o]verburdened trial judges cannot be expected to be mind\nreaders”). As we have recognized, it would be difficult to\noperate an adversary system of justice without applying\nsuch a principle. See Duignan v. United States, 274 U. S.\n195, 200 (1927). But the majority repeatedly considers\nprecisely such claims. See, e.g., ante, at 26–29 (consider­\ning significant matters not raised below); ante, at 34–36\n(same).\n   Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the\nCourt mentions, ante, at 10, is that the party seeking\nrelief from a judgment or order “bears the burden of estab­\nlishing that a significant change in circumstances war­\nrants” that relief. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis\nadded); cf. Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools\nv. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237, 249 (1991) (party moving for\nrelief from judgment must make a “sufficient showing” of\nchange in circumstances). But the Court does not apply\nthat principle. See, e.g., ante, at 30–31, and n. 22 (holding\nthat movants potentially win because of failure of record\nto show that English-learning problems do not stem from\ncauses other than funding); see also ante, at 26–27 (criti­\ncizing lower courts for failing to consider argument not\nmade).\n   Third, the Court ignores the well-established distinction\nbetween a Rule 60(b)(5) request to modify an order and a\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequest to set an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside—a\ndistinction that this Court has previously emphasized. Cf.\nRufo, supra, at 389, n. 12 (emphasizing that “we do not\nhave before us the question whether the entire decree\nshould be vacated”). Courts normally do the latter only if\nthe “party” seeking “to have” the “decree set aside en­\ntirely” shows “that the decree has served its purpose, and\nthere is no longer any need for the injunction.” 12 J.\nMoore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice §60.47 [2][c] (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore). Instead of applying the distinc­\ntion, the majority says that the Court of Appeals “strayed”\nwhen it referred to situations in which changes justified\nsetting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as “ ‘likely\nrare.’ ” Ante, at 14.\n   Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well­\nestablished principle that a party moving under Rule\n60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a “decree set\naside entirely” must show both (1) that the decree’s objects\nhave been “attained,” Frew, 540 U. S., at 442, and (2) that\nit is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlaw­\nful acts it prohibited will again occur. This Court so held\nin Dowell, a case in which state defendants sought relief\nfrom a school desegregation decree on the ground that the\ndistrict was presently operating in compliance with the\nEqual Protection Clause. The Court agreed with the\ndefendants that “a finding by the District Court that the\nOklahoma City School District was being operated in\ncompliance with . . . the Equal Protection Clause” was\nindeed relevant to the question whether relief was appro­\npriate. 498 U. S., at 247. But the Court added that, to\nshow entitlement to relief, the defendants must also show\nthat “it was unlikely that the [school board] would return\nto its former ways.” Ibid. Only then would the “purposes\nof the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.”\nIbid. The principle, as applicable here, simply under­\nscores petitioners’ failure to show that the “changes” to\n\f22                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely\nsetting aside the original court judgment.\n   Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic\nRule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the\nlegal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is\nsought. A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a\nsubstitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal rea­\nsoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to\nshow that the facts, as they were originally, did not then\njustify the order’s issuance. Browder v. Director, Dept. of\nCorrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7 (1978); United\nStates v. Swift & Co., 286 U. S. 106, 119 (1932) (party\ncannot claim that injunction could not lawfully have been\napplied “to the conditions that existed at its making”).\nNor can a party require a court to retrace old legal ground,\nsay, by re-making or rejustifying its original “constitu­\ntional decision every time an effort [is] made to enforce or\nmodify” an order. Rufo, supra, at 389–390 (internal quo­\ntation marks omitted); see also Frew, supra, at 438 (reject­\ning argument that federal court lacks power to enforce an\norder “unless the court first identifies, at the enforcement\nstage, a violation of federal law”).\n   Here, the original judgment rested upon a finding that\nthe State had failed to provide Nogales with adequate\nfunding “resources,” Castaneda, 648 F. 2d, at 1010, in\nviolation of subsection (f)’s “appropriate action” require­\nment. How then can the Court fault the lower courts for\nfirst and foremost seeking to determine whether Arizona\nhad developed a plan that would provide Nogales with\nadequate funding resources? How can it criticize the\nlower courts for having “insulated the policies embedded\nin the order . . . from challenge and amendment,” ante, at\n16, for having failed to appreciate that “funding is simply\na means, not the end” of the statutory requirement, ante,\nat 18, and for having misperceived “the nature of the\nobligation imposed by the” Act, ante, at 23? When the\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)             23\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt criticizes the Court of Appeals for “misperceiving . . .\nthe nature of the obligation imposed” by the Act, ibid.,\nwhen it second-guesses finding after finding of the District\nCourt, see Part III, infra, when it early and often suggests\nthat Arizona may well comply despite lack of a rational\nfunding plan (and without discussing how the changes it\nmentions could show compliance), see ante, at 15, 18, what\nelse is it doing but putting “the plaintiff [or] the court . . .\nto the unnecessary burden of re-establishing what has\nonce been decided”? Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647.\n   Sixth, the Court mentions, but fails to apply, the well­\nsettled legal principle that appellate courts, including this\nCourt, review district court denials of Rule 60(b) motions\n(of the kind before us) for abuse of discretion. See\nBrowder, supra, at 263, n. 7; Railway Employees, supra, at\n648–650. A reviewing court must not substitute its judg­\nment for that of the district court. See National Hockey\nLeague v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U. S. 639,\n642 (1976) (per curiam); see also Calderon v. Thompson,\n523 U. S. 538, 567–568 (1998) (SOUTER, J., dissenting)\n(“[A] high degree of deference to the court exercising dis­\ncretionary authority is the hallmark of [abuse of discre­\ntion] review”). Particularly where, as here, entitlement to\nrelief depends heavily upon fact-related determinations,\nthe power to review the district court’s decision “ought\nseldom to be called into action,” namely only in the rare\ninstance where the Rule 60(b) standard “appears to have\nbeen misapprehended or grossly misapplied.” Cf. Univer­\nsal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U. S. 474, 490–491 (1951).\nThe Court’s bare assertion that a court abuses its discre­\ntion when it fails to order warranted relief, ante, at 10,\nfails to account for the deference due to the District\nCourt’s decision.\n   I have just described Rule 60(b)(5) standards that con­\ncern (1) the obligation (or lack of obligation) upon a court\nto take account of considerations the parties do not raise;\n\f24                     HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(2) burdens of proof; (3) the distinction between setting\naside and modifying a judgment; (4) the need to show that\na decree’s basic objectives have been attained; (5) the\nimportance of not requiring relitigation of previously\nlitigated matters; and (6) abuse of discretion review. Does\nthe Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards\nor to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls\n“institutional reform litigation”?\n   If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in\nthe cases to which it refers, namely Rufo, Milliken, and\nFrew. Rufo involved a motion to modify a complex court­\nmonitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowd­\ning in a local jail. The Court stressed the fact that the\nmodification did not involve setting aside the entire de­\ncree. 502 U. S., at 389, n. 12. It made clear that the party\nseeking relief from an institutional injunction “bears the\nburden of establishing that a significant change in circum­\nstances warrants” that relief. Id., at 383. And it rejected\nthe argument that a reviewing court must determine, in\nevery case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law\nexists. Id., at 389, 390, and n. 12 (refusing to require a\nnew “ ‘constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made\nto enforce or modify’ ” a judgment or decree (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Frew addressed the question whether the Eleventh\nAmendment permits a federal district court to enforce a\nconsent decree against state officials seeking to bring the\nState into compliance with federal law. 540 U. S., at 434–\n435. The Court unanimously held that it does; and in\ndoing so, the Court rejected the State’s alternative argu­\nment that a federal court may only enforce such an order\nif it “first identifies . . . a violation of federal law” existing\nat the time that enforcement is sought. Id., at 438.\nRather, the Court explained that “ ‘federal courts are not\nreduced to’ ” entering judgments or orders “ ‘and hoping for\ncompliance,’ ” id., at 440, but rather retain the power to\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nenforce judgments in order “to ensure that . . . the objects”\nof the court order are met, id., at 442. It also emphasized,\nlike Dowell, that relief is warranted only when “the objects\nof the decree have been attained.” 540 U. S., at 442.\n   What of Milliken? Milliken involved direct review\n(rather than a motion for relief) of a district court’s order\nrequiring the Detroit school system to implement a host of\nremedial programs, including counseling and special\nreading instruction, aimed at schoolchildren previously\nrequired to attend segregated schools. 433 U. S., at 269,\n272. The Court said that a court decree must aim at\n“eliminating a condition” that violates federal law or\nwhich “flow[s] from” such a “violation.” Id., at 282. And it\nunanimously found that the remedy at issue was lawful.\n   These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court\nhas failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I\nhave mentioned. If the Court does not intend any such\nmodifications of these traditional standards, then, as I\nshall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision.\nBut if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in appli­\ncation, it now applies a new set of new rules that are not\nfaithful to our cases and which will create the dangerous\npossibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final\nor acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpet­\nual challenge, offering defendants unjustifiable opportuni­\nties endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the\nburden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.\n   I recognize that the Court’s decision, to a degree, reflects\none side of a scholarly debate about how courts should\nproperly handle decrees in “institutional reform litiga­\ntion.” Compare, in general, R. Sandler & D. Schoenbrod,\nDemocracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run\nGovernment (2003), with, e.g., Chayes, The Role of the\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281,\n1307–1309 (1976). But whatever the merits of that de­\nbate, this case does not involve the kind of “institutional\n\f26                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nlitigation” that most commonly lies at its heart. See, e.g.,\nM. Feeley & E. Rubin, Judicial Policy Making and the\nModern State: How the Courts Reformed America’s Pris­\nons (1998); but see ante, at 10, n. 3.\n   The case does not involve schools, prisons, or mental\nhospitals that have failed to meet basic constitutional\nstandards. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 240–241. It\ndoes not involve a comprehensive judicial decree that\ngoverns the running of a major institution. See, e.g.,\nHutto v. Finney, 437 U. S. 678, 683–684 (1978). It does\nnot involve a highly detailed set of orders. See, e.g.,\nRamos v. Lamm, 639 F. 2d 559, 585–586 (CA10 1980). It\ndoes not involve a special master charged with the task of\nsupervising a complex decree that will gradually bring a\nlarge institution into compliance with the law. See, e.g.,\nRuiz v. Estelle, 679 F. 2d 1115, 1160–1161 (CA5 1982).\nRather, it involves the more common complaint that a\nstate or local government has failed to meet a federal\nstatutory requirement. See, e.g., Concilio de Salud Inte­\ngral de Loiza, Inc. v. Pérez-Perdomo, 551 F. 3d 10, 16 (CA1\n2008); Association of Community Orgs. for Reform Now v.\nEdgar, 56 F. 3d 791, 797–798 (CA7 1995); John B. v.\nMenke, 176 F. Supp. 2d 786, 813–814 (MD Tenn. 2001). It\ninvolves a court imposition of a fine upon the State due to\nits lengthy failure to take steps to comply. See, e.g., Hook\nv. Arizona Dept. of Corrections, 107 F. 3d 1397, 1404 (CA9\n1997); Alberti v. Klevenhagen, 46 F. 3d 1347, 1360 (CA5\n1995). And it involves court orders that leave the State\nfree to pursue the English-learning program of its choice\nwhile insisting only that the State come up with a funding\nplan that is rationally related to the program it chooses.\nThis case is more closely akin to Goldberg v. Kelly, 397\nU. S. 254 (1970) (in effect requiring legislation to fund\nwelfare-related “due process” hearings); cf. id., at 277–279\n(Black, J., dissenting), than it is to the school busing cases\nthat followed Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)          27\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(1954).\n  As I have said, supra, at 16–18, the framework that I\nhave just described, filling in those principles the Court\nneglects, is precisely the framework that the lower courts\napplied. 516 F. 3d, at 1163; 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1165. In\nthe opinions below, I can find no misapplication of the\nlegal standards relevant to this case. To the contrary, the\nCourt of Appeals’ opinion is true to the record and fair to\nthe decision of the District Court. And the majority is\nwrong to conclude otherwise.\n                             III\n   If the Court’s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest\nupon what they did do, namely examine directly whether\nArizona had produced a rational funding program, it must\nrest upon what it believes they did not do, namely ade­\nquately consider the other changes in English-learning\ninstruction, administration, and the like to which petition­\ners referred. Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it\norders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a “proper\nexamination” of “four important factual and legal changes\nthat may warrant the granting of relief from the judg­\nment:” (1) the “adoption of a new . . . instructional meth­\nodology” for teaching English; (2) “Congress’ enactment” of\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, 20 U. S. C. §6842 et\nseq.; (3) “structural and management reforms in Nogales,”\nand (4) “increased overall education funding.” Ante, at 23.\n   The Court cannot accurately hold, however, that the\nlower courts failed to conduct a “proper examination” of\nthese claims, ibid., for the District Court considered three\nof them, in detail and at length, while petitioners no where\nraised the remaining argument, which has sprung full­\ngrown from the Court’s own brow, like Athena from the\nbrow of Zeus.\n\f28                    HORNE v. FLORES \n\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n                              A\n\n   The first “change” that the Court says the lower courts\nmust properly “examin[e]” consists of the “change” of\ninstructional methodology, from a method of “bilingual\neducation” (teaching at least some classes in Spanish,\nwhile providing separate instruction in English) to a\nmethod of “ ‘structured English immersion’ ” (teaching all\nor nearly all classes in English but with a specially de­\nsigned curriculum and materials). Ante, at 23. How can\nthe majority suggest that the lower courts failed properly\nto “examine” this matter?\n   First, more than two days of the District Court’s eight­\nday evidentiary hearing were devoted to precisely this\nmatter, namely the claim pressed below by petitioners\nthat “[t]he adoption of English immersion” constitutes a\n“substantial advancemen[t] in assisting” English learners\n“to become English proficient.” Hearing Memorandum,\nNo. CV–92–596–TUC–RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 588, pp. 4–\n5. The State’s Director of English Acquisition, Irene Mo­\nreno, described the new method as “the most effective”\nway to teach English. Tr. 19 (Jan. 9, 2007). An educa­\ntional consultant, Rosalie Porter, agreed. Id., at 95–96.\nPetitioners’ witnesses also described a new assessment\ntest, the Arizona English Language Learner Assessment,\nid., at 50–51; they described new curricular models that\nwould systematize instructional methods, id., at 78; they\nexplained that all teachers would eventually be required\nto obtain an “endorsement” demonstrating their expertise\nin the chosen instructional method, see Proposed Findings\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law, No. CV–92–596–TUC–\nRCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 593, p. 7; and they pointed to data\nshowing that the percentage of Nogales’ English learners\nsuccessfully completing the program had recently jumped\nfrom 1% of such students in 2004 to 35% in 2006.

Supp. 2d, at 1160. It also indicated that\nit expected the orders would soon prove unnecessary as\nthe State had taken “step[s] towards” developing an “ap­\npropriate” funding mechanism, App. to Pet. for Cert. in\nNo. 08–289, p. 125—a view it later reaffirmed, Order, No.\nCV–92–596–TUC–RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 703, p. 4. The\nCourt of Appeals, too, in its opinion acknowledged that the\ndispute “may finally be nearing resolution.” 516 F. 3d, at\n1180.\n   But, at the same time, the District Court noted that\n“many of the new standards are still evolving.” 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1160. It found that “it would be premature\nto make an assessment of some of these changes.” Ibid.\nAnd it held that, all in all, the changes were not yet suffi­\ncient to warrant relief. Id., at 1167. The Court of Appeals\nupheld the findings and conclusions as within the discre­\ntionary powers of the District Court, adding that the\nevidence showing that significantly more students were\ncompleting the program was “not reliable.” 516 F. 3d, at\n1157. What “further factual findings,” ante, at 25, are\nneeded? As I have explained, the District Court was not\nobligated to relitigate the case. See supra, at 21–22. And\nit did find that “the State has changed its primary model”\nof English-learning instruction “to structured English\nimmersion.” 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. How can the ma­\njority conclude that “further factual findings” are neces­\nsary?\n   Perhaps the majority does not mean to suggest that the\nlower courts failed properly to examine these changes in\nteaching methods. Perhaps it means to express its belief\nthat the lower courts reached the wrong conclusion. After\nall, the Court refers to a “documented, academic support\n\f30                   HORNE v.

Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647–648 (“Where\nthere is . . . a balance of imponderables there must be\nwide discretion in the District Court”). And, despite con­\nsiderable evidence showing improvement, there was also\nconsiderable evidence the other way, evidence that sup­\nported the District Court’s view that it would be “prema­\nture” to set aside the judgment of violation.\n   The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in\nlate 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, “[t]o\none degree or another,” as of June 2005. Tr. 10 (Jan. 12,\n2007); ante, at 25. As of 2006, the State’s newest struc­\ntured English immersion models had not yet taken effect.\nTr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (“We’re getting ready to hopefully\nput down some models for districts to choose from”). The\nState had adopted its new assessment test only the previ­\nous year. App. 164–165. The testimony about the extent\nto which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system\nwas unclear and conflicting. Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9,\n2007) with Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007). And, most importantly,\nthere was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the\nnumber of students completing the English-learning pro­\ngram was considerably overstated. See Tr. 37 (Jan. 18,\n2007) (stating that the assessment test used in 2005 and\n2006, when dramatic improvements had been reported,\nwas significantly less “rigorous” and consequently had\nbeen replaced). The State’s own witnesses were unable\nfirmly to conclude that the new system had so far pro­\nduced significantly improved results.

Given the underlying\nfactual disputes (about, e.g., the reliability of the testing\nmethod), how can this Court now hold that the District\nCourt, and the appellate court that affirmed its conclu­\nsions, were legally wrong?\n                              B\n   The second change that the Court says the lower courts\nshould properly “examine” is the “enactment” of the No\nChild Left Behind Act. Ante, at 25. The Court concedes,\nhowever, that both courts did address the only argument\nabout that “enactment” that the petitioners made, namely,\nthat “compliance” with that new law automatically consti­\ntutes compliance with subsection (f)’s “ ‘appropriate ac­\ntion’ ” requirement. Ante, at 26; see also, e.g., App. 73\n(arguing that the new law “preempts” subsection (f)). And\nthe Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts\nproperly rejected that argument. Ante, at 26.\n   Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts\nwrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which\nthe new Act is “probative,” namely (1) its prompting “sig­\nnificant structural and programming” changes, (2) its\nincreases in “federal funding,” (3) “its assessment and\nreporting requirements,” and (4) its “shift in federal edu­\ncation policy.” Ante, at 26–28. In fact, the lower courts\ndid take account of the changes in structure, program­\nming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to\nthe English-learning program in Nogales and elsewhere in\nthe State. See Part III–A, supra; Parts III–C and III–D,\ninfra. But, I agree with the Court that the District Court\ndid not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor\n\f32                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndid it take account of what the majority calls a “shift in\nfederal education policy.” Ante, at 28.\n  The District Court failed to do what the Court now\ndemands for one simple reason. No one (with the possible\nexception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their\nreply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the\nDistrict Court should take account of any such “change.”\nBut see ante, at 26, and n. 12.\n  As I have explained, see supra, at 19–20, it is well­\nestablished that a district court rarely commits legal error\nwhen it fails to take account of a “change” that no one\ncalled to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that\nno one made. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 249 (party\nseeking relief from judgment must make a “sufficient\nshowing”). A district court must construe fairly the argu­\nments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up\nquestions never squarely presented. That the Court of\nAppeals referred to an argument resembling the Court’s\nnew assertion does not change the underlying legal fact.\nThe District Court committed no legal error in failing to\nconsider it. The Court of Appeals could properly reach the\nsame conclusion. And the Government, referring to the\nargument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on\nthat, or on any other, basis.\n  That is not surprising, since the lower courts have con­\nsistently and explicitly held that “flexibility cannot be\nused to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish\nthat” dissolution is warranted. Thompson v. United States\nDept. of Housing and Urban Development, 220 F. 3d 241,\n248 (CA4 2000); Marshall v. Board of Ed., Bergenfield,\nN. J., 575 F. 2d 417, 423–424 (CA3 1978). There is no\nbasis for treating this case in this respect as somehow\nexceptional, particularly since publicly available docu­\nments indicate that, in any event, Nogales is not “ ‘reach­\ning its own goals under Title III’ ” of the Act.

Again,\nthe Court cannot mean that the lower courts failed to\n“examine” these arguments, for the District Court heard\nextensive evidence on the matter. The Court itself refers\nto some (but only some) of the evidence introduced on this\npoint, namely the testimony of Kelt Cooper, the former\nNogales district superintendent, who said that his admin­\nistrative policies had “ ‘ameliorated or eliminated many of\nthe most glaring inadequacies’ ” in Nogales’ program. Ibid.\nThe Court also refers to the District Court’s and Court of\nAppeals’ conclusions about the matter. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1160 (“The success or failure of the children of” Nogales\n“should not depend on” “one person”); 516 F. 3d, at 1156–\n1157 (recognizing that Nogales had achieved “reforms\nwith limited resources” but also pointing to evidence show­\ning that “there are still significant resource constraints,”\nand affirming the District Court’s similar conclusion).\n   Rather the Court claims that the lower courts improp­\nerly “discounted” this evidence. Ante, at 30. But what\ndoes the Court mean by “discount”? It cannot mean that\nthe lower courts failed to take account of the possibility\nthat these changes “might have brought Nogales[’]” pro­\ngram into “compliance” with subsection (f). After all, that\nis precisely what the petitioners below argued. Interve­\nnor-Defendants’ Closing Argument Memorandum, No.\nCV–92–596–TUC–RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 631, pp. 7–18.\nInstead the Court must mean that the lower courts should\n\f34                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhave given significantly more weight to the changes, i.e.,\nthe Court disagrees with the lower courts’ conclusion\nabout the likely effect these changes will have on the\nsuccess of Nogales’ English-learning programs (hence, on\nthe need for the judgment and orders to remain in effect).\n   It is difficult to understand the legal basis for the\nCourt’s disagreement about this fact-related matter. The\nevidence before the District Court was mixed. It consisted\nof some evidence showing administrative reform and\nmanagerial improvement in Nogales. Ante, at 29–30. At\nthe same time other evidence, to which the Court does not\nrefer, shows that these reforms did not come close to cur­\ning the problem. The record shows, for example, that the\ngraduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students\n(59%) was significantly below the average for all students\n(75%). App. 195. It shows poor performance by English­\nlearning students, compared with English-speaking stu­\ndents, on Arizona’s content-based standardized tests. See\nAppendix A, infra. This was particularly true at Nogales’\nsole high school—which Arizona ranked 575th out of its\n629 schools on an educational department survey, 516\nF. 3d, at 1159—where only 28% of ELL students passed\nthose standardized tests. Ibid.\n   The record also contains testimony from Guillermo\nZamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales’ su­\nperintendent, and who described numerous relevant “re­\nsource-related” deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that\nNogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and “emer­\ngency certified” teachers without necessary training and\nexperience. Tr. 45 (Jan. 18, 2007). Nogales needed addi­\ntional funding to hire trained teachers’ aides—a “strong\ncomponent” of its English-learning program, id., at 47.\nAnd Nogales’ funding needs forced it to pay a starting base\nsalary to its teachers about 14% below the state average,\nmaking it difficult to recruit qualified teachers. Id., at 48.\nFinally, Zamudio said that Nogales’ lack of resources\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           35\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwould likely lead in the near future to the cancellation of\ncertain programs, including a remedial reading program,\nid., at 56, and would prevent the school district from\nproviding appropriate class sizes and tutoring, which he\ncharacterized as “essential and necessary for us to be able\nto have our students learn English,” id., at 75–78.\n   The District Court, faced with all this evidence, found\nthe management and structural “change” insufficient to\nwarrant dissolution of its decree. How can the Court say\nthat this conclusion is unreasonable? What is the legal\nbasis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond\nthe scope of its lawful authority?\n   In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion is unreasonable. Rather it\nenigmatically says that the District Court made “insuffi­\ncient factual findings” to support the conclusion that an\nongoing violation of law exists. Ante, at 31–32. By “insuf­\nficient,” the Court does not mean nonexistent. See 480\nF. Supp. 2d, at 1163–1164. Nor can it mean that the\nDistrict Court’s findings were skimpy or unreasonable.\nThat court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evi­\ndence it acknowledged was mixed. Id., at 1160–1161.\nWhat is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed\nwith appropriate deference?\n   At one point the Court says that there “are many possi­\nble causes” of Nogales’ difficulties and that the lower\ncourts failed to “take into account other variables that\nmay explain” the ongoing deficiencies. Ante, at 32 and\nn. 20. But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to negate the possibility that these other\ncauses, not the State’s resource failures, explain Nogales’\npoor performance. To say this is to ignore well-established\nlaw that accords deference to the District Court’s fact­\nrelated judgments. See supra, at 22–23. The Court’s\nstatements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence\nbelow was mixed. Given that acknowledgment, it is clear\n\f36                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding that petitioners had not shown sufficient “changed\ncircumstances.” And it was petitioners’ job, as the moving\nparty, to show that compliance with federal law has been\nachieved. Where “other variables” make it difficult to\nconclude that a present violation does or does not exist,\nwhat error does the District Court commit if it concludes\nthat the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?\n                               D\n  The fourth “change” that the Court suggests the lower\ncourts did not properly “examine” consists of an “overall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.”\nAnte, at 32. Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the\nDistrict Court failed fully to examine the matter, for de­\nspite the Court’s assertions to the contrary, it made a\nnumber of “up-to-date factual findings,” ante, at 33, on the\nmatter, see 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161–1164. Those findings\nreflect that the State had developed an educational plan\nthat raised the “base level amount” for the typical student\nfrom $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in con­\nstant 2006 dollars), ante, at 32, n. 21; and that plan in­\ncreased the additional (i.e., “weighted”) amount that would\nbe available per English-learning student from $182 to\n$349 (in 2006 dollars). The State contended that this new\nplan, with its explanation of how the money needed would\nbe forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources,\nmet subsection (f)’s requirement for “appropriate action”\n(as related to “resources”) and the District Court’s own\ninsistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those\nresources. See Appendix B, infra.\n  Once again the Court’s “factual-finding” criticism seems,\nin context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower\ncourts’ resolution of this argument. That is to say, the\nCourt seems to disagree with the District Court’s conclu­\nsion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           37\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nshow that adequate resources for English-learning pro­\ngrams would likely be forthcoming; hence the new plan\nwas not “rationally related” to the underlying resource\nproblem.\n   The record, however, adequately supports the District\nCourt’s conclusion. For one thing, the funding plan dem­\nonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was\ntargeted at “base level” education, see Appendix B, infra,\ni.e., it was funding available to provide students with basic\neducational services like instruction in mathematics,\nscience, and so forth. See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007). The\nDistrict Court found that this funding likely would not\nbecome available for English-learning programs.\n   How is that conclusion unreasonable? If these funds are\nprovided for the provision of only basic services, how can\nthe majority now decide that a school district—\nparticularly a poor school district like Nogales—would be\nable to cover the additional expenses associated with\nEnglish-learning education while simultaneously manag­\ning to provide for its students’ basic educational needs?\nIndeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied\nto a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of\nstudents who need extra resources. See 516 F. 3d, at 1145\n(approximately 90% of Nogales’ students were, or had\nbeen, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006).\nWhere the vast majority of students in a district are those\nwho “need extra help” which “costs extra money,” it is\ndifficult to imagine where one could find an untapped\nstream of funding that could cover those additional costs.\n   For another thing, the petitioners’ witnesses conceded\nthat the State had not yet determined the likely costs to\nschool districts of teaching English learners using the\nstructured English immersion method. See, e.g., Tr. 199–\n200 (Jan. 17, 2007). The legislators reported that the\nState had recently asked a task force to “determine” the\nextra costs associated with implementing the structured\n\f38                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nEnglish immersion model. Speaker’s Opening Appellate\nBrief in No. 07–15603 etc. (CA9), p. 31. But that task\nforce had not yet concluded its work.\n  Further, the District Court doubted that the federal\nportion of the funding identified by the petitioners would\nbe available for English-learning programs. It character­\nized certain federal grant money, included in the petition­\ners’ calculus of available funds, as providing only “short­\nterm” assistance, 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1161. And testimony\nat the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the\nfunds identified by petitioners might not in fact be avail­\nable to Nogales’ schools. See Tr. 59–61 (Jan. 10, 2007). It\nalso noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning\nthat no particular English-learning child could benefit\nfrom them for more than two years—despite the fact that\nEnglish-learning students in Nogales on average spend\nfour to five years in that program. 480 F. Supp. 2d, at\n1163–1164 (Nogales will have to “dilute” the funds pro­\nvided to cover students who remain English learners for\nmore than two years).\n  Finally, the court pointed to federal law, which imposes\na restriction forbidding the State to use a large portion of\n(what the State’s plan considered to be) available funds in\nthe manner the State proposed, i.e., to “supplant,” or\nsubstitute for, the funds the State would otherwise have\nspent on the program. Id., at 1162; see also 20 U. S. C.\n§§6314(a)(2)(B), 6315(b)(3), 6613(f), 6825(g). The District\nCourt concluded that the State’s funding plan was in large\npart unworkable in light of this restriction. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the\ntestimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States De­\npartment of Education employee and an “expert” on this\ntype of federal funding. Fagan testified that Arizona’s\nplan was a “ ‘blatant violation’ ” of the relevant laws, which\ncould result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in\nfederal funds—including those federal funds the State’s\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

Supp. 2d,\nat 1163.\n   The Court says that the analysis I have just described,\nand in which the court engaged, amounts to “clear legal\nerror.” Ante, at 33. What error? Where is the error? The\nCourt does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts\n“should not” have “disregarded” the relevant federal (i.e.,\nNo Child Left Behind Act) funds “just because they are not\nstate funds.” Ante, at 27. But the District Court did not\ndisregard those funds “just because they are not state\nfunds.” Nor did it “foreclos[e] the possibility that petition­\ners could” show entitlement to relief by pointing to “an\noverall increase in education funding.” Ante, at 33.\nRather, the District Court treated those increased funds\nas potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as\nplanned would violate federal law and would thereby\nthreaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal\nfunding it planned to use. It concluded that the State’s\nplan amounted to “ ‘a blatant violation’ ” of federal law, and\nremarked that “the potential loss of federal funds is sub­\nstantial.” 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1163. Is there a better\nreason for “disregard[ing]” those funds?\n   The Court may have other “errors” in mind as well. It\ndoes say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that\n“increased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,” ante, at 28 (emphasis added), and it refers\nto nine studies that suggest that increased funding does\nnot always help. See ante, at 28–31, nn. 17–19; see also\nBrief for Education-Policy Scholars as Amici Curiae 7–11\n(discussing such scholarship). I do not know what this has\nto do with the matter. But if it is relevant to today’s deci­\nsion, the Court should also refer to the many studies that\ncast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites. See,\ne.g., H. Ladd & J. Hansen, Making Money Matter: Financ­\ning America’s Schools 140–147 (1999); Hess, Understand­\ning Achievement (and Other) Changes Under Chicago\n\f40                     HORNE v.

Laine, The Effect of\nSchool Resources on Student Achievement, 66 Rev. Educ.\nRes. 361, 362 (1996).\n  Regardless, the relation of a funding plan to improved\nperformance is not an issue for this Court to decide\nthrough footnote references to the writings of one side of a\ncomplex expert debate. The question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to\na “change” that satisfies subsection (f)’s requirement. The\nDistrict Court found it did not. Nothing this Court says\ncasts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.\n                                IV\n   The Court’s remaining criticisms are not well founded.\nThe Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for\nhaving referred to the “circumstances” that “warrant Rule\n60(b)(5) relief as ‘likely rare,’ ” for having said the petition­\ners would have to “sweep away” the District Court’s “fund­\ning determination” in order to prevail, for having spoken\nof the “landscape” as not being “so radically changed as to\njustify relief from judgment without compliance,” and for\nhaving somewhat diminished the “close[ness]” of its re­\nview for “federalism concerns” because the State and its\nBoard of Education “wish the injunction to remain in\nplace.” Ante, at 14–15 (first, second, and fourth emphases\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court, however, does not explain the context in\nwhich the Court of Appeals’ statements appeared. That\ncourt used its first phrase (“likely rare”) to refer to the\nparticular kind of modification that the State sought,\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)            41\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nnamely complete relief from the original judgment, even if\nthe judgment’s objective was not yet fully achieved. 516\nF. 3d, at 1167; cf. Moore §60.47 [2][c]. As far as I know it\nis indeed “rare” that “a prior judgment is so undermined\nby later circumstances as to render its continued enforce­\nment inequitable” even though compliance with the judg­\nment’s legal determination has not occurred. 516 F. 3d, at\n1167. At least, the Court does not point to other instances\nthat make it common. Uses of the word “sweeping” and\n“radica[l] change” in context refer to the deference owed to\nthe District Court’s 2000 legal determination. See id., at\n1168 (describing the 2000 order’s “basic determination”\nthat English-learning “programs require substantial state\nfunding in addition to that spent on basic educational\nprogramming”). If there is an error (which I doubt, see\nsupra, at 21–23) the error is one of tone, not of law.\n   Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a\ndifference when the Court of Appeals said it should down­\nplay the importance of federalism concerns because some\nelements of Arizona’s state government support the judg­\nment. I do not know the legal basis for the majority’s\nreference to this recalibration of judicial distance as “flatly\nincorrect,” but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recali­\nbrating the recalibration could matter.\n   In sum, the majority’s decision to set aside the lower\ncourt decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a\nwedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b)\nreview of changes that would bring the State into compli­\nance with federal law, Part I, supra; (2) a misguided at­\ntempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong\nlegal standards, Part II, supra; (3) a mistaken belief that\nthe lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part\nIII, supra; and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV,\nsupra and this page. By tracing each of these criticisms to\nits source in the record, I have tried to show that each is\nunjustified. Whether taken separately or together, they\n\f42                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ncannot warrant setting aside the Court of Appeals’\ndecision.\n                             V\n   As a totally separate matter, the Court says it is “un­\nclear” whether the District Court improperly ordered\nstatewide injunctive relief instead of confining that relief\nto Nogales. And it orders the District Court to vacate the\ninjunction “insofar as it extends beyond Nogales” unless\nthe court finds that “Arizona is violating” subsection (f)\n“on a statewide basis.” Ante, at 36.\n   What is the legal support for this part of the majority’s\nopinion? Prior to the appearance of this case in this Court,\nno one asked for that modification. Nothing in the law, as\nfar as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous.\nIndeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the\ninjunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the\ndefendant in the litigation, asked the Court to enter that\nrelief. The State pointed in support to a state constitu­\ntional provision requiring educational uniformity. See\nante, at 35. There is no indication that anyone disputed\nwhether the injunction should have statewide scope. A\nstatewide program harmed Nogales’ students, App. 13–14,\n¶¶40, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief. What in\nthe law makes this relief erroneous?\n   The majority says that the District Court must consider\nthis matter because “[p]etitioners made it clear at oral\nargument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.”\nAnte, at 34, n. 23. I find the matter less clear. I would\ndirect the reader to the oral argument transcript, which\nreads in part:\n     “Mr. Starr: What was entered here in this order,\n     which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire\n     State funding mechanism has been interfered with by\n     the order.

I think it\n    was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied\n    only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State at­\n    torney general wanted that done.\n    “Mr. Starr: But we should be able now to—\n    “JUSTICE SCALIA: But that’s—that’s water over the\n    dam. That’s not what this suit is about now.” Tr. of\n    Oral Arg. 26.\nRegardless, what is the legal basis for the Court’s order\ntelling the District Court it must reconsider the matter?\nThere is no clear error. No one has asked the District\nCourt for modification. And the scope of relief is primarily\na question for the District Court. Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 15 (1971) (“Once a\nright and a violation have been shown, the scope of a\ndistrict court’s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\nbroad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in equitable\nremedies”).\n                             VI\n  As the length of the opinions indicates, this case re­\nquires us to read a highly detailed record. Members of\nthis Court have reached different conclusions about what\nthat record says. But there is more to the case than that.\n  First, even if one sees this case as simply a technical\nrecord-reading case, the disagreement among us shows\nwhy this Court should ordinarily hesitate to hear cases\nthat require us to do no more than to review a lengthy\nrecord simply to determine whether a lower court’s fact­\nbased determinations are correct. Cf. Universal Camera,\n340 U. S., at 488 (“[A] court may [not] displace” a “choice\nbetween two fairly conflicting views, even though the court\nwould justifiably have made a different choice had the\nmatter been before it de novo”); Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v.\nLinde Air Products Co., 336 U. S. 271, 275 (1949) (noting\nthe well-settled rule that this court will not “undertake to\nreview concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in\n\f44                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthe absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of\nerror”). In such cases, appellate courts are closer to the\nfray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the\nrecord, and are more likely to treat trial court determina­\ntions fairly and with respect—as is clearly so here.\n   Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical\nrecord-based aspects of this case and applies a new review\nframework, it risks problems in future cases. The frame­\nwork it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support\nor explanation. And it will be difficult for lower courts to\nunderstand and to apply that framework, particularly if it\nrests on a distinction between “institutional reform litiga­\ntion” and other forms of litigation. Does the Court mean\nto say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go\nbeyond a party’s own demands and relitigate an underly­\ning legal violation whenever that party asks for modifica­\ntion of an injunction? How could such a rule work in\npractice? See supra, at 21–23. Does the Court mean to\nsuggest that there are other special, strict pro-defendant\nrules that govern review of district court decisions in\n“institutional reform cases”? What precisely are those\nrules? And when is a case an “institutional reform” case?\nAfter all, as I have tried to show, see supra, at 18–19, the\ncase before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court’s\nProcrustean “institutional reform” bed.\n   Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an\nattitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforce­\nment of federal statutes will impose significant financial\nburdens upon States. An attitude, however, is not a rule\nof law. Nor does any such attitude point towards vacating\nthe Court of Appeals’ opinion here. The record makes\nclear that the District Court did take care. See supra, at\n15. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care,\nproducing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record\nand fair to the lower court and to the parties’ submissions\nas well. I do not see how this Court can now require lower\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The case\nconcerns the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attend­\ning public school near the Mexican border, to learn Eng­\nlish in order to live their lives in a country where English\nis the predominant language. In a Nation where nearly 47\nmillion people (18% of the population) speak a language\nother than English at home, U. S. Dept. of Commerce,\nEconomics and Statistics Admin., Census Bureau, Census\n2000 Brief: Language Use and English-Speaking Ability 2\n(Oct. 2003), it is important to ensure that those children,\nwithout losing the cultural heritage embodied in the lan­\nguage of their birth, nonetheless receive the English­\nlanguage tools they need to participate in a society where\nthat second language “serves as the fundamental medium\nof social interaction” and democratic participation.\nRodríguez, Language and Participation, 94 Cal. L. Rev.\n687, 693 (2006). In that way linguistic diversity can com­\nplement and support, rather than undermine, our democ­\nratic institutions. Id., at 688.\n   At least, that is what Congress decided when it set\nfederal standards that state officials must meet. In doing\nso, without denying the importance of the role of state and\nlocal officials, it also created a role for federal judges,\nincluding judges who must see that the States comply\nwith those federal standards. Unfortunately, for reasons I\nhave set forth, see Part II, supra, the Court’s opinion will\nmake it more difficult for federal courts to enforce those\nfederal standards. Three decades ago, Congress put this\nstatutory provision in place to ensure that our Nation’s\nschool systems will help non-English-speaking schoolchil­\ndren overcome the language barriers that might hinder\ntheir participation in our country’s schools, workplaces,\n\f46                   HORNE v.

Argued April 20, 2009—Decided June 25, 2009*\nA group of English Language-Learner (ELL) students and their parents\n   (plaintiffs) filed a class action, alleging that Arizona, its State Board\n   of Education, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction (defen\n   dants) were providing inadequate ELL instruction in the Nogales\n   Unified School District (Nogales), in violation of the Equal Educa\n   tional Opportunities Act of 1974 (EEOA), which requires States to\n   take “appropriate action to overcome language barriers” in schools,\n   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1703(f). In 2000, the Federal District Court entered a\n   declaratory judgment, finding an EEOA violation in Nogales because\n   the amount of funding the State allocated for the special needs of\n   ELL students (ELL incremental funding) was arbitrary and not re\n   lated to the actual costs of ELL instruction in Nogales. The District\n   Court subsequently extended relief statewide and, in the years fol\n   lowing, entered a series of additional orders and injunctions. The de\n   fendants did not appeal any of the District Court’s orders. In 2006,\n   the state legislature passed HB 2064, which, among other things, in\n   creased ELL incremental funding. The incremental funding increase\n   required District Court approval, and the Governor asked the state\n   attorney general to move for accelerated consideration of the bill.\n   The State Board of Education, which joined the Governor in opposing\n   HB 2064, the State, and the plaintiffs are respondents here.

In the alternative, they sought relief under Federal\n    Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5). The District Court denied their mo\n    tion to purge the contempt order and declined to address the Rule\n    60(b)(5) claim. The Court of Appeals vacated and remanded for an\n    evidentiary hearing on whether changed circumstances warranted\n    Rule 60(b)(5). On remand, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b)(5)\n    motion, holding that HB 2064 had not created an adequate funding\n    system. Affirming, the Court of Appeals concluded that Nogales had\n    not made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant re\n    lief.\nHeld:\n    1. The superintendent has standing.

In\n junctions of this sort may also raise sensitive federalism concerns,\n which are heightened when, as in these cases, a federal-court decree\n has the effect of dictating state or local budget priorities. Finally, in\n stitutional reform injunctions bind state and local officials to their\n predecessors’ policy preferences and may thereby “improperly deprive\n future officials of their designated legislative and executive powers.”\n Frew v.

Thus, a critical question in this Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry\nis whether the EEOA violation underlying the 2000 order has been\nremedied. If it has, the order’s continued enforcement is unnecessary\nand improper. Pp. 10–14.\n     (b) The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5)\nanalysis just described. Pp. 14–23.\n        (i) Its Rule 60(b)(5) standard was too strict. The Court of Ap\npeals explained that situations in which changed circumstances war\nrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief are “likely rare,” and that, to succeed, peti\ntioners had to show that conditions in Nogales had so changed as to\n“sweep away” the District Court’s incremental funding determina\ntion. The Court of Appeals also incorrectly reasoned that federalism\nconcerns were substantially lessened here because the State and the\nState Board of Education wanted the injunction to remain in place.\nPp. 14–15.\n        (ii) The Court of Appeals’ inquiry was also too narrow, focusing\nalmost exclusively on the sufficiency of ELL incremental funding. It\nattributed undue significance to petitioners’ failure to appeal the Dis\ntrict Court’s 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexi\nble changed circumstances inquiry prescribed by Rufo. The Court of\nAppeals’ inquiry was, effectively, an inquiry into whether the 2000\norder had been satisfied. But satisfaction of an earlier judgment is\nonly one of Rule 60(b)(5)’s enumerated bases for relief. Petitioners\ncould obtain relief on the independent basis that prospective en\nforcement of the order was “no longer equitable.” To determine the\nmerits of this claim, the Court of Appeals should have ascertained\nwhether the 2000 order’s ongoing enforcement was supported by an\nongoing EEOA violation. Although the EEOA requires a State to\ntake “appropriate action,” it entrusts state and local authorities with\nchoosing how to meet this obligation. By focusing solely on ELL in\ncremental funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended this man\ndate. And by requiring petitioners to demonstrate “appropriate ac\ntion” through a particular funding mechanism, it improperly\nsubstituted its own policy judgments for those of the state and local\nofficials entrusted with the decisions. Pp. 15–18.\n     (c) The District Court’s opinion reveals similar errors. Rather\nthan determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief\nfrom the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied\nthat order through increased ELL incremental funding. Pp. 18–20.\n     (d) Because the Court of Appeals and the District Court misper\nceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the\nRule 60(b)(5) inquiry, this case must be remanded for a proper ex\namination of at least four factual and legal changes that may war\n\f4                          HORNE v.

Pp. 23–34.\n           (i) After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a “bi\n    lingual education” methodology of ELL instruction to “structured\n    English immersion” (SEI). Research on ELL instruction and findings\n    by the State Department of Education support the view that SEI is\n    significantly more effective than bilingual education. A proper Rule\n    60(b)(5) analysis should entail further factual findings regarding\n    whether Nogales’ implementation of SEI is a “changed circumstance”\n    warranting relief. Pp. 23–25.\n           (ii) Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001\n    (NCLB), which represents another potentially significant “changed\n    circumstance.” Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily\n    constitute “appropriate action” under the EEOA, NCLB is relevant to\n    petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted\n    the State to make significant structural and programming changes in\n    its ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for\n    education in general and ELL programming in particular; it provided\n    evidence of the progress and achievement of Nogales’ ELL students\n    through its assessment and reporting requirements; and it marked a\n    shift in federal education policy. Pp. 25–29.\n           (iii) Nogales’ superintendent instituted significant structural\n    and management reforms which, among other things, reduced class\n    sizes, improved student/teacher ratios, and improved the quality of\n    teachers. Entrenched in the incremental funding framework, the\n    lower courts failed to recognize that these changes may have brought\n    Nogales’ ELL programming into compliance with the EEOA even\n    without sufficient incremental funding to satisfy the 2000 order.\n    This was error. Because the EEOA focuses on the quality of educa\n    tional programming and services to students, not the amount of\n    money spent, there is no statutory basis for precluding petitioners\n    from showing that Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant ELL pro\n    gramming in ways other than through increased incremental fund\n    ing. A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry should recognize this and should\n    ask whether, as a result of structural and managerial improvements,\n    Nogales is now providing equal educational opportunities to ELL\n    students. Pp. 29–32.\n           (iv) There was an overall increase in education funding avail\n    able in Nogales. The Court of Appeals foreclosed the possibility that\n    petitioners could show that this overall increase was sufficient to\n    support EEOA-compliant ELL programming. This was clear legal\n    error. The EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement does not neces\n    sarily require a particular level of funding, and to the extent that\n    funding is relevant, the EEOA does not require that the money come\n    from a particular source. Thus, the District Court should evaluate\n\f                      Cite as: 557 U.

Pp. 32–34.\n    3. On remand, if petitioners press their objection to the injunction\n  as it extends beyond Nogales, the lower courts should consider\n  whether the District Court erred in entering statewide relief. The re\n  cord contains no factual findings or evidence that any school district\n  other than Nogales failed to provide equal educational opportunities\n  to ELL students, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA\n  can justify a statewide injunction here. The state attorney general’s\n  concern that a “Nogales only” remedy would run afoul of the Arizona\n  Constitution’s equal-funding requirement did not provide a valid ba\n  sis for a statewide federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question\n  to be determined by state authorities. Unless the District Court con\n  cludes that Arizona is violating the EEOA statewide, it should vacate\n  the injunction insofar as it extends beyond Nogales.

The question at issue in\nthese cases is not whether Arizona must take “appropriate\naction” to overcome the language barriers that impede\nELL students. Of course it must. But petitioners argue\nthat Arizona is now fulfilling its statutory obligation by\nnew means that reflect new policy insights and other\nchanged circumstances.

In June\n2001, the state attorney general acquiesced in the state\nwide extension of the declaratory judgment order, a step\nthat the State has explained by reference to the Arizona\nconstitutional requirement of uniform statewide school\nfunding.

In support of their\nmotion, they stated that although the attorney general\nhad a “legal duty” to defend HB 2064, the attorney general\nhad shown “little enthusiasm” for advancing the legisla\nture’s interests.

The Dis\ntrict Court granted the Legislators’ motion for permissive\nintervention, and the Legislators and superintendent\n(together, petitioners here) moved to purge the District\nCourt’s contempt order in light of HB 2064. Alternatively,\nthey moved for relief under Federal Rule of Civil Proce\ndure 60(b)(5) based on changed circumstances.\n   In April 2006, the District Court denied petitioners’\nmotion, concluding that HB 2064 was fatally flawed in\nthree respects.

Second, the court concluded\nthat imposing a 2-year limit on funding for each ELL\nstudent was irrational.

For nearly a decade, the orders of a federal\ndistrict court have substantially restricted the ability of the State of\nArizona to make basic decisions regarding educational policy, appro\npriations, and budget priorities.

For one thing, injunctions issued in\nsuch cases often remain in force for many years, and the\npassage of time frequently brings about changed circum\nstances—changes in the nature of the underlying problem,\nchanges in governing law or its interpretation by the\ncourts, and new policy insights—that warrant reexamina\ntion of the original judgment.\n   Second, institutional reform injunctions often raise\nsensitive federalism concerns. Such litigation commonly\ninvolves areas of core state responsibility, such as public\neducation. See Missouri v.

When a federal court orders\nthat money be appropriated for one program, the effect is\noften to take funds away from other important programs.\nSee Jenkins, supra, at 131 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (“A\nstructural reform decree eviscerates a State’s discretion\nary authority over its own program and budgets and forces\nstate officials to reallocate state resources and funds”).\n   Finally, the dynamics of institutional reform litigation\ndiffer from those of other cases.

Rather than applying a flexible\nstandard that seeks to return control to state and local\nofficials as soon as a violation of federal law has been\nremedied, the Court of Appeals used a heightened stan\ndard that paid insufficient attention to federalism con\ncerns. And rather than inquiring broadly into whether\nchanged conditions in Nogales provided evidence of an\nELL program that complied with the EEOA, the Court of\nAppeals concerned itself only with determining whether\nincreased ELL funding complied with the original declara\ntory judgment order. The court erred on both counts.\n                                1\n   The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion\nby citing the correct legal standard, see </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1163\n(noting that relief is appropriate upon a showing of “ ‘a\nsignificant change either in factual conditions or in law’ ”),\nbut it quickly strayed.

This statement is flatly incorrect, as\neven respondents acknowledge. Brief for Respondent\nState of Arizona et al. 20–21. Precisely because different\nstate actors have taken contrary positions in this litiga\ntion, federalism concerns are elevated. And precisely\nbecause federalism concerns are heightened, a flexible\napproach to Rule 60(b)(5) relief is critical. “[W]hen the\nobjects of the decree have been attained”—namely, when\nEEOA compliance has been achieved—“responsibility for\ndischarging the State’s obligations [must be] returned\npromptly to the State and its officials.” Frew, 540 U.

In\nlarge part, this was driven by the significance the Court of\nAppeals attributed to petitioners’ failure to appeal the\nDistrict Court’s original order. The Court of Appeals\nexplained that “the central idea” of that order was that\nwithout sufficient ELL incremental funds, “ELL programs\nwould necessarily be inadequate.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1167–\n—————— \n\nby characterizing our discussion as reading them out of context.

It re\npeated this refrain throughout its opinion, emphasizing\nthat the “interest in finality must be given great weight,”\nid., at 1163, and explaining that petitioners could not now\nask for relief “on grounds that could have been raised on\nappeal from the Declaratory Judgment and from earlier\ninjunctive orders but were not,” id., at 1167. “If [petition\ners] believed that the district court erred and should have\nlooked at all funding sources differently in its EEOA\ninquiry,” the court wrote, “they should have appealed the\nDeclaratory Judgment.” Id., at 1171.\n   In attributing such significance to the defendants’ fail\nure to appeal the District Court’s original order, the Court\nof Appeals turned the risks of institutional reform litiga\ntion into reality. By confining the scope of its analysis to\nthat of the original order, it insulated the policies embed\nded in the order—specifically, its incremental funding\nrequirement—from challenge and amendment.5 But those\npolicies were supported by the very officials who could\nhave appealed them—the state defendants—and, as a\nresult, were never subject to true challenge.\n   Instead of focusing on the failure to appeal, the Court of\nAppeals should have conducted the type of Rule 60(b)(5)\ninquiry prescribed in Rufo.

It allows a court to recognize that the longer an\ninjunction or consent decree stays in place, the greater the\nrisk that it will improperly interfere with a State’s democ\nratic processes.\n   The Court of Appeals purported to engage in a “changed\ncircumstances” inquiry, but it asked only whether changed\ncircumstances affected ELL funding and, more specifi\ncally, ELL incremental funding. Relief was appropriate,\nin the court’s view, only if petitioners “demonstrate[d]\neither that there [we]re no longer incremental costs asso\nciated with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona’s\n‘base plus incremental costs’ educational funding model\nwas so altered that focusing on ELL-specific incremental\ncosts funding has become irrelevant and inequitable.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1169.\n   This was a Rule 60(b)(5) “changed circumstances” in\nquiry in name only. In reality, it was an inquiry into\nwhether the deficiency in ELL incremental funding that\nthe District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.\nAnd this, effectively, was an inquiry into whether the\noriginal order had been satisfied. Satisfaction of an earlier\njudgment is one of the enumerated bases for Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief—but it is not the only basis for such relief.\n   Rule 60(b)(5) permits relief from a judgment where “[i]\nthe judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged;\n[ii] it is based on an earlier judgment that has been re\nversed or vacated; or [iii] applying it prospectively is no\nlonger equitable.” (Emphasis added.) Use of the disjunc\ntive “or” makes it clear that each of the provision’s three\ngrounds for relief is independently sufficient and therefore\nthat relief may be warranted even if petitioners have not\n“satisfied” the original order.

See Milliken, 433 U. S.,\nat 282. It failed to do so.\n   As previously noted, the EEOA, while requiring a State\nto take “appropriate action to overcome language barri\ners,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §1703(f), “leave[s] state and local educa\ntional authorities a substantial amount of latitude in\nchoosing” how this obligation is met.

Of course, any educational program, in\ncluding the “appropriate action” mandated by the EEOA,\nrequires funding, but funding is simply a means, not the\nend. By focusing so intensively on Arizona’s incremental\nELL funding, the Court of Appeals misapprehended the\nEEOA’s mandate. And by requiring petitioners to demon\nstrate “appropriate action” through a particular funding\nmechanism, the Court of Appeals improperly substituted\nits own educational and budgetary policy judgments for\nthose of the state and local officials to whom such deci\nsions are properly entrusted.

It disregarded the re\nmand instructions to engage in a broad and flexible Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circumstances\nwarranted relief. In taking this approach, the District\nCourt abused its discretion.\n                              D\n   The dissent defends the narrow approach of the lower\ncourts with four principal conclusions that it draws from\nthe record. All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect\nand mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts—a\nfixation on the issue of incremental funding and a failure\nto recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry.\n   First, the dissent concludes that “the Rule 60(b)(5)\n‘changes’ upon which the District Court focused” were not\nlimited to changes in funding, and included “ ‘changed\nteaching methods’ ” and “ ‘changed administrative sys\ntems.’ ” Post, at 12. The District Court did note a range of\nchanged circumstances, concluding that as a result of\nthese changes, Nogales was “doing substantially better.”\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

To the\ncontrary, the District Court explained that “it would be\npremature to make an assessment of some of these\nchanges.” Ibid. Accordingly, of the 28 findings of fact that\nthe court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed fund\ning directly and exclusively. See id., at 1161–1163. The\nlast eight addressed funding indirectly—discussing reclas\nsification rates because of their relevance to HB 2064’s\nfunding restrictions for ELL and reclassified students.\nSee id., at 1163–1165. None of the District Court’s find\nings of fact addressed either “ ‘changed teaching methods’ ”\nor “ ‘changed administrative systems.’ ”\n   The dissent’s second conclusion is that “ ‘incremental\nfunding’ costs . . . [were] the basic contested issue at the\n\f                     Cite as: 557 U.

We fail to see\nthis conclusion’s relevance to this Rule 60(b)(5) motion,\nwhere the question is whether any change in factual or\nlegal circumstances renders continued enforcement of the\noriginal order inequitable. As the dissent itself acknowl\nedges, petitioners “pointed to three sets of changed cir\ncumstances [in their Rule 60(b)(5) motion] which, in their\nview, showed that the judgment and the related orders\nwere no longer necessary.” Post, at 11. In addition to\n“increases in the amount of funding available to Arizona\nschool districts,” these included “changes in the method of\nEnglish-learning instruction,” and “changes in the admini\nstration of the Nogales school district.” Ibid.\n  Third, the dissent concludes that “the type of issue upon\nwhich the District Court and Court of Appeals focused”—\nthe incremental funding issue—“lies at the heart of the\nstatutory demand for equal educational opportunity.”\nPost, at 13. In what we interpret to be a restatement of\nthis point, the dissent also concludes that sufficient fund\ning (“the ‘resource’ issue”) and the presence or absence of\nan EEOA violation (“the statutory subsection (f) issue”) “are\none and the same.” Post, at 14 (emphasis in original). “In\nfocusing upon the one,” the dissent asserts, “the District\nCourt and Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other.”\nIbid.\n  Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, these two issues are\ndecidedly not “one and the same.”7 Ibid.

The proper inquiry is not limited to the issue of funding.\nRather, it encompasses the question whether the State has shown any\nfactual or legal changes that establish compliance with the EEOA.\n\f22                        HORNE v.

Funding is merely one tool that may be em\nployed to achieve the statutory objective.\n  Fourth, the dissent concludes that the District Court did\nnot order increased ELL incremental funding and did not\ndictate state and local budget priorities. Post, at 15. The\ndissent’s point—and it is a very small one—is that the\nDistrict Court did not set a specific amount that the legis\nlature was required to appropriate. The District Court\ndid, however, hold the State in contempt and impose\nheavy fines because the legislature did not provide suffi\ncient funding. These orders unquestionably imposed\nimportant restrictions on the legislature’s ability to set\nbudget priorities.\n——————\n   8 The dissent cites two sources for this proposition.        The first—\nCastaneda v. Pickard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"390327\"><a href=\"/opinion/390327/elizabeth-and-katherine-castaneda-by-their-father-and-next-friend-roy-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (CA5 1981)—sets out a three-part\ntest for “appropriate action.” Under that test, a State must (1) formu\nlate a sound English language instruction educational plan, (2) imple\nment that plan, and (3) achieve adequate results. See id., at 1009–\n1010. Whether or not this test provides much concrete guidance\nregarding the meaning of “appropriate action,” the test does not focus\non incremental funding or on the provision of resources more generally.\n   The second source cited by the dissent—curiously—is a speech given\nby President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on\nlegislation imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the\nEqual Educational Opportunities Act of 1972. See post, at 13 (citing\nAddress to the Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8\nWeekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 590, 591 (1972)). In the speech, President\nNixon said that schools in poor neighborhoods should receive the\n“financial support . . . that we know can make all the difference.” Id.,\nat 593. It is likely that this statement had nothing to do with the\ninterpretation of EEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement and instead\nreferred to his proposal to “direc[t] over $21⁄2 billion in the next year\nmainly towards improving the education of children from poor fami\nlies.” Id., at 591. But in any event, this general statement, made in a\npresidential speech two years prior to the enactment of the EEOA,\nsurely sheds little light on the proper interpretation of the statute.\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

In\nNovember 2000, Arizona voters passed Proposition 203,\nwhich mandated statewide implementation of a “struc\ntured English immersion” (SEI) approach. See App. to\nPet. for Cert. in No. 08–294, p. 369a. Proposition 203\ndefines this methodology as follows:\n    “ ‘Sheltered English immersion’ or ‘structured English\n    immersion’ means an English language acquisition\n    process for young children in which nearly all class\n    room instruction is in English but with the curriculum\n    and presentation designed for children who are learn\n    ing the language. . . . Although teachers may use a\n    minimal amount of the child’s native language when\n    necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any\n    language other than English, and children in this pro\n    gram learn to read and write solely in English.” Ariz.\n    Rev.

It required that all\nschool districts and charter schools select one of the\nadopted SEI models, §15–756.02(A), and it created an\n“Office of English language acquisition services” to aid\nschool districts in implementation of the models. §15–\n756.07(1). It also required the State Board of Education to\ninstitute a uniform and mandatory training program for\nall SEI instructors. §15–756.09.\n  Research on ELL instruction indicates there is docu\nmented, academic support for the view that SEI is signifi\ncantly more effective than bilingual education.10 Findings\nof the Arizona State Department of Education in 2004\nstrongly support this conclusion.11 In light of this, a\nproper analysis of petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should\n——————\n   9 By focusing on the adequacy of HB 2064’s funding provisions, the\n\ncourts below neglected to address adequately the potential relevance of\nthese programming provisions, which became effective immediately\nupon enactment of the law.\n   10 See Brief for American Unity Legal Defense Fund et al. as Amici\n\nCuriae 10–12 (citing sources, including New York City Board of Educa\ntion, Educational Progress of Students in Bilingual and ESL Programs:\na Longitudinal Study, 1990–1994 (1994); K.

NCLB conditions the\ncontinued receipt of funds on demonstrations of “adequate\nyearly progress.” Ibid.\n   As relevant here, Title III (the English Language Acqui\nsition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achieve\nment Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students\n“attain English proficiency, develop high levels of aca\ndemic attainment in English, and meet the same challeng\ning State academic content and student academic\nachievement standards as all children are expected to\nmeet.” §6812(1). It requires States to set annual objective\nachievement goals for the number of students who will\nannually progress toward proficiency, achieve proficiency,\nand make “adequate yearly progress” with respect to\nacademic achievement, §6842(a), and it holds local schools\nand agencies accountable for meeting these objectives,\n§6842(b).\n   Petitioners argue that through compliance with NCLB,\nthe State has established compliance with the EEOA.\n\f26                       HORNE v.

Approval of a NCLB plan does not\nentail substantive review of a State’s ELL programming or\na determination that the programming results in equal\neducational opportunity for ELL students. See §6823.\nMoreover, NCLB contains a saving clause, which provides\nthat “[n]othing in this part shall be construed in a manner\ninconsistent with any Federal law guaranteeing a civil\nright.” §6847.\n   This does not mean, however, that NCLB is not relevant\nto petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion.

First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the\nabsence of longitudinal data in the record precludes useful compari\nsons. See id., at 1155. Second, the AIMS tests—the statewide\nachievement tests on which the Court of Appeals primarily relied and\nto which the dissent cites in Appendix A of its opinion—are adminis\ntered in English.

Third, the negative data that the Court of Appeals\nhighlights is balanced by positive data.

But the Court\nof Appeals missed the legal import of this observation—\nthat these reforms might have brought Nogales’ ELL\nprogramming into compliance with the EEOA even with\nout sufficient ELL incremental funding to satisfy the\nDistrict Court’s original order. Instead, the Court of Ap\npeals concluded that to credit Cooper’s reforms would\n“penaliz[e]” Nogales “for doing its best to make do, despite\nArizona’s failure to comply with the terms of the judg\nment,” and would “absolve the state from providing ade\nquate ELL incremental funding as required by the judg\nment.”    Id., at 1168.

Its ultimate focus is on the quality of educa\ntional programming and services provided to students, not\nthe amount of money spent on them. Accordingly, there is\nno statutory basis for precluding petitioners from showing\nthat Nogales has achieved EEOA-compliant programming\nby means other than increased funding—for example,\nthrough Cooper’s structural, curricular, and accountabil\nity-based reforms.

In so doing, it foreclosed the\npossibility that petitioners could establish changed cir\ncumstances warranting relief through an overall increase\nin education funding available in Nogales.\n   This was clear legal error. As we have noted, the\nEEOA’s “appropriate action” requirement does not neces\nsarily require any particular level of funding, and to the\nextent that funding is relevant, the EEOA certainly does\nnot require that the money come from any particular\nsource. In addition, the EEOA plainly does not give the\nfederal courts the authority to judge whether a State or a\nschool district is providing “appropriate” instruction in\nother subjects. That remains the province of the States\nand the local schools. It is unfortunate if a school, in order\nto fund ELL programs, must divert money from other\nworthwhile programs, but such decisions fall outside the\nscope of the EEOA. Accordingly, the analysis of petition\ners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion should evaluate whether the\nState’s budget for general education funding, in addition\nto any local revenues,22 is currently supporting EEOA\ncompliant ELL programming in Nogales.\n   Because the lower courts engaged in an inadequate Rule\n60(b)(5) analysis, and because the District Court failed to\nmake up-to-date factual findings, the analysis of the lower\ncourts was incomplete and inadequate with respect to all\nof the changed circumstances just noted. These changes\nare critical to a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis, however, as\nthey may establish that Nogales is no longer in violation of\n——————\n  22 Each year since 2000, Nogales voters have passed an override.\n\nRevenues from Nogales’ override have increased from $895,891 in 2001\nto $1,674,407 in 2007.

If this\nis the case, continued enforcement of the District Court’s\noriginal order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule\n60(b)(5), and relief is warranted.\n                              IV\n   We turn, finally, to the District Court’s entry of state\nwide relief.23 The Nogales district, which is situated along\nthe Mexican border, is one of 239 school districts in the\nState of Arizona. Nogales students make up about one\nhalf of one per cent of the entire State’s school popula\ntion.24 The record contains no factual findings or evidence\nthat any school district other than Nogales failed (much\nless continues to fail) to provide equal educational oppor\ntunities to ELL students. See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\n08–294, pp. 177a–178a. Nor have respondents explained\nhow the EEOA could justify a statewide injunction when\nthe only violation claimed or proven was limited to a\nsingle district. See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 89–90; Milliken,\n433 U. S., at 280. It is not even clear that the District\nCourt had jurisdiction to issue a statewide injunction\n——————\n   23 The dissent contends that this issue was not raised below, but what\n\nis important for present purposes is that, for the reasons explained in\nthe previous parts of this opinion, these cases must be remanded to the\nDistrict Court for a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis. Petitioners made it\nclear at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated. See Tr. of\nOral Arg. 63 (“Here the EEOA has been transmogrified to apply state\nwide. That has not been done before. It should not have been done in\nthe first instance but certainly in light of the changed circumstances”);\nsee also id., at 17–18, 21, 26. Accordingly, if petitioners raise that\nargument on remand, the District Court must consider whether there is\nany legal or factual basis for denying that relief.\n   24 See Ariz.

We are told that the former attorney general\n“affirmatively urged a statewide remedy because a ‘No\ngales only’ remedy would run afoul of the Arizona Consti\ntution’s requirement of ‘a general and uniform public\nschool system.’ ” Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 38\n(quoting Ariz. Const., Art. 11, §1(A) (some internal quota\ntion marks omitted)).\n   This concern did not provide a valid basis for a state\nwide federal injunction. If the state attorney general\nbelieved that a federal injunction requiring increased ELL\nspending in one district necessitated, as a matter of state\nlaw, a similar increase in every other district in the State,\nthe attorney general could have taken the matter to the\nstate legislature or the state courts. But the attorney\ngeneral did not do so. Even if she had, it is not clear what\nthe result would have been. It is a question of state law,\nto be determined by state authorities, whether the equal\nfunding provision of the Arizona Constitution would re\nquire a statewide funding increase to match Nogales’ ELL\nfunding, or would leave Nogales as a federally compelled\nexception. By failing to recognize this, and by entering a\nstatewide injunction that intruded deeply into the State’s\nbudgetary processes based solely on the attorney general’s\ninterpretation of state law, the District Court obscured\naccountability for the drastic remedy that it entered.\n   When it is unclear whether an onerous obligation is the\nwork of the Federal or State Government, accountability is\ndiminished.

The\nState of Arizona, the Arizona Board of Education, and the\noriginal plaintiffs in the case (representing students from\nNogales, Arizona) opposed the superintendent’s Rule\n60(b)(5) motion. They are respondents here.\n   The District Court, after taking evidence and holding\neight days of hearings, considered all the changed circum­\nstances that the parties called to its attention. The court\nconcluded that some relevant “changes” had taken place.\nBut the court ultimately found those changes insufficient\nto warrant setting aside the original judgment. The Court\nof Appeals, in a carefully reasoned 41-page opinion, af­\nfirmed that district court determination. This Court now\nsets the Court of Appeals’ decision aside. And it does so, it\nsays, because “the lower courts focused excessively on the\nnarrow question of the adequacy of the State’s incremental\nfunding for [English-learning] instruction instead of fairly\nconsidering the broader question, whether, as a result of\nimportant changes during the intervening years, the State\nwas fulfilling its obligation” under the Act “by other\nmeans.” Ante, at 2 (emphasis added).\n   The Court reaches its ultimate conclusion—that the\nlower courts did not “fairly consider” the changed circum­\nstances—in a complicated way. It begins by placing this\ncase in a category it calls “institutional reform litigation.”\nAnte, at 10. It then sets forth special “institutional reform\nlitigation” standards applicable when courts are asked to\nmodify judgments and decrees entered in such cases. It\napplies those standards, and finds that the lower courts\ncommitted error.\n   I disagree with the Court for several reasons. For one\nthing, the “institutional reform” label does not easily fit\nthis case. For another, the review standards the Court\nenunciates for “institutional reform” cases are incomplete\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

Finally,\nmy own review of the record convinces me that the Court\nis wrong regardless. The lower courts did “fairly consider”\nevery change in circumstances that the parties called to\ntheir attention. The record more than adequately supports\nthis conclusion. In a word, I fear that the Court misap­\nplies an inappropriate procedural framework, reaching a\nresult that neither the record nor the law adequately\nsupports.

I must initially focus upon the Court’s basic\ncriticism of the lower courts’ analysis, namely that the\nlower courts somehow lost sight of the forest for the trees.\nIn the majority’s view, those courts—as well as this dis­\nsent—wrongly focused upon a subsidiary matter, “incre­\nmental” English-learning program “funding,” rather than\nthe basic matter, whether “changes” had cured, or had\ncome close to curing, the violation of federal law that\nunderlay the original judgment. Ante, at 2. In the Court’s\nview, it is as if a district court, faced with a motion to\ndissolve a school desegregation decree, focused only upon\nthe school district’s failure to purchase 50 decree-required\nschool buses, instead of discussing the basic question,\nwhether the schools had become integrated without need\nfor those 50 buses.\n  Thus the Court writes that the lower courts focused so\nheavily on the original decree’s “incremental funding”\nrequirement that they failed to ask whether “the State\n\f4                     HORNE v.

The Court adds that the District Court too was\nwrong to have “asked only whether petitioners had satis­\nfied the original declaratory judgment order through\nincreased incremental funding.” Ante, at 19.\n   The problem with this basic criticism is that the State’s\nprovision of adequate resources to its English-learning\nstudents, i.e., what the Court refers to as “incremental\nfunding,” has always been the basic contested issue in this\ncase. That is why the lower courts continuously focused\nattention directly upon it. In the context of this case they\nlooked directly at the forest, not the trees. To return to\nthe school desegregation example, the court focused upon\nthe heart of the matter, the degree of integration, and not\nupon the number of buses the school district had pur­\nchased. A description of the statutory context and the\nhistory of this case makes clear that the Court cannot\nsensibly drive a wedge (as it wishes to do) between what it\ncalls the “incremental funding” issue and the uncured\nfailure to comply with the requirements of federal law.\n                              1\n  The lawsuit filed in this case charged a violation of\nsubsection (f) of §204 of the Equal Educational Opportuni­\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

First, the court should\n“ascertain” whether the school system, in respect to stu­\ndents who are not yet proficient in English, “is pursuing”\nan English-learning program that is “informed by an\neducational theory recognized as sound by some experts in\nthe field or, at least, deemed a legitimate experimental\nstrategy.” Ibid. Second, that court should determine\n“whether the programs and practices actually used by\n[the] school system are reasonably calculated to imple­\nment effectively the educational theory adopted by the\nschool,” which is to say that the school system must “fol­\nlow through with practices, resources and personnel neces­\nsary to transform” its chosen educational theory “into\nreality.” Id., at 1010 (emphasis added). Third, if prac­\ntices, resources, and personnel are adequate, the court\nshould go on to ascertain whether there is some indication\nthat the programs produce “results,” i.e., that “the lan­\nguage barriers confronting students are actually being\novercome.” Ibid.\n   Courts in other Circuits have followed Castaneda’s\napproach.

In 1992, they\nfiled the present lawsuit against the State of Arizona, its\nBoard of Education, and the superintendent, claiming that\nthe State had violated subsection (f), not by failing to\nadopt proper English-learning programs, but by failing “to\nprovide financial and other resources necessary” to make\nthose programs a practical reality for Spanish-speaking\nstudents. App. 7, ¶20 (emphasis added); see Castaneda,\nsupra, at 1010 (second, i.e., “resource,” requirement). In\nparticular, they said, “[t]he cost” of programs that would\nallow those students to learn effectively, say, to read\nEnglish at a proficient level, “far exceeds the only financial\nassistance the State theoretically provides.” App. 7,\n¶20(a).\n   The students sought a declaration that the State had\n“systematically . . . failed or refused to provide fiscal as\nwell as other resources sufficient to enable” the Nogales\nSchool District and other “similarly situated [school] dis­\ntricts” to “establish and maintain” successful programs for\nEnglish learners. Id., at 10, ¶28. And they sought an\nappropriate injunction requiring the provision of such\nresources. The state defendants answered the com­\nplaint.

The bill would\nalso increase the appropriation for teaching English to\nstudents who needed to learn it (though it prohibited the\nspending of any increase upon any particular student for\nmore than two years). In March 2006, the petitioners here\n(the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction, the\nPresident of Arizona’s Senate, and the Speaker of its\nHouse of Representatives) asked the District Court (1) to\nconsider whether HB 2064, as enacted, would satisfy its\njudgment and injunctive orders, (2) to forgive the con­\ntempt fine liability that the State had accrued, and (3) to\ndissolve the injunctive orders and grant relief from the\n2000 judgment.

Id., at 5–8.\nThe parties said that, in light of these “dramatic” addi­\ntions to the funding available for education in Arizona, the\ncourt should “declare the judgment and orders satisfied,\nand . . . relieve defendants from the judgment and orders\nunder Rule 60(b)(5).” Id., at 8.\n   In April 2006, the District Court held that HB 2064 by\nitself did not adequately satisfy the court’s orders; it de­\nnied the request to forgive the fines; but it did not decide\nthe petitioners’ Rule 60(b)(5) motion. In August 2006, the\nCourt of Appeals ordered the District Court to decide that\nmotion, and, in particular, to consider whether changes to\n“the landscape of educational funding . . . required modifi­\ncation of the original court order or otherwise had a bear­\ning on the appropriate remedy.” 204 Fed. Appx. 580, 582\n(CA9 2006) (memorandum).\n   In January 2007, the District Court held a hearing that\nlasted eight days and produced an evidentiary transcript\nof 1,684 pages. The hearing focused on the changes that\nthe petitioners said had occurred and justified setting\naside the original judgment. The petitioners pointed to\nthree sets of changed circumstances—all related to “prac­\ntices, resources, and personnel”—which, in their view,\nshowed that the judgment and the related orders were no\nlonger necessary. They argued that the changes had\nbrought the State into compliance with the Act’s require­\nments. The three sets of changes consisted of (1) increases\nin the amount of funding available to Arizona school dis­\ntricts; (2) changes in the method of English-learning in­\nstruction; and (3) changes in the administration of the\nNogales school district. These changes, the petitioners\nsaid, had cured the resource-linked deficiencies that were\nnoted in the District Court’s 2000 judgment, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s conclusions,\nsetting forth its reasons, as I have said, in a lengthy and\ndetailed opinion. The state superintendent, along with the\nSpeaker of the Arizona House of Representatives and the\nPresident of the Arizona Senate, sought certiorari, and we\ngranted the petition.\n                              B\n   Five conclusions follow from the description of the case I\nhave just set forth. First, the Rule 60(b)(5) “changes” upon\nwhich the District Court focused included the “changed\nteaching methods” and the “changed administrative sys-\ntems” that the Court criticizes the District Court for ignor-\ning. Compare ante, at 23–25, 29–31, with Parts III–A, III–\nC, infra. Those changes were, in the petitioners’ view,\nrelated to the “funding” issue, for those changes reduced\nthe need for increased funding. See Motion to Purge, p. 7.\nI concede that the majority of the District Court’s factual\nfindings focused on funding, see ante, at 20. But where is\nthe legal error, given that the opinion clearly shows that\nthe District Court considered, “ ‘focus[ed]’ ” upon, and\nwrote about all the matters petitioners raised?

That is, the sole subsec­\ntion (f) dispute in the case originally was whether the\nState provides the “practices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary” to implement its English-learning program.\nCastaneda, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1010. To be sure, as the Court\npoints out, changes other than to the State’s funding\nsystem could demonstrate that Nogales was receiving the\nnecessary resources. See, e.g., ante, at 23–25. But given\nthe centrality of “resources” to the case, it is hardly sur­\nprising that the courts below scrutinized the State’s provi­\nsion of “incremental funding,” but without ignoring the\nother related changes to which petitioners pointed, such as\nchanges in teaching methods and administration (all of\nwhich the District Court rejected as insufficient). See Part\nIII, infra.\n   Third, the type of issue upon which the District Court\nand Court of Appeals focused lies at the heart of the statu­\ntory demand for equal educational opportunity. A State’s\nfailure to provide the “practices, resources, and personnel\nnecessary” to eliminate the educational burden that ac­\ncompanies a child’s inability to speak English is precisely\nwhat the statute forbids. See Castaneda, supra, at 1010\n(emphasizing the importance of providing “resources”);\nNixon Address 593 (referring to the importance of provid­\ning “financial support”). And no one in this case suggests\nthere is no need for those resources, e.g., that there are no\nextra costs associated with English-learning education\nirrespective of the teaching method used.            English­\nlearning students, after all, not only require the instruc­\ntion in “academic content areas” like math and science\nthat “typical” students require, but they also need to\nincrease their proficiency in speaking, reading, and writ­\ning English. This language-acquisition instruction re­\nquires particular textbooks and other instructional mate­\nrials, teachers trained in the school’s chosen method for\n\f14                    HORNE v.

Rather in all essential respects they\nare one and the same issue. In focusing upon the one, the\nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals were focusing upon\nthe other. For all practical purposes, changes that would\nhave proved sufficient to show the statutory violation\ncured would have proved sufficient to warrant setting\naside the original judgment and decrees, and vice versa.\nAnd in context, judges and parties alike were fully aware\nof the modification/violation relationship.

No. 631, p. 1 (argu­\ning that factual changes had led to “satisf[action]” of the\njudgment).\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

Of\ncourse, a State might violate the Act in other ways. But\none way in which a State can violate the Act is to fail to\nprovide necessary “practices, resources, and personnel.”\nAnd that is the way the District Court found that the\nState had violated the Act here. Thus, whatever might be\ntrue of some other case, in this case the failure to provide\nadequate resources and the underlying subsection (f)\nviolation were one and the same thing.\n   Fifth, the Court is wrong when it suggests that the\nDistrict Court ordered “increased incremental funding,”\nante, at 19; when it faults the District Court for effectively\n“dictating state or local budget priorities,” ante, at 11;\nwhen it claims that state officials welcomed the result “as\na means of achieving appropriations objectives,” ante, at\n10, n. 3; and when it implies that the District Court’s\norders required the State to provide a “particular level of\nfunding,” ante, at 33. The District Court ordered the State\nto produce a plan that set forth a “reasonable” or “ra­\ntional” relationship between the needs of English-learning\nstudents and the resources provided to them. The orders\nexpressed no view about what kind of English-learning\nprogram the State should use. Nor did the orders say\nanything about the amount of “appropriations” that the\nState must provide, ante, at 10, n. 3, or about any “particu­\nlar funding mechanism,” ante, at 18, that the State was\nobligated to create. Rather, the District Court left it up to\nthe State “to recommend [to the legislature] the level of\nfunding necessary to support the programs that it deter­\nmined to be the most effective.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Thus\nthe Court’s basic criticism of the lower court decisions is\nwithout foundation. I turn next to the Court’s discussion\nof the standards of review the Court finds applicable to\n“institutional reform” litigation.\n   To understand my concern about the Court’s discussion\nof standards, it is important to keep in mind the well­\nknown standards that ordinarily govern the evaluation of\nRule 60(b)(5) motions. The Rule by its terms permits\nmodification of a judgment or order (1) when “the judg­\nment has been satisfied,” (2) “released,” or (3) “dis­\ncharged;” when the judgment or order (4) “is based on an\nearlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated;” or (5)\n“applying [the judgment] prospectively is no longer equi­\ntable.” No one can claim that the second, third, or fourth\ngrounds are applicable here. The relevant judgment and\norders have not been released or discharged; nor is there\nany relevant earlier judgment that has been reversed or\nvacated. Thus the only Rule 60(b)(5) questions are\nwhether the judgment and orders have been satisfied, or,\nif not, whether their continued application is “equitable.”\nAnd, as I have explained, in context these come down to\nthe same question: Is continued enforcement inequitable\nbecause the defendants have satisfied the 2000 declara­\ntory judgment or at least have come close to doing so, and,\ngiven that degree of satisfaction, would it work unneces­\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

See supra,\nat 14.\n  To show sufficient inequity to warrant Rule 60(b)(5)\nrelief, a party must show that “a significant change either\nin factual conditions or in law” renders continued en­\nforcement of the judgment or order “detrimental to the\npublic interest.” Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384. The party can\nclaim that “the statutory or decisional law has changed to\nmake legal what the decree was designed to prevent.” Id.,\nat 388; see also Railway Employees v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106157\"><a href=\"/opinion/106157/system-federation-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651 (1961). Or the party can claim that relevant facts\nhave changed to the point where continued enforcement of\nthe judgment, order, or decree as written would work, say,\ndisproportionately serious harm. See Rufo, supra, at 384\n(modification may be appropriate when changed circum­\nstances make enforcement “substantially more onerous” or\n“unworkable because of unforeseen obstacles”).\n  The Court acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that Rufo’s “flexible standard” for relief applies.\nThe Court also acknowledges, as do I, as did the lower\ncourts, that this “flexible standard” does not itself define\nthe inquiry a court passing on a Rule 60(b)(5) motion must\nmake. To give content to this standard, the Court refers to\nMilliken v.

If not—i.e., if a current\nviolation of federal law cannot be detected—then “ ‘respon­\nsibility for discharging the State’s obligations [must be]\nreturned promptly to the State.’ ” Ante, at 15.\n   One problem with the Court’s discussion of its standards\nis that insofar as the considerations it mentions are widely\naccepted, the lower courts fully acknowledged and fol­\nlowed them. The decisions below, like most Rule 60(b)(5)\ndecisions, reflect the basic factors the Court mentions.\nThe lower court opinions indicate an awareness of the fact\nthat equitable decrees are subject to a “flexible standard”\npermitting modification when circumstances, factual or\nlegal, change significantly.      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1163; </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

See ante, at 10–13. The State did consent to a\nfew peripheral matters that have nothing to do with the\npresent appeal. App. 19–30. But the State vigorously\ncontested the plaintiffs’ basic original claim, namely, that\nthe State failed to take resource-related “appropriate\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

The State pre­\nsented proofs and evidence to the District Court designed\nto show that no violation of federal law had occurred, and\nit opposed entry of the original judgment and every subse­\nquent injunctive order, save the relief sought by petition­\ners here. I can find no evidence, beyond the Court’s specu­\nlation, showing that some state officials have “welcomed”\nthe District Court’s decision “as a means of achieving\nappropriations objectives that could not [otherwise] be\nachieved.” Ante, at 10, n. 3. But even were that so, why\nwould such a fact matter here more than in any other case\nin which some state employees believe a litigant who sues\nthe State is right? I concede that the State did not appeal\nthe District Court’s original order or the ensuing injunc­\ntions. But the fact that litigants refrain from appealing\ndoes not turn a litigated judgment into a “consent decree.”\nAt least, I have never before heard that term so used.\n   Regardless, the Court’s discussion of standards raises a\nfar more serious problem. In addition to the standards I\nhave discussed, supra, at 16–17, our precedents recognize\nother, here outcome-determinative, hornbook principles\nthat apply when a court evaluates a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.\nThe Court omits some of them. It mentions but fails to\napply others. As a result, I am uncertain, and perhaps\nothers will be uncertain, whether the Court has set forth a\ncorrect and workable method for analyzing a Rule 60(b)(5)\nmotion.\n   First, a basic principle of law that the Court does not\nmention—a principle applicable in this case as in others—\nis that, in the absence of special circumstances (e.g., plain\nerror), a judge need not consider issues or factors that the\nparties themselves do not raise. That principle of law is\nlongstanding, it is reflected in Blackstone, and it perhaps\ncomes from yet an earlier age. 3 Commentaries on the\nLaws of England 455 (1768) (“[I]t is a practice unknown to\nour law” when examining the decree of an inferior court,\n\f20                    HORNE v.

As we have recognized, it would be difficult to\noperate an adversary system of justice without applying\nsuch a principle. See Duignan v.

But the majority repeatedly considers\nprecisely such claims. See, e.g., ante, at 26–29 (consider­\ning significant matters not raised below); ante, at 34–36\n(same).\n   Second, a hornbook Rule 60(b)(5) principle, which the\nCourt mentions, ante, at 10, is that the party seeking\nrelief from a judgment or order “bears the burden of estab­\nlishing that a significant change in circumstances war­\nrants” that relief. Rufo, 502 U. S., at 383 (emphasis\nadded); cf. Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools\nv.

But the Court does not apply\nthat principle. See, e.g., ante, at 30–31, and n. 22 (holding\nthat movants potentially win because of failure of record\nto show that English-learning problems do not stem from\ncauses other than funding); see also ante, at 26–27 (criti­\ncizing lower courts for failing to consider argument not\nmade).\n   Third, the Court ignores the well-established distinction\nbetween a Rule 60(b)(5) request to modify an order and a\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrequest to set an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside—a\ndistinction that this Court has previously emphasized. Cf.\nRufo, supra, at 389, n. 12 (emphasizing that “we do not\nhave before us the question whether the entire decree\nshould be vacated”). Courts normally do the latter only if\nthe “party” seeking “to have” the “decree set aside en­\ntirely” shows “that the decree has served its purpose, and\nthere is no longer any need for the injunction.” 12 J.\nMoore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice §60.47 [2][c] (3d ed.\n2009) (hereinafter Moore). Instead of applying the distinc­\ntion, the majority says that the Court of Appeals “strayed”\nwhen it referred to situations in which changes justified\nsetting an unsatisfied judgment entirely aside as “ ‘likely\nrare.’ ” Ante, at 14.\n   Fourth, the Court says nothing about the well­\nestablished principle that a party moving under Rule\n60(b)(5) for relief that amounts to having a “decree set\naside entirely” must show both (1) that the decree’s objects\nhave been “attained,” Frew, 540 U. S., at 442, and (2) that\nit is unlikely, in the absence of the decree, that the unlaw­\nful acts it prohibited will again occur. This Court so held\nin Dowell, a case in which state defendants sought relief\nfrom a school desegregation decree on the ground that the\ndistrict was presently operating in compliance with the\nEqual Protection Clause. The Court agreed with the\ndefendants that “a finding by the District Court that the\nOklahoma City School District was being operated in\ncompliance with . . . the Equal Protection Clause” was\nindeed relevant to the question whether relief was appro­\npriate. 498 U. S., at 247. But the Court added that, to\nshow entitlement to relief, the defendants must also show\nthat “it was unlikely that the [school board] would return\nto its former ways.” Ibid. Only then would the “purposes\nof the desegregation litigation ha[ve] been fully achieved.”\nIbid. The principle, as applicable here, simply under­\nscores petitioners’ failure to show that the “changes” to\n\f22                    HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhich they pointed were sufficient to warrant entirely\nsetting aside the original court judgment.\n   Fifth, the majority mentions, but fails to apply, the basic\nRule 60(b)(5) principle that a party cannot dispute the\nlegal conclusions of the judgment from which relief is\nsought. A party cannot use a Rule 60(b)(5) motion as a\nsubstitute for an appeal, say, by attacking the legal rea­\nsoning underlying the original judgment or by trying to\nshow that the facts, as they were originally, did not then\njustify the order’s issuance.

Does\nthe Court intend to ignore one or more of these standards\nor to apply them differently in cases involving what it calls\n“institutional reform litigation”?\n   If so, the Court will find no support for its approach in\nthe cases to which it refers, namely Rufo, Milliken, and\nFrew. Rufo involved a motion to modify a complex court­\nmonitor-supervised decree designed to prevent overcrowd­\ning in a local jail. The Court stressed the fact that the\nmodification did not involve setting aside the entire de­\ncree. 502 U. S., at 389, n. 12. It made clear that the party\nseeking relief from an institutional injunction “bears the\nburden of establishing that a significant change in circum­\nstances warrants” that relief. Id., at 383. And it rejected\nthe argument that a reviewing court must determine, in\nevery case, whether an ongoing violation of federal law\nexists. Id., at 389, 390, and n. 12 (refusing to require a\nnew “ ‘constitutional decision every time an effort [is] made\nto enforce or modify’ ” a judgment or decree (emphasis\nadded)).\n   Frew addressed the question whether the Eleventh\nAmendment permits a federal district court to enforce a\nconsent decree against state officials seeking to bring the\nState into compliance with federal law. 540 U.

S., at 269,\n272. The Court said that a court decree must aim at\n“eliminating a condition” that violates federal law or\nwhich “flow[s] from” such a “violation.” Id., at 282. And it\nunanimously found that the remedy at issue was lawful.\n   These cases confirm the unfortunate fact that the Court\nhas failed fully to apply the six essential principles that I\nhave mentioned. If the Court does not intend any such\nmodifications of these traditional standards, then, as I\nshall show, it must affirm the Court of Appeals’ decision.\nBut if it does intend to modify them, as stated or in appli­\ncation, it now applies a new set of new rules that are not\nfaithful to our cases and which will create the dangerous\npossibility that orders, judgments, and decrees long final\nor acquiesced in, will be unwarrantedly subject to perpet­\nual challenge, offering defendants unjustifiable opportuni­\nties endlessly to relitigate underlying violations with the\nburden of proof imposed once again upon the plaintiffs.\n   I recognize that the Court’s decision, to a degree, reflects\none side of a scholarly debate about how courts should\nproperly handle decrees in “institutional reform litiga­\ntion.” Compare, in general, R. Sandler & D. Schoenbrod,\nDemocracy by Decree: What Happens When Courts Run\nGovernment (2003), with, e.g., Chayes, The Role of the\nJudge in Public Law Litigation, 89 Harv. L. Rev. 1281,\n1307–1309 (1976). But whatever the merits of that de­\nbate, this case does not involve the kind of “institutional\n\f26                    HORNE v.

To the contrary, the\nCourt of Appeals’ opinion is true to the record and fair to\nthe decision of the District Court. And the majority is\nwrong to conclude otherwise.\n                             III\n   If the Court’s criticism of the lower courts cannot rest\nupon what they did do, namely examine directly whether\nArizona had produced a rational funding program, it must\nrest upon what it believes they did not do, namely ade­\nquately consider the other changes in English-learning\ninstruction, administration, and the like to which petition­\ners referred. Indeed, the Court must believe this, for it\norders the lower courts, on remand, to conduct a “proper\nexamination” of “four important factual and legal changes\nthat may warrant the granting of relief from the judg­\nment:” (1) the “adoption of a new . . . instructional meth­\nodology” for teaching English; (2) “Congress’ enactment” of\nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §6842 et\nseq.; (3) “structural and management reforms in Nogales,”\nand (4) “increased overall education funding.” Ante, at 23.\n   The Court cannot accurately hold, however, that the\nlower courts failed to conduct a “proper examination” of\nthese claims, ibid., for the District Court considered three\nof them, in detail and at length, while petitioners no where\nraised the remaining argument, which has sprung full­\ngrown from the Court’s own brow, like Athena from the\nbrow of Zeus.\n\f28                    HORNE v.

Ante, at 23. How can\nthe majority suggest that the lower courts failed properly\nto “examine” this matter?\n   First, more than two days of the District Court’s eight­\nday evidentiary hearing were devoted to precisely this\nmatter, namely the claim pressed below by petitioners\nthat “[t]he adoption of English immersion” constitutes a\n“substantial advancemen[t] in assisting” English learners\n“to become English proficient.” Hearing Memorandum,\nNo. CV–92–596–TUC–RCC (D. Ariz.), Dkt. No. 588, pp. 4–\n5. The State’s Director of English Acquisition, Irene Mo­\nreno, described the new method as “the most effective”\nway to teach English. Tr. 19 (Jan. 9, 2007). An educa­\ntional consultant, Rosalie Porter, agreed. Id., at 95–96.\nPetitioners’ witnesses also described a new assessment\ntest, the Arizona English Language Learner Assessment,\nid., at 50–51; they described new curricular models that\nwould systematize instructional methods, id., at 78; they\nexplained that all teachers would eventually be required\nto obtain an “endorsement” demonstrating their expertise\nin the chosen instructional method, see Proposed Findings\nof Fact and Conclusions of Law, No. CV–92–596–TUC–\nRCC (D.

What “further factual findings,” ante, at 25, are\nneeded? As I have explained, the District Court was not\nobligated to relitigate the case. See supra, at 21–22.

How can the ma­\njority conclude that “further factual findings” are neces­\nsary?\n   Perhaps the majority does not mean to suggest that the\nlower courts failed properly to examine these changes in\nteaching methods. Perhaps it means to express its belief\nthat the lower courts reached the wrong conclusion. After\nall, the Court refers to a “documented, academic support\n\f30                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nfor the view that” structured English immersion “is sig­\nnificantly more effective than bilingual education.” Ante,\nat 24.\n   It is difficult to see how the majority can substitute its\njudgment for the District Court’s judgment on this ques­\ntion, however, for that judgment includes a host of sub­\nsidiary fact-related determinations that warrant defer­\nence. Railway Employees, 364 U. S., at 647–648 (“Where\nthere is . . . a balance of imponderables there must be\nwide discretion in the District Court”). And, despite con­\nsiderable evidence showing improvement, there was also\nconsiderable evidence the other way, evidence that sup­\nported the District Court’s view that it would be “prema­\nture” to set aside the judgment of violation.\n   The methodological change was introduced in Arizona in\nlate 2000, and in Nogales it was a work in progress, “[t]o\none degree or another,” as of June 2005. Tr. 10 (Jan. 12,\n2007); ante, at 25. As of 2006, the State’s newest struc­\ntured English immersion models had not yet taken effect.\nTr. 138 (Jan. 17, 2007) (“We’re getting ready to hopefully\nput down some models for districts to choose from”). The\nState had adopted its new assessment test only the previ­\nous year. App. 164–165. The testimony about the extent\nto which Nogales had adopted the new teaching system\nwas unclear and conflicting. Compare Tr. 96 (Jan. 9,\n2007) with Tr. 10 (Jan. 12, 2007). And, most importantly,\nthere was evidence that the optimistic improvement in the\nnumber of students completing the English-learning pro­\ngram was considerably overstated. See Tr. 37 (Jan. 18,\n2007) (stating that the assessment test used in 2005 and\n2006, when dramatic improvements had been reported,\nwas significantly less “rigorous” and consequently had\nbeen replaced). The State’s own witnesses were unable\nfirmly to conclude that the new system had so far pro­\nduced significantly improved results. Tr. 112–113 (Jan.\n11, 2007) (stating that “at some point” it would be possible\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U. S. ____ (2009)           31\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nto tell how quickly the new system leads to English profi­\nciency (emphasis added)).\n  Faced with this conflicting evidence, the District Court\nconcluded that it was “premature” to dissolve the decree\non the basis of changes in teaching (and related standards\nand assessment) methodology. Given the underlying\nfactual disputes (about, e.g., the reliability of the testing\nmethod), how can this Court now hold that the District\nCourt, and the appellate court that affirmed its conclu­\nsions, were legally wrong?\n                              B\n   The second change that the Court says the lower courts\nshould properly “examine” is the “enactment” of the No\nChild Left Behind Act. Ante, at 25. The Court concedes,\nhowever, that both courts did address the only argument\nabout that “enactment” that the petitioners made, namely,\nthat “compliance” with that new law automatically consti­\ntutes compliance with subsection (f)’s “ ‘appropriate ac­\ntion’ ” requirement. Ante, at 26; see also, e.g., App. 73\n(arguing that the new law “preempts” subsection (f)). And\nthe Court today agrees (as do I) that the lower courts\nproperly rejected that argument. Ante, at 26.\n   Instead, the Court suggests that the lower courts\nwrongly failed to take account of four other ways in which\nthe new Act is “probative,” namely (1) its prompting “sig­\nnificant structural and programming” changes, (2) its\nincreases in “federal funding,” (3) “its assessment and\nreporting requirements,” and (4) its “shift in federal edu­\ncation policy.” Ante, at 26–28. In fact, the lower courts\ndid take account of the changes in structure, program­\nming, and funding (including federal funding) relevant to\nthe English-learning program in Nogales and elsewhere in\nthe State. See Part III–A, supra; Parts III–C and III–D,\ninfra. But, I agree with the Court that the District Court\ndid not explicitly relate its discussion to the new Act nor\n\f32                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndid it take account of what the majority calls a “shift in\nfederal education policy.” Ante, at 28.\n  The District Court failed to do what the Court now\ndemands for one simple reason. No one (with the possible\nexception of the legislators, who hint at the matter in their\nreply brief filed in this Court) has ever argued that the\nDistrict Court should take account of any such “change.”\nBut see ante, at 26, and n. 12.\n  As I have explained, see supra, at 19–20, it is well­\nestablished that a district court rarely commits legal error\nwhen it fails to take account of a “change” that no one\ncalled to its attention or fails to reply to an argument that\nno one made. See, e.g., Dowell, 498 U. S., at 249 (party\nseeking relief from judgment must make a “sufficient\nshowing”). A district court must construe fairly the argu­\nments made to it; but it is not required to conjure up\nquestions never squarely presented. That the Court of\nAppeals referred to an argument resembling the Court’s\nnew assertion does not change the underlying legal fact.\nThe District Court committed no legal error in failing to\nconsider it. The Court of Appeals could properly reach the\nsame conclusion. And the Government, referring to the\nargument here, does not ask for reversal or remand on\nthat, or on any other, basis.\n  That is not surprising, since the lower courts have con­\nsistently and explicitly held that “flexibility cannot be\nused to relieve the moving party of its burden to establish\nthat” dissolution is warranted.

The\nevidence before the District Court was mixed. It consisted\nof some evidence showing administrative reform and\nmanagerial improvement in Nogales. Ante, at 29–30. At\nthe same time other evidence, to which the Court does not\nrefer, shows that these reforms did not come close to cur­\ning the problem. The record shows, for example, that the\ngraduation rate in 2005 for English-learning students\n(59%) was significantly below the average for all students\n(75%). App. 195. It shows poor performance by English­\nlearning students, compared with English-speaking stu­\ndents, on Arizona’s content-based standardized tests. See\nAppendix A, infra. This was particularly true at Nogales’\nsole high school—which Arizona ranked 575th out of its\n629 schools on an educational department survey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1159—where only 28% of ELL students passed\nthose standardized tests. Ibid.\n   The record also contains testimony from Guillermo\nZamudio, who in 2005 succeeded Cooper as Nogales’ su­\nperintendent, and who described numerous relevant “re­\nsource-related” deficiencies: Lack of funding meant that\nNogales had to rely upon long-term substitute and “emer­\ngency certified” teachers without necessary training and\nexperience. Tr. 45 (Jan. 18, 2007). Nogales needed addi­\ntional funding to hire trained teachers’ aides—a “strong\ncomponent” of its English-learning program, id., at 47.\nAnd Nogales’ funding needs forced it to pay a starting base\nsalary to its teachers about 14% below the state average,\nmaking it difficult to recruit qualified teachers.

How can the Court say\nthat this conclusion is unreasonable? What is the legal\nbasis for concluding that the District Court acted beyond\nthe scope of its lawful authority?\n   In fact, the Court does not even try to claim that the\nDistrict Court’s conclusion is unreasonable. Rather it\nenigmatically says that the District Court made “insuffi­\ncient factual findings” to support the conclusion that an\nongoing violation of law exists. Ante, at 31–32. By “insuf­\nficient,” the Court does not mean nonexistent. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Nor can it mean that the\nDistrict Court’s findings were skimpy or unreasonable.\nThat court simply drew conclusions on the basis of evi­\ndence it acknowledged was mixed. Id., at 1160–1161.\nWhat is wrong with those findings, particularly if viewed\nwith appropriate deference?\n   At one point the Court says that there “are many possi­\nble causes” of Nogales’ difficulties and that the lower\ncourts failed to “take into account other variables that\nmay explain” the ongoing deficiencies. Ante, at 32 and\nn. 20. But to find a flaw here is to claim that the plaintiffs\nhave failed to negate the possibility that these other\ncauses, not the State’s resource failures, explain Nogales’\npoor performance. To say this is to ignore well-established\nlaw that accords deference to the District Court’s fact­\nrelated judgments. See supra, at 22–23. The Court’s\nstatements reflect the acknowledgment that the evidence\nbelow was mixed. Given that acknowledgment, it is clear\n\f36                   HORNE v. FLORES\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthat the District Court did not abuse its discretion in\nfinding that petitioners had not shown sufficient “changed\ncircumstances.” And it was petitioners’ job, as the moving\nparty, to show that compliance with federal law has been\nachieved. Where “other variables” make it difficult to\nconclude that a present violation does or does not exist,\nwhat error does the District Court commit if it concludes\nthat the moving party has failed to satisfy that burden?\n                               D\n  The fourth “change” that the Court suggests the lower\ncourts did not properly “examine” consists of an “overall\nincrease in the education funding available in Nogales.”\nAnte, at 32. Again, the Court is wrong to suggest that the\nDistrict Court failed fully to examine the matter, for de­\nspite the Court’s assertions to the contrary, it made a\nnumber of “up-to-date factual findings,” ante, at 33, on the\nmatter, see </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1161–1164. Those findings\nreflect that the State had developed an educational plan\nthat raised the “base level amount” for the typical student\nfrom $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to $3,570 in 2006 (in con­\nstant 2006 dollars), ante, at 32, n. 21; and that plan in­\ncreased the additional (i.e., “weighted”) amount that would\nbe available per English-learning student from $182 to\n$349 (in 2006 dollars). The State contended that this new\nplan, with its explanation of how the money needed would\nbe forthcoming from federal, as well as from state, sources,\nmet subsection (f)’s requirement for “appropriate action”\n(as related to “resources”) and the District Court’s own\ninsistence upon a mechanism that rationally funded those\nresources. See Appendix B, infra.\n  Once again the Court’s “factual-finding” criticism seems,\nin context, to indicate its disagreement with the lower\ncourts’ resolution of this argument. That is to say, the\nCourt seems to disagree with the District Court’s conclu­\nsion that, even with the new funding, the State failed to\n\f                 Cite as: 557 U.

For one thing, the funding plan dem­\nonstrates that, in 2006, 69% of the available funding was\ntargeted at “base level” education, see Appendix B, infra,\ni.e., it was funding available to provide students with basic\neducational services like instruction in mathematics,\nscience, and so forth. See Tr. 110 (Jan. 12, 2007). The\nDistrict Court found that this funding likely would not\nbecome available for English-learning programs.\n   How is that conclusion unreasonable? If these funds are\nprovided for the provision of only basic services, how can\nthe majority now decide that a school district—\nparticularly a poor school district like Nogales—would be\nable to cover the additional expenses associated with\nEnglish-learning education while simultaneously manag­\ning to provide for its students’ basic educational needs?\nIndeed, the idea is particularly impractical when applied\nto a district like Nogales, which has a high percentage of\nstudents who need extra resources. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1262880\"><a href=\"/opinion/1262880/flores-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at 1145\n(approximately 90% of Nogales’ students were, or had\nbeen, enrolled in the English-learning program in 2006).\nWhere the vast majority of students in a district are those\nwho “need extra help” which “costs extra money,” it is\ndifficult to imagine where one could find an untapped\nstream of funding that could cover those additional costs.\n   For another thing, the petitioners’ witnesses conceded\nthat the State had not yet determined the likely costs to\nschool districts of teaching English learners using the\nstructured English immersion method. See, e.g., Tr. 199–\n200 (Jan. 17, 2007). The legislators reported that the\nState had recently asked a task force to “determine” the\nextra costs associated with implementing the structured\n\f38                    HORNE v.

But that task\nforce had not yet concluded its work.\n  Further, the District Court doubted that the federal\nportion of the funding identified by the petitioners would\nbe available for English-learning programs. It character­\nized certain federal grant money, included in the petition­\ners’ calculus of available funds, as providing only “short­\nterm” assistance, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

And testimony\nat the evidentiary hearing indicated that some of the\nfunds identified by petitioners might not in fact be avail­\nable to Nogales’ schools. See Tr. 59–61 (Jan. 10, 2007). It\nalso noted that certain funds were restricted, meaning\nthat no particular English-learning child could benefit\nfrom them for more than two years—despite the fact that\nEnglish-learning students in Nogales on average spend\nfour to five years in that program. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The District\nCourt concluded that the State’s funding plan was in large\npart unworkable in light of this restriction. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the District Court relied in part upon the\ntestimony of Thomas Fagan, a former United States De­\npartment of Education employee and an “expert” on this\ntype of federal funding. Fagan testified that Arizona’s\nplan was a “ ‘blatant violation’ ” of the relevant laws, which\ncould result in a loss to the State of over $600 million in\nfederal funds—including those federal funds the State’s\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

What error? Where is the error? The\nCourt does say earlier in its opinion that the lower courts\n“should not” have “disregarded” the relevant federal (i.e.,\nNo Child Left Behind Act) funds “just because they are not\nstate funds.” Ante, at 27. But the District Court did not\ndisregard those funds “just because they are not state\nfunds.” Nor did it “foreclos[e] the possibility that petition­\ners could” show entitlement to relief by pointing to “an\noverall increase in education funding.” Ante, at 33.\nRather, the District Court treated those increased funds\nas potentially unavailable, primarily because their use as\nplanned would violate federal law and would thereby\nthreaten the State with total loss of the stream of federal\nfunding it planned to use. It concluded that the State’s\nplan amounted to “ ‘a blatant violation’ ” of federal law, and\nremarked that “the potential loss of federal funds is sub­\nstantial.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It\ndoes say, earlier in its opinion, that some believe that\n“increased funding alone does not improve student\nachievement,” ante, at 28 (emphasis added), and it refers\nto nine studies that suggest that increased funding does\nnot always help. See ante, at 28–31, nn. 17–19; see also\nBrief for Education-Policy Scholars as Amici Curiae 7–11\n(discussing such scholarship). I do not know what this has\nto do with the matter. But if it is relevant to today’s deci­\nsion, the Court should also refer to the many studies that\ncast doubt upon the results of the studies it cites. See,\ne.g., H. Ladd & J. Hansen, Making Money Matter: Financ­\ning America’s Schools 140–147 (1999); Hess, Understand­\ning Achievement (and Other) Changes Under Chicago\n\f40                     HORNE v.

The question here is whether the\nState has shown that its new funding program amounts to\na “change” that satisfies subsection (f)’s requirement. The\nDistrict Court found it did not. Nothing this Court says\ncasts doubt on the legal validity of that conclusion.\n                                IV\n   The Court’s remaining criticisms are not well founded.\nThe Court, for example, criticizes the Court of Appeals for\nhaving referred to the “circumstances” that “warrant Rule\n60(b)(5) relief as ‘likely rare,’ ” for having said the petition­\ners would have to “sweep away” the District Court’s “fund­\ning determination” in order to prevail, for having spoken\nof the “landscape” as not being “so radically changed as to\njustify relief from judgment without compliance,” and for\nhaving somewhat diminished the “close[ness]” of its re­\nview for “federalism concerns” because the State and its\nBoard of Education “wish the injunction to remain in\nplace.” Ante, at 14–15 (first, second, and fourth emphases\nadded; internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The Court, however, does not explain the context in\nwhich the Court of Appeals’ statements appeared. That\ncourt used its first phrase (“likely rare”) to refer to the\nparticular kind of modification that the State sought,\n\f                  Cite as: 557 U.

Moore §60.47 [2][c].

At least, the Court does not point to other instances\nthat make it common. Uses of the word “sweeping” and\n“radica[l] change” in context refer to the deference owed to\nthe District Court’s 2000 legal determination. See id., at\n1168 (describing the 2000 order’s “basic determination”\nthat English-learning “programs require substantial state\nfunding in addition to that spent on basic educational\nprogramming”). If there is an error (which I doubt, see\nsupra, at 21–23) the error is one of tone, not of law.\n   Nor do I see any legal error that could have made a\ndifference when the Court of Appeals said it should down­\nplay the importance of federalism concerns because some\nelements of Arizona’s state government support the judg­\nment. I do not know the legal basis for the majority’s\nreference to this recalibration of judicial distance as “flatly\nincorrect,” but, if it is wrong, I still do not see how recali­\nbrating the recalibration could matter.\n   In sum, the majority’s decision to set aside the lower\ncourt decisions rests upon (1) a mistaken effort to drive a\nwedge between (a) review of funding plan changes and (b)\nreview of changes that would bring the State into compli­\nance with federal law, Part I, supra; (2) a misguided at­\ntempt to show that the lower courts applied the wrong\nlegal standards, Part II, supra; (3) a mistaken belief that\nthe lower courts made four specific fact-based errors, Part\nIII, supra; and (4) a handful of minor criticisms, Part IV,\nsupra and this page. By tracing each of these criticisms to\nits source in the record, I have tried to show that each is\nunjustified. Whether taken separately or together, they\n\f42                   HORNE v.

And it orders the District Court to vacate the\ninjunction “insofar as it extends beyond Nogales” unless\nthe court finds that “Arizona is violating” subsection (f)\n“on a statewide basis.” Ante, at 36.\n   What is the legal support for this part of the majority’s\nopinion? Prior to the appearance of this case in this Court,\nno one asked for that modification. Nothing in the law, as\nfar as I know, makes the relief somehow clearly erroneous.\nIndeed, as the majority recognizes, the reason that the\ninjunction runs statewide is that the State of Arizona, the\ndefendant in the litigation, asked the Court to enter that\nrelief. The State pointed in support to a state constitu­\ntional provision requiring educational uniformity. See\nante, at 35. There is no indication that anyone disputed\nwhether the injunction should have statewide scope. A\nstatewide program harmed Nogales’ students, App. 13–14,\n¶¶40, 42; and the State wanted statewide relief. What in\nthe law makes this relief erroneous?\n   The majority says that the District Court must consider\nthis matter because “[p]etitioners made it clear at oral\nargument that they wish to argue that the extension of the\nremedy to districts other than Nogales should be vacated.”\nAnte, at 34, n. 23. I find the matter less clear. I would\ndirect the reader to the oral argument transcript, which\nreads in part:\n     “Mr. Starr: What was entered here in this order,\n     which makes it so extraordinary, is that the entire\n     State funding mechanism has been interfered with by\n     the order.

In such cases, appellate courts are closer to the\nfray, better able to reach conclusions that are true to the\nrecord, and are more likely to treat trial court determina­\ntions fairly and with respect—as is clearly so here.\n   Second, insofar as the Court goes beyond the technical\nrecord-based aspects of this case and applies a new review\nframework, it risks problems in future cases. The frame­\nwork it applies is incomplete and lacks clear legal support\nor explanation. And it will be difficult for lower courts to\nunderstand and to apply that framework, particularly if it\nrests on a distinction between “institutional reform litiga­\ntion” and other forms of litigation. Does the Court mean\nto say, for example, that courts must, on their own, go\nbeyond a party’s own demands and relitigate an underly­\ning legal violation whenever that party asks for modifica­\ntion of an injunction? How could such a rule work in\npractice? See supra, at 21–23. Does the Court mean to\nsuggest that there are other special, strict pro-defendant\nrules that govern review of district court decisions in\n“institutional reform cases”? What precisely are those\nrules? And when is a case an “institutional reform” case?\nAfter all, as I have tried to show, see supra, at 18–19, the\ncase before us cannot easily be fitted onto the Court’s\nProcrustean “institutional reform” bed.\n   Third, the Court may mean its opinion to express an\nattitude, cautioning judges to take care when the enforce­\nment of federal statutes will impose significant financial\nburdens upon States. An attitude, however, is not a rule\nof law. Nor does any such attitude point towards vacating\nthe Court of Appeals’ opinion here. The record makes\nclear that the District Court did take care. See supra, at\n15. And the Court of Appeals too proceeded with care,\nproducing a detailed opinion that is both true to the record\nand fair to the lower court and to the parties’ submissions\nas well.

The case\nconcerns the rights of Spanish-speaking students, attend­\ning public school near the Mexican border, to learn Eng­\nlish in order to live their lives in a country where English\nis the predominant language.
