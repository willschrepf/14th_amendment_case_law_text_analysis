The Union, JAC, and MTP effectively controlled training opportunities in the ironworkers trade in the St. Louis, Missouri, area.  Before 1964, all ironworkers in St. Louis were white.  In 1964, the federal government and area civil rights organizations began to pressure unions and contractors to increase minority employment opportunities in the construction industry.  Increasingly, blacks sought admission to the ironworkers trade.  In 1964, the JAC first required a high school diploma, or its equivalent, as a prerequisite for entry into the apprentice program.  In 1965, JAC introduced aptitude tests to aid in the selection of apprentices.  During the times relevant to this litigation, applicants to the apprentice program had to satisfy four prerequisites: (1) be between 18-30 years of age, (2) present a doctor's certificate of fitness, (3) be a United States citizen, and (4) have a high school diploma or its equivalent.  Applicants who satisfied these prerequisites, were then rated on the basis of eight selection criteria: (1) physical ability, (2) past experience, (3) references, (4) written examinations, (5) residence, (6) military service, (7) oral interview, and (8) education.  Applicants were admitted to the apprentice program on the basis of their score on these selection criteria.  The four prerequisites should be distinguished from the eight selection criteria because the plaintiffs allege that the effect of the high school diploma prerequisite is discriminatory by itself, the impact of the eight criteria is discriminatory by themselves, and the overall impact of the selection process is discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the Union introduced the minority training program for the purposes of facilitating the entrance of blacks and other minorities into the ironworkers trade.  The MTP was established for persons over the apprenticeable age (usually 30), regardless whether the candidate had a high school diploma.  Trainees during the years 1970-1973 received slightly less pay than apprentices.  The plaintiffs alleged that the separate maintenance of the MTP and apprentice programs and their differential wage rates discriminated against blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule and the class also alleged that the work referral system maintained by the Union discriminated against blacks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand from the first appeal, the district court enjoined the requirement of a high school diploma as a condition for admission to the Ironworkers Apprentice Program.  See Rule v. International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, Local Union No. 396, 471 F.Supp. 1335, 1343 (E.D.Mo.1979).  The court also awarded back pay to those individuals in the MTP from 1970 to 1973 who would have, except for the lack of a high school diploma, been qualified to be selected as an apprentice by the JAC.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The defendants have appealed those rulings.  With minor exceptions, the district court rejected all other class and individual claims.  The plaintiffs have appealed, alleging the trial court erred by (1) failing to find a broad pattern of racial discrimination in the JAC selection criteria, (2) applying incorrect legal standards to assess the JAC admission standards, (3) upholding the referral system, (4) failing to provide an adequate remedy, and (5) denying attorney's fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Although we find the district court was correct in enjoining the use of the high school diploma as a condition of eligibility for selection into the apprentice program, we vacate the judgment below and remand to the district court on the ground that the relief granted is too narrow; we likewise find the district court erred in failing to accord relief to the victims of the discriminatory apprenticeship criteria and failing to award attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>A. Diploma Requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to the defendants' appeal concerning the district court's enjoining the use of the high school diploma as a condition of eligibility for selection to the apprentice program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Donnell v. General Motors Corporation, 576 F.2d 1292 (8th Cir. 1978), this court held that the requirement of a high school education, or its equivalent, as a prerequisite to admission to a skilled trades apprentice program, had a disproportionate impact upon blacks in the St. Louis area.  Id. at 1296-97.  Both Donnell and this case involved a high school diploma prerequisite for a skilled trades apprentice program in an area which includes the St. Louis labor market during the late 1960's and 1970's.  The statistics that were found sufficient to establish a prima facie case in Donnell were introduced in this case.  This evidence showed that 27.9% of the black males over fourteen and 49.1% of white males over fourteen had completed four years of high school in the St. Louis, Missouri-Illinois, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the proceeding on remand in the district court the defendant made no attempt to dispute the plaintiffs' statistics or to show a business necessity for the diploma requirement.  The district court's finding that the high school diploma requirement had a significant disproportionate impact on black applicants to the apprentice program is not clearly erroneous.  See Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 430 n.6, 91 S.Ct. 849, 853, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971); Donnell, 576 F.2d at 1296-97; Pettway v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., 494 F.2d 211, 237 n.60 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1115, 99 S.Ct. 1020, 59 L.Ed.2d 74 (1979); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d 1364, 1370-72 (5th Cir. 1974); United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 918-19 (5th Cir. 1973); Carter v. Gallagher, 3 FEP Cases 692, 700 (D.Minn.), aff'd in part, rev'd in part, 452 F.2d 315 (8th Cir. 1971), rehearing en banc, 452 F.2d 327, cert. denied, 406 U.S. 950, 92 S.Ct. 2045, 32 L.Ed.2d 338 (1972); United States v. Inspiration Consolidated Copper Co., 6 FEP Cases 939, 948-49, 957 (D.Ariz.1973); United States v. Ironworkers, Local 10, 6 FEP Cases 59, 67 (W.D.Mo.1973) (The same ironworker apprenticeship diploma requirement at issue in this case was found to have a disproportionate impact in the Kansas City area).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that the difference in wage rates paid to trainees in the MTP and apprentices in the JAC program was discriminatory.  This holding was premised on a finding that the segregation of blacks into the MTP and whites into the JAC program was due in part to the racially discriminatory diploma requirement for the JAC program.  Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1343.  The district court found that plaintiffs had established a prima facie violation of title VII and that defendants had failed to rebut this showing.  These findings are not clearly erroneous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the plaintiffs' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>B. Apprenticeship Selection Criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applicants who met the apprenticeship eligibility requirements were then rated on the basis of eight criteria: (1) physical ability, (2) past experience, (3) references, (4) written examinations, (5) residence within the geographic jurisdiction of Local No. 396, (6) military service, (7) oral interview, and (8) education.  Applicants whose composite score on these selection criteria was less than 70 were rejected.  Applicants whose composite score was above 70 were eligible for admission.  The JAC would then determine the number of positions for each year's apprenticeship class and fill these positions with applicants who had the highest composite scores.  Plaintiffs contend that the selection criteria had a disproportionate impact upon minorities.  In our previous remand, we directed that \"(t)he apprentice selection process must be viewed as a whole to discover whether there is a disparate racial impact.\" 568 F.2d at 565 n.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This directive was evidently misunderstood by the district court.  First, the district court found that the defendants' use of the diploma eligibility requirement so tainted apprenticeship selection that the overall impact of the selection process was discriminatory.  The district court, however, failed to give any effect to this finding beyond enjoining the diploma requirement. 471 F.Supp. at 1340-41.  The district court then considered whether a single selection criterion-the written aptitude test-had a disproportionate impact on blacks.  Finding that the aptitude tests had no such impact, and ignoring its finding that the eight criteria as a whole had such an impact, the district court denied all class and individual claims for relief based on the overall impact of the discriminatory selection criteria.  The district court's failure to give proper effect to its finding of an overall discriminatory impact requires this court to review plaintiffs' statistical evidence and consider its effect.  The record demonstrates unequivocally that the selection criteria had a disproportionate impact on black applicants who had a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following data on applicants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to the apprentice program were admitted by the defendant during discovery or unchallenged at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII permits employment criteria to be administered to applicants provided that the tests are not \"used\" to discriminate against a group protected by the Act.  Civil Rights Act of 1964, &#167; 703(h), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(h).  Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 329, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2726, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425, 95 S.Ct. 2362, 2375, 45 L.Ed.2d 280 (1975); Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. at 431-32, 91 S.Ct. at 853-854 (1971).  Criteria which disproportionately exclude one racial group are \"used\" to discriminate within the meaning of the Act unless the user can show a business necessity for their use.  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 433-36, 91 S.Ct. at 854-856; Kirby v. Colony Furniture Co., 613 F.2d 696, 702-03 (8th Cir. 1980); Donnell, 576 F.2d at 1299.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the use of selection criteria or tests results in differential pass rates for whites and blacks, the difference could be due to legitimate selection criteria, racially discriminatory selection criteria, or chance.  See, generally D. Baldus &amp; J. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination 288-92 (1980).  If tests of statistical significance eliminate chance as a likely explanation for the differential pass rates, courts will presume that the disparate pass rates are attributable to racially discriminatory selection criteria.  Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 496-97, 97 S.Ct. 1272, 1281-1282, 51 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977); Hazelwood School District v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 308-09 n.14, 97 S.Ct. 2736, 2741-2742, 53 L.Ed.2d 768 (1977).  The defendant can avoid liability under title VII by showing that the differential pass rates were caused by legitimate selection criteria which are justified by business necessity.  Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853; Kirby v. Colony Furniture Co., 613 F.2d 696, 703-04 (8th Cir. 1980).  If the defendant fails to make such a showing, its selection criteria violate title VII.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the actual applicant data shows that the defendants' selection criteria result in disproportionate pass rates.  Ninety-eight per cent of the whites completing the application process scored over 70 on the selection criteria.  Eighty-four per cent of the blacks completing the process scored over 70 on the selection criteria.  The pass rate for whites is computed as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <pre>No. of whites with\ncomposite score over 70       530\n-------------------------  =  ----  =  .98  =  98%\nNo. of whites who             542\ncompleted the application\nprocess\n\tThe pass rate for blacks is computed as follows:\nNo. of Blacks with\ncomposite score over 70        65\n-------------------------  =  ----  =  .84  =  84%\nNo. of Blacks who              77\ncompleted the application\nprocess</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probability that this disproportionate pass rate (.98 of whites v. .84 of blacks) is a result of chance is very small.  The data shows that the defendants' cutoff score of 70 has a statistically significant disproportionate impact on blacks and a prima facie violation of title VII has been made out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The disproportionate impact of the selection criteria is also evident when the proportions of blacks and whites admitted to the apprentice program is considered.  The difference between the number of blacks expected to be accepted as apprentices and the observed number of black admittees is 5.5 standard deviations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  A difference of two or three standard deviations is statistically significant at the five per cent significance level.  See Shoben, Differential Pass-Fail Rates In Employment Testing: Statistical Proof Under Title VII, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 793, 800 (1978).  This significance level has been adopted in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines for test validation.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.14(B)(5).  The difference in this case of 5.5 standard deviations means that it is highly unlikely that the disproportionate apprentice admission rates are due to chance.  Because 69% of the whites (375 of 542) completing the application process were admitted to the apprentice program and only 29% of the blacks (22 of 77), we find that the difference in admission rates is significant in both statistical and practical terms.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D).  The plaintiff has shown, therefore a prima facie violation of title VII.  Once the disproportionate impact was shown, the burden shifted to the defendants to prove the job relatedness of their criteria.  Dothard v.

This testimony is at best inconclusive as to whether either agency seriously evaluated the eight selection criteria.  One of the criteria-the written aptitude test-was submitted to the EEOC and the agency failed to object to its use.  The defendants claim this acquiescence amounts to a prima facie showing of job relatedness.  Administrative inaction, however, seems to be a poor basis for presuming job relatedness of selection criteria.  Nor did the defendant present any evidence as to the standards by which the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training evaluated the written aptitude test or other selection criteria.  There is no evidence that the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training considered the racial impact or job relatedness of the selection criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reliance of Ironworkers Local 396 on the alleged administrative approval in this case seems particularly curious in light of Judge Hunter's rejection of such a defense in United States v. Ironworkers, Local 10, 6 FEP Cases 59, 67 (W.D.Mo.1973).  In that case, the court rejected the union's argument that administrative approval was tantamount to a showing of job relatedness.  Additionally, between the time this case was first tried (April 1975) and the remand (1979), this court established guidelines for validation of employment criteria in Firefighters Institute v. City of St. Louis, 549 F.2d at 509-13.  The defendants failed to conform their proof to any of the validation methods recognized in Firefighters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the original trial and on remand the defendants moved to dismiss at the close of the plaintiffs' evidence.  The district court reserved ruling on both motions.  The defendants should have been made aware of their need to present any of their defenses to plaintiffs' claims at those trials.  Nevertheless, they made no attempt to validate the selection criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To allow the defendants another opportunity to present evidence to validate its selection criteria would drag out an already protracted case, unnecessarily burden the district court and encourage defendants in subsequent cases to refuse to present their title VII defenses in the original trial.  See Hazelwood, 433 U.S. 318-19, 97 S.Ct. 2747 (Stevens, J., dissenting).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, there is no need to remand this case to the district court in order to allow the defendants to attempt to validate their selection criteria.  We find the use of the selection criteria and the requirement of a high school diploma as a condition of eligibility were discriminatory and violated title VII for the period from July 2, 1965 to April 1974.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>C. The Referral System and Letter Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also allege that the district court erred in finding a Letter Agreement signed in 1972 did not create a disproportionate impact on blacks.  We find no error in the court's holding.  In 1972, the Union struck to obtain greater control over referrals of ironworkers to the contractors.  The subsequently negotiated collective bargaining agreement contained a clause, known as the \"Letter Agreement,\" which, for the first time, created a system of priorities for employment referrals.  Rule II, 568 F.2d at 563.  The Letter Agreement gave first preference in referral to \"qualified journeymen,\" defined as union members who had worked at least 6,000 hours in the trade in the Union's territorial jurisdiction.  This policy took effect in August 1972 and continued until November 1973, when the consent decree barred the Union and JAC from applying the 6,000-hour policy to blacks.  Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1341-42.  The priority accorded journeymen in referral is alleged to have had the effect of freezing the status quo of discriminatory employment practices on the theory that blacks admitted to the Union had not had sufficient opportunity to accumulate 6,000 working hours by 1972.  Id. at 1342.  The district court held that the evidence put forth by plaintiffs in support of this theory is insufficient to establish a prima facie case as to the effect of the Letter Agreement for the one year.  Id. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has recognized that referral systems based on the amount of time employees have worked are seniority systems.  United States v. Sheet Metal Workers International Association, Local Union No. 36, 416 F.2d 123, 133 n.20 (8th Cir. 1969).  Seniority systems must be judged under the principles of International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324 (1977) and United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553 (1977).  Teamsters and Evans immunize bona fide seniority systems which have a disproportionate impact on blacks or other minorities, provided that any disparity is not the result of intentional discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 353; Evans, 431 U.S. at 560.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For plaintiffs to prevail on their claim that the referral system violated title VII, proof of discriminatory motive is critical.  The issue in regard to the Letter Agreement is whether plaintiffs have shown facts sufficient to establish an inference of defendants' discriminatory animus in the creation or maintenance of the seniority system in 1972.  The plaintiffs' evidence shows the number of hours of work time accumulated by ironworkers of different races for times after August 1, 1973.  The court is asked to interpolate from this evidence that in 1972, a year for which no evidence was made available, only one black had accumulated the 6,000 work hours necessary to qualify for referral priority and over 200 whites had accumulated the requisite 6,000 hours.  The plaintiffs contend that once this fact is established the plaintiffs have borne their burden of establishing a prima facie showing of defendants' discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A myriad of factors determine how many hours any single ironworker has accumulated and whether an ironworker is even eligible for referral priority.  Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1342 n.5.  Some of these factors include date of entry into the trade, regular work in particular years, willingness to work, aggressiveness in soliciting work outside of the Union's hiring hall, periodic unemployment fluctuations in the trade, geographic proximity to the job, etc.  There was no attempt by plaintiffs to show how a person's race correlated with these other factors to determine referral eligibility.  Moreover, there was almost no evidence offered by plaintiffs to show how the referral policy impacted on blacks, other than to show that blacks were not eligible in proportionate numbers.  Testimony by plaintiffs' and defendants' witnesses indicated that few journeymen relied on the referral program extensively, and the statistics offered by plaintiffs reflect the accumulated hours of many persons who obtain few of their hours through the referral policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs ask this court to infer discriminatory animus for the year 1972 from a set of statistics showing accumulated hours of ironworkers, even though these statistics do not cover the relevant time period, are affected by a number of variables, and fail to show that any black person was actually adversely affected by the referral policy.  The district court's holding that plaintiffs' proof failed to show a prima facie violation of title VII is affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also allege that the referral policy as modified by the consent decree in 1973 violated title VII.  Under the terms of the consent decree, any minority group person who registers for referral is given priority as if he or she had accumulated 6,000 hours of work experience.  Since the original referral system did not violate title VII, it is difficult to see how this modification would.  The district court's holding that the referral policy after 1973 did not violate title VII is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>D.

Injunctive Relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's enjoining the use of the high school diploma as a prerequisite for the apprentice program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of our finding that the JAC selection criteria had a disproportionate impact on blacks, we direct the district court to grant permanent injunctive relief in this regard.  The injunction should prohibit use of all JAC selection criteria until such time as they are proved to be job-related under the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1607.1 to .16.  Walston v. School Board of Suffolk, 566 F.2d 1201, 1204 (4th Cir. 1977); Johnson v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., 491 F.2d at 1373; United States v. Georgia Power Co., 474 F.2d at 917-18.  If the defendant chooses to use a ranking system as part of the selection criteria, this too must be validated under EEOC Guidelines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding that the Union's and JAC's compliance with the affirmative action quotas of the consent decree has led to an increase in black ironworkers, we find it necessary to enjoin the use of the JAC selection criteria until such time as they are proved to be job related.  The consent decree with the Department of Justice required that 45 blacks be admitted as apprentices during the years 1974-1977.  Since the defendants met this quota, the total numbers of admittees to the apprentice program for the years 1965-1978 were 438 white (87% of the total) and 68 blacks (13% of the total).  When these figures are compared with the percentage of blacks in the general population of the St. Louis SMSA (16%) and the percentage of blacks in the general population of the State of Missouri (10%),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> it appears that the apprentice program has achieved a representative number of blacks.  The improvement in the position of blacks in this case, however, is due to the JAC's making exceptions to its usual ranking system for the years 1974-1977 in order to comply with the consent decree.  In 1978, the three year quotas of the consent decree had lapsed and the defendants admitted 29 whites to the apprentice program and no blacks.  In this case, reinstating old practices means that the discriminatory pattern evident for the years 1965-1973 may repeat itself for the years after 1978.  The prospect of future discrimination warrants enjoining the defendants' use of the selection criteria until such time as they are validated under the EEOC Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional reason for such an injunction is that the consent decree ordered that the aptitude tests be validated under the EEOC Guidelines by submitting the tests and a content validity study to the EEOC for analysis.  The tests were submitted to the EEOC but there is no evidence that a content validity study was undertaken or submitted to the EEOC.  The EEOC apparently failed to object to the tests and the defendants continued to use them as part of the selection criteria.  It seems that no validity study has been made of these tests, which have had a disproportionate impact on blacks.  There probably will be no such validation study unless this court enjoins the use of the tests, because the consent decree has expired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

This back pay will be equivalent to the pay of apprentices at that time for actual hours worked in those years.\" 471 F.Supp. at 1343.  The district court's limitation of the class for back pay relief is inadequate for a number of reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  First, MTP membership is irrelevant to the description of persons injured by defendants' discrimination policies and should not limit the class for back pay relief.  Victims of the defendants' discriminatory policies did not automatically enter the MTP. Because MTP applicants had to be over 30 and JAC program applicants had to be under 30, the membership rolls of MTP for the years 1970-1973 included only a few persons who had applied to the apprentice program and were rejected because of the diploma requirement.  Second, the years 1970-1973 mark the years from the start of the MTP until the consent decree, but do not encompass many of the instances of discrimination that occurred before 1970.  The award grants relief only to some victims of the high school diploma requirement and does not accord any relief to those persons who were victims of the discriminatory selection criteria.  Finally, the district court's back pay order allowed no recovery by nonapplicants who could prove that they would have applied had it not been for defendants' discriminatory policies.  Cf. Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 367-68, 97 S.Ct. at 1870-1871.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the appropriate back pay award, there are three issues which should be clarified.  The first is whether back pay should be awarded on an individualized basis or on a classwide basis to be divided among the entire group which the plaintiffs represent.  The second issue requires an estimation of the number of persons who are entitled to back pay relief and the definition of some method to identify the class members who are to receive back pay.  Also, there is an issue of whether the nondiscriminatory admission policies of the defendants during the years 1974-1977 affect the back pay award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) Individual or Classwide Back Pay Relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Where possible, an individualized remedy should be utilized because it will best compensate the victims of discrimination without unfairly penalizing the employer,\" Stewart, 542 F.2d at 452.

Also, persons who can prove that they would have applied for an apprentice position had it not been for the defendants' discriminatory eligibility or selection criteria are members of the class of potential discriminatees.  Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 367-68, 97 S.Ct. at 1870-1871.  This class will include many of the 180 blacks who applied to be an apprentice during the years 1965-April 1974, but were not accepted.  If a black applicant was rejected for a nondiscriminatory reason, that applicant would not be a member of the class of potential discriminatees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine the class of actual discriminatees requires an estimation of the number of apprentice positions that were denied black applicants by reason of the discriminatory policies.  See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 372, 97 S.Ct. at 1873; Wells, 561 F.2d at 1273 (mathematical precision should not be required).  Under a nondiscriminatory selection policy, the proportion of total applicants who were black (202 of 1180; 17%) would approximate roughly the proportion of admittees who would have been black (17% of 397 total admittees = 67 = expected number of black admittees).  The expected number of black admittees (67) exceeds the actual number of black admittees (22) by the difference of 45 persons.  Thus, 45 persons from the class of potential discriminatees constitute the class of actual discriminatees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the size of the class of actual discriminatees is determined, the task for the district court would be to identify which 45 persons would most likely have been selected as apprentices.  The Supreme Court in Teamsters stated that once an alleged discriminatee shows that he or she applied for a position, \"the burden then rests on the employer to demonstrate that the individual applicant was denied an employment opportunity for lawful reasons.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  431 U.S. at 362, 97 S.Ct. at 1868.  Given the apparent complexity and uncertainty of identifying which 45 black applicants are entitled to back pay, a classwide back pay remedy is appropriate.  Stewart, 542 F.2d at 452.  Guidelines for the computation of classwide back pay relief were discussed in Stewart, 542 F.2d at 452-54, and approved by this court in Kirby, 613 F.2d at 705-06, and Wells, 561 F.2d at 1274-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible to determine with a fair degree of exactitude what the loss to the class was as a result of the discriminatory selection process.  Each year from 1965 through 1973 there were a number of apprentice vacancies that blacks were denied because of the discriminatory policies.  The task for the district court on remand is to estimate for each year from 1965 through 1973 the number of apprentice vacancies that were denied blacks.  For this estimation, it should be assumed that under a nondiscriminatory selection process blacks would have been admitted roughly in the same proportion as whites.  For example, if in 1969 there were ten black applicants and 40 white applicants and a total of 15 apprentices admitted, all of which were white, the district court should conclude that three blacks were denied admission by virtue of the discriminatory policies.  The computations are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <pre>                            total        )     (Number of  )     Number of\n(10 black applicants        apprentice   )     (blacks     )     blacks\n--------------------  x 15                  -                 =\n(50 total applicants        positions    )     (admitted   )     discriminatorily\n                            available    )     (that year  )     denied admission.\n                            and filled.\n(10      )\n -- x 15 - 0 = 3.\n(50      )</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>To compute the back pay due for the three black applicants who were hypothetically discriminated against in 1969, the district court shall select three white apprentices admitted in 1969 and compute their aggregate earnings (including benefits) as an apprentice and ironworker from their date of admission in 1969 until the present.  The district court shall subtract from the aggregate income of the three whites the aggregate income (including benefits and amounts earnable with reasonable diligence) of three randomly selected blacks who applied for an apprentice position in 1969 but were rejected.  The difference in the respective earnings of the three white ironworkers and the three rejected black applicants shall be the total value of the back pay damages to the plaintiff class caused by the defendants' discriminatory policies during 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  This back pay sum shall be distributed pro rata among the black applicants rejected in 1969 or in a more equitable manner as determined by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These computations should be performed for each year 1965 through 1973 as they were performed in the hypothetical.  In this way, damages can be computed for the 45 blacks who were discriminatorily denied admission during the years 1965-1973, and these damages distributed among the entire class.  Notice should be sent to the members of the class to afford them an opportunity to claim their damages.  Although there may be no need to encourage those claimants with few interim earnings to file claims, fairness to the Union suggests that persons who had substantial interim earnings should also be brought into the remedial proceeding.  The relative success of these latter persons in obtaining alternative employment suggests that some of them might have been the black applicants who would have been admitted as apprentices.  A more accurate measure of class injury will be obtained if a large number of the rejected applicants are brought into the remedial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Effect of Changed Circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' admission policies from 1974-1977 achieved a racial balance in the apprentice program roughly proportional to that in the general population of St. Louis and Missouri.  Under the \"bottom line\" doctrine of Smith v. Troyan, 520 F.2d 492, 497-98 (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 934, 96 S.Ct. 2646, 49 L.Ed.2d 385 (1976), black applicants who were rejected for the apprentice program during the years 1974-1977 would not be entitled to back pay because the defendants' invalidated selection criteria did not violate title VII during those years.  The affirmative action program under the consent decree does not, however, affect the back pay recovery of black applicants who were denied apprentice positions for discriminatory reasons between July 2, 1965 and April 1974.  The Fifth Circuit in Williams v. DeKalb County, 577 F.2d 248, rev'd on other grounds, 582 F.2d 2 (5th Cir. 1978), held: \"While the existence of the affirmative action program may be considered by the district court on remand in determining whether injunctive relief is appropriate, that program does not affect the availability of back pay as a remedy.\" 577 F.2d at 256.  The issue in this case involves more than the mere availability of back pay relief that was at issue in Williams.  Nevertheless, the defendants' change in policy should not shorten or cap the back pay period for which relief will be granted to pre-1974 discriminatees.  It is the purpose of title VII to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. at 418, 95 S.Ct. at 2372.  To deny pre-1974 discriminatees back pay for the years 1974-1977 because the union subsequently admitted the claimant or some other person to the apprentice program would fail to recompense the discriminatee for his or her total injuries.  To require defendants to pay back pay for 1974-1977 even though the defendant changed its policies during those years is not unfair to the defendants.

Rule I, 423 F.Supp. at 375.  This litigation was commenced on March 14, 1973.  Rule II, 568 F.2d at 561.  There have already been two trials and two appeals.  There will have to be another remand for the remedial stages of this litigation.  The Fifth Circuit in James v. Stockham Valves, supra, determined that an eleven year duration (1966-1977) warranted an interim award of attorney's fees.  This court directs the district court to make an interim award of attorney's fees before the remedial stage of this litigation.  See also Louisville Black Police Officers Organization, Inc. v.

Missouri Pacific R. R., 523 F.2d 1290, 1293-94 (8th Cir. 1975), this court identified three statistical methods of showing a disproportionate impact on minorities.  It seems to be a matter of some debate whether actual applicant data (Green's second method) or general population data (Green's first and third methods) is the preferred statistical measure of disproportionate impact.  Some cases suggest a presumption in favor of actual applicant data.  See New York City Transit Auth. v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 586, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 1366 n.29, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 n.29 (1979); Hester v.

Other cases suggest that general population data can provide a basis for a showing of disproportionate impact even though the actual applicant data would indicate there was no disproportionate impact.  This is particularly the case where there is some threat to the validity of the actual applicant data.  See Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 330, 97 S.Ct. 2720, 2727, 53 L.Ed.2d 786 (1977); Donnell v. General Motors Corp., 576 F.2d 1292, 1298 (8th Cir. 1978).

It appears that this finding was based on the court's application of the disproportionate impact test of Griggs.  However, even if a disproportionate impact had been shown, the seniority system would not have been shown to be a prima facie violation of title VII because Teamsters immunizes seniority systems from attack under the disproportionate impact theories of Griggs.  The plaintiffs' burden in this case under Teamsters was to show facts sufficient to give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  Where, as here, plaintiffs rely solely on statistical evidence of a disproportionate impact on blacks as the basis for inferring discriminatory intent, and offer no other circumstantial or direct evidence of defendants' intent, the plaintiffs' evidence must at a minimum show a disproportionate impact.  And this impact alone would not be determinative of intent, except in unusual circumstances.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.

Members of the MTP during the years 1970-1973 who were victims of the disparate wage rates, however, are entitled to receive back pay regardless whether they \"would have, except for the lack of a high school diploma, or the equivalent, been qualified for admission into J.A.C.\" Accordingly, trainees in the MTP during the years 1970-1973 who received a lower hourly wage rate than their white counterparts in the apprentice program should receive back pay in an amount equal to the difference in the respective hourly rates of apprentices and trainees times the hours worked by trainees during those years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Teamsters involved an award of retroactive seniority, but there are no indications in that case that the burden to prove eligibility for back pay should be on the plaintiffs.

However, this court in Donnell, 576 F.2d at 1301, a case decided after Teamsters, held that to obtain back pay relief a person who was denied an opportunity to complete a company's apprenticeship selection criteria because he lacked a high school diploma would have to prove that \"he can satisfactorily pass the further testing, screening and rating procedures established under ... (the company's) Apprentice Plan.\"  Donnell is not inconsistent with Teamsters because Donnell holds that the employer may require the applicant to complete the valid, nondiscriminatory portions of a selection process in order that the employer have the opportunity to prove that an alleged discriminatee would not have been admitted.  Since in the present case, the defendants have validated none of their selection criteria, these criteria cannot be used to show that a particular applicant would not have been admitted.  Donnell would impose no additional requirements of proof on the present plaintiffs because there are no valid selection criteria in this case and Teamsters would shift the burden to the defendants to prove, if they could, whether particular applicants were rejected for lawful reasons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> For guidance on the method of computing the back pay due, the district court should see Dickerson v.

George Coe made application to the apprentice program in March 1970, but was rejected on the basis of an insufficient composite score on the JAC selection criteria.  Id. Because this court holds that the selection criteria were discriminatory in 1970, Coe is entitled to share in the classwide back pay remedy, unless the district court finds that Coe's rejection to the apprentice program was for a nondiscriminatory reason.  The burden of showing a nondiscriminatory reason for Coe's rejection is on the defendants.  Lonnie Vanderson applied for admission to the apprentice program in October 1974.  Id.

The Union, JAC, and MTP effectively controlled training opportunities in the ironworkers trade in the St. Louis, Missouri, area.  Before 1964, all ironworkers in St. Louis were white.  In 1964, the federal government and area civil rights organizations began to pressure unions and contractors to increase minority employment opportunities in the construction industry.  Increasingly, blacks sought admission to the ironworkers trade.  In 1964, the JAC first required a high school diploma, or its equivalent, as a prerequisite for entry into the apprentice program.  In 1965, JAC introduced aptitude tests to aid in the selection of apprentices.  During the times relevant to this litigation, applicants to the apprentice program had to satisfy four prerequisites: (1) be between 18-30 years of age, (2) present a doctor's certificate of fitness, (3) be a United States citizen, and (4) have a high school diploma or its equivalent.  Applicants who satisfied these prerequisites, were then rated on the basis of eight selection criteria: (1) physical ability, (2) past experience, (3) references, (4) written examinations, (5) residence, (6) military service, (7) oral interview, and (8) education.  Applicants were admitted to the apprentice program on the basis of their score on these selection criteria.  The four prerequisites should be distinguished from the eight selection criteria because the plaintiffs allege that the effect of the high school diploma prerequisite is discriminatory by itself, the impact of the eight criteria is discriminatory by themselves, and the overall impact of the selection process is discriminatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the Union introduced the minority training program for the purposes of facilitating the entrance of blacks and other minorities into the ironworkers trade.  The MTP was established for persons over the apprenticeable age (usually 30), regardless whether the candidate had a high school diploma.  Trainees during the years 1970-1973 received slightly less pay than apprentices.  The plaintiffs alleged that the separate maintenance of the MTP and apprentice programs and their differential wage rates discriminated against blacks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule and the class also alleged that the work referral system maintained by the Union discriminated against blacks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand from the first appeal, the district court enjoined the requirement of a high school diploma as a condition for admission to the Ironworkers Apprentice Program.

With minor exceptions, the district court rejected all other class and individual claims.

Id. at 1296-97.  Both Donnell and this case involved a high school diploma prerequisite for a skilled trades apprentice program in an area which includes the St. Louis labor market during the late 1960's and 1970's.  The statistics that were found sufficient to establish a prima facie case in Donnell were introduced in this case.  This evidence showed that 27.9% of the black males over fourteen and 49.1% of white males over fourteen had completed four years of high school in the St. Louis, Missouri-Illinois, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the proceeding on remand in the district court the defendant made no attempt to dispute the plaintiffs' statistics or to show a business necessity for the diploma requirement.

Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1343.  The district court found that plaintiffs had established a prima facie violation of title VII and that defendants had failed to rebut this showing.

Applicants whose composite score on these selection criteria was less than 70 were rejected.  Applicants whose composite score was above 70 were eligible for admission.  The JAC would then determine the number of positions for each year's apprenticeship class and fill these positions with applicants who had the highest composite scores.  Plaintiffs contend that the selection criteria had a disproportionate impact upon minorities.  In our previous remand, we directed that \"(t)he apprentice selection process must be viewed as a whole to discover whether there is a disparate racial impact.\" 568 F.2d at 565 n.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This directive was evidently misunderstood by the district court.  First, the district court found that the defendants' use of the diploma eligibility requirement so tainted apprenticeship selection that the overall impact of the selection process was discriminatory.  The district court, however, failed to give any effect to this finding beyond enjoining the diploma requirement. 471 F.Supp. at 1340-41.  The district court then considered whether a single selection criterion-the written aptitude test-had a disproportionate impact on blacks.  Finding that the aptitude tests had no such impact, and ignoring its finding that the eight criteria as a whole had such an impact, the district court denied all class and individual claims for relief based on the overall impact of the discriminatory selection criteria.  The district court's failure to give proper effect to its finding of an overall discriminatory impact requires this court to review plaintiffs' statistical evidence and consider its effect.  The record demonstrates unequivocally that the selection criteria had a disproportionate impact on black applicants who had a high school diploma or its equivalent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following data on applicants<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> to the apprentice program were admitted by the defendant during discovery or unchallenged at trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII permits employment criteria to be administered to applicants provided that the tests are not \"used\" to discriminate against a group protected by the Act.

Ninety-eight per cent of the whites completing the application process scored over 70 on the selection criteria.  Eighty-four per cent of the blacks completing the process scored over 70 on the selection criteria.  The pass rate for whites is computed as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <pre>No. of whites with\ncomposite score over 70       530\n-------------------------  =  ----  =  .98  =  98%\nNo. of whites who             542\ncompleted the application\nprocess\n\tThe pass rate for blacks is computed as follows:\nNo. of Blacks with\ncomposite score over 70        65\n-------------------------  =  ----  =  .84  =  84%\nNo. of Blacks who              77\ncompleted the application\nprocess</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probability that this disproportionate pass rate (.98 of whites v. .84 of blacks) is a result of chance is very small.  The data shows that the defendants' cutoff score of 70 has a statistically significant disproportionate impact on blacks and a prima facie violation of title VII has been made out.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The disproportionate impact of the selection criteria is also evident when the proportions of blacks and whites admitted to the apprentice program is considered.  The difference between the number of blacks expected to be accepted as apprentices and the observed number of black admittees is 5.5 standard deviations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  A difference of two or three standard deviations is statistically significant at the five per cent significance level.  See Shoben, Differential Pass-Fail Rates In Employment Testing: Statistical Proof Under Title VII, 91 Harv.L.Rev. 793, 800 (1978).  This significance level has been adopted in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines for test validation.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.14(B)(5).  The difference in this case of 5.5 standard deviations means that it is highly unlikely that the disproportionate apprentice admission rates are due to chance.  Because 69% of the whites (375 of 542) completing the application process were admitted to the apprentice program and only 29% of the blacks (22 of 77), we find that the difference in admission rates is significant in both statistical and practical terms.  See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1607.4(D).  The plaintiff has shown, therefore a prima facie violation of title VII.  Once the disproportionate impact was shown, the burden shifted to the defendants to prove the job relatedness of their criteria.  Dothard v.

This testimony is at best inconclusive as to whether either agency seriously evaluated the eight selection criteria.  One of the criteria-the written aptitude test-was submitted to the EEOC and the agency failed to object to its use.  The defendants claim this acquiescence amounts to a prima facie showing of job relatedness.  Administrative inaction, however, seems to be a poor basis for presuming job relatedness of selection criteria.  Nor did the defendant present any evidence as to the standards by which the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training evaluated the written aptitude test or other selection criteria.  There is no evidence that the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training considered the racial impact or job relatedness of the selection criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reliance of Ironworkers Local 396 on the alleged administrative approval in this case seems particularly curious in light of Judge Hunter's rejection of such a defense in United States v. Ironworkers, Local 10, 6 FEP Cases 59, 67 (W.D.Mo.1973).  In that case, the court rejected the union's argument that administrative approval was tantamount to a showing of job relatedness.  Additionally, between the time this case was first tried (April 1975) and the remand (1979), this court established guidelines for validation of employment criteria in Firefighters Institute v. City of St. Louis, 549 F.2d at 509-13.  The defendants failed to conform their proof to any of the validation methods recognized in Firefighters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the original trial and on remand the defendants moved to dismiss at the close of the plaintiffs' evidence.  The district court reserved ruling on both motions.  The defendants should have been made aware of their need to present any of their defenses to plaintiffs' claims at those trials.  Nevertheless, they made no attempt to validate the selection criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To allow the defendants another opportunity to present evidence to validate its selection criteria would drag out an already protracted case, unnecessarily burden the district court and encourage defendants in subsequent cases to refuse to present their title VII defenses in the original trial.

We find no error in the court's holding.  In 1972, the Union struck to obtain greater control over referrals of ironworkers to the contractors.  The subsequently negotiated collective bargaining agreement contained a clause, known as the \"Letter Agreement,\" which, for the first time, created a system of priorities for employment referrals.  Rule II, 568 F.2d at 563.  The Letter Agreement gave first preference in referral to \"qualified journeymen,\" defined as union members who had worked at least 6,000 hours in the trade in the Union's territorial jurisdiction.  This policy took effect in August 1972 and continued until November 1973, when the consent decree barred the Union and JAC from applying the 6,000-hour policy to blacks.  Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1341-42.  The priority accorded journeymen in referral is alleged to have had the effect of freezing the status quo of discriminatory employment practices on the theory that blacks admitted to the Union had not had sufficient opportunity to accumulate 6,000 working hours by 1972.

The issue in regard to the Letter Agreement is whether plaintiffs have shown facts sufficient to establish an inference of defendants' discriminatory animus in the creation or maintenance of the seniority system in 1972.  The plaintiffs' evidence shows the number of hours of work time accumulated by ironworkers of different races for times after August 1, 1973.  The court is asked to interpolate from this evidence that in 1972, a year for which no evidence was made available, only one black had accumulated the 6,000 work hours necessary to qualify for referral priority and over 200 whites had accumulated the requisite 6,000 hours.  The plaintiffs contend that once this fact is established the plaintiffs have borne their burden of establishing a prima facie showing of defendants' discriminatory intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A myriad of factors determine how many hours any single ironworker has accumulated and whether an ironworker is even eligible for referral priority.  Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1342 n.5.  Some of these factors include date of entry into the trade, regular work in particular years, willingness to work, aggressiveness in soliciting work outside of the Union's hiring hall, periodic unemployment fluctuations in the trade, geographic proximity to the job, etc.  There was no attempt by plaintiffs to show how a person's race correlated with these other factors to determine referral eligibility.  Moreover, there was almost no evidence offered by plaintiffs to show how the referral policy impacted on blacks, other than to show that blacks were not eligible in proportionate numbers.  Testimony by plaintiffs' and defendants' witnesses indicated that few journeymen relied on the referral program extensively, and the statistics offered by plaintiffs reflect the accumulated hours of many persons who obtain few of their hours through the referral policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs ask this court to infer discriminatory animus for the year 1972 from a set of statistics showing accumulated hours of ironworkers, even though these statistics do not cover the relevant time period, are affected by a number of variables, and fail to show that any black person was actually adversely affected by the referral policy.  The district court's holding that plaintiffs' proof failed to show a prima facie violation of title VII is affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs also allege that the referral policy as modified by the consent decree in 1973 violated title VII.  Under the terms of the consent decree, any minority group person who registers for referral is given priority as if he or she had accumulated 6,000 hours of work experience.  Since the original referral system did not violate title VII, it is difficult to see how this modification would.  The district court's holding that the referral policy after 1973 did not violate title VII is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>D.

The consent decree with the Department of Justice required that 45 blacks be admitted as apprentices during the years 1974-1977.  Since the defendants met this quota, the total numbers of admittees to the apprentice program for the years 1965-1978 were 438 white (87% of the total) and 68 blacks (13% of the total).  When these figures are compared with the percentage of blacks in the general population of the St. Louis SMSA (16%) and the percentage of blacks in the general population of the State of Missouri (10%),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> it appears that the apprentice program has achieved a representative number of blacks.  The improvement in the position of blacks in this case, however, is due to the JAC's making exceptions to its usual ranking system for the years 1974-1977 in order to comply with the consent decree.  In 1978, the three year quotas of the consent decree had lapsed and the defendants admitted 29 whites to the apprentice program and no blacks.  In this case, reinstating old practices means that the discriminatory pattern evident for the years 1965-1973 may repeat itself for the years after 1978.  The prospect of future discrimination warrants enjoining the defendants' use of the selection criteria until such time as they are validated under the EEOC Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An additional reason for such an injunction is that the consent decree ordered that the aptitude tests be validated under the EEOC Guidelines by submitting the tests and a content validity study to the EEOC for analysis.  The tests were submitted to the EEOC but there is no evidence that a content validity study was undertaken or submitted to the EEOC.  The EEOC apparently failed to object to the tests and the defendants continued to use them as part of the selection criteria.  It seems that no validity study has been made of these tests, which have had a disproportionate impact on blacks.  There probably will be no such validation study unless this court enjoins the use of the tests, because the consent decree has expired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

This back pay will be equivalent to the pay of apprentices at that time for actual hours worked in those years.\" 471 F.Supp. at 1343.  The district court's limitation of the class for back pay relief is inadequate for a number of reasons.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  First, MTP membership is irrelevant to the description of persons injured by defendants' discrimination policies and should not limit the class for back pay relief.  Victims of the defendants' discriminatory policies did not automatically enter the MTP. Because MTP applicants had to be over 30 and JAC program applicants had to be under 30, the membership rolls of MTP for the years 1970-1973 included only a few persons who had applied to the apprentice program and were rejected because of the diploma requirement.  Second, the years 1970-1973 mark the years from the start of the MTP until the consent decree, but do not encompass many of the instances of discrimination that occurred before 1970.  The award grants relief only to some victims of the high school diploma requirement and does not accord any relief to those persons who were victims of the discriminatory selection criteria.  Finally, the district court's back pay order allowed no recovery by nonapplicants who could prove that they would have applied had it not been for defendants' discriminatory policies.  Cf.

Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 367-68, 97 S.Ct. at 1870-1871.  This class will include many of the 180 blacks who applied to be an apprentice during the years 1965-April 1974, but were not accepted.

See Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 372, 97 S.Ct. at 1873; Wells, 561 F.2d at 1273 (mathematical precision should not be required).  Under a nondiscriminatory selection policy, the proportion of total applicants who were black (202 of 1180; 17%) would approximate roughly the proportion of admittees who would have been black (17% of 397 total admittees = 67 = expected number of black admittees).  The expected number of black admittees (67) exceeds the actual number of black admittees (22) by the difference of 45 persons.

Given the apparent complexity and uncertainty of identifying which 45 black applicants are entitled to back pay, a classwide back pay remedy is appropriate.  Stewart, 542 F.2d at 452.  Guidelines for the computation of classwide back pay relief were discussed in Stewart, 542 F.2d at 452-54, and approved by this court in Kirby, 613 F.2d at 705-06, and Wells, 561 F.2d at 1274-75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible to determine with a fair degree of exactitude what the loss to the class was as a result of the discriminatory selection process.  Each year from 1965 through 1973 there were a number of apprentice vacancies that blacks were denied because of the discriminatory policies.  The task for the district court on remand is to estimate for each year from 1965 through 1973 the number of apprentice vacancies that were denied blacks.  For this estimation, it should be assumed that under a nondiscriminatory selection process blacks would have been admitted roughly in the same proportion as whites.  For example, if in 1969 there were ten black applicants and 40 white applicants and a total of 15 apprentices admitted, all of which were white, the district court should conclude that three blacks were denied admission by virtue of the discriminatory policies.  The computations are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <pre>                            total        )     (Number of  )     Number of\n(10 black applicants        apprentice   )     (blacks     )     blacks\n--------------------  x 15                  -                 =\n(50 total applicants        positions    )     (admitted   )     discriminatorily\n                            available    )     (that year  )     denied admission.\n                            and filled.\n(10      )\n -- x 15 - 0 = 3.\n(50      )</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p>To compute the back pay due for the three black applicants who were hypothetically discriminated against in 1969, the district court shall select three white apprentices admitted in 1969 and compute their aggregate earnings (including benefits) as an apprentice and ironworker from their date of admission in 1969 until the present.  The district court shall subtract from the aggregate income of the three whites the aggregate income (including benefits and amounts earnable with reasonable diligence) of three randomly selected blacks who applied for an apprentice position in 1969 but were rejected.  The difference in the respective earnings of the three white ironworkers and the three rejected black applicants shall be the total value of the back pay damages to the plaintiff class caused by the defendants' discriminatory policies during 1969.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  This back pay sum shall be distributed pro rata among the black applicants rejected in 1969 or in a more equitable manner as determined by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These computations should be performed for each year 1965 through 1973 as they were performed in the hypothetical.  In this way, damages can be computed for the 45 blacks who were discriminatorily denied admission during the years 1965-1973, and these damages distributed among the entire class.  Notice should be sent to the members of the class to afford them an opportunity to claim their damages.  Although there may be no need to encourage those claimants with few interim earnings to file claims, fairness to the Union suggests that persons who had substantial interim earnings should also be brought into the remedial proceeding.  The relative success of these latter persons in obtaining alternative employment suggests that some of them might have been the black applicants who would have been admitted as apprentices.  A more accurate measure of class injury will be obtained if a large number of the rejected applicants are brought into the remedial proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Effect of Changed Circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' admission policies from 1974-1977 achieved a racial balance in the apprentice program roughly proportional to that in the general population of St. Louis and Missouri.

The issue in this case involves more than the mere availability of back pay relief that was at issue in Williams.  Nevertheless, the defendants' change in policy should not shorten or cap the back pay period for which relief will be granted to pre-1974 discriminatees.  It is the purpose of title VII to make persons whole for injuries suffered on account of unlawful employment discrimination.  Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. at 418, 95 S.Ct. at 2372.  To deny pre-1974 discriminatees back pay for the years 1974-1977 because the union subsequently admitted the claimant or some other person to the apprentice program would fail to recompense the discriminatee for his or her total injuries.  To require defendants to pay back pay for 1974-1977 even though the defendant changed its policies during those years is not unfair to the defendants.  The defendants have already benefited from the consent decree modifications of their selection policies because without the consent decree, the number of plaintiffs eligible for back pay would be greater.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the defendants in this case are not employers or companies but are a union local and a joint apprenticeship committee<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> does not mitigate their liability for back pay awards at this stage in the litigation.

Rule I, 423 F.Supp. at 375.  This litigation was commenced on March 14, 1973.  Rule II, 568 F.2d at 561.  There have already been two trials and two appeals.  There will have to be another remand for the remedial stages of this litigation.  The Fifth Circuit in James v. Stockham Valves, supra, determined that an eleven year duration (1966-1977) warranted an interim award of attorney's fees.  This court directs the district court to make an interim award of attorney's fees before the remedial stage of this litigation.  See also Louisville Black Police Officers Organization, Inc. v.

It appears that this finding was based on the court's application of the disproportionate impact test of Griggs.  However, even if a disproportionate impact had been shown, the seniority system would not have been shown to be a prima facie violation of title VII because Teamsters immunizes seniority systems from attack under the disproportionate impact theories of Griggs.  The plaintiffs' burden in this case under Teamsters was to show facts sufficient to give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.  Where, as here, plaintiffs rely solely on statistical evidence of a disproportionate impact on blacks as the basis for inferring discriminatory intent, and offer no other circumstantial or direct evidence of defendants' intent, the plaintiffs' evidence must at a minimum show a disproportionate impact.  And this impact alone would not be determinative of intent, except in unusual circumstances.  See Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.

Members of the MTP during the years 1970-1973 who were victims of the disparate wage rates, however, are entitled to receive back pay regardless whether they \"would have, except for the lack of a high school diploma, or the equivalent, been qualified for admission into J.A.C.\" Accordingly, trainees in the MTP during the years 1970-1973 who received a lower hourly wage rate than their white counterparts in the apprentice program should receive back pay in an amount equal to the difference in the respective hourly rates of apprentices and trainees times the hours worked by trainees during those years</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn17\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17_ref\">17</a>\n        <p> Teamsters involved an award of retroactive seniority, but there are no indications in that case that the burden to prove eligibility for back pay should be on the plaintiffs.  Thus, Teamsters, places the burden of proving which persons in the present case are not entitled to back pay on the defendants.  However, this court in Donnell, 576 F.2d at 1301, a case decided after Teamsters, held that to obtain back pay relief a person who was denied an opportunity to complete a company's apprenticeship selection criteria because he lacked a high school diploma would have to prove that \"he can satisfactorily pass the further testing, screening and rating procedures established under ... (the company's) Apprentice Plan.\"  Donnell is not inconsistent with Teamsters because Donnell holds that the employer may require the applicant to complete the valid, nondiscriminatory portions of a selection process in order that the employer have the opportunity to prove that an alleged discriminatee would not have been admitted.  Since in the present case, the defendants have validated none of their selection criteria, these criteria cannot be used to show that a particular applicant would not have been admitted.  Donnell would impose no additional requirements of proof on the present plaintiffs because there are no valid selection criteria in this case and Teamsters would shift the burden to the defendants to prove, if they could, whether particular applicants were rejected for lawful reasons</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn18\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18_ref\">18</a>\n        <p> For guidance on the method of computing the back pay due, the district court should see Dickerson v.

Rule III, 471 F.Supp. at 1341.  Hameed's claim that he was a victim of the high school diploma requirement was rejected because the court found he was offered admission into the apprentice program and he declined.  Hameed first applied to the apprentice program in 1966.  Rule I, 423 F.Supp. at 375.  Hameed was offered admission to the apprentice program sometime after July 1972.  Id. at 376.  As a rejected applicant to the apprentice program, Hameed would be entitled to share in the classwide back pay remedy, unless the Union or JAC can show that Hameed was not offered admission until 1972 because of a nondiscriminatory reason.  George Coe made application to the apprentice program in March 1970, but was rejected on the basis of an insufficient composite score on the JAC selection criteria.  Id. Because this court holds that the selection criteria were discriminatory in 1970, Coe is entitled to share in the classwide back pay remedy, unless the district court finds that Coe's rejection to the apprentice program was for a nondiscriminatory reason.  The burden of showing a nondiscriminatory reason for Coe's rejection is on the defendants.  Lonnie Vanderson applied for admission to the apprentice program in October 1974.  Id.
