Plaintiff J.T., on\n\nbehalf of herself, her minor son A.T., and all Dumont students\n\nsimilarly   situated,   appeals   from       the   Chancery    Division     order\n\ngranting summary judgment in favor of defendants.                    Plaintiffs\n\nallege that defendants failed to accommodate the putative class 1\n\nmembers' disabilities in violation of the LAD by refusing to\n\n1\n  The complaint defines the putative class as all \"kindergarten\nstudents in the District, or who may be kindergarten students in\nthe District in the future, [who] are classified as requiring\nspecial education services, or who may be so classified in the\nfuture, and [who] reside within the town of Dumont.\" This class\nconsisted of at least ninety-six students.        The complaint\nalleged that A.T.'s claims are \"typical of those of the [c]lass\nas a whole.\"\n\n\n\n                                       2                                 A-2424-12T1\n\fprovide the special education services that the special needs\n\nstudents require in their neighborhood schools.                            Defendants are\n\nthe Dumont school district, the Board of Education, the district\n\nsuperintendent, and the director of special services.                                 Because\n\nplaintiffs did not demonstrate they were deprived of a benefit\n\ndue   to   a    disability      and     thus       failed    to   make    a    prima     facie\n\nshowing of disability discrimination under the LAD, we affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       The record reveals that J.T. and her minor son A.T. resided\n\nin    Dumont,    a    town     of   about      two    square      miles.        The    school\n\ndistrict of Dumont has four elementary schools: Selzer, Grant,\n\nHoniss, and Lincoln.            In both the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school\n\nyears,     about      180    students     attended          kindergarten        within      the\n\ndistrict.       The school district's policy provided that generally\n\nchildren       were     to    attend     their        neighborhood        schools.            An\n\nexception      to     the    policy    was     when    the    child's      Individualized\n\nEducation Plan (IEP) required special education services that\n\nwere provided in a different school.\n\n       Beginning       in     the     2008-2009       school      year,       the   district\n\noffered an inclusion kindergarten class in addition to a self-\n\ncontained kindergarten class.                  The self-contained classroom had\n\nonly children whose needs, according to their IEPs, warranted a\n\nfull-time special education teacher.                        The inclusion classroom,\n\n\n\n\n                                               3                                      A-2424-12T1\n\fon   the    other     hand,   had   both       general     education      and    special\n\neducation students who were taught the regular curriculum by a\n\nfull-time      general        education        teacher      with     the      part-time\n\nassistance of a special education teacher.                    The amount of time\n\nthat    the   special     education       teacher    spent     in       the   inclusion\n\nclassroom varied according to the combined requirements of the\n\nchildren's IEPs.         Both the inclusion and self-contained classes\n\nwere located in the same school building each year.\n\n       In each of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years, four\n\nspecial needs children were placed in the inclusion kindergarten\n\nclassroom as required by their IEPs.2                    In the 2010-2011 school\n\nyear, only one student with disabilities was in the inclusion\n\nclass.      Each year during this same period, depending on their\n\nindividual     educational       needs     as     determined       by    their      IEPs,\n\nseveral     special    education    children        were    placed      in    the   self-\n\ncontained kindergarten classroom, in out-of-district placements,\n\nor     in   regular    kindergartens       in     their     neighborhood         schools\n\nbecause they needed only support services, not special education\n\nteachers, to carry out their IEPs.3\n\n\n2\n  Inclusion classrooms may contain up to eight students with\nspecial needs. N.J.A.C. 6A:14-4.6(n).\n3\n  At least one child was in a regular education classroom without\nspecial services because his parents declined the inclusion\nplacement in favor of placement in the neighborhood school\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                           4                                    A-2424-12T1\n\f      When    A.T.     was   three    years   old,    he    was     diagnosed     with\n\nchildhood autism, a pervasive developmental disorder.                         In the\n\n2008-2009     school     year,     pursuant   to     his    IEP,    A.T.     attended\n\npreschool in the district's inclusion classroom in Selzer, his\n\nneighborhood school, for half the day and spent the remainder of\n\nthe day in an out-of-district self-contained program.\n\n      In May 2009, the district personnel and J.T. met to discuss\n\nA.T.'s IEP for his upcoming kindergarten year.                       J.T. and the\n\ndistrict      agreed     that      A.T.   needed     some       special     education\n\nservices.      The district personnel proposed moving him from a\n\nself-contained class to the district's inclusion class, to be\n\nheld in Grant.          The inclusion class was taught by a regular\n\neducation teacher who followed a regular education curriculum.\n\nThe   class    also    had    fewer   students     than     a    regular    education\n\nkindergarten     class       and   provided   services          according    to   each\n\nspecial education student's IEP with the assistance of a part-\n\ntime special education teacher.\n\n      In contrast, J.T. wanted A.T. to attend a general education\n\nclassroom at his home school, Selzer, with the supports provided\n\nin that classroom.           The district personnel did not think this\n\noption met A.T.'s special needs; rather, they reasoned that A.T.\n\n\n(continued)\nwithout a special education teacher's services.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5                                  A-2424-12T1\n\fneeded the integrated services, smaller class size, and in-class\n\nspecial       education    teacher     to       enable     A.T.    to    retain    and\n\ngeneralize information in order to meet the goal of readying him\n\nfor a regular education classroom for the next year.                        Although\n\nJ.T. did not agree, the final IEP designated A.T.'s educational\n\nplacement as the inclusion kindergarten class at Grant.\n\n      In June 2009, J.T. filed a due process petition with the\n\nNew      Jersey        Department      of       Education         challenging      the\n\nappropriateness of the IEP's inclusion placement at Grant rather\n\nthan a regular education placement at Selzer.                           In September\n\n2009, A.T. began attending the inclusion kindergarten class at\n\nGrant.        Shortly thereafter, on September 28, 2009, plaintiffs\n\nfiled     a    class    action   complaint        in     federal    court   alleging\n\nviolations of (1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n\nAct (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A. §§ 1400-1485, based on the district's\n\nfailure       to   educate       children       in     the    least      restrictive\n\nenvironment, (2) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29\n\nU.S.C.A. § 794, due to discrimination against class members, and\n\n(3) the LAD for failing to accommodate class members in their\n\nneighborhood       school.       In   November       2009,   plaintiffs     withdrew\n\ntheir due process petition.\n\n      While the federal litigation was pending, A.T. completed\n\nhis kindergarten year in the inclusion class.                       The parties do\n\n\n\n\n                                            6                                A-2424-12T1\n\fnot dispute that A.T. benefitted educationally, emotionally, and\n\nsocially from the inclusion placement.                        For his first        grade\n\nyear, the parents and district                    personnel agreed that it was\n\nappropriate to place him in the regular education classroom in\n\nSelzer with some special education services.\n\n       After completion of discovery in federal court, both sides\n\nmoved for summary judgment.                 The district court granted summary\n\njudgment      in    favor     of    defendants     on   the   IDEA   and   RA   claims,\n\nfinding a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there was\n\nno legally cognizable injury and plaintiffs failed to exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies.                  The court noted that \"plaintiffs are\n\nalso    not        claiming        that    A.T.    suffered     a    deprivation       of\n\neducational benefits.                Thus, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated\n\neither 'a loss of educational opportunity for the student,' or a\n\nserious deprivation of the parents' 'participation rights,' or a\n\n'deprivation of educational benefits . . . .'\"                       J.T. v. Dumont\n\nPub. Schs., No. 09-4969 (MAH), 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42671, at\n\n*34-35 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2012) (internal citations omitted).\n\n       In finding that plaintiffs failed to establish a concrete\n\nand particularized harm, the court reasoned:\n\n              Plaintiffs may not establish their standing\n              based solely on the argument that Dumont\n              committed a procedural violation by failing\n              to consider whether the exact same services\n              should be provided in a child's neighborhood\n              school.   Crucially, Plaintiffs have failed\n\n\n\n                                              7                                 A-2424-12T1\n\f           to   identify,  or   they  have  abandoned,\n           assertions that Dumont's policy resulted in\n           the loss of an educational opportunity,\n           seriously deprived parents of participation\n           rights, or deprived students of educational\n           benefits.\n\n           [Id. at *42.]\n\n    The court also found that plaintiffs' voluntary failure to\n\npursue    their     administrative      remedies    was   fatal       to      their\n\ncomplaint.     According to the court, \"[t]he evidence does not\n\nsupport Plaintiffs' claim that Dumont used the inclusion class\n\nto systematically avoid the IDEA's requirement to individually\n\nconsider students' needs when making placement decisions.\"                       Id.\n\nat *54.      On the issue of whether the placement was the least\n\nrestrictive environment, the court pointed out that plaintiffs\n\nand any kindergartener affected by an inclusion placement, \"can\n\n[and must] seek redress on this substantive claim through the\n\nadministrative process.\"          Id. at *55.\n\n    Addressing       plaintiffs'     claim   that   placement    in   the      non-\n\nneighborhood school was a violation of the RA, the court found\n\nthat \"[f]or the same reasons Plaintiffs have failed to show that\n\nthey suffered an injury under the IDEA, Plaintiffs have failed\n\nto establish that J.T. has been discriminated against due to his\n\ndisability.\"        Id. at *58.      The court specifically found that\n\nplaintiffs'    RA    claim   of   discrimination    due   to    not   attending\n\none's neighborhood school was based upon the same facts as their\n\n\n\n                                       8                                   A-2424-12T1\n\fIDEA claim.      Ibid.      Having dismissed the federal claims for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction, the district court declined to\n\nexercise     supplemental          jurisdiction        over      the    LAD   claims    and\n\ndismissed them without prejudice.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       Shortly      after    the    dismissal        of    the    federal      complaint,\n\nplaintiffs filed a civil complaint in the Chancery Division.\n\nThe    complaint     alleged       violations     of      the    LAD,    including     that\n\ndefendants discriminated against the putative class members due\n\nto their disabilities by (1) forcing them to receive required\n\nspecial      education      services       in    a     school      other      than    their\n\nneighborhood school, (2) failing to consider the placements or\n\nthe provision of transportation on an individual basis, and (3)\n\nsegregating class members due to their special education needs.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants had failed to\n\nobey   the    LAD    and    asked    for   an    order     requiring,         among   other\n\nrelief, that all class members be educated in their neighborhood\n\nschool whenever possible, an in-class special education teacher\n\nbe furnished in each of the class members' neighborhood school,\n\nand a court-appointed Special Master paid for by the district to\n\nreview all IEPs and determine defendants' compliance with these\n\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9                                     A-2424-12T1\n\f      After agreeing to rely on the discovery obtained in the\n\nfederal case, the parties moved for partial summary judgment as\n\nto   liability       under    the    LAD.           In    analyzing       plaintiffs'         LAD\n\ndisability      accommodation             claim,         the    judge     found        it    was\n\nundisputed     that     A.T.    had       a    disability        and     that    the    school\n\ndistrict       was     an      entity          required          to     make      reasonable\n\naccommodations unless the school district demonstrated that such\n\naccommodations would impose an undue burden to its operation.\n\nN.J.A.C. 13:13-4.11.           Employing the standard from the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213, the\n\njudge found that to state a claim for failure to accommodate, a\n\nplaintiff must show that he or she (1) has a disability; (2) is\n\notherwise qualified to participate in a program; and (3) was\n\ndenied   the    benefits       of   the       program      or    discriminated         against\n\nbecause of the disability.\n\n      The   judge     noted     that      under      the       IDEA,    centralization        of\n\nprograms was lawful and determined that plaintiffs failed to\n\nshow that the centralization of the program deprived them of a\n\nbenefit.       Based     upon       the       circumstances           present,    the       judge\n\nreasoned     that     program       accessibility,              rather     than     facility\n\naccessibility, was key to the implementation of the ADA, and by\n\nimplication the LAD.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10                                      A-2424-12T1\n\f    The judge found that plaintiffs established the first two\n\nelements but did not show that the district deprived A.T. of a\n\ncognizable benefit or program due to a disability.                           \"To the\n\ncontrary,     the     [p]laintiffs        received         all     the      necessary\n\neducational    benefits,       programs       and    extracurricular        resources\n\nrequired under the law.\"              Although the judge recognized that\n\nthere was a pedagogical benefit to attending one's neighborhood\n\nschool, \"all other things being equal,\" he emphasized that A.T.\n\nthrived in his kindergarten class, educationally and socially,\n\nand that there was no evidence that A.T. or any of the putative\n\nclass   members     suffered    actual    harm       by   not    attending    his   or\n\nneighborhood school or by being bused to school.                      Accordingly,\n\nthe judge dismissed the complaint.              This appeal followed.\n\n    While this appeal was pending, the Third Circuit upheld the\n\ndistrict    court's    decision    dismissing         plaintiffs     IDEA     and   RA\n\nclaims on April 26, 2013.          J.T. v. Dumont Pub. Schs., 533 Fed.\n\nApp'x 44, 55 (3d Cir. 2013).           The circuit court emphasized that\n\n\"IDEA permits schools to provide special education services in a\n\ncentralized location.\"         Id. at 49.           The circuit court concurred\n\nthat there was no substantive harm shown to A.T. or any of the\n\nputative class members          as there was \"no denial of services,\n\nopportunities, participation, or benefits.\"                      Id. at 50.         The\n\ncircuit    court    also   rejected    plaintiffs'         claim    under    the    RA,\n\n\n\n\n                                         11                                  A-2424-12T1\n\freasoning that \"when [RA] claims are based on violations of the\n\nIDEA, the [RA] claims are derivative of the IDEA claims.\"                          Id.\n\nat 52 (internal citations omitted).\n\n      In    addition,        the     circuit     court    explicitly        rejected\n\nplaintiffs' claim that they suffered additional injury under the\n\nRA because they were bused out of their neighborhood and located\n\nin a different part of the school from the regular education\n\nclassrooms, thus marking them as disabled in the eyes of their\n\npeers.      Ibid.    The court found that Doe v. National Board of\n\nMedical Examiners, 199 F.3d. 146, 153 (3d Cir. 1999), which held\n\nthat under certain circumstances, merely identifying a person as\n\ndisabled     can    be   a    violation    of     the    RA,    did   not     support\n\nplaintiffs' RA claims.             J.T., supra, 533 Fed. App'x at 52.              The\n\ncourt found that busing students in compliance with their IEPs\n\nwas   not    such   a    circumstance,         stating   \"[i]n    contrast,      IDEA\n\nrequires school districts to identify students in need in order\n\nto provide them special education services.                    Busing students to\n\na centralized location for special services may be integral to\n\nIDEA compliance and, depending on the IEP, is sought by many\n\nparents     of   children     with     special    needs.\"        Ibid.      (internal\n\ncitations omitted).          The court also stressed that \"the procedure\n\nthrough which the school district placed A.T. in the inclusion\n\n\n\n\n                                          12                                 A-2424-12T1\n\fclass   is    not   rendered    a     systemic      issue        simply    because     J.T.\n\nraises it in a putative class action.\"4                 Id. at 54.\n\n                                        III.\n\n     On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial judge erred in\n\nholding that they failed to establish a prima facie case under\n\nthe LAD for disability discrimination.                      Plaintiffs contend that\n\nattending     one's    neighborhood        school      is    a    cognizable      benefit\n\nprotected      under   the     LAD,     and     that        the    judge    incorrectly\n\ndistinguished       between    program      and     facility        accessibility        in\n\nanalyzing the benefit.              Further, plaintiffs contend that the\n\njudge's      determination     that     plaintiffs          provided       no   proof     of\n\nactual harm was erroneous because plaintiffs' expert's report\n\ndescribed such harm.\n\n     Amici, consisting of several non-profit organizations that\n\nadvocate for the rights of children with disabilities, support\n\nplaintiffs'     arguments.          They   submit      that       studies       show   that\n\nchildren with disabilities benefit more from being in regular\n\neducation     classrooms      with    regular     education         students,      rather\n\n\n4\n   In   considering   J.T.'s   failure  to   exhaust  the   IDEA\nadministrative remedies, the court observed that while J.T.\nframed the complaint as an overall challenge to a general school\npolicy, the determination of the effect of any district policy\non each IEP entailed a factually-intensive inquiry, which the\nIDEA administrative process was designed to address, noting\nthat\"[t]his claim addresses only one component of the school\ndistrict's educational program . . . .\" Id. at 54.\n\n\n\n                                           13                                     A-2424-12T1\n\fthan being segregated in special education classes with only\n\ndisabled    students.     They     also    contend    that   children    are\n\nstigmatized as different by having to take a small school bus to\n\ntheir programs.    Amici further argue that the school district's\n\npolicy of centralizing the inclusion kindergarten class denied\n\nthe putative class members of benefits they would have enjoyed\n\nif they had attended integrated classrooms in their neighborhood\n\nschools.\n\n    Defendants maintain that no LAD violation occurred because\n\nunder the IDEA and state law, a school district has discretion\n\nin determining the location and type of services that a child\n\nneeds to receive an appropriate education in accordance with the\n\nchild's    IEP.   They   also    argue    that   because   plaintiffs'   LAD\n\nclaims are based upon the same core facts as their IDEA claims,\n\nthe LAD claims are derivative of the IDEA claims and fail for\n\nthe same reasons as the IDEA and the RA claims.                 Defendants\n\nfurther contend that plaintiffs failed to establish that A.T.\n\nwas deprived of a benefit or, in the alternative, submit that\n\nthe IEPs were a reasonable accommodation based upon each child's\n\nindividual disability.      Finally, defendants urge us to affirm\n\nthe trial court's decision because the record does not contain\n\nany proof of actual harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                    14                             A-2424-12T1\n\f       We begin with a review of the applicable legal principles\n\nthat   guide    our     analysis.          We    first    address    the   federal     law\n\nconcerning education of children with disabilities.                          \"Although\n\neducation      is     primarily        a        concern    of      state   and      local\n\ngovernments,\"       education         of    children       with     disabilities       \"is\n\nregulated by a complex scheme of federal and state statutes and\n\nadministrative regulations.\"                Lascari v. Bd. of Educ., 116 N.J.\n\n30,    33   (1989).       The    IDEA       ensures       that    all   children     with\n\ndisabilities5 have available to them a free appropriate public\n\neducation      (FAPE)    in     the    least         restrictive    environment       that\n\nprovides special education and related services to meet their\n\nunique needs and prepare them for further education, employment,\n\nand independent living, and ensures that the rights of such\n\nchildren and their parents are protected.                         See 20 U.S.C.A. §§\n\n1400(d)(1)(A),(B).         New Jersey has adopted a statute, N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:46-1 to -55, and regulations, N.J.A.C. 6A:14-1.1 to -9.2, to\n\ncomply with the extensive goals and procedures established in\n\nthe IDEA in order to receive significant federal funding.                              See\n\n20 U.S.C.A. § 1412.\n\n\n5\n  A \"child with a disability\" includes children with intellectual\ndisabilities, speech and language impairments, serious emotional\ndisturbance, and specific learning disabilities, who, by reason\nthereof, need special education and related services.          20\nU.S.C.A. § 1401(30)(A).\n\n\n\n\n                                                15                               A-2424-12T1\n\f          Central to the IDEA and the provision of a FAPE is the IEP,\n\na comprehensive written plan developed by a team consisting of\n\nthe       student's   parents,    teachers,         and   representatives         of    the\n\nlocal educational agency.6             20 U.S.C.A. § 1414(d).                The IEP's\n\nultimate purpose is to tailor the educational services in order\n\nto    meet     the    special     needs       resulting       from    the     student's\n\ndisability and to ensure that the student receives the benefits\n\nof    a    FAPE.      20   U.S.C.A.    §§     1412(a)(1),      (4).        The    IEP   is\n\ngenerally      developed     each     year    by    the    entire    IEP    team.       20\n\nU.S.C.A. §§ 1414(d)(2), (4).                Regarding the development of this\n\nimportant       comprehensive       plan,     the    IDEA     accords      \"significant\n\ndeference to the choices made by school officials as to what\n\nconstitutes an appropriate program for each student.\"                              Ridley\n\nSch. Dist. v. M.R., 680 F.3d 260, 277 (3d Cir. 2012).\n\n          The IDEA mandates that, to the maximum extent possible,\n\nchildren       with   disabilities         must     be    educated    in    the     least\n\nrestrictive        environment.       20     U.S.C.A.     §   1412(a)(5);        N.J.A.C.\n\n\n6\n  Under the New Jersey Administrative Code, an IEP is defined as\n\"a written plan which sets forth present levels of academic\nachievement and functional performance, measurable annual goals\nand short-term objectives or benchmarks . . . .\"        N.J.A.C.\n6A:14-1.3.   It refers to an \"integrated, sequential program of\nindividually designed instructional activities and related\nservices necessary to achieve the stated goals and objectives.\nThis plan shall establish the rationale for the student's\neducational placement[] [and] serve as the basis for program\nimplementation. . . .\" Ibid.\n\n\n\n                                             16                                  A-2424-12T1\n\f6A:14-1.1(b)(5).       This environment is one that, to the greatest\n\nextent    possible,     educates     disabled    children      together   with\n\nchildren who are not disabled in the same school the disabled\n\nchild would attend if the child was not disabled.               20 U.S.C.A. §\n\n1412(a)(5); N.J.A.C. 6A:14-4.2.            Specifically, \"[u]nless the IEP\n\nof a child with a disability requires some other arrangement,\n\nthe child is educated in the school that he or she would attend\n\nif nondisabled.\"       Murray v. Montrose Cnty. Sch. Dist., 51 F.3d.\n\n921, 929 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 909, 116 S. Ct.\n\n278, 133 L. Ed. 2d 198 (1995) (internal citations omitted); see\n\nalso     N.J.A.C.   6A:14-14.2(a)(7).           The    Third    Circuit    has\n\ninterpreted this to require that a disabled child be placed in\n\nthe least restrictive environment that will provide the child\n\nwith a \"meaningful educational benefit.\"              T.R. v. Kingwood Twp.\n\nBd. of Educ., 205 F.3d 572, 578 (3d Cir. 2000).                 Additionally,\n\nin the Third Circuit, there is a presumption in favor of placing\n\nthe child in the neighborhood school if possible.               See Oberti v.\n\nBd. of Educ., 995 F.2d 1204, 1224 n.31 (3d Cir. 1993).\n\n       Nevertheless,    the   IDEA     does     not   impose    an   absolute\n\nobligation to place a child in his or her neighborhood school;\n\nrather, the school district is required to take into account\n\ngeographical proximity of placement.

School\n\ndistricts      are        permitted      to    centralize           services    and     the\n\npreference for neighborhood schooling is one of many factors\n\nwhich the school district is entitled to consider.                         See Barnett,\n\nsupra, 927 F.2d at 153.               Further, the school district is not\n\nrequired to move a program or service to a child's neighborhood\n\nschool.      See Kevin G. v.

They can request\n\na due process hearing,8 which in New Jersey entails a full-\n\nfledged     adjudicatory    hearing        at   the   Office   of   Administrative\n\nLaw,   or   they   can    file   an   administrative       complaint       with     the\n\ndesignated state education agency, which must investigate and\n\nissue a decision within sixty days.               See 34 C.F.R. § 300.152.             A\n\nparty aggrieved by the decision may bring an appeal from the\n\nadministrative     proceedings        in    any   state   or     federal   district\n\ncourt regardless of the amount in controversy.                      20 U.S.C.A. §\n\n1415(i)(2)(A).           Generally,        plaintiffs     must      exhaust      these\n\nadministrative remedies before seeking relief under the IDEA as\n\nwell as under several other federal laws:\n\n             Nothing in this title [20 U.S.C.A. §§ 1400\n             et seq.] shall be construed to restrict or\n             limit the rights, procedures, and remedies\n             available   under   the   Constitution,  the\n             Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n             title V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973\n             [29 U.S.C.A. §§ 790 et seq.], or other\n             Federal   laws  protecting   the  rights  of\n             children with disabilities, except that\n\n8\n  At a due process hearing, the student may bring complaints\nunder the IDEA \"with respect to any matter relating to the\nidentification, evaluation, or educational placement of the\nchild, or the provision of a [FAPE] to such child[.]\"     20\nU.S.C.A. § 1415(b)(6)(A).\n\n\n\n                                           19                                 A-2424-12T1\n\f            before the filing of a civil action under\n            such laws seeking relief that is also\n            available under this part [20 U.S.C.A. §§\n            1411   et   seq.],   the   procedures   under\n            subsections (f) and (g) shall be exhausted\n            to the same extent as would be required had\n            the action been brought under this part.\n\n            [20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(l).]\n\n    Thus, to the extent that any federal action seeks relief\n\nthat is available under the IDEA, the administrative procedures\n\nin the IDEA must first be exhausted.                    N.J. Prot. & Advocacy,\n\nInc. v. N.J. Dep't of Educ., 563 F. Supp. 2d 474, 484 (D.N.J.\n\n2008).

Further, \"[t]his provision bars\n\nplaintiffs from circumventing IDEA's exhaustion requirement by\n\ntaking    claims   that     could    have       been   brought   under     IDEA   and\n\nrepackaging them as claims under some other statute\" such as the\n\nRA and the ADA.      Jeremy H. v. Mount Lebanon Sch.

The RA provides that anyone receiving\n\nfederal      funds    may       not     discriminate      against      an    \"otherwise\n\nqualified individual with a disability . . . .\"                         29 U.S.C.A. §\n\n794(a).      The education regulations promulgated under Section 504\n\nof the RA generally conform to the standards established in the\n\nIDEA.      See 34 C.F.R. §§ 104.31 to -39.               Indeed, the IDEA and the\n\nRA are \"built around fundamental notions of equal access to\n\nstate   programs       and       facilities\"      and    thus   \"their      substantive\n\nrequirements      .    .    .    have     been    interpreted    to    be   strikingly\n\nsimilar.\"      Smith v.

Ed. 2d 746, 768 (1984), superseded on other\n\ngrounds by 20 U.S.C.A. 1415(i)(3)(B).\n\n      Comparable to the RA, the ADA protects against disability\n\ndiscrimination by providing that \"no qualified individual with a\n\ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from\n\nparticipation in or be denied                    the benefits of the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination by any such entity.\"                     42 U.S.C.A. § 12132.          The\n\nADA regulations generally conform to the regulations promulgated\n\n\n\n\n                                             21                                A-2424-12T1\n\funder Section 504 of the RA.

See CG, supra, 734 F.3d at\n\n235; Taylor, supra, 737 F. Supp. 2d at 487-88; Hornstine v. Twp.\n\nOf Moorestown, 263 F. Supp. 2d 887, 901 (D.N.J. 2003).\n\n    While the IDEA concerns the affirmative duty to provide a\n\npublic    education     to    disabled     students,        the   RA    and    the      ADA\n\n\"embody    the   negative      prohibition      against       depriving        disabled\n\nstudents   of    public      education.\"       CG,    supra,      734   F.3d       at   234\n\n(citing W.B. v Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 492-93 (3d Cir. 1995)).\n\nHence, the IDEA provides a remedy for \"inappropriate educational\n\nplacement decisions, regardless of discrimination,\" while the\n\nADA and the RA prohibit and provide a remedy for discrimination.\n\nIbid.    (citing      Hornstine,   supra,      263     F.    Supp.      2d    at    901).\n\nGenerally, failure to provide a FAPE violates the IDEA as well\n\nas the ADA and the RA9 \"because it deprives disabled students of\n\na benefit that non-disabled students receive simply by attending\n\nschool    in    the   normal    course     —   a     free,    appropriate          public\n\neducation.\"      Id. at 235.        Conversely, the provision of a FAPE\n\ngenerally rules out discrimination claims under the RA and the\n\nADA for benefits available under the IDEA.                     See, e.g., Miller,\n\n\n\n\n9\n  We recognize that as the definition of disability is different\nunder the IDEA and the RA, violation of the IDEA is not evidence\nof a per se violation of the RA.

In    New\n\nJersey,    persons      with     disabilities           are     protected        from\n\ndiscrimination by the LAD.           N.J.S.A. 10:5-4.          In relevant part,\n\nthe LAD provides:\n\n          All persons shall have the opportunity to\n          obtain . . .      all the accommodations,\n          advantages, facilities, and privileges of\n          any place of public accommodation . . .\n          without discrimination because of . . .\n          disability . . . .     This opportunity is\n          recognized as and declared to be a civil\n          right.\n\n          [N.J.S.A. 10:5-4.]\n\n\"A place of public accommodation\" includes \"any kindergarten,\n\nprimary and secondary school[.]\"                N.J.S.A. 10:5-5(l).\n\n    Our courts broadly interpret the LAD to further its purpose\n\n\"to eradicate the 'cancer of discrimination[.]'\"                       Ellison v.\n\nCreative Learning Ctr., 383 N.J. Super. 581, 588 (App. Div.\n\n2006) (internal citations omitted).                The regulations implemented\n\nin furtherance of the LAD similarly provide that \"the remedial\n\nprovisions of the statute will be given a broad construction and\n\nits exceptions construed narrowly.\"                N.J.A.C. 13:13-1.2(a).

The undisputed\n\nfacts in this case show that A.T. received a FAPE and there was\n\nno evidence presented that any other class member did not or\n\nwill not receive a FAPE.             Under the IDEA and state law, this is\n\nprecisely the special education benefit made available to A.T.\n\n\n\n\n                                            27                                    A-2424-12T1\n\f      Accordingly,     guided         by     the    previously     cited      cases\n\nconcerning the RA, the ADA, and the IDEA, we hold that, when a\n\nLAD discrimination claim concerns the special education benefits\n\nand related services available to a child under the IDEA, the\n\nprogram or benefit used to determine the prima facie test for\n\ndisability discrimination is the provision of a FAPE.                      Relying\n\nfurther on the similarity between the RA, the ADA, and the LAD,\n\nwe also hold that if a disabled child is not entitled to a\n\nneighborhood school placement under the ADA or the RA, he or she\n\nis not entitled to such placement under the LAD.\n\n      Plainly, the issue of the location of special education\n\nservices is a component of the IEP process aimed at developing a\n\nFAPE.   The same facts underlying A.T.'s IDEA claim and RA claim\n\nare   the   core   facts   in   his    LAD      claim.   Federal    courts      have\n\nroutinely rejected claims that placement in a non-neighborhood\n\nschool for purposes of receiving special education and related\n\nservices is a form of disability discrimination under the RA or\n\nthe ADA.    See White, supra, 343 F.3d at 381.             In fact, the Third\n\nCircuit rejected plaintiffs' claim of RA discrimination based on\n\nnon-neighborhood school placement in affirming the dismissal of\n\nthe federal litigation here.               Plaintiffs have not cited and our\n\nresearch has not revealed any cases that held that the failure\n\nto provide a FAPE in the neighborhood school violated the RA or\n\n\n\n\n                                           28                              A-2424-12T1\n\fthe ADA.\n\n      Plaintiffs    incorrectly        seek          to     isolate     one       specific\n\ncomponent   of   A.T.'s     IEP,    the    inclusion          class     location,       and\n\nassert that it violates the right to attend one's neighborhood\n\nschool, purportedly a separate and distinct benefit from the\n\neducational benefits provided under the IDEA.                       Separation of one\n\ncomponent   of     the    FAPE     from        all    the     other     services        and\n\nconsiderations     that   went     into    the       IEP    in   this    case      is   not\n\nappropriate.     We cannot agree that, for purposes of the three\n\nelements of the prima facie test, there is a separate stand-\n\nalone benefit of attending the neighborhood school unrelated to\n\nthe provision of a FAPE.           This argument has not been successful\n\nunder the RA or the ADA and, based upon previously stated RA and\n\nADA   principles,   it    must     fail    here.           Simply     put,    where     the\n\ndisabled child's placement is determined as part of the IDEA\n\nprocess, the program or benefit the school district must provide\n\nis the provision of a FAPE.         Andrew M., supra, 490 F.3d at 350.\n\n      Plaintiffs    argue    further      that       centralization          of    special\n\neducation services, although admittedly correct under the IDEA\n\nand federal and state special education regulations, denies a\n\nchild access to his neighborhood school in violation of state\n\nand federal regulations requiring that all public facilities be\n\naccessible to persons with disabilities.                     Based upon RA and ADA\n\n\n\n\n                                          29                                      A-2424-12T1\n\fprinciples addressing special education benefits, this argument\n\nis also unpersuasive.             Moreover, the district has not denied\n\nA.T.    physical    access   to    his   neighborhood      school;    indeed,    he\n\nattended Selzer for the pre-school class and for first grade.\n\nHe did not attend Selzer for kindergarten because his IEP, aimed\n\nat providing a FAPE, called for him to be in an inclusion class,\n\nwhich    was    held   at    Grant.       Thus,       plaintiffs'    reliance    on\n\nregulations concerning physical access is misplaced here.\n\n       Additionally,    we    reject     plaintiffs'      contention    that    the\n\nprovision of special transportation services to bus A.T. to his\n\nspecial education program constitutes a separate violation of\n\nthe LAD.       Transportation is a related service which cannot be\n\nsegregated from the child's individual IEP and FAPE.                    The IDEA\n\nrequires transportation to be provided as a related service when\n\nit is necessary to enable a child with a disability to benefit\n\nfrom     education.          20     U.S.C.A.      §     1401(26)(A).        Thus,\n\ntransportation is not a separate educational component but is a\n\nmeans to assist the child in receiving the FAPE as designed by\n\nthe IEP.       If an individual student is aggrieved by the provision\n\nor non-provision of transportation, he or she can file for due\n\nprocess under the IDEA and request a change.                   See Tyler W. v.\n\nUpper Perkiomen Sch. Dist., 963 F. Supp 2d 427, 436-37 (E.D.

Oberti, an\n\nIDEA   case,     highlighted      the    undisputed       legal     principle      that,\n\nunder the IDEA, the preferred placement for special education\n\nservices    is     the    least      restrictive        environment,         but    also\n\nacknowledged, as do all the cases concerning least restrictive\n\nenvironment, that the placement depends on the child's unique\n\nneeds as determined by a properly constructed IEP.                             Oberti,\n\nsupra, 995 F.2d at 1214-15.                   Importantly, Oberti underscores\n\nthat the IDEA governs the decision on where the child receives\n\nspecial education services and if a child is aggrieved by the\n\nplacement, the remedy is to file a due process petition alleging\n\nfailure to comply with the IDEA.                  20 U.S.C.A. 1415(b)(6).          Here,\n\nplaintiffs seek to make an end run around the IDEA by dismissing\n\nthe due process petition and repackaging the claim as a class\n\naction under the LAD.\n\n       Likewise, Hornstine is inapposite here.                     In Hornstine, the\n\ndistrict   court    engaged     in      an    extensive      discussion     about    the\n\noverlapping of the IDEA, the RA, and the ADA and determined that\n\nthe issue before it, a high school's qualification requirements\n\n\n\n\n                                             31                                A-2424-12T1\n\ffor valedictorian, was not part of the child's IEP and was not\n\ncovered      by   the    IDEA;    hence,      the     plaintiff     did    not   have   to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.                   Hornstine, supra, 263 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 901-02, 913.             In stark contrast, the inclusion class here\n\nis part of the IEP and part of the benefit made available to\n\nA.T.   under       the   IDEA.        Thus,    Hornstine       supports     defendants'\n\nassertions that when the dispute is based upon benefits provided\n\npursuant to the IDEA, the LAD claim is coextensive with the IDEA\n\nand the RA claims.             Additionally, plaintiffs' reliance on D.G.\n\nis misdirected because there the school district did not provide\n\nany special education program or benefits, which supported the\n\nplaintiff's        RA    and    LAD    claims        for    failure   to    provide     an\n\neducational benefit.            D.G., supra, 559 F. Supp. 2d at 488-90.\n\n       No evidence in the record demonstrates that A.T. did not\n\nreceive the appropriate educational program from the inclusion\n\nplacement at Grant or that any of plaintiffs' rights under the\n\nIDEA were violated.            Instead, it was acknowledged that placement\n\nin the inclusion class benefitted A.T., both educationally and\n\nsocially.         Nor were any facts provided that any other children\n\ndid    not   receive      a    FAPE    or     were    actually     harmed.        Rather,\n\nplaintiffs'        expert      made   a   sweeping         claim   that    all   children\n\nprovided with special education services in a non-neighborhood\n\nschool or provided with the related service of transportation,\n\n\n\n\n                                              32                                 A-2424-12T1\n\fare harmed by the stigma of being singled out as disabled.                                  The\n\nexpert never evaluated A.T. or any of the other putative class\n\nmembers nor did she identify the specific harm suffered by these\n\nchildren.      Since A.T. received the educational benefit to which\n\nhe   was    entitled       under    the   IDEA,        the   Third     Circuit      found    no\n\nevidence of harm under the IDEA or the RA, and we perceive no\n\nactual harm here under the LAD.\n\n      In sum, we conclude that for purposes of establishing a\n\nprima      facie    case    of    disability       discrimination        under      the     LAD\n\nwhere the facts concern the provision of special education and\n\nrelated     services,       the     program      or    benefit    measured       under      the\n\nthird element is the provision of a FAPE.                        To be sure, when the\n\ndiscrimination claimed does not pertain to special education and\n\nrelated     services,       the     particular         benefit   or    program      will     be\n\ndifferent.         Because here, the alleged discriminatory component,\n\nthe location of the services, was part of the comprehensive IEP\n\ndeveloped     to     provide       A.T.   with     a    FAPE,    and    did    so   provide,\n\nplaintiffs         have    not     demonstrated         a    prima     facie     claim      for\n\ndisability discrimination under the LAD.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33                                     A-2424-12T1\n\f",

Because\n\nplaintiffs did not demonstrate they were deprived of a benefit\n\ndue   to   a    disability      and     thus       failed    to   make    a    prima     facie\n\nshowing of disability discrimination under the LAD, we affirm.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       The record reveals that J.T. and her minor son A.T. resided\n\nin    Dumont,    a    town     of   about      two    square      miles.        The    school\n\ndistrict of Dumont has four elementary schools: Selzer, Grant,\n\nHoniss, and Lincoln.            In both the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school\n\nyears,     about      180    students     attended          kindergarten        within      the\n\ndistrict.       The school district's policy provided that generally\n\nchildren       were     to    attend     their        neighborhood        schools.            An\n\nexception      to     the    policy    was     when    the    child's      Individualized\n\nEducation Plan (IEP) required special education services that\n\nwere provided in a different school.\n\n       Beginning       in     the     2008-2009       school      year,       the   district\n\noffered an inclusion kindergarten class in addition to a self-\n\ncontained kindergarten class.                  The self-contained classroom had\n\nonly children whose needs, according to their IEPs, warranted a\n\nfull-time special education teacher.                        The inclusion classroom,\n\n\n\n\n                                               3                                      A-2424-12T1\n\fon   the    other     hand,   had   both       general     education      and    special\n\neducation students who were taught the regular curriculum by a\n\nfull-time      general        education        teacher      with     the      part-time\n\nassistance of a special education teacher.                    The amount of time\n\nthat    the   special     education       teacher    spent     in       the   inclusion\n\nclassroom varied according to the combined requirements of the\n\nchildren's IEPs.         Both the inclusion and self-contained classes\n\nwere located in the same school building each year.\n\n       In each of the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 school years, four\n\nspecial needs children were placed in the inclusion kindergarten\n\nclassroom as required by their IEPs.2                    In the 2010-2011 school\n\nyear, only one student with disabilities was in the inclusion\n\nclass.      Each year during this same period, depending on their\n\nindividual     educational       needs     as     determined       by    their      IEPs,\n\nseveral     special    education    children        were    placed      in    the   self-\n\ncontained kindergarten classroom, in out-of-district placements,\n\nor     in   regular    kindergartens       in     their     neighborhood         schools\n\nbecause they needed only support services, not special education\n\nteachers, to carry out their IEPs.3\n\n\n2\n  Inclusion classrooms may contain up to eight students with\nspecial needs. N.J.A.C. 6A:14-4.6(n).\n3\n  At least one child was in a regular education classroom without\nspecial services because his parents declined the inclusion\nplacement in favor of placement in the neighborhood school\n                                                      (continued)\n\n\n                                           4                                    A-2424-12T1\n\f      When    A.T.     was   three    years   old,    he    was     diagnosed     with\n\nchildhood autism, a pervasive developmental disorder.                         In the\n\n2008-2009     school     year,     pursuant   to     his    IEP,    A.T.     attended\n\npreschool in the district's inclusion classroom in Selzer, his\n\nneighborhood school, for half the day and spent the remainder of\n\nthe day in an out-of-district self-contained program.\n\n      In May 2009, the district personnel and J.T. met to discuss\n\nA.T.'s IEP for his upcoming kindergarten year.                       J.T. and the\n\ndistrict      agreed     that      A.T.   needed     some       special     education\n\nservices.      The district personnel proposed moving him from a\n\nself-contained class to the district's inclusion class, to be\n\nheld in Grant.          The inclusion class was taught by a regular\n\neducation teacher who followed a regular education curriculum.\n\nThe   class    also    had    fewer   students     than     a    regular    education\n\nkindergarten     class       and   provided   services          according    to   each\n\nspecial education student's IEP with the assistance of a part-\n\ntime special education teacher.\n\n      In contrast, J.T. wanted A.T. to attend a general education\n\nclassroom at his home school, Selzer, with the supports provided\n\nin that classroom.           The district personnel did not think this\n\noption met A.T.'s special needs; rather, they reasoned that A.T.\n\n\n(continued)\nwithout a special education teacher's services.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5                                  A-2424-12T1\n\fneeded the integrated services, smaller class size, and in-class\n\nspecial       education    teacher     to       enable     A.T.    to    retain    and\n\ngeneralize information in order to meet the goal of readying him\n\nfor a regular education classroom for the next year.                        Although\n\nJ.T. did not agree, the final IEP designated A.T.'s educational\n\nplacement as the inclusion kindergarten class at Grant.\n\n      In June 2009, J.T. filed a due process petition with the\n\nNew      Jersey        Department      of       Education         challenging      the\n\nappropriateness of the IEP's inclusion placement at Grant rather\n\nthan a regular education placement at Selzer.                           In September\n\n2009, A.T. began attending the inclusion kindergarten class at\n\nGrant.        Shortly thereafter, on September 28, 2009, plaintiffs\n\nfiled     a    class    action   complaint        in     federal    court   alleging\n\nviolations of (1) the Individuals with Disabilities Education\n\nAct (IDEA), 20 U.S.C.A. §§ 1400-1485, based on the district's\n\nfailure       to   educate       children       in     the    least      restrictive\n\nenvironment, (2) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), 29\n\nU.S.C.A. § 794, due to discrimination against class members, and\n\n(3) the LAD for failing to accommodate class members in their\n\nneighborhood       school.       In   November       2009,   plaintiffs     withdrew\n\ntheir due process petition.\n\n      While the federal litigation was pending, A.T. completed\n\nhis kindergarten year in the inclusion class.

Mar. 28, 2012) (internal citations omitted).\n\n       In finding that plaintiffs failed to establish a concrete\n\nand particularized harm, the court reasoned:\n\n              Plaintiffs may not establish their standing\n              based solely on the argument that Dumont\n              committed a procedural violation by failing\n              to consider whether the exact same services\n              should be provided in a child's neighborhood\n              school.   Crucially, Plaintiffs have failed\n\n\n\n                                              7                                 A-2424-12T1\n\f           to   identify,  or   they  have  abandoned,\n           assertions that Dumont's policy resulted in\n           the loss of an educational opportunity,\n           seriously deprived parents of participation\n           rights, or deprived students of educational\n           benefits.\n\n           [Id. at *42.]\n\n    The court also found that plaintiffs' voluntary failure to\n\npursue    their     administrative      remedies    was   fatal       to      their\n\ncomplaint.     According to the court, \"[t]he evidence does not\n\nsupport Plaintiffs' claim that Dumont used the inclusion class\n\nto systematically avoid the IDEA's requirement to individually\n\nconsider students' needs when making placement decisions.\"                       Id.\n\nat *54.      On the issue of whether the placement was the least\n\nrestrictive environment, the court pointed out that plaintiffs\n\nand any kindergartener affected by an inclusion placement, \"can\n\n[and must] seek redress on this substantive claim through the\n\nadministrative process.\"          Id. at *55.\n\n    Addressing       plaintiffs'     claim   that   placement    in   the      non-\n\nneighborhood school was a violation of the RA, the court found\n\nthat \"[f]or the same reasons Plaintiffs have failed to show that\n\nthey suffered an injury under the IDEA, Plaintiffs have failed\n\nto establish that J.T. has been discriminated against due to his\n\ndisability.\"        Id. at *58.      The court specifically found that\n\nplaintiffs'    RA    claim   of   discrimination    due   to    not   attending\n\none's neighborhood school was based upon the same facts as their\n\n\n\n                                       8                                   A-2424-12T1\n\fIDEA claim.      Ibid.      Having dismissed the federal claims for lack\n\nof subject matter jurisdiction, the district court declined to\n\nexercise     supplemental          jurisdiction        over      the    LAD   claims    and\n\ndismissed them without prejudice.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       Shortly      after    the    dismissal        of    the    federal      complaint,\n\nplaintiffs filed a civil complaint in the Chancery Division.\n\nThe    complaint     alleged       violations     of      the    LAD,    including     that\n\ndefendants discriminated against the putative class members due\n\nto their disabilities by (1) forcing them to receive required\n\nspecial      education      services       in    a     school      other      than    their\n\nneighborhood school, (2) failing to consider the placements or\n\nthe provision of transportation on an individual basis, and (3)\n\nsegregating class members due to their special education needs.\n\nPlaintiffs sought a declaration that defendants had failed to\n\nobey   the    LAD    and    asked    for   an    order     requiring,         among   other\n\nrelief, that all class members be educated in their neighborhood\n\nschool whenever possible, an in-class special education teacher\n\nbe furnished in each of the class members' neighborhood school,\n\nand a court-appointed Special Master paid for by the district to\n\nreview all IEPs and determine defendants' compliance with these\n\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9                                     A-2424-12T1\n\f      After agreeing to rely on the discovery obtained in the\n\nfederal case, the parties moved for partial summary judgment as\n\nto   liability       under    the    LAD.           In    analyzing       plaintiffs'         LAD\n\ndisability      accommodation             claim,         the    judge     found        it    was\n\nundisputed     that     A.T.    had       a    disability        and     that    the    school\n\ndistrict       was     an      entity          required          to     make      reasonable\n\naccommodations unless the school district demonstrated that such\n\naccommodations would impose an undue burden to its operation.\n\nN.J.A.C. 13:13-4.11.           Employing the standard from the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 12101-12213, the\n\njudge found that to state a claim for failure to accommodate, a\n\nplaintiff must show that he or she (1) has a disability; (2) is\n\notherwise qualified to participate in a program; and (3) was\n\ndenied   the    benefits       of   the       program      or    discriminated         against\n\nbecause of the disability.\n\n      The   judge     noted     that      under      the       IDEA,    centralization        of\n\nprograms was lawful and determined that plaintiffs failed to\n\nshow that the centralization of the program deprived them of a\n\nbenefit.       Based     upon       the       circumstances           present,    the       judge\n\nreasoned     that     program       accessibility,              rather     than     facility\n\naccessibility, was key to the implementation of the ADA, and by\n\nimplication the LAD.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10                                      A-2424-12T1\n\f    The judge found that plaintiffs established the first two\n\nelements but did not show that the district deprived A.T. of a\n\ncognizable benefit or program due to a disability.                           \"To the\n\ncontrary,     the     [p]laintiffs        received         all     the      necessary\n\neducational    benefits,       programs       and    extracurricular        resources\n\nrequired under the law.\"              Although the judge recognized that\n\nthere was a pedagogical benefit to attending one's neighborhood\n\nschool, \"all other things being equal,\" he emphasized that A.T.\n\nthrived in his kindergarten class, educationally and socially,\n\nand that there was no evidence that A.T. or any of the putative\n\nclass   members     suffered    actual    harm       by   not    attending    his   or\n\nneighborhood school or by being bused to school.                      Accordingly,\n\nthe judge dismissed the complaint.              This appeal followed.\n\n    While this appeal was pending, the Third Circuit upheld the\n\ndistrict    court's    decision    dismissing         plaintiffs     IDEA     and   RA\n\nclaims on April 26, 2013.          J.T. v. Dumont Pub. Schs., 533 Fed.\n\nApp'x 44, 55 (3d Cir. 2013).           The circuit court emphasized that\n\n\"IDEA permits schools to provide special education services in a\n\ncentralized location.\"         Id. at 49.           The circuit court concurred\n\nthat there was no substantive harm shown to A.T. or any of the\n\nputative class members          as there was \"no denial of services,\n\nopportunities, participation, or benefits.\"                      Id. at 50.         The\n\ncircuit    court    also   rejected    plaintiffs'         claim    under    the    RA,\n\n\n\n\n                                         11                                  A-2424-12T1\n\freasoning that \"when [RA] claims are based on violations of the\n\nIDEA, the [RA] claims are derivative of the IDEA claims.\"                          Id.\n\nat 52 (internal citations omitted).\n\n      In    addition,        the     circuit     court    explicitly        rejected\n\nplaintiffs' claim that they suffered additional injury under the\n\nRA because they were bused out of their neighborhood and located\n\nin a different part of the school from the regular education\n\nclassrooms, thus marking them as disabled in the eyes of their\n\npeers.      Ibid.    The court found that Doe v. National Board of\n\nMedical Examiners, 199 F.3d. 146, 153 (3d Cir. 1999), which held\n\nthat under certain circumstances, merely identifying a person as\n\ndisabled     can    be   a    violation    of     the    RA,    did   not     support\n\nplaintiffs' RA claims.             J.T., supra, 533 Fed. App'x at 52.              The\n\ncourt found that busing students in compliance with their IEPs\n\nwas   not    such   a    circumstance,         stating   \"[i]n    contrast,      IDEA\n\nrequires school districts to identify students in need in order\n\nto provide them special education services.                    Busing students to\n\na centralized location for special services may be integral to\n\nIDEA compliance and, depending on the IEP, is sought by many\n\nparents     of   children     with     special    needs.\"        Ibid.      (internal\n\ncitations omitted).

Plaintiffs contend that\n\nattending     one's    neighborhood        school      is    a    cognizable      benefit\n\nprotected      under   the     LAD,     and     that        the    judge    incorrectly\n\ndistinguished       between    program      and     facility        accessibility        in\n\nanalyzing the benefit.              Further, plaintiffs contend that the\n\njudge's      determination     that     plaintiffs          provided       no   proof     of\n\nactual harm was erroneous because plaintiffs' expert's report\n\ndescribed such harm.\n\n     Amici, consisting of several non-profit organizations that\n\nadvocate for the rights of children with disabilities, support\n\nplaintiffs'     arguments.          They   submit      that       studies       show   that\n\nchildren with disabilities benefit more from being in regular\n\neducation     classrooms      with    regular     education         students,      rather\n\n\n4\n   In   considering   J.T.'s   failure  to   exhaust  the   IDEA\nadministrative remedies, the court observed that while J.T.\nframed the complaint as an overall challenge to a general school\npolicy, the determination of the effect of any district policy\non each IEP entailed a factually-intensive inquiry, which the\nIDEA administrative process was designed to address, noting\nthat\"[t]his claim addresses only one component of the school\ndistrict's educational program . . . .\" Id. at 54.\n\n\n\n                                           13                                     A-2424-12T1\n\fthan being segregated in special education classes with only\n\ndisabled    students.     They     also    contend    that   children    are\n\nstigmatized as different by having to take a small school bus to\n\ntheir programs.    Amici further argue that the school district's\n\npolicy of centralizing the inclusion kindergarten class denied\n\nthe putative class members of benefits they would have enjoyed\n\nif they had attended integrated classrooms in their neighborhood\n\nschools.\n\n    Defendants maintain that no LAD violation occurred because\n\nunder the IDEA and state law, a school district has discretion\n\nin determining the location and type of services that a child\n\nneeds to receive an appropriate education in accordance with the\n\nchild's    IEP.   They   also    argue    that   because   plaintiffs'   LAD\n\nclaims are based upon the same core facts as their IDEA claims,\n\nthe LAD claims are derivative of the IDEA claims and fail for\n\nthe same reasons as the IDEA and the RA claims.                 Defendants\n\nfurther contend that plaintiffs failed to establish that A.T.\n\nwas deprived of a benefit or, in the alternative, submit that\n\nthe IEPs were a reasonable accommodation based upon each child's\n\nindividual disability.      Finally, defendants urge us to affirm\n\nthe trial court's decision because the record does not contain\n\nany proof of actual harm.\n\n\n\n\n                                    14                             A-2424-12T1\n\f       We begin with a review of the applicable legal principles\n\nthat   guide    our     analysis.

The undisputed\n\nfacts in this case show that A.T. received a FAPE and there was\n\nno evidence presented that any other class member did not or\n\nwill not receive a FAPE.             Under the IDEA and state law, this is\n\nprecisely the special education benefit made available to A.T.\n\n\n\n\n                                            27                                    A-2424-12T1\n\f      Accordingly,     guided         by     the    previously     cited      cases\n\nconcerning the RA, the ADA, and the IDEA, we hold that, when a\n\nLAD discrimination claim concerns the special education benefits\n\nand related services available to a child under the IDEA, the\n\nprogram or benefit used to determine the prima facie test for\n\ndisability discrimination is the provision of a FAPE.                      Relying\n\nfurther on the similarity between the RA, the ADA, and the LAD,\n\nwe also hold that if a disabled child is not entitled to a\n\nneighborhood school placement under the ADA or the RA, he or she\n\nis not entitled to such placement under the LAD.\n\n      Plainly, the issue of the location of special education\n\nservices is a component of the IEP process aimed at developing a\n\nFAPE.   The same facts underlying A.T.'s IDEA claim and RA claim\n\nare   the   core   facts   in   his    LAD      claim.   Federal    courts      have\n\nroutinely rejected claims that placement in a non-neighborhood\n\nschool for purposes of receiving special education and related\n\nservices is a form of disability discrimination under the RA or\n\nthe ADA.    See White, supra, 343 F.3d at 381.             In fact, the Third\n\nCircuit rejected plaintiffs' claim of RA discrimination based on\n\nnon-neighborhood school placement in affirming the dismissal of\n\nthe federal litigation here.               Plaintiffs have not cited and our\n\nresearch has not revealed any cases that held that the failure\n\nto provide a FAPE in the neighborhood school violated the RA or\n\n\n\n\n                                           28                              A-2424-12T1\n\fthe ADA.\n\n      Plaintiffs    incorrectly        seek          to     isolate     one       specific\n\ncomponent   of   A.T.'s     IEP,    the    inclusion          class     location,       and\n\nassert that it violates the right to attend one's neighborhood\n\nschool, purportedly a separate and distinct benefit from the\n\neducational benefits provided under the IDEA.                       Separation of one\n\ncomponent   of     the    FAPE     from        all    the     other     services        and\n\nconsiderations     that   went     into    the       IEP    in   this    case      is   not\n\nappropriate.     We cannot agree that, for purposes of the three\n\nelements of the prima facie test, there is a separate stand-\n\nalone benefit of attending the neighborhood school unrelated to\n\nthe provision of a FAPE.           This argument has not been successful\n\nunder the RA or the ADA and, based upon previously stated RA and\n\nADA   principles,   it    must     fail    here.           Simply     put,    where     the\n\ndisabled child's placement is determined as part of the IDEA\n\nprocess, the program or benefit the school district must provide\n\nis the provision of a FAPE.         Andrew M., supra, 490 F.3d at 350.\n\n      Plaintiffs    argue    further      that       centralization          of    special\n\neducation services, although admittedly correct under the IDEA\n\nand federal and state special education regulations, denies a\n\nchild access to his neighborhood school in violation of state\n\nand federal regulations requiring that all public facilities be\n\naccessible to persons with disabilities.                     Based upon RA and ADA\n\n\n\n\n                                          29                                      A-2424-12T1\n\fprinciples addressing special education benefits, this argument\n\nis also unpersuasive.             Moreover, the district has not denied\n\nA.T.    physical    access   to    his   neighborhood      school;    indeed,    he\n\nattended Selzer for the pre-school class and for first grade.\n\nHe did not attend Selzer for kindergarten because his IEP, aimed\n\nat providing a FAPE, called for him to be in an inclusion class,\n\nwhich    was    held   at    Grant.       Thus,       plaintiffs'    reliance    on\n\nregulations concerning physical access is misplaced here.\n\n       Additionally,    we    reject     plaintiffs'      contention    that    the\n\nprovision of special transportation services to bus A.T. to his\n\nspecial education program constitutes a separate violation of\n\nthe LAD.       Transportation is a related service which cannot be\n\nsegregated from the child's individual IEP and FAPE.                    The IDEA\n\nrequires transportation to be provided as a related service when\n\nit is necessary to enable a child with a disability to benefit\n\nfrom     education.          20     U.S.C.A.      §     1401(26)(A).        Thus,\n\ntransportation is not a separate educational component but is a\n\nmeans to assist the child in receiving the FAPE as designed by\n\nthe IEP.       If an individual student is aggrieved by the provision\n\nor non-provision of transportation, he or she can file for due\n\nprocess under the IDEA and request a change.                   See Tyler W. v.\n\nUpper Perkiomen Sch. Dist., 963 F. Supp 2d 427, 436-37 (E.D.

Oberti, an\n\nIDEA   case,     highlighted      the    undisputed       legal     principle      that,\n\nunder the IDEA, the preferred placement for special education\n\nservices    is     the    least      restrictive        environment,         but    also\n\nacknowledged, as do all the cases concerning least restrictive\n\nenvironment, that the placement depends on the child's unique\n\nneeds as determined by a properly constructed IEP.                             Oberti,\n\nsupra, 995 F.2d at 1214-15.                   Importantly, Oberti underscores\n\nthat the IDEA governs the decision on where the child receives\n\nspecial education services and if a child is aggrieved by the\n\nplacement, the remedy is to file a due process petition alleging\n\nfailure to comply with the IDEA.                  20 U.S.C.A. 1415(b)(6).          Here,\n\nplaintiffs seek to make an end run around the IDEA by dismissing\n\nthe due process petition and repackaging the claim as a class\n\naction under the LAD.\n\n       Likewise, Hornstine is inapposite here.                     In Hornstine, the\n\ndistrict   court    engaged     in      an    extensive      discussion     about    the\n\noverlapping of the IDEA, the RA, and the ADA and determined that\n\nthe issue before it, a high school's qualification requirements\n\n\n\n\n                                             31                                A-2424-12T1\n\ffor valedictorian, was not part of the child's IEP and was not\n\ncovered      by   the    IDEA;    hence,      the     plaintiff     did    not   have   to\n\nexhaust administrative remedies.

In stark contrast, the inclusion class here\n\nis part of the IEP and part of the benefit made available to\n\nA.T.   under       the   IDEA.        Thus,    Hornstine       supports     defendants'\n\nassertions that when the dispute is based upon benefits provided\n\npursuant to the IDEA, the LAD claim is coextensive with the IDEA\n\nand the RA claims.             Additionally, plaintiffs' reliance on D.G.\n\nis misdirected because there the school district did not provide\n\nany special education program or benefits, which supported the\n\nplaintiff's        RA    and    LAD    claims        for    failure   to    provide     an\n\neducational benefit.            D.G., supra, 559 F. Supp. 2d at 488-90.\n\n       No evidence in the record demonstrates that A.T. did not\n\nreceive the appropriate educational program from the inclusion\n\nplacement at Grant or that any of plaintiffs' rights under the\n\nIDEA were violated.            Instead, it was acknowledged that placement\n\nin the inclusion class benefitted A.T., both educationally and\n\nsocially.         Nor were any facts provided that any other children\n\ndid    not   receive      a    FAPE    or     were    actually     harmed.        Rather,\n\nplaintiffs'        expert      made   a   sweeping         claim   that    all   children\n\nprovided with special education services in a non-neighborhood\n\nschool or provided with the related service of transportation,\n\n\n\n\n                                              32                                 A-2424-12T1\n\fare harmed by the stigma of being singled out as disabled.                                  The\n\nexpert never evaluated A.T. or any of the other putative class\n\nmembers nor did she identify the specific harm suffered by these\n\nchildren.      Since A.T. received the educational benefit to which\n\nhe   was    entitled       under    the   IDEA,        the   Third     Circuit      found    no\n\nevidence of harm under the IDEA or the RA, and we perceive no\n\nactual harm here under the LAD.\n\n      In sum, we conclude that for purposes of establishing a\n\nprima      facie    case    of    disability       discrimination        under      the     LAD\n\nwhere the facts concern the provision of special education and\n\nrelated     services,       the     program      or    benefit    measured       under      the\n\nthird element is the provision of a FAPE.                        To be sure, when the\n\ndiscrimination claimed does not pertain to special education and\n\nrelated     services,       the     particular         benefit   or    program      will     be\n\ndifferent.         Because here, the alleged discriminatory component,\n\nthe location of the services, was part of the comprehensive IEP\n\ndeveloped     to     provide       A.T.   with     a    FAPE,    and    did    so   provide,\n\nplaintiffs         have    not     demonstrated         a    prima     facie     claim      for\n\ndisability discrimination under the LAD.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33                                     A-2424-12T1\n\f</pre>",
