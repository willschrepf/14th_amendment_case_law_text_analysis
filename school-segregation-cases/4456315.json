The facts are voluminous and the issues on appeal\n\nare complex. It is respectfully suggested argument would assist the Court in its\n\ndecisional process.\n\n\n                               Statement of the Case\n\n\n      This is an appeal from a criminal proceeding. Petetan was indicted by a\n\nMcLennan County grand jury for the offense of capital murder (1 CR 44). It was\n\nalleged Petetan murdered his wife, Kimberly Petetan, by shooting her with a\n\nfirearm while he was in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\n\noffenses of burglary, kidnapping, and retaliation (1 CR 44). The State gave notice\n\nof its intent to seek the death penalty (2 RR 6).\n\n\n      Petetan asserted he was incompetent to stand trial and sought a competency\n\ndetermination by a jury (2 CR 383). A competency jury was selected and sworn\n\n(10 RR 109, 110). The jury found Petetan competent to stand trial (2 CR 453, 13\n\nRR 94).\n\n\n      A jury was selected and sworn for trial on the charged offense of capital\n\nmurder (48 RR 108, 50 RR 192, and 51 RR 16). Petetan entered a plea of not\n\nguilty to the indicted offense (51 RR 26). At the conclusion of the guilt or\n\n\n                                         -1-\n\finnocence phase, the jury found Petetan guilty of capital murder as charged in the\n\nindictment (4 CR 1308, 54 RR 224).\n\n\n      Punishment was tried to the same jury (55-60 RR). At the conclusion of the\n\npunishment phase, the jury returned answers to four special issues (4 CR 1336-\n\n1339, 60 RR 67-68). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, punishment\n\nwas assessed by the trial court at death and Petetan was sentenced in open court\n\n(60 RR 71).\n\n\n      A motion for new trial was filed and denied (4 CR 1377, 1382). Appeal to\n\nthis Court is automatic. Nonetheless, the trial court certified Petetan’s right to\n\nappeal and notice of appeal was timely filed (4 CR 1348, 1353).\n\n\n                            Issues Presented on Appeal\n\n\nPoint of Error One\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege as to testimony he sought to offer from his former\n\nattorney on the issue of competency to stand trial (13 RR 57).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fPoint of Error Two\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence Petetan sought to\n\noffer concerning the legal fate of those who obtain an incompetency\n\ndetermination through malingering (13 RR 60).\n\n\nPoint of Error Three\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (28 RR\n\n89).\n\n\nPoint of Error Four\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who believed law enforcement officers to\n\nbe more credible than other witnesses (28 RR 89).\n\n\nPoint of Error Five\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Luther Fore who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (30 RR\n\n174).\n                                      -3-\n\fPoint of Error Six\n\n\nThe evidence is insufficient to prove Petetan murdered the complainant while\n\nin the course of committing or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\nPoint of Error Seven\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Miller he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Miller drugs if he would drive Petetan to\n\nWaco (53 RR 31).\n\n\nPoint of Error Eight\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Mouton he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Mouton drugs if he would accompany\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 31).\n\n\nPoint of Error Nine\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence which undermined\n\ndefense counsel before the jury and created a conflict of interest which denied\n\nPetetan his right to the effective assistance of counsel (59 RR 198).\n                                         -4-\n\fPoint of Error Ten\n\n\nThe jury’s answer to the intellectual disability special issue is against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\nPoint of Error Eleven\n\n\nPetetan’s intellectual disability renders him ineligible for the death penalty.\n\n\nPoint of Error Twelve\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “militate” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Thirteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection to the instruction that\n\n10 votes were required for the jury to return a “no” answer to the first special\n\nissue concerning future dangerousness (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR\n\n212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Fourteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection to the “anti-sympathy”\n\ninstruction insofar as the instruction would limit the scope of mitigating\n\n                                       -5-\n\fevidence and or circumstances that jury may consider in returning a life\n\nsentence (4 CR 1320, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Fifteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s request that the jury be\n\ninstructed on the concept of mercy and the role it can play in deliberations (4\n\nCR 1320, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Sixteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by submitting a special issue on future dangerousness\n\nwhich was not found by the grand jury or alleged in the indictment returned\n\nagainst Petetan (1 CR 44, 4 CR 1321, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Seventeen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “probability” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1321, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fPoint of Error Eighteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrase “criminal acts of violence”\n\nwithin the punishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1322, 4 CR 1330,\n\nand 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Nineteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrase “continuing threat to\n\nsociety” within the punishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1323, 4\n\nCR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to submit Petetan’s four requested instructions\n\nrelative to the jury’s consideration of victim impact evidence (4 CR 1324, 4\n\nCR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-One\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrases “personal moral\n\nculpability” and “moral blameworthiness” within the punishment charge as\n\nrequested by Petetan (4 CR 1325, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fPoint of Error Twenty-Two\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the charge unduly\n\nlimited what factors the jury could consider as mitigating (4 CR 1325, 4 CR\n\n1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Three\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the mitigation\n\nspecial issue is unconstitutional for failing to assign a burden of proof and not\n\nbeing susceptible to a sufficiency of the evidence review on appeal (4 CR 1326,\n\n4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Four\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the jury should be\n\ninstructed there is a presumption in favor of a life sentence rather than a\n\nsentence of death (4 CR 1327, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Five\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the jury should be\n\ninstructed that if it was unable to agree on a special issue, a mistrial would be\n\ndeclared and life sentence imposed (4 CR 1326, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fPoint of Error Twenty-Six\n\n\nImposition of the death penalty violates Petetan’s Eighth Amendment and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Seven\n\n\nPetetan was denied equal protection of the law and due course of law due to\n\nthe absence of a unified statutory procedure for pretrial litigation of an Atkins\n\nassertion of intellectual disability (18 RR 12, 4 CR 1228).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Eight\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect Petetan was convicted of\n\na capital felony offense rather than a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Nine\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect punishment was assessed\n\nby the trial court rather than the jury (4 CR 1343).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f                                 Statement of Facts\n\n\n                               A. Competency Trial\n\n\n       Petetan filed a motion, supported by the affidavit of an expert, alleging he\n\nwas incompetent to stand trial (2 CR 383). He sought a jury determination of his\n\ncompetency to be tried (2 CR 383). The trial court appointed an independent\n\nexpert to examine Petetan’s competency to stand trial (2 CR 392). That expert\n\nopined Petetan was competent for trial (2 CR 414). In view of the conflicting\n\nopinions regarding Petetan’s competency, the trial court agreed a jury trial on\n\ncompetency was warranted (8 RR 5). A jury to pass on the issue of competency\n\nwas selected and sworn (10 RR 109, 110).\n\n\n       Dr. Ollie Seay is a psychologist from Austin (12 RR 32). She was employed\n\nby the defense to examine Petetan relative to his competency to stand trial (12 RR\n\n49).\n\n\n       She explained that in current practice the term intellectual disability is used\n\nrather than the outdated term mental retardation (12 RR 43). She agreed both\n\nterms have the same definition and three prongs to determine existence (12 RR\n\n43). Intellectual disability alone will not render an individual incompetent for trial\n\n(12 RR 48).\n\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\f       She met with Petetan on three occasions and administered various\n\nassessment tests (12 RR 51). She reviewed police reports, medical reports, school\n\nrecords, and other psychological records (12 RR 53). Even though she did not\n\nadminister an IQ test, previous IQ testing provided to her raised some concerns for\n\nher and those concerns were confirmed by her testing of and interaction with\n\nPetetan (12 RR 63, 99). Various test results from IQ tests administered to Petetan\n\nfrom childhood to 2012 were consistent in their results (12 RR 165).\n\n\n       She administered a test designed to determine competency for those with\n\nintellectual disability (12 RR 67). Petetan scored 63% of the answers on the test\n\ncorrectly (12 RR 69). The score placed him within the range of those found\n\nincompetent to stand trial and below those found competent to stand trial (12 RR\n\n70).\n\n\n       Based on her examination, Petetan has limited capacity to understand the\n\ncriminal charges against him (12 RR 71). He does not have the ability to consult\n\nwith counsel (12 RR 73). She felt he would not be capable to testify because he\n\nbecomes stuck on one topic or loses attention quickly (12 RR 83). Based on all of\n\nher activity in the case, Seay did not believe Petetan was competent to stand trial\n\nbecause his intellectual disability was interfering with his ability to be competent\n\n(12 RR 88-89). She did not believe he was subject to having his competency\n\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\frestored due to his intellectual disability (12 RR 88, 148). Petetan rested (12 RR\n\n171).\n\n\n        Dr. Michael Pittman is a psychiatrist from Dallas (12 RR 172). He was\n\nappointed by the trial court to examine Petetan for competency (12 RR 174). He\n\nassessed Petetan in jail and reviewed various documents (12 RR 177). He did not\n\nadminister a written examination to Petetan (12 RR 199).\n\n\n        Pittman did not believe Petetan to be intellectually disabled, but did believe\n\nhis intellect was below average and that he was a “little low in the IQ department”\n\n(12 RR 185). After his assessment, Pittman believed Petetan competent for trial\n\n(12 RR 186, 196).\n\n\n        On September 23, 2012, Christopher Moutray, of the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment, interviewed Petetan with regard to the murder of his wife, Kimberly\n\nPetetan (12 RR 207). Petetan was given his Miranda warnings, which he appeared\n\nto understand (12 RR 211, 212). Petetan spoke with Moutray and another\n\ndetective about the events which had transpired the day of his wife’s death (12 RR\n\n215). During the interview, Petetan repeatedly told the detectives that Adrian\n\nMiller had killed Kimberly (12 RR 217). Petetan participated in a gunshot residue\n\ntest, but refused to provide a DNA sample (12 RR 220, 223). Upon his arrest,\n\nPetetan invoked his right to counsel (12 RR 226). The recorded interview of\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fPetetan in Bryan was played for the jury (12 RR 228, 61 RR SX C). The State\n\nrested (13 RR 15).\n\n\n      Seay was recalled by the defense (13 RR 16). She said that she believed\n\nPetetan was being honest with her during their three interviews (13 RR 22). After\n\nlistening to the State’s evidence, she still believed Petetan incompetent for trial (13\n\nRR 25).\n\n\n      Both sides closed on the issue of competency (13 RR 61). No objection was\n\nvoiced to the court’s charge (13 RR 12). The charge was read to the jury (13 RR\n\n62). Argument was presented (13 RR 70, 75, and 84). The jury returned a verdict\n\nfinding Petetan competent to stand trial (13 RR 94).\n\n\n                            B. Guilt or Innocence Phase\n\n\n      The indictment alleges Petetan killed Kimberly Petetan on September 23,\n\n2012, by shooting her with a firearm while in the course of committing burglary of\n\nKimberly Petetan, retaliation of Kimberly Petetan, and kidnapping of Kimberly\n\nPetetan and her daughter, A. W.1 (1 CR 44, 51 RR 25).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, at 6:30 pm in the evening, Waco Police Officer\n\nRebecca Diaz responded to a report of shots fired at The Landing apartment\n\n1\n  “A. W.” was a minor at the time of the offense and a pseudonym is used\nthroughout this brief. See TEX. R. APP. P. 9.10(a)(3).\n                                       - 13 -\n\fcomplex in Waco (51 RR 47). She and a fellow officer approached an apartment,\n\nknocked on the door, and opened the door when no one answered (51 RR 54).\n\nThey saw the body of a white female on the floor as well as bloodstains near the\n\nbody (51 RR 56). The victim had suffered multiple gunshot wounds (51 RR 56).\n\n\n      Diaz and her fellow officer searched for other victims or a suspect in the\n\napartment and found none (51 RR 57). There were no signs of forced entry into\n\nthe apartment (51 RR 58). The gunshot victim died by the time paramedics arrived\n\n(51 RR 64).\n\n\n      After speaking with a neighbor, Diaz learned the identity of the gunshot\n\nvictim as Kimberly Petetan (51 RR 66). Diaz also learned that the victim had a\n\nyoung daughter and Diaz was concerned because the child was not in the\n\napartment and her whereabouts were unknown (51 RR 67). While still at the\n\nscene, Diaz learned the child had been located in Bryan (51 RR 67).\n\n\n      Ashley Roy, an evidence technician with the Waco Police Department, went\n\nto the scene of shooting (51 RR 117). She saw a body with gunshot wounds (51\n\nRR 120). Roy found three .380 shell casings at the scene (51 RR 120-123). Inside\n\nthe apartment, she noticed blood stains on the four lowest stairs near the front door\n\n(51 RR 123). The bloodstains led her to believe the person was already wounded\n\nwhen they climbed the four stairs (51 RR 133). She found no bloodstains upstairs\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f(51 RR 139). There was no sign of a forced entry or struggle in the apartment (51\n\nRR 124-125). She recovered two cigarette butts and a cigar package outside the\n\napartment (51 RR 153).\n\n\n      Joyce Marek, a Waco Police Department crime scene technician, searched\n\nPetetan’s 1989 Suburban vehicle which had been seized by the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment (51 RR 164). She took photos of the vehicle and found what she\n\nthought to be bloodstains in the vehicle (51 RR 167). The vehicle contained\n\nnumerous papers belonging to Petetan (51 RR 178). She also found maps in the\n\nvehicle showing directions from Port Arthur to Waco and to McLennan County\n\nCommunity College (51 RR 188).\n\n\n      Drs. Chester Gwin and Allison Edgecombe, of the Southwestern Institute of\n\nForensic Sciences, performed an autopsy on the body of Kimberly Petetan (51 RR\n\n200-203). During the examination, they found evidence of two gunshot wounds\n\n(51 RR 206). The projectile from one of the wounds hit several major organs (51\n\nRR 220). Gwin testified that Kimberly Petetan died from multiple gunshot wounds\n\n(51 RR 224).\n\n\n      Lanelle Waley is a firearm and tool mark examiner with the Department of\n\nPublic Safety in Austin (51 RR 229). He examined the three shell casings found in\n\napartment and determined they were .380 Winchester cartridges (51 RR 235). All\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fof the casings had been fired from the same firearm which may have been a Bersa\n\nThunder Model .380 (51 RR 237-238). Waley explained that the Department will\n\nnot conduct a gunshot residue tests if the suspects hands were swabbed more than\n\nfour hours after a weapon was allegedly fired (51 RR 242).\n\n\n       Erin Casmus is a forensic scientist with the Department of Public Safety in\n\nWaco (51 RR 246). He examined evidence submitted in the case (51 RR 249). A\n\ncigarette butt at the scene of the shooting had DNA consistent with that of Kerrie\n\nMouton (51 RR 253). A bloodstain found on the shirt Petetan was wearing at the\n\ntime of his arrest contained DNA consistent with Petetan’s own DNA (51 RR 261).\n\n\n       Kristin Warmack is the older sister of A. W.2 and daughter of Kimberly\n\nPetetan (52 RR 7). She and her mother met Petetan’s brother at a brake repair shop\n\nin Waxahachie and he suggested Kimberly write to Petetan to share her story and\n\nGod’s love (52 RR 17-19). Her mother corresponded with Petetan in 2009 and\n\n2010 and eventually began to have romantic feelings toward him (52 RR 20).\n\nThey were married by proxy in September of 2010 with Warmack standing in for\n\nPetetan (52 RR 23). Petetan came to live with Kimberly and A. W. in April of\n\n2012 (52 RR 26).\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Warmack and “A. W.” do not have the same last name.\n                                     - 16 -\n\f      In August of 2012, Kimberly was planning to move to Port Arthur to be with\n\nPetetan (52 RR 28). She then decided to stay in Waco and rented an apartment at\n\nThe Landing apartment complex (52 RR 33). Kimberly eventually moved to Port\n\nArthur in early September of 2012 to be with Petetan (52 RR 34).\n\n\n      On September 13, 2012, Warmack received a voice message from A. W.\n\ninforming her that Petetan was threatening their mother with a knife (52 RR 36).\n\nThe following day, her mother decided to leave Port Arthur and move back to\n\nWaco (52 RR 37). Her mother told her that in view of Petetan’s assault in front of\n\nA. W., she was leaving Petetan and intended to divorce him (52 RR 38).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, A. W. called Warmack from a convenience store in\n\nConroe and asked her to come pick her up (52 RR 42). On the way, Warmack\n\nreceived a call from her mother’s apartment manager in Waco informing her that\n\nher mother had been shot and was dead (52 RR 43). Warmack called 911 to report\n\nher sister’s call for help and upon investigation by the police; she was told A. W.\n\nwas not at the convenience store (52 RR 44).\n\n\n      Later in the day on September 23, 2012, Warmack received a telephone call\n\nfrom Kerrie Mouton informing her that the police in Bryan had A. W. (52 RR 45).\n\nShe drove to Bryan that night and picked up her younger sister, A. W. (52 RR 46).\n\nA. W. now lives with her (52 RR 7).\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\f       Warmack went to her mother’s apartment in Waco a couple of days later to\n\npick up some clothing for A. W. (52 RR 48). While at the apartment, she found\n\nher mother’s purse in the dishwasher (52 RR 49).\n\n\n       On September 13, 2012, Ryan Kidwell, of the Port Arthur Police\n\nDepartment, responded to a domestic disturbance call (52 RR 83). Kimberly\n\nPetetan told Kidwell that Petetan assaulted her when she asked him to stop\n\nsmoking in the apartment because her daughter has asthma (52 RR 85). She said\n\nPetetan had thrown her to the floor and held a kitchen knife close to her (52 RR\n\n86). While holding the knife close to her, Petetan said “I could kill you, do you\n\nwant to die in front of your child?” (52 RR 88).\n\n\n       Petetan left the apartment by the time Kidwell arrived (52 RR 87).\n\nKimberly told the officer she wanted to file assault charges against Petetan and she\n\nknew it would be a felony since he used a knife during the assault (52 RR 90). She\n\nalso told the officer she was leaving Port Arthur and moving back to Waco (52 RR\n\n93).\n\n\n       On September 23, 2012, Jackie Musgrove was staying at a motel in Waco\n\n(52 RR 102). Petetan approached him and asked him to rent a room in Musgrove’s\n\nname for Petetan in return for ten dollars (52 RR 104). Musgrove did as asked and\n\nwas paid by Petetan (52 RR 108).\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\f      On September 23, 2012, Cornelius Jefferson was at The Landing apartment\n\ncomplex in Waco washing clothes (52 RR 121). He was approached by a man\n\nwho asked him to knock on an apartment door (52 RR 124). Jefferson agreed to do\n\nso because he thought it was a joke or prank (52 RR 124). He knocked on the door\n\nand two women looked out the window (52 RR 125). The man who asked him to\n\nknock was crouched down behind Jefferson (52 RR 126). Eventually one of the\n\nwomen opened the door of the apartment and the man who had been crouched\n\ndown behind Jefferson ran into the apartment (52 RR 127). Jefferson identified\n\nPetetan as the man who asked him to knock on the door and eventually ran into the\n\napartment (52 RR 132).\n\n\n      Nichlos Lampkin previously lived in the same apartment complex as\n\nKimberly and A. W. on Purvis Street in Waco (52 RR 147). Petetan later moved\n\ninto the apartment and frequently argued with Kimberly (52 RR 153). Sometimes\n\nwhen Petetan was angry, he would tell Lampkin in reference to Kimerbly “man,\n\nI’m going to kill that bitch” (52 RR 154). Petetan and Kimberly eventually moved\n\nfrom the complex (52 RR 158).\n\n\n      Morris Evans knew Petetan and Kimberly when they lived in an apartment\n\ncomplex on Purvis Street in Waco (52 RR 165). Evans recalled an occasion when\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 19 -\n\fPetetan accused him of sleeping with Kimberly (52 RR 168). Evans remembered\n\nPetetan saying “I’m going to kill the bitch” (52 RR 169).\n\n\n      Charles Gatlin was an inmate at the McLennan County Jail with Petetan\n\nfollowing Petetan’s arrest for murder (52 RR 179). One morning in jail, Petetan\n\nbumped into Gatlin and Gatlin said “excuse me” to which Petetan replied “I killed\n\nmy wife and I will kill you” (52 RR 179). On another occasion, Petetan asked\n\nGatlin if the authorities could match a fingerprint from a gun based on a DNA\n\nsample (52 RR 181). Petetan asked Gatlin to explain a ballistics report and\n\nwhether it meant the police had a gun (52 RR 182).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, Officer Crystal O’Rear, of the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment, received a call of a possible kidnapping (53 RR 7). Within ten\n\nminutes she saw a vehicle matching the description of that involved in the possible\n\nkidnapping (53 RR 21). She stopped the vehicle which was occupied by four\n\npeople, Petetan, A. W., Adrian Miller, and Kerrie Mouton (53 RR 8, 11). Backup\n\nofficers arrived, the occupants were separated, and O’Rear had an opportunity to\n\nspeak with A. W. about what had happened to her mother in Waco (53 RR 13, 15).\n\nWhile stopped on the roadway, Mouton called A. W.’s older sister in Conroe and\n\ntold her A. W. was in Bryan and safe in the presence of law enforcement officers\n\n(53 RR 25).\n\n\n                                       - 20 -\n\f       At 9:43 pm on September 23, 2012, Officer Lance Matthews, of the Bryan\n\nPolice Department, received a call that his assistance was needed in conducting\n\nsome interviews (51 RR 72). Those to be interviewed had knowledge of a murder\n\nin Waco (51 RR 73). They had been stopped in a vehicle traveling through Bryan\n\n(51 RR 73). The individuals to be interviewed were A. W., Kerrie Mouton, Adrian\n\nMiller, and Petetan (51 RR 76). Matthews first obtained some information from a\n\nWaco Police Department detective before conducting the interviews (51 RR 77).\n\n\n       Matthews first interviewed A. W., the daughter of Kimberly Petetan (51 RR\n\n79). She had no difficulty describing the events leading to her mother’s shooting\n\n(51 RR 81).\n\n\n       Matthew next spoke with Miller (51 RR 82). Miller was cooperative,\n\nprovided a DNA sample, and took a gunshot residue test (51 RR 84, 86). After the\n\ninterview, Matthews did not believe Miller was involved in the shooting (51 RR\n\n87).\n\n\n       Mouton was interviewed next (51 RR 87). He was cooperative, provided a\n\nDNA sample, and took a gunshot residue test (51 RR 88). After interviewing\n\nMouton, Matthews did not believe him to be a suspect in the shooting (51 RR 90).\n\n\n       Petetan was the last person interviewed (51 RR 91). He was cooperative and\n\ntook a gunshot residue test (51 RR 92). He refused to provide a DNA sample (51\n                                       - 21 -\n\fRR 92). At the conclusion of the interviews, Matthews arrested Petetan for the\n\nmurder of Kimberly Petetan based on a McLennan County arrest warrant (51 RR\n\n92). Miller and Mouton were released and A. W. was turned over to her older\n\nsister (51 RR 93, 95).\n\n\n      Adrian Miller and Petetan grew up together in Port Arthur (53 RR 34). In\n\nthe early morning of September 23, 2012, Miller saw Petetan at a store in Port\n\nArthur (53 RR 36). Petetan told him he was going to Waco to buy some drugs and\n\nhe would give Miller an ounce of crack cocaine and some money if he would drive\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 37). Kerrie Mouton agreed to come along in order to\n\n“watch Miller’s back” (53 RR 40).\n\n\n      On the way to Waco, Petetan had a gun which he placed in the hood\n\ncompartment of his Suburban (53 RR 41). The threesome arrived in Waco about\n\nnoon and went to a motel (53 RR 43). Petetan paid a man to rent a room for them\n\n(53 RR 45).\n\n\n      Petetan left the motel in his Suburban without Miller or Mouton (53 RR 52).\n\nWhen Petetan returned to the motel, he was driving Kimberly’s truck which was\n\nalso occupied by Kimberly and A. W. (53 RR 52). Petetan told Miller and Mouton\n\nto get in the bed of the truck and they all drove to Kimberly’s apartment complex\n\n(53 RR 54). Miller noticed Petetan’s vehicle was at the complex (53 RR 55).\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\f      They entered Kimberly’s apartment (53 RR 56). Miller and Mouton stayed\n\ndownstairs and watched television for two hours (53 RR 56). Petetan and\n\nKimberly went upstairs and Miller never heard them arguing (53 RR 56). When\n\nPetetan and Kimberly came downstairs, Kimberly told Miller where he could find\n\nsomething to eat in the kitchen (53 RR 57).\n\n\n      As Kimberly was trying to walk out the front door, Petetan slammed the\n\ndoor shut and struck her with his fist (53 RR 57). Petetan then produced a pistol\n\nand shot Kimberly multiple times (53 RR 59). Miller testified that Mouton ran out\n\nof the apartment after the first shot and A. W. did so after the second shot (53 RR\n\n59). Miller believed Petetan shot Kimberly four times and he saw her fall to the\n\nfloor in the apartment (53 RR 60).\n\n\n      Miller and Petetan left the apartment and got in Petetan’s vehicle which was\n\nalready occupied in the back seat by Mouton and A. W. (53 RR 61). Miller\n\ntestified he got in the vehicle to drive because he was concerned Petetan would\n\nhurt A. W. or Mouton (53 RR 62). Miller stated that no one told A. W. and\n\nMouton to get in Petetan’s Suburban, they simply did so after the shooting of\n\nKimberly in the apartment (53 RR 90).\n\n\n      With Miller driving, they stopped for gas (53 RR 63). Petetan gave Miller\n\nmoney to purchase gasoline after Petetan had rubbed the money on his hands (53\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fRR 63). Petetan followed Miller into the gas station and Miller was not able to\n\nalert the clerk of the shooting in Waco (53 RR 65).\n\n\n      In the vehicle, A. W. asked if her mother was dead (53 RR 68). Miller told\n\nher “no,” and Petetan said nothing (53 RR 68). Miller never heard Petetan\n\napologize to A. W. for killing her mother (53 RR 68).\n\n\n      After stopping at a store in Bryan, Miller intentionally engaged in aggressive\n\ndriving in an effort to attract the attention of a nearby police officer (53 RR 70,\n\n72). When the officer approached the vehicle, Miller told the officer that he\n\nneeded to talk to the officer in private (53 RR 72). Petetan told Miller to only talk\n\nto the officer in the presence of Petetan (53 RR 72).\n\n\n      When the officer took Miller to the rear of the vehicle, Miller told him what\n\nhad happed in Waco (53 RR 73). Miller denied killing Kimberly or knowing of\n\nPetetan’s intent to do so (53 RR 77).\n\n\n      In hindsight, Miller believes Petetan was trying to set him up or frame him\n\nfor the murder of Kimberly (53 RR 74). He recalled that once they were on\n\nHighway 6 headed toward Bryan from Waco, Petetan had Miller pull over so he\n\ncould dispose of the pistol and piece of pizza Miller had taken from Kimberly’s\n\napartment (53 RR 66). Miller believed Petetan was trying to set him up with DNA\n\nfrom the pizza, or the pizza wrapper at the murder scene, and connect him to the\n                                         - 24 -\n\fmurder weapon (53 RR 66). Miller also recalled that a couple of weeks before\n\nshooting, Petetan offered him a rock of crack cocaine if he would call Kimberly\n\nand cuss her out on the phone (53 RR 91). Miller agreed to do so and he believes\n\nthe call was recorded for possible later use by Petetan in implicating him the\n\nmurder of Kimberly (53 RR 91).\n\n\n        Kerrie Mouton first met Petetan in 2012 in Port Arthur (53 RR 98). Petetan\n\nasked Mouton to come with him on trip to Waco to buy drugs (53 RR 101).\n\nPetetan promised to give Mouton some drugs if he would come along on the trip\n\n(53 RR 101).\n\n\n        Miller came with them on the trip to Waco (53 RR 102). When they arrived\n\nin Waco, they checked into a motel (53 RR 106). Petetan left the motel in his\n\nvehicle and later returned in a truck occupied by Kimberly and A. W. (53 RR 108,\n\n109).\n\n\n        Mouton and Miller got in the bed of Kimberly’s truck and she drove the five\n\nof them to her apartment (53 RR 110). Upon arriving, Kimberly opened the door\n\nand they all entered (53 RR 111, 131). While he and Miller were downstairs,\n\nMouton heard Kimberly upstairs say “fuck you Carnell, if you are going to kill me,\n\nkill me” (53 RR 113).\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\f      When Kimberly and Petetan came downstairs, she tried to unlock and open\n\nthe front door, but Petetan pushed her away and into a wall (53 RR 117). When\n\nKimberly pushed Petetan, he shot her multiple times with a handgun (53 RR 118).\n\n\n      After the shooting, Mouton and A. W. ran out the back door of the apartment\n\nand jumped into Petetan’s vehicle (53 RR 121). Mouton intended to drive the two\n\nof them away, but Miller and Petetan came outside and entered the vehicle before\n\nhe could do so (53 RR 121). Mouton did not force A. W. to get in the vehicle with\n\nhim; she simply followed him to the vehicle after the shooting of her mother (53\n\nRR 135).\n\n\n      The four of them drove away with Miller driving, Petetan in the front\n\npassenger seat, and Mouton and A. W. in the rear seat (53 RR 122). While they\n\nwere traveling, Mouton was in fear for his life and A. W. was crying and asking for\n\nher older sister (53 RR 124). Eventually, they were stopped by the police in Bryan\n\nand Mouton told the police the details of the shooting in Waco (53 RR 125, 127).\n\n\n      A. W. was eleven years old at the time of trial in April of 2014 (53 RR 143).\n\nAt one time, she and her mother lived in an apartment on Purvis Street in Waco (53\n\nRR 145). While living on Purvis, Petetan moved in with them (53 RR 145).\n\nPetetan would yell at her mother and say bad things to her (53 RR 147). She and\n\nher mother then moved to The Landing apartment complex in Waco (53 RR 148).\n\n                                      - 26 -\n\fAfter moving to The Landing, her mother told her that they were moving to Port\n\nArthur to be with Petetan because that was where he was on parole (53 RR 150).\n\n\n      After moving to Port Arthur, her mother and Petetan fought and her mother\n\nwould cry (53 RR 151). She recalled an argument in the apartment one night when\n\nPetetan refused her mother’s request to smoke outside rather than in the apartment\n\nbecause she has asthma (53 RR 155). Petetan pushed her mother to the floor and\n\nshe was crying (53 RR 156). Petetan retrieved a knife from the kitchen, put the\n\nknife behind her mother, and asked “if she wanted to die in front of A. W.” (53 RR\n\n158). Her mother ran to the bathroom and called the authorities concerning the\n\nassault and Petetan then cut himself on the stomach with the knife (53 RR 160).\n\nShe saw Petetan call the police and then leave the apartment before the police\n\narrived (53 RR 161). The next day, her mother told her they were leaving Port\n\nArthur and moving back to Waco (53 RR 163).\n\n\n      Her mother died on a Sunday after they had attended church and talked\n\nabout Heaven (53 RR 168). They were at home and heard a knock on the door (53\n\nRR 172). Looking out the window, they could tell it was a stranger knocking (53\n\nRR 173). When her mother opened the door, Petetan pushed his way into the\n\napartment without her mother inviting him in (53 RR 174). Petetan pulled a gun\n\nfrom his pocket and waved the gun around the apartment (53 RR 175). Petetan\n\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\ftold her mother to get dressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). Petetan told her\n\nmother they were going to Port Arthur and she was “going to tell the cops what\n\nhappened” (53 RR 177).\n\n\n      The three of them got into her mother’s truck and her mother was driving\n\n(53 RR 177). Petetan still had the gun in his pocket while in the truck (53 RR\n\n178). Petetan directed her mother to drive to a motel in Waco (53 RR 179). Once\n\nthey arrived at the motel, Petetan told her mother to honk the horn of the truck (53\n\nRR 180). Two men came out of a room and got in the bed of the truck (53 RR\n\n180). She did not know the men (53 RR 180).\n\n\n      They left the motel and returned to her mother’s apartment (53 RR 183).\n\nOnce at the apartment, everyone went inside (53 RR 184). The two men stayed\n\ndownstairs and her mother and Petetan went upstairs (53 RR 184). While upstairs,\n\nshe saw Petetan try to kiss her mother (53 RR 185). Petetan told A. W. to go to her\n\nown bedroom and leave them alone (53 RR 186).\n\n\n      Everyone went downstairs and her mother was washing dishes (53 RR 187).\n\nThe men were outside on a patio smoking cigarettes (53 RR 187). When they\n\ncame back into to the apartment, one of the men put a pizza in the microwave oven\n\n(53 RR 188).\n\n\n\n                                       - 28 -\n\f      When her mother tried to open the front door, Petetan ran toward the door,\n\nshut it, and pushed her mother into a wall (53 RR 190). Petetan told her mother to\n\nstand on the stairs, that it was “time for her dust away,” and then he shot her three\n\ntimes (53 RR 191). Her mother fell to the floor and “flopped around like a fish”\n\n(53 RR 192).\n\n\n      The younger of two other men in the apartment grabbed her and took her out\n\nthe back door of the apartment (53 RR 192). He told her that everything would be\n\nokay (53 RR 193). When they briefly went back into the apartment, she saw\n\nPetetan grabbing all of the cellphones in the apartment (53 RR 193).\n\n\n      All four of them then got in Petetan’s white Suburban and left (53 RR 195).\n\nAt one point, they stopped on the road by some trees and she saw Petetan wrap the\n\ngun used to shoot her mother in a sheet and then throw the sheet over a fence and\n\ninto the woods (53 RR 198). After the Suburban was stopped by the police in\n\nBryan, she told the police what had happened in Waco and her older sister then\n\npicked her up in Bryan and took her to Conroe (53 RR 201). The State rested (53\n\nRR 224).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, Chasity Hamilton was working as a clerk at the Big\n\nGas Truck Stop in Bryan (54 RR 15). Petetan came into the store and was acting\n\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fin a nervous manner (54 RR 18). She obtained a description of his vehicle as well\n\nas the license plate number and called the police after he left the store (54 RR 19).\n\n\n      Ricki Elliot met Petetan when he was living with Kimberly in an apartment\n\non Purvis Street him Waco (54 RR 22). Her apartment was next door and she\n\nnever heard Petetan and Kimberly arguing in their apartment (54 RR 23).\n\n\n      Petetan testified his relationship started with Kimberly while he was a\n\nprisoner serving a 20 year sentence at the Ellis Unit of the TDCJ-ID (54 RR 31).\n\nThey corresponded with one another and she would visit him in prison with her\n\ndaughter, A. W. (54 RR 35). They eventually decided to marry and were married\n\nby proxy 18 months before he was paroled from prison (54 RR 37-38).\n\n\n      He was in prison for five convictions, three aggravated assaults and two\n\nattempted murders (54 RR 84). He served 19 years and 8 months of a 20 year\n\nsentence before he was released on parole (54 RR 84).\n\n\n      After being released on parole, he lived with Kimberly and A. W. in an\n\napartment on Purvis Street in Waco (54 RR 40). He never threatened to kill his\n\nwife while living on Purvis Street (54 RR 43). They eventually moved to an\n\napartment at The Landing in Waco because they were having problems with the\n\nneighbors on Purvis Street (54 RR 44).\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f      He denied assaulting Kimberly in Port Arthur (54 RR 46). Rather, after she\n\ndisapproved of him going to a recording studio, she slapped him, and then cut him\n\non the chest with a knife (54 RR 49-50). He reported her assault of him to the\n\npolice (54 RR 50).\n\n\n      On the day of Kimberly’s death, Petetan came to Waco from Port Arthur to\n\npick up some property and return some money to Kimberly (54 RR 52). Miller\n\nand Mouton came with him because he did not know the way from Port Arthur to\n\nWaco (54 RR 52). Once they arrived, he rented a motel room for Miller and\n\nMouton (54 RR 55).\n\n\n      Petetan drove to Kimberly’s apartment and she let him come inside (54 RR\n\n57). He denied crouching down behind a man and rushing into her apartment\n\nwhen the door was opened (54 RR 57). He denied having a gun in the apartment\n\n(54 RR 123). He, Kimberly, and A. W., drove to the motel to pick up Miller and\n\nMouton (54 RR 60). Before they went back to Kimberly’s apartment, they stopped\n\nfor Kimberly to buy some marijuana (54 RR 63).\n\n\n      Once they returned to Kimberly’s apartment, Pertetan and Kimberly went\n\nupstairs and Mouton and Miller remained downstairs (54 RR 63). Petetan did not\n\nhave a gun, but Miller had brought a gun from Port Arthur for protection because\n\nthis was his first trip to Waco (54 RR 63).\n\n                                        - 31 -\n\f      Eventually, Petetan and Kimberly went downstairs (54 RR 65). She became\n\nupset when she saw Miller eating her food (54 RR 66). Kimberly and Miller began\n\nto argue (54 RR 68). While Miller and Kimberly were near the front door, Petetan\n\nheard Miller say “fuck this bitch” and then saw Miller shoot Kimberly (54 RR 71).\n\nWhen Petetan tried to call 911, Miller pointed the gun at him and took his phone\n\n(54 RR 73).\n\n\n      The four of them left with Miller driving and A. W. pleading with Petetan\n\nnot to let Miller hurt her (54 RR 73). Petetan only got into the vehicle to protect A.\n\nW. from Miller (54 RR 144). Miller wanted to throw A. W. out of the vehicle\n\nwhile traveling down the highway or take her to Houston and kill her (54 RR 76).\n\nWhen they stopped at a truck stop in Bryan, Petetan told the clerk that his daughter\n\nwas in the vehicle, she had been kidnapped, and his wife had been shot in Waco\n\n(54 RR 77).\n\n\n      Eventually, Petetan’s vehicle was stopped because of the information he\n\ngave to the clerk at the truck stop (54 RR 78). When an officer approached the\n\nvehicle, Petetan told her that Miller had kidnapped his daughter and shot his wife\n\n(54 RR 79). When he was interrogated at the police station, Petetan repeated that\n\nMiller had kidnapped his daughter and shot his wife (54 RR 80). The defense\n\nrested (54 RR 156)\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\f      In rebuttal, the State called Michael Tovar who was an inmate at the\n\nMcLennan County Jail with Petetan (54 RR 158). In jail, Petetan referred to\n\nKimberly as “that bitch” (54 RR 162). Petetan told Tovar that he shot Kimberly\n\n“boom-boom-boom” (54 RR 166). Petetan said he was willing to talk about the\n\nmurder because the State would be unable to charge him due to his “mental state”\n\n(54 RR 168).\n\n\n      The State rested on rebuttal and both sides closed (54 RR 173). No\n\nobjections were voiced to the court’s charge and it was read to the jury (54 RR\n\n174, 176). Argument was presented (54 RR 188, 197, and 215). The jury found\n\nPetetan guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment (54 RR 224).\n\n\n                               C. Punishment Phase\n\n\n      Ramona Pitre is a public school teacher in Port Arthur (55 RR 21). In 1989,\n\nPetetan was in her in-school suspension program (55 RR 26). He was angry,\n\nresistant, and disruptive in class (55 RR 27). On May 24, 1989, Petetan threw a\n\nlunch tray full of food at her when she tried to make him sit in the correct seat (55\n\nRR 29). She does not believe Petetan is mentally intellectually disabled (55 RR\n\n31). She believed he cannot follow rules and misbehaves (55 RR 31). In twenty\n\nfive years of teaching, she has never had a student with intellectual disability,\n\nmental problems, or mental illness in one of her classes (55 RR 32).\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\f      Edward Cockrell is with the Jefferson County Juvenile Probation\n\nDepartment (55 RR 36). In 1990, Petetan was placed in intensive supervision\n\njuvenile probation for assaulting Pitre and the offense of criminal mischief against\n\nanother person (55 RR 41). Petetan did not comply with the terms of probation\n\nand was eventually committed to the Brownwood State School (55 RR 49).\n\nPetetan returned to Port Arthur on juvenile parole and continued engaging in\n\ncriminal conduct (55 RR 50).\n\n\n      Eventually, it was decided to pursue certification for prosecution as an adult\n\nafter Petetan shot Fredrick Nico with a gun in March of 1992 (55 RR 50, 51, and\n\n55). Cockrell’s certification analysis was admitted into evidence (55 RR 53, 62\n\nRR SX 133). When Petetan was 16 years of age, an IQ test administered yielded a\n\nscore of 64 on a child’s test and 74 on an adult test (55 RR 65, 62 RR SX 133). A\n\ndoctor described Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled in connection with\n\ntesting conducted relative to the certification proceeding (55 RR 66). Eventually,\n\nCockrell recommended Petetan be certified and tried as an adult for various\n\noffenses he committed while under 17 years of age (55 RR 72). He was certified\n\nto stand trial as an adult (55 RR 82).\n\n\n      Records from the former Texas Youth Commission regarding Petetan were\n\nadmitted into evidence (55 RR 87, 62 RR SX 128). Those records reflect an IQ\n\n\n                                         - 34 -\n\fscore of 61 for Petetan when he was admitted to TYC at the age of 15 in 1991 (62\n\nRR SX 128).\n\n\n        The juvenile certification proceedings related to Petetan were admitted into\n\nevidence and published to the jury (55 RR 82, 62 RR SX 130). The exhibit reflects\n\nPetetan’s date of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n        Leonard Cucolo testified that Petetan was received by the Brownwood State\n\nSchool in 1991 after his juvenile probation for burglary was revoked (55 RR 84,\n\n87). He was at the Brownwood School for four months before returning to Port\n\nArthur on juvenile parole (55 RR 93). While at the Brownwood School, Petetan\n\nwas diagnosed as mildly intellectually disabled (55 RR 103).\n\n\n        Port Arthur Police Department Officer Brian Broussard responded to a\n\nshooting report on March 21, 1992 (55 RR 107-108). He spoke with the victim,\n\nFredrick Nico, who told him that Petetan had shot him with a gun (55 RR 110).\n\nPetetan shot Nico twice, and then tried to shoot him in the head, but the gun\n\nmisfired (55 RR 111-112). Nico related the shooting was unprovoked (55 RR\n\n112).\n\n\n        Petetan was arrested for the shooting of Nico (55 RR 113). When he was 16\n\nyears of age, Petetan was certified to stand trial as an adult and received a 20 year\n\nsentence for the attempted murder of Nico (55 RR 115).\n                                        - 35 -\n\f      On March 21, 1992, Fredrick Nico, was at Petetan’s house in Port Arthur\n\ndrinking beer in the backyard (55 RR 124). Nico was carrying a pistol for\n\nprotection (55 RR 122). When Nico put the pistol on a table, Petetan grabbed it\n\nand ran to an alley (55 RR 126). When Petetan returned from the alley, he pointed\n\nthe pistol at Nico and shot him twice (55 RR 128). Nico denied that Petetan tried\n\nto shoot him a third time in the head (55 RR 129).\n\n\n      Nico later learned that Petetan was prosecuted for his attempted murder (55\n\nRR 131). Nico has known Petetan for 25 years and does not consider him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (55 RR 134).\n\n\n      Judge Vi McGinnis previously served as a Justice of the Peace in Jefferson\n\nCounty (55 RR 150). His duties included giving warnings to arrested juveniles and\n\nreviewing any written statements given by juveniles to police before they were\n\nsigned by the juvenile (55 RR 153). Following his arrest for the attempted murder\n\nof Nico, McGinnis gave Petetan his statutory warnings (55 RR 156). McGinnis\n\nalso reviewed the statement Petetan provided to the police concerning the shooting\n\nof Nico (55 RR 157). The statement reflected Petetan shot Nico because Nico had\n\npreviously beat him, Nico had laughed at Petetan’s mother, and Nico laughed\n\nwhen he learned that Petetan’s friend “Pee Wee” had been killed (55 RR 159).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\f        Officer Tony Barker, of the Beaumont Police Department, responded to a\n\ncall from the Jefferson County Juvenile Detention Center in April of 1992 (55 RR\n\n165). He spoke with a teacher at the Center who reported that Petetan had\n\nphysically assaulted her (55 RR 166). Barker arrested Petetan for assaulting the\n\nteacher (55 RR 168).\n\n\n        Raffiel Dugas testified that when he was 15 or 16 year old, he fought with\n\nPetetan inside a club in Port Arthur (55 RR 173, 177). Petetan hit Dugas with a\n\nchair rendering Dugas unconscious (55 RR 179). Petetan then proceeded to beat\n\nDugas with the chair while he was unconscious on the floor (55 RR 180). Dugas\n\nsustained multiple injuries and was in the hospital for a week (55 RR 180-182).\n\nHe later learned that Petetan went to prison for assaulting him with a chair (55 RR\n\n180).\n\n\n        Max Wolgast, of the Port Arthur Police Department, responded to a shooting\n\non January 14, 1993 (55 RR 186). Victor Loeb was shot in a drive-by shooting\n\nwhile walking in his neighborhood (55 RR 187). He sustained three gunshot\n\nwounds (55 RR 188). Petetan was arrested for the shooting three days later and the\n\nhandgun used in the shooting was found in his mother’s home (55 RR 189).\n\nPetetan was sent to prison for shooting Loeb (55 RR 190).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\f      Kari Biddix previously lived in Port Arthur (55 RR 192). She recalled an\n\nincident when she heard gunshots outside her home and saw an older man limping\n\nand grabbing his side on the sidewalk (55 RR 193). She approached the man and\n\nhe said “I’ve been shot” (55 RR 196). After learning the man’s name, she and her\n\nsister drove to Loeb’s house and told his wife that her husband had been shot (55\n\nRR 197).\n\n\n      On June 28, 1992, Corey Mendoza was a detention officer in the Jefferson\n\nCounty Jail (55 RR 202). He responded to a fire set in a cell occupied by Petetan\n\nand another inmate (55 RR 203). After Mendoza extinguished the fire, Petetan\n\nsaid he would start another fire if he was not moved to a different cell (55 RR 204).\n\nMendoza later received a report that Petetan was throwing water on other inmates\n\nas they walked by his cell (55 RR 206). Jail records reflect Petetan’s date of birth\n\nas February 7, 1976 (55 RR 203).\n\n\n      On February 9, 1993, while working as a jailer in the Jefferson County Jail,\n\nMark Beadle responded to an inmate who had been burned when Petetan threw hot\n\nwater on him (55 RR 210-211). His records reflect Petetan assaulted another\n\ninmate in jail on May 28, 1993 (55 RR 213).\n\n\n      The pen packets from Petetan’s five prior felony convictions were admitted\n\ninto evidence (55 RR 217, 62 RR SX 131). The packets reflect that on July 7,\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\f1993, he pleded guilty to five felony offenses committed while he was a 16 year\n\nold juvenile (62 RR SX 131). Those offenses were two attempted murders and\n\nthree aggravated assaults (62 RR SX 131). Pursuant to a plea bargain, he received\n\ntwo 20 year sentences and three 10 year sentences to be served concurrently (62\n\nRR SX 131). He was received at the Department of Corrections when he was 17\n\nyears of age on August 27, 1993 (62 RR SX 131). Prison records reflected his IQ\n\ntesting was scored at 69 with a notation he was expelled following the eighth grade\n\n(62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Joseph Blanton was previously employed as a prison guard at the Ferguson\n\nUnit of TDCJ (55 RR 230). On December 5, 1993, Petetan was involved in a\n\nfracas in the dayroom with several other offenders (55 RR 233). He was\n\neventually found guilty in an administrative hearing of assaulting four other\n\ninmates (55 RR 240).\n\n\n      Darrel Musgrove was previously employed as a prison guard at the Ferguson\n\nUnit of TDCJ (55 RR 248). On February 24, 1994, Petetan assaulted him by\n\nstriking him in the chest with his elbow (55 RR 250).\n\n\n      Gilbert Mercado is a former prison guard from the McConnell Unit of TDCJ\n\n(55 RR 256). On April 5, 1995, Mercado saw Petetan in a fight with another\n\ninmate and repeatedly strike the other inmate with his fist (55 RR 259).\n\n                                       - 39 -\n\f       Billy Jordan previously worked at the Ferguson Unit of TDCJ as a prison\n\nguard (56 RR 6). On July 24, 1994, he responded to screams from a cell occupied\n\nby Petetan and Christopher Robinson (56 RR 7). Robinson was covered in blood\n\nand had injuries to his face and head (56 RR 9). Robinson was holding a sock\n\nwhich contained a padlock (56 RR 9). Petetan had no injuries (56 RR 9). Petetan\n\nwas administratively charged with attacking another inmate with a weapon (56 RR\n\n11).\n\n\n       James Simmons previously worked as a prison guard at the Clements Unit of\n\nTDCJ (56 RR 19). On June 3, 1995, Petetan approached Simmons and asked to be\n\nhis boyfriend (56 RR 19). Petetan told Simmons that he loved him and wanted to\n\nlive with him when he was released from prison (56 RR 20). Petetan was\n\nadministratively charged with soliciting an officer (56 RR 20).\n\n\n       Kellie Dossett previously worked as a prison guard at the McConnell Unit of\n\nTDCJ (56 RR 26). On August 25, 1995, Petetan yelled at Dossett and threw a\n\nliquid on him because Petetan was not allowed to participate in recreation (56 RR\n\n27, 30). Petetan was administratively charged with assaulting an officer (56 RR\n\n30).\n\n\n       On February 25, 1996, prison guard Jody Munn searched Petetan’s cell at\n\nthe Coffield Unit for contraband (56 RR 34-35). When Petetan returned to his cell,\n\n                                       - 40 -\n\fhe found Munn inside his cell and he threated to “kick her ass” (56 RR 37).\n\nPetetan was administratively charged with threatening an officer (56 RR 38).\n\n\n       Morris Lee was Petetan’s principal in elementary school (56 RR 44).\n\nPetetan was frequently sent to Lee’s office because he did not follow school rules\n\n(56 RR 45). According to Lee, Petetan had no mental disabilities other than being\n\nhard headed (56 RR 51).\n\n\n       Speedy Bryant has served a sentence for aggravated robbery since 1993 (56\n\nRR 63). On February 28, 1994, he and Petetan were cellmates at the Ferguson\n\nUnit of TDCJ (56 RR 64). Petetan sexually assaulted him in their cell after they\n\nhad been cellmates for a week (56 RR 65). When Bryant reported the sexual\n\nassault to a guard, Petetan and his friends jumped on Bryant and beat him (56 RR\n\n67).\n\n\n       In January of 2004, Concepcion Rosas and Petetan were cellmates at the\n\nEllis Unit of TDCJ (56 RR 74). One afternoon after they had been cellmates for\n\ntwo weeks, Petetan sexually assaulted Rosas in their cell (56 RR 77).\n\n\n       Daniel Gunter was incarcerated at the McConnell Unit of TDCJ in 1995 (56\n\nRR 83). Gunter overheard Petetan tell his cellmate that he wanted a sexual\n\nrelationship with Gunter (56 RR 87). One afternoon, Gunter was knocked\n\nunconscious in his cell (56 RR 92). When he regained consciousness, he was in\n                                       - 41 -\n\fPetetan’s cell with his pants pulled down and Petetan sexually assaulting him while\n\nholding a shank to Gunter’s throat (56 RR 92-94). Gunter reported the incident to\n\na guard (56 RR 96). The State rested on punishment (56 RR 99).\n\n\n        Ophelia Ortiz is Petetan’s mother (56 RR 107). He is the youngest of her\n\nchildren (56 RR 109). Petetan’s father was both intellectually disabled and crazy\n\n(56 RR 109). While a child, Petetan was physically abused by his father (56 RR\n\n129).\n\n\n        As an infant, Petetan would constantly cry and pitch a fit (56 RR 112-113).\n\nHe would break his baby bottles (56 RR 112). His temper tantrums started as a\n\nbaby and have never subsided (56 RR 121).\n\n\n        Petetan has wet the bed since childhood and still does so (56 RR 114). He\n\nwas slow as a child and his mother had to repeatedly tell him to bathe (56 RR 115).\n\nHe was unable to take care of himself as a child and unable to tie his shoes (56 RR\n\n116). As a child, he was unable to dress himself or brush his teeth (56 RR 116).\n\nHe did not follow her directions (56 RR 118).\n\n\n        She had to walk with him to school because if he went by himself, he would\n\nget lost or go the wrong way (56 RR 117). He did not do his school homework (56\n\nRR 118). She could never send him to the store because he could not remember\n\n\n\n                                        - 42 -\n\fwhat he was to purchase (56 RR 171). He never learned to make change when\n\npurchasing an item (56 RR 171).\n\n\n      After his best childhood friend, “Pee Wee,” died, his nervousness and\n\ndepression increased (56 RR 120). Petetan had no interest in television or games\n\nas a child (56 RR 122). He would simply sit on the floor or go walking by himself\n\nwithout first telling his mother where he was going (56 RR 122). He was\n\ncommitted to a psychiatric hospital at age 15 before he went to the Brownwood\n\nState School (56 RR 128).\n\n\n      Petetan was never able to get a driver license because he was unable to pass\n\nthe written portion of the test (56 RR 123). After he left prison, he could not take\n\ncare of himself (56 RR 124). Her daughter would clean and wash his clothes\n\nbecause he could not operate a washing machine (56 RR 124). He was unable to\n\nfigure out how to operate a cell phone (56 RR 125). He never learned to wash\n\ndishes (56 RR 127).\n\n\n      Sabrina Mouton, Petetan’s older sister, testified that up to age two, Petetan\n\nwould cry constantly, wet himself, and not pay attention (56 RR 182). He didn’t\n\nwalk until three years old or talk until four or five years old (56 RR 184).\n\n\n      Growing up, Petetan would not play outside with his sister (56 RR 185). He\n\nwandered around the neighborhood aimlessly by himself (56 RR 185). He never\n                                        - 43 -\n\fwatched television or played games (56 RR 186). He was overweight as a child\n\nand teased by others (56 RR 187). He never learned to ride a bicycle (56 RR 188).\n\n\n      When Petetan came home from prison, she tried to teach him how to use a\n\ncell phone and he could not learn (56 RR 193). He never learned to count money\n\n(56 RR 198). His handwriting is poor (56 RR 201). At the apartment he obtained\n\nwhile on parole, Petetan did not know how to cook for himself or clean up after\n\nhimself (56 RR 197).\n\n\n      Cathy Gauthier, Petetan’s aunt from Lake Charles, testified that Petetan\n\nlived with her for a year when he was 13 or 14 years old (56 RR 241, 244). He\n\nwas real quiet and slower than her children (56 RR 245-246). Petetan did not\n\nattend school for the year he spent with Gauthier (56 RR 251).\n\n\n      Petetan’s cousin, Caston Gauthier, visited Petetan while he was in prison (56\n\nRR 26). When Petetan told Gauthier that he wanted to be a bondsman or rapper\n\nwhen released from prison, Gauthier thought Petetan did not have the intellectual\n\nability to engage in such professions (56 RR 263-264). He never thought Petetan\n\nwas intellectually disabled (56 RR 265).\n\n\n      Kimberly Jackson is Petetan’s cousin and the daughter of Cathy Gauthier\n\n(56 RR 272). She and Petetan are the same age (56 RR 272). She remembered\n\n\n\n                                      - 44 -\n\fthat when Petetan was living with her family, he was not on her level “mind-wise”\n\nand intellectually slower than her (56 RR 272, 274).\n\n\n        Thomas Kemper is Petetan’s uncle (56 RR 276). Petetan has been\n\nintellectually slow since birth (56 RR 279). He was in special education classes in\n\nschool (56 RR 280). As a child, Petetan refused to bathe or groom himself (56 RR\n\n281).\n\n\n        Dr. Ray Coxe is a psychologist from Beaumont (56 RR 313). In 1992, he\n\nwas performing psychological examinations for the court system in Jefferson\n\nCounty in connection with whether juveniles should be certified as adults for\n\npurposes of prosecution (56 RR 315). He examined Petetan at the request of the\n\njuvenile probation department in connection with a pending attempted murder\n\ncharge and whether Petetan should be certified as an adult (56 RR 316-317).\n\nPetetan was 16 years of age at the time of the examination (56 RR 316).\n\n\n        In view of his age, Coxe administered IQ tests for both children and adults to\n\nPetetan (56 RR 318). He explained the child test goes up to age 17 while the adult\n\ntest goes down to age 16 (56 RR 318). Petetan’s full scale IQ on the child version\n\nwas 64 which places him in the lower three percent (56 RR 322). Petetan’s full\n\nscale IQ on the adult test was 74 which places him in the lower four percent (56\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fRR 323). Due to testing differences between the two tests, it is not unusual for the\n\nadult test to be 10 points higher than the child test (56 RR 323).\n\n\n      Coxe also administered achievement tests to Petetan (56 RR 354). The tests\n\nare scored like an IQ test (56 RR 354). Petetan scored 70 on reading, 61 on\n\nspelling, and 46 on mathematics (56 RR 354). Based on testing and evaluation in\n\n1992, Coxe believed Petetan to be mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n\n\n      Dr. Harold Scott, a psychiatrist, was previously a consultant for the Texas\n\nYouth Commission at the Brownwood State School (57 RR 40. 43). He examined\n\nPetetan at the school in 1991 when Petetan was 15 years old (57 RR 45). Scott\n\ndiagnosed Petetan with a conduct disorder and mild mental disability (57 RR 53).\n\nScott explained that mild mental disability meant an IQ score between 55 and 69\n\n(57 RR 55). The diagnosis was based in part on previous IQ testing of Petetan (57\n\nRR 56).\n\n\n      Edmond Stewart is a former professional boxer (57 RR 92). For the last five\n\nyears, he has been a pastor at a jail ministry in the McLennan County Jail (57 RR\n\n95). Stewart met with Petetan in jail and found it hard to have a conversation with\n\nhim because his mind tends to “wander off” (57 RR 98).\n\n\n      Ellis Craig is a psychologist with 47 years of experience working in the area\n\nof adaptive behavior assessments (58 RR 7). He performed an adaptive behavior\n                                        - 46 -\n\fassessment of Petetan by administering a test, reviewing records, and speaking\n\nwith Petetan’s relatives (58 RR 18, 34, and 38). When speaking with Petetan’s\n\nrelatives, Craig sought to determine adaptive behavior before the time Petetan went\n\nto prison at 17 years of age (58 RR 67). Most of the answers provided to his\n\nquestions were examples of adaptive deficits from the time Petetan was a youth of\n\n14 or 15 years old and had not yet gone to prison (58 RR 68). Craig believed\n\nPetetan was forthcoming with him during the assessment and did not intentionally\n\nattempt to underestimate his abilities (58 RR 39).\n\n\n      The information gathered from Petetan’s relatives was graded for adaptive\n\ndisabilities (58 RR 40). The information from Petetan’s mother placed Petetan so\n\nlow that Craig did not consider it reliable (58 RR 40). Petetan’s brother and sister\n\nranked his social skills at the best, conceptual skills second, and practical skills at\n\nthe lowest (58 RR 41).\n\n\n      The scoring of adaptive assessment is similar to scoring on an IQ test with\n\nthe norm in the 85 to 115 range (58 RR 42). The results of the assessment done by\n\nCraig were based on input from Petetan and his relatives and the scores were as\n\nfollows: brother 53; uncle and sister 47; Petetan 42; and Petetan’s mother 40.\n\n\n      Craig concluded Petetan’s adaptive limitations far outweigh his limited skills\n\n(58 RR 47). Craig had to rely on retrospective assessments because there was no\n\n                                         - 47 -\n\fmeasure from when Petetan was a child other than one report noting his adaptive\n\nlimitations without concurrent testing (58 RR 48). Based on his adaptive behavior\n\ndeficits and the IQ scores he has seen, Craig considers Petetan to be moderately\n\nintellectually disabled which is more severe than mildly intellectually disabled\n\n(58 RR 48).\n\n\n      Dr. Kevin Correia, a psychologist, examined Petetan on August 8, 2012, in\n\nconnection with an application for Social Security disability benefits (58 RR 104,\n\n63 RR DX 5). Correia administered an IQ test resulting in a full scale score of 55\n\n(58 RR 104, 63 RR DX 5). Correia diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled in view of his IQ score and adaptive behavior deficits (58 RR 104, 63 RR\n\nDX 5).\n\n\n      Joan Mayfield is a neuropsychologist (58 RR 105). While Petetan was in\n\nthe McLennan County Jail awaiting trial, she administered 16 different tests to him\n\n(58 RR 124). The tests covered areas such as IQ, intellectual ability, attention,\n\nexecutive functioning, academic achievement, memory, learning, language, visual\n\nspatial, and motor coordination (58 RR 117). She did not perform any adaptive\n\nbehavior assessment testing and relied on the testing by Dr. Craig (58 RR 231).\n\n\n      Mayfield explained that one of the components of intellectual disability is\n\nsub-average intellectual functioning as shown by a full scale IQ score of 70 or\n\n                                        - 48 -\n\fbelow, namely, two standard deviations below the mean (58 RR 129). She also\n\nconsidered and looked for evidence of an onset of the condition before the age of\n\n18 (58 RR 132).\n\n\n      Mayfield was provided access to various records including Petetan’s school\n\nrecords and previous psychological testing (58 RR 133). She noted Petetan was\n\nrequired to repeat both the third and sixth grades in school (58 RR 133). He was\n\nsocially promoted to the fourth grade rather than being required to repeat the third\n\ngrade three times (58 RR 133). He ultimately dropped out of school in the ninth\n\ngrade (58 RR 220).\n\n\n      Her testing of Petetan revealed global delays in intellectual ability,\n\nacademic, executive functioning, problem solving, memory, language, motor\n\nskills, and visual perception (58 RR 185). He suffers from sub-average intellectual\n\nfunctioning with an onset before the age of 18 (58 RR 185-186). Her testing\n\nrevealed a full scale IQ score of 52 (58 RR 190). The IQ testing results were\n\nconsistent with other IQ testing results of Petetan she was provided (58 RR 244).\n\n\n      She explained that at the time Coxe administered the child and adult\n\nversions of an IQ test to Petetan, there was a problem in correlating the results and\n\nthose scoring on the lower end of child’s IQ test typically scored 10 to 15 points\n\nbetter on the adult version (58 RR 228). When the tests were revised, the norms\n\n                                        - 49 -\n\ffor the tests were adjusted and there is now good reliability between the two tests\n\nso that the scores are now similar (58 RR 228). She believed Coxe found the\n\nchild’s score of 64 to be more reliable than the adult score of 74 and that is the\n\nreason he diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 228). The\n\ndefense rested on punishment (58 RR 248).\n\n\n      In rebuttal, the State called Meshia Hicks (59 RR 34). Hicks was a clerk at\n\nthe C & E Motel in Waco on September 23, 2012 (59 RR 37). Petetan saw her at\n\nthe motel and asked for a ride to The Landing apartment complex (59 RR 40).\n\nWith Petetan in her car, they drove around the parking lot of the complex (59 RR\n\n41). Petetan told her he was looking for a drug dealer driving a black car (59 RR\n\n41). No such car was observed and they returned to the motel (59 RR 42).\n\n\n      Dorothy Stamps is a retired public school teacher from Port Arthur (59 RR\n\n45). Petetan was in her first grade class (59 RR 50). She did not believe him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 50). Rather, he was a coward and tended to run\n\naway from trouble (59 RR 53).\n\n\n      Eddie Fowler was the principal of the middle school attended by Petetan (59\n\nRR 59). He recalled that he caught Petetan smoking in the bathroom and that\n\nPetetan shot another student off campus (59 RR 62). Petetan was placed in special\n\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\feducation classes because he was a discipline problem (59 RR 63). Otherwise, he\n\nwas an average student and not intellectually disabled (59 RR 63-64).\n\n\n      Petetan’s school records were admitted into evidence (59 RR 69, 63 RR DX\n\n10). Those records reflect he failed two grades and was socially promoted in\n\nanother grade (59 RR 66). He withdrew from school in the eighth grade (63 RR\n\nDX 10).\n\n\n      Mattie Howe was Petetan’s parole officer in Beaumont from May to\n\nSeptember of 2012 (59 RR 70-71). He was required to participate in anger\n\nmanagement classes as part of his parole (59 RR 74). Howe does not believe\n\nPetetan is intellectually disabled (59 RR 75).\n\n\n      Travis Turner works for the Classification Department of TDCJ (59 RR 80).\n\nWhen Petetan was initially received at TDCJ in 1993, he scored at 69 on an IQ test\n\n(59 RR 85). He took an adaptive behavior screening test, but was never assigned\n\nto a prison unit for intellectually disabled offenders (59 RR 85-86).\n\n\n      Turner described the classification system for inmates and security measures\n\nin place for each group of inmates (59 RR 103). He explained that the Crips and\n\nBloods are not part of Security Threat Groups which are automatically housed in\n\nadministrative segregation (59 RR 104).\n\n\n\n                                        - 51 -\n\f      While Warren Kroll was working as a prison guard at the Ferguson Unit of\n\nTDCJ in 1994, he searched Petetan’s cell (59 RR 80. 111). He found a sharpened\n\npiece of steel and a padlock inside a sock (59 RR 111). Petetan was\n\nadministratively charged with possessing a weapon (59 RR 114).\n\n\n      While Robert Blanks was working as a prison guard at the Estelle Unit of\n\nTDCJ in 1998, he saw Petetan and another inmate stab two other inmates while in\n\nthe dining hall (59 RR 124). Petetan was administratively charged with assaulting\n\nanother inmate with a weapon (59 RR 126).\n\n\n      Azikiw Daniels previously served a prison sentence at the Estelle Unit of\n\nTDCJ (59 RR 131). When he heard that Petetan wanted to fight him, Daniels\n\nstruck Petetan on the head with a pipe two or three times (59 RR 138). Two days\n\nlater, Petetan stabbed Daniels while he was working in the serving line of the\n\nkitchen (59 RR 143). Daniels knew that Petetan was a member of the Crips street\n\ngang (59 RR 144).\n\n\n      Jay Hart is in charge of the TDCJ Security Threat Groups Office (59 RR\n\n152). He explained TDCJ recognizes eight different security threat groups\n\nincluding the Crips (59 RR 154). Unlike some other threat groups, Crips are not\n\nautomatically housed in administrative segregation and may have jobs in the\n\ngeneral inmate population (59 RR 159).\n\n                                       - 52 -\n\f      Hart observed various tattoos on Petetan and said they were indicative of\n\nmembership in the Crips (59 RR 161, 165). Petetan identified himself as a Crips\n\nmember to prison authorities in 1999 (59 RR 172). Hart had no record of Petetan\n\never attempting to disassociate from the Crips or renounce his membership in the\n\norganization (59 RR 182).\n\n\n      Mubarak Ali was in the McLennan County Jail on a drug charge while\n\nPetetan was awaiting his capital murder trial in March of 2014 (59 RR 199).\n\nPetetan told Ali that if he acted like he was mentally sick, he would not receive the\n\ndeath penalty (59 RR 203). When Ali asked Petetan to make a telephone call for\n\nhim, Petetan declined by explaining his calls were recorded and he was telling the\n\ncourt he was mentally sick (59 RR 205). Ali admitted he told the State of his\n\nconversations with Petetan at the urging of his lawyer (59 RR 208). Ali’s drug\n\ncharge remained pending at the time of Petetan’s trial (59 RR 200). The State\n\nrested on rebuttal and both sides closed (59 RR 209).\n\n\n      The trial court sustained one of Petetan’s objections to the charge and the\n\nremaining objections were overruled (59 RR 212, 4 CR 1313). The charge was\n\nread to the jury (60 RR 5). Argument was presented (60 RR 15, 24, and 50). The\n\njury returned answers to the four special issues submitted (60 RR 67-68, 4 CR\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\f1336-1339). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, punishment was\n\nassessed by the trial court at death (60 RR 71).\n\n\n                            Summary of the Argument\n\n\n      Twenty-nine points of error are presented on direct appeal. The first two\n\ncomplain of the exclusion of evidence offered by Petetan during the competency\n\ntrial. The trial court refused to allow former counsel to testify relative to Petetan’s\n\ncompetency to stand trial upon erroneously allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege to the admissibility of the evidence. In the second\n\ninstance, after the State suggested Petetan was malingering in an effort to secure a\n\nfinding of incompetency, the trial court refused to admit testimony as to the fate of\n\nthose who secure an incompetency determination through malingering.\n\n\n      Three points of error are presented urging the trial court erred by denying\n\ndefense challenges for cause to prospective jurors during voir dire examination\n\nrelative to the trial on the merits. One venireman had a bias in favor of the death\n\npenalty and a bias in favor of the credibility of law enforcement officers. The\n\nsecond venireman had a bias in favor of the death penalty. Petetan used\n\nperemptory strikes on both, was denied additional strikes, and identified an\n\nobjectionable juror he would have stricken if afforded additional strikes.\n\n\n\n                                         - 54 -\n\f      Petetan challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the underlying\n\nfelonies which elevate the murder to the offense of capital murder. Even viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, no rational juror could have found the\n\nmurder occurred in the course of committing or attempting to commit burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\n      Two points of error assert the trial court erred by admitting extraneous\n\noffenses during the guilt or innocence phase of trial. Those extraneous offenses\n\nwere not relevant to the charged capital murder. The offenses improperly\n\nportrayed Petetan before the jury as a violent drug dealer.\n\n\n      A point complains the trial court undermined Petetan’s right to conflict free\n\ncounsel by admitting evidence from a former client of defense counsel during the\n\npunishment phase of trial. Trial counsel was placed in an impossible position of\n\neffectively representing Petetan while not revealing attorney-client confidences in\n\ncross-examination of his former client.\n\n\n      Petetan complains the jury’s rejection of his claim of intellectual disability is\n\nmanifestly unjust and against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\nConsequently he is not eligible for the death penalty. Overwhelming evidence of\n\nintellectual disability was presented to the jury. Petetan seeks for this Court to\n\nreconsider its flawed Briseno approach and adopt a clinical standards approach to\n\n                                          - 55 -\n\fthe issue as embraced by the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall. However, under\n\neither standard, he has shown himself not to be eligible for a sentence of death.\n\n\n      In fourteen points of error, Petetan maintains the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying his objections to the punishment phase jury charge. Petetan\n\nacknowledges the challenges have been previously rejected by this Court. They\n\nare presented for preservation of the errors and to avoid waiver.\n\n\n      A point of error complains the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment\n\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The point is based on Justice\n\nBreyer’s recent dissenting opinion in Glossip v. Gross.\n\n\n      Petetan argues he was denied equal protection of the law and due course of\n\nlaw due to the absence of a unified statutory procedure for pretrial litigation of an\n\nAtkins assertion of intellectual disability. The point is based on this Court’s recent\n\nopinion in In re Allen recognizing disparity through the state in obtaining such a\n\npretrial determination from a trial court.\n\n\n      The final two points of error seek modification of erroneous recitations\n\nwithin the judgment. Those errors concern the degree of the offense and\n\nassessment of punishment by the jury. The Court has the necessary information\n\nand authority to reform the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                         - 56 -\n\f         Petetan prays this Court will reverse the judgment of conviction and reform\n\nto an acquittal, remand for a new trial, remand for a new punishment hearing,\n\nreform the sentence to a life sentence, remand for a new competency hearing,\n\nmodify the judgment, or enter any other relief appropriate under the law and the\n\nfacts.\n\n\n                                  Point of Error One\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege as to testimony he sought to offer from his former\n\nattorney on the issue of competency to stand trial (13 RR 57).\n\n\n         During the competency trial, Petetan called his former attorney, Stan\n\nSchwieger (13 RR 43). Schwieger was initially appointed to represent Petetan\n\nwhen he was charged with the offense of murdering Kimberly (13 RR 45). He met\n\nwith Petetan shortly after his appointment (13 RR 45). He met with Petetan a\n\nsecond time when the charge was upgraded to capital murder (13 RR 45). At that\n\nsecond meeting, he explained to Petetan that new counsel would be appointed\n\nbecause Schwieger was not on the list of counsel eligible for appointment on\n\ncapital murder cases (13 RR 47).\n\n\n         The State objected to any effort to present privileged information from\n\nSchwieger and the objection was sustained (13 RR 47). Petetan clarified that he\n                                         - 57 -\n\fwas simply attempting to determine whether Schwieger was able to communicate\n\nwith Petetan (13 RR 47). The State’s objection was once again sustained (13 RR\n\n48). Outside the jury, Petetan explained he was not seeking to offer confidential\n\ncommunications, he was simply attempting to show that Schwieger had difficulty\n\ncommunicating with Petetan (13 RR 50). The State again asserted such testimony,\n\neven going to a difficulty in communication, would violate the attorney-client\n\nprivilege (13 RR 50).\n\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, Schwieger testified that Petetan could not\n\nunderstand the reason he was required to withdraw from representation (13 RR\n\n52). When the State again objected, Petetan asserted the State had no standing to\n\nassert an objection based on the privilege and the testimony sought to be offered\n\nwas not privileged (13 RR 53). The State responded that even if it had no right to\n\nassert the privilege, it “had a duty to protect it” (13 RR 53). Petetan claimed the\n\nevidence concerning difficulty in communicating with counsel went to the “heart\n\nof the reason” they were having a competency trial (13 RR 56). The trial court\n\nsustained the State’s objection and excluded the evidence Petetan sought to offer\n\n(13 RR 57). When the jury returned, the trial court instructed it to disregard the\n\nentirety of Schwieger’s testimony (13 RR 61).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 58 -\n\f      A trial court's exclusion of evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n\nOsbourn v. State, 92 S.W.3d 531, 537 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). In determining\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion, an appellate court should consider\n\nwhether the court acted without reference to guiding rules and principles—that is,\n\nwhether the court acted arbitrarily or unreasonably. Montgomery v. State, 810\n\nS.W.2d 372, 380 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). A trial court’s ruling must be upheld so\n\nlong as it is “within the zone of reasonable disagreement.” Wheeler v. State, 67\n\nS.W.3d 879, 888 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\n\n      The State has no authority to seek the exclusion of evidence on the basis its\n\nadmission would violate a defendant’s attorney-client privilege. See TEX. R.\n\nEVID. 503(c) (specifying who may claim the privilege).3 Exclusion of evidence\n\nupon the State wrongly claiming it violates the attorney client privilege is error.\n\nSmith v. State, 770 S.W.2d 70, 71 (Tex. App. – Texarkana 1989, no pet.).\n\n\n      Besides the lack of standing to voice an objection, the State’s objection was\n\nmisguided. The attorney client-privilege is not violated when former counsel\n\n\n3\n (c) Who May Claim. The privilege may be claimed by:\n (1) the client;\n (2) the client's guardian or conservator;\n (3) a deceased client's personal representative; or\n (4) the successor, trustee, or similar representative of a corporation, association,\nor other organization or entity--whether or not in existence.\n\n                                        - 59 -\n\ftestifies relative to competency without revealing the substance of client\n\ncommunication. Manning v. State, 766 S.W.2d 551, 557 (Tex. App. – Dallas\n\n1989, aff’d, 773 S.W.2d 568 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989). Nor is such testimony\n\nexcludable under TEX. R. EVID. 503(b)(2) on the basis it is a fact which came to\n\nthe knowledge of counsel by reason of the attorney-client relationship.4 Manning,\n\n766 S.W.2d 558.\n\n\n      Here, the trial court erroneously allowed the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege upon excluding the evidence sought to be presented by\n\nformer counsel. Moreover, Petetan did not seek to offer confidential\n\ncommunication, only observations by former counsel concerning Petetan’s\n\ndifficulty in communicating with counsel. The evidence was admissible and the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by excluding it.\n\n\n      Harm in the exclusion of evidence is reviewed as non-constitutional error.\n\nRay v. State, 178 S.W.3d 833, 836 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). For non-constitutional\n\nerrors, an appellate court may disregard errors that do not affect the defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b); Robinson v. State, 236 S.W.3d 260,\n\n269 (Tex. App. -Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. ref d). An error affects a substantial\n\n4\n  (2) Special Rule in a Criminal Case. In a criminal case, a client has a privilege\nto prevent a lawyer or lawyer's representative from disclosing any other fact that\ncame to the knowledge of the lawyer or the lawyer's representative by reason of the\nattorney-client relationship.\n                                       - 60 -\n\fright only when the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the\n\njury's verdict. Robinson, 236 S.W.3d at 269 (citing King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266,\n\n271 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997)). In contrast, if the appellate court is fairly assured\n\nthat the error did not influence the jury or had but a slight effect, it will conclude\n\nthe error was harmless. Ray, 178 S.W.3d at 836.\n\n\n      In the instant cause, Petetan had the substantial right to present all available\n\nadmissible evidence in support of his claim of incompetency to stand trial. Recent\n\nformer counsel occupied a unique position with regard to Petetan’s competency to\n\nstand trial in the instant case. Counsel was prevented from testifying to Petetan’s\n\ndifficulty in communicating with his lawyer. As stated by trial counsel, such\n\ntestimony goes to the heart of the competency inquiry. See TEX. CRIM. PROC.\n\nCODE art. 46B.003(a)(1) (sufficient present ability to consult with the person’s\n\nlawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding). Former counsel’s\n\nfirsthand knowledge of Petetan’s difficulty in communicating with counsel is\n\nqualitatively different than the opinions expressed by the experts at the competency\n\ntrial. It is likewise not comparable to the evidence at the competency trial showing\n\nPetetan is willing to lie to a police officer. The burden of proof in a competency\n\nproceeding is on the defendant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he\n\nis incompetent. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 46B.003(b). After considering the\n\n\n\n                                         - 61 -\n\frelatively low burden of proof Petetan was prevented from successfully showing to\n\nthe jury, this Court should find the exclusion of the evidence harmful.\n\n\n      A retrospective competency determination may be conducted consistent with\n\nthe requirements of due process in most cases. See Barber v. State, 737 S.W.2d\n\n824, 828 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (recognizing a retrospective determination of the\n\ncompetency of an accused “can be made within the limits of due process\n\ndepending upon the quality and quantity of the evidence available”). However,\n\nthere are many difficulties inherent in making a retrospective determination of a\n\ndefendant's competency to stand trial, including: (1) the passage of time; (2) the\n\npresent recollection of expert witnesses who testified at the original hearing; and\n\n(3) the ability of the judge and jury to observe the subject of their inquiry. Id.;\n\nCaballero v. State, 587 S.W.2d 741, 743 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979). Petetan’s\n\nfluctuating mental condition, combined with the mounting passage of time,\n\nsuggests that a retrospective competency inquiry is simply not feasible in this case\n\nand a new trial should be ordered. See Greene v. State, 264 S.W.3d 271, 272-73\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008, pet. ref'd) (finding remedy of new trial is\n\nappropriate remedy when retrospective competency determination is not feasible).\n\n\n      In the alternative, Petetan seeks a remand to the trial court for a\n\ndetermination as to whether a retrospective competency hearing is feasible. See\n\n\n                                         - 62 -\n\fTurner v. State, 422 S.W.3d 676, 697 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013): George E. Dix &\n\nJohn M.

The State asserted a\n\ndefendant facing a sentence of death would have a strong motive to lie or\n\n                                       - 63 -\n\fexaggerate during a competency examination (12 RR 103). The State questioned\n\nwhether Seay had the ability to determine whether Petetan lied to her during the\n\nexamination (12 RR 104). It was noted he had already visited with counsel on\n\nseveral occasions before Seay saw him (12 RR 104). She relied on Petetan to be\n\ntruthful and honest with her (12 RR 105). Seay acknowledged that if Petetan gave\n\nher incorrect or incomplete information, it would impact her opinion of his\n\ncompetency (12 RR 106). If a defendant was motivated to delay or avoid trial,\n\nSeay acknowledged he might give false information to the examiner (12 RR 111).\n\n\n      The State’s malingering defense to Petetan’s assertion of incompetency\n\ncontinued with its examination of Dr. Pittman. The State initially stressed that\n\nPittman was the court’s independent expert and had not been hired by the State (12\n\nRR 174).5 Pittman felt Petetan was not reliable during his assessment and was not\n\n“giving it his best shot” (12 RR 181, 184). He was especially suspicious when\n\nPetetan was unable to name the Dallas Cowboys as the professional football team\n\nfrom Dallas (12 RR 181).\n\n\n      On rebuttal, Petetan called his former attorney, Stan Schwieger, a criminal\n\ndefense attorney from Waco (13 RR 43). Outside the presence of the jury, Petetan\n\nasked Schwieger whether he was familiar with the procedures in place at Vernon\n\n5\n  The record reflects Pittman was appointed after being recommended by the State\n(7 RR 5).\n                                      - 64 -\n\fState Hospital for those found incompetent to stand trial through malingering (13\n\nRR 58). In response to the State’s relevancy objection, Petetan urged the\n\ntestimony was admissible in response to the State’s claim he was malingering in an\n\neffort to be found incompetent (13 RR 59). Schwieger explained that those found\n\nto have been malingering before a determination of incompetency are deemed\n\ncompetent by the hospital staff and returned to the originating county for a\n\ncompetency finding and trial (13 RR 59-60). The trial court sustained the State’s\n\nobjection and refused to allow Schwieger to testify as proffered (13 RR 60).\n\n\n      In argument, the State claimed Petetan devised a plan to avoid both trial and\n\nthe death penalty by claiming he was incompetent (13 RR 77). The State\n\nsuggested Petetan manipulated Seay during her assessment (13 RR 80). The State\n\nclaimed that Petetan lied to Pittman and faked his alleged incompetence (13 RR\n\n82, 84). The prosecutor implored the jurors not to be fooled by Petetan’s game\n\nbecause a finding of incompetency means “he ain’t going to get tried” (13 RR 82,\n\n84). That, of course, is not factually or legally true.\n\n\n      Petetan relies on the same standard of review and harm standard as set forth\n\nin the preceding point of error complaining of the exclusion of admissible and\n\nrelevant evidence. Here, Petetan had the substantial right to present all available\n\nadmissible evidence in support of his claim of incompetence. The State urged its\n\n\n                                         - 65 -\n\fdefense of malingering during cross-examination of Seay, direct examination of\n\nPittman, and during argument. In response to that defense, Petetan sought to\n\ndemonstrate that a finding of incompetency based on malingering would be\n\nshort-lived at best and would not mean “he ain’t going to get tried.”\n\n\n       The burden of proof in a competency proceeding is on the defendant to show\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that he is incompetent. TEX. CRIM. PROC.\n\nCODE art. 46B.003(b). After considering the relatively low burden of proof\n\nPetetan was prevented from successfully showing to the jury, this Court should\n\nfind the exclusion of the evidence harmful. Petetan’s fluctuating mental condition,\n\ncombined with the mounting passage of time, suggests that a retrospective\n\ncompetency inquiry is simply not feasible in this case and a new trial should be\n\nordered.\n\n\n                               Point of Error Three\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (28 RR\n\n89).\n\n\n       Richard Hester was called as a prospective juror (28 RR 21). In his\n\nquestionnaire, Hester indicated he was opposed to a life sentence without parole\n                                       - 66 -\n\fbecause he saw no reason to keep someone in prison for their entire life (28 RR\n\n62). He did not believe a life sentence without parole would be sufficient\n\npunishment for one convicted of capital murder (28 RR 63). When asked by the\n\ntrial court if he could ever assess a punishment of life without parole, Hester\n\nresponded that he believed he could, but it would go against his “grain” (28 RR\n\n64).\n\n\n       Defense counsel sought to explore Hester’s “grain” (28 RR 69). Under\n\nquestioning by defense counsel, Hester agreed with the sentiment that one\n\nconvicted of capital murder should be executed rather than have the taxpayers pay\n\nfor incarceration for the rest of his life (28 RR 69). Hester said that despite his bias\n\nagainst a life sentence, he would try to answer the special issues truthfully based on\n\nwhat he believed the answer to be (28 RR 71). Hester made it clear he is in favor\n\nof the death penalty and did not believe enough sentences of death are assessed by\n\njuries (28 RR 81). Hester reiterated that he was opposed to a life sentence without\n\nparole and acknowledged he indicated on his questionnaire that life without parole\n\nis not an adequate punishment for capital murder and he saw no reason to keep a\n\nperson in prison for his entire life following a conviction for capital murder (28 RR\n\n83).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 67 -\n\f      Petetan sought to challenge Hester based on his bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout parole (28 RR 88). The challenge was denied and Petetan used his seventh\n\nperemptory strike to remove Hester (28 RR 89).\n\n\n      Petetan ultimately exhausted his peremptory strikes (47 RR 145). His\n\nrequest for an additional peremptory strike was denied (48 RR 109). Upon\n\ndenying the request for an additional strike, Petetan identified prospective juror\n\nRonald Brown as objectionable because of his work with law enforcement and\n\nprevious employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109). Had Petetan been afforded\n\nan additional strike, he would have used it on Brown (48 RR 109). Brown was\n\nselected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      A defendant may properly challenge any prospective juror who has a bias or\n\nprejudice against any of the law applicable to the case upon which the defense is\n\nentitled to rely, either as a defense to some phase of the offense for which the\n\ndefendant is being prosecuted or as a mitigation thereof or of the punishment\n\ntherefor. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 35.16(c)(2). When reviewing a trial court's\n\ndecision to grant or deny a challenge for cause, the entire record is to be considered\n\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.\n\nFeldman v. State, 71 S.W.3d 728, at 743–45 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002); Patrick v.\n\nState, 906 S.W.2d 481, 488 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995). The test is whether the bias\n\n\n                                         - 68 -\n\for prejudice would substantially impair the prospective juror's ability to carry out\n\nhis oath and instructions in accordance with the law. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–\n\n45. Before a prospective juror may be excused for cause on this basis, however,\n\nthe law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he can follow that\n\nlaw regardless of his personal views. Id. Finally, the proponent of a challenge for\n\ncause has the burden of establishing that his challenge is proper. Id. at 747. The\n\nproponent does not meet his burden until he has shown that the veniremember\n\nunderstood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his or her\n\nprejudice well enough to follow it. Id. When the record reflects that a venireperson\n\nvacillated or equivocated on his or her ability to follow the law, the reviewing\n\ncourt must defer to the trial court. Moore v. State, 999 S.W.2d 385, 400 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App.1999); Brown v. State, 913 S.W.2d 577, 580, (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\n\n      Petetan maintains Hester was subject to a defense challenge for cause due to\n\nhis opposition against a life sentence and preference for a sentence of death.\n\nHester made it clear through the voir dire examination that: he was opposed to a\n\nlife sentence without parole because he saw no reason to keep someone in prison\n\nfor their entire life; he did not believe a life sentence without parole would be\n\nsufficient punishment; he agreed with the sentiment that one convicted of capital\n\nmurder should be executed rather than have the taxpayers pay for incarceration for\n\nthe rest of his life; he is in favor of the death penalty; he did not believe enough\n                                         - 69 -\n\fsentences of death are assessed; he reiterated that he was opposed to a life sentence\n\nwithout parole; and finally, he acknowledged that he indicated on his questionnaire\n\nthat life without parole is not an adequate punishment for capital murder and he\n\nsaw no reason to keep a person in prison for his entire life. The record does not\n\nsupport the trial court’s determination Hester was not subject to a challenge for\n\ncause by the defense. The trial court abused its discretion by denying Petetan’s\n\nchallenge.\n\n\n      To preserve error on denied challenges for cause, the appellant must\n\ndemonstrate on the record that: 1) he asserted a clear and specific challenge for\n\ncause; 2) he used a peremptory challenge on the complained-of venireperson; 3) all\n\nhis peremptory challenges were exhausted; 4) his request for additional strikes was\n\ndenied; and 5) an objectionable juror sat on the jury. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–\n\n45; Green v. State, 934 S.W.2d 92, 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). When the trial\n\ncourt errs in overruling a challenge for cause against a venireperson, the defendant\n\nis harmed if he uses a peremptory strike to remove the venireperson and thereafter\n\nsuffers a detriment from the loss of the strike. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–45;\n\nDemouchette v. State, 731 S.W.2d 75, 83 (Tex.Crim.App.1986).\n\n\n      Here, Petetan properly preserved the issue. He ultimately exhausted his\n\nperemptory strikes (47 RR 145). His request for additional peremptory strike was\n\n\n                                        - 70 -\n\fdenied (48 RR 109). Upon denying the request for an additional strike, Petetan\n\nidentified prospective juror Ronald Brown as objectionable because of his work\n\nwith law enforcement and previous employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109).\n\nHad Petetan been afforded an additional strike, he would have used it on Brown to\n\nprevent him from serving on the jury (48 RR 109). Brown was selected as the\n\ntwelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      Petetan was harmed by the erroneous denial of his challenge for cause\n\nthrough the detrimental loss of a strike. The loss of that strike resulted in a juror\n\nPetetan found objectionable being seated on the jury.\n\n\n      The error only impacts the punishment phase of trial and consequently\n\nPetetan seeks a new punishment hearing. See TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art.\n\n44.29(c) (providing for new punishment hearing in the case of a capital murder\n\nconviction when error affects punishment only); Ransom v. State, 920 S.W.2d 288,\n\n298 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994) (holding that voir dire error in a capital murder case\n\non an issue the jury would only consider at punishment constitutes error affecting\n\npunishment and thus calling for a new punishment hearing).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 71 -\n\f                                Point of Error Four\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who believed law enforcement officers to\n\nbe more credible than other witnesses (28 RR 89).\n\n\n      Richard Hester was called as a prospective juror (28 RR 21). Hester’s\n\nbrother is a police officer (28 RR 85). He felt police officers were more believable\n\nas witnesses as compared to others who are not law enforcement officers (28 RR\n\n86). He felt that way with regard to any testimony as to training or expertise by a\n\npolice officer (28 RR 86). As to general questions and personalities, he would not\n\ngive preferential treatment to the testimony of a police office (28 RR 86).\n\n\n      Petetan sought to challenge Hester based on his bias in favor of the\n\nbelievability of police officers (28 RR 88). The challenge was denied and Petetan\n\nused his seventh peremptory strike to remove Hester (28 RR 89).\n\n\n      Petetan ultimately exhausted his peremptory strikes (47 RR 145). His\n\nrequest for additional peremptory strike was denied (48 RR 109). Upon denying\n\nthe request for an additional strike, Petetan identified prospective juror Ronald\n\nBrown as objectionable because of his work with law enforcement and previous\n\nemployment as a prison guard (48 RR 109). Had Petetan been afforded an\n\n\n\n                                        - 72 -\n\fadditional strike, he would have used it on Brown (48 RR 109). Brown was\n\nselected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      Petetan maintain Hester was subject to a challenge for cause. See TEX.\n\nCRIM. PROC. CODE art. 35.16(a)(9) (providing for challenge for cause for any\n\njuror who has a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant). In this case,\n\nthere is no doubt that venireman Hester’s attitude toward police officers constituted\n\na bias against Petetan. His voir dire examination revealed he believed a police\n\nofficer would be more believable than other witnesses as to matters of training and\n\nexpertise. When considering the fact that eight of the nineteen State's witnesses\n\nwere police officers, these responses become especially important. Those eight\n\npolice officers testified to matters unique to their expertise and training as law\n\nenforcement officers; the very matters to which Hester indicated he would view\n\nwith greater credibility and believability.\n\n\n      A defendant is entitled to a juror who will impartially judge the credibility of\n\nthe witnesses. Shaver v. State, 280 S.W.2d 740, 742 (Tex. Crim. App. 1955).\n\nVenireman Hester’s testimony revealed that his predisposition to believe police\n\nofficers would have prevented him from impartially judging the credibility of those\n\nwitnesses. Such responses effectively demonstrated bias against Petetan. Under\n\nthe circumstances, Petetan’s challenge for cause was improperly denied. See\n\n\n                                         - 73 -\n\fHernandez v. State, 563 S.W.2d 947, 950 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978) (finding defense\n\nchallenge improperly denied as to prospective juror based on her attitude toward\n\nthe credibility of police officers constituted a bias against the defendant).\n\n\n      Petetan properly preserved the issue. He ultimately exhausted his\n\nperemptory strikes (47 RR 145). His request for an additional peremptory strike\n\nwas denied (48 RR 109). Upon denying the request for an additional strike,\n\nPetetan identified prospective juror Ronald Brown as objectionable because of his\n\nwork with law enforcement and previous employment as a prison guard (48 RR\n\n109). Had Petetan been afforded an additional strike, he would have used it on\n\nBrown (48 RR 109). Brown was selected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      Petetan was harmed by the erroneous denial of his challenge for cause\n\nthrough the detrimental loss of a strike. The loss of that strike resulted in a juror\n\nPetetan found objectionable being seated on the jury.\n\n\n      The error impacts both phases of trial and Petetan should be awarded a new\n\ntrial. See TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 44.29(a) (providing for new trial when an\n\nerror affects either the guilt or innocence phase or both phases of trial). Petetan\n\nshould be awarded a new trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 74 -\n\f                                 Point of Error Five\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Luther Fore who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (30 RR\n\n174).\n\n\n        Luther Fore was called as a prospective juror (30 RR 90). In response to\n\nquestions from the prosecutor in voir dire, Fore stated he is “not a big fan” of life\n\nwithout parole for one convicted of capital murder (30 RR 131, 164). If the death\n\npenalty is available, he does not, as a taxpayer, want to pay for someone to live in\n\nprison for the rest of his life (30 RR 131, 164). He agreed that while not a fan of\n\nlife without parole, he would hold the State to its burden of proof with regard to the\n\npunishment phase special issues (30 RR 132). On his juror questionnaire, Fore\n\nindicated a sentence of life without parole would never be a sufficient punishment\n\nfor the offense of capital murder because “they should pay the same price” (30 RR\n\n133). Fore would expect the defense to prove the answer to the first special issue\n\nregarding future dangerousness should be “no” (30 RR 167). If he was serving as\n\na juror and reached the final special issue on mitigation, he feels a sentence of\n\ndeath would be appropriate in view of his answers to the previous special issues\n\n(30 RR 168).\n\n\n                                        - 75 -\n\f      The defense voiced a challenge for cause to Fore based on his bias against a\n\nlife sentence without the possibility of parole and bias in favor of a sentence of\n\ndeath (30 RR 174). The challenge for cause was denied by the trial court (30 RR\n\n174). Petetan used his eighth peremptory strike on Fore (30 RR 174).\n\n\n      Petetan ultimately exhausted his peremptory strikes (47 RR 145). His\n\nrequest for an additional peremptory strike was denied (48 RR 109). Upon\n\ndenying the request for an additional strike, Petetan identified prospective juror\n\nRonald Brown as objectionable because of his work with law enforcement and\n\nprevious employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109). Had Petetan been afforded\n\nan additional strike, he would have used it on Brown (48 RR 109). Brown was\n\nselected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      A defendant may properly challenge any prospective juror who has a bias or\n\nprejudice against any of the law applicable to the case upon which the defense is\n\nentitled to rely, either as a defense to some phase of the offense for which the\n\ndefendant is being prosecuted or as a mitigation thereof or of the punishment\n\ntherefor. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 35.16(c)(2). When reviewing a trial court's\n\ndecision to grant or deny a challenge for cause, the entire record is to be considered\n\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.\n\nFeldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–45; Patrick, 906 S.W.2d at 488. The test is whether\n\n\n                                         - 76 -\n\fthe bias or prejudice would substantially impair the prospective juror's ability to\n\ncarry out his oath and instructions in accordance with the law. Feldman, 71\n\nS.W.3d at 743–45. Before a prospective juror may be excused for cause on this\n\nbasis, however, the law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he\n\ncan follow that law regardless of his personal views. Id. Finally, the proponent of\n\na challenge for cause has the burden of establishing that his challenge is proper. Id.\n\nat 747. The proponent does not meet his burden until he has shown that the\n\nveniremember understood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his\n\nor her prejudice well enough to follow it. Id. When the record reflects that a\n\nvenireperson vacillated or equivocated on his or her ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial court. Moore, 999 S.W.2d at 400; Brown,\n\n913 S.W.2d at 580.\n\n\n      Petetan maintains Fore was subject to a defense challenge for cause due to\n\nhis opposition against a life sentence and preference for a sentence of death. Fore\n\nmade it clear through the voir dire examination that: he is “not a big fan” of life\n\nwithout parole for one convicted of capital murder; if the death penalty is\n\navailable, he does not, as a taxpayer, want to pay for someone to live in prison for\n\nthe rest of his life; in his juror questionnaire, Fore indicated a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole would never be a sufficient punishment for the offense of capital\n\nmurder because “they should pay the same price;” Fore would expect the defense\n                                          - 77 -\n\fto prove the answer to the first special issue regarding future dangerousness should\n\nbe “no;” and if he was serving as a juror and reached the final special issue on\n\nmitigation, he feels a sentence of death would be appropriate in view of his\n\nanswers to the previous special issues. The record does not support the trial court’s\n\ndetermination Fore was not subject to a challenge for cause by the defense. The\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by denying Petetan’s challenge to prospective juror\n\nFore.\n\n\n        To preserve error on denied challenges for cause, the appellant must\n\ndemonstrate on the record that: 1) he asserted a clear and specific challenge for\n\ncause; 2) he used a peremptory challenge on the complained-of venireperson; 3) all\n\nhis peremptory challenges were exhausted; 4) his request for additional strikes was\n\ndenied; and 5) an objectionable juror sat on the jury. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–\n\n45; Green, 934 S.W.2d at 105. When the trial court errs in overruling a challenge\n\nfor cause against a venireperson, the defendant is harmed if he uses a peremptory\n\nstrike to remove the venireperson and thereafter suffers a detriment from the loss\n\nof the strike. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–45; Demouchette, 731 S.W.2d at 83.\n\n\n        Here, Petetan properly preserved the issue. He ultimately exhausted his\n\nperemptory strikes (47 RR 145). His request for additional peremptory strike was\n\ndenied (48 RR 109). Upon denying the request for an additional strike, Petetan\n\n\n                                        - 78 -\n\fidentified prospective juror Ronald Brown as objectionable because of his work\n\nwith law enforcement and previous employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109).\n\nHad Petetan been afforded an additional strike, he would have used it on Brown\n\n(48 RR 109). Brown was selected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      Petetan was harmed by the erroneous denial of his challenge for cause\n\nthrough the detrimental loss of a strike. The loss of that strike resulted in a juror\n\nPetetan found objectionable being seated on the jury.\n\n\n      The error only impacts the punishment phase of trial and consequently\n\nPetetan seeks a new punishment hearing. See TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art.\n\n44.29(c) (providing for new punishment hearing in the case of a capital murder\n\nconviction when error affects punishment only); Ransom, 920 S.W.2d at 298\n\n(holding that voir dire error in a capital murder case on an issue the jury would\n\nonly consider at punishment constitutes error affecting punishment and thus calling\n\nfor a new punishment hearing).\n\n\n                                 Point of Error Six\n\n\nThe evidence is insufficient to prove Petetan murdered the complainant while\n\nin the course of committing or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\n\n                                         - 79 -\n\f      The grand jury returned an indictment charging Petetan with the offense of\n\ncapital murder (1 CR 44). Specifically, it was alleged he murdered Kimberly\n\nPetetan while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of\n\nburglary of Kimberly Petetan’s habitation, the kidnapping of Kimberly Petetan or\n\nA. W., and retaliation against Kimberly Petetan (1 CR 44). See TEX. PEN. CODE\n\n§ 19.03(a)(2). At the conclusion of the guilt or innocence phase of trial, the court\n\ncharged the jury (4 CR 1300). The jury was instructed it could convict if it found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Petetan murdered Kimberly while in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary, kidnapping, or\n\nretaliation (4 CR 1300). The jury was instructed it did not have to unanimously\n\nagree on a particular underlying felony, just that the murder occurred during one or\n\nmore of the underlying and alleged felonies (4 CR 1300). The jury found Petetan\n\nguilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment (4 CR 1308).\n\n\n       This point of error challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove\n\nPetetan murdered while in the course of committing or attempting to commit one\n\nof the underlying felonies alleged in the indictment. The state of the evidence is\n\nsuch that no rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Petetan\n\ncommitted one of the underlying felonies. Petetan seeks to have the judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 80 -\n\freformed to a conviction for the offense of murder and the cause remanded for a\n\nnew punishment hearing.6\n\n\n       In a due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, the reviewing court is to view all of the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v.\n\nVirginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); Dobbs v. State, 434 S.W.3d 166, 170 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2014). This standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of\n\nfact to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw\n\nreasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319;\n\nDobbs, 434 S.W.3d at 170.\n\n\n       The trier of fact is the sole judge of the weight and credibility of the\n\nevidence. See TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 38.04; Dobbs, 434 S.W.3d at 170.\n\nThus, when performing an evidentiary sufficiency review, a reviewing court may\n\nnot re-evaluate the weight and credibility of the evidence and substitute its\n\njudgment for that of the factfinder. Isassi v. State, 330 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2010). Instead, the reviewing court must determine whether the\n\nnecessary inferences are reasonable based upon the cumulative force of the\n\n\n6\n    The jury was charged on the lesser included offense of murder (4 CR 1300).\n                                        - 81 -\n\fevidence when viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict. Sorrells v. State,\n\n343 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex .Crim. App. 2011); Temple v. State, 390 S.W.3d 341,\n\n360 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). It is presumed that the factfinder resolved any\n\nconflicting inferences in favor of the verdict and the reviewing court must defer to\n\nthat resolution. Jackson, 443 U.S. at 326; Dobbs, 434 S.W.3d at 170.\n\n\n      This Court has held “in the course of committing” an offense listed in §\n\n19.03(a)(2), means conduct occurring in an attempt to commit, during the\n\ncommission, or in the immediate flight after the attempt or commission of the\n\noffense. Wooldridge v. State, 653 S.W.2d 811, 816 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); Riles\n\nv. State, 595 S.W.2d 858, 862 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980). Moreover, the State must\n\nprove a nexus between the murder and the aggravating offense; that is, the State\n\nmust show that, during the commission of the offense or while in immediate flight,\n\nthe defendant killed the victim to facilitate the underlying felony offense. Ibanez v.\n\nState, 749 S.W.2d 804, 807 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986); Whitaker v. State, 977\n\nS.W.2d 869, 873 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1998, pet. ref'd); Hernandez v. State, 969\n\nS.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. ref'd).\n\n\n      At the outset, Petetan maintains the evidence does not show a burglary of\n\nKimberly’s apartment. Evidence at trial showed Petetan told Miller and Mouton to\n\nget in the bed of the truck and they all drove to Kimberly’s apartment complex and\n\n\n                                        - 82 -\n\fthey entered the apartment when Kimberly opened the door (53 RR 54, 56).\n\nMouton testified that he and Miller got in the bed of Kimberly’s truck and she\n\ndrove the five of them to her apartment and they all entered the apartment when\n\nKimberly opened the door to the apartment (53 RR 110, 111, and 131). A. W.\n\nstated that the five of them left the motel, returned to her mother’s apartment, and\n\neveryone went inside (53 RR 183, 184). Kimberly was shot two hours after they\n\narrived at the apartment (53 RR 56).\n\n\n      The evidence fails to support the allegation of a burglary of Kimberly’s\n\napartment. The undisputed evidence shows that before the shooting, Kimberly\n\nopened her apartment for Petetan, Miller, Mouton, and her daughter to enter. In\n\nview of that evidence, the State failed to show Petetan entered the apartment\n\nwithout the effective consent of Kimberly. See TEX. PEN. CODE § 30.02(a)\n\n(providing for the offense of burglary if one enters a habitation without the\n\neffective consent of the owner); Villanueva v. State, 711 S.W.2d 739, 740 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1986) pet. ref’d 725 S.W.2d 244 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987);\n\nEppinger v. State, 800 S.W.2d 652, 653 (Tex. App.—Austin 1990, pet. ref'd)\n\n(finding evidence insufficient in burglary prosecution after owner expressly\n\nassented to defendant entering his apartment).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 83 -\n\f      Petetan concedes the evidence shows that hours before the shooting, he\n\npushed his way into the apartment without Kimberly inviting him in, pulled a gun\n\nfrom his pocket, and waved the gun around the apartment (53 RR 174, 175).\n\nWhile that conduct constituted a burglary, it was so removed in time as to not have\n\na nexus to the later shooting of Kimberly sufficient to support the conviction for\n\ncapital murder. The evidence clearly shows the complainant was not killed during\n\nPetetan’s initial burglarious conduct. She was only killed after having left her\n\napartment and then later consented to Petetan’s entry before her shooting. The\n\nevidence does not show the complainant was killed while Petetan was in the course\n\nof committing or attempting to commit burglary of a habitation.\n\n\n      The evidence also fails to demonstrate Petetan restrained either Kimberly or\n\nA. W. with intent to prevent their liberation in the course of the capital murder.\n\nSee TEX. PEN. CODE §§ 20.01(2) and 20.03(b). Absent such evidence, the\n\nevidence will only support a conviction for the offense of murder.\n\n\n      Miller testified that as Kimberly was trying to walk out the front door,\n\nPetetan slammed the door shut, struck her with his fist, and then shot her multiple\n\ntimes (53 RR 57, 59). Miller stated that no one told A. W. and Mouton to get in\n\nPetetan’s Suburban, they simply did so after the shooting (53 RR 90).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 84 -\n\f      Mouton testified that when Kimberly and Petetan came downstairs in her\n\napartment, she tried to unlock and open the front door, but Petetan pushed her\n\naway and into a wall (53 RR 117). When Kimberly pushed Petetan back, he shot\n\nher multiple times with a handgun (53 RR 118). After the shooting, Mouton and\n\nA. W. ran out the back door of the apartment and jumped into Petetan’s vehicle\n\n(53 RR 121). Mouton intended to drive the two of them away, but Miller and\n\nPetetan came outside and entered the vehicle before he could do so (53 RR 121).\n\nMouton did not force A. W. to get in the vehicle with him; she simply followed\n\nhim out of the apartment after the shooting of her mother (53 RR 135).\n\n\n      A. W. testified that when her mother tried to open the front door, Petetan\n\nran toward the door, shut it, and pushed her mother into a wall (53 RR 190).\n\nPetetan told her mother to stand on the stairs, that it was “time for her dust away,”\n\nand then he shot her three times (53 RR 191). Her mother fell to the ground and\n\n“flopped around like a fish” (53 RR 192).\n\n\n      The younger of two other men in the apartment, Mouton, grabbed her and\n\ntook her out the back door of the apartment (53 RR 192). He told her that\n\neverything would be okay (53 RR 193). All four of them then got in Petetan’s\n\nwhite Suburban and left (53 RR 195).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 85 -\n\f      Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, Petetan\n\nmaintains the evidence is insufficient to prove he committed or attempted to\n\ncommit the offense of kidnapping against either Kimberly or A. W. Neither was\n\nsecreted or held in a place where they were not likely to be found. See TEX. PEN.\n\nCODE § 20.01(2)(A). Neither was restrained by the use of or threat to use deadly\n\nforce. See TEX. PEN. CODE § 20.01(2)(B).\n\n\n      Petetan concedes the evidence shows that hours before the shooting, he\n\npushed his way into the apartment without Kimberly inviting him in, pulled a gun\n\nfrom his pocket, and started waving it around the apartment (53 RR 174, 175).\n\nPetetan told Kimberly to get dressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). The three\n\nof them got into Kimberly’s truck and Kimberly was driving (53 RR 177). Petetan\n\nstill had the gun in his pocket while in the truck (53 RR 178). Petetan directed\n\nKimberly to drive to a motel in Waco (53 RR 179). Once they arrived at the motel,\n\nPetetan told Kimberly to honk the horn of the truck (53 RR 180). Two men came\n\nout of a room and got in the bed of the truck (53 RR 180). All five individuals left\n\nthe motel and returned to her mother’s apartment (53 RR 183). While that conduct\n\nconstituted a kidnapping of both Kimberly and A. W., it was so removed in time as\n\nto not have a nexus to the later shooting of Kimberly sufficient to support the\n\nconviction for capital murder. The evidence clearly shows the complainant was\n\nnot killed during Petetan’s initial kidnapping. She was only killed after having left\n                                        - 86 -\n\fher apartment and then later returning to her own apartment before the shooting.\n\nPetetan was not shown to have restrained Kimberly or A. W. in the apartment\n\nupon returning and before the shooting. Finally, A. W. was shown to have\n\nvoluntarily left with Mouton following the shooting of her mother. The evidence\n\ndoes not show the complainant was killed while Petetan was in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offenses of kidnapping against either\n\nKimberly or A. W.\n\n\n      Finally, the evidence fails to demonstrate Petetan murdered Kimberly while\n\nin the course of attempting or committing the offense of retaliation. See TEX. PEN.\n\nCODE § 36.06. The evidence fails to show he threatened to harm Kimberly in\n\nretaliation for her reporting his assault of her in Port Arthur. § 36.06(a)(1)(B).\n\nLikewise, there is insufficient evidence to show Petetan harmed or threated to harm\n\nKimberly to prevent or delay her service as a witness or a person who had reported\n\na crime. § 36.06(a)(2)(A) &(B). Absent such evidence, the evidence will only\n\nsupport a conviction for the offense of murder rather than capital murder.\n\n\n      On September 13, 2012, Ryan Kidwell, of the Port Arthur Police\n\nDepartment, responded to a domestic disturbance call (52 RR 83). Kimberly\n\nPetetan told Kidwell that Petetan assaulted her when she asked him to stop\n\nsmoking in the apartment because her daughter has asthma (52 RR 85). She said\n\n\n                                        - 87 -\n\fPetetan had thrown her to the floor and held a kitchen knife close to her (52 RR\n\n86). While holding the knife close to her, Petetan said “I could kill you, do you\n\nwant to die in front of your child?” (52 RR 88).\n\n\n       Petetan had left the apartment by the time Kidwell arrived (52 RR 87).\n\nKimberly told the officer she wanted to file assault charges against Petetan and she\n\nknew it would be a felony since he used a knife during the assault (52 RR 90). She\n\nalso told the officer she was leaving Port Arthur and moving back to Waco (52 RR\n\n93).\n\n\n       A. W. testified that when her mother opened the door in Waco 10 days after\n\nher assault in Port Arthur, Petetan pushed his way into the apartment without her\n\nmother inviting him in (53 RR 174). Petetan pulled a gun from his pocket and\n\nstarted waving it around the apartment (53 RR 175). Petetan told her mother to get\n\ndressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). Petetan told her mother they were\n\ngoing to Port Arthur and she was “going to tell the cops what happened” (53 RR\n\n177). Rather than go to Port Arthur, they traveled to a motel in Waco in picked up\n\nMiller and Mouton (53 RR 180). The five of them left the motel and returned to\n\nKimberly’s apartment (53 RR 183).\n\n\n       For purposes of the retaliation statute, the State must prove harm or a threat\n\nto harm in retaliation or to prevent service. Meyer v. State, 366 S.W.3d 728, 731\n\n                                        - 88 -\n\f(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2012, no pet.). “Harm” is defined as “anything reasonably\n\nregarded as loss, disadvantage, or injury....” TEX. PEN. CODE § 1.07(25).\n\n\n      Here, the evidence fails to show Petetan harmed or threatened to harm\n\nKimberly in retaliation for reporting his assault of her. Likewise, there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to show Petetan harmed or threated to harm Kimberly to\n\nprevent or delay her service as a witness or a person who had reported a crime. At\n\nmost, the evidence simply shows Petetan intended to take Kimberly to Port Arthur\n\nand she was “going to tell the cops what happened” (53 RR 177). Such a stated\n\nintention does not constitute harm or a threat of harm. On the contrary, taken at\n\nface value, the stated intent is to safely transport her to Port Arthur to provide\n\ninformation to the authorities on the previously reported assault. Absent evidence\n\nof harm or threaten to harm in relation to the prior assault, the evidence does not\n\nsupport a conviction for capital murder.\n\n\n      Petetan has demonstrated that none of the underlying aggravating elements\n\nfind evidentiary support in the record. This Court should reform the judgment to\n\nthe offense of murder and remand the cause to the trial court for a new punishment\n\nproceeding.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 89 -\n\f                              Point of Error Seven\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Miller he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Miller drugs if he would drive Petetan to\n\nWaco (53 RR 31).\n\n\n                              Point of Error Eight\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Mouton he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and will give Mouton drugs if he would accompany\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 31).\n\n\n      The State proffered evidence it sought to present showing Petetan told Miller\n\nhe was coming to Waco on the day of the murder to buy drugs and would give\n\nMiller drugs in return for driving him to Waco (53 RR 28). The State claimed such\n\nevidence was admissible to show Miller’s motive for coming to Waco on the day\n\nof the murder and to rebut the defense assertion in opening that Miller murdered\n\nKimberly (53 RR 28). The defense objected that such evidence was an\n\ninadmissible extraneous offense (53 RR 29). The trial court overruled Petetan’s\n\nobjection and granted him a running objection to the evidence the State sought to\n\noffer (53 RR 31-32).\n                                       - 90 -\n\f      In the presence of the jury, Miller testified he and Petetan have known each\n\nother since they grew up in Port Arthur (53 RR 34). Early in the morning of\n\nSeptember 23, 2012, Miller saw Petetan at a convenience store in Port Arthur (53\n\nRR 36). Petetan told Miller he was going to Waco to buy some drugs and needed\n\nMiller to drive him to Waco (53 RR 36-37). Petetan offered to give Miller an\n\nounce of crack cocaine and some money if he would drive him to Waco (53 RR\n\n37). Miller did not know Petetan was married or his wife’s name (53 RR 39, 53).\n\nHe met Kimberly and A. W. for the first time when they picked him up at the\n\nmotel in Waco with Petetan (53 RR 52). He did not kill Kimberly, never had any\n\nintention to kill her, and did not know her before they met in Waco on the day of\n\nher death (53 RR 75, 78).\n\n\n      Mouton testified that Petetan asked him to accompany him to Waco on the\n\nday of the murder (53 RR 100). Petetan said he was going to Waco to buy five\n\nounces of drugs and would give Mouton two of the five ounces if he would come\n\nwith him to Waco (53 RR 101). They went to a convenience store, picked up\n\nMiller, and started driving toward Waco (53 RR 102). Mouton did not know\n\nPetetan was married or had a wife in Waco (53 RR 103).\n\n\n      An extraneous offense is any act of misconduct, whether resulting in\n\nprosecution or not, that is not shown in the charging papers and shown to have\n\n\n                                       - 91 -\n\fbeen committed by the accused. Rankin v. State, 953 S.W.2d 740, 741 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996). A trial court should be diligent and forever mindful of the devastating\n\nimpact of extraneous offense evidence on the jury's rational disposition towards\n\nother evidence because of the jury's natural inclination to infer guilt to the charged\n\noffense from the extraneous offenses. Abdnor v. State, 871 S.W.2d 726, 738 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1994). In fact, to ensure that a defendant is tried only for the crime\n\nwith which he is charged and not for criminal propensity, evidence of extraneous\n\noffenses is normally inadmissible. Moses v. State, 105 S.W.3d 622, 626 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2003).\n\n\n      The general rule of law is that evidence of extraneous offenses or prior\n\nwrongful acts is inadmissible as evidence of a person's character—and rightly so—\n\nbecause of the inherent prejudice that such evidence could unsuspectingly have on\n\njurors. Johnston v. State, 145 S.W.3d 215, 219 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n\nGenerally, an accused may only be tried for the offense with which he is charged\n\nand not for being a criminal generally. Lockhart v. State, 847 S.W.2d 568, 570\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992). TEX. R. EVID. 404(b) seeks to protect the defendant from\n\nthe inherent dangers presented by the admission of extraneous offenses.\n\n\n      A trial court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of\n\nevidence, and its decision will not be disturbed absent a showing that discretion\n\n\n                                        - 92 -\n\fwas abused. Mozon v. State, 991 S.W.2d 841 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999).\n\nExtraneous-offense evidence is admissible if that evidence satisfies a two-pronged\n\ntest: (1) whether the extraneous-offense evidence is relevant to a fact of\n\nconsequence in the case aside from its tendency to show action in conformity with\n\ncharacter; and (2) whether the probative value of the evidence is not substantially\n\noutweighed by unfair prejudice. Mann v. State, 718 S.W.2d 741, 743 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1986). To be admissible, extraneous offense evidence must be relevant apart\n\nfrom its proof of character conformity. Alba v. State, 905 S.W.2d 581, 585 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1995).\n\n\n      Petetan maintains the evidence of other crimes, wrongs, and acts of which he\n\nnow complains was erroneously admitted contrary to TEX. R. EVID. 404(b) as\n\ncharacter conformity evidence. The extraneous offenses and bad acts had no\n\nrelevance to the capital murder charge pending against Petetan.\n\n\n      The State claimed such evidence was admissible to show Miller’s motive for\n\ncoming to Waco on the day of the murder and to rebut the defense assertion in\n\nPetetan’s opening statement that Miller murdered Kimberly (53 RR 28). Neither\n\nof the reasons supports admission of the extraneous offenses involving Miller and\n\nMouton. Their motive for coming to Waco on the day of the murder was irrelevant\n\nto the charged offense. A review of the defense opening statement does not\n\n\n                                        - 93 -\n\fsupport the State’s claim that Petetan suggested Miller was responsible for the\n\nmurder (51 RR 40-44).\n\n\n      The trial court agreed the extraneous offences were admissible to show\n\nmotive, intent, and preparation (53 RR 32). Petetan disagrees.\n\n\n      The extraneous conduct was not necessary to prove intent in the instant\n\nprosecution. Petetan’s intent to cause serious bodily injury or death could be\n\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon, a firearm. See Arnold v. State, 234\n\nS.W.3d 664, 672 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, no pet.); Darkins v. State,\n\n430 S.W.3d 559, 565 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. ref'd). The\n\nState was erroneously permitted to portray Petetan as a drug dealer and a criminal\n\nin general.\n\n\n      Likewise, the complained of evidence was inadmissible to prove motive to\n\nkill Kimberly. Though motive is not an element of capital murder, the prosecution\n\nmay offer evidence to show motive for the commission of the offense because it is\n\nrelevant as a circumstance to prove the commission of the offense. See Crane v.\n\nState, 786 S.W.2d 338, 349–50 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). Once the opponent of\n\nextraneous-acts evidence raises an appropriate character-evidence objection, the\n\nproponent of the evidence must satisfy the trial court that the evidence has\n\nrelevance apart from proving character conformity. Johnston, 145 S.W.3d at 220;\n\n                                       - 94 -\n\fLopez v. State, 200 S.W.3d 246, 252 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet.\n\nref'd.); Montgomery v. State, 810 S.W.2d 372, 387 (Tex.Crim.App.1991).\n\nPetetan’s extraneous bad acts involving Miller and Mouton have no logical\n\nrelevance to the shooting of Kimberly. The State was erroneously permitted to\n\nportray Petetan as a dope-dealing criminal in general.\n\n\n      Finally, Petetan argues the extraneous offenses were not admissible on the\n\nissue of preparation. The extraneous offenses did not prove the existence of a\n\nlarger plan of which the capital murder was a part. The evidence was not shown to\n\nhave furthered the capital murder of Kimberly or in contemplation of the offense.\n\nThe evidence was erroneously admitted and portrayed Petetan as a dope-dealing\n\ncriminal in general.\n\n\n      Petetan has demonstrated an abuse of discretion in the admission of the\n\ncomplained of evidence. The evidence was erroneously admitted and painted him\n\nas a criminal in general.\n\n\n      Error under the rules of evidence in the admission of evidence constitutes\n\nnonconstitutional error. Johnson v. State, 967 S.W.2d 410, 417 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998). A reviewing court is to disregard nonconstitutional error that does not\n\naffect the substantial rights of the defendant. TEX. R. APP. P. 44.2(b). A\n\nsubstantial right is affected when the error had a substantial and injurious effect or\n\n                                        - 95 -\n\finfluence in determining the jury's verdict. King v. State, 953 S.W.2d 266, 271\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1997) (citing Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776\n\n(1946)). In Kotteakos, the United States Supreme Court explained:\n\n\n      “[I]f one cannot say, with fair assurance, after pondering all that\n      happened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that\n      the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error, it is\n      impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected. The\n      inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the\n      result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so,\n      whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left\n      in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.” 328 U.S. at 765.\n\n\n      The Supreme Court has defined “grave doubts” to mean “in the judge's\n\nmind, the matter is so evenly balanced that he feels himself in virtual equipoise as\n\nto the harmlessness of the error.” Webb v. State, 36 S.W.3d 164, 182 (Tex. App.-\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. ref’d). If the reviewing court is unsure whether the\n\nerror affected the outcome, the court should treat the error as harmful, that is, as\n\nhaving a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's\n\nverdict. Id.\n\n\n      The defendant is not required to prove harm from an error. Johnson v. State,\n\n43 S.W.3d 1, 4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Indeed, there ordinarily is no way to\n\nprove “actual” harm. Id. It is instead the duty of the reviewing court to assess\n\nharm from the context of the error. Id. Thus, the proper inquiry is whether the\n\ntrial court's error in allowing the State to introduce evidence of other crimes,\n                                           - 96 -\n\fwrongs, and acts by Petetan substantially swayed or influenced the jury's verdict,\n\nor whether this Court is left in grave doubt as to whether this extraneous offense\n\nevidence substantially swayed or influenced the jury's verdict. See Kotteakos, 328\n\nU.S. at 765; Johnson, 43 S.W.3d at 4. In making that determination, this Court\n\nshould consider the trial court's erroneous admission of the extraneous offense\n\nevidence in the context of the entire record and not just whether there was\n\nsufficient or overwhelming evidence of Petetan’s guilt. See Motilla v. State, 78\n\nS.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\n\n      Extraneous offense evidence can have a devastating impact on the jury's\n\nrational disposition towards other evidence because of the jury's natural inclination\n\nto infer guilt to the charged offense from the extraneous offenses. Abdnor, 871\n\nS.W.2d at 738. Here, the erroneous admission of the other crimes, wrongs, and\n\nacts, was of such a magnitude that in all probability it disrupted the jury's orderly\n\nevaluation of the evidence and had a devastating impact on the jury's rational\n\ndisposition towards other evidence. The natural inclination of the jury was to infer\n\nPetetan’s guilt of capital murder because he was portrayed as a criminal in general\n\ndue to his other criminal activity.\n\n\n      After reviewing the entire record, this Court will be unable to find with fair\n\nassurance that the erroneous admission of other crimes, wrongs, and acts did not\n\n\n                                        - 97 -\n\fhave a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's verdict. This Court\n\ncannot say, with fair assurance, after considering the entire record without\n\nstripping it of the erroneous admission of the extraneous matters, that the judgment\n\nwas not substantially swayed by the errors. The errors were harmful under TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 44.2(b). Petetan should be awarded a new trial free of such errors.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Nine\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence which undermined\n\ndefense counsel before the jury and created a conflict of interest which denied\n\nPetetan his right to the effective assistance of counsel (59 RR 198).\n\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, Petetan’s lead counsel, Russ Hunt, told the\n\ncourt he had recently represented Mubarak Ali, a witness the State might call at the\n\npunishment phase of trial (52 RR 188). The trial court told second chair defense\n\ncounsel, Skip Reaves, to conduct the cross-examination of Ali if he was called as a\n\nwitness by the State (52 RR 190).\n\n\n      A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury on Petetan’s objection to\n\nthe State calling Mubarak Ali as a rebuttal witness at the punishment phase of trial\n\n(59 RR 6). Lead counsel for Petetan, Russ Hunt, stated he represented Ali for\n\nthree or four weeks on a synthetic marijuana charge while also representing\n\nPetetan on his pending capital murder charge (59 RR 7). It was urged that\n                                        - 98 -\n\fpermitting Ali’s testimony before the jury would create an actual conflict of\n\ninterest for Hunt by having a former client testify against a current client (59 RR\n\n8).\n\n\n       Specifically, it was urged that information Hunt learned from Ali could not\n\nbe used by Hunt or shared with fellow counsel in order to effectively cross-\n\nexamine Ali (59 RR 9). Hunt represented that he learned facts about Petetan from\n\nAli while he was representing Ali (59 RR 9). Allowing Ali to testify would place\n\nHunt in the position of being called as a rebuttal witness to Ali’s testimony (59 RR\n\n11).\n\n\n       Still outside the presence of the jury, Ali testified Petetan talked to him in\n\njail and told him that Hunt was his lawyer (59 RR 16). Petetan told Ali that he was\n\ncharged with murdering his wife and that Hunt had told him to act like he was\n\nmentally sick so he would not get the death penalty (59 RR 17). Petetan also told\n\nAli that Hunt had told Petetan not to use the jail phone and to act like he was\n\nmentally sick (59 RR 18, 19). Ali hired Hunt on his drug case when he was\n\nreleased from jail on bond (59 RR 19). He initially hired Hunt because Petetan had\n\nsaid he was a good lawyer (59 RR 22). He did not otherwise provide any\n\ninformation to Hunt concerning Petetan (59 RR 21-22).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 99 -\n\f      He met with Hunt once and then hired another lawyer (59 RR 19). He was\n\ndissatisfied with Hunt because Hunt was never in the office and did not return\n\nAli’s calls (59 RR 26). Hunt ultimately returned Ali’s retainer (59 RR 26). After\n\nhiring new counsel and at the urging of his new lawyer, Ali went to the District\n\nAttorney’s Office to reveal Petetan’s statements to him in jail (59 RR 24).\n\n\n      Petetan continued to express a concern that Hunt had a conflict of interest\n\nbecause he was a potential rebuttal witness to Ali’s assertion Petetan said that Hunt\n\ntold him to feign mental illness (59 RR 26). Hunt was further hampered because\n\nhe could not reveal any confidential information learned from Ali while\n\nrepresenting him on the drug charge (59 RR 26). Petetan further complained the\n\ntestimony from Ali would undermine Hunt’s credibility before the jury with\n\nrespect to the intellectual disability defense put forth at punishment (59 RR 27-28).\n\nHunt said that at the time he was representing Ali, Ali did not know that Petetan\n\nwas charged with murdering his wife (59 RR 29).\n\n\n      The State offered to limit Ali’s testimony by not revealing that Petetan said\n\ncounsel told him to act mentally ill to avoid the death penalty (59 RR 31). Petetan\n\ncontinued to object that even with such a limitation, the jury would be left to\n\nspeculate as to who had told Petetan to feign mental illness and that defense\n\ncounsel would be a prime target of that speculation (59 RR 32). Hunt complained\n\n\n                                       - 100 -\n\fthat Ali did not know Petetan had been charged with murder at the time he\n\nallegedly made the statements to Ali in the jail (59 RR 33-34).\n\n\n      Overruling all of Petetan’s previous objections, the trial court permitted Ali\n\nto testify in the presence of the jury (59 RR 198). Ali testified he was in the\n\nMcLennan County Jail with Petetan in March of 2014 (59 RR 199). He knew\n\nPetetan by his nickname “Big Boy” (59 RR 202). Petetan told Ali that if he acted\n\nlike he was mentally sick, he would not receive the death penalty (59 RR 203).\n\nPetetan told Ali that he had a relative in Louisiana who was a bondsman and would\n\nhelp Ali get out of jail (59 RR 204). When Ali asked Petetan to call the bondsman\n\nfor him, Petetan declined by explaining his calls were recorded and he was telling\n\nthe court he was mentally sick (59 RR 205). Upon the urging of Ali, Petetan called\n\nhis mother concerning Ali’s need for a bond (59 RR 205).\n\n\n      Ali testified he was familiar with Petetan’s lawyer, Russ Hunt, through\n\nPetetan (59 RR 207-208). Ali admitted he told the State of his conversations with\n\nPetetan at the urging of the lawyer representing him on a pending drug charge (59\n\nRR 208). Those revelations came about 10 days before Ali’s testimony at\n\nPetetan’s trial (59 RR 208). Ali’s drug charge remained pending at the time of\n\nPetetan’s trial (59 RR 200). Ali was the State’s only rebuttal witness and final\n\nwitness in the punishment phase of trial (59 RR 209).\n\n\n                                       - 101 -\n\f      Ordinarily, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\n\ndefendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that counsel's\n\nperformance (1) was so deficient that it fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and (2) prejudiced the defense, meaning there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's errors, the outcome of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). However,\n\nwhen an applicant claims that ineffective assistance resulted from a conflict of\n\ninterest, the Strickland test does not apply. Acosta v. State, 233 S.W.3d 349, 356\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Instead, the defendant must show that (1) counsel had an\n\nactual, not merely potential, conflict of interest and (2) that conflict adversely\n\naffected counsel's performance. Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 349 (1980).\n\n\n      An actual conflict exists when “counsel is required to make a choice\n\nbetween advancing his client's interest in a fair trial or advancing other interests ...\n\nto the detriment of his client's interest.” Acosta, 233 S.W.3d at 355. A showing of\n\na potential conflict of interest is not sufficient to constitute an actual conflict of\n\ninterest. Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 350; Ex Parte McFarland, 163 S.W.3d 743, 759 n.52\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2005). “The petitioner must specifically identify instances in the\n\nrecord that reflect that his counsel made a choice between possible alternative\n\ncourses of action such as eliciting (or failing to elicit) evidence helpful to one\n\nclient but harmful to another.” Perillo v. Johnson, 79 F.3d 441, 447 (5th Cir.1996)\n                                         - 102 -\n\f(quoting United States v. Fox, 613 F.2d 99, 102 (5th Cir.1980)); Gaston v. State,\n\n136 S.W.3d 315, 318 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. struck).\n\n\n      Petetan maintains the facts presented demonstrate he was denied the\n\neffective assistance of counsel due to Hunt’s representation of both Petetan and Ali\n\nas well as Hunt’s efforts to defend against the accusation he was sponsoring false\n\ntestimony concerning Petetan’s intellectual disability. Hunt was precluded from\n\ncross-examining Ali with confidential information he acquired while representing\n\nAli. The jury was left with the clear impression that someone, probably counsel,\n\nhad coached Petetan on feigning mental illness in an effort to avoid the death\n\npenalty. Such occurrence placed Hunt in the untenable position of attempting to\n\nsave Petetan’s life with an intellectual disability defense while at the same time\n\ndefending himself from implications he was sponsoring false testimony. An actual\n\nconflict of interest is shown which adversely affected Hunt’s performance during\n\nthe punishment phase of trial. A sentence of death under such circumstances\n\ncannot stand under the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Petetan is entitled to a new punishment hearing with conflict free counsel.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Ten\n\n\nThe jury’s answer to the intellectual disability special issue is against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n                                       - 103 -\n\f      A. The evidence relevant to Petetan’s intellectual disability.\n\n\n      Ramona Pitre is a public school teacher in Port Arthur (55 RR 21). In 1989,\n\nPetetan was in her in-school suspension program (55 RR 26). She does not believe\n\nPetetan is intellectually disabled;7 he just cannot follow rules and misbehaves (55\n\nRR 31). In twenty five years of teaching, she has never had a student with\n\nintellectual disability, mental problems, or mental illness in one of her classes (55\n\nRR 32).\n\n\n      Edward Cockrell is with the Jefferson County Juvenile Probation\n\nDepartment (55 RR 36). It was decided to pursue certification for prosecution as\n\nan adult after Petetan shot Fredrick Nico with a gun in March of 1992 (55 RR 50,\n\n51, and 55). Cockrell’s certification analysis was admitted into evidence (55 RR\n\n53, 62 RR SX 133). When Petetan was 16 years of age, an IQ test administered\n\nyielded a score of 64 on a child’s test and 74 on an adult test (55 RR 65, 62 RR SX\n\n133). The doctor administering the test described Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled (55 RR 66).\n\n\n      Records from the former Texas Youth Commission regarding Petetan were\n\nadmitted into evidence (55 RR 87, 62 RR SX 128). The records state Petetan’s\n\n\n7\n  Pitre was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nher qualification to answer, or her answer.\n                                       - 104 -\n\fdate of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR 128). Those records reflect a previous IQ\n\nscore of 61 for Petetan from the Port Arthur Independent School District when he\n\nwas admitted to TYC at the age of 15 in 1991 (62 RR SX 128). The records\n\nfurther note that on November 7, 1991, Dr. Antonio Bartonico made reference to a\n\nprevious diagnosis of possible mild intellectual disability (62 SX 128). While at\n\nthe Brownwood State School, Petetan was diagnosed with mild intellectual\n\ndisability (62 RR SX 128).\n\n\n      The juvenile certification proceedings related to Petetan were admitted into\n\nevidence and published to the jury (55 RR 82, 62 RR SX 130). The exhibit reflects\n\nPetetan’s date of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Leonard Cucolo testified that Petetan was received by the Brownwood State\n\nSchool in 1991 after his juvenile probation for burglary was revoked (55 RR 84,\n\n87). He was at the Brownwood School for four months before returning to Port\n\nArthur on juvenile parole (55 RR 93). While housed at the Brownwood School,\n\nPetetan was diagnosed as mildly intellectually disabled (55 RR 103, 62 SX 128).\n\n\n      On March 21, 1992, Fredrick Nico was at Petetan’s house in Port Arthur\n\ndrinking beer in the backyard (55 RR 124). While at Petetan’s house, Petetan\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 105 -\n\fpointed a pistol at Nico and shot him twice (55 RR 128). Nico has known Petetan\n\nfor 25 years and does not consider him to be intellectually disabled (55 RR 134).8\n\n\n      The pen packets from Petetan’s five prior felony convictions were admitted\n\ninto evidence (55 RR 217, 62 RR SX 131). He was received at the Department of\n\nCorrections when he was 17 years of age on August 27, 1993 (62 RR SX 131).\n\nPrison records reflected his IQ testing was scored at 69 with a notation he was\n\nexpelled following the eighth grade (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Morris Lee was Petetan’s principal in elementary school (56 RR 44).\n\nPetetan was frequently sent to Lee’s office because he did not follow school rules\n\n(56 RR 45). According to Lee, Petetan had no mental disabilities other than being\n\nhard-headed (56 RR 51).9\n\n\n      Ophelia Ortiz is Petetan’s mother (56 RR 107). As an infant, Petetan would\n\nconstantly cry and pitch a fit (56 RR 112-113). While upset, he would break his\n\nbaby bottles (56 RR 112). His temper tantrums started as a baby and have never\n\nsubsided (56 RR 121).\n\n8\n  Nico was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nhis qualification to answer, or his answer.\n9\n  Lee was not provided with a definition of “mental disabilities” or shown to be\ncompetent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question, his\nqualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                      - 106 -\n\f      Petetan has wet the bed since childhood and still does so (56 RR 114). He\n\nwas slow as a child and his mother had to repeatedly tell him to bathe (56 RR 115).\n\nHe was unable to take care of himself as a child and unable to tie his shoes (56 RR\n\n116). As a child, he was unable to dress himself or brush his teeth (56 RR 116).\n\nHe did not follow her directions (56 RR 118).\n\n\n      She had to walk with him to school because if he went by himself, he would\n\nget lost or go the wrong way (56 RR 117). He did not do his school homework (56\n\nRR 118). She could never send him to the store because he could not remember\n\nwhat he was to purchase (56 RR 171). He never learned to make change when\n\npurchasing an item (56 RR 171).\n\n\n      After his best childhood friend, “Pee Wee,” died, his nervousness and\n\ndepression increased (56 RR 120). Petetan had no interest in television or games\n\nas a child (56 RR 122). He would simply sit on the floor or go walking without\n\nfirst telling his mother where he was going (56 RR 122). He was committed to a\n\npsychiatric hospital at age 15 before he went to the Brownwood State School (56\n\nRR 128).\n\n\n      Petetan was never able to get a driver’s license because he was unable to\n\npass the written portion of the test (56 RR 123). After he left prison, he could not\n\ntake care of himself (56 RR 124). Her daughter, Petetan’s sister, would clean and\n\n                                       - 107 -\n\fwash his clothes because he could not operate a washing machine (56 RR 124).\n\nHe was unable to figure out how to operate a cell phone (56 RR 125). He never\n\nlearned to wash dishes (56 RR 127).\n\n\n      Sabrina Mouton, Petetan’s older sister, testified that up to age two, Petetan\n\nwould cry constantly, wet himself, and not pay attention (56 RR 182). He didn’t\n\nwalk until three years old or talk until four or five years old (56 RR 184).\n\n\n      Growing up, Petetan would not play outside with his sister; he just wandered\n\naround the neighborhood aimlessly by himself (56 RR 185). He never watched\n\ntelevision or played games (56 RR 186). He was fat as a child and teased by others\n\n(56 RR 187). He never learned to ride a bicycle (56 RR 188).\n\n\n      When Petetan came home from prison, she tried to teach him how to use a\n\ncell phone and he could not learn (56 RR 193). He never learned to count money\n\n(56 RR 198). His handwriting is poor (56 RR 201). At the apartment he obtained\n\nwhile on parole, Petetan did not know how to cook for himself or clean up after\n\nhimself (56 RR 197).\n\n\n      Cathy Gauthier, Petetan’s aunt from Lake Charles, testified that Petetan\n\nlived with her for a year when he was 13 or 14 years old (56 RR 241, 244). He\n\nwas real quiet and slower than her children (56 RR 245-246). Petetan did not\n\nattend school for the year he spent with Gauthier (56 RR 251).\n                                       - 108 -\n\f        Petetan’s cousin, Caston Gauthier, visited Petetan while he was in prison (56\n\nRR 26). When Petetan told Gauthier that he wanted to be a bondsman or rapper\n\nupon release from prison, Gauthier thought Petetan did not have the intellectual\n\nability to engage in such professions (56 RR 263-264). He never thought Petetan\n\nwas intellectually disabled (56 RR 265).10\n\n\n        Kimberly Jackson is Petetan’s cousin and the daughter of Cathy Gauthier\n\n(56 RR 272). She and Petetan are the same age (56 RR 272). She remembered\n\nthat when Petetan was living with her family, he was not on her level “mind-wise”\n\nand intellectually slower than her (56 RR 272, 274).\n\n\n        Thomas Kemper is Petetan’s uncle (56 RR 276). Petetan has been\n\nintellectually slow since birth (56 RR 279). He was in special education classes in\n\nschool (56 RR 280). As a child, Petetan refused to bathe or groom himself (56 RR\n\n281).\n\n\n        Dr. Ray Coxe is a psychologist from Beaumont (56 RR 313). In 1992, he\n\nwas performing psychological examinations for the court system in Jefferson\n\nCounty in connection with whether juveniles should be certified as adults for\n\npurposes of prosecution (56 RR 315). He examined Petetan at the request of the\n\n10\n   Gauthier was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, his qualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                        - 109 -\n\fjuvenile probation department in connection with a pending attempted murder\n\ncharge in an effort to determine whether Petetan should be certified as an adult (56\n\nRR 316-317). Petetan was 16 years of age at the time of the examination (56 RR\n\n316).\n\n\n        In view of his age, Coxe administered IQ tests for both children and adults to\n\nPetetan (56 RR 318). He explained the child test goes up to age 17 while the adult\n\ntest goes down to age 16 (56 RR 318). Petetan’s full scale IQ on the child version\n\nwas 64 which places him in the lower three percentile (56 RR 322). Petetan’s full\n\nscale IQ on the adult test was 74 which places him in the lower four percent (56\n\nRR 323). Due to testing differences between the two tests, it is not unusual for the\n\nadult test to be 10 points higher than the child test (56 RR 323).\n\n\n        Coxe also administered achievement tests to Petetan (56 RR 354). The tests\n\nare scored like an IQ test (56 RR 354). Petetan scored 70 on reading, 61 on\n\nspelling, and 46 on mathematics (56 RR 354). Based on testing and evaluation in\n\n1992, Coxe believed Petetan to be mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n\n\n        Dr. Harold Scott, a psychiatrist, was previously a consultant for the Texas\n\nYouth Commission at the Brownwood State School (57 RR 40. 43). He examined\n\nPetetan at the school in 1991 when Petetan was 15 years old (57 RR 45). Scott\n\ndiagnosed Petetan with a conduct disorder and mild intellectual disability (57 RR\n\n                                        - 110 -\n\f53). Scott explained that mild intellectual disability meant an IQ score between 55\n\nand 69 (57 RR 55). The diagnosis was based in part on previous IQ testing of\n\nPetetan (57 RR 56).\n\n\n      Edmond Stewart is a former professional boxer (57 RR 92). For the last five\n\nyears, he has been a pastor at a jail ministry in the McLennan County Jail (57 RR\n\n95). Stewart met with Petetan in jail and found it hard to have a conversation with\n\nhim because his mind tends to “wander off” (57 RR 98).\n\n\n      Ellis Craig is a psychologist with 47 years of experience working in the area\n\nof adaptive behavior assessments (58 RR 7). He performed an adaptive behavior\n\nassessment of Petetan by administering a test, reviewing records, and speaking\n\nwith Petetan’s relatives (58 RR 18, 34, and 38).\n\n\n      Craig explained that adaptive behavior involves the ability to “get along” in\n\neveryday life and the ability to do things everyone else is able to do (58 RR 19).\n\nWhen conducting an assessment, he measures social skills, conceptual skills, and\n\npractical skills (58 RR 19-20). Conceptual skills include language, numbers, and\n\ntime (58 RR 20). Social skills involve interpersonal relationships, social\n\nresponsibility, gullibility, and naiveté (58 RR 22). Practical skills involve daily\n\nliving, hygiene, feeding, use of money, and the ability to follow schedules and\n\nroutines (58 RR 23). Fighting, arguing, and a lack of cooperation are more\n\n                                        - 111 -\n\fcommon among those with intellectual disability than the general population (58\n\nRR 24). The testing is conducted in such a way that the score of 100 is average and\n\na score of 70 or below would indicate significant limitations in adaptive behavior\n\n(58 RR 21).\n\n\n       Craig used the ABAS-II assessment test when seeking to determine\n\nretrospectively whether Petetan had adaptive behavior deficits in his\n\ndevelopmental period (58 RR 33-34). The test measures adaptive behavior in a\n\nnumber of areas including: communication; community use; functional academics;\n\nhome living; health; safety; leisure; self-care; self-direction; and social (58 RR 35).\n\n\n       When speaking with Petetan’s relatives, Craig sought to determine adaptive\n\nbehavior before the time Petetan went to prison at 17 years of age (58 RR 67).\n\nMost of the answers provided to his questions were examples of adaptive deficits\n\nfrom the time Petetan was a youth of 14 or 15 years old and had not yet gone to\n\nprison (58 RR 68). Craig believed Petetan was forthcoming with him during the\n\nassessment and did not intentionally attempt to underestimate his abilities (58 RR\n\n39).\n\n\n       The information gathered from Petetan’s relatives was graded for adaptive\n\ndisabilities (58 RR 40). The information from Petetan’s mother placed Petetan so\n\nlow that Craig did not consider it reliable (58 RR 40). Petetan’s brother and sister\n\n                                        - 112 -\n\franked his social skills as the best, conceptual skills the second best, and practical\n\nskills at the lowest level (58 RR 41).\n\n\n      The scoring of adaptive assessment is similar to scoring on an IQ test with\n\nthe norm in the 85 to 115 range (58 RR 42). The results of the assessment done by\n\nCraig were based on input from Petetan and his relatives and the scores were as\n\nfollows: brother 53; uncle and sister 47; Petetan 42; and Petetan’s mother 40 (58\n\nRR 40).\n\n\n      Craig summarized some of the adaptive behavior limitations he found during\n\ntesting and information supplied by informant relatives in the following manner:\n\n\n      [H]e was easily led by other people, that the basic social skills of\n      being polite and offering to help people, he simply doesn't do it. He\n      doesn't say thank you. He doesn't give gifts. He doesn't offer\n      assistance to people. And this was a uniform finding too.\n\n      He didn't engage in games. The only games we ever heard that he\n      played were with a cousin who played Hide and Seek with him, and\n      this was when he was older, too. But he simply didn't understand any\n      kind of simple kind of games that, you know, kids play.\n\n      He showed no interest in most -- what a lot of people use for leisure,\n      which is TV. I mean, he has consistently over the years never shown\n      the least bit of interest in TV.\n\n      [He has] very limited conversational skills. It's really hard to engage\n      in a conversation with him. He just won't follow the conversation.\n      You can't get a response to what you're saying.\n\n      In terms of getting along in the world, it was routinely noted that he\n      was unable to read menus. I mean, he would have to order things -- if\n                                       - 113 -\n\fhe went out to, you know, a fast food restaurant or something, he\nwould have to order by the picture, just saying what he knew it was.\n\nHe could not calculate the correct change. And you really couldn't\ndepend on him time-wise. He was irresponsible regarding time\ncommitments.\n\nAgain, in his neighborhood he could get along just fine. I mean, he\nknew how to find places. He couldn't necessarily tell you street\nnames, but he knew where things were geographically. He could make\nsimple meals for himself, and this was kind of like a little\nidiosyncratic thing about him.\n\nHe never learned to use a fork. I mean, he would sometimes use a\nspoon, but every bit of food that you gave him, he would wrap up in\nbread. That's how he ate. I mean, he made a sandwich out of\neverything. So in terms of the typical or just lack of ability, he didn't\ndo. It's fairly common for people, even with mild mental retardation,\nto have difficulties cutting their food into bite-size portions.\nSomebody may have to do that for them. I'm not sure if that was the\ncase with him, because he didn't use a knife. He just used a spoon.\n\nHe was able to take medications. He was able to swallow them. He\ndidn't resist that. And he could dress himself. He didn't necessarily\ndress himself well, but he could do the physical act.\n\nEven though he could get around the community, he was unable to\nuse a map. He relied on the ability to -- either people tell him familiar\nlocations or whatever, and he got lost fairly easily.\n\nHe did not do housekeeping. He was described as a terrible\nhousekeeper and never made his own bed, was unable to learn how to\noperate most common appliances, broke microwaves because he\ndidn't know how to use them, put the wrong things in them, had no\nconception about how to use a washer or a dryer.\n\nAnd even in the area of first aid, I mean, when asked what he would\ndo if he cut his finger, he said he would sop it up. \"Sop the blood up,\"\nthat was his response. So he didn't -- he just wasn't worried that way\n\n                                  - 114 -\n\f      where he would know to put a Band-Aid and some Bactine or\n      something on it (58 RR 43-47).\n\n      He doesn't understand jokes. I mean, it's too complex. You know, I\n      asked him, you know, \"Do people tell you things that make you\n      laugh,\" and he said, \"No.\"\n\n\n      Adaptive behavior strengths as found by Craig included:\n\n\n      He got along well with family members. He could navigate his\n      community pretty well. He could present himself in a reasonably good\n      -- I mean, you know, although his personal hygiene was not\n      particularly good, he dressed and he could blend in with the\n      neighborhood. It may be that in that environment he was not really\n      that atypical in terms of how he dressed and his personal hygiene. I\n      don't really know.\n\n      He had good social skills in general. I mean, he could make friends\n      and he could hang out with a group that he felt comfortable with (58\n      RR 97).\n\n\n      Based on the test results he obtained, Craig concluded Petetan’s adaptive\n\nlimitations far outweigh his limited skills (58 RR 47). Craig had to rely on\n\nretrospective assessments because there was no measure from when Petetan was a\n\nchild other than one report noting his adaptive limitations without concurrent\n\ntesting (58 RR 48). Based on his adaptive behavior deficits and the IQ scores he\n\nhas seen, Craig considers Petetan to be moderately intellectually disabled which is\n\nmore severe than mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 48).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 115 -\n\f      Dr. Kevin Correia, a psychologist, examined Petetan on August 8, 2012, in\n\nconnection with an application for Social Security disability benefits (58 RR 104,\n\n63 RR DX 5). Correia administered an IQ test resulting in a full scale score of 55\n\n(58 RR 104, 63 RR DX 5). Correia diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled in view of his IQ score and adaptive behavior deficits (58 RR 104, 63 RR\n\nDX 5).\n\n\n      Joan Mayfield is a neuropsychologist (58 RR 105). While Petetan was in\n\nthe McLennan County Jail awaiting trial, she administered 16 different tests to him\n\n(58 RR 124). Multiple tests, rather than simply an IQ test, were administered to\n\ndetermine how Petetan’s whole brain was functioning across a number of different\n\nareas (58 RR 170). The tests covered areas such as IQ, intellectual ability,\n\nattention, executive functioning, academic achievement, memory, learning,\n\nlanguage, visual spatial, and motor coordination (58 RR 117). She did not perform\n\nany adaptive behavior assessment testing and relied on the testing by Dr. Craig (58\n\nRR 231). She thought Petetan gave his best effort during the testing she\n\nadministered (58 RR 186).\n\n\n      Mayfield explained that one of the components of intellectual disability is\n\nsub-average intellectual functioning as shown by a full scale IQ score of 70 or\n\nbelow, namely, two standard deviations below the mean (58 RR 129). She also\n\n\n                                       - 116 -\n\fconsidered and looked for evidence of an onset of the condition before the age of\n\n18 (58 RR 132).\n\n\n      Mayfield was provided access to various records including Petetan’s school\n\nrecords and previous psychological testing (58 RR 133). She noted Petetan was\n\nrequired to repeat both the third and sixth grades in school (58 RR 133). He was\n\nsocially promoted to the fourth grade rather than being required to repeat the third\n\ngrade for the second time (58 RR 133). He ultimately dropped out of school in the\n\nninth grade (58 RR 220).\n\n\n      Her testing of Petetan revealed global delays in intellectual ability,\n\nacademic, executive functioning, problem solving, memory, language, motor\n\nskills, and visual perception (58 RR 185). He suffers from sub-average intellectual\n\nfunctioning with an onset before the age of 18 (58 RR 185-186). Her testing\n\nrevealed a full scale IQ score of 52 (58 RR 135). The IQ testing results were\n\nconsistent with previous IQ testing results of Petetan she was provided (58 RR\n\n186, 244). Mayfield explained that different scores may be obtained on different\n\nversions of the same test (58 RR 243).\n\n\n      She explained that at the time Coxe administered the child and adult\n\nversions of an IQ test to Petetan, there was a problem in correlating the results and\n\nthose scoring on the lower end of child’s IQ test typically scored 10 to 15 points\n\n                                         - 117 -\n\fhigher on the adult version (58 RR 228). When the tests were revised, the norms\n\nfor the tests were adjusted and there is now greater reliability between the two tests\n\nso that the scores are now similar (58 RR 228). She believed Coxe found the\n\nchild’s score of 64 to be more reliable than the adult score of 74 and that is the\n\nreason he diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 228).\n\n\n      Although she did not perform any adaptive behavior limitations assessment,\n\non cross-examination, Mayfield was asked questions concerning adaptive behavior\n\nlimitations in relation to the Briseno factors created by this Court in relation to\n\nadaptive behavior (58 RR 232). She noted that her role was not that of assessing\n\nadaption functioning because Dr. Craig had taken on that role (58 RR 233, 236).\n\nNevertheless, she assumed that facts within a hypothetical posed by the prosecutor\n\nconcerning the instant cause would show an ability to hide facts and material\n\nevidence (58 RR 236). She assumed an ability to lie about a companion would\n\nshow an ability to lie in anticipation of being arrested (58 RR 236). Although not\n\npresent for Petetan’s trial testimony, based on the prosecutor’s representations of\n\nthat testimony, she assumed the ability to respond coherently to questions (58 RR\n\n237). Based on Petetan’s criminal history, as represented by the prosecutor, he has\n\nthe ability to act alone in criminal conduct (58 RR 238). Based on the facts of the\n\ninstant offense as represented by the prosecutor, Petetan was not working under the\n\n\n\n                                        - 118 -\n\fdirections of others at the time of the offense (58 RR 238). The defense rested on\n\npunishment (58 RR 248).\n\n\n      Dorothy Stamps is a retired public school teacher from Port Arthur (59 RR\n\n45). Petetan was in her first grade class (59 RR 50). She did not believe him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 50).11\n\n\n      Eddie Fowler was the principal of the middle school attended by Petetan (59\n\nRR 59). Petetan was placed in special education classes because he was a\n\ndiscipline problem (59 RR 63). Otherwise, he was an average student and not\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 63-64).12\n\n\n      Petetan’s school records were admitted into evidence (59 RR 69, 63 RR DX\n\n10). Those records reflect he failed two grades and was socially promoted in\n\nanother grade (59 RR 66). He withdrew from school in the eighth grade (63 RR\n\nDX 10).\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Stamps was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, her qualification to answer, or her answer.\n\n12\n   Fowler was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, his qualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                        - 119 -\n\f      Mattie Howe was Petetan’s parole officer in Beaumont from May to\n\nSeptember of 2012 (59 RR 70-71). Howe does not believe Petetan is intellectually\n\ndisabled (59 RR 75).13\n\n\n      Travis Turner works for the Classification Department of TDCJ (59 RR 80).\n\nWhen Petetan was initially received at TDCJ in 1993, he scored a 69 on an IQ test\n\n(59 RR 85). He took an adaptive behavior screening test, but was never assigned\n\nto a prison unit for intellectually disabled offenders (59 RR 85-86).\n\n\n      B. The trial court’s charge on intellectual disability.\n\n\n      At the close of the punishment phase, the trial court presented a charge to the\n\njury (60 RR 5, 4 CR 1330). With respect to the issue of intellectual disability, the\n\ncourt charged the jury as follows:\n\n\n      \"You are instructed that in answering Special Issue Number 3, you\n      shall answer yes or no.\n\n      \"The Defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\n      evidence that Special Issue Number 3 should be answered yes.\n\n      \"By the term 'preponderance of the evidence' is meant the greater\n      weight of the credible evidence.\n\n\n\n13\n   Howe was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nher qualification to answer, or her answer.\n\n                                       - 120 -\n\f      \"You may not answer Special Issue Number 3 unless you agree --\n      you may not answer Special Issue Number 3 yes unless you agree\n      unanimously.\n\n      \"You may not answer Special Issue Number 3 no unless you agree\n      unanimously.\n\n      \"In deliberating on Special Issue Number 3, you shall consider all\n      evidence admitted at the guilt/innocence stage and the punishment\n      stage of this trial.\n\n      \"Mental retardation14 is a disability characterized by:\n      \"1. Significant subaverage general intellectual functioning;15\n\n      \"2. Accompanied by related limitations in adaptive functioning;16\n\n      \"3. The onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18.\n\n14\n   The trial court sustained the State’s objection to the use of the term “intellectual\ndisability” rather than “mental retardation” during trial (57 RR 109-110). See Hall\nv. Florida, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 134 S.Ct. 1986, 1991, 188 L.Ed.2d 1007 (2014)\n(“Previous opinions of this Court have employed the term ‘mental retardation.’\nThis opinion uses the term ‘intellectual disability’ to describe the identical\nphenomenon.”). The term “mentally retarded” has been changed to “intellectually\ndisabled,” as mental health advocates decided that the former term had pejorative\nconnotations. Ex parte Cathey, 451 S.W.3d 1, 5 n.4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014). See\nTEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE§ 591.003(13) (providing mental retardation\nmeans intellectual disability).\n15\n  No objection was voiced by counsel to the trial court’s failure to include the\ninstruction that significant subaverage intellectual functioning is generally\nevidenced by an IQ of 70 or below. Likewise, counsel did not request an\ninstruction or object to the lack of a definition of “significant subaverage general\nintellectual functioning” (4 CR 1313).\n16\n  No objection was voiced by counsel to the trial court’s use of the term “adaptive\nfunctioning” rather than “adaptive behavior.” Counsel also failed to object to the\nabsence of a definition for the term “adaptive behavior” or request a definition of\nthe term (4 CR 1313). See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE § 591.003(1).\n\n                                        - 121 -\n\f      \"You are instructed that if you return a negative finding, that is, a no\n      answer, to Special Issue Number 2, then and only then --\" that should\n      be \"Special Issue Number 3,\" ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to\n      correct the copy here, if you want to correct yours.\n\n      \"You are instructed that if you return a negative finding, that is a no\n      answer, to Special Issue Number 3, then and only then are you to\n      answer Special Issue Number 4 (60 RR 7-9).\n\n      \"Special Issue Number 3: Do you find, taking into consideration all\n      of the evidence, that the Defendant is a person with mental\n      retardation?\"\n\n      If the answer is unanimous, and it has to be unanimous for a yes or a\n      no answer, it should be signed by the Presiding Juror (60 RR 14).\n      Ultimately, the jury returned a “no” answer to the third special issue (60 RR\n\n68, 4 CR 1338). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, Petetan was\n\nsentenced to death in open court (60 RR 71).\n\n\n      C. The standard of review and burden of proof.\n\n\n      In Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 321 (2002), the United States Supreme\n\nCourt decided that it violates the United States Constitution for a state to execute a\n\nmentally retarded murderer. The Court simultaneously left to the individual states\n\nthe substantive and procedural mechanisms to implement the Atkins decision.\n\nAtkins, 536 U.S. at 317.\n\n\n      In view in the absence of legislation and the Atkins decision, this Court\n\nadopted the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) definition of\n\n                                        - 122 -\n\fmental retardation for Atkins claims presented in Texas death-penalty cases. See Ex\n\nparte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1, 7–8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The AAMR defines\n\nmental retardation as a disability characterized by: (1) “significantly subaverage”\n\ngeneral intellectual functioning, which is usually evidenced by an IQ “of about 70”\n\nor below,17 (2) accompanied by “related” limitations in adaptive functioning,18 (3)\n\nthe onset of which occurs prior to the age of 18. See id;.19 see also Ex parte\n\nTennard, 960 S.W.2d 57, 61 (Tex.Cr.App.1997) (third part of AAMR definition\n\n17\n     See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n.24.\n18\n   See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7 n. 25 (“Impairments in adaptive behavior are\ndefined as significant limitations in an individual's effectiveness in meeting the\nstandards of maturation, learning, personal independence, and/or social\nresponsibility that are expected for his or her age level and cultural group, as\ndetermined by clinical assessment and, usually, standardized scales.”) (internal\nquotes omitted).\n19\n  In Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 7–8, we also adopted the definition of mental\nretardation contained in the Texas Health and Safety Code, which, similar to the\nAAMR definition, defines mental retardation as “significantly subaverage general\nintellectual functioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and\noriginates during the developmental period.” See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE\n§ 591.003(13).\nThe most recent amendment to the Texas Health and Safety Code definition of\n“mental retardation” defines it as “intellectual disability,” and it defines\n“intellectual disability” as “significantly subaverage general intellectual\nfunctioning that is concurrent with deficits in adaptive behavior and originates\nduring the developmental period.” TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE §§\n591.003(13) & (7–a). See In re Allen, 462 S.W.3d 47, 56 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015)\n(Yeary, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 123 -\n\frequires a person to exhibit parts one and two of the AAMR definition during the\n\ndevelopmental period).\n\n\n      This Court used Briseno to “define [from its own perspective] that level and\n\ndegree of mental retardation at which a consensus of Texas citizens would agree\n\nthat a person should be exempted from the death penalty.” Id. at 6. The Court\n\nrecognized that, the term “mental retardation” as defined in the DSM–IV included\n\nthose categorized as mildly, moderately, severely, and profoundly mentally\n\nretarded, and that “some 85% of those officially categorized as mentally retarded\n\nfall into” the mildly mentally retarded range. Id. at 5. The Court observed that\n\n“mental retardation is not necessarily a lifelong disorder.” Id. at 6. And it noted\n\nthat “those in the mental health profession” might understandably “define mental\n\nretardation broadly to provide an adequate safety net for those who are at the\n\nmargin” and who “might well become mentally-unimpaired citizens if given\n\nadditional social services support.” Id. The Court questioned whether “a consensus\n\nof Texas citizens” would agree “that all persons who might legitimately qualify for\n\nassistance under the social services definition of mental retardation” should be\n\n“exempt from an otherwise constitutional penalty.” Id. But in the absence of\n\nlegislative guidance, it adopted the definitions of “mental retardation” then\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 124 -\n\fpromulgated by the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR)20 and\n\nsection 591.003(13) of the Texas Health and Safety Code. Id. Those definitions\n\nwere very similar.\n\n\n      In Briseno, the Court stated the adaptive behavior criteria are exceedingly\n\nsubjective, and undoubtedly experts will be found to offer opinions on both sides\n\nof the issue in most cases. Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8. Seemingly from whole cloth\n\nand without scientific, clinical, or other authority, the Court declared there are\n\nother evidentiary factors which factfinders in the criminal trial context might also\n\nfocus upon in weighing evidence as indicative of mental retardation or of a\n\npersonality disorder:\n\n\n      Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage—\n      his family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities—think he was\n20\n  The Supreme Court referred to the AAMR definition of mental retardation in\nAtkins. 536 U.S. at 308 n.3 & 317 n.22. That organization has now changed its\nname to the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities\n(AAIDD). The Supreme Court also referred to the American Psychiatric\nAssociation (APA) definition of mental retardation as it was then described in the\nFourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM\nIV–TR): “The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage\ngeneral intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant\nlimitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following skill areas:\ncommunication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of\ncommunity resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure,\nhealth, and safety (Criterion B). The onset must occur before age 18 years\n(Criterion C).” American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders p. 41 (4th ed. 2000). See In re Allen, 462 S.W.3d 47,\n56 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015) (Yeary, J., concurring).\n\n                                        - 125 -\n\f      mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that\n      determination?\n\n      Has the person formulated plans and carried them through or is his\n      conduct impulsive?\n\n      Does his conduct show leadership or does it show that he is led\n      around by others?\n\n      Is his conduct in response to external stimuli rational and appropriate,\n      regardless of whether it is socially acceptable?\n\n      Does he respond coherently, rationally, and on point to oral or written\n      questions or do his responses wander from subject to subject?\n\n      Can the person hide facts or lie effectively in his own or others'\n      interests?\n\n      Putting aside any heinousness or gruesomeness surrounding the\n      capital offense, did the commission of that offense require\n      forethought, planning, and complex execution of purpose?\n      See Briseno, 135 S.W.3d at 8.\n\n\n      This Court has decided that a defendant, presenting an Atkins intellectual\n\ndisability claim at trial, has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat he is intellectually disabled. See Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 112, 114 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2008); Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 769–70 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2007). When reviewing a defendant’s assertion the jury’s rejection of an issue is\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence, an appellate court\n\nviews the entirety of the evidence in a neutral light, and may not usurp the function\n\nof the jury by substituting its judgment in place of the jury's assessment of the\n\n                                       - 126 -\n\fweight and credibility of the witnesses' testimony. Matlock v. State, 392 S.W.3d\n\n662, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013). A finding rejecting a defendant's issue upon\n\nwhich he had the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence cannot be\n\noverruled unless, after setting out the relevant evidence supporting the verdict, the\n\ncourt clearly states why the verdict is so much against the great weight of the\n\nevidence as to be manifestly unjust, conscience-shocking, or clearly biased.\n\nButcher v. State, 454 S.W.3d 13, 20 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). Thus, in reviewing a\n\njury's finding that a defendant is not intellectually disabled, it is appropriate to\n\nconsider all of the evidence relevant to the intellectual disability issue and\n\ndetermine, with “great deference” to the jury's finding, whether this finding is “so\n\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence so as to be manifestly\n\nunjust.” See Neal v. State, 256 S.W.3d 264, 273 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (noting\n\nappellate court affords “great deference” to jury's finding that defendant is not\n\nintellectually disabled because jury is in the best position to assess witness\n\ncredibility and to resolve conflicts in the evidence); Williams, 270 S.W.3d at 114;\n\nGallo, 239 S.W.3d at 769–70.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 127 -\n\f     D. This Court’s flawed practice when reviewing sufficiency of the evidence\n\nclaims relative to showing intellectual disability by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.21\n\n\n        This Court routinely applies the Briseno factors instead of clinical diagnostic\n\ncriteria to evaluate intellectual disability. As Hall v. Florida confirmed, however,\n\nclinical standards “were a fundamental premise of Atkins.” 134 S. Ct. 1986, 1999\n\n(2014). Like Florida, Texas departs from those standards in several respects,\n\nincluding by disregarding a defendant’s adaptive deficits if the defendant also\n\nexhibits adaptive strengths and by giving effect to lay stereotypes of how\n\nintellectually disabled persons ought to appear or behave. Even after Hall, this\n\nCourt has relied on that nonclinical approach to uphold death sentences when\n\ndefendants concededly meet the clinical definition of intellectual disability.\n\n\n         In contrast to this Court, the vast majority of death penalty States have\n\nmade clear that clinical standards should govern the determination of the second\n\nprong of the definition of intellectual disability; just as Hall confirmed they should\n\napply at the first prong. In cases presenting facts very similar to this one, courts in\n\nthose States have held that the Eighth Amendment forecloses the death penalty.\n\n\n\n21\n  These arguments are largely taken from a petition for writ of certiorari currently\npending before the Supreme Court in Lizcano v. Texas, No. 15-65.\n                                     - 128 -\n\f      This Court’s outlier status continues to defy the Supreme Court’s\n\nholding in Hall that “persons who meet the ‘clinical definitions’ of intellectual\n\ndisability ‘by definition’” are ineligible for the death penalty. 134 S. Ct. at 1999.\n\nThis Court invented the Briseno factors because it deemed the clinical diagnostic\n\ncriteria too “subjective.” Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.W.3d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2004). Briseno cited no authority for these factors—scientific or otherwise— and\n\noffered n o g u i d a n c e on h o w t h e y s h o u l d be weighed. Id. at 8-9. No\n\nclinical authority supports them.    Yet Briseno’s standard governs all Atkins\n\nclaims in Texas, even after Hall. E.g., In re Allen, 462 S.W.3d 47, 51-52 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2015). Applying that standard, this Court has sustained death sentences even\n\nwhere defendants meet clinical definitions of intellectual disability.\n\n\n    The Briseno factors do not merely “flesh out the AAMR definition” of\n\nintellectual disability. Chester v. Thaler, 666 F.3d 340, 346 (5th Cir. 2011). They\n\nsupplant it. Texas’s approach presents “an array of divergences from the clinical\n\ndefinitions.” Blume et al., Of Atkins and Men, 18 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 689,\n\n712 (2009). It is concededly “non-diagnostic.” Ex parte Van Alstyne, 239\n\nS.W.3d 815, 820 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (per curiam). It “bear[s] no\n\nresemblance to the AAMR or APA adaptive functioning criteria.” Chester, 666 F.3d\n\nat 361 (Dennis, J., dissenting). And it invites “factfinders in Texas to adjust the\n\nclinical criteria … to conform to their own normative judgments with respect to\n                                        - 129 -\n\fwhich mentally retarded offenders are deserving of the death penalty and which are\n\nnot.” Lizcano v. State, 2010 WL 1817772, at *35 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (Price,\n\nJ., concurring and dissenting).\n\n\n       Strengths and weaknesses. Clinicians recognize that “adaptive skill\n\nlimitations often coexist w i t h strengths.” AAIDD Manual 45. Observed\n\nlimitations in one area therefore cannot be “outweighed” by potential strengths in\n\nothers. Id. at 47. Under clinical standards, meeting minimum thresholds for deficits\n\nyields a diagnosis of intellectual disability, regardless whether a defendant is\n\n“competent in other adaptive domains.” Greenspan, The Briseño Factors, in The\n\nDeath Penalty and Intellectual Disability 219, 221 (Polloway ed., 2015).22\n\nThere are no “prong t w o deficits that ‘make or break’ an [intellectual-disability]\n\ndiagnosis.” Id.; see also Brumfield v. Cain, 135 S. Ct. 2269, 2281 (2015)\n\n\n\n\n22\n   Strengths in an area in which the defendant claims to have limitations are clinically\nrelevant. Clark v. Quarterman, 457 F.3d 441, 447 (5th Cir. 2006). But “[b]ecause\nlimitations define mental retardation, adaptive strengths are relevant only insofar as\nthey offset particular adaptive weaknesses.” Blume, 18 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol’y at\n707. “Unless a defendant’s evidence of particular limitations is specifically\ncontradicted by evidence that he does not have those limitations, then the defendant’s\nburden is met no matter what evidence the State might offer that he has no deficits\nin other skill areas.” Lambert v. State, 126 P.3d 646, 651 (Okla. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n                                         - 130 -\n\f(acknowledging clinical guidance explaining that “intellectually disabled persons\n\nmay have ‘strengths in … some adaptive skill areas’”).23\n\n\n      Texas courts, in contrast, have dismissed serious deficits in adaptive skills\n\nas “insignificant” when weighed against evidence of skills in unrelated areas, such\n\nas renting an apartment, purchasing a car, or washing clothing. Williams v.\n\nQuarterman, 293 F. App’x 298, 312-314 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (describing\n\nthese as “substantial adaptive strengths”); see also Wilson v. Thaler, 450 F. App’x\n\n369, 376 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Ex parte Cathey, 451 S.W.3d 1, 27 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2014); (Price, J., concurring and dissenting). Under Texas law, if a\n\nfactfinder “concludes that the [defendant] met one of the Briseno factors even in a\n\nlimited period of time or situation, the factfinder may then overlook the\n\n[defendant’s] limitations and conclude that the [defendant] is not mentally retarded.”\n\nChester, 666 F.3d at 367 (Dennis, J., dissenting).\n\n\n      Lay stereotypes. Contrary to objective clinical criteria, Texas both allows\n\nand encourages the factfinder to treat lay stereotypes as dispositive of intellectual\n\n\n23\n  In Brumfield, the Court held that the state court had reached an\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of “substantial grounds” in the\nrecord to “question [the petitioner’s] adaptive functioning,” and that the petitioner\nwas entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue in federal court. 135 S. Ct. at\n2281-2282. The Court “assume[d]” without deciding the adequacy of Louisiana’s\nadaptive-functioning standard. Id. at 2279; see also id. at 2277 n.3.\n\n\n                                         - 131 -\n\fdisability. The first Briseno factor, for instance, asks whether family or friends\n\nwho knew the defendant during his developmental stage “th[ought]” he was\n\n“mentally retarded.” 135 S.W.3d at 8. Atkins cases in Texas consequently often\n\nturn on testimony from individuals with no clinical training about whether they\n\npersonally considered the defendant “retarded.” E.g., Hunter v. State, 243\n\nS.W.3d 664, 668, 671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (defendant’s “former neighbor …\n\ndid not think there was anything wrong with [him] mentally”); Williams, 293 F.\n\nApp’x at 309 (lay witnesses “did not believe that [defendant] was mentally\n\nretarded”); Wilson, 450 F. App’x at 376 (defendant’s family and acquaintances “at\n\nmost” “considered him slow”).\n\n\n      Other Briseno factors also permit factfinders to reject an Atkins claim based on\n\n“stereotypes of what persons with intellectual disability can (and cannot) do,”\n\nBlume et al., A Tale of Two (and Possibly Three) Atkins, 23 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts.\n\nJ. 393, 405 (2014), particularly “lay stereotype[s] of … moderate or severe”\n\nintellectual disability, Greenspan 219. Whether a defendant has “formulated plans,”\n\n“respond[s] coherently” to questions, or can “hide facts or lie effectively,” Briseno,\n\n135 S.W.3d at 8, are not factors considered in any known clinical assessments.\n\nBut in Texas, this Court can simply “identify [intellectual disability] when it sees it.”\n\nEx parte Henderson, 2006 WL 167836 , at *4 (Tex. Crim. App. Jan. 25, 2006)\n\n(Cochran, J., concurring).\n                                         - 132 -\n\f       Typical performance. “Adaptive behavior … is the collection of conceptual,\n\nsocial, and practical skills that have been learned and are performed by people in their\n\neveryday lives.” AAIDD Manual 45 (emphasis added); see also DSM-5, at 33. The\n\nclinical diagnosis of deficits in adaptive functioning therefore “focuses on the\n\nindividual’s typical performance,” often assessed using a standardized diagnostic\n\ntest, rather than the individual’s “best or assumed ability or maximum\n\nperformance.” AAIDD Manual 47.\n\n\n       This Court, in contrast, both encourages and allows the factfinder to focus\n\non a particular event—the commission of the offense—regardless of whether it\n\nexemplifies behavior that is typical of the individual’s functioning in everyday life.\n\nSee, e.g., Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 777 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (“[M]any of\n\nthe Briseno factors pertain to the facts of the offense and the defendant’s behavior\n\nbefore and after the commission of the offense.”); Ex parte Taylor, 2006 WL\n\n234854, at *3-6 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006) (Johnson, J., concurring) (focusing on the\n\nfacts of the crime to deny Atkins claim); Hines v. Thaler, 456 F. App’x 357, 372\n\n(5th Cir. 2011) (similar).\n\n\n       Personality disorders. This Court’s approach also invites a clinically\n\nunfounded distinction between intellectual disability and personality disorders. The\n\nCourt treats the Briseno factors as “indicative of mental retardation or of a\n\n\n                                        - 133 -\n\fpersonality disorder.” 135 S.W. 3d at 8 (emphasis added). Some courts have\n\napplied them to conclude that adaptive deficits merely reflect personality disorder\n\n“as opposed to” intellectual disability. Ladd v. Thaler, 2013 WL 593927, at *8\n\n(E.D. Tex. Feb. 15, 2013), aff’d, 748 F.3d 637 (5th Cir. 2014). Yet clinical guidance\n\nindicates that a person can have both. “Co-occurring mental … conditions are\n\nfrequent in intellectual disability[.]” DSM-5, at 40; see also Brumfield, 135 S. Ct. at\n\n2280.\n\n\n        Relying on Briseno, this Court has rejected Atkins claims even where—as\n\nhere—the defendant appears to satisfy the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of\n\nintellectual disability. In Ex parte Sosa, this Court relied on a single Briseno factor\n\nto reverse a finding of intellectual disability. 364 S.W.3d 889, 895-896 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 2012). An expert clinician had testified in state habeas proceedings that the\n\npetitioner’s “adaptive functioning was within the lowest 1% of individuals.” Id. at\n\n892. The trial court credited and adopted that testimony. Id. at 893. This Court\n\ndeclined to grant habeas relief, relying solely on the expert’s failure to consider\n\none Briseno factor: the facts of the underlying offense. Sosa, 364 S.W.3d at 894-\n\n895; see also id. at 896 (remanding with instructions to consider that factor). In\n\nthe Court’s view, a defendant who satisfies clinical standards for deficits in\n\nadaptive functioning nonetheless might not be “less morally culpable, less responsive\n\nto deterrence, and less capable of assisting in his own defense, such that it would\n                                        - 134 -\n\fviolate the Eighth Amendment to execute him.” Id. at 892. The Court explained that\n\nthe Briseno factors address this “concern” by ensuring that, in Texas, clinical\n\nstandards will not be dispositive. Id.\n\n\n      In Ex parte Chester, this Court denied Atkins relief based solely on Briseno.\n\n2007 WL 602607, at *4 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). The Court acknowledged that\n\nthe petitioner had “demonstrat[ed] significant limitations in intellectual\n\nfunctioning.” Id. at *3. Both parties’ experts agreed that he “would be correctly\n\ndiagnosed as mildly mentally retarded” based on the results of a recognized test\n\nof adaptive functioning, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Survey. Id. Despite this\n\nclinical assessment, the Court denied relief based on the “seven evidentiary factors\n\nlisted in Briseno.” Id. at *4. The court emphasized the facts of the crime, the\n\ndefendant’s ability to converse coherently, and the defendant’s classification during\n\nhis school years as merely “learning disabled.” Id. at *4-9; see also Chester, 666\n\nF.3d at 365 (Dennis, J., dissenting) (Atkins claim denied where “the seventh Briseno\n\nfactor, and nothing else” was found to be “sufficient by itself to uphold a denial of\n\nrelief”). This Court and federal courts have similarly denied Atkins relief based in\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 135 -\n\fpart on the Briseno factors in numerous other cases despite clinical evidence of\n\nintellectual disability.24\n\n\n       This Court has refused to reconsider Briseno in light of Hall. In Hall, the\n\nSupreme Court confronted a Florida law that “define[d] intellectual disability to\n\nrequire an IQ test score of 70 or less,” without regard to the measurement error\n\ninherent in such scores. 134 S. Ct. at 1990, 1995-1996. Florida argued that Atkins\n\ngave the States “leeway” to enact “substantive definitions of mental retardation”\n\nthat did not conform to clinical definitions.\n\n\n       Hall thus addressed not simply how to interpret IQ scores, but rather “how\n\nintellectual disability must be defined in order to implement … the holding of\n\nAtkins.” 134 S. Ct. at 1993. Observing that “Atkins did not give the States\n\nunfettered discretion to define the full scope of the constitutional protection,” id. at\n\n\n24\n   See, e.g., Ex parte Clark, 2004 WL 885583, at *3 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004) (per\ncuriam); Taylor, 2006 WL 234854, at *4-5 (Johnson, J., concurring); Gallo, 239\nS.W.3d at 774; Williams v. State, 270 S.W.3d 112, 114-132 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2008); Ex parte Woods, 296 S.W.3d 587, 610-613 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Ex parte\nButler, 416 S.W.3d 863, 875-876 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (Cochran, J., concurring);\nEx parte Weathers, 2014 WL 1758977, at *8-10 (Tex. Crim. App. 2014) (Alcala,\nJ., concurring); Cathey, 451 S.W.3d at 26-28. Federal courts in Texas have denied\ncollateral relief on similar grounds. See, e.g., Wilson, 450 F. App’x at 376-377;\nRodriguez v. Quarterman, 2006 WL 1900630, at *13-14 (W.D. Tex. 2006);\nMatamoros v. Thaler, 2010 WL 1404368, at *10-15 (S.D. Tex. 2010), modified,\n2012 WL 394597 (S.D. Tex. 2012), aff’d, 783 F.3d 212 (5th Cir. 2015);\nHernandezv. Thaler, 2011 WL 4437091, at *20, *22-24 (W.D. Tex. 2011), aff’d,\n537 F. App’x 531 (5th Cir. 2013) (per curiam).\n                                        - 136 -\n\f1998, the Court held that Florida’s unscientific rule “create[d] an unacceptable\n\nrisk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed, and thus [was]\n\nunconstitutional,” id. at 1990; see also, e.g., Van Tran v. Colson, 764 F.3d 594, 612\n\n(6th Cir. 2014) (“In Hall, the Court reasoned that the Constitution requires the\n\ncourts and legislatures to follow clinical practices in defining intellectual disability.”).\n\n\n       Former Judge Price of this Court predicted soon after Hall that “the writing\n\nis on the wall for the future viability of Ex part e Briseno.” Cathey, 451 S.W.3d\n\nat 28 (concurring). Despite that prediction, the Court ignored Lizcano’s\n\nrepeated pleas to reconsider Briseno in light of Hall’s renewed emphasis on the\n\nimportance of clinical norms. See Ex parte Lizcano, 2015 WL 2085190 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2015). Likewise, the Court refused to reconsider Briseno in light of\n\nHall in Cathey as well. 451 S.W.3d at 19-20, 26-27.25\n\n\n       The Fifth Circuit has also refused to reconsider the continued validity of this\n\nCourt’s approach in light of Hall, declaring that Hall “in no way affects …\n25\n  The Supreme Court denied certiorari in Cathey, 83 U.S.L.W. 3912 (U.S. June\n22, 2015), but that case did not squarely present the question whether Hall\nforecloses continued use of the Briseno factors because the petitioner had also failed\nto meet the first prong of the definition of intellectual disability, 451 S.W.3d at 19.\nMoreover, according to the State, the Court of Criminal Appeals “relied on and\ncredited [expert] testimony—not the Briseno factors” to deny relief. Cases\ndecided by the Fifth Circuit after Hall similarly provide poor vehicles for this\nCourt to address the continued rejection of clinical criteria because they raise the issue\nonly through AEDPA’s deferential lens. E.g., Mays v. Stephens, 757 F.3d 211, 217-\n218 (5th Cir. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 951 (2015).\n\n                                          - 137 -\n\fapplication of Briseno.” Mays v. Stephens, 757 F.3d 211, 218 (5th Cir. 2014).26 The\n\ncourt reasoned that Hall “does not implicate Texas” because “the word ‘Texas’\n\nnowhere appears in the opinion” and because “no reasonable jurist could theorize\n\nthat the reasoning animating Hall could possibly be extended to Briseno.” Id. at\n\n218; see also Guevera v. Stephens, 577 F. App’x 364, 372-373 (5th Cir. 2014) (per\n\ncuriam) (following Mays); Matamoros v. Stephens, 783 F.3d 212, 218-219 (5th Cir.\n\n2015) (applying Mays to “reject[] the argument that Hall renders Briseno\n\nunconstitutional”); Henderson v. Stephens, 2015 WL 3965828, at *16 (5th Cir.\n\n2015) (Hall “does not call into question the constitutionality of the Briseno\n\nstandard”).\n\n\n      This Court continues to apply factors that have no basis in clinical practice to\n\nallow the execution of defendants whom mental health and medical professionals\n\nwould diagnose with intellectual disability. And it continues to demonstrate a\n\nreluctance to conform to the holding in Hall. This Court stands virtually alone in\n\nthis approach.\n\n\n\n\n26\n  The Fifth Circuit had endorsed Briseno against Eighth Amendment challenge on\nseveral occasions before Hall. See, e.g., Chester, 666 F.3d at 346-347 (“on their\nface, nothing about [the Briseno factors] contradicts Atkins”); Woods v.\nQuarterman, 493 F.3d 580, 587 n.6 (5th Cir. 2007) (“nothing in Briseno” is\n“inconsistent with Atkins”).\n\n\n                                        - 138 -\n\f      This Court “has clearly taken a path that differs from the other states” on\n\nthis issue. Tobolowsky, A Different Path Taken, 39 Hastings Const. L.Q. 1, 142\n\n(2011). No other state legislature or court has devised its own nonclinical evidentiary\n\nfactors to govern the evaluation of adaptive functioning for Atkins purposes. Only\n\ntwo States’ courts have even suggested approval of this Court’s Briseno approach.27\n\n\n      Many States have enacted statutory definitions of intellectual disability that\n\nincorporate established clinical definitions, including the adaptive-functioning\n\nprong. See, e.g., Idaho Code Ann. § 19-2515A(1)(a); Mo. Rev. Stat. § 565.030(6);\n\nN.C. Gen. Stat. § 15A-2005(a)(1)(b), (2); Okla. Stat. tit. 21, § 701.10b(A)(2);\n\nYbarra v. State, 247 P.3d 269, 273-275 & n.6 (Nev. 2011) (discussing Nev. Rev.\n\nStat. § 174.098(7)); Bowling v. Commonwealth, 163 S.W.3d 361, 369-370 & n.8\n\n(Ky. 2005) (discussing Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 532.130(2)). Other States have\n\nadopted clinical standards by judicial decision. See, e.g., Chase v. State, 2015 WL\n\n1848126, at *2-3 (Miss. 2015); State v. White, 885 N.E.2d 905, 907-908 (Ohio\n\n2008). Virginia requires not only a clinical definition, but also—where feasible—the\n\n\n\n27\n  An intermediate appellate court in Tennessee has cited Briseno approvingly,\nVan Tran v. State, 2006 WL 3327828, at *23-24 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2006), but\nTennessee’s highest court has not, see Coleman v. State, 341 S.W.3d 221, 248\n(Tenn. 2011). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has “adopted the clinical definitions\nof mental retardation,” but has also “approve[d] the[] use” of the Briseno factors at\nthe factfinder’s discretion. Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 58 A.3d 62, 82, 86 (Pa.\n2012); see also Commonwealth v. Bracey, 2015 WL 3751733, at *15-16 (Pa. 2015).\n                                         - 139 -\n\fuse of a standardized clinical assessment to evaluate adaptive functioning. Va. Code\n\nAnn. § 19.2-264.3:1.1(B)(2).\n\n\n      State and federal courts outside of Texas have stressed the importance of\n\nadhering to clinical guidance on adaptive functioning to reach accurate conclusions.\n\nFor example, contrary to this Court’s approach, courts have recognized that a\n\ndefendant’s possession of some adaptive skills is “in no way inconsistent with” a\n\ndiagnosis of intellectual disability, White, 885 N.E.2d at 914, because adaptive\n\ndeficits often coexist with strengths, see supra pp. 20-21. These courts have\n\nexplained that the factfinder “‘must therefore look at [the defendant’s] weaknesses\n\ninstead of at his strengths.’” Van Tran, 764 F.3d at 609; see also, e.g., Sasser v.\n\nHobbs, 735 F.3d 833, 845 (8th Cir. 2013) (“Consistent with nationally accepted\n\nclinical definitions of mental retardation, the Arkansas standard does not ask\n\nwhether an individual has adaptive strengths to offset the individual’s adaptive\n\nlimitations.”); Holladay v. Allen, 555 F.3d 1346, 1363 (11th Cir. 2009) (“Individuals\n\nwith mental retardation have strengths and weaknesses …. Indeed, the criteria for\n\ndiagnosis recognizes this by requiring a showing of deficits in only two of ten\n\nidentified areas of adaptive functioning.”); White, 885 N.E.2d at 914 (“The mentally\n\nretarded are not necessarily devoid of all adaptive skills. Indeed, ‘they may look\n\nrelatively normal in some areas and have certain significant limitations in other\n\nareas.’”); Lambert v. State, 126 P.3d 646, 651 (Okla. Crim. App. 2005) (“[T]he State\n                                        - 140 -\n\fneed not present any evidence that a capital defendant can function in areas other than\n\nthose in which a deficit is claimed.”).\n\n\n       Courts outside of Texas have also rejected reliance on the lay stereotypes that\n\nthis Court both allows and encourages factfinders to consider. In Thomas v. Allen,\n\n607 F.3d 749, 759 (11th Cir. 2010), the Eleventh Circuit rejected the State’s\n\nargument that an Atkins claimant’s ability to “drive cars and hold menial jobs”\n\nweighed against a finding of intellectual disability. And courts have emphasized the\n\nimportance of expert clinical judgment in evaluating an Atkins claim. See, e.g., Van\n\nTran, 764 F.3d at 605 (“The reliable and professionally vetted methods presented\n\nby … experts, from which the legal standards draw their substance, must guide the\n\ncourt’s inquiry.”); id. at 612 (“Tennessee law does not permit the state trial court\n\nto use its independent judgment to disregard uncontroverted expert analyses,\n\nconsider factors that the experts have testified are unreliable, or declare to be\n\ndispositive a factor irrelevant to the clinical definitions employed by the\n\nexperts.”). Factfinders in these States “may not disregard credible and\n\nuncontradicted expert testimony in favor of either the perceptions of lay witnesses or\n\nof the court’s own expectations of how a mentally retarded person would behave.”\n\nWhite, 885 N.E.2d at 915.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 141 -\n\f       The distinction between Texas’s approach and that of most other death-\n\npenalty States can make the difference between life and death in factually similar\n\ncases. In particular, defendants situated similarly to Petetan have succeeded on\n\nAtkins claims in other States. In White, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion when it denied White’s Atkins claim on the basis of\n\nlay testimony and perceived strengths. 885 N.E.2d at 915-916. Both experts at trial\n\nconcluded that White met all three prongs of the clinical definition of intellectual\n\ndisability. Id. At 909-910. To rebut evidence of adaptive deficits, the State cited\n\ntestimony from White’s ex-girlfriend that he “possessed … adaptive skills\n\ninconsistent with retardation” and “was not perceived by those who knew him as\n\nhaving significant adaptive disorders.” Id. at 911. White had bought a truck, could\n\ndrive, held a job, and dated; he also had other “skills” including playing games\n\ninvolving coordination and lying to his landlord. Id. at 910, 914. On that basis, the trial\n\ncourt concluded that White did not satisfy the adaptive-functioning prong.\n\n\n       Applying clinical standards, the state Supreme Court of Ohio reversed. 885\n\nN.E.2d at 908, 915-916. The court admonished that “rejecting the uncontradicted\n\ntestimony of two qualified expert witnesses in the field of psychology” based on\n\nlay perceptions of intellectual disability is “arbitrary [and] unreasonable.” Id. at\n\n915-916. Because “[t]he mentally retarded are not necessarily devoid of all\n\nadaptive skills,” “one must focus on those adaptive skills the person lacks, not on\n                                          - 142 -\n\fthose he possesses.” Id. at 914. The court cautioned that “laymen cannot easily\n\nrecognize” intellectual disability. Id. at 915.\n\n\n       In State v. Lombardi, the Supreme Court of Missouri prohibited the\n\nexecution of an Atkins claimant after holding that he met the adaptive-\n\nfunctioning prong based on evidence of adaptive deficits, without considering his\n\nstrengths. 303 S.W.3d 523, 526-527 (Mo. 2010) (per curiam). The defendant\n\npresented evidence that he had trouble communicating and was quiet and\n\nwithdrawn. Id. And school records indicated that the defendant had repeated tenth\n\ngrade for three consecutive years. Id. at 527. Missouri’s statutory definition of\n\nadaptive behavior mirrors the previous APA standard and requires a claimant to\n\ndemonstrate deficits in at least two of ten skill areas. Id. At 526; see also\n\nGoodwin v. State, 191 S.W.3d 20, 30-32 (Mo. 2006). Applying this standard to the\n\ndefendant’s case, the court concluded that the evidence of “deficits and limitations\n\nin two or more adaptive behaviors”— communications and functional\n\nacademics—sufficed to demonstrate the defendant’s intellectual disability regardless\n\nof any strengths in adaptive functioning. 303 S.W.3d at 527.\n\n\n       No two Atkins claimants are identical. But this Court systematically departs\n\nfrom the clinical norms that govern Atkins claims in the vast majority of other\n\nStates by giving dispositive weight to factors that have no scientific grounding. Had\n\n\n                                          - 143 -\n\fWhite or Lombardi arisen in Texas, their outcomes would almost certainly have\n\nbeen different. This Court should cease its defiance of the Supreme Court’s\n\nendorsement of the clinical standards approach to intellectual disability approved\n\nby the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall.\n\n\n      E. Petetan proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he is\n\nintellectually disabled under both the flawed Briseno approach and a clinical\n\nstandards approach as approved by the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall.\n\n\n       There should be no dispute Petetan has “‘significantly sub average general\n\nintellectual functioning’” and meets the first clinical prong of intellectual disability.\n\nHis IQ scores have consistently fallen within the range of intellectual disability.\n\nWhen he was 15 years of age, he scored a 61 on a school administered IQ test. When he\n\nwas 16 years of age, he scored a 64 on a child’s version of an IQ test and 74 on an adult\n\nversion.28 When he arrived at prison at the age of 17 he scored 69 on a prison\n\nadministered test. Following his release from prison in 2012, he scored 55 on an IQ test\n\nadministered in connection with an application for disability benefits. Finally, before\n\ntrial, he scored 52 on an IQ test administered by Dr. Mayfield.\n\n\n\n28\n   The variance in those scores with regard to a child taking the adult version and\nproblems with norming the child and versions of the test were explained by Drs.\nCoxe and Mayfield (56 RR 357 and 58 RR 228). In any case, after administering\nboth tests, Coxe diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n                                       - 144 -\n\f       The evidence of Petetan’s significant deficits in adaptive behavior is\n\noverwhelming. Achievement tests administered by Dr. Coxe in 1992 revealed deficits.\n\nDr. Craig’s testing sought to determine, retrospectively, whether Petetan suffered from\n\nadaptive behavior deficits at the ages of 14 and 15 before he went to prison at the age of\n\n17. His testing revealed significant adaptive behavior limitations far outweighing any\n\nadaptive behavior strengths. Craig was provided with a report from Petetan’s childhood\n\nnoting limitations in adaptive behavior.\n\n\n       A multitude of mental health and medical professions have diagnosed\n\nPetetan as intellectually disabled. They include Dr. Antonio Bartonico at the\n\nBrownwood School in 1991; Dr. Harold Scott at the Brownwood State School in\n\n1991; Dr. Ray Coxe in connection with juvenile certification proceedings in 1992;\n\nDr Kevin Correia in connection with an application for Social Security Disability\n\nBenefits in 2012; Dr. Ellis Craig in connection with testing performed in\n\nanticipation of the instant prosecution; and Dr. Joan Mayfield in connection with\n\ntesting performed in anticipation of the instant prosecution.29\n\n\n       Lay witnesses confirmed the experts’ diagnosis. Family members recalled\n\nPetetan’s adaptive behavior limitations from his childhood including poor hygiene;\n\n29\n   Petetan further notes that in the pretrial competency proceeding, Dr. Ollie Seay\ndiagnosed Petetan as suffering from intellectual disability (12 RR 62, 88). Petetan\nconcedes that evidence was not before the jury which answered the special issue\nconcerning intellectual disability.\n                                        - 145 -\n\fpoor school attendance and performance; inability to dress himself; inability to tie\n\nhis shoes; inability to get himself to school; inability to make purchases or count\n\nchange; a lack of interest in television or games as a child; wandering the\n\nneighborhood alone aimlessly; delayed ability to walk or talk as a child; and never\n\nlearning to ride a bicycle.\n\n\n      Tellingly, State did not call a single expert during the punishment phase to\n\nrebut Petetan’s clinical evidence of intellectual disability. Rather, it called and\n\ncross-examined a series of lay witnesses and asked them if Petetan was “mentally\n\nretarded.” None of those lay witnesses were provided with a definition of “mental\n\nretardation” or shown to be competent to render such an opinion. No objections\n\nwere voiced to the questions, their qualification to answer, or their answers.\n\n\n      On the basis of the arguments set out above, Petetan urges this Court to\n\nreject the intellectual disability approach of Briseno and adopt the clinical\n\nstandards approach of intellectual disability as embraced by the Supreme Court in\n\nAtkins and Hall. Under a clinical standards approach as advocated, Petetan would\n\nunquestionable prevail on this point of error.\n\n\n      Even if the Court is not willing to reconsider the Briseno approach, Petetan\n\nnevertheless argues he should prevail on this claim. Viewing the entirety of the\n\nevidence relative to intellectual disability in a neutral light, the jury’s rejection of\n\n                                         - 146 -\n\fthe special issue is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and\n\nmanifestly unjust. The Court should reform the sentence to a life sentence.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Eleven\n\n\nPetetan’s intellectual disability renders him ineligible for the death penalty.\n\n\n      As demonstrated in the preceding point of error, Petetan proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence at trial that he is intellectually disabled. The jury‘s\n\nrejection of his assertion of intellectual disability is against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n      In Atkins v. Virginia, decided in 2002, the United States Supreme Court\n\ndiscerned a national consensus against the execution of “mentally retarded”\n\noffenders and declared that such offenders are categorically immune from the\n\ndeath penalty. 536 U.S. 304 (2002). Hall v. Florida further addressed not simply\n\nhow to interpret IQ scores, but rather “how intellectual disability must be defined\n\nin order to implement … the holding of Atkins.” 134 S. Ct. at 1993. The record\n\nshows Petetan is intellectually disabled either under the flawed Briseno approach\n\nor a clinical standards approach as approved by the Supreme Court in Atkins and\n\nHall. Accordingly, Petetan is not eligible for the death penalty under the Eighth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Court should\n\nreform his death sentence to a life sentence.\n                                        - 147 -\n\f                                Point of Error Twelve\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “militate” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\n        Petetan objected to the trial court’s failure to define the term “militate”\n\nwithin the punishment charge. He proposed a definition which would prevent the\n\njury from return a sentence of death for unconstitutional reasons. The request was\n\ndenied by the trial court. Petetan maintains the denial of his objection was error\n\nresulting in a due process violation under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution and not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Petetan\n\nacknowledges there is authority against this point of error. See Martinez v. State,\n\n924 S.W.2d 693, 698 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996) (rejecting similar claim). The point\n\nof error is presented to avoid waiving the claim on appeal and for exhaustion of the\n\nclaim before this Court.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Thirteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection to the instruction that\n\n10 votes were required for the jury to return a “no” answer to the first special\n\nissue concerning future dangerousness (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR\n\n212).\n                                         - 148 -\n\f      Petetan objected to the trial court’s instruction that 10 votes were required\n\nfrom the jurors to return a “no” answer to the first special issue. The number is\n\nartificial and hides the fact a single “no” answer will result in a sentence of life\n\nrather than death. The objection was denied by the trial court. Petetan maintains\n\nthe denial of his objection was error resulting in a due process violation under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and not harmless beyond\n\na reasonable doubt. Petetan acknowledges there is authority against this point of\n\nerror. See Brown v. State, 554 S.W.2d 677, 678 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977) (rejecting\n\nsimilar claim).

The\n\nobjection was denied by the trial court. Petetan maintains the denial of his\n\nobjection was error resulting in a due process violation under the Fourteenth\n\n                                        - 149 -\n\fAmendment to the United States Constitution and not harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.

The\n\ninstructions would have charged the jury thusly: (1) “That its consideration of\n\nvictim impact evidence should not be conducted in connection with the future\n\ndangerousness issue”; (2) “That its consideration of victim impact evidence did not\n\nrelieve the state of its burden to prove the ‘future dangerousness' special issue\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt”; (3) “To disregard victim impact evidence that was not\n\nshown to be within the knowledge or reasonable expectation of the defendant”; (4)\n\n“Not to make a comparative worth analysis of the value of the victims to their\n\nfamilies and community compared to the defendant or other members of society.”\n\nAll of the requested instructions were denied by the trial court.

In support of the claim, Petetan relies on Justice Breyer’s recent\n\ndissenting opinion in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. ___, ___ (2015); 2015 WL\n\n2473454. at *27 (2015). There, it was recognized it is highly likely the death\n\npenalty violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual\n\npunishment. Specifically, Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg, observed\n\nthat today’s administration of the death penalty involves three fundamental\n\nconstitutional defects: (1) serious unreliability; (2) arbitrariness in application; (3)\n\nunconscionably long delays that undermine the death penalty’s penological\n\npurpose; and perhaps as a result of those defects, most places within the United\n\nStates have abandoned its use. Id.\n\n\n      Petetan acknowledges there is authority against this point of error. See\n\nGregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 187 (1976); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 247\n\n(1976); and Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 268 (1976). The point of error is\n\n                                         - 159 -\n\fpresented to avoid waiving the claim on appeal and for exhaustion of the claim\n\nbefore this Court.\n\n\n                             Point of Error Twenty-Seven\n\n\nPetetan was denied equal protection of the law due to the absence of a unified\n\nstatutory procedure for pretrial litigation of an Atkins assertion of intellectual\n\ndisability (18 RR 12, 4 CR 1228).\n\n\n      Petetan filed a motion for a pretrial Atkins determination (4 CR 1228). The\n\ntrial court considered the request by Petetan for a pretrial determination by the\n\ncourt of whether Petetan suffers from intellectual disability (18 RR 4). Counsel\n\nnoted the absence of legislation in Texas addressing the issue and conflicting case\n\nlaw on the subject in Texas (18 RR 5). As noted in the motion, most states which\n\nhave enacted legislation in response to Atkins allow for a pretrial determination of\n\nintellectual disability (18 RR 5, 4 CR 1228). Noting the procedural difficulty of\n\nthe request, the lack of a clear statute, and that he could go either way, the trial\n\ncourt denied Petetan’s request for a pretrial intellectual disability determination by\n\nthe court (18 RR 7-8, 12).\n\n\n      This Court recently considered a complaint by the State regarding a trial\n\ncourt’s intent to determine an Atkins assertion pretrial in a hearing before the trial\n\ncourt. See In re Allen, 462 S.W.3d 47 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015). Finding no clear\n                                         - 160 -\n\fviolation of a ministerial duty in conducting such a proceeding, mandamus relief\n\nwas denied to the State. Id. at 51.\n\n\n      Lamenting the absence of a statutory scheme addressing the procedure\n\nchallenged in Allen, the Court noted:\n\n\n      While we withhold normative judgment, the need for a statutory\n      scheme on this score is readily apparent, and its continued absence\n      portends serious consequences for our criminal-justice system.\n      Without a unified procedure, intellectual-disability\n      determinations may vary from county to county, court to court,\n      and case to case. As the present cases and authorities cited in this\n      opinion illustrate, some judges may prefer to address the issues\n      pretrial, others by submission of a special issue to the jury. The\n      gravity of defendants' intellectual-disability claims are too\n      weighty to be subject to such disparity. . . . We now make explicit\n      what we before expressed only tacitly: Legislation is required. Id. at\n      54. (Emphasis added).\n\n\n      The disparity recognized by a majority of this Court in Allen is the basis for\n\nPetetan’s assertion of a denial of equal protection of the law. He should not have\n\nbeen denied a pretrial Atkins determination by the trial court simply because his\n\ncase was prosecuted in McLennan County rather than Dallas County. There is a no\n\nrational relationship between the disparity of treatment between equally situated\n\ndefendants asserting a pretrial intellectual disability claims and some legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose. The disparity in treatment denied Petetan equal treatment\n\nunder the law and due process of law. The conviction should be reversed and\n\n\n                                        - 161 -\n\fremanded to the trial court for a pretrial intellectual disability determination before\n\nthe court.\n\n\n                           Point of Error Twenty-Eight\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect Petetan was convicted of\n\na capital felony offense rather than a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\n\n      This point of error seeks modification of Petetan’s judgment because it\n\nerroneously states he was convicted of a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\nPetetan was convicted of a capital felony and punishment was assessed at death.\n\nSee TEX. PEN. CODE §§ 12.04(a)(1), 12.31(a), and 19.03(a)(2). He was not\n\nconvicted of a first degree felony as recited in the judgment.\n\n\n      Even if a defendant is not being harmed by a deficiency in a judgment, he\n\nnevertheless has an interest in having the judgment correctly reflect the findings of\n\nthe trial court and the jury. Howell v. State, 563 S.W.2d 933, 936 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1978). A judgment should properly recite the degree of the offense for which the\n\ndefendant was convicted. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 42.01 § 14.\n\n\n      The general rule is that if an appellate court has the necessary data and\n\nevidence before it, the judgment may be modified or reformed on appeal. Splawn\n\nv. State, 160 S.W.3d 103, 107 (Tex. App. - Texarkana 2005, pet. ref’d). This Court\n\n\n                                        - 162 -\n\fhas the authority to modify the judgment of a trial court. TEX. R. APP. P. 78.1(b).\n\nThe authority to modify a judgment includes reformation of a judgment which fails\n\nto correctly reflect the degree of the offense for which the defendant was\n\nconvicted. Land v. State, 291 S.W.3d 23, 31 (Tex. App. – Texarkana 2009, pet.\n\nref’d); Jackson v. State, 288 S.W.3d 60, 64 (Tex. App. – Houston [1st Dist.] 2009,\n\npet. ref’d).\n\n\n       The record contains the necessary data and information for modification of\n\nthe judgment. This Court should modify the judgment to properly reflect the\n\ndegree of felony for which Petetan was convicted was that of a capital felony\n\nrather than that of a first degree felony offense.\n\n\n                            Point of Error Twenty-Nine\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect punishment was assessed\n\nby the trial court rather than the jury (4 CR 1343).\n\n\n       At the conclusion of the punishment phase, the jury returned answers to the\n\nfour special issues submitted in the court’s charge (60 RR 67-68, 4 CR 1336-\n\n1339). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, punishment was assessed\n\nby the trial court at death (60 RR 71). Despite the trial court’s assessment of\n\npunishment, the judgment erroneously recites the jury assessed punishment (4 CR\n\n1343).\n                                        - 163 -\n\f      When there is a variation between the oral pronouncement of sentence and\n\nthe written memorialization of the sentence, the oral pronouncement controls.\n\nCoffey v. State, 979 S.W.2d 326, 328 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). An appellate court\n\nis authorized to reform or modify the judgment to conform to the record of the\n\nproceedings and to render an appropriate judgment, in accordance with its\n\nauthority under TEX. R. APP. P. 78.1(b). See French v. State, 830 S.W.2d 607, 609\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1992) (appellate court has authority to reform a judgment to\n\ninclude an affirmative finding to make the record speak the truth when the matter\n\nhas been called to its attention by any source); Bigley v. State, 865 S.W.2d 26, 27\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (appellate court has the power to modify incorrect\n\njudgments when the necessary data and information are available to do so).\n\n\n      Petetan suggests it is appropriate to modify the trial court's judgment to\n\nreflect that the trial court, and not the jury, assessed the sentence in this case, in\n\naccordance with the trial court's oral pronouncement at trial and the provisions of\n\nTEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 37.071§ 2(g) (providing for court sentencing based\n\non the jury’s responses to the special issues submitted within the court’s charge).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 164 -\n\f                                      Prayer\n\n      Appellant prays this Court will reverse the judgment of conviction and\n\nreform to an acquittal, remand for a new trial, remand for a new punishment\n\nhearing, reform the sentence to a life sentence, remand for a new competency\n\nhearing, modify the judgment, or enter any other relief appropriate under the law\n\nand the facts.\n\n\n                                                   Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                   /s/Richard E.

The facts are voluminous and the issues on appeal\n\nare complex. It is respectfully suggested argument would assist the Court in its\n\ndecisional process.\n\n\n                               Statement of the Case\n\n\n      This is an appeal from a criminal proceeding. Petetan was indicted by a\n\nMcLennan County grand jury for the offense of capital murder (1 CR 44). It was\n\nalleged Petetan murdered his wife, Kimberly Petetan, by shooting her with a\n\nfirearm while he was in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\n\noffenses of burglary, kidnapping, and retaliation (1 CR 44). The State gave notice\n\nof its intent to seek the death penalty (2 RR 6).\n\n\n      Petetan asserted he was incompetent to stand trial and sought a competency\n\ndetermination by a jury (2 CR 383). A competency jury was selected and sworn\n\n(10 RR 109, 110). The jury found Petetan competent to stand trial (2 CR 453, 13\n\nRR 94).\n\n\n      A jury was selected and sworn for trial on the charged offense of capital\n\nmurder (48 RR 108, 50 RR 192, and 51 RR 16). Petetan entered a plea of not\n\nguilty to the indicted offense (51 RR 26). At the conclusion of the guilt or\n\n\n                                         -1-\n\finnocence phase, the jury found Petetan guilty of capital murder as charged in the\n\nindictment (4 CR 1308, 54 RR 224).\n\n\n      Punishment was tried to the same jury (55-60 RR). At the conclusion of the\n\npunishment phase, the jury returned answers to four special issues (4 CR 1336-\n\n1339, 60 RR 67-68). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, punishment\n\nwas assessed by the trial court at death and Petetan was sentenced in open court\n\n(60 RR 71).\n\n\n      A motion for new trial was filed and denied (4 CR 1377, 1382). Appeal to\n\nthis Court is automatic. Nonetheless, the trial court certified Petetan’s right to\n\nappeal and notice of appeal was timely filed (4 CR 1348, 1353).\n\n\n                            Issues Presented on Appeal\n\n\nPoint of Error One\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege as to testimony he sought to offer from his former\n\nattorney on the issue of competency to stand trial (13 RR 57).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fPoint of Error Two\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence Petetan sought to\n\noffer concerning the legal fate of those who obtain an incompetency\n\ndetermination through malingering (13 RR 60).\n\n\nPoint of Error Three\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (28 RR\n\n89).\n\n\nPoint of Error Four\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who believed law enforcement officers to\n\nbe more credible than other witnesses (28 RR 89).\n\n\nPoint of Error Five\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Luther Fore who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (30 RR\n\n174).\n                                      -3-\n\fPoint of Error Six\n\n\nThe evidence is insufficient to prove Petetan murdered the complainant while\n\nin the course of committing or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\nPoint of Error Seven\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Miller he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Miller drugs if he would drive Petetan to\n\nWaco (53 RR 31).\n\n\nPoint of Error Eight\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Mouton he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Mouton drugs if he would accompany\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 31).\n\n\nPoint of Error Nine\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence which undermined\n\ndefense counsel before the jury and created a conflict of interest which denied\n\nPetetan his right to the effective assistance of counsel (59 RR 198).\n                                         -4-\n\fPoint of Error Ten\n\n\nThe jury’s answer to the intellectual disability special issue is against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\nPoint of Error Eleven\n\n\nPetetan’s intellectual disability renders him ineligible for the death penalty.\n\n\nPoint of Error Twelve\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “militate” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Thirteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection to the instruction that\n\n10 votes were required for the jury to return a “no” answer to the first special\n\nissue concerning future dangerousness (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR\n\n212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Fourteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection to the “anti-sympathy”\n\ninstruction insofar as the instruction would limit the scope of mitigating\n\n                                       -5-\n\fevidence and or circumstances that jury may consider in returning a life\n\nsentence (4 CR 1320, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Fifteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s request that the jury be\n\ninstructed on the concept of mercy and the role it can play in deliberations (4\n\nCR 1320, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Sixteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by submitting a special issue on future dangerousness\n\nwhich was not found by the grand jury or alleged in the indictment returned\n\nagainst Petetan (1 CR 44, 4 CR 1321, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Seventeen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “probability” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1321, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fPoint of Error Eighteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrase “criminal acts of violence”\n\nwithin the punishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1322, 4 CR 1330,\n\nand 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Nineteen\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrase “continuing threat to\n\nsociety” within the punishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1323, 4\n\nCR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to submit Petetan’s four requested instructions\n\nrelative to the jury’s consideration of victim impact evidence (4 CR 1324, 4\n\nCR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-One\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the phrases “personal moral\n\nculpability” and “moral blameworthiness” within the punishment charge as\n\nrequested by Petetan (4 CR 1325, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fPoint of Error Twenty-Two\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the charge unduly\n\nlimited what factors the jury could consider as mitigating (4 CR 1325, 4 CR\n\n1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Three\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the mitigation\n\nspecial issue is unconstitutional for failing to assign a burden of proof and not\n\nbeing susceptible to a sufficiency of the evidence review on appeal (4 CR 1326,\n\n4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Four\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the jury should be\n\ninstructed there is a presumption in favor of a life sentence rather than a\n\nsentence of death (4 CR 1327, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Five\n\n\nThe trial court erred by overruling Petetan’s objection that the jury should be\n\ninstructed that if it was unable to agree on a special issue, a mistrial would be\n\ndeclared and life sentence imposed (4 CR 1326, 4 CR 1330, and 59 RR 212).\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fPoint of Error Twenty-Six\n\n\nImposition of the death penalty violates Petetan’s Eighth Amendment and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights not to be subjected to cruel and unusual\n\npunishment.\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Seven\n\n\nPetetan was denied equal protection of the law and due course of law due to\n\nthe absence of a unified statutory procedure for pretrial litigation of an Atkins\n\nassertion of intellectual disability (18 RR 12, 4 CR 1228).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Eight\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect Petetan was convicted of\n\na capital felony offense rather than a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\n\nPoint of Error Twenty-Nine\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect punishment was assessed\n\nby the trial court rather than the jury (4 CR 1343).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f                                 Statement of Facts\n\n\n                               A. Competency Trial\n\n\n       Petetan filed a motion, supported by the affidavit of an expert, alleging he\n\nwas incompetent to stand trial (2 CR 383). He sought a jury determination of his\n\ncompetency to be tried (2 CR 383). The trial court appointed an independent\n\nexpert to examine Petetan’s competency to stand trial (2 CR 392). That expert\n\nopined Petetan was competent for trial (2 CR 414). In view of the conflicting\n\nopinions regarding Petetan’s competency, the trial court agreed a jury trial on\n\ncompetency was warranted (8 RR 5). A jury to pass on the issue of competency\n\nwas selected and sworn (10 RR 109, 110).\n\n\n       Dr. Ollie Seay is a psychologist from Austin (12 RR 32). She was employed\n\nby the defense to examine Petetan relative to his competency to stand trial (12 RR\n\n49).\n\n\n       She explained that in current practice the term intellectual disability is used\n\nrather than the outdated term mental retardation (12 RR 43). She agreed both\n\nterms have the same definition and three prongs to determine existence (12 RR\n\n43). Intellectual disability alone will not render an individual incompetent for trial\n\n(12 RR 48).\n\n\n\n                                         - 10 -\n\f       She met with Petetan on three occasions and administered various\n\nassessment tests (12 RR 51). She reviewed police reports, medical reports, school\n\nrecords, and other psychological records (12 RR 53). Even though she did not\n\nadminister an IQ test, previous IQ testing provided to her raised some concerns for\n\nher and those concerns were confirmed by her testing of and interaction with\n\nPetetan (12 RR 63, 99). Various test results from IQ tests administered to Petetan\n\nfrom childhood to 2012 were consistent in their results (12 RR 165).\n\n\n       She administered a test designed to determine competency for those with\n\nintellectual disability (12 RR 67). Petetan scored 63% of the answers on the test\n\ncorrectly (12 RR 69). The score placed him within the range of those found\n\nincompetent to stand trial and below those found competent to stand trial (12 RR\n\n70).\n\n\n       Based on her examination, Petetan has limited capacity to understand the\n\ncriminal charges against him (12 RR 71). He does not have the ability to consult\n\nwith counsel (12 RR 73). She felt he would not be capable to testify because he\n\nbecomes stuck on one topic or loses attention quickly (12 RR 83). Based on all of\n\nher activity in the case, Seay did not believe Petetan was competent to stand trial\n\nbecause his intellectual disability was interfering with his ability to be competent\n\n(12 RR 88-89). She did not believe he was subject to having his competency\n\n\n                                        - 11 -\n\frestored due to his intellectual disability (12 RR 88, 148). Petetan rested (12 RR\n\n171).\n\n\n        Dr. Michael Pittman is a psychiatrist from Dallas (12 RR 172). He was\n\nappointed by the trial court to examine Petetan for competency (12 RR 174). He\n\nassessed Petetan in jail and reviewed various documents (12 RR 177). He did not\n\nadminister a written examination to Petetan (12 RR 199).\n\n\n        Pittman did not believe Petetan to be intellectually disabled, but did believe\n\nhis intellect was below average and that he was a “little low in the IQ department”\n\n(12 RR 185). After his assessment, Pittman believed Petetan competent for trial\n\n(12 RR 186, 196).\n\n\n        On September 23, 2012, Christopher Moutray, of the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment, interviewed Petetan with regard to the murder of his wife, Kimberly\n\nPetetan (12 RR 207). Petetan was given his Miranda warnings, which he appeared\n\nto understand (12 RR 211, 212). Petetan spoke with Moutray and another\n\ndetective about the events which had transpired the day of his wife’s death (12 RR\n\n215). During the interview, Petetan repeatedly told the detectives that Adrian\n\nMiller had killed Kimberly (12 RR 217). Petetan participated in a gunshot residue\n\ntest, but refused to provide a DNA sample (12 RR 220, 223). Upon his arrest,\n\nPetetan invoked his right to counsel (12 RR 226). The recorded interview of\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fPetetan in Bryan was played for the jury (12 RR 228, 61 RR SX C). The State\n\nrested (13 RR 15).\n\n\n      Seay was recalled by the defense (13 RR 16). She said that she believed\n\nPetetan was being honest with her during their three interviews (13 RR 22). After\n\nlistening to the State’s evidence, she still believed Petetan incompetent for trial (13\n\nRR 25).\n\n\n      Both sides closed on the issue of competency (13 RR 61). No objection was\n\nvoiced to the court’s charge (13 RR 12). The charge was read to the jury (13 RR\n\n62). Argument was presented (13 RR 70, 75, and 84). The jury returned a verdict\n\nfinding Petetan competent to stand trial (13 RR 94).\n\n\n                            B. Guilt or Innocence Phase\n\n\n      The indictment alleges Petetan killed Kimberly Petetan on September 23,\n\n2012, by shooting her with a firearm while in the course of committing burglary of\n\nKimberly Petetan, retaliation of Kimberly Petetan, and kidnapping of Kimberly\n\nPetetan and her daughter, A. W.1 (1 CR 44, 51 RR 25).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, at 6:30 pm in the evening, Waco Police Officer\n\nRebecca Diaz responded to a report of shots fired at The Landing apartment\n\n1\n  “A. W.” was a minor at the time of the offense and a pseudonym is used\nthroughout this brief. See TEX. R. APP. P. 9.10(a)(3).\n                                       - 13 -\n\fcomplex in Waco (51 RR 47). She and a fellow officer approached an apartment,\n\nknocked on the door, and opened the door when no one answered (51 RR 54).\n\nThey saw the body of a white female on the floor as well as bloodstains near the\n\nbody (51 RR 56). The victim had suffered multiple gunshot wounds (51 RR 56).\n\n\n      Diaz and her fellow officer searched for other victims or a suspect in the\n\napartment and found none (51 RR 57). There were no signs of forced entry into\n\nthe apartment (51 RR 58). The gunshot victim died by the time paramedics arrived\n\n(51 RR 64).\n\n\n      After speaking with a neighbor, Diaz learned the identity of the gunshot\n\nvictim as Kimberly Petetan (51 RR 66). Diaz also learned that the victim had a\n\nyoung daughter and Diaz was concerned because the child was not in the\n\napartment and her whereabouts were unknown (51 RR 67). While still at the\n\nscene, Diaz learned the child had been located in Bryan (51 RR 67).\n\n\n      Ashley Roy, an evidence technician with the Waco Police Department, went\n\nto the scene of shooting (51 RR 117). She saw a body with gunshot wounds (51\n\nRR 120). Roy found three .380 shell casings at the scene (51 RR 120-123). Inside\n\nthe apartment, she noticed blood stains on the four lowest stairs near the front door\n\n(51 RR 123). The bloodstains led her to believe the person was already wounded\n\nwhen they climbed the four stairs (51 RR 133). She found no bloodstains upstairs\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f(51 RR 139). There was no sign of a forced entry or struggle in the apartment (51\n\nRR 124-125). She recovered two cigarette butts and a cigar package outside the\n\napartment (51 RR 153).\n\n\n      Joyce Marek, a Waco Police Department crime scene technician, searched\n\nPetetan’s 1989 Suburban vehicle which had been seized by the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment (51 RR 164). She took photos of the vehicle and found what she\n\nthought to be bloodstains in the vehicle (51 RR 167). The vehicle contained\n\nnumerous papers belonging to Petetan (51 RR 178). She also found maps in the\n\nvehicle showing directions from Port Arthur to Waco and to McLennan County\n\nCommunity College (51 RR 188).\n\n\n      Drs. Chester Gwin and Allison Edgecombe, of the Southwestern Institute of\n\nForensic Sciences, performed an autopsy on the body of Kimberly Petetan (51 RR\n\n200-203). During the examination, they found evidence of two gunshot wounds\n\n(51 RR 206). The projectile from one of the wounds hit several major organs (51\n\nRR 220). Gwin testified that Kimberly Petetan died from multiple gunshot wounds\n\n(51 RR 224).\n\n\n      Lanelle Waley is a firearm and tool mark examiner with the Department of\n\nPublic Safety in Austin (51 RR 229). He examined the three shell casings found in\n\napartment and determined they were .380 Winchester cartridges (51 RR 235). All\n\n                                      - 15 -\n\fof the casings had been fired from the same firearm which may have been a Bersa\n\nThunder Model .380 (51 RR 237-238). Waley explained that the Department will\n\nnot conduct a gunshot residue tests if the suspects hands were swabbed more than\n\nfour hours after a weapon was allegedly fired (51 RR 242).\n\n\n       Erin Casmus is a forensic scientist with the Department of Public Safety in\n\nWaco (51 RR 246). He examined evidence submitted in the case (51 RR 249). A\n\ncigarette butt at the scene of the shooting had DNA consistent with that of Kerrie\n\nMouton (51 RR 253). A bloodstain found on the shirt Petetan was wearing at the\n\ntime of his arrest contained DNA consistent with Petetan’s own DNA (51 RR 261).\n\n\n       Kristin Warmack is the older sister of A. W.2 and daughter of Kimberly\n\nPetetan (52 RR 7). She and her mother met Petetan’s brother at a brake repair shop\n\nin Waxahachie and he suggested Kimberly write to Petetan to share her story and\n\nGod’s love (52 RR 17-19). Her mother corresponded with Petetan in 2009 and\n\n2010 and eventually began to have romantic feelings toward him (52 RR 20).\n\nThey were married by proxy in September of 2010 with Warmack standing in for\n\nPetetan (52 RR 23). Petetan came to live with Kimberly and A. W. in April of\n\n2012 (52 RR 26).\n\n\n\n\n2\n    Warmack and “A. W.” do not have the same last name.\n                                     - 16 -\n\f      In August of 2012, Kimberly was planning to move to Port Arthur to be with\n\nPetetan (52 RR 28). She then decided to stay in Waco and rented an apartment at\n\nThe Landing apartment complex (52 RR 33). Kimberly eventually moved to Port\n\nArthur in early September of 2012 to be with Petetan (52 RR 34).\n\n\n      On September 13, 2012, Warmack received a voice message from A. W.\n\ninforming her that Petetan was threatening their mother with a knife (52 RR 36).\n\nThe following day, her mother decided to leave Port Arthur and move back to\n\nWaco (52 RR 37). Her mother told her that in view of Petetan’s assault in front of\n\nA. W., she was leaving Petetan and intended to divorce him (52 RR 38).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, A. W. called Warmack from a convenience store in\n\nConroe and asked her to come pick her up (52 RR 42). On the way, Warmack\n\nreceived a call from her mother’s apartment manager in Waco informing her that\n\nher mother had been shot and was dead (52 RR 43). Warmack called 911 to report\n\nher sister’s call for help and upon investigation by the police; she was told A. W.\n\nwas not at the convenience store (52 RR 44).\n\n\n      Later in the day on September 23, 2012, Warmack received a telephone call\n\nfrom Kerrie Mouton informing her that the police in Bryan had A. W. (52 RR 45).\n\nShe drove to Bryan that night and picked up her younger sister, A. W. (52 RR 46).\n\nA. W. now lives with her (52 RR 7).\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\f       Warmack went to her mother’s apartment in Waco a couple of days later to\n\npick up some clothing for A. W. (52 RR 48). While at the apartment, she found\n\nher mother’s purse in the dishwasher (52 RR 49).\n\n\n       On September 13, 2012, Ryan Kidwell, of the Port Arthur Police\n\nDepartment, responded to a domestic disturbance call (52 RR 83). Kimberly\n\nPetetan told Kidwell that Petetan assaulted her when she asked him to stop\n\nsmoking in the apartment because her daughter has asthma (52 RR 85). She said\n\nPetetan had thrown her to the floor and held a kitchen knife close to her (52 RR\n\n86). While holding the knife close to her, Petetan said “I could kill you, do you\n\nwant to die in front of your child?” (52 RR 88).\n\n\n       Petetan left the apartment by the time Kidwell arrived (52 RR 87).\n\nKimberly told the officer she wanted to file assault charges against Petetan and she\n\nknew it would be a felony since he used a knife during the assault (52 RR 90). She\n\nalso told the officer she was leaving Port Arthur and moving back to Waco (52 RR\n\n93).\n\n\n       On September 23, 2012, Jackie Musgrove was staying at a motel in Waco\n\n(52 RR 102). Petetan approached him and asked him to rent a room in Musgrove’s\n\nname for Petetan in return for ten dollars (52 RR 104). Musgrove did as asked and\n\nwas paid by Petetan (52 RR 108).\n\n                                       - 18 -\n\f      On September 23, 2012, Cornelius Jefferson was at The Landing apartment\n\ncomplex in Waco washing clothes (52 RR 121). He was approached by a man\n\nwho asked him to knock on an apartment door (52 RR 124). Jefferson agreed to do\n\nso because he thought it was a joke or prank (52 RR 124). He knocked on the door\n\nand two women looked out the window (52 RR 125). The man who asked him to\n\nknock was crouched down behind Jefferson (52 RR 126). Eventually one of the\n\nwomen opened the door of the apartment and the man who had been crouched\n\ndown behind Jefferson ran into the apartment (52 RR 127). Jefferson identified\n\nPetetan as the man who asked him to knock on the door and eventually ran into the\n\napartment (52 RR 132).\n\n\n      Nichlos Lampkin previously lived in the same apartment complex as\n\nKimberly and A. W. on Purvis Street in Waco (52 RR 147). Petetan later moved\n\ninto the apartment and frequently argued with Kimberly (52 RR 153). Sometimes\n\nwhen Petetan was angry, he would tell Lampkin in reference to Kimerbly “man,\n\nI’m going to kill that bitch” (52 RR 154). Petetan and Kimberly eventually moved\n\nfrom the complex (52 RR 158).\n\n\n      Morris Evans knew Petetan and Kimberly when they lived in an apartment\n\ncomplex on Purvis Street in Waco (52 RR 165). Evans recalled an occasion when\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 19 -\n\fPetetan accused him of sleeping with Kimberly (52 RR 168). Evans remembered\n\nPetetan saying “I’m going to kill the bitch” (52 RR 169).\n\n\n      Charles Gatlin was an inmate at the McLennan County Jail with Petetan\n\nfollowing Petetan’s arrest for murder (52 RR 179). One morning in jail, Petetan\n\nbumped into Gatlin and Gatlin said “excuse me” to which Petetan replied “I killed\n\nmy wife and I will kill you” (52 RR 179). On another occasion, Petetan asked\n\nGatlin if the authorities could match a fingerprint from a gun based on a DNA\n\nsample (52 RR 181). Petetan asked Gatlin to explain a ballistics report and\n\nwhether it meant the police had a gun (52 RR 182).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, Officer Crystal O’Rear, of the Bryan Police\n\nDepartment, received a call of a possible kidnapping (53 RR 7). Within ten\n\nminutes she saw a vehicle matching the description of that involved in the possible\n\nkidnapping (53 RR 21). She stopped the vehicle which was occupied by four\n\npeople, Petetan, A. W., Adrian Miller, and Kerrie Mouton (53 RR 8, 11). Backup\n\nofficers arrived, the occupants were separated, and O’Rear had an opportunity to\n\nspeak with A. W. about what had happened to her mother in Waco (53 RR 13, 15).\n\nWhile stopped on the roadway, Mouton called A. W.’s older sister in Conroe and\n\ntold her A. W. was in Bryan and safe in the presence of law enforcement officers\n\n(53 RR 25).\n\n\n                                       - 20 -\n\f       At 9:43 pm on September 23, 2012, Officer Lance Matthews, of the Bryan\n\nPolice Department, received a call that his assistance was needed in conducting\n\nsome interviews (51 RR 72). Those to be interviewed had knowledge of a murder\n\nin Waco (51 RR 73). They had been stopped in a vehicle traveling through Bryan\n\n(51 RR 73). The individuals to be interviewed were A. W., Kerrie Mouton, Adrian\n\nMiller, and Petetan (51 RR 76). Matthews first obtained some information from a\n\nWaco Police Department detective before conducting the interviews (51 RR 77).\n\n\n       Matthews first interviewed A. W., the daughter of Kimberly Petetan (51 RR\n\n79). She had no difficulty describing the events leading to her mother’s shooting\n\n(51 RR 81).\n\n\n       Matthew next spoke with Miller (51 RR 82). Miller was cooperative,\n\nprovided a DNA sample, and took a gunshot residue test (51 RR 84, 86). After the\n\ninterview, Matthews did not believe Miller was involved in the shooting (51 RR\n\n87).\n\n\n       Mouton was interviewed next (51 RR 87). He was cooperative, provided a\n\nDNA sample, and took a gunshot residue test (51 RR 88). After interviewing\n\nMouton, Matthews did not believe him to be a suspect in the shooting (51 RR 90).\n\n\n       Petetan was the last person interviewed (51 RR 91). He was cooperative and\n\ntook a gunshot residue test (51 RR 92). He refused to provide a DNA sample (51\n                                       - 21 -\n\fRR 92). At the conclusion of the interviews, Matthews arrested Petetan for the\n\nmurder of Kimberly Petetan based on a McLennan County arrest warrant (51 RR\n\n92). Miller and Mouton were released and A. W. was turned over to her older\n\nsister (51 RR 93, 95).\n\n\n      Adrian Miller and Petetan grew up together in Port Arthur (53 RR 34). In\n\nthe early morning of September 23, 2012, Miller saw Petetan at a store in Port\n\nArthur (53 RR 36). Petetan told him he was going to Waco to buy some drugs and\n\nhe would give Miller an ounce of crack cocaine and some money if he would drive\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 37). Kerrie Mouton agreed to come along in order to\n\n“watch Miller’s back” (53 RR 40).\n\n\n      On the way to Waco, Petetan had a gun which he placed in the hood\n\ncompartment of his Suburban (53 RR 41). The threesome arrived in Waco about\n\nnoon and went to a motel (53 RR 43). Petetan paid a man to rent a room for them\n\n(53 RR 45).\n\n\n      Petetan left the motel in his Suburban without Miller or Mouton (53 RR 52).\n\nWhen Petetan returned to the motel, he was driving Kimberly’s truck which was\n\nalso occupied by Kimberly and A. W. (53 RR 52). Petetan told Miller and Mouton\n\nto get in the bed of the truck and they all drove to Kimberly’s apartment complex\n\n(53 RR 54). Miller noticed Petetan’s vehicle was at the complex (53 RR 55).\n\n                                      - 22 -\n\f      They entered Kimberly’s apartment (53 RR 56). Miller and Mouton stayed\n\ndownstairs and watched television for two hours (53 RR 56). Petetan and\n\nKimberly went upstairs and Miller never heard them arguing (53 RR 56). When\n\nPetetan and Kimberly came downstairs, Kimberly told Miller where he could find\n\nsomething to eat in the kitchen (53 RR 57).\n\n\n      As Kimberly was trying to walk out the front door, Petetan slammed the\n\ndoor shut and struck her with his fist (53 RR 57). Petetan then produced a pistol\n\nand shot Kimberly multiple times (53 RR 59). Miller testified that Mouton ran out\n\nof the apartment after the first shot and A. W. did so after the second shot (53 RR\n\n59). Miller believed Petetan shot Kimberly four times and he saw her fall to the\n\nfloor in the apartment (53 RR 60).\n\n\n      Miller and Petetan left the apartment and got in Petetan’s vehicle which was\n\nalready occupied in the back seat by Mouton and A. W. (53 RR 61). Miller\n\ntestified he got in the vehicle to drive because he was concerned Petetan would\n\nhurt A. W. or Mouton (53 RR 62). Miller stated that no one told A. W. and\n\nMouton to get in Petetan’s Suburban, they simply did so after the shooting of\n\nKimberly in the apartment (53 RR 90).\n\n\n      With Miller driving, they stopped for gas (53 RR 63). Petetan gave Miller\n\nmoney to purchase gasoline after Petetan had rubbed the money on his hands (53\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\fRR 63). Petetan followed Miller into the gas station and Miller was not able to\n\nalert the clerk of the shooting in Waco (53 RR 65).\n\n\n      In the vehicle, A. W. asked if her mother was dead (53 RR 68). Miller told\n\nher “no,” and Petetan said nothing (53 RR 68). Miller never heard Petetan\n\napologize to A. W. for killing her mother (53 RR 68).\n\n\n      After stopping at a store in Bryan, Miller intentionally engaged in aggressive\n\ndriving in an effort to attract the attention of a nearby police officer (53 RR 70,\n\n72). When the officer approached the vehicle, Miller told the officer that he\n\nneeded to talk to the officer in private (53 RR 72). Petetan told Miller to only talk\n\nto the officer in the presence of Petetan (53 RR 72).\n\n\n      When the officer took Miller to the rear of the vehicle, Miller told him what\n\nhad happed in Waco (53 RR 73). Miller denied killing Kimberly or knowing of\n\nPetetan’s intent to do so (53 RR 77).\n\n\n      In hindsight, Miller believes Petetan was trying to set him up or frame him\n\nfor the murder of Kimberly (53 RR 74). He recalled that once they were on\n\nHighway 6 headed toward Bryan from Waco, Petetan had Miller pull over so he\n\ncould dispose of the pistol and piece of pizza Miller had taken from Kimberly’s\n\napartment (53 RR 66). Miller believed Petetan was trying to set him up with DNA\n\nfrom the pizza, or the pizza wrapper at the murder scene, and connect him to the\n                                         - 24 -\n\fmurder weapon (53 RR 66). Miller also recalled that a couple of weeks before\n\nshooting, Petetan offered him a rock of crack cocaine if he would call Kimberly\n\nand cuss her out on the phone (53 RR 91). Miller agreed to do so and he believes\n\nthe call was recorded for possible later use by Petetan in implicating him the\n\nmurder of Kimberly (53 RR 91).\n\n\n        Kerrie Mouton first met Petetan in 2012 in Port Arthur (53 RR 98). Petetan\n\nasked Mouton to come with him on trip to Waco to buy drugs (53 RR 101).\n\nPetetan promised to give Mouton some drugs if he would come along on the trip\n\n(53 RR 101).\n\n\n        Miller came with them on the trip to Waco (53 RR 102). When they arrived\n\nin Waco, they checked into a motel (53 RR 106). Petetan left the motel in his\n\nvehicle and later returned in a truck occupied by Kimberly and A. W. (53 RR 108,\n\n109).\n\n\n        Mouton and Miller got in the bed of Kimberly’s truck and she drove the five\n\nof them to her apartment (53 RR 110). Upon arriving, Kimberly opened the door\n\nand they all entered (53 RR 111, 131). While he and Miller were downstairs,\n\nMouton heard Kimberly upstairs say “fuck you Carnell, if you are going to kill me,\n\nkill me” (53 RR 113).\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\f      When Kimberly and Petetan came downstairs, she tried to unlock and open\n\nthe front door, but Petetan pushed her away and into a wall (53 RR 117). When\n\nKimberly pushed Petetan, he shot her multiple times with a handgun (53 RR 118).\n\n\n      After the shooting, Mouton and A. W. ran out the back door of the apartment\n\nand jumped into Petetan’s vehicle (53 RR 121). Mouton intended to drive the two\n\nof them away, but Miller and Petetan came outside and entered the vehicle before\n\nhe could do so (53 RR 121). Mouton did not force A. W. to get in the vehicle with\n\nhim; she simply followed him to the vehicle after the shooting of her mother (53\n\nRR 135).\n\n\n      The four of them drove away with Miller driving, Petetan in the front\n\npassenger seat, and Mouton and A. W. in the rear seat (53 RR 122). While they\n\nwere traveling, Mouton was in fear for his life and A. W. was crying and asking for\n\nher older sister (53 RR 124). Eventually, they were stopped by the police in Bryan\n\nand Mouton told the police the details of the shooting in Waco (53 RR 125, 127).\n\n\n      A. W. was eleven years old at the time of trial in April of 2014 (53 RR 143).\n\nAt one time, she and her mother lived in an apartment on Purvis Street in Waco (53\n\nRR 145). While living on Purvis, Petetan moved in with them (53 RR 145).\n\nPetetan would yell at her mother and say bad things to her (53 RR 147). She and\n\nher mother then moved to The Landing apartment complex in Waco (53 RR 148).\n\n                                      - 26 -\n\fAfter moving to The Landing, her mother told her that they were moving to Port\n\nArthur to be with Petetan because that was where he was on parole (53 RR 150).\n\n\n      After moving to Port Arthur, her mother and Petetan fought and her mother\n\nwould cry (53 RR 151). She recalled an argument in the apartment one night when\n\nPetetan refused her mother’s request to smoke outside rather than in the apartment\n\nbecause she has asthma (53 RR 155). Petetan pushed her mother to the floor and\n\nshe was crying (53 RR 156). Petetan retrieved a knife from the kitchen, put the\n\nknife behind her mother, and asked “if she wanted to die in front of A. W.” (53 RR\n\n158). Her mother ran to the bathroom and called the authorities concerning the\n\nassault and Petetan then cut himself on the stomach with the knife (53 RR 160).\n\nShe saw Petetan call the police and then leave the apartment before the police\n\narrived (53 RR 161). The next day, her mother told her they were leaving Port\n\nArthur and moving back to Waco (53 RR 163).\n\n\n      Her mother died on a Sunday after they had attended church and talked\n\nabout Heaven (53 RR 168). They were at home and heard a knock on the door (53\n\nRR 172). Looking out the window, they could tell it was a stranger knocking (53\n\nRR 173). When her mother opened the door, Petetan pushed his way into the\n\napartment without her mother inviting him in (53 RR 174). Petetan pulled a gun\n\nfrom his pocket and waved the gun around the apartment (53 RR 175). Petetan\n\n\n                                       - 27 -\n\ftold her mother to get dressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). Petetan told her\n\nmother they were going to Port Arthur and she was “going to tell the cops what\n\nhappened” (53 RR 177).\n\n\n      The three of them got into her mother’s truck and her mother was driving\n\n(53 RR 177). Petetan still had the gun in his pocket while in the truck (53 RR\n\n178). Petetan directed her mother to drive to a motel in Waco (53 RR 179). Once\n\nthey arrived at the motel, Petetan told her mother to honk the horn of the truck (53\n\nRR 180). Two men came out of a room and got in the bed of the truck (53 RR\n\n180). She did not know the men (53 RR 180).\n\n\n      They left the motel and returned to her mother’s apartment (53 RR 183).\n\nOnce at the apartment, everyone went inside (53 RR 184). The two men stayed\n\ndownstairs and her mother and Petetan went upstairs (53 RR 184). While upstairs,\n\nshe saw Petetan try to kiss her mother (53 RR 185). Petetan told A. W. to go to her\n\nown bedroom and leave them alone (53 RR 186).\n\n\n      Everyone went downstairs and her mother was washing dishes (53 RR 187).\n\nThe men were outside on a patio smoking cigarettes (53 RR 187). When they\n\ncame back into to the apartment, one of the men put a pizza in the microwave oven\n\n(53 RR 188).\n\n\n\n                                       - 28 -\n\f      When her mother tried to open the front door, Petetan ran toward the door,\n\nshut it, and pushed her mother into a wall (53 RR 190). Petetan told her mother to\n\nstand on the stairs, that it was “time for her dust away,” and then he shot her three\n\ntimes (53 RR 191). Her mother fell to the floor and “flopped around like a fish”\n\n(53 RR 192).\n\n\n      The younger of two other men in the apartment grabbed her and took her out\n\nthe back door of the apartment (53 RR 192). He told her that everything would be\n\nokay (53 RR 193). When they briefly went back into the apartment, she saw\n\nPetetan grabbing all of the cellphones in the apartment (53 RR 193).\n\n\n      All four of them then got in Petetan’s white Suburban and left (53 RR 195).\n\nAt one point, they stopped on the road by some trees and she saw Petetan wrap the\n\ngun used to shoot her mother in a sheet and then throw the sheet over a fence and\n\ninto the woods (53 RR 198). After the Suburban was stopped by the police in\n\nBryan, she told the police what had happened in Waco and her older sister then\n\npicked her up in Bryan and took her to Conroe (53 RR 201). The State rested (53\n\nRR 224).\n\n\n      On September 23, 2012, Chasity Hamilton was working as a clerk at the Big\n\nGas Truck Stop in Bryan (54 RR 15). Petetan came into the store and was acting\n\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fin a nervous manner (54 RR 18). She obtained a description of his vehicle as well\n\nas the license plate number and called the police after he left the store (54 RR 19).\n\n\n      Ricki Elliot met Petetan when he was living with Kimberly in an apartment\n\non Purvis Street him Waco (54 RR 22). Her apartment was next door and she\n\nnever heard Petetan and Kimberly arguing in their apartment (54 RR 23).\n\n\n      Petetan testified his relationship started with Kimberly while he was a\n\nprisoner serving a 20 year sentence at the Ellis Unit of the TDCJ-ID (54 RR 31).\n\nThey corresponded with one another and she would visit him in prison with her\n\ndaughter, A. W. (54 RR 35). They eventually decided to marry and were married\n\nby proxy 18 months before he was paroled from prison (54 RR 37-38).\n\n\n      He was in prison for five convictions, three aggravated assaults and two\n\nattempted murders (54 RR 84). He served 19 years and 8 months of a 20 year\n\nsentence before he was released on parole (54 RR 84).\n\n\n      After being released on parole, he lived with Kimberly and A. W. in an\n\napartment on Purvis Street in Waco (54 RR 40). He never threatened to kill his\n\nwife while living on Purvis Street (54 RR 43). They eventually moved to an\n\napartment at The Landing in Waco because they were having problems with the\n\nneighbors on Purvis Street (54 RR 44).\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f      He denied assaulting Kimberly in Port Arthur (54 RR 46). Rather, after she\n\ndisapproved of him going to a recording studio, she slapped him, and then cut him\n\non the chest with a knife (54 RR 49-50). He reported her assault of him to the\n\npolice (54 RR 50).\n\n\n      On the day of Kimberly’s death, Petetan came to Waco from Port Arthur to\n\npick up some property and return some money to Kimberly (54 RR 52). Miller\n\nand Mouton came with him because he did not know the way from Port Arthur to\n\nWaco (54 RR 52). Once they arrived, he rented a motel room for Miller and\n\nMouton (54 RR 55).\n\n\n      Petetan drove to Kimberly’s apartment and she let him come inside (54 RR\n\n57). He denied crouching down behind a man and rushing into her apartment\n\nwhen the door was opened (54 RR 57). He denied having a gun in the apartment\n\n(54 RR 123). He, Kimberly, and A. W., drove to the motel to pick up Miller and\n\nMouton (54 RR 60). Before they went back to Kimberly’s apartment, they stopped\n\nfor Kimberly to buy some marijuana (54 RR 63).\n\n\n      Once they returned to Kimberly’s apartment, Pertetan and Kimberly went\n\nupstairs and Mouton and Miller remained downstairs (54 RR 63). Petetan did not\n\nhave a gun, but Miller had brought a gun from Port Arthur for protection because\n\nthis was his first trip to Waco (54 RR 63).\n\n                                        - 31 -\n\f      Eventually, Petetan and Kimberly went downstairs (54 RR 65). She became\n\nupset when she saw Miller eating her food (54 RR 66). Kimberly and Miller began\n\nto argue (54 RR 68). While Miller and Kimberly were near the front door, Petetan\n\nheard Miller say “fuck this bitch” and then saw Miller shoot Kimberly (54 RR 71).\n\nWhen Petetan tried to call 911, Miller pointed the gun at him and took his phone\n\n(54 RR 73).\n\n\n      The four of them left with Miller driving and A. W. pleading with Petetan\n\nnot to let Miller hurt her (54 RR 73). Petetan only got into the vehicle to protect A.\n\nW. from Miller (54 RR 144). Miller wanted to throw A. W. out of the vehicle\n\nwhile traveling down the highway or take her to Houston and kill her (54 RR 76).\n\nWhen they stopped at a truck stop in Bryan, Petetan told the clerk that his daughter\n\nwas in the vehicle, she had been kidnapped, and his wife had been shot in Waco\n\n(54 RR 77).\n\n\n      Eventually, Petetan’s vehicle was stopped because of the information he\n\ngave to the clerk at the truck stop (54 RR 78). When an officer approached the\n\nvehicle, Petetan told her that Miller had kidnapped his daughter and shot his wife\n\n(54 RR 79). When he was interrogated at the police station, Petetan repeated that\n\nMiller had kidnapped his daughter and shot his wife (54 RR 80). The defense\n\nrested (54 RR 156)\n\n\n                                        - 32 -\n\f      In rebuttal, the State called Michael Tovar who was an inmate at the\n\nMcLennan County Jail with Petetan (54 RR 158). In jail, Petetan referred to\n\nKimberly as “that bitch” (54 RR 162). Petetan told Tovar that he shot Kimberly\n\n“boom-boom-boom” (54 RR 166). Petetan said he was willing to talk about the\n\nmurder because the State would be unable to charge him due to his “mental state”\n\n(54 RR 168).\n\n\n      The State rested on rebuttal and both sides closed (54 RR 173). No\n\nobjections were voiced to the court’s charge and it was read to the jury (54 RR\n\n174, 176). Argument was presented (54 RR 188, 197, and 215). The jury found\n\nPetetan guilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment (54 RR 224).\n\n\n                               C. Punishment Phase\n\n\n      Ramona Pitre is a public school teacher in Port Arthur (55 RR 21). In 1989,\n\nPetetan was in her in-school suspension program (55 RR 26). He was angry,\n\nresistant, and disruptive in class (55 RR 27). On May 24, 1989, Petetan threw a\n\nlunch tray full of food at her when she tried to make him sit in the correct seat (55\n\nRR 29). She does not believe Petetan is mentally intellectually disabled (55 RR\n\n31). She believed he cannot follow rules and misbehaves (55 RR 31). In twenty\n\nfive years of teaching, she has never had a student with intellectual disability,\n\nmental problems, or mental illness in one of her classes (55 RR 32).\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\f      Edward Cockrell is with the Jefferson County Juvenile Probation\n\nDepartment (55 RR 36). In 1990, Petetan was placed in intensive supervision\n\njuvenile probation for assaulting Pitre and the offense of criminal mischief against\n\nanother person (55 RR 41). Petetan did not comply with the terms of probation\n\nand was eventually committed to the Brownwood State School (55 RR 49).\n\nPetetan returned to Port Arthur on juvenile parole and continued engaging in\n\ncriminal conduct (55 RR 50).\n\n\n      Eventually, it was decided to pursue certification for prosecution as an adult\n\nafter Petetan shot Fredrick Nico with a gun in March of 1992 (55 RR 50, 51, and\n\n55). Cockrell’s certification analysis was admitted into evidence (55 RR 53, 62\n\nRR SX 133). When Petetan was 16 years of age, an IQ test administered yielded a\n\nscore of 64 on a child’s test and 74 on an adult test (55 RR 65, 62 RR SX 133). A\n\ndoctor described Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled in connection with\n\ntesting conducted relative to the certification proceeding (55 RR 66). Eventually,\n\nCockrell recommended Petetan be certified and tried as an adult for various\n\noffenses he committed while under 17 years of age (55 RR 72). He was certified\n\nto stand trial as an adult (55 RR 82).\n\n\n      Records from the former Texas Youth Commission regarding Petetan were\n\nadmitted into evidence (55 RR 87, 62 RR SX 128). Those records reflect an IQ\n\n\n                                         - 34 -\n\fscore of 61 for Petetan when he was admitted to TYC at the age of 15 in 1991 (62\n\nRR SX 128).\n\n\n        The juvenile certification proceedings related to Petetan were admitted into\n\nevidence and published to the jury (55 RR 82, 62 RR SX 130). The exhibit reflects\n\nPetetan’s date of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n        Leonard Cucolo testified that Petetan was received by the Brownwood State\n\nSchool in 1991 after his juvenile probation for burglary was revoked (55 RR 84,\n\n87). He was at the Brownwood School for four months before returning to Port\n\nArthur on juvenile parole (55 RR 93). While at the Brownwood School, Petetan\n\nwas diagnosed as mildly intellectually disabled (55 RR 103).\n\n\n        Port Arthur Police Department Officer Brian Broussard responded to a\n\nshooting report on March 21, 1992 (55 RR 107-108). He spoke with the victim,\n\nFredrick Nico, who told him that Petetan had shot him with a gun (55 RR 110).\n\nPetetan shot Nico twice, and then tried to shoot him in the head, but the gun\n\nmisfired (55 RR 111-112). Nico related the shooting was unprovoked (55 RR\n\n112).\n\n\n        Petetan was arrested for the shooting of Nico (55 RR 113). When he was 16\n\nyears of age, Petetan was certified to stand trial as an adult and received a 20 year\n\nsentence for the attempted murder of Nico (55 RR 115).\n                                        - 35 -\n\f      On March 21, 1992, Fredrick Nico, was at Petetan’s house in Port Arthur\n\ndrinking beer in the backyard (55 RR 124). Nico was carrying a pistol for\n\nprotection (55 RR 122). When Nico put the pistol on a table, Petetan grabbed it\n\nand ran to an alley (55 RR 126). When Petetan returned from the alley, he pointed\n\nthe pistol at Nico and shot him twice (55 RR 128). Nico denied that Petetan tried\n\nto shoot him a third time in the head (55 RR 129).\n\n\n      Nico later learned that Petetan was prosecuted for his attempted murder (55\n\nRR 131). Nico has known Petetan for 25 years and does not consider him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (55 RR 134).\n\n\n      Judge Vi McGinnis previously served as a Justice of the Peace in Jefferson\n\nCounty (55 RR 150). His duties included giving warnings to arrested juveniles and\n\nreviewing any written statements given by juveniles to police before they were\n\nsigned by the juvenile (55 RR 153). Following his arrest for the attempted murder\n\nof Nico, McGinnis gave Petetan his statutory warnings (55 RR 156). McGinnis\n\nalso reviewed the statement Petetan provided to the police concerning the shooting\n\nof Nico (55 RR 157). The statement reflected Petetan shot Nico because Nico had\n\npreviously beat him, Nico had laughed at Petetan’s mother, and Nico laughed\n\nwhen he learned that Petetan’s friend “Pee Wee” had been killed (55 RR 159).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 36 -\n\f        Officer Tony Barker, of the Beaumont Police Department, responded to a\n\ncall from the Jefferson County Juvenile Detention Center in April of 1992 (55 RR\n\n165). He spoke with a teacher at the Center who reported that Petetan had\n\nphysically assaulted her (55 RR 166). Barker arrested Petetan for assaulting the\n\nteacher (55 RR 168).\n\n\n        Raffiel Dugas testified that when he was 15 or 16 year old, he fought with\n\nPetetan inside a club in Port Arthur (55 RR 173, 177). Petetan hit Dugas with a\n\nchair rendering Dugas unconscious (55 RR 179). Petetan then proceeded to beat\n\nDugas with the chair while he was unconscious on the floor (55 RR 180). Dugas\n\nsustained multiple injuries and was in the hospital for a week (55 RR 180-182).\n\nHe later learned that Petetan went to prison for assaulting him with a chair (55 RR\n\n180).\n\n\n        Max Wolgast, of the Port Arthur Police Department, responded to a shooting\n\non January 14, 1993 (55 RR 186). Victor Loeb was shot in a drive-by shooting\n\nwhile walking in his neighborhood (55 RR 187). He sustained three gunshot\n\nwounds (55 RR 188). Petetan was arrested for the shooting three days later and the\n\nhandgun used in the shooting was found in his mother’s home (55 RR 189).\n\nPetetan was sent to prison for shooting Loeb (55 RR 190).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\f      Kari Biddix previously lived in Port Arthur (55 RR 192). She recalled an\n\nincident when she heard gunshots outside her home and saw an older man limping\n\nand grabbing his side on the sidewalk (55 RR 193). She approached the man and\n\nhe said “I’ve been shot” (55 RR 196). After learning the man’s name, she and her\n\nsister drove to Loeb’s house and told his wife that her husband had been shot (55\n\nRR 197).\n\n\n      On June 28, 1992, Corey Mendoza was a detention officer in the Jefferson\n\nCounty Jail (55 RR 202). He responded to a fire set in a cell occupied by Petetan\n\nand another inmate (55 RR 203). After Mendoza extinguished the fire, Petetan\n\nsaid he would start another fire if he was not moved to a different cell (55 RR 204).\n\nMendoza later received a report that Petetan was throwing water on other inmates\n\nas they walked by his cell (55 RR 206). Jail records reflect Petetan’s date of birth\n\nas February 7, 1976 (55 RR 203).\n\n\n      On February 9, 1993, while working as a jailer in the Jefferson County Jail,\n\nMark Beadle responded to an inmate who had been burned when Petetan threw hot\n\nwater on him (55 RR 210-211). His records reflect Petetan assaulted another\n\ninmate in jail on May 28, 1993 (55 RR 213).\n\n\n      The pen packets from Petetan’s five prior felony convictions were admitted\n\ninto evidence (55 RR 217, 62 RR SX 131). The packets reflect that on July 7,\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\f1993, he pleded guilty to five felony offenses committed while he was a 16 year\n\nold juvenile (62 RR SX 131). Those offenses were two attempted murders and\n\nthree aggravated assaults (62 RR SX 131). Pursuant to a plea bargain, he received\n\ntwo 20 year sentences and three 10 year sentences to be served concurrently (62\n\nRR SX 131). He was received at the Department of Corrections when he was 17\n\nyears of age on August 27, 1993 (62 RR SX 131). Prison records reflected his IQ\n\ntesting was scored at 69 with a notation he was expelled following the eighth grade\n\n(62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Joseph Blanton was previously employed as a prison guard at the Ferguson\n\nUnit of TDCJ (55 RR 230).

On July 24, 1994, he responded to screams from a cell occupied\n\nby Petetan and Christopher Robinson (56 RR 7). Robinson was covered in blood\n\nand had injuries to his face and head (56 RR 9). Robinson was holding a sock\n\nwhich contained a padlock (56 RR 9). Petetan had no injuries (56 RR 9). Petetan\n\nwas administratively charged with attacking another inmate with a weapon (56 RR\n\n11).\n\n\n       James Simmons previously worked as a prison guard at the Clements Unit of\n\nTDCJ (56 RR 19). On June 3, 1995, Petetan approached Simmons and asked to be\n\nhis boyfriend (56 RR 19). Petetan told Simmons that he loved him and wanted to\n\nlive with him when he was released from prison (56 RR 20). Petetan was\n\nadministratively charged with soliciting an officer (56 RR 20).\n\n\n       Kellie Dossett previously worked as a prison guard at the McConnell Unit of\n\nTDCJ (56 RR 26).

Petetan had no interest in television or games\n\nas a child (56 RR 122). He would simply sit on the floor or go walking by himself\n\nwithout first telling his mother where he was going (56 RR 122). He was\n\ncommitted to a psychiatric hospital at age 15 before he went to the Brownwood\n\nState School (56 RR 128).\n\n\n      Petetan was never able to get a driver license because he was unable to pass\n\nthe written portion of the test (56 RR 123).

He\n\nwas real quiet and slower than her children (56 RR 245-246). Petetan did not\n\nattend school for the year he spent with Gauthier (56 RR 251).\n\n\n      Petetan’s cousin, Caston Gauthier, visited Petetan while he was in prison (56\n\nRR 26). When Petetan told Gauthier that he wanted to be a bondsman or rapper\n\nwhen released from prison, Gauthier thought Petetan did not have the intellectual\n\nability to engage in such professions (56 RR 263-264). He never thought Petetan\n\nwas intellectually disabled (56 RR 265).\n\n\n      Kimberly Jackson is Petetan’s cousin and the daughter of Cathy Gauthier\n\n(56 RR 272). She and Petetan are the same age (56 RR 272). She remembered\n\n\n\n                                      - 44 -\n\fthat when Petetan was living with her family, he was not on her level “mind-wise”\n\nand intellectually slower than her (56 RR 272, 274).\n\n\n        Thomas Kemper is Petetan’s uncle (56 RR 276). Petetan has been\n\nintellectually slow since birth (56 RR 279). He was in special education classes in\n\nschool (56 RR 280). As a child, Petetan refused to bathe or groom himself (56 RR\n\n281).\n\n\n        Dr. Ray Coxe is a psychologist from Beaumont (56 RR 313). In 1992, he\n\nwas performing psychological examinations for the court system in Jefferson\n\nCounty in connection with whether juveniles should be certified as adults for\n\npurposes of prosecution (56 RR 315). He examined Petetan at the request of the\n\njuvenile probation department in connection with a pending attempted murder\n\ncharge and whether Petetan should be certified as an adult (56 RR 316-317).\n\nPetetan was 16 years of age at the time of the examination (56 RR 316).\n\n\n        In view of his age, Coxe administered IQ tests for both children and adults to\n\nPetetan (56 RR 318). He explained the child test goes up to age 17 while the adult\n\ntest goes down to age 16 (56 RR 318). Petetan’s full scale IQ on the child version\n\nwas 64 which places him in the lower three percent (56 RR 322). Petetan’s full\n\nscale IQ on the adult test was 74 which places him in the lower four percent (56\n\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\fRR 323). Due to testing differences between the two tests, it is not unusual for the\n\nadult test to be 10 points higher than the child test (56 RR 323).\n\n\n      Coxe also administered achievement tests to Petetan (56 RR 354). The tests\n\nare scored like an IQ test (56 RR 354). Petetan scored 70 on reading, 61 on\n\nspelling, and 46 on mathematics (56 RR 354). Based on testing and evaluation in\n\n1992, Coxe believed Petetan to be mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n\n\n      Dr. Harold Scott, a psychiatrist, was previously a consultant for the Texas\n\nYouth Commission at the Brownwood State School (57 RR 40. 43). He examined\n\nPetetan at the school in 1991 when Petetan was 15 years old (57 RR 45). Scott\n\ndiagnosed Petetan with a conduct disorder and mild mental disability (57 RR 53).\n\nScott explained that mild mental disability meant an IQ score between 55 and 69\n\n(57 RR 55). The diagnosis was based in part on previous IQ testing of Petetan (57\n\nRR 56).\n\n\n      Edmond Stewart is a former professional boxer (57 RR 92). For the last five\n\nyears, he has been a pastor at a jail ministry in the McLennan County Jail (57 RR\n\n95). Stewart met with Petetan in jail and found it hard to have a conversation with\n\nhim because his mind tends to “wander off” (57 RR 98).\n\n\n      Ellis Craig is a psychologist with 47 years of experience working in the area\n\nof adaptive behavior assessments (58 RR 7). He performed an adaptive behavior\n                                        - 46 -\n\fassessment of Petetan by administering a test, reviewing records, and speaking\n\nwith Petetan’s relatives (58 RR 18, 34, and 38). When speaking with Petetan’s\n\nrelatives, Craig sought to determine adaptive behavior before the time Petetan went\n\nto prison at 17 years of age (58 RR 67). Most of the answers provided to his\n\nquestions were examples of adaptive deficits from the time Petetan was a youth of\n\n14 or 15 years old and had not yet gone to prison (58 RR 68). Craig believed\n\nPetetan was forthcoming with him during the assessment and did not intentionally\n\nattempt to underestimate his abilities (58 RR 39).\n\n\n      The information gathered from Petetan’s relatives was graded for adaptive\n\ndisabilities (58 RR 40). The information from Petetan’s mother placed Petetan so\n\nlow that Craig did not consider it reliable (58 RR 40). Petetan’s brother and sister\n\nranked his social skills at the best, conceptual skills second, and practical skills at\n\nthe lowest (58 RR 41).\n\n\n      The scoring of adaptive assessment is similar to scoring on an IQ test with\n\nthe norm in the 85 to 115 range (58 RR 42). The results of the assessment done by\n\nCraig were based on input from Petetan and his relatives and the scores were as\n\nfollows: brother 53; uncle and sister 47; Petetan 42; and Petetan’s mother 40.\n\n\n      Craig concluded Petetan’s adaptive limitations far outweigh his limited skills\n\n(58 RR 47). Craig had to rely on retrospective assessments because there was no\n\n                                         - 47 -\n\fmeasure from when Petetan was a child other than one report noting his adaptive\n\nlimitations without concurrent testing (58 RR 48). Based on his adaptive behavior\n\ndeficits and the IQ scores he has seen, Craig considers Petetan to be moderately\n\nintellectually disabled which is more severe than mildly intellectually disabled\n\n(58 RR 48).\n\n\n      Dr. Kevin Correia, a psychologist, examined Petetan on August 8, 2012, in\n\nconnection with an application for Social Security disability benefits (58 RR 104,\n\n63 RR DX 5). Correia administered an IQ test resulting in a full scale score of 55\n\n(58 RR 104, 63 RR DX 5). Correia diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled in view of his IQ score and adaptive behavior deficits (58 RR 104, 63 RR\n\nDX 5).\n\n\n      Joan Mayfield is a neuropsychologist (58 RR 105). While Petetan was in\n\nthe McLennan County Jail awaiting trial, she administered 16 different tests to him\n\n(58 RR 124). The tests covered areas such as IQ, intellectual ability, attention,\n\nexecutive functioning, academic achievement, memory, learning, language, visual\n\nspatial, and motor coordination (58 RR 117). She did not perform any adaptive\n\nbehavior assessment testing and relied on the testing by Dr. Craig (58 RR 231).\n\n\n      Mayfield explained that one of the components of intellectual disability is\n\nsub-average intellectual functioning as shown by a full scale IQ score of 70 or\n\n                                        - 48 -\n\fbelow, namely, two standard deviations below the mean (58 RR 129). She also\n\nconsidered and looked for evidence of an onset of the condition before the age of\n\n18 (58 RR 132).\n\n\n      Mayfield was provided access to various records including Petetan’s school\n\nrecords and previous psychological testing (58 RR 133). She noted Petetan was\n\nrequired to repeat both the third and sixth grades in school (58 RR 133). He was\n\nsocially promoted to the fourth grade rather than being required to repeat the third\n\ngrade three times (58 RR 133). He ultimately dropped out of school in the ninth\n\ngrade (58 RR 220).\n\n\n      Her testing of Petetan revealed global delays in intellectual ability,\n\nacademic, executive functioning, problem solving, memory, language, motor\n\nskills, and visual perception (58 RR 185). He suffers from sub-average intellectual\n\nfunctioning with an onset before the age of 18 (58 RR 185-186). Her testing\n\nrevealed a full scale IQ score of 52 (58 RR 190). The IQ testing results were\n\nconsistent with other IQ testing results of Petetan she was provided (58 RR 244).\n\n\n      She explained that at the time Coxe administered the child and adult\n\nversions of an IQ test to Petetan, there was a problem in correlating the results and\n\nthose scoring on the lower end of child’s IQ test typically scored 10 to 15 points\n\nbetter on the adult version (58 RR 228). When the tests were revised, the norms\n\n                                        - 49 -\n\ffor the tests were adjusted and there is now good reliability between the two tests\n\nso that the scores are now similar (58 RR 228). She believed Coxe found the\n\nchild’s score of 64 to be more reliable than the adult score of 74 and that is the\n\nreason he diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 228). The\n\ndefense rested on punishment (58 RR 248).\n\n\n      In rebuttal, the State called Meshia Hicks (59 RR 34). Hicks was a clerk at\n\nthe C & E Motel in Waco on September 23, 2012 (59 RR 37). Petetan saw her at\n\nthe motel and asked for a ride to The Landing apartment complex (59 RR 40).\n\nWith Petetan in her car, they drove around the parking lot of the complex (59 RR\n\n41). Petetan told her he was looking for a drug dealer driving a black car (59 RR\n\n41). No such car was observed and they returned to the motel (59 RR 42).\n\n\n      Dorothy Stamps is a retired public school teacher from Port Arthur (59 RR\n\n45). Petetan was in her first grade class (59 RR 50). She did not believe him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 50). Rather, he was a coward and tended to run\n\naway from trouble (59 RR 53).\n\n\n      Eddie Fowler was the principal of the middle school attended by Petetan (59\n\nRR 59). He recalled that he caught Petetan smoking in the bathroom and that\n\nPetetan shot another student off campus (59 RR 62). Petetan was placed in special\n\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\feducation classes because he was a discipline problem (59 RR 63). Otherwise, he\n\nwas an average student and not intellectually disabled (59 RR 63-64).\n\n\n      Petetan’s school records were admitted into evidence (59 RR 69, 63 RR DX\n\n10). Those records reflect he failed two grades and was socially promoted in\n\nanother grade (59 RR 66). He withdrew from school in the eighth grade (63 RR\n\nDX 10).\n\n\n      Mattie Howe was Petetan’s parole officer in Beaumont from May to\n\nSeptember of 2012 (59 RR 70-71). He was required to participate in anger\n\nmanagement classes as part of his parole (59 RR 74). Howe does not believe\n\nPetetan is intellectually disabled (59 RR 75).\n\n\n      Travis Turner works for the Classification Department of TDCJ (59 RR 80).\n\nWhen Petetan was initially received at TDCJ in 1993, he scored at 69 on an IQ test\n\n(59 RR 85). He took an adaptive behavior screening test, but was never assigned\n\nto a prison unit for intellectually disabled offenders (59 RR 85-86).\n\n\n      Turner described the classification system for inmates and security measures\n\nin place for each group of inmates (59 RR 103). He explained that the Crips and\n\nBloods are not part of Security Threat Groups which are automatically housed in\n\nadministrative segregation (59 RR 104).\n\n\n\n                                        - 51 -\n\f      While Warren Kroll was working as a prison guard at the Ferguson Unit of\n\nTDCJ in 1994, he searched Petetan’s cell (59 RR 80. 111). He found a sharpened\n\npiece of steel and a padlock inside a sock (59 RR 111). Petetan was\n\nadministratively charged with possessing a weapon (59 RR 114).\n\n\n      While Robert Blanks was working as a prison guard at the Estelle Unit of\n\nTDCJ in 1998, he saw Petetan and another inmate stab two other inmates while in\n\nthe dining hall (59 RR 124). Petetan was administratively charged with assaulting\n\nanother inmate with a weapon (59 RR 126).\n\n\n      Azikiw Daniels previously served a prison sentence at the Estelle Unit of\n\nTDCJ (59 RR 131). When he heard that Petetan wanted to fight him, Daniels\n\nstruck Petetan on the head with a pipe two or three times (59 RR 138). Two days\n\nlater, Petetan stabbed Daniels while he was working in the serving line of the\n\nkitchen (59 RR 143). Daniels knew that Petetan was a member of the Crips street\n\ngang (59 RR 144).\n\n\n      Jay Hart is in charge of the TDCJ Security Threat Groups Office (59 RR\n\n152). He explained TDCJ recognizes eight different security threat groups\n\nincluding the Crips (59 RR 154). Unlike some other threat groups, Crips are not\n\nautomatically housed in administrative segregation and may have jobs in the\n\ngeneral inmate population (59 RR 159).\n\n                                       - 52 -\n\f      Hart observed various tattoos on Petetan and said they were indicative of\n\nmembership in the Crips (59 RR 161, 165). Petetan identified himself as a Crips\n\nmember to prison authorities in 1999 (59 RR 172). Hart had no record of Petetan\n\never attempting to disassociate from the Crips or renounce his membership in the\n\norganization (59 RR 182).\n\n\n      Mubarak Ali was in the McLennan County Jail on a drug charge while\n\nPetetan was awaiting his capital murder trial in March of 2014 (59 RR 199).\n\nPetetan told Ali that if he acted like he was mentally sick, he would not receive the\n\ndeath penalty (59 RR 203). When Ali asked Petetan to make a telephone call for\n\nhim, Petetan declined by explaining his calls were recorded and he was telling the\n\ncourt he was mentally sick (59 RR 205). Ali admitted he told the State of his\n\nconversations with Petetan at the urging of his lawyer (59 RR 208). Ali’s drug\n\ncharge remained pending at the time of Petetan’s trial (59 RR 200). The State\n\nrested on rebuttal and both sides closed (59 RR 209).\n\n\n      The trial court sustained one of Petetan’s objections to the charge and the\n\nremaining objections were overruled (59 RR 212, 4 CR 1313). The charge was\n\nread to the jury (60 RR 5). Argument was presented (60 RR 15, 24, and 50). The\n\njury returned answers to the four special issues submitted (60 RR 67-68, 4 CR\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\f1336-1339). Based on the jury’s answers to the special issues, punishment was\n\nassessed by the trial court at death (60 RR 71).\n\n\n                            Summary of the Argument\n\n\n      Twenty-nine points of error are presented on direct appeal. The first two\n\ncomplain of the exclusion of evidence offered by Petetan during the competency\n\ntrial. The trial court refused to allow former counsel to testify relative to Petetan’s\n\ncompetency to stand trial upon erroneously allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege to the admissibility of the evidence. In the second\n\ninstance, after the State suggested Petetan was malingering in an effort to secure a\n\nfinding of incompetency, the trial court refused to admit testimony as to the fate of\n\nthose who secure an incompetency determination through malingering.\n\n\n      Three points of error are presented urging the trial court erred by denying\n\ndefense challenges for cause to prospective jurors during voir dire examination\n\nrelative to the trial on the merits. One venireman had a bias in favor of the death\n\npenalty and a bias in favor of the credibility of law enforcement officers. The\n\nsecond venireman had a bias in favor of the death penalty. Petetan used\n\nperemptory strikes on both, was denied additional strikes, and identified an\n\nobjectionable juror he would have stricken if afforded additional strikes.\n\n\n\n                                         - 54 -\n\f      Petetan challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove the underlying\n\nfelonies which elevate the murder to the offense of capital murder. Even viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to the verdict, no rational juror could have found the\n\nmurder occurred in the course of committing or attempting to commit burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\n      Two points of error assert the trial court erred by admitting extraneous\n\noffenses during the guilt or innocence phase of trial. Those extraneous offenses\n\nwere not relevant to the charged capital murder. The offenses improperly\n\nportrayed Petetan before the jury as a violent drug dealer.\n\n\n      A point complains the trial court undermined Petetan’s right to conflict free\n\ncounsel by admitting evidence from a former client of defense counsel during the\n\npunishment phase of trial. Trial counsel was placed in an impossible position of\n\neffectively representing Petetan while not revealing attorney-client confidences in\n\ncross-examination of his former client.\n\n\n      Petetan complains the jury’s rejection of his claim of intellectual disability is\n\nmanifestly unjust and against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\nConsequently he is not eligible for the death penalty. Overwhelming evidence of\n\nintellectual disability was presented to the jury. Petetan seeks for this Court to\n\nreconsider its flawed Briseno approach and adopt a clinical standards approach to\n\n                                          - 55 -\n\fthe issue as embraced by the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall. However, under\n\neither standard, he has shown himself not to be eligible for a sentence of death.\n\n\n      In fourteen points of error, Petetan maintains the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by denying his objections to the punishment phase jury charge. Petetan\n\nacknowledges the challenges have been previously rejected by this Court. They\n\nare presented for preservation of the errors and to avoid waiver.\n\n\n      A point of error complains the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment\n\nprohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. The point is based on Justice\n\nBreyer’s recent dissenting opinion in Glossip v. Gross.\n\n\n      Petetan argues he was denied equal protection of the law and due course of\n\nlaw due to the absence of a unified statutory procedure for pretrial litigation of an\n\nAtkins assertion of intellectual disability. The point is based on this Court’s recent\n\nopinion in In re Allen recognizing disparity through the state in obtaining such a\n\npretrial determination from a trial court.\n\n\n      The final two points of error seek modification of erroneous recitations\n\nwithin the judgment. Those errors concern the degree of the offense and\n\nassessment of punishment by the jury. The Court has the necessary information\n\nand authority to reform the judgment.\n\n\n\n                                         - 56 -\n\f         Petetan prays this Court will reverse the judgment of conviction and reform\n\nto an acquittal, remand for a new trial, remand for a new punishment hearing,\n\nreform the sentence to a life sentence, remand for a new competency hearing,\n\nmodify the judgment, or enter any other relief appropriate under the law and the\n\nfacts.\n\n\n                                  Point of Error One\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by allowing the State to invoke Petetan’s\n\nattorney-client privilege as to testimony he sought to offer from his former\n\nattorney on the issue of competency to stand trial (13 RR 57).\n\n\n         During the competency trial, Petetan called his former attorney, Stan\n\nSchwieger (13 RR 43). Schwieger was initially appointed to represent Petetan\n\nwhen he was charged with the offense of murdering Kimberly (13 RR 45). He met\n\nwith Petetan shortly after his appointment (13 RR 45). He met with Petetan a\n\nsecond time when the charge was upgraded to capital murder (13 RR 45). At that\n\nsecond meeting, he explained to Petetan that new counsel would be appointed\n\nbecause Schwieger was not on the list of counsel eligible for appointment on\n\ncapital murder cases (13 RR 47).\n\n\n         The State objected to any effort to present privileged information from\n\nSchwieger and the objection was sustained (13 RR 47). Petetan clarified that he\n                                         - 57 -\n\fwas simply attempting to determine whether Schwieger was able to communicate\n\nwith Petetan (13 RR 47). The State’s objection was once again sustained (13 RR\n\n48). Outside the jury, Petetan explained he was not seeking to offer confidential\n\ncommunications, he was simply attempting to show that Schwieger had difficulty\n\ncommunicating with Petetan (13 RR 50). The State again asserted such testimony,\n\neven going to a difficulty in communication, would violate the attorney-client\n\nprivilege (13 RR 50).\n\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, Schwieger testified that Petetan could not\n\nunderstand the reason he was required to withdraw from representation (13 RR\n\n52). When the State again objected, Petetan asserted the State had no standing to\n\nassert an objection based on the privilege and the testimony sought to be offered\n\nwas not privileged (13 RR 53). The State responded that even if it had no right to\n\nassert the privilege, it “had a duty to protect it” (13 RR 53). Petetan claimed the\n\nevidence concerning difficulty in communicating with counsel went to the “heart\n\nof the reason” they were having a competency trial (13 RR 56). The trial court\n\nsustained the State’s objection and excluded the evidence Petetan sought to offer\n\n(13 RR 57). When the jury returned, the trial court instructed it to disregard the\n\nentirety of Schwieger’s testimony (13 RR 61).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 58 -\n\f      A trial court's exclusion of evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\n\nOsbourn v.

Counsel was prevented from testifying to Petetan’s\n\ndifficulty in communicating with his lawyer. As stated by trial counsel, such\n\ntestimony goes to the heart of the competency inquiry. See TEX. CRIM. PROC.\n\nCODE art. 46B.003(a)(1) (sufficient present ability to consult with the person’s\n\nlawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding). Former counsel’s\n\nfirsthand knowledge of Petetan’s difficulty in communicating with counsel is\n\nqualitatively different than the opinions expressed by the experts at the competency\n\ntrial. It is likewise not comparable to the evidence at the competency trial showing\n\nPetetan is willing to lie to a police officer. The burden of proof in a competency\n\nproceeding is on the defendant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he\n\nis incompetent. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 46B.003(b). After considering the\n\n\n\n                                         - 61 -\n\frelatively low burden of proof Petetan was prevented from successfully showing to\n\nthe jury, this Court should find the exclusion of the evidence harmful.\n\n\n      A retrospective competency determination may be conducted consistent with\n\nthe requirements of due process in most cases.

The State asserted a\n\ndefendant facing a sentence of death would have a strong motive to lie or\n\n                                       - 63 -\n\fexaggerate during a competency examination (12 RR 103). The State questioned\n\nwhether Seay had the ability to determine whether Petetan lied to her during the\n\nexamination (12 RR 104). It was noted he had already visited with counsel on\n\nseveral occasions before Seay saw him (12 RR 104). She relied on Petetan to be\n\ntruthful and honest with her (12 RR 105). Seay acknowledged that if Petetan gave\n\nher incorrect or incomplete information, it would impact her opinion of his\n\ncompetency (12 RR 106). If a defendant was motivated to delay or avoid trial,\n\nSeay acknowledged he might give false information to the examiner (12 RR 111).\n\n\n      The State’s malingering defense to Petetan’s assertion of incompetency\n\ncontinued with its examination of Dr. Pittman. The State initially stressed that\n\nPittman was the court’s independent expert and had not been hired by the State (12\n\nRR 174).5 Pittman felt Petetan was not reliable during his assessment and was not\n\n“giving it his best shot” (12 RR 181, 184). He was especially suspicious when\n\nPetetan was unable to name the Dallas Cowboys as the professional football team\n\nfrom Dallas (12 RR 181).\n\n\n      On rebuttal, Petetan called his former attorney, Stan Schwieger, a criminal\n\ndefense attorney from Waco (13 RR 43). Outside the presence of the jury, Petetan\n\nasked Schwieger whether he was familiar with the procedures in place at Vernon\n\n5\n  The record reflects Pittman was appointed after being recommended by the State\n(7 RR 5).\n                                      - 64 -\n\fState Hospital for those found incompetent to stand trial through malingering (13\n\nRR 58). In response to the State’s relevancy objection, Petetan urged the\n\ntestimony was admissible in response to the State’s claim he was malingering in an\n\neffort to be found incompetent (13 RR 59). Schwieger explained that those found\n\nto have been malingering before a determination of incompetency are deemed\n\ncompetent by the hospital staff and returned to the originating county for a\n\ncompetency finding and trial (13 RR 59-60). The trial court sustained the State’s\n\nobjection and refused to allow Schwieger to testify as proffered (13 RR 60).\n\n\n      In argument, the State claimed Petetan devised a plan to avoid both trial and\n\nthe death penalty by claiming he was incompetent (13 RR 77). The State\n\nsuggested Petetan manipulated Seay during her assessment (13 RR 80). The State\n\nclaimed that Petetan lied to Pittman and faked his alleged incompetence (13 RR\n\n82, 84). The prosecutor implored the jurors not to be fooled by Petetan’s game\n\nbecause a finding of incompetency means “he ain’t going to get tried” (13 RR 82,\n\n84). That, of course, is not factually or legally true.\n\n\n      Petetan relies on the same standard of review and harm standard as set forth\n\nin the preceding point of error complaining of the exclusion of admissible and\n\nrelevant evidence. Here, Petetan had the substantial right to present all available\n\nadmissible evidence in support of his claim of incompetence. The State urged its\n\n\n                                         - 65 -\n\fdefense of malingering during cross-examination of Seay, direct examination of\n\nPittman, and during argument. In response to that defense, Petetan sought to\n\ndemonstrate that a finding of incompetency based on malingering would be\n\nshort-lived at best and would not mean “he ain’t going to get tried.”\n\n\n       The burden of proof in a competency proceeding is on the defendant to show\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence that he is incompetent. TEX. CRIM. PROC.\n\nCODE art. 46B.003(b). After considering the relatively low burden of proof\n\nPetetan was prevented from successfully showing to the jury, this Court should\n\nfind the exclusion of the evidence harmful. Petetan’s fluctuating mental condition,\n\ncombined with the mounting passage of time, suggests that a retrospective\n\ncompetency inquiry is simply not feasible in this case and a new trial should be\n\nordered.\n\n\n                               Point of Error Three\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by denying a defense challenge for cause\n\nto prospective juror Richard Hester who had a bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout possibility of parole and a bias in favor of a sentence of death (28 RR\n\n89).\n\n\n       Richard Hester was called as a prospective juror (28 RR 21). In his\n\nquestionnaire, Hester indicated he was opposed to a life sentence without parole\n                                       - 66 -\n\fbecause he saw no reason to keep someone in prison for their entire life (28 RR\n\n62). He did not believe a life sentence without parole would be sufficient\n\npunishment for one convicted of capital murder (28 RR 63). When asked by the\n\ntrial court if he could ever assess a punishment of life without parole, Hester\n\nresponded that he believed he could, but it would go against his “grain” (28 RR\n\n64).\n\n\n       Defense counsel sought to explore Hester’s “grain” (28 RR 69). Under\n\nquestioning by defense counsel, Hester agreed with the sentiment that one\n\nconvicted of capital murder should be executed rather than have the taxpayers pay\n\nfor incarceration for the rest of his life (28 RR 69). Hester said that despite his bias\n\nagainst a life sentence, he would try to answer the special issues truthfully based on\n\nwhat he believed the answer to be (28 RR 71). Hester made it clear he is in favor\n\nof the death penalty and did not believe enough sentences of death are assessed by\n\njuries (28 RR 81). Hester reiterated that he was opposed to a life sentence without\n\nparole and acknowledged he indicated on his questionnaire that life without parole\n\nis not an adequate punishment for capital murder and he saw no reason to keep a\n\nperson in prison for his entire life following a conviction for capital murder (28 RR\n\n83).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 67 -\n\f      Petetan sought to challenge Hester based on his bias against a life sentence\n\nwithout parole (28 RR 88). The challenge was denied and Petetan used his seventh\n\nperemptory strike to remove Hester (28 RR 89).\n\n\n      Petetan ultimately exhausted his peremptory strikes (47 RR 145). His\n\nrequest for an additional peremptory strike was denied (48 RR 109). Upon\n\ndenying the request for an additional strike, Petetan identified prospective juror\n\nRonald Brown as objectionable because of his work with law enforcement and\n\nprevious employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109). Had Petetan been afforded\n\nan additional strike, he would have used it on Brown (48 RR 109). Brown was\n\nselected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      A defendant may properly challenge any prospective juror who has a bias or\n\nprejudice against any of the law applicable to the case upon which the defense is\n\nentitled to rely, either as a defense to some phase of the offense for which the\n\ndefendant is being prosecuted or as a mitigation thereof or of the punishment\n\ntherefor. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 35.16(c)(2). When reviewing a trial court's\n\ndecision to grant or deny a challenge for cause, the entire record is to be considered\n\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.\n\nFeldman v.

The record does not\n\nsupport the trial court’s determination Hester was not subject to a challenge for\n\ncause by the defense. The trial court abused its discretion by denying Petetan’s\n\nchallenge.\n\n\n      To preserve error on denied challenges for cause, the appellant must\n\ndemonstrate on the record that: 1) he asserted a clear and specific challenge for\n\ncause; 2) he used a peremptory challenge on the complained-of venireperson; 3) all\n\nhis peremptory challenges were exhausted; 4) his request for additional strikes was\n\ndenied; and 5) an objectionable juror sat on the jury.

His voir dire examination revealed he believed a police\n\nofficer would be more believable than other witnesses as to matters of training and\n\nexpertise. When considering the fact that eight of the nineteen State's witnesses\n\nwere police officers, these responses become especially important. Those eight\n\npolice officers testified to matters unique to their expertise and training as law\n\nenforcement officers; the very matters to which Hester indicated he would view\n\nwith greater credibility and believability.\n\n\n      A defendant is entitled to a juror who will impartially judge the credibility of\n\nthe witnesses.

If the death\n\npenalty is available, he does not, as a taxpayer, want to pay for someone to live in\n\nprison for the rest of his life (30 RR 131, 164).

On his juror questionnaire, Fore\n\nindicated a sentence of life without parole would never be a sufficient punishment\n\nfor the offense of capital murder because “they should pay the same price” (30 RR\n\n133). Fore would expect the defense to prove the answer to the first special issue\n\nregarding future dangerousness should be “no” (30 RR 167). If he was serving as\n\na juror and reached the final special issue on mitigation, he feels a sentence of\n\ndeath would be appropriate in view of his answers to the previous special issues\n\n(30 RR 168).\n\n\n                                        - 75 -\n\f      The defense voiced a challenge for cause to Fore based on his bias against a\n\nlife sentence without the possibility of parole and bias in favor of a sentence of\n\ndeath (30 RR 174). The challenge for cause was denied by the trial court (30 RR\n\n174). Petetan used his eighth peremptory strike on Fore (30 RR 174).\n\n\n      Petetan ultimately exhausted his peremptory strikes (47 RR 145). His\n\nrequest for an additional peremptory strike was denied (48 RR 109). Upon\n\ndenying the request for an additional strike, Petetan identified prospective juror\n\nRonald Brown as objectionable because of his work with law enforcement and\n\nprevious employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109). Had Petetan been afforded\n\nan additional strike, he would have used it on Brown (48 RR 109). Brown was\n\nselected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      A defendant may properly challenge any prospective juror who has a bias or\n\nprejudice against any of the law applicable to the case upon which the defense is\n\nentitled to rely, either as a defense to some phase of the offense for which the\n\ndefendant is being prosecuted or as a mitigation thereof or of the punishment\n\ntherefor. TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art. 35.16(c)(2). When reviewing a trial court's\n\ndecision to grant or deny a challenge for cause, the entire record is to be considered\n\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.\n\nFeldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–45; Patrick, 906 S.W.2d at 488. The test is whether\n\n\n                                         - 76 -\n\fthe bias or prejudice would substantially impair the prospective juror's ability to\n\ncarry out his oath and instructions in accordance with the law. Feldman, 71\n\nS.W.3d at 743–45. Before a prospective juror may be excused for cause on this\n\nbasis, however, the law must be explained to him and he must be asked whether he\n\ncan follow that law regardless of his personal views. Id. Finally, the proponent of\n\na challenge for cause has the burden of establishing that his challenge is proper. Id.\n\nat 747. The proponent does not meet his burden until he has shown that the\n\nveniremember understood the requirements of the law and could not overcome his\n\nor her prejudice well enough to follow it. Id. When the record reflects that a\n\nvenireperson vacillated or equivocated on his or her ability to follow the law, the\n\nreviewing court must defer to the trial court. Moore, 999 S.W.2d at 400; Brown,\n\n913 S.W.2d at 580.\n\n\n      Petetan maintains Fore was subject to a defense challenge for cause due to\n\nhis opposition against a life sentence and preference for a sentence of death. Fore\n\nmade it clear through the voir dire examination that: he is “not a big fan” of life\n\nwithout parole for one convicted of capital murder; if the death penalty is\n\navailable, he does not, as a taxpayer, want to pay for someone to live in prison for\n\nthe rest of his life; in his juror questionnaire, Fore indicated a sentence of life\n\nwithout parole would never be a sufficient punishment for the offense of capital\n\nmurder because “they should pay the same price;” Fore would expect the defense\n                                          - 77 -\n\fto prove the answer to the first special issue regarding future dangerousness should\n\nbe “no;” and if he was serving as a juror and reached the final special issue on\n\nmitigation, he feels a sentence of death would be appropriate in view of his\n\nanswers to the previous special issues. The record does not support the trial court’s\n\ndetermination Fore was not subject to a challenge for cause by the defense. The\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by denying Petetan’s challenge to prospective juror\n\nFore.\n\n\n        To preserve error on denied challenges for cause, the appellant must\n\ndemonstrate on the record that: 1) he asserted a clear and specific challenge for\n\ncause; 2) he used a peremptory challenge on the complained-of venireperson; 3) all\n\nhis peremptory challenges were exhausted; 4) his request for additional strikes was\n\ndenied; and 5) an objectionable juror sat on the jury. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–\n\n45; Green, 934 S.W.2d at 105. When the trial court errs in overruling a challenge\n\nfor cause against a venireperson, the defendant is harmed if he uses a peremptory\n\nstrike to remove the venireperson and thereafter suffers a detriment from the loss\n\nof the strike. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 743–45; Demouchette, 731 S.W.2d at 83.\n\n\n        Here, Petetan properly preserved the issue. He ultimately exhausted his\n\nperemptory strikes (47 RR 145). His request for additional peremptory strike was\n\ndenied (48 RR 109). Upon denying the request for an additional strike, Petetan\n\n\n                                        - 78 -\n\fidentified prospective juror Ronald Brown as objectionable because of his work\n\nwith law enforcement and previous employment as a prison guard (48 RR 109).\n\nHad Petetan been afforded an additional strike, he would have used it on Brown\n\n(48 RR 109). Brown was selected as the twelfth juror (48 RR 110).\n\n\n      Petetan was harmed by the erroneous denial of his challenge for cause\n\nthrough the detrimental loss of a strike. The loss of that strike resulted in a juror\n\nPetetan found objectionable being seated on the jury.\n\n\n      The error only impacts the punishment phase of trial and consequently\n\nPetetan seeks a new punishment hearing. See TEX. CRIM. PROC. CODE art.\n\n44.29(c) (providing for new punishment hearing in the case of a capital murder\n\nconviction when error affects punishment only); Ransom, 920 S.W.2d at 298\n\n(holding that voir dire error in a capital murder case on an issue the jury would\n\nonly consider at punishment constitutes error affecting punishment and thus calling\n\nfor a new punishment hearing).\n\n\n                                 Point of Error Six\n\n\nThe evidence is insufficient to prove Petetan murdered the complainant while\n\nin the course of committing or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary,\n\nkidnapping, or retaliation.\n\n\n\n                                         - 79 -\n\f      The grand jury returned an indictment charging Petetan with the offense of\n\ncapital murder (1 CR 44). Specifically, it was alleged he murdered Kimberly\n\nPetetan while in the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of\n\nburglary of Kimberly Petetan’s habitation, the kidnapping of Kimberly Petetan or\n\nA. W., and retaliation against Kimberly Petetan (1 CR 44). See TEX. PEN. CODE\n\n§ 19.03(a)(2). At the conclusion of the guilt or innocence phase of trial, the court\n\ncharged the jury (4 CR 1300). The jury was instructed it could convict if it found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Petetan murdered Kimberly while in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offenses of burglary, kidnapping, or\n\nretaliation (4 CR 1300). The jury was instructed it did not have to unanimously\n\nagree on a particular underlying felony, just that the murder occurred during one or\n\nmore of the underlying and alleged felonies (4 CR 1300). The jury found Petetan\n\nguilty of capital murder as charged in the indictment (4 CR 1308).\n\n\n       This point of error challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove\n\nPetetan murdered while in the course of committing or attempting to commit one\n\nof the underlying felonies alleged in the indictment. The state of the evidence is\n\nsuch that no rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Petetan\n\ncommitted one of the underlying felonies. Petetan seeks to have the judgment\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 80 -\n\freformed to a conviction for the offense of murder and the cause remanded for a\n\nnew punishment hearing.6\n\n\n       In a due-process review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a\n\nconviction, the reviewing court is to view all of the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

Evidence at trial showed Petetan told Miller and Mouton to\n\nget in the bed of the truck and they all drove to Kimberly’s apartment complex and\n\n\n                                        - 82 -\n\fthey entered the apartment when Kimberly opened the door (53 RR 54, 56).\n\nMouton testified that he and Miller got in the bed of Kimberly’s truck and she\n\ndrove the five of them to her apartment and they all entered the apartment when\n\nKimberly opened the door to the apartment (53 RR 110, 111, and 131). A. W.\n\nstated that the five of them left the motel, returned to her mother’s apartment, and\n\neveryone went inside (53 RR 183, 184). Kimberly was shot two hours after they\n\narrived at the apartment (53 RR 56).\n\n\n      The evidence fails to support the allegation of a burglary of Kimberly’s\n\napartment. The undisputed evidence shows that before the shooting, Kimberly\n\nopened her apartment for Petetan, Miller, Mouton, and her daughter to enter. In\n\nview of that evidence, the State failed to show Petetan entered the apartment\n\nwithout the effective consent of Kimberly. See TEX. PEN.

The evidence clearly shows the complainant was not killed during\n\nPetetan’s initial burglarious conduct. She was only killed after having left her\n\napartment and then later consented to Petetan’s entry before her shooting. The\n\nevidence does not show the complainant was killed while Petetan was in the course\n\nof committing or attempting to commit burglary of a habitation.\n\n\n      The evidence also fails to demonstrate Petetan restrained either Kimberly or\n\nA. W. with intent to prevent their liberation in the course of the capital murder.\n\nSee TEX. PEN. CODE §§ 20.01(2) and 20.03(b). Absent such evidence, the\n\nevidence will only support a conviction for the offense of murder.\n\n\n      Miller testified that as Kimberly was trying to walk out the front door,\n\nPetetan slammed the door shut, struck her with his fist, and then shot her multiple\n\ntimes (53 RR 57, 59). Miller stated that no one told A. W. and Mouton to get in\n\nPetetan’s Suburban, they simply did so after the shooting (53 RR 90).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 84 -\n\f      Mouton testified that when Kimberly and Petetan came downstairs in her\n\napartment, she tried to unlock and open the front door, but Petetan pushed her\n\naway and into a wall (53 RR 117). When Kimberly pushed Petetan back, he shot\n\nher multiple times with a handgun (53 RR 118). After the shooting, Mouton and\n\nA. W. ran out the back door of the apartment and jumped into Petetan’s vehicle\n\n(53 RR 121). Mouton intended to drive the two of them away, but Miller and\n\nPetetan came outside and entered the vehicle before he could do so (53 RR 121).\n\nMouton did not force A. W. to get in the vehicle with him; she simply followed\n\nhim out of the apartment after the shooting of her mother (53 RR 135).\n\n\n      A. W. testified that when her mother tried to open the front door, Petetan\n\nran toward the door, shut it, and pushed her mother into a wall (53 RR 190).\n\nPetetan told her mother to stand on the stairs, that it was “time for her dust away,”\n\nand then he shot her three times (53 RR 191). Her mother fell to the ground and\n\n“flopped around like a fish” (53 RR 192).\n\n\n      The younger of two other men in the apartment, Mouton, grabbed her and\n\ntook her out the back door of the apartment (53 RR 192). He told her that\n\neverything would be okay (53 RR 193). All four of them then got in Petetan’s\n\nwhite Suburban and left (53 RR 195).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 85 -\n\f      Even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, Petetan\n\nmaintains the evidence is insufficient to prove he committed or attempted to\n\ncommit the offense of kidnapping against either Kimberly or A. W. Neither was\n\nsecreted or held in a place where they were not likely to be found. See TEX. PEN.\n\nCODE § 20.01(2)(A). Neither was restrained by the use of or threat to use deadly\n\nforce. See TEX. PEN. CODE § 20.01(2)(B).\n\n\n      Petetan concedes the evidence shows that hours before the shooting, he\n\npushed his way into the apartment without Kimberly inviting him in, pulled a gun\n\nfrom his pocket, and started waving it around the apartment (53 RR 174, 175).\n\nPetetan told Kimberly to get dressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). The three\n\nof them got into Kimberly’s truck and Kimberly was driving (53 RR 177). Petetan\n\nstill had the gun in his pocket while in the truck (53 RR 178). Petetan directed\n\nKimberly to drive to a motel in Waco (53 RR 179). Once they arrived at the motel,\n\nPetetan told Kimberly to honk the horn of the truck (53 RR 180). Two men came\n\nout of a room and got in the bed of the truck (53 RR 180). All five individuals left\n\nthe motel and returned to her mother’s apartment (53 RR 183). While that conduct\n\nconstituted a kidnapping of both Kimberly and A. W., it was so removed in time as\n\nto not have a nexus to the later shooting of Kimberly sufficient to support the\n\nconviction for capital murder. The evidence clearly shows the complainant was\n\nnot killed during Petetan’s initial kidnapping. She was only killed after having left\n                                        - 86 -\n\fher apartment and then later returning to her own apartment before the shooting.\n\nPetetan was not shown to have restrained Kimberly or A. W. in the apartment\n\nupon returning and before the shooting. Finally, A. W. was shown to have\n\nvoluntarily left with Mouton following the shooting of her mother. The evidence\n\ndoes not show the complainant was killed while Petetan was in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offenses of kidnapping against either\n\nKimberly or A. W.\n\n\n      Finally, the evidence fails to demonstrate Petetan murdered Kimberly while\n\nin the course of attempting or committing the offense of retaliation. See TEX. PEN.\n\nCODE § 36.06. The evidence fails to show he threatened to harm Kimberly in\n\nretaliation for her reporting his assault of her in Port Arthur. § 36.06(a)(1)(B).\n\nLikewise, there is insufficient evidence to show Petetan harmed or threated to harm\n\nKimberly to prevent or delay her service as a witness or a person who had reported\n\na crime. § 36.06(a)(2)(A) &(B). Absent such evidence, the evidence will only\n\nsupport a conviction for the offense of murder rather than capital murder.\n\n\n      On September 13, 2012, Ryan Kidwell, of the Port Arthur Police\n\nDepartment, responded to a domestic disturbance call (52 RR 83). Kimberly\n\nPetetan told Kidwell that Petetan assaulted her when she asked him to stop\n\nsmoking in the apartment because her daughter has asthma (52 RR 85). She said\n\n\n                                        - 87 -\n\fPetetan had thrown her to the floor and held a kitchen knife close to her (52 RR\n\n86). While holding the knife close to her, Petetan said “I could kill you, do you\n\nwant to die in front of your child?” (52 RR 88).\n\n\n       Petetan had left the apartment by the time Kidwell arrived (52 RR 87).\n\nKimberly told the officer she wanted to file assault charges against Petetan and she\n\nknew it would be a felony since he used a knife during the assault (52 RR 90). She\n\nalso told the officer she was leaving Port Arthur and moving back to Waco (52 RR\n\n93).\n\n\n       A. W. testified that when her mother opened the door in Waco 10 days after\n\nher assault in Port Arthur, Petetan pushed his way into the apartment without her\n\nmother inviting him in (53 RR 174). Petetan pulled a gun from his pocket and\n\nstarted waving it around the apartment (53 RR 175). Petetan told her mother to get\n\ndressed and “come with me” (53 RR 176). Petetan told her mother they were\n\ngoing to Port Arthur and she was “going to tell the cops what happened” (53 RR\n\n177). Rather than go to Port Arthur, they traveled to a motel in Waco in picked up\n\nMiller and Mouton (53 RR 180). The five of them left the motel and returned to\n\nKimberly’s apartment (53 RR 183).\n\n\n       For purposes of the retaliation statute, the State must prove harm or a threat\n\nto harm in retaliation or to prevent service.

CODE § 1.07(25).\n\n\n      Here, the evidence fails to show Petetan harmed or threatened to harm\n\nKimberly in retaliation for reporting his assault of her. Likewise, there is\n\ninsufficient evidence to show Petetan harmed or threated to harm Kimberly to\n\nprevent or delay her service as a witness or a person who had reported a crime. At\n\nmost, the evidence simply shows Petetan intended to take Kimberly to Port Arthur\n\nand she was “going to tell the cops what happened” (53 RR 177). Such a stated\n\nintention does not constitute harm or a threat of harm. On the contrary, taken at\n\nface value, the stated intent is to safely transport her to Port Arthur to provide\n\ninformation to the authorities on the previously reported assault. Absent evidence\n\nof harm or threaten to harm in relation to the prior assault, the evidence does not\n\nsupport a conviction for capital murder.\n\n\n      Petetan has demonstrated that none of the underlying aggravating elements\n\nfind evidentiary support in the record. This Court should reform the judgment to\n\nthe offense of murder and remand the cause to the trial court for a new punishment\n\nproceeding.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 89 -\n\f                              Point of Error Seven\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Miller he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and would give Miller drugs if he would drive Petetan to\n\nWaco (53 RR 31).\n\n\n                              Point of Error Eight\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting an extraneous offense\n\nshowing that on the day of the murder, Petetan told Mouton he was going to\n\nWaco to buy drugs and will give Mouton drugs if he would accompany\n\nPetetan to Waco (53 RR 31).\n\n\n      The State proffered evidence it sought to present showing Petetan told Miller\n\nhe was coming to Waco on the day of the murder to buy drugs and would give\n\nMiller drugs in return for driving him to Waco (53 RR 28). The State claimed such\n\nevidence was admissible to show Miller’s motive for coming to Waco on the day\n\nof the murder and to rebut the defense assertion in opening that Miller murdered\n\nKimberly (53 RR 28). The defense objected that such evidence was an\n\ninadmissible extraneous offense (53 RR 29). The trial court overruled Petetan’s\n\nobjection and granted him a running objection to the evidence the State sought to\n\noffer (53 RR 31-32).\n                                       - 90 -\n\f      In the presence of the jury, Miller testified he and Petetan have known each\n\nother since they grew up in Port Arthur (53 RR 34). Early in the morning of\n\nSeptember 23, 2012, Miller saw Petetan at a convenience store in Port Arthur (53\n\nRR 36). Petetan told Miller he was going to Waco to buy some drugs and needed\n\nMiller to drive him to Waco (53 RR 36-37). Petetan offered to give Miller an\n\nounce of crack cocaine and some money if he would drive him to Waco (53 RR\n\n37). Miller did not know Petetan was married or his wife’s name (53 RR 39, 53).\n\nHe met Kimberly and A. W. for the first time when they picked him up at the\n\nmotel in Waco with Petetan (53 RR 52). He did not kill Kimberly, never had any\n\nintention to kill her, and did not know her before they met in Waco on the day of\n\nher death (53 RR 75, 78).\n\n\n      Mouton testified that Petetan asked him to accompany him to Waco on the\n\nday of the murder (53 RR 100). Petetan said he was going to Waco to buy five\n\nounces of drugs and would give Mouton two of the five ounces if he would come\n\nwith him to Waco (53 RR 101). They went to a convenience store, picked up\n\nMiller, and started driving toward Waco (53 RR 102). Mouton did not know\n\nPetetan was married or had a wife in Waco (53 RR 103).\n\n\n      An extraneous offense is any act of misconduct, whether resulting in\n\nprosecution or not, that is not shown in the charging papers and shown to have\n\n\n                                       - 91 -\n\fbeen committed by the accused.

EVID. 404(b) as\n\ncharacter conformity evidence. The extraneous offenses and bad acts had no\n\nrelevance to the capital murder charge pending against Petetan.\n\n\n      The State claimed such evidence was admissible to show Miller’s motive for\n\ncoming to Waco on the day of the murder and to rebut the defense assertion in\n\nPetetan’s opening statement that Miller murdered Kimberly (53 RR 28). Neither\n\nof the reasons supports admission of the extraneous offenses involving Miller and\n\nMouton. Their motive for coming to Waco on the day of the murder was irrelevant\n\nto the charged offense. A review of the defense opening statement does not\n\n\n                                        - 93 -\n\fsupport the State’s claim that Petetan suggested Miller was responsible for the\n\nmurder (51 RR 40-44).\n\n\n      The trial court agreed the extraneous offences were admissible to show\n\nmotive, intent, and preparation (53 RR 32). Petetan disagrees.\n\n\n      The extraneous conduct was not necessary to prove intent in the instant\n\nprosecution. Petetan’s intent to cause serious bodily injury or death could be\n\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon, a firearm. See Arnold v.

The extraneous offenses did not prove the existence of a\n\nlarger plan of which the capital murder was a part.

The\n      inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to support the\n      result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so,\n      whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left\n      in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.” 328 U.S. at 765.\n\n\n      The Supreme Court has defined “grave doubts” to mean “in the judge's\n\nmind, the matter is so evenly balanced that he feels himself in virtual equipoise as\n\nto the harmlessness of the error.” Webb v.

Thus, the proper inquiry is whether the\n\ntrial court's error in allowing the State to introduce evidence of other crimes,\n                                           - 96 -\n\fwrongs, and acts by Petetan substantially swayed or influenced the jury's verdict,\n\nor whether this Court is left in grave doubt as to whether this extraneous offense\n\nevidence substantially swayed or influenced the jury's verdict. See Kotteakos, 328\n\nU.S. at 765; Johnson, 43 S.W.3d at 4. In making that determination, this Court\n\nshould consider the trial court's erroneous admission of the extraneous offense\n\nevidence in the context of the entire record and not just whether there was\n\nsufficient or overwhelming evidence of Petetan’s guilt.

Abdnor, 871\n\nS.W.2d at 738. Here, the erroneous admission of the other crimes, wrongs, and\n\nacts, was of such a magnitude that in all probability it disrupted the jury's orderly\n\nevaluation of the evidence and had a devastating impact on the jury's rational\n\ndisposition towards other evidence. The natural inclination of the jury was to infer\n\nPetetan’s guilt of capital murder because he was portrayed as a criminal in general\n\ndue to his other criminal activity.\n\n\n      After reviewing the entire record, this Court will be unable to find with fair\n\nassurance that the erroneous admission of other crimes, wrongs, and acts did not\n\n\n                                        - 97 -\n\fhave a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury's verdict. This Court\n\ncannot say, with fair assurance, after considering the entire record without\n\nstripping it of the erroneous admission of the extraneous matters, that the judgment\n\nwas not substantially swayed by the errors. The errors were harmful under TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 44.2(b). Petetan should be awarded a new trial free of such errors.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Nine\n\n\nThe trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence which undermined\n\ndefense counsel before the jury and created a conflict of interest which denied\n\nPetetan his right to the effective assistance of counsel (59 RR 198).\n\n\n      Outside the presence of the jury, Petetan’s lead counsel, Russ Hunt, told the\n\ncourt he had recently represented Mubarak Ali, a witness the State might call at the\n\npunishment phase of trial (52 RR 188). The trial court told second chair defense\n\ncounsel, Skip Reaves, to conduct the cross-examination of Ali if he was called as a\n\nwitness by the State (52 RR 190).\n\n\n      A hearing was held outside the presence of the jury on Petetan’s objection to\n\nthe State calling Mubarak Ali as a rebuttal witness at the punishment phase of trial\n\n(59 RR 6). Lead counsel for Petetan, Russ Hunt, stated he represented Ali for\n\nthree or four weeks on a synthetic marijuana charge while also representing\n\nPetetan on his pending capital murder charge (59 RR 7). It was urged that\n                                        - 98 -\n\fpermitting Ali’s testimony before the jury would create an actual conflict of\n\ninterest for Hunt by having a former client testify against a current client (59 RR\n\n8).\n\n\n       Specifically, it was urged that information Hunt learned from Ali could not\n\nbe used by Hunt or shared with fellow counsel in order to effectively cross-\n\nexamine Ali (59 RR 9). Hunt represented that he learned facts about Petetan from\n\nAli while he was representing Ali (59 RR 9). Allowing Ali to testify would place\n\nHunt in the position of being called as a rebuttal witness to Ali’s testimony (59 RR\n\n11).\n\n\n       Still outside the presence of the jury, Ali testified Petetan talked to him in\n\njail and told him that Hunt was his lawyer (59 RR 16). Petetan told Ali that he was\n\ncharged with murdering his wife and that Hunt had told him to act like he was\n\nmentally sick so he would not get the death penalty (59 RR 17). Petetan also told\n\nAli that Hunt had told Petetan not to use the jail phone and to act like he was\n\nmentally sick (59 RR 18, 19). Ali hired Hunt on his drug case when he was\n\nreleased from jail on bond (59 RR 19). He initially hired Hunt because Petetan had\n\nsaid he was a good lawyer (59 RR 22). He did not otherwise provide any\n\ninformation to Hunt concerning Petetan (59 RR 21-22).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 99 -\n\f      He met with Hunt once and then hired another lawyer (59 RR 19). He was\n\ndissatisfied with Hunt because Hunt was never in the office and did not return\n\nAli’s calls (59 RR 26). Hunt ultimately returned Ali’s retainer (59 RR 26). After\n\nhiring new counsel and at the urging of his new lawyer, Ali went to the District\n\nAttorney’s Office to reveal Petetan’s statements to him in jail (59 RR 24).\n\n\n      Petetan continued to express a concern that Hunt had a conflict of interest\n\nbecause he was a potential rebuttal witness to Ali’s assertion Petetan said that Hunt\n\ntold him to feign mental illness (59 RR 26). Hunt was further hampered because\n\nhe could not reveal any confidential information learned from Ali while\n\nrepresenting him on the drug charge (59 RR 26). Petetan further complained the\n\ntestimony from Ali would undermine Hunt’s credibility before the jury with\n\nrespect to the intellectual disability defense put forth at punishment (59 RR 27-28).\n\nHunt said that at the time he was representing Ali, Ali did not know that Petetan\n\nwas charged with murdering his wife (59 RR 29).\n\n\n      The State offered to limit Ali’s testimony by not revealing that Petetan said\n\ncounsel told him to act mentally ill to avoid the death penalty (59 RR 31). Petetan\n\ncontinued to object that even with such a limitation, the jury would be left to\n\nspeculate as to who had told Petetan to feign mental illness and that defense\n\ncounsel would be a prime target of that speculation (59 RR 32). Hunt complained\n\n\n                                       - 100 -\n\fthat Ali did not know Petetan had been charged with murder at the time he\n\nallegedly made the statements to Ali in the jail (59 RR 33-34).\n\n\n      Overruling all of Petetan’s previous objections, the trial court permitted Ali\n\nto testify in the presence of the jury (59 RR 198). Ali testified he was in the\n\nMcLennan County Jail with Petetan in March of 2014 (59 RR 199). He knew\n\nPetetan by his nickname “Big Boy” (59 RR 202). Petetan told Ali that if he acted\n\nlike he was mentally sick, he would not receive the death penalty (59 RR 203).\n\nPetetan told Ali that he had a relative in Louisiana who was a bondsman and would\n\nhelp Ali get out of jail (59 RR 204). When Ali asked Petetan to call the bondsman\n\nfor him, Petetan declined by explaining his calls were recorded and he was telling\n\nthe court he was mentally sick (59 RR 205). Upon the urging of Ali, Petetan called\n\nhis mother concerning Ali’s need for a bond (59 RR 205).\n\n\n      Ali testified he was familiar with Petetan’s lawyer, Russ Hunt, through\n\nPetetan (59 RR 207-208). Ali admitted he told the State of his conversations with\n\nPetetan at the urging of the lawyer representing him on a pending drug charge (59\n\nRR 208). Those revelations came about 10 days before Ali’s testimony at\n\nPetetan’s trial (59 RR 208). Ali’s drug charge remained pending at the time of\n\nPetetan’s trial (59 RR 200). Ali was the State’s only rebuttal witness and final\n\nwitness in the punishment phase of trial (59 RR 209).\n\n\n                                       - 101 -\n\f      Ordinarily, to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a\n\ndefendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that counsel's\n\nperformance (1) was so deficient that it fell below an objective standard of\n\nreasonableness and (2) prejudiced the defense, meaning there is a reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for counsel's errors, the outcome of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different.

Hunt was precluded from\n\ncross-examining Ali with confidential information he acquired while representing\n\nAli. The jury was left with the clear impression that someone, probably counsel,\n\nhad coached Petetan on feigning mental illness in an effort to avoid the death\n\npenalty. Such occurrence placed Hunt in the untenable position of attempting to\n\nsave Petetan’s life with an intellectual disability defense while at the same time\n\ndefending himself from implications he was sponsoring false testimony. An actual\n\nconflict of interest is shown which adversely affected Hunt’s performance during\n\nthe punishment phase of trial. A sentence of death under such circumstances\n\ncannot stand under the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel. Petetan is entitled to a new punishment hearing with conflict free counsel.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Ten\n\n\nThe jury’s answer to the intellectual disability special issue is against the great\n\nweight and preponderance of the evidence.\n\n                                       - 103 -\n\f      A. The evidence relevant to Petetan’s intellectual disability.\n\n\n      Ramona Pitre is a public school teacher in Port Arthur (55 RR 21). In 1989,\n\nPetetan was in her in-school suspension program (55 RR 26). She does not believe\n\nPetetan is intellectually disabled;7 he just cannot follow rules and misbehaves (55\n\nRR 31). In twenty five years of teaching, she has never had a student with\n\nintellectual disability, mental problems, or mental illness in one of her classes (55\n\nRR 32).\n\n\n      Edward Cockrell is with the Jefferson County Juvenile Probation\n\nDepartment (55 RR 36). It was decided to pursue certification for prosecution as\n\nan adult after Petetan shot Fredrick Nico with a gun in March of 1992 (55 RR 50,\n\n51, and 55). Cockrell’s certification analysis was admitted into evidence (55 RR\n\n53, 62 RR SX 133). When Petetan was 16 years of age, an IQ test administered\n\nyielded a score of 64 on a child’s test and 74 on an adult test (55 RR 65, 62 RR SX\n\n133). The doctor administering the test described Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled (55 RR 66).\n\n\n      Records from the former Texas Youth Commission regarding Petetan were\n\nadmitted into evidence (55 RR 87, 62 RR SX 128). The records state Petetan’s\n\n\n7\n  Pitre was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nher qualification to answer, or her answer.\n                                       - 104 -\n\fdate of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR 128). Those records reflect a previous IQ\n\nscore of 61 for Petetan from the Port Arthur Independent School District when he\n\nwas admitted to TYC at the age of 15 in 1991 (62 RR SX 128). The records\n\nfurther note that on November 7, 1991, Dr. Antonio Bartonico made reference to a\n\nprevious diagnosis of possible mild intellectual disability (62 SX 128). While at\n\nthe Brownwood State School, Petetan was diagnosed with mild intellectual\n\ndisability (62 RR SX 128).\n\n\n      The juvenile certification proceedings related to Petetan were admitted into\n\nevidence and published to the jury (55 RR 82, 62 RR SX 130). The exhibit reflects\n\nPetetan’s date of birth as February 7, 1976 (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Leonard Cucolo testified that Petetan was received by the Brownwood State\n\nSchool in 1991 after his juvenile probation for burglary was revoked (55 RR 84,\n\n87). He was at the Brownwood School for four months before returning to Port\n\nArthur on juvenile parole (55 RR 93). While housed at the Brownwood School,\n\nPetetan was diagnosed as mildly intellectually disabled (55 RR 103, 62 SX 128).\n\n\n      On March 21, 1992, Fredrick Nico was at Petetan’s house in Port Arthur\n\ndrinking beer in the backyard (55 RR 124). While at Petetan’s house, Petetan\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 105 -\n\fpointed a pistol at Nico and shot him twice (55 RR 128). Nico has known Petetan\n\nfor 25 years and does not consider him to be intellectually disabled (55 RR 134).8\n\n\n      The pen packets from Petetan’s five prior felony convictions were admitted\n\ninto evidence (55 RR 217, 62 RR SX 131). He was received at the Department of\n\nCorrections when he was 17 years of age on August 27, 1993 (62 RR SX 131).\n\nPrison records reflected his IQ testing was scored at 69 with a notation he was\n\nexpelled following the eighth grade (62 RR SX 130).\n\n\n      Morris Lee was Petetan’s principal in elementary school (56 RR 44).\n\nPetetan was frequently sent to Lee’s office because he did not follow school rules\n\n(56 RR 45). According to Lee, Petetan had no mental disabilities other than being\n\nhard-headed (56 RR 51).9\n\n\n      Ophelia Ortiz is Petetan’s mother (56 RR 107). As an infant, Petetan would\n\nconstantly cry and pitch a fit (56 RR 112-113). While upset, he would break his\n\nbaby bottles (56 RR 112). His temper tantrums started as a baby and have never\n\nsubsided (56 RR 121).\n\n8\n  Nico was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nhis qualification to answer, or his answer.\n9\n  Lee was not provided with a definition of “mental disabilities” or shown to be\ncompetent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question, his\nqualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                      - 106 -\n\f      Petetan has wet the bed since childhood and still does so (56 RR 114). He\n\nwas slow as a child and his mother had to repeatedly tell him to bathe (56 RR 115).\n\nHe was unable to take care of himself as a child and unable to tie his shoes (56 RR\n\n116). As a child, he was unable to dress himself or brush his teeth (56 RR 116).\n\nHe did not follow her directions (56 RR 118).\n\n\n      She had to walk with him to school because if he went by himself, he would\n\nget lost or go the wrong way (56 RR 117). He did not do his school homework (56\n\nRR 118). She could never send him to the store because he could not remember\n\nwhat he was to purchase (56 RR 171). He never learned to make change when\n\npurchasing an item (56 RR 171).\n\n\n      After his best childhood friend, “Pee Wee,” died, his nervousness and\n\ndepression increased (56 RR 120). Petetan had no interest in television or games\n\nas a child (56 RR 122). He would simply sit on the floor or go walking without\n\nfirst telling his mother where he was going (56 RR 122). He was committed to a\n\npsychiatric hospital at age 15 before he went to the Brownwood State School (56\n\nRR 128).\n\n\n      Petetan was never able to get a driver’s license because he was unable to\n\npass the written portion of the test (56 RR 123). After he left prison, he could not\n\ntake care of himself (56 RR 124). Her daughter, Petetan’s sister, would clean and\n\n                                       - 107 -\n\fwash his clothes because he could not operate a washing machine (56 RR 124).\n\nHe was unable to figure out how to operate a cell phone (56 RR 125). He never\n\nlearned to wash dishes (56 RR 127).\n\n\n      Sabrina Mouton, Petetan’s older sister, testified that up to age two, Petetan\n\nwould cry constantly, wet himself, and not pay attention (56 RR 182). He didn’t\n\nwalk until three years old or talk until four or five years old (56 RR 184).\n\n\n      Growing up, Petetan would not play outside with his sister; he just wandered\n\naround the neighborhood aimlessly by himself (56 RR 185). He never watched\n\ntelevision or played games (56 RR 186). He was fat as a child and teased by others\n\n(56 RR 187). He never learned to ride a bicycle (56 RR 188).\n\n\n      When Petetan came home from prison, she tried to teach him how to use a\n\ncell phone and he could not learn (56 RR 193). He never learned to count money\n\n(56 RR 198). His handwriting is poor (56 RR 201). At the apartment he obtained\n\nwhile on parole, Petetan did not know how to cook for himself or clean up after\n\nhimself (56 RR 197).\n\n\n      Cathy Gauthier, Petetan’s aunt from Lake Charles, testified that Petetan\n\nlived with her for a year when he was 13 or 14 years old (56 RR 241, 244). He\n\nwas real quiet and slower than her children (56 RR 245-246). Petetan did not\n\nattend school for the year he spent with Gauthier (56 RR 251).\n                                       - 108 -\n\f        Petetan’s cousin, Caston Gauthier, visited Petetan while he was in prison (56\n\nRR 26). When Petetan told Gauthier that he wanted to be a bondsman or rapper\n\nupon release from prison, Gauthier thought Petetan did not have the intellectual\n\nability to engage in such professions (56 RR 263-264). He never thought Petetan\n\nwas intellectually disabled (56 RR 265).10\n\n\n        Kimberly Jackson is Petetan’s cousin and the daughter of Cathy Gauthier\n\n(56 RR 272). She and Petetan are the same age (56 RR 272). She remembered\n\nthat when Petetan was living with her family, he was not on her level “mind-wise”\n\nand intellectually slower than her (56 RR 272, 274).\n\n\n        Thomas Kemper is Petetan’s uncle (56 RR 276). Petetan has been\n\nintellectually slow since birth (56 RR 279). He was in special education classes in\n\nschool (56 RR 280). As a child, Petetan refused to bathe or groom himself (56 RR\n\n281).\n\n\n        Dr. Ray Coxe is a psychologist from Beaumont (56 RR 313). In 1992, he\n\nwas performing psychological examinations for the court system in Jefferson\n\nCounty in connection with whether juveniles should be certified as adults for\n\npurposes of prosecution (56 RR 315). He examined Petetan at the request of the\n\n10\n   Gauthier was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, his qualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                        - 109 -\n\fjuvenile probation department in connection with a pending attempted murder\n\ncharge in an effort to determine whether Petetan should be certified as an adult (56\n\nRR 316-317). Petetan was 16 years of age at the time of the examination (56 RR\n\n316).\n\n\n        In view of his age, Coxe administered IQ tests for both children and adults to\n\nPetetan (56 RR 318). He explained the child test goes up to age 17 while the adult\n\ntest goes down to age 16 (56 RR 318). Petetan’s full scale IQ on the child version\n\nwas 64 which places him in the lower three percentile (56 RR 322). Petetan’s full\n\nscale IQ on the adult test was 74 which places him in the lower four percent (56\n\nRR 323). Due to testing differences between the two tests, it is not unusual for the\n\nadult test to be 10 points higher than the child test (56 RR 323).\n\n\n        Coxe also administered achievement tests to Petetan (56 RR 354). The tests\n\nare scored like an IQ test (56 RR 354). Petetan scored 70 on reading, 61 on\n\nspelling, and 46 on mathematics (56 RR 354). Based on testing and evaluation in\n\n1992, Coxe believed Petetan to be mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n\n\n        Dr. Harold Scott, a psychiatrist, was previously a consultant for the Texas\n\nYouth Commission at the Brownwood State School (57 RR 40. 43). He examined\n\nPetetan at the school in 1991 when Petetan was 15 years old (57 RR 45). Scott\n\ndiagnosed Petetan with a conduct disorder and mild intellectual disability (57 RR\n\n                                        - 110 -\n\f53). Scott explained that mild intellectual disability meant an IQ score between 55\n\nand 69 (57 RR 55). The diagnosis was based in part on previous IQ testing of\n\nPetetan (57 RR 56).\n\n\n      Edmond Stewart is a former professional boxer (57 RR 92). For the last five\n\nyears, he has been a pastor at a jail ministry in the McLennan County Jail (57 RR\n\n95). Stewart met with Petetan in jail and found it hard to have a conversation with\n\nhim because his mind tends to “wander off” (57 RR 98).\n\n\n      Ellis Craig is a psychologist with 47 years of experience working in the area\n\nof adaptive behavior assessments (58 RR 7). He performed an adaptive behavior\n\nassessment of Petetan by administering a test, reviewing records, and speaking\n\nwith Petetan’s relatives (58 RR 18, 34, and 38).\n\n\n      Craig explained that adaptive behavior involves the ability to “get along” in\n\neveryday life and the ability to do things everyone else is able to do (58 RR 19).\n\nWhen conducting an assessment, he measures social skills, conceptual skills, and\n\npractical skills (58 RR 19-20). Conceptual skills include language, numbers, and\n\ntime (58 RR 20). Social skills involve interpersonal relationships, social\n\nresponsibility, gullibility, and naiveté (58 RR 22). Practical skills involve daily\n\nliving, hygiene, feeding, use of money, and the ability to follow schedules and\n\nroutines (58 RR 23). Fighting, arguing, and a lack of cooperation are more\n\n                                        - 111 -\n\fcommon among those with intellectual disability than the general population (58\n\nRR 24). The testing is conducted in such a way that the score of 100 is average and\n\na score of 70 or below would indicate significant limitations in adaptive behavior\n\n(58 RR 21).\n\n\n       Craig used the ABAS-II assessment test when seeking to determine\n\nretrospectively whether Petetan had adaptive behavior deficits in his\n\ndevelopmental period (58 RR 33-34). The test measures adaptive behavior in a\n\nnumber of areas including: communication; community use; functional academics;\n\nhome living; health; safety; leisure; self-care; self-direction; and social (58 RR 35).\n\n\n       When speaking with Petetan’s relatives, Craig sought to determine adaptive\n\nbehavior before the time Petetan went to prison at 17 years of age (58 RR 67).\n\nMost of the answers provided to his questions were examples of adaptive deficits\n\nfrom the time Petetan was a youth of 14 or 15 years old and had not yet gone to\n\nprison (58 RR 68). Craig believed Petetan was forthcoming with him during the\n\nassessment and did not intentionally attempt to underestimate his abilities (58 RR\n\n39).\n\n\n       The information gathered from Petetan’s relatives was graded for adaptive\n\ndisabilities (58 RR 40). The information from Petetan’s mother placed Petetan so\n\nlow that Craig did not consider it reliable (58 RR 40). Petetan’s brother and sister\n\n                                        - 112 -\n\franked his social skills as the best, conceptual skills the second best, and practical\n\nskills at the lowest level (58 RR 41).\n\n\n      The scoring of adaptive assessment is similar to scoring on an IQ test with\n\nthe norm in the 85 to 115 range (58 RR 42). The results of the assessment done by\n\nCraig were based on input from Petetan and his relatives and the scores were as\n\nfollows: brother 53; uncle and sister 47; Petetan 42; and Petetan’s mother 40 (58\n\nRR 40).\n\n\n      Craig summarized some of the adaptive behavior limitations he found during\n\ntesting and information supplied by informant relatives in the following manner:\n\n\n      [H]e was easily led by other people, that the basic social skills of\n      being polite and offering to help people, he simply doesn't do it. He\n      doesn't say thank you. He doesn't give gifts. He doesn't offer\n      assistance to people. And this was a uniform finding too.\n\n      He didn't engage in games. The only games we ever heard that he\n      played were with a cousin who played Hide and Seek with him, and\n      this was when he was older, too. But he simply didn't understand any\n      kind of simple kind of games that, you know, kids play.\n\n      He showed no interest in most -- what a lot of people use for leisure,\n      which is TV. I mean, he has consistently over the years never shown\n      the least bit of interest in TV.\n\n      [He has] very limited conversational skills. It's really hard to engage\n      in a conversation with him. He just won't follow the conversation.\n      You can't get a response to what you're saying.\n\n      In terms of getting along in the world, it was routinely noted that he\n      was unable to read menus. I mean, he would have to order things -- if\n                                       - 113 -\n\fhe went out to, you know, a fast food restaurant or something, he\nwould have to order by the picture, just saying what he knew it was.\n\nHe could not calculate the correct change. And you really couldn't\ndepend on him time-wise. He was irresponsible regarding time\ncommitments.\n\nAgain, in his neighborhood he could get along just fine. I mean, he\nknew how to find places. He couldn't necessarily tell you street\nnames, but he knew where things were geographically. He could make\nsimple meals for himself, and this was kind of like a little\nidiosyncratic thing about him.\n\nHe never learned to use a fork. I mean, he would sometimes use a\nspoon, but every bit of food that you gave him, he would wrap up in\nbread. That's how he ate. I mean, he made a sandwich out of\neverything. So in terms of the typical or just lack of ability, he didn't\ndo. It's fairly common for people, even with mild mental retardation,\nto have difficulties cutting their food into bite-size portions.\nSomebody may have to do that for them. I'm not sure if that was the\ncase with him, because he didn't use a knife. He just used a spoon.\n\nHe was able to take medications. He was able to swallow them. He\ndidn't resist that. And he could dress himself. He didn't necessarily\ndress himself well, but he could do the physical act.\n\nEven though he could get around the community, he was unable to\nuse a map. He relied on the ability to -- either people tell him familiar\nlocations or whatever, and he got lost fairly easily.\n\nHe did not do housekeeping. He was described as a terrible\nhousekeeper and never made his own bed, was unable to learn how to\noperate most common appliances, broke microwaves because he\ndidn't know how to use them, put the wrong things in them, had no\nconception about how to use a washer or a dryer.\n\nAnd even in the area of first aid, I mean, when asked what he would\ndo if he cut his finger, he said he would sop it up. \"Sop the blood up,\"\nthat was his response. So he didn't -- he just wasn't worried that way\n\n                                  - 114 -\n\f      where he would know to put a Band-Aid and some Bactine or\n      something on it (58 RR 43-47).\n\n      He doesn't understand jokes. I mean, it's too complex. You know, I\n      asked him, you know, \"Do people tell you things that make you\n      laugh,\" and he said, \"No.\"\n\n\n      Adaptive behavior strengths as found by Craig included:\n\n\n      He got along well with family members. He could navigate his\n      community pretty well. He could present himself in a reasonably good\n      -- I mean, you know, although his personal hygiene was not\n      particularly good, he dressed and he could blend in with the\n      neighborhood. It may be that in that environment he was not really\n      that atypical in terms of how he dressed and his personal hygiene. I\n      don't really know.\n\n      He had good social skills in general. I mean, he could make friends\n      and he could hang out with a group that he felt comfortable with (58\n      RR 97).\n\n\n      Based on the test results he obtained, Craig concluded Petetan’s adaptive\n\nlimitations far outweigh his limited skills (58 RR 47). Craig had to rely on\n\nretrospective assessments because there was no measure from when Petetan was a\n\nchild other than one report noting his adaptive limitations without concurrent\n\ntesting (58 RR 48). Based on his adaptive behavior deficits and the IQ scores he\n\nhas seen, Craig considers Petetan to be moderately intellectually disabled which is\n\nmore severe than mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 48).\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 115 -\n\f      Dr. Kevin Correia, a psychologist, examined Petetan on August 8, 2012, in\n\nconnection with an application for Social Security disability benefits (58 RR 104,\n\n63 RR DX 5). Correia administered an IQ test resulting in a full scale score of 55\n\n(58 RR 104, 63 RR DX 5). Correia diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually\n\ndisabled in view of his IQ score and adaptive behavior deficits (58 RR 104, 63 RR\n\nDX 5).\n\n\n      Joan Mayfield is a neuropsychologist (58 RR 105). While Petetan was in\n\nthe McLennan County Jail awaiting trial, she administered 16 different tests to him\n\n(58 RR 124). Multiple tests, rather than simply an IQ test, were administered to\n\ndetermine how Petetan’s whole brain was functioning across a number of different\n\nareas (58 RR 170). The tests covered areas such as IQ, intellectual ability,\n\nattention, executive functioning, academic achievement, memory, learning,\n\nlanguage, visual spatial, and motor coordination (58 RR 117). She did not perform\n\nany adaptive behavior assessment testing and relied on the testing by Dr. Craig (58\n\nRR 231). She thought Petetan gave his best effort during the testing she\n\nadministered (58 RR 186).\n\n\n      Mayfield explained that one of the components of intellectual disability is\n\nsub-average intellectual functioning as shown by a full scale IQ score of 70 or\n\nbelow, namely, two standard deviations below the mean (58 RR 129). She also\n\n\n                                       - 116 -\n\fconsidered and looked for evidence of an onset of the condition before the age of\n\n18 (58 RR 132).\n\n\n      Mayfield was provided access to various records including Petetan’s school\n\nrecords and previous psychological testing (58 RR 133). She noted Petetan was\n\nrequired to repeat both the third and sixth grades in school (58 RR 133). He was\n\nsocially promoted to the fourth grade rather than being required to repeat the third\n\ngrade for the second time (58 RR 133). He ultimately dropped out of school in the\n\nninth grade (58 RR 220).\n\n\n      Her testing of Petetan revealed global delays in intellectual ability,\n\nacademic, executive functioning, problem solving, memory, language, motor\n\nskills, and visual perception (58 RR 185). He suffers from sub-average intellectual\n\nfunctioning with an onset before the age of 18 (58 RR 185-186). Her testing\n\nrevealed a full scale IQ score of 52 (58 RR 135). The IQ testing results were\n\nconsistent with previous IQ testing results of Petetan she was provided (58 RR\n\n186, 244). Mayfield explained that different scores may be obtained on different\n\nversions of the same test (58 RR 243).\n\n\n      She explained that at the time Coxe administered the child and adult\n\nversions of an IQ test to Petetan, there was a problem in correlating the results and\n\nthose scoring on the lower end of child’s IQ test typically scored 10 to 15 points\n\n                                         - 117 -\n\fhigher on the adult version (58 RR 228). When the tests were revised, the norms\n\nfor the tests were adjusted and there is now greater reliability between the two tests\n\nso that the scores are now similar (58 RR 228). She believed Coxe found the\n\nchild’s score of 64 to be more reliable than the adult score of 74 and that is the\n\nreason he diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (58 RR 228).\n\n\n      Although she did not perform any adaptive behavior limitations assessment,\n\non cross-examination, Mayfield was asked questions concerning adaptive behavior\n\nlimitations in relation to the Briseno factors created by this Court in relation to\n\nadaptive behavior (58 RR 232). She noted that her role was not that of assessing\n\nadaption functioning because Dr. Craig had taken on that role (58 RR 233, 236).\n\nNevertheless, she assumed that facts within a hypothetical posed by the prosecutor\n\nconcerning the instant cause would show an ability to hide facts and material\n\nevidence (58 RR 236). She assumed an ability to lie about a companion would\n\nshow an ability to lie in anticipation of being arrested (58 RR 236). Although not\n\npresent for Petetan’s trial testimony, based on the prosecutor’s representations of\n\nthat testimony, she assumed the ability to respond coherently to questions (58 RR\n\n237). Based on Petetan’s criminal history, as represented by the prosecutor, he has\n\nthe ability to act alone in criminal conduct (58 RR 238). Based on the facts of the\n\ninstant offense as represented by the prosecutor, Petetan was not working under the\n\n\n\n                                        - 118 -\n\fdirections of others at the time of the offense (58 RR 238). The defense rested on\n\npunishment (58 RR 248).\n\n\n      Dorothy Stamps is a retired public school teacher from Port Arthur (59 RR\n\n45). Petetan was in her first grade class (59 RR 50). She did not believe him to be\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 50).11\n\n\n      Eddie Fowler was the principal of the middle school attended by Petetan (59\n\nRR 59). Petetan was placed in special education classes because he was a\n\ndiscipline problem (59 RR 63). Otherwise, he was an average student and not\n\nintellectually disabled (59 RR 63-64).12\n\n\n      Petetan’s school records were admitted into evidence (59 RR 69, 63 RR DX\n\n10). Those records reflect he failed two grades and was socially promoted in\n\nanother grade (59 RR 66). He withdrew from school in the eighth grade (63 RR\n\nDX 10).\n\n\n\n\n11\n   Stamps was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, her qualification to answer, or her answer.\n\n12\n   Fowler was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown\nto be competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the\nquestion, his qualification to answer, or his answer.\n\n                                        - 119 -\n\f      Mattie Howe was Petetan’s parole officer in Beaumont from May to\n\nSeptember of 2012 (59 RR 70-71). Howe does not believe Petetan is intellectually\n\ndisabled (59 RR 75).13\n\n\n      Travis Turner works for the Classification Department of TDCJ (59 RR 80).\n\nWhen Petetan was initially received at TDCJ in 1993, he scored a 69 on an IQ test\n\n(59 RR 85). He took an adaptive behavior screening test, but was never assigned\n\nto a prison unit for intellectually disabled offenders (59 RR 85-86).\n\n\n      B. The trial court’s charge on intellectual disability.\n\n\n      At the close of the punishment phase, the trial court presented a charge to the\n\njury (60 RR 5, 4 CR 1330). With respect to the issue of intellectual disability, the\n\ncourt charged the jury as follows:\n\n\n      \"You are instructed that in answering Special Issue Number 3, you\n      shall answer yes or no.\n\n      \"The Defendant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the\n      evidence that Special Issue Number 3 should be answered yes.\n\n      \"By the term 'preponderance of the evidence' is meant the greater\n      weight of the credible evidence.\n\n\n\n13\n   Howe was not provided with a definition of “intellectual disability” or shown to\nbe competent to render such an opinion. No objection was voiced to the question,\nher qualification to answer, or her answer.\n\n                                       - 120 -\n\f      \"You may not answer Special Issue Number 3 unless you agree --\n      you may not answer Special Issue Number 3 yes unless you agree\n      unanimously.\n\n      \"You may not answer Special Issue Number 3 no unless you agree\n      unanimously.\n\n      \"In deliberating on Special Issue Number 3, you shall consider all\n      evidence admitted at the guilt/innocence stage and the punishment\n      stage of this trial.\n\n      \"Mental retardation14 is a disability characterized by:\n      \"1.

Like Florida, Texas departs from those standards in several respects,\n\nincluding by disregarding a defendant’s adaptive deficits if the defendant also\n\nexhibits adaptive strengths and by giving effect to lay stereotypes of how\n\nintellectually disabled persons ought to appear or behave. Even after Hall, this\n\nCourt has relied on that nonclinical approach to uphold death sentences when\n\ndefendants concededly meet the clinical definition of intellectual disability.\n\n\n         In contrast to this Court, the vast majority of death penalty States have\n\nmade clear that clinical standards should govern the determination of the second\n\nprong of the definition of intellectual disability; just as Hall confirmed they should\n\napply at the first prong. In cases presenting facts very similar to this one, courts in\n\nthose States have held that the Eighth Amendment forecloses the death penalty.\n\n\n\n21\n  These arguments are largely taken from a petition for writ of certiorari currently\npending before the Supreme Court in Lizcano v.

These courts have\n\nexplained that the factfinder “‘must therefore look at [the defendant’s] weaknesses\n\ninstead of at his strengths.’” Van Tran, 764 F.3d at 609; see also, e.g., Sasser v.\n\nHobbs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 845 (8th Cir. 2013) (“Consistent with nationally accepted\n\nclinical definitions of mental retardation, the Arkansas standard does not ask\n\nwhether an individual has adaptive strengths to offset the individual’s adaptive\n\nlimitations.”); Holladay v.

In Thomas v. Allen,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"147406\"><a href=\"/opinion/147406/thomas-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">607</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 759 (11th Cir. 2010), the Eleventh Circuit rejected the State’s\n\nargument that an Atkins claimant’s ability to “drive cars and hold menial jobs”\n\nweighed against a finding of intellectual disability. And courts have emphasized the\n\nimportance of expert clinical judgment in evaluating an Atkins claim. See, e.g., Van\n\nTran, 764 F.3d at 605 (“The reliable and professionally vetted methods presented\n\nby … experts, from which the legal standards draw their substance, must guide the\n\ncourt’s inquiry.”); id. at 612 (“Tennessee law does not permit the state trial court\n\nto use its independent judgment to disregard uncontroverted expert analyses,\n\nconsider factors that the experts have testified are unreliable, or declare to be\n\ndispositive a factor irrelevant to the clinical definitions employed by the\n\nexperts.”). Factfinders in these States “may not disregard credible and\n\nuncontradicted expert testimony in favor of either the perceptions of lay witnesses or\n\nof the court’s own expectations of how a mentally retarded person would behave.”\n\nWhite, 885 N.E.2d at 915.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 141 -\n\f       The distinction between Texas’s approach and that of most other death-\n\npenalty States can make the difference between life and death in factually similar\n\ncases. In particular, defendants situated similarly to Petetan have succeeded on\n\nAtkins claims in other States. In White, the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion when it denied White’s Atkins claim on the basis of\n\nlay testimony and perceived strengths. 885 N.E.2d at 915-916. Both experts at trial\n\nconcluded that White met all three prongs of the clinical definition of intellectual\n\ndisability. Id. At 909-910. To rebut evidence of adaptive deficits, the State cited\n\ntestimony from White’s ex-girlfriend that he “possessed … adaptive skills\n\ninconsistent with retardation” and “was not perceived by those who knew him as\n\nhaving significant adaptive disorders.” Id. at 911. White had bought a truck, could\n\ndrive, held a job, and dated; he also had other “skills” including playing games\n\ninvolving coordination and lying to his landlord. Id. at 910, 914. On that basis, the trial\n\ncourt concluded that White did not satisfy the adaptive-functioning prong.\n\n\n       Applying clinical standards, the state Supreme Court of Ohio reversed. 885\n\nN.E.2d at 908, 915-916. The court admonished that “rejecting the uncontradicted\n\ntestimony of two qualified expert witnesses in the field of psychology” based on\n\nlay perceptions of intellectual disability is “arbitrary [and] unreasonable.” Id. at\n\n915-916. Because “[t]he mentally retarded are not necessarily devoid of all\n\nadaptive skills,” “one must focus on those adaptive skills the person lacks, not on\n                                          - 142 -\n\fthose he possesses.” Id. at 914. The court cautioned that “laymen cannot easily\n\nrecognize” intellectual disability. Id. at 915.\n\n\n       In State v. Lombardi, the Supreme Court of Missouri prohibited the\n\nexecution of an Atkins claimant after holding that he met the adaptive-\n\nfunctioning prong based on evidence of adaptive deficits, without considering his\n\nstrengths. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1618579\"><a href=\"/opinion/1618579/state-ex-rel-lyons-v-lombardi/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526-527 (Mo. 2010) (per curiam). The defendant\n\npresented evidence that he had trouble communicating and was quiet and\n\nwithdrawn. Id. And school records indicated that the defendant had repeated tenth\n\ngrade for three consecutive years. Id. at 527. Missouri’s statutory definition of\n\nadaptive behavior mirrors the previous APA standard and requires a claimant to\n\ndemonstrate deficits in at least two of ten skill areas. Id. At 526; see also\n\nGoodwin v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439724\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439724/goodwin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30-32 (Mo. 2006). Applying this standard to the\n\ndefendant’s case, the court concluded that the evidence of “deficits and limitations\n\nin two or more adaptive behaviors”— communications and functional\n\nacademics—sufficed to demonstrate the defendant’s intellectual disability regardless\n\nof any strengths in adaptive functioning. 303 S.W.3d at 527.\n\n\n       No two Atkins claimants are identical. But this Court systematically departs\n\nfrom the clinical norms that govern Atkins claims in the vast majority of other\n\nStates by giving dispositive weight to factors that have no scientific grounding. Had\n\n\n                                          - 143 -\n\fWhite or Lombardi arisen in Texas, their outcomes would almost certainly have\n\nbeen different. This Court should cease its defiance of the Supreme Court’s\n\nendorsement of the clinical standards approach to intellectual disability approved\n\nby the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall.\n\n\n      E. Petetan proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he is\n\nintellectually disabled under both the flawed Briseno approach and a clinical\n\nstandards approach as approved by the Supreme Court in Atkins and Hall.\n\n\n       There should be no dispute Petetan has “‘significantly sub average general\n\nintellectual functioning’” and meets the first clinical prong of intellectual disability.\n\nHis IQ scores have consistently fallen within the range of intellectual disability.\n\nWhen he was 15 years of age, he scored a 61 on a school administered IQ test. When he\n\nwas 16 years of age, he scored a 64 on a child’s version of an IQ test and 74 on an adult\n\nversion.28 When he arrived at prison at the age of 17 he scored 69 on a prison\n\nadministered test. Following his release from prison in 2012, he scored 55 on an IQ test\n\nadministered in connection with an application for disability benefits. Finally, before\n\ntrial, he scored 52 on an IQ test administered by Dr. Mayfield.\n\n\n\n28\n   The variance in those scores with regard to a child taking the adult version and\nproblems with norming the child and versions of the test were explained by Drs.\nCoxe and Mayfield (56 RR 357 and 58 RR 228). In any case, after administering\nboth tests, Coxe diagnosed Petetan as mildly intellectually disabled (56 RR 357).\n                                       - 144 -\n\f       The evidence of Petetan’s significant deficits in adaptive behavior is\n\noverwhelming. Achievement tests administered by Dr. Coxe in 1992 revealed deficits.\n\nDr. Craig’s testing sought to determine, retrospectively, whether Petetan suffered from\n\nadaptive behavior deficits at the ages of 14 and 15 before he went to prison at the age of\n\n17. His testing revealed significant adaptive behavior limitations far outweighing any\n\nadaptive behavior strengths. Craig was provided with a report from Petetan’s childhood\n\nnoting limitations in adaptive behavior.\n\n\n       A multitude of mental health and medical professions have diagnosed\n\nPetetan as intellectually disabled. They include Dr. Antonio Bartonico at the\n\nBrownwood School in 1991; Dr. Harold Scott at the Brownwood State School in\n\n1991; Dr. Ray Coxe in connection with juvenile certification proceedings in 1992;\n\nDr Kevin Correia in connection with an application for Social Security Disability\n\nBenefits in 2012; Dr. Ellis Craig in connection with testing performed in\n\nanticipation of the instant prosecution; and Dr. Joan Mayfield in connection with\n\ntesting performed in anticipation of the instant prosecution.29\n\n\n       Lay witnesses confirmed the experts’ diagnosis. Family members recalled\n\nPetetan’s adaptive behavior limitations from his childhood including poor hygiene;\n\n29\n   Petetan further notes that in the pretrial competency proceeding, Dr. Ollie Seay\ndiagnosed Petetan as suffering from intellectual disability (12 RR 62, 88). Petetan\nconcedes that evidence was not before the jury which answered the special issue\nconcerning intellectual disability.\n                                        - 145 -\n\fpoor school attendance and performance; inability to dress himself; inability to tie\n\nhis shoes; inability to get himself to school; inability to make purchases or count\n\nchange; a lack of interest in television or games as a child; wandering the\n\nneighborhood alone aimlessly; delayed ability to walk or talk as a child; and never\n\nlearning to ride a bicycle.\n\n\n      Tellingly, State did not call a single expert during the punishment phase to\n\nrebut Petetan’s clinical evidence of intellectual disability. Rather, it called and\n\ncross-examined a series of lay witnesses and asked them if Petetan was “mentally\n\nretarded.” None of those lay witnesses were provided with a definition of “mental\n\nretardation” or shown to be competent to render such an opinion. No objections\n\nwere voiced to the questions, their qualification to answer, or their answers.\n\n\n      On the basis of the arguments set out above, Petetan urges this Court to\n\nreject the intellectual disability approach of Briseno and adopt the clinical\n\nstandards approach of intellectual disability as embraced by the Supreme Court in\n\nAtkins and Hall. Under a clinical standards approach as advocated, Petetan would\n\nunquestionable prevail on this point of error.\n\n\n      Even if the Court is not willing to reconsider the Briseno approach, Petetan\n\nnevertheless argues he should prevail on this claim. Viewing the entirety of the\n\nevidence relative to intellectual disability in a neutral light, the jury’s rejection of\n\n                                         - 146 -\n\fthe special issue is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence and\n\nmanifestly unjust. The Court should reform the sentence to a life sentence.\n\n\n                                Point of Error Eleven\n\n\nPetetan’s intellectual disability renders him ineligible for the death penalty.\n\n\n      As demonstrated in the preceding point of error, Petetan proved by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence at trial that he is intellectually disabled. The jury‘s\n\nrejection of his assertion of intellectual disability is against the great weight and\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n      In Atkins v. Virginia, decided in 2002, the United States Supreme Court\n\ndiscerned a national consensus against the execution of “mentally retarded”\n\noffenders and declared that such offenders are categorically immune from the\n\ndeath penalty. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121158\"><a href=\"/opinion/121158/atkins-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). Hall v. Florida further addressed not simply\n\nhow to interpret IQ scores, but rather “how intellectual disability must be defined\n\nin order to implement … the holding of Atkins.” 134 S. Ct. at 1993. The record\n\nshows Petetan is intellectually disabled either under the flawed Briseno approach\n\nor a clinical standards approach as approved by the Supreme Court in Atkins and\n\nHall. Accordingly, Petetan is not eligible for the death penalty under the Eighth\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The Court should\n\nreform his death sentence to a life sentence.\n                                        - 147 -\n\f                                Point of Error Twelve\n\n\nThe trial court erred by failing to define the term “militate” within the\n\npunishment charge as requested by Petetan (4 CR 1318, 4 CR 1330, and 59\n\nRR 212).\n\n\n        Petetan objected to the trial court’s failure to define the term “militate”\n\nwithin the punishment charge.

The\n\ntrial court considered the request by Petetan for a pretrial determination by the\n\ncourt of whether Petetan suffers from intellectual disability (18 RR 4). Counsel\n\nnoted the absence of legislation in Texas addressing the issue and conflicting case\n\nlaw on the subject in Texas (18 RR 5). As noted in the motion, most states which\n\nhave enacted legislation in response to Atkins allow for a pretrial determination of\n\nintellectual disability (18 RR 5, 4 CR 1228). Noting the procedural difficulty of\n\nthe request, the lack of a clear statute, and that he could go either way, the trial\n\ncourt denied Petetan’s request for a pretrial intellectual disability determination by\n\nthe court (18 RR 7-8, 12).\n\n\n      This Court recently considered a complaint by the State regarding a trial\n\ncourt’s intent to determine an Atkins assertion pretrial in a hearing before the trial\n\ncourt.

Id. at 51.\n\n\n      Lamenting the absence of a statutory scheme addressing the procedure\n\nchallenged in Allen, the Court noted:\n\n\n      While we withhold normative judgment, the need for a statutory\n      scheme on this score is readily apparent, and its continued absence\n      portends serious consequences for our criminal-justice system.\n      Without a unified procedure, intellectual-disability\n      determinations may vary from county to county, court to court,\n      and case to case. As the present cases and authorities cited in this\n      opinion illustrate, some judges may prefer to address the issues\n      pretrial, others by submission of a special issue to the jury. The\n      gravity of defendants' intellectual-disability claims are too\n      weighty to be subject to such disparity. . . . We now make explicit\n      what we before expressed only tacitly: Legislation is required. Id. at\n      54. (Emphasis added).\n\n\n      The disparity recognized by a majority of this Court in Allen is the basis for\n\nPetetan’s assertion of a denial of equal protection of the law. He should not have\n\nbeen denied a pretrial Atkins determination by the trial court simply because his\n\ncase was prosecuted in McLennan County rather than Dallas County. There is a no\n\nrational relationship between the disparity of treatment between equally situated\n\ndefendants asserting a pretrial intellectual disability claims and some legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose. The disparity in treatment denied Petetan equal treatment\n\nunder the law and due process of law. The conviction should be reversed and\n\n\n                                        - 161 -\n\fremanded to the trial court for a pretrial intellectual disability determination before\n\nthe court.\n\n\n                           Point of Error Twenty-Eight\n\n\nThe judgment should be modified to properly reflect Petetan was convicted of\n\na capital felony offense rather than a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\n\n      This point of error seeks modification of Petetan’s judgment because it\n\nerroneously states he was convicted of a first degree felony offense (4 CR 1343).\n\nPetetan was convicted of a capital felony and punishment was assessed at death.\n\nSee TEX.
