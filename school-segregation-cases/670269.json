Lenhart, proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, appeals from the United\n\nStates District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania‟s December 2012 order\n\fdismissing his amended complaint. We will summarily affirm the District Court‟s order\n\nbecause this appeal does not present a substantial question. See 3d Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n                                               I.\n\n      Lenhart filed his original complaint in March 2011. Lenhart named as defendants the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania; John Walton, Warden of Westmoreland County Prison;\n\nNaphcare, Inc., the healthcare provider for Westmoreland County Prison; and the\n\nWestmoreland County Clerk of Court. Lenhart sought damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\ndue to constitutional violations surrounding his arrests, pre-trial detention in Westmoreland\n\nCounty Prison, and prosecutions. In March 2012, the District Court granted Defendants‟\n\nmotions to dismiss and dismissed the complaint with prejudice except as to John Walton in his\n\nindividual and official capacity, the Westmoreland County Clerk of Court, and Naphcare, Inc.\n\n      Lenhart filed an amended complaint, which is the subject of the present proceeding, in\n\nMay 2012. Lenhart named as defendants the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Westmoreland\n\nCounty, Westmoreland County Prison, and Naphcare, Inc. Lenhart raised a similar set of\n\nclaims as in his original complaint. Specifically, Lenhart claimed that while detained in\n\nWestmoreland County Prison, Naphcare, Inc. provided him with insufficient medical care that\n\nscarred him, caused him physical pain, and caused a risk of infection to his fellow detainees.\n\nLenhart also claimed that he was arrested without probable cause, maliciously prosecuted, and\n\nverbally harassed by a jailhouse informant.         Defendants moved to dismiss the amended\n\ncomplaint pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the\n\nMagistrate Judge recommended that the complaint be dismissed, and in December 2012 the\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\fDistrict Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice1 and adopted the Magistrate Judge‟s\n\nreport and recommendation.\n\n                                                II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review de novo the dismissal of\n\na complaint under either Rule 12(b)(1) or (6). Common Cause of Pa. v. Pennsylvania, 558\n\nF.3d 249, 257 (3d Cir. 2009); McGovern v. City of Philadelphia, 554 F.3d 114, 115 (3d Cir.\n\n2009). In reviewing an order granting a motion under Rule 12(b)(1), we must determine\n\nwhether the allegations in the complaint, taken as true, allege facts sufficient to invoke the\n\nDistrict Court‟s jurisdiction. Common Cause, 558 F.3d at 257. A complaint can survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss if the complaint contains “sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to „state\n\na claim to relief that is plausible on its face.‟” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 663 (2009)\n\n(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007)). We may affirm the District\n\nCourt for any reason supported by the record. United States v. Agnew, 407 F.3d 193, 196 (3d\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                               III.\n\n       The District Court properly determined that sovereign immunity shielded the\n\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania from suit and granted its Rule 12(b)(1) motion. As the\n\nDistrict Court noted, pursuant to the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution,\n\nPennsylvania is immune from suits brought in federal court unless Pennsylvania consents to\n\nsuit or the United States Congress properly abrogates immunity. See Pennhurst State Sch. &\n\n1\n  The complaint was dismissed without prejudice as to Lenhart‟s ability to file a new complaint\nunder § 1983 asserting a Sixth Amendment violation if his conviction is overturned or\ninvalidated.\n                                                3\n\fHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 98-100 (1984). In this case, Pennsylvania did not consent to\n\nsuit nor did Congress abrogate its sovereign immunity. See id. at 99.\n\n       Lenhart argues that the District Court overlooked his claim under Title II of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) in his complaint. Although, as Lenhart states, Title\n\nII of the ADA properly abrogates sovereign immunity, see United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S.\n\n151, 159 (2006), Lenhart‟s bare invocation of the ADA is insufficient to state a prima facie\n\nclaim under Article II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, 12132; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663.\n\nConsequently, dismissal of the claims against Pennsylvania under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction was correct.\n\n       The District Court properly dismissed all claims against Westmoreland County under\n\nRule 12(b)(6). First, we agree with the District Court that to the extent that Lenhart raised state\n\nlaw tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel, slander, false arrest, and\n\nmalicious prosecution, the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act shields\n\nWestmoreland County from suit. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 8501, 8541. Second, we agree\n\nwith the District Court that Lenhart‟s claims premised on actions that occurred more than two\n\nyears prior to the filing of his complaint on March 9, 2011, are statutorily barred. See Chardon\n\nv. Soto, 462 U.S. 650, 657 (1983); see also 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5524(1). Third, we also agree\n\nwith the District Court that as to any claims that are not statutorily barred, Lenhart failed to\n\nstate a claim against Westmoreland County because he did not allege that the constitutional\n\nviolations that he complained of stemmed from an official policy or custom of the county. See\n\nMonell v. Dep‟t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f       The District Court properly dismissed all claims against Westmoreland County Prison\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6). A local governmental agency may be a “person” for purposes of § 1983\n\nliability. Id. at 690. However, as the District Court noted, Westmoreland County Prison is not\n\na person capable of being sued within the meaning of § 1983. See Will v. Mich. Dep‟t of State\n\nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989); Fischer v. Cahill, 474 F.2d 991, 992 (3d Cir. 1973).\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly dismissed all claims against Naphcare, Inc. under\n\nRule 12(b)(6). Naphcare, Inc. is not liable for constitutional violations committed by its\n\nemployees, unless Naphcare, Inc. has adopted a policy, practice, or custom that caused the\n\nalleged constitutional violations. See Monell, 436 U.S. at 690-91; Woodward v. Corr. Med.\n\nServs. of Ill., 368 F.3d 917, 927 (7th Cir. 2004). A policy or custom can only be established\n\nvia a decisionmaker through either action or inaction. See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr.\n\nFacility, 318 F.3d 575, 584 (3d Cir. 2003). Regarding Lenhart‟s claim that he was deprived of\n\ntetracycline, he alleged that the prison no longer provided him with the medicine pursuant to a\n\npolicy implemented by Westmoreland County Prison‟s Deputy Warden. We agree with the\n\nDistrict Court‟s conclusion that Naphcare, Inc. is not subject to § 1983 liability due to\n\nadherence to a policy or custom implemented by the Deputy Warden of Westmoreland County\n\nPrison. See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481-83 (1986). Thus, Lenhart failed\n\nto state a claim against Naphcare, Inc. regarding the cessation of his tetracycline prescription.\n\n       Lenhart also argued that Naphcare, Inc. provided inadequate medical care when he\n\ndeveloped an infection. In order to state a Fourteenth Amendment claim of inadequate medical\n\nattention upon which relief may be granted, a plaintiff must allege that a defendant acted with\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463\n\n                                                 5\n\fU.S. 239, 243-44 (1983); see also Natale, 318 F.3d at 581 (noting that a pretrial detainee is not\n\nentitled to Eighth Amendment protections, but nevertheless a pretrial detainee‟s claim of\n\ninadequate medical care is evaluated under the same standard as a convicted prisoner‟s Eighth\n\nAmendment claim of inadequate medical care). “[A] complaint that a physician has been\n\nnegligent in diagnosing and treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical\n\nmistreatment.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 (1976). Further, “mere disagreement as to\n\nthe proper medical treatment” does not support a claim of inadequate medical care. Monmouth\n\nCnty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d Cir. 1987). Despite Lenhart‟s\n\nrequest for a doctor, he was seen by a nurse and given two courses of antibiotic treatments. He\n\nclaimed that his care was inadequate and that he should have been segregated from other\n\ndetainees to limit the risk of infection. We agree with the District Court that whether or not\n\nLenhart was treated pursuant to a policy or custom, he merely disagrees with the care that he\n\nreceived and he did not state a claim of medical mistreatment. Thus, the District Court\n\ncorrectly dismissed all claims against Naphcare, Inc. and granted its Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       For substantially the same reasons as the District Court and because this appeal does not\n\npresent a substantial question, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. See 3d Cir.\n\nLAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f",

Halderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98-100 (1984). In this case, Pennsylvania did not consent to\n\nsuit nor did Congress abrogate its sovereign immunity. See id. at 99.\n\n       Lenhart argues that the District Court overlooked his claim under Title II of the\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) in his complaint. Although, as Lenhart states, Title\n\nII of the ADA properly abrogates sovereign immunity, see United States v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145697\"><a href=\"/opinion/145697/united-states-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (2006), Lenhart‟s bare invocation of the ADA is insufficient to state a prima facie\n\nclaim under Article II of the ADA. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131, 12132; Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 663.\n\nConsequently, dismissal of the claims against Pennsylvania under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction was correct.\n\n       The District Court properly dismissed all claims against Westmoreland County under\n\nRule 12(b)(6). First, we agree with the District Court that to the extent that Lenhart raised state\n\nlaw tort claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, libel, slander, false arrest, and\n\nmalicious prosecution, the Pennsylvania Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act shields\n\nWestmoreland County from suit. See 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. §§ 8501, 8541. Second, we agree\n\nwith the District Court that Lenhart‟s claims premised on actions that occurred more than two\n\nyears prior to the filing of his complaint on March 9, 2011, are statutorily barred. See Chardon\n\nv. Soto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110977\"><a href=\"/opinion/110977/chardon-v-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 (1983); see also 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 5524(1). Third, we also agree\n\nwith the District Court that as to any claims that are not statutorily barred, Lenhart failed to\n\nstate a claim against Westmoreland County because he did not allege that the constitutional\n\nviolations that he complained of stemmed from an official policy or custom of the county. See\n\nMonell v. Dep‟t of Soc. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1978).\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f       The District Court properly dismissed all claims against Westmoreland County Prison\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6). A local governmental agency may be a “person” for purposes of § 1983\n\nliability. Id. at 690. However, as the District Court noted, Westmoreland County Prison is not\n\na person capable of being sued within the meaning of § 1983. See Will v. Mich. Dep‟t of State\n\nPolice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112293\"><a href=\"/opinion/112293/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1989); Fischer v. Cahill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"308851\"><a href=\"/opinion/308851/joseph-fischer-v-hon-william-t-cahill-governor-of-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (3d Cir. 1973).\n\n       Finally, the District Court properly dismissed all claims against Naphcare, Inc. under\n\nRule 12(b)(6). Naphcare, Inc. is not liable for constitutional violations committed by its\n\nemployees, unless Naphcare, Inc. has adopted a policy, practice, or custom that caused the\n\nalleged constitutional violations. See Monell, 436 U.S. at 690-91; Woodward v. Corr. Med.\n\nServs. of Ill., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786257\"><a href=\"/opinion/786257/harriett-g-woodward-special-administrator-of-the-estate-of-justin-farver/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927 (7th Cir. 2004). A policy or custom can only be established\n\nvia a decisionmaker through either action or inaction. See Natale v. Camden Cnty. Corr.\n\nFacility, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780729\"><a href=\"/opinion/780729/no-01-3449/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 584 (3d Cir. 2003). Regarding Lenhart‟s claim that he was deprived of\n\ntetracycline, he alleged that the prison no longer provided him with the medicine pursuant to a\n\npolicy implemented by Westmoreland County Prison‟s Deputy Warden. We agree with the\n\nDistrict Court‟s conclusion that Naphcare, Inc. is not subject to § 1983 liability due to\n\nadherence to a policy or custom implemented by the Deputy Warden of Westmoreland County\n\nPrison. See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481-83 (1986). Thus, Lenhart failed\n\nto state a claim against Naphcare, Inc. regarding the cessation of his tetracycline prescription.\n\n       Lenhart also argued that Naphcare, Inc. provided inadequate medical care when he\n\ndeveloped an infection. In order to state a Fourteenth Amendment claim of inadequate medical\n\nattention upon which relief may be granted, a plaintiff must allege that a defendant acted with\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463\n\n                                                 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243-44 (1983); see also Natale, 318 F.3d at 581 (noting that a pretrial detainee is not\n\nentitled to Eighth Amendment protections, but nevertheless a pretrial detainee‟s claim of\n\ninadequate medical care is evaluated under the same standard as a convicted prisoner‟s Eighth\n\nAmendment claim of inadequate medical care). “[A] complaint that a physician has been\n\nnegligent in diagnosing and treating a medical condition does not state a valid claim of medical\n\nmistreatment.” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106 (1976). Further, “mere disagreement as to\n\nthe proper medical treatment” does not support a claim of inadequate medical care. Monmouth\n\nCnty. Corr. Inst. Inmates v. Lanzaro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498141\"><a href=\"/opinion/498141/monmouth-county-correctional-institutional-inmates-kevin-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (3d Cir. 1987). Despite Lenhart‟s\n\nrequest for a doctor, he was seen by a nurse and given two courses of antibiotic treatments. He\n\nclaimed that his care was inadequate and that he should have been segregated from other\n\ndetainees to limit the risk of infection. We agree with the District Court that whether or not\n\nLenhart was treated pursuant to a policy or custom, he merely disagrees with the care that he\n\nreceived and he did not state a claim of medical mistreatment. Thus, the District Court\n\ncorrectly dismissed all claims against Naphcare, Inc. and granted its Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n       For substantially the same reasons as the District Court and because this appeal does not\n\npresent a substantial question, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. See 3d Cir.\n\nLAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\f</pre>",
