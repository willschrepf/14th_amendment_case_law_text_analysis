SMITH, Circuit Judge:*\n\n\n       Kenyon International Emergency Services, Inc. (“Kenyon”), sued the vari-\nous defendants to enforce non-competition clauses (“NCCs”). The district court\ngranted summary judgment and attorney’s fees for defendants and sanctioned\nKenyon’s attorney, Dax Faubus. Kenyon appeals the fee award, which we\naffirm; we reverse the order imposing sanctions.\n\n\n                                              I.\n       Kenyon provides emergency services for governments and companies that\nhave suffered mass-casualty catastrophes. Because mass casualties are rare,\nmost of its employees are independent contractors. For example, from 2005 to\n2008, defendant Mark Malcolm worked about seventy-five full or partial days of\nintermittent disaster response for Kenyon. All individual defendants except\nGrady Bray and, for a short time, Kathy Rock were part-time and worked for\nKenyon substantially less than Malcolm did.\n       In connection with their work for Kenyon, defendants Malcolm, Rock,\nRonald Crane, Jr., and Marjorie Bray signed activation agreements containing\nNCCs. In 2009, several independent contractors left Kenyon or started to work\non their own.\n\n\n                                             II.\n       Kenyon sued eight of the independent contractors and some of their affili-\nated companies under eleven legal theories. Protracted proceedings ensued.\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f     Case: 12-20306       Document: 00512241102         Page: 3     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20306\n\n       In February 2010, the district court issued a detailed opinion denying Ken-\nyon injunctive relief. It found that “[t]he [NCC] is unenforceable because it is too\nbroad in all respects: it does not limit the area, the tasks, or the time that it pro-\nhibits its employees from competing with it.”1 On appeal, this court affirmed.2\n       In June 2010, pursuant to Texas Business and Commerce Code § 15.51(c),\nthe district court awarded the eight defendants attorney’s fees and costs\nincurred “in defending against Kenyon’s attempt to enforce a covenant not to\ncompete that was unsupported by the contract, facts, or beyond rationality in its\nbreadth.”3 In March 2011, the court awarded defendants supplemental fees in\nconnection with their defense of Kenyon’s first appeal.\n       In December 2011, the district court granted summary judgment on all\nremaining claims.4 Defendants sought post-judgment discovery based on their\ntheory that Kenyon was seeking to evade the fee award by selling its assets and\nfleeing the jurisdiction. Attached to defendants’ motion was an affidavit from\ndefendant Grady Bray that conveyed various anecdotes relating to the supposed\n“long range plan” of Kenyon to relocate to the United Kingdom, including infor-\nmation provided by a former Kenyon vice-president (“Employee A”).\n       Kenyon’s response characterized defendants’ allegations as “absurd” and\n“utterly false.” Kenyon averred that it “recently discharged two employees,\nincluding [Employee A], for performance reasons. . . .

The username of one of the chat participants was identical to the\nfirst name of Employee A. The email was not sealed when filed.\n      At a subsequent hearing, the district court engaged in an extended collo-\nquy with Kenyon’s attorney about the explicit email. Near the end of the hear-\ning, the court stated that “for having filed the irrelevantly scurrilous e-mail, Mr.\nFaubus, you will contribute $3,500 to the Center for AIDS Research . . . .” Later\nthat same day, the district court sua sponte entered an “Order on Sanctions,”\nstating in its entirety:\n\n\n      Dax Faubus must give $3,500 to:\n\n                          Center for AIDS Research\n            Baylor College of Medicine–UTHouston Medical School\n                               One Baylor Plaza\n                           Houston, TX 77030-3411\n\nThe court also entered final judgment consolidating its two previous awards of\nattorney’s fees to defendants.\n\n\n                                        III.\n      The district court awarded attorney’s fees and prejudgment interest pur-\nsuant to Texas and Business and Commerce Code § 15.51(c), which provides:\n      If the primary purpose of the agreement to which [a] covenant [not\n      to compete] is ancillary is to obligate the promisor to render per-\n      sonal services, the promisor establishes that the promisee knew at\n      the time of the execution of the agreement that the covenant did not\n\n                                         4\n\f     Case: 12-20306       Document: 00512241102         Page: 5    Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20306\n\n       contain limitations as to time, geographical area, and scope of activ-\n       ity to be restrained that were reasonable and the limitations\n       imposed a greater restraint than necessary to protect the goodwill\n       or other business interest of the promisee, and the promisee sought\n       to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary to\n       protect the goodwill or other business interest of the promisee, the\n       court may award the promisor the costs, including reasonable attor-\n       ney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by the promisor in\n       defending the action to enforce the covenant.\nKenyon contends that because an award of attorney’s fees under Section\n§ 15.51(c) is conditioned on defendants’ meeting evidentiary burdens, the district\ncourt’s ruling is akin to a summary-judgment motion, so the standard of review\nis de novo. The authorities cited by Kenyon establish merely that summary\njudgments are reviewed de novo.5 Kenyon cites no authority that the fee award\nis akin to a summary-judgment motion. We review attorney’s fees for abuse of\ndiscretion and underlying factual determinations for clear error. Mathis v.\nExxon Corp., 302 F.3d 448, 461–62 (5th Cir. 2002).\n       The NCC is contained in Section 10 of the activation agreements signed\nby Malcolm, Rock, Crane, and Marjorie Bray:\n\n       Team Member shall not actively or passively solicit for employment\n       purposes, attempt to recruit, or hire directly, through third parties\n       or for third parties any other Team Member of employee of Kenyon.\n       Nor will Team Members utilize their position with Kenyon or exper-\n       ience gained while working for Kenyon to solicit or obtain contracts\n       or work that will compete with Kenyon for a period of at least one\n       year has elapsed following effective termination of this Agreement,\n       or until a period of one year has elapsed following termination of\n       any Client contract on which Kenyon has worked in any commercial,\n       management, advisory or technical capacity, whichever is the latter,\n       without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\nAs explained, we have already affirmed the denial of injunctive relief, which was\n\n       5\n        See Olander v. Compass Bank, 363 F.3d 560, 564 (5th Cir. 2004) (citing Frank v. Xerox\nCorp., 347 F.3d 130, 135 (5th Cir. 2003)).\n\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 12-20306        Document: 00512241102     Page: 6   Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-20306\n\nbased in part on the district court’s conclusion that “[t]he [NCC] is unenforceable\nbecause it is too broad in all respects: it does not limit the area, the tasks, or the\ntime that it prohibits its employees from competing with it.”6 The subsequent\ngrant of summary judgment, which Kenyon does not appeal, reiterated that find-\ning.7 Kenyon also does not appeal the refusal to segregate costs or the award of\nattorney’s fees to defendants who did not sign activation agreements.\n      Thus, the only remaining issue is whether the district court abused its dis-\ncretion by concluding that defendants made a sufficient showing under Section\n15.51(c). Kenyon contends the court erred in imposing attorney’s fees because\n(1) “[t]here is no evidence that [Kenyon] knew the [NCCs] were unreasonable in\ntime, geography and scope at the time they were executed” and (2) Kenyon “did\nnot attempt to enforce [Defendants]’ [NCC] to a greater extent than was neces-\nsary to protect its goodwill and other business interests.”\n\n\n                                            A.\n      Kenyon avers that defendants had the burden, which they failed to carry,\nof showing that Kenyon had actual knowledge of the NCC’s unreasonableness.\nThe plain language of Section 15.51(c), however, indicates that the key determin-\nation is Kenyon’s knowledge of reasonable limits, not—as Kenyon suggests—its\nknowledge of the reasonableness of the agreement. A party seeking attorney’s\nfees is required to establish that the opposing party “knew at the time of the\nexecution of the agreement that the covenant did not contain limitations . . . that\nwere reasonable.” § 15.51(c).\n      Kenyon’s CEO, former president, and majority owner Jensen testified\nextensively regarding his understanding of the NCCs: that they were worldwide,\n\n\n      6\n          Kenyon, 2010 WL 452745, at *4.\n      7\n          Kenyon, 2011 WL 6206766, at *1.\n\n                                            6\n\f     Case: 12-20306        Document: 00512241102          Page: 7     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-20306\n\noverreaching in scope of activity, and basically indefinite in time. Because Ken-\nyon knew the NCC at issue had essentially no limitations, a fortiori it knew that\nthe clause did not contain reasonable limitations.8 As the district court put it:\n          Kenyon knew when the agreements were signed that the coven-\n       ants were unreasonable. Kenyon’s knowledge of the clause’s base-\n       less expansionism can be inferred from its breadth. The same cove-\n       nant applied to two-day workers and multi-year ones equally. That\n       it is a worldwide restriction is open and obvious. That it continues\n       as long as the client has business with Kenyon is clearly excessive.\n       Kenyon knew what it taught people, where they had worked, and\n       what they did. Kenyon knew it was imposing total, gratuitous lim-\n       its on people whom it did not equip, train, or imbue with its good-\n       will. The [NCC] is unreasonable on its face; Kenyon operated on no\n       mistaken fact.[9]\n\n       On appeal, Kenyon relies on two district-court decisions. In Safeworks,\nLLC v. Max Access, Inc., No. H-08-2860, 2009 WL 959969, at *7 (S.D. Tex.\nApr. 8, 2009), the court denied attorney’s fees on summary judgment because\n“there is no evidence SafeWorks representatives actually knew that the relevant\nnon-solicitation provisions were unreasonable under Texas law.” Relying on\nSafeworks, the court in Rimkus Consulting Group, Inc. v. Cammarata, 688 F.\nSupp. 2d 598, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010), also denied summary judgment:\n       Evidence that [an employer] knew about [an employee’s] responsi-\n       bilities and location is insufficient to establish that [the employer]\n       knew that the noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions of the\n       Agreement contained unreasonable provisions. Although Texas case\n       law on noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions was clear in\n       1996, there is no evidence that [the employer] knew that the rele-\n       vant provisions of [the employee’s] Employment Agreement were\n       unreasonable under Texas law.\n\n       8\n         In its reply brief, Kenyon maintains for the first time that Jensen’s testimony is not\nattributable to Kenyon. That contention is waived. United States v. Brown, 305 F.3d 304, 307\nn.4 (5th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (“This Court will not consider a claim raised for the first time\nin a reply brief.”).\n       9\n           Kenyon, 2010 WL 2303328, at *1.\n\n                                               7\n\f     Case: 12-20306         Document: 00512241102       Page: 8    Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20306\n\nThe procedural posture of Safeworks and Rimkus makes them easily distinguish-\nable: In both, the district court was faced with a motion for summary judgment.\nHere, we are reviewing an award of attorney’s fees for abuse of discretion.\n       Assuming without deciding that Safeworks’s “actual knowledge” require-\nment is an accurate statement of Texas law, it follows that Kenyon’s knowledge\nof the NCC’s overbreadth cannot be inferred merely from its text.10 Even so, the\nfactual findings underlying the fee award were not clearly erroneous. In his\ndeposition, Jensen expressed an understanding of the NCCs as “worldwide”\n“until [the district court] told us otherwise”; Jensen indicated that the NCC was\nintended to keep Kenyon’s contractors from working for a competitor in any\ncapacity, even if they had not performed the same function for Kenyon; and Jen-\nsen agreed with a characterization that the NCC was intended to “run indefi-\nnitely.” Based on that testimony, the district court’s conclusion that “Kenyon\nknew when the agreements were signed that the covenants were unreasonable”\nis “plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole . . . . ”11\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         Contra id. Although we apply it here only arguendo, we note that the “actual knowl-\nedge” standard urged by Kenyon would render the attorney’s fees provision of Section 5.51(c)\nessentially toothless. Parties could evade the consequences of unreasonably restraining trade\nso long as they refrained from acquiring actual knowledge of what is in their contracts or\nremained ignorant of longstanding Texas law. See Wackenhut, 793 S.W.2d at 684 (noting that\nthe subchapter governing covenants not to compete was enacted in 1989). As Jensen’s testi-\nmony demonstrates, it is unlikely that an employee could ever show that an employerSSeven\na sophisticated oneSShad contemporaneous actual knowledge that an NCC did not contain rea-\nsonable limitations:\n\n       [Lawyer for Defendants]: What did you do . . . to convince yourself that the\n       [NCC] . . . would be enforceable?\n\n       [Jensen]: I hired and paid a bar-certified counsel in Texas to do the work, and\n       I assume the work he did was within the confines of the law.\n       11\n            Bertucci Contracting Corp. v. M/V ANTWERPEN, 465 F.3d 254, 258 (5th Cir. 2006).\n\n                                              8\n\f     Case: 12-20306        Document: 00512241102       Page: 9     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20306\n\n                                              B.\n       To obtain attorney’s fees, defendants were required to show that Kenyon\n“sought to enforce the covenant to a greater extent than was necessary to protect\n[its] goodwill or other business interest . . . .” § 15.51(c). Kenyon does not appeal\nthe determination that the NCCs were “unreasonable and unenforceable”\nbecause they were “too broad on all three limitations: time, scope, and\ngeography.”12 Kenyon’s briefing focuses on the numerous times it suggested\nreformation.\n       In its first verified pleading, however, Kenyon sought to enforce the NCCs\n“as worded”; it follows that Kenyon sought to enforce them “to a greater extent\nthan was necessary . . . .” § 15.51(c). That Kenyon sought reformation both\nalternatively and subsequently is of no moment: The finding that “Kenyon\nattempted to enforce the non-competition clause to the greatest extent possible”13\nwas not clearly erroneous. The district court did not abuse its discretion by\nawarding attorney’s fees.\n\n\n                                              IV.\n       We next consider whether we have jurisdiction over attorney Faubus’s\nappeal of the sanctions order.14 Kenyon’s notice of appeal (“NOA”) stated it\nappealed “from the March 29, 2012 Order on Sanctions . . . and the March 29,\n2012 Final Judgment . . . rendering a take nothing judgment against Kenyon . . .\nand awarding attorney’s fees to Defendants.” The NOA was signed by Dax\nFaubus as “Attorney-in-Charge for Kenyon” and did not list Faubus as a cap-\n\n\n\n       12\n            Kenyon, 2011 WL 6206766, at *4.\n       13\n            Kenyon, 2010 WL 2303328, at *1.\n       14\n         See Martin v. Halliburton, 618 F.3d 476, 481 (5th Cir. 2010) (“We have jurisdiction\nto determine our own jurisdiction.”).\n\n                                              9\n\f    Case: 12-20306       Document: 00512241102          Page: 10     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20306\n\ntioned party. Faubus initially filed two appellate briefs: one on behalf of Kenyon\nchallenging the fees and one on his own behalf attacking the sanctions. Faubus\nsubsequently filed an opposed motion to submit a single, amended brief address-\ning both fees and sanctions. The amended brief was accepted for filing, and the\nissue of whether Faubus is an appellant was carried with the case.\n       “An appeal must not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the\n[NOA], or for failure to name a party whose intent to appeal is otherwise clear\nfrom the notice.” FED. R. APP. P. 3(c)(4). Because Faubus, not Kenyon, was the\nsubject of sanctions, Faubus’s intent to appeal the sanctions order is clear from\nthe NOA he submitted on behalf of Kenyon.15\n       “We consider not only the notice, but also the appellant’s brief, in deter-\nmining the fairly inferred scope of the appeal.” Williams v. Henagan, 595 F.3d\n610, 616 (5th Cir. 2010) (per curiam). Both the NOA and Kenyon’s amended\nbrief address the sanctions order. We have jurisdiction to entertain Faubus’s\nappeal, and we treat Kenyon’s amended appellate brief as filed on behalf of\nKenyon and Faubus.16\n\n\n                                             V.\n       The district court’s written order does not specify the basis for sanctions,\nalthough its oral statement indicates they were imposed for Faubus’s “having\nfiled the irrelevantly scurrilous e-mail” that graphically documented\nEmployee A’s sexual practices.\n       There are three possibilities. First, Federal Rule of Civil Proce-\n\n\n       15\n          See Garcia v. Wash, 20 F.3d 608, 609–10 (5th Cir. 1994) (per curiam) (finding juris-\ndiction to entertain an appeal from sanctions imposed on an attorney even though “he was not\nformally named as a party in any of the notices of appeal”).\n       16\n          See FED. R. APP. P. 3(b)(1) (“When two or more parties are entitled to appeal from a\ndistrict-court judgment or order, and their interests make joinder practicable, they may file\na joint [NOA]. They may then proceed on appeal as a single appellant.”).\n\n                                             10\n\f    Case: 12-20306          Document: 00512241102          Page: 11     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-20306\n\n       dure 11 permits a court to sanction an attorney for a pleading or\n       other document that (among other potential transgressions) is pre-\n       sented for an improper purpose or makes factual representations\n       that are without reasonable evidentiary support. See FED. R. CIV.\n       P. 11(b)(1) and (3), (c). Second, under 28 U.S.C. § 1927, an attorney\n       “who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and\n       vexatiously” may be held to account for the excess fees and other\n       costs resulting from her improper conduct. Finally, a court has the\n       inherent authority to impose sanctions . . . .\n\nJohnson v. Cherry, 422 F.3d 540, 548 (7th Cir. 2005). Section 1927 is inapposite\nhere, which leaves two candidates: Rule 11 and inherent power. We review\nsanctions imposed under both Rule 11 and the court’s inherent power for abuse\nof discretion.17\n\n\n                                                 A.\n       Assuming the sanctions were imposed pursuant to Rule 11, the district\ncourt committed reversible error by failing to issue a show-cause order.18\nAlthough the court engaged in a colloquy with Faubus about the offending filing,\nthat extended discussion falls short of satisfying Rule 11(c)(3)’s show-cause\nrequirement. Until the end of the hearing, Faubus was never put on notice that\nsanctions were at issue, nor did he have a chance to contest their imposition\norally or in writing.19 “Providing [a sanctioned party] with an opportunity to\n\n\n       17\n          Marlin v.

Corp., 939 F.2d 1281, 1292 (5th Cir. 1991).\n       Some of the defendants rely on Rule 11(c)(3)’s conditional language (“may\norder”) for the proposition that notice and an opportunity to respond are discre-\ntionary. That interpretation misreads the rule: Issuing a show-cause order is\na mandatory prerequisite to imposing monetary sanctions sua sponte.20\n\n\n                                               B.\n       Federal courts possess wide-ranging implicit authority incident to “‘The\njudicial Power.’”21 As a general matter, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nhave not displaced the inherent power to impose sanctions.22 “[T]he inherent\npower springs from the well of necessity, and sparingly so.” Natural Gas I,\n2 F.3d at 1407. We look skeptically on the imposition of sanctions sua sponte\n“without explanation as to why [a particular sanction] was necessary to accom-\nplish the court’s legitimate . . . purpose.” Natural Gas II, 86 F.3d at 468.\n       In Corley v. Rosewood Care Center, Inc., 142 F.3d 1041, 1058–59 (7th Cir.\n1998), the court addressed a similar sanction:\n       [I]f the court was relying on its inherent power to sanction a bad-\n       faith filing, it should have specifically so stated, along with delineat-\n\n       20\n         See FED.

The court also should have\n       explained why Rule 11 was inadequate to serve the court’s purposes,\n       for as the Supreme Court observed in Chambers, “when there is\n       bad-faith conduct in the course of litigation that could be adequately\n       sanctioned under the Rules, the court ordinarily should rely on the\n       Rules rather than the inherent power.” 501 U.S. at 50 . . . .\n\n       We agree that “even if Rule 11’s . . . procedural requirements [do] not\nstrictly curtail the procedures necessary for a sanction under the inherent power,\neven that type of sanction requires notice and an opportunity to respond.” Id.\nat 1059. Because Faubus was afforded neither, the sanctions order could not\nstand procedurally even if it were otherwise sound.\n\n\n                                           VI.\n       We therefore address, for abuse of discretion,23 the merits of the sanctions\norder to determine whether we remand for a show-cause proceeding or reverse\nthe order sine die. In Chambers, 501 U.S. at 51, the Court affirmed the district\ncourt’s resort to inherent power against a party whose “conduct sanctionable\nunder the Rules was intertwined within conduct that only the inherent power\ncould address.” Faubus’s filing of an “irrelevantly scurrilous e-mail,” even if\nsanctionable, was not “beyond the reach of the Rules.”24 Rather, it was well\nwithin the scope of Rule 11(b)(1), pursuant to which a district court may sanction\nan attorney for presenting a document for “any improper purpose . . . .”\n       Rule 11, therefore, provides the only plausible basis for the sanctions. “[A]\ndistrict court is not to read an ulterior motive into a document” unless “the\nimproper purpose is objectively ascertainable.” Whitehead, 332 F.3d at 805.\n\n       23\n         See Whitehead v.

Our emphasis on an objective inquiry has been\n       emphatic; we have expressly rejected any subjective inquiries into\n       the motivation behind a filing . . . .[25]\n\nIn Whitehead, for example, the sanctioned attorney attempted to execute a judg-\nment against Kmart “by seizing currency in the cash registers and vault,” with\n“media representatives and two United States Marshals” in tow.

The district court\ncharacterized Faubus’s unsealed filing of the offending document as “a vicious,\ndeliberate smear.”         Whatever might have been the negative effect on\nEmployee A’s public reputation, however, we can discern no improper purpose\nin Faubus’s zealous representation of his client.

SMITH, Circuit Judge:*\n\n\n       Kenyon International Emergency Services, Inc. (“Kenyon”), sued the vari-\nous defendants to enforce non-competition clauses (“NCCs”). The district court\ngranted summary judgment and attorney’s fees for defendants and sanctioned\nKenyon’s attorney, Dax Faubus. Kenyon appeals the fee award, which we\naffirm; we reverse the order imposing sanctions.\n\n\n                                              I.\n       Kenyon provides emergency services for governments and companies that\nhave suffered mass-casualty catastrophes. Because mass casualties are rare,\nmost of its employees are independent contractors. For example, from 2005 to\n2008, defendant Mark Malcolm worked about seventy-five full or partial days of\nintermittent disaster response for Kenyon. All individual defendants except\nGrady Bray and, for a short time, Kathy Rock were part-time and worked for\nKenyon substantially less than Malcolm did.\n       In connection with their work for Kenyon, defendants Malcolm, Rock,\nRonald Crane, Jr., and Marjorie Bray signed activation agreements containing\nNCCs. In 2009, several independent contractors left Kenyon or started to work\non their own.\n\n\n                                             II.\n       Kenyon sued eight of the independent contractors and some of their affili-\nated companies under eleven legal theories. Protracted proceedings ensued.\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\n                                              2\n\f     Case: 12-20306       Document: 00512241102         Page: 3     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20306\n\n       In February 2010, the district court issued a detailed opinion denying Ken-\nyon injunctive relief. It found that “[t]he [NCC] is unenforceable because it is too\nbroad in all respects: it does not limit the area, the tasks, or the time that it pro-\nhibits its employees from competing with it.”1 On appeal, this court affirmed.2\n       In June 2010, pursuant to Texas Business and Commerce Code § 15.51(c),\nthe district court awarded the eight defendants attorney’s fees and costs\nincurred “in defending against Kenyon’s attempt to enforce a covenant not to\ncompete that was unsupported by the contract, facts, or beyond rationality in its\nbreadth.”3 In March 2011, the court awarded defendants supplemental fees in\nconnection with their defense of Kenyon’s first appeal.\n       In December 2011, the district court granted summary judgment on all\nremaining claims.4 Defendants sought post-judgment discovery based on their\ntheory that Kenyon was seeking to evade the fee award by selling its assets and\nfleeing the jurisdiction. Attached to defendants’ motion was an affidavit from\ndefendant Grady Bray that conveyed various anecdotes relating to the supposed\n“long range plan” of Kenyon to relocate to the United Kingdom, including infor-\nmation provided by a former Kenyon vice-president (“Employee A”).\n       Kenyon’s response characterized defendants’ allegations as “absurd” and\n“utterly false.” Kenyon averred that it “recently discharged two employees,\nincluding [Employee A], for performance reasons. . . .

The authorities cited by Kenyon establish merely that summary\njudgments are reviewed de novo.5 Kenyon cites no authority that the fee award\nis akin to a summary-judgment motion.

Kenyon contends the court erred in imposing attorney’s fees because\n(1) “[t]here is no evidence that [Kenyon] knew the [NCCs] were unreasonable in\ntime, geography and scope at the time they were executed” and (2) Kenyon “did\nnot attempt to enforce [Defendants]’ [NCC] to a greater extent than was neces-\nsary to protect its goodwill and other business interests.”\n\n\n                                            A.\n      Kenyon avers that defendants had the burden, which they failed to carry,\nof showing that Kenyon had actual knowledge of the NCC’s unreasonableness.\nThe plain language of Section 15.51(c), however, indicates that the key determin-\nation is Kenyon’s knowledge of reasonable limits, not—as Kenyon suggests—its\nknowledge of the reasonableness of the agreement. A party seeking attorney’s\nfees is required to establish that the opposing party “knew at the time of the\nexecution of the agreement that the covenant did not contain limitations . . . that\nwere reasonable.” § 15.51(c).\n      Kenyon’s CEO, former president, and majority owner Jensen testified\nextensively regarding his understanding of the NCCs: that they were worldwide,\n\n\n      6\n          Kenyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">452745</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4.\n      7\n          Kenyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6206766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1.\n\n                                            6\n\f     Case: 12-20306        Document: 00512241102          Page: 7     Date Filed: 05/14/2013\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-20306\n\noverreaching in scope of activity, and basically indefinite in time. Because Ken-\nyon knew the NCC at issue had essentially no limitations, a fortiori it knew that\nthe clause did not contain reasonable limitations.8 As the district court put it:\n          Kenyon knew when the agreements were signed that the coven-\n       ants were unreasonable. Kenyon’s knowledge of the clause’s base-\n       less expansionism can be inferred from its breadth. The same cove-\n       nant applied to two-day workers and multi-year ones equally. That\n       it is a worldwide restriction is open and obvious. That it continues\n       as long as the client has business with Kenyon is clearly excessive.\n       Kenyon knew what it taught people, where they had worked, and\n       what they did. Kenyon knew it was imposing total, gratuitous lim-\n       its on people whom it did not equip, train, or imbue with its good-\n       will. The [NCC] is unreasonable on its face; Kenyon operated on no\n       mistaken fact.[9]\n\n       On appeal, Kenyon relies on two district-court decisions. In Safeworks,\nLLC v. Max Access, Inc., No. H-08-2860, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">959969</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (S.D. Tex.\nApr. 8, 2009), the court denied attorney’s fees on summary judgment because\n“there is no evidence SafeWorks representatives actually knew that the relevant\nnon-solicitation provisions were unreasonable under Texas law.” Relying on\nSafeworks, the court in Rimkus Consulting Group, Inc. v. Cammarata, 688 F.\nSupp. 2d 598, 678 (S.D. Tex. 2010), also denied summary judgment:\n       Evidence that [an employer] knew about [an employee’s] responsi-\n       bilities and location is insufficient to establish that [the employer]\n       knew that the noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions of the\n       Agreement contained unreasonable provisions. Although Texas case\n       law on noncompetition and nonsolicitation restrictions was clear in\n       1996, there is no evidence that [the employer] knew that the rele-\n       vant provisions of [the employee’s] Employment Agreement were\n       unreasonable under Texas law.\n\n       8\n         In its reply brief, Kenyon maintains for the first time that Jensen’s testimony is not\nattributable to Kenyon.

In his\ndeposition, Jensen expressed an understanding of the NCCs as “worldwide”\n“until [the district court] told us otherwise”; Jensen indicated that the NCC was\nintended to keep Kenyon’s contractors from working for a competitor in any\ncapacity, even if they had not performed the same function for Kenyon; and Jen-\nsen agreed with a characterization that the NCC was intended to “run indefi-\nnitely.” Based on that testimony, the district court’s conclusion that “Kenyon\nknew when the agreements were signed that the covenants were unreasonable”\nis “plausible in light of the record viewed as a whole . . . . ”11\n\n\n\n\n       10\n         Contra id. Although we apply it here only arguendo, we note that the “actual knowl-\nedge” standard urged by Kenyon would render the attorney’s fees provision of Section 5.51(c)\nessentially toothless. Parties could evade the consequences of unreasonably restraining trade\nso long as they refrained from acquiring actual knowledge of what is in their contracts or\nremained ignorant of longstanding Texas law. See Wackenhut, 793 S.W.2d at 684 (noting that\nthe subchapter governing covenants not to compete was enacted in 1989).

The court also should have\n       explained why Rule 11 was inadequate to serve the court’s purposes,\n       for as the Supreme Court observed in Chambers, “when there is\n       bad-faith conduct in the course of litigation that could be adequately\n       sanctioned under the Rules, the court ordinarily should rely on the\n       Rules rather than the inherent power.” 501 U.S. at 50 . . . .\n\n       We agree that “even if Rule 11’s . . . procedural requirements [do] not\nstrictly curtail the procedures necessary for a sanction under the inherent power,\neven that type of sanction requires notice and an opportunity to respond.” Id.\nat 1059. Because Faubus was afforded neither, the sanctions order could not\nstand procedurally even if it were otherwise sound.\n\n\n                                           VI.\n       We therefore address, for abuse of discretion,23 the merits of the sanctions\norder to determine whether we remand for a show-cause proceeding or reverse\nthe order sine die. In Chambers, 501 U.S. at 51, the Court affirmed the district\ncourt’s resort to inherent power against a party whose “conduct sanctionable\nunder the Rules was intertwined within conduct that only the inherent power\ncould address.” Faubus’s filing of an “irrelevantly scurrilous e-mail,” even if\nsanctionable, was not “beyond the reach of the Rules.”24 Rather, it was well\nwithin the scope of Rule 11(b)(1), pursuant to which a district court may sanction\nan attorney for presenting a document for “any improper purpose . . . .”\n       Rule 11, therefore, provides the only plausible basis for the sanctions. “[A]\ndistrict court is not to read an ulterior motive into a document” unless “the\nimproper purpose is objectively ascertainable.” Whitehead, 332 F.3d at 805.\n\n       23\n         See Whitehead v.

Id. at 800. “In\nascertaining [an improper] purpose, we implied that the sanctioned party would\nnot have acted as he did in the absence of the improper purpose.” Maxxam, 523\nF.3d at 585 (5th Cir. 2008).\n       Faubus has consistently maintained that his sole purpose in filing the\nexplicit email was to demonstrate that Employee A’s termination was for cause\nrather than part of Kenyon’s plan to flee the jurisdiction. The district court\ncharacterized Faubus’s unsealed filing of the offending document as “a vicious,\ndeliberate smear.”         Whatever might have been the negative effect on\nEmployee A’s public reputation, however, we can discern no improper purpose\nin Faubus’s zealous representation of his client.
