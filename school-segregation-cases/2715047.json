(Travelcorp), a Texas corporation, failed to pay its\r\nfranchise taxes that were due March 15, 1986.  1981 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 389, § 171.001, at\r\n1691 (Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.001, since amended).<sup> (2)</sup>  On June 16, 1986, the comptroller\r\nforfeited Travelcorp's corporate privileges.<sup> (3)</sup>  Upon forfeiture, each director or officer becomes\r\nliable for certain debts of the corporation:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>If the corporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited for the failure to file a\r\nreport or pay a tax or penalty, each director or officer of the corporation is liable\r\nfor each debt of the corporation that is created or incurred in this state after the\r\ndate on which the report, tax, or penalty is due and before the corporate privileges\r\nare revived.  The liability includes liability for any tax or penalty imposed by this\r\nchapter on the corporation that becomes due and payable after the date of the\r\nforfeiture.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.255(a) (1982).<sup> (4)</sup>  Travelcorp revived its corporate privileges on August\r\n13, 1986.<sup> (5)</sup>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDuring its existence, Travelcorp was subject to the Unemployment Compensation\r\nAct which requires an employer to pay contributions to the Texas Employment Commission's\r\nUnemployment Compensation Fund.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 5221b-5(a) (1987).  Travelcorp\r\nfailed to pay contributions due on wages paid in the first and second quarters of 1986 and the State\r\ninstituted suit to recover the delinquent contributions.      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe original defendants in the suit were Travelcorp (formerly Hoyt Tours,\r\nIncorporated, doing business as Barker Travel Services, Inc.), and Phyllis Wilburn, J. N. Fiore\r\nand Stephen E. Lewis, each of whom was an officer or director of Travelcorp.  The trial court\r\ngranted an interlocutory default judgment against Travelcorp and severed the cause of action\r\nagainst defendants Fiore and Lewis.  The State filed a motion for summary judgment against\r\nWilburn and in its motion requested that the trial court render final judgment against Travelcorp. \r\n\tIn its motion for summary judgment, the State relied upon § 171.255 of the Tax\r\nCode to contend that Wilburn was personally liable for delinquent unemployment contributions\r\nand penalties in the amount of $11,320.80.  Wilburn filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. \r\nThe trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment, rendered final judgment against\r\nTravelcorp, and denied Wilburn's cross-motion.  Wilburn appeals from the trial court's\r\njudgment.<sup> (6)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn three points of error, Wilburn asserts the trial court erred in granting the State's\r\nmotion for summary judgment because:  (1) section § 171.255 of the Tax Code does not impose\r\npersonal liability on an officer of a corporation for taxes; (2) the State failed to offer evidence that\r\nthe obligations to pay unemployment contributions were created or incurred after the date of\r\nforfeiture; and (3) there was no summary judgment evidence as to the date the tax liability was\r\ncreated or incurred to support judgment in the amount of $11,320.80.  On original submission we\r\nreversed the trial court's summary judgment against appellant.  The State has filed an amended\r\nmotion for rehearing.  In its prayer for alternate relief, the State requests that we accept its\r\nvoluntary remittitur and affirm the trial court's judgment.  Tex. R. App. P. Ann. 85(e) (Supp.\r\n1991).  We will overrule the State's motion for rehearing, accept its remittitur, modify the\r\njudgment against appellant to reflect the remittitur, and affirm the trial court's judgment as\r\nmodified.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe question on appeal is not whether the summary judgment proof raises a fact\r\nissue, but whether the summary judgment proof establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to one or more of the essential elements of the plaintiff's cause\r\nof action.  <em>Gibbs v. General Motors Corporation</em>, 450 S.W.2d 827, 828 (Tex. 1970).  The movant\r\nfor summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact\r\nand that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In deciding whether there is a disputed\r\nmaterial fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-movant will be\r\ntaken as true.  This Court must indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant and\r\nresolve any doubts in her favor.  <em>Nixon v. Mr. Property Management Co.</em>, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex. 1985).   </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>III.  DISCUSSION AND AUTHORITIES</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t</p><center><strong>A.  The Construction To Be Given a Statute</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><center>Is a Question of Law</center>\r\n\t</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn her first point of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in granting the\r\nState's motion for summary judgment on the basis of § 171.255 of the Tax Code which imposes\r\npersonal liability for debts of a corporation, because unemployment contributions are taxes,\r\n<em>Friedman v. American Surety Co. of New York</em>, 151 S.W.2d 570, 576 (Tex. 1941), and Texas law\r\nhas long recognized that \"taxes\" are not \"debts.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tSection 171.255 does not define the term \"debt.\"   Debt is defined elsewhere in the\r\nAct, but by express provision, the definition does not apply in this cause.<sup> (7)</sup>  The term is not otherwise defined in the statute.  Neither the State nor appellant has directed this Court to a case\r\nconstruing the term as used in the Act, and we have not found any such case.  Neither has the\r\nState directed us to any agency rule construing the term \"debt\" as used in § 171.255.<sup> (8)</sup>  It is then\r\nour duty to construe the meaning of \"debt\" to give effect to the legislature's intentions.  The\r\nconstruction to be given a statute is a question of law.  <em>Johnson v. City of Fort Worth</em>, 774 S.W.2d\r\n653, 656 (Tex. 1989).</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><strong></strong><strong><center>B.  The Meaning of the Term \"Debt\" Is To Be Determined By Construction</center>\r\n</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe meaning of the term \"debt\", as used in a particular statute, is to be determined\r\nby construction.<em>  Reconstruction Finance Corporation v. Gossett</em>, 111 S.W.2d 1066, 1073 (Tex.\r\n1938) (debt defined differently owing to the subject-matter of the statutes in which it has been\r\nused); <em>McNeill v. City of Waco</em>, 33 S.W. 322, 323 (Tex. 1895) (\"debt\" is used in different statutes\r\nand constitutions in senses varying from the very restricted to the very general).  \tThe term\r\n\"debt\" has been assigned both narrow and broad meanings.  For a narrow definition see <em>Stevenson\r\nv. Blake</em>, 113 S.W.2d 525, 527 (Tex. 1934)(a debt is a pecuniary obligation imposed by contract);\r\n<em>McClintock &amp; Robertson v. Cottle County</em>, 127 S.W.2d 319, 322 (Tex. Civ. App. 1939, writ\r\ndism. judgm. cor.), <em>appeal after remand aff'd</em>, Cottle County v. McClintock &amp; Robertson, 150\r\nS.W.2d 134 (Tex. Civ. App. 1941, writ dism. judgm. cor.) (a contingent liability becomes a debt\r\nonly upon the happening of the contingency) (citing 17 C.J. 1377 for the proposition that every\r\ndebt must be certain and payable); <em>and</em> 26 C.J.S. <em>Debt</em> § 1 (1956)(a debt is an obligation arising\r\nout of contract, express or implied).  A more expansive definition of \"debt\" can be found in\r\n<em>Barber v. City of East Dallas,</em> 18 S.W. 438, 439 (Tex. 1892) (in its more general sense debt\r\nmeans that which one person is bound to pay to or perform for another); <em>and </em>26 C.J.S. <em>Debt</em> §\r\n1 (1956) (term \"debt\" need not be confined to obligations for the payment of money arising out\r\nof contract and may include a variety of kinds of obligations).  Additionally, this court has treated\r\ncertain contingent liabilities as debts to be excluded from surplus for purposes of the Act.  <em>State\r\nv. Shell Oil Co.</em>, 747 S.W.2d 54, 55-57 (Tex. App. 1988, no writ); <em>State v. Sun Refining &amp;\r\nMarketing, Inc.</em>, 740 S.W.2d 552, 553-55 (Tex. App. 1987, writ denied); <em>State v. Sun Oil Co.\r\n(Delaware), </em>740 S.W.2d 556, 558 (Tex. App. 1987, no writ) (contingent liabilities based on\r\nreasonable estimates, treated as corporate debt and excluded from surplus for franchise tax\r\npurposes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWhether a tax is or may ever be a debt also depends upon the construction to be\r\ngiven in the particular instance.  A tax is not a debt in the ordinary sense of the word, because\r\ntaxes are not contractual obligations and do not bear interest unless expressly provided for by\r\nstatute.  <em>Jones v. Williams</em>, 45 S.W.2d 130, 136-37 (Tex. 1931) (discussing the American state\r\ncourt authorities followed by Supreme Court of Texas); 84 C.J.S. <em>Taxation</em> § 1 (1954). \r\nNevertheless, a tax is considered a liability or obligation, and may be a debt under a particular\r\nstatute, or in the enlarged sense of the word debt, which embraces any kind of just demand. \r\n<em>Highland Park Indep. School Dist. v. Republic Ins. Co.</em>, 162 S.W.2d 1056, 1063 (Tex. Civ. App.\r\n1942), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 171 S.W.2d 342 (1943); 84 C.J.S. <em>Taxation</em> § 1 (1954).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant urges us to adopt a restricted meaning for the term \"debt.\"   We begin\r\nby applying the rules set forth in the Code Construction Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.001\r\n<em>et seq</em>. (1988 &amp; Supp. 1991)<sup> (9)</sup>, and other rules applicable to statutory construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>  </p><center><strong>C.  Applicable Rules in Aid of Construction of Statutes</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe construction to be given a statute depends upon the legislative intent, which\r\nis to be determined from the language used and the purpose in enacting the law.  <em>Ross Amigos Oil\r\nCo. v. State</em>, 138 S.W.2d 798, 800 (Tex. 1940).  A court must look to the entire Act in\r\ndetermining the legislature's intent with respect to a specific provision.  <em>Taylor v. Firemen's &amp;\r\nPolicemen's Civil Services</em>, 616 S.W.2d 187, 190 (Tex. 1981).  The Code Construction Act\r\nprovides certain basic rules in aid of construction of statutes:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>In construing a statute, whether or not the statute is considered ambiguous on its\r\nface, a court may consider among other matters the</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(1)\tobject sought to be attained;</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(2)\tcircumstances under which the statute was enacted;</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(3)\tlegislative history;</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(4)\tcommon law or former statutory provisions, including laws on the\r\nsame or similar subjects;</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(5)\tconsequences of a particular construction;</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(6)\tadministrative construction of the statute; and</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>\t(7)\ttitle (caption), preamble, and emergency provision.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.023 (1988).  This Court also presumes the entire statute is intended\r\nto be effective and that public interest is favored over any private interest.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann.\r\n§ 311.021(1),(5) (1988).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tGenerally, statutes imposing a corporate franchise tax are to be liberally construed\r\nso as to effectuate the purpose of their enactment as revenue statutes.  <em>Isbel v. Gulf Union Oil Co.</em>,\r\n209 S.W.2d 762, 764 (Tex. 1948).  <em>See also</em> <em>Calvert v. Texas Pipe Line Company</em>, 517 S.W.2d\r\n777, 781 (Tex. 1974) (stricter construction given in favor of taxpayer <em>if</em> doubt about statute's\r\napplication remains after dominant rules of construction have been applied).  However, statutes\r\nmaking directors and officers liable for corporate debts must be strictly construed and cannot be\r\nextended beyond the clear meaning of their language.  <em>Schwab v. Schlumberger,</em> 198 S.W.2d 79,\r\n81 (Tex. 1946) (interpreting Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7091, a predecessor to § 171.255). \r\nAdditionally, because § 171.255 is penal in nature, it must be strictly construed to protect those\r\nindividuals against whom liability is sought.  <em>Rogers v. Adler</em>, 696 S.W.2d 674, 677 (Tex. App.\r\n1985, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  When construing a statute, the court must read words according to their\r\nordinary meaning unless a contrary intent is apparent from the context.  <em>Taylor</em>, 616 S.W.2d at\r\n189.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe have reviewed the text of the current Act as well as the title, preamble and\r\nemergency provisions of predecessor versions of the Act.  We are also guided by those court\r\ndecisions enunciating the purposes of the Act and § 171.255 in determining the legislature's intent\r\nand the construction to be given the statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe original Act provided for a franchise tax to be paid by private, domestic and\r\nforeign corporations for the privilege of doing business within the State of Texas.  It provided\r\npenalties for failure to make prompt payment of such taxes and imposed liability on officers and\r\ndirectors for debts knowingly and consensually created or incurred after forfeiture of the\r\ncorporation's right to do business.  The original Act also prohibited officers and stockholders of\r\nthe defaulting corporation from doing business in or under the corporate name.  This provision\r\nhas not survived.  <em>See</em> Franchise Tax Act, 1907 Tex. Gen. Laws, 1st C.S., ch. 23, §§  1, 2, 3,\r\n8 &amp; 12 at 502-04, 505, 507 (since amended, codified, repealed and now recodified at Tex. Tax\r\nCode Ann. §§  171.001, 171.255, &amp; 171.362, §§ 171.001 and 171.362 since amended).<sup> (10)</sup>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tSection 8 of the original Act made corporate officers liable for corporate debts\r\nknowingly and consensually created or incurred after forfeiture of corporate privileges and before\r\nrevival of the right to do business.  Some version of this provision has been embodied in every\r\nsubsequent codification of the Franchise Tax Act, down to the current § 171.255. </p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>D.  Purposes of the Act</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe franchise tax is a tax on the privilege of transacting business within Texas. \r\nSunoco Terminals, Inc. v. Bullock, 756 S.W.2d 418, 420 (Tex. App. 1988, no writ).  The clear\r\npurpose of the law is to levy a franchise tax on each and every corporation that is chartered in the\r\nstate.  The inescapable conclusion is that this statute was enacted solely for the purpose of raising\r\nrevenue.  The penalties imposed for failure to pay the franchise tax are heavy, and were evidently\r\nprovided to hasten payment and to inflict punishment on delinquent corporations.  <em>Ross Amigos</em>,\r\n138 S.W.2d at 800.  Although business transacted during the time of such forfeiture is not void,\r\ncertain rights or privileges are taken away:  the corporation is denied the right to sue or defend\r\nin state court and the directors and officers are deprived of the corporate shield against personal\r\nliability for certain corporate debts.  <em>Id.</em>; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 171.252, 171.255 (1982).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe supreme court has commented on the purpose of the predecessor to § 171.255,\r\n\"The statute was meant to prevent wrongful acts of culpable officers of a corporation, and was\r\nfor the protection of the public and particularly those dealing with the corporation.\"  <em>Schwab</em>, 198\r\nS.W.2d at 81.  Travelcorp continued to employ people after forfeiting its corporate privileges; it\r\ncontinued to incur liability for contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.  Tex.\r\nRev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 5221b-5(a) (1987).  We believe that the legislative purpose of the section\r\nwould not be furthered by a definition of the term debt that excluded the officers and directors'\r\nliability for unpaid obligations to the Texas Employment Commission.  We do not violate the clear\r\nimport of § 171.255's language to construe \"debt\" to include liability for unemployment\r\ncontributions.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argues that a strict construction requires us to hold that the term \"debt\"\r\ndoes not include the unemployment contributions at issue here.  Section 171.255 specifically states\r\nthat in the event of forfeiture, each director and officer's liability includes liability for franchise\r\ntaxes imposed by this chapter.  Appellant argues that by this specific inclusion of franchise taxes\r\nthe legislature impliedly intended to exclude directors and officers' liability for all other taxes,\r\nsuch as unemployment contributions.  We disagree.  Section 311.005(13) of the Code\r\nConstruction Act provides that \"includes\" is a term of enlargement and not a term of limitation\r\nor exclusive enumeration.  Use of the term \"includes\" does not create a presumption that unlisted\r\nitems are excluded.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.005(13) (Supp. 1992).  If anything, this\r\ninclusion of liability for franchise taxes supports our view that the legislative goals of raising\r\nrevenue through the prompt payment of franchise taxes and protecting the public and those dealing\r\nwith the corporation require the construction we have given the term \"debt\" when the forfeiture\r\nof corporate privileges is imposed as a penalty for failure to pay franchise taxes.  We hold that\r\nas used in § 171.255, the term \"debt\" was intended to encompass the obligation to pay\r\ncontributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.  Appellant's first point is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>IV.  REMAINING POINTS OF ERROR</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p><center><strong>A.  Preservation of Error</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant has combined her argument and authorities under  her two remaining\r\npoints of error.  In her second point of error appellant argues the trial court erred in granting the\r\nState's motion for summary judgment because the State failed to offer proof that the obligations\r\nto pay unemployment contributions were <em>created or incurred</em> after the date of forfeiture.<sup> (11)</sup>  The\r\ndate of forfeiture, however, is not the critical date because personal liability for corporate debts\r\nattaches for debts created or incurred <em>after</em> the date the franchise taxes were due but <em>before</em>\r\ncorporate privileges are revived.  Upon forfeiture of Travelcorp's privileges, the directors and\r\nofficers became personally liable for debts created or incurred after March 15, 1986, the franchise\r\ntax due date.  We will treat appellant's point as an attack on the State's failure to offer evidence\r\nthat the obligation to pay unemployment taxes was created or incurred after the date the franchise\r\ntaxes were due.  <em>See O'Neil v. Mack Trucks, Inc.,</em> 542 S.W.2d 112, 114 (Tex. 1976) (rule of\r\nliberal construction applies to points in appellant's brief; merits of error will be passed on in light\r\nof the statement and arguments).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn her third point of error appellant asserts the trial court erred in granting the\r\nState's motion for summary judgment in the amount of $11,320.80 because there was no summary\r\njudgment evidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe State argues that appellant did not preserve error on these points because she\r\ndid not raise these arguments in her response to appellee's motion for summary judgment or in\r\nher cross-motion for summary judgment.  Tex. R. Civ. P. Ann. 166a(c) (Supp. 1991).  In her\r\ncross-motion for summary judgment appellant plead, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Section 171.255(a) Texas Tax Code, expressly imposes personal liability on\r\ncorporate officers for debt of the corporation incurred subsequent to forfeiture of\r\na corporate charter.  Further § 171.255(a) provides that the liability includes\r\nfranchise taxes or penalties imposed on the corporation that become due and\r\npayable after the date of foreclosure.  The \"debt\" for which the State of Texas\r\nseeks to hold Defendant Wilburn liable is for unemployment taxes imposed upon\r\nDefendant Travelcorp under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Statute.  As\r\nis set forth in Defendant Wilburn's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment and Brief in Support Thereof, unemployment compensation taxes do not\r\nfall within the purview of \"debt\" as recognized in Texas Law.  Further, the taxes\r\nfor which Plaintiff seeks to hold Defendant Wilburn liable are not taxes or\r\npenalties imposed under the Franchise Tax Statutes that became due and payable\r\nafter the date of Defendant Travelcorp International, Inc.'s forfeiture.  Therefore,\r\nDefendant Wilburn is not liable for the unemployment taxes imposed upon\r\nDefendant Travelcorp under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>We have already held that the unemployment contributions are a \"debt\" within the meaning of\r\n§ 171.255.  The only remaining argument appellant raised in the trial court was that she is not\r\nliable for the taxes because they are not taxes or penalties <em>imposed by the Franchise Tax Act</em> that\r\nbecome due and payable after the date of forfeiture.  In her response and cross-motion appellant\r\nfailed to raise the arguments that the obligation to pay <em>unemployment contributions </em>was not\r\n\"created or incurred after the date of forfeiture,\" or that \"there was no summary judgment\r\nevidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNevertheless, Wilburn needs no answer or response to the motion to contend on\r\nappeal that the grounds expressly presented to the trial court by the State's motion are insufficient\r\nas a matter of law to support the summary judgment.  <em>City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin\r\nAuthority,</em> 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex. 1979).  No answer or response being necessary to raise\r\na legal sufficiency challenge, it follows that the failure to raise such a challenge in her response\r\nor cross-motion does not prelude her raising it on appeal.  And this is precisely what her second\r\npoint of error does.<sup> (12)</sup>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tEven if appellant were precluded from raising these points, it would still be this\r\nCourt's duty to determine if the State is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  The\r\nState must establish its entitlement to summary judgment on the issues expressly presented to the\r\ntrial court by conclusively proving all essential elements of its cause of action as a matter of law. \r\n<em>Clear Creek</em>, 589 S.W.2d at 678.  The date the debt was created or incurred is an essential\r\nelement of the State's cause.  It was the State's burden conclusively to show that the\r\nunemployment-contributions debt was either<em> created or incurred</em> after the date the franchise taxes\r\nbecame due, March 15, 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>B.

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-5(a) (1987) (emphasis added).  The amount of contributions\r\nan employer is obligated to pay is based on the wages for employment paid during the calendar\r\nyear or portion thereof.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argues that the taxes are created or incurred and become due on each day\r\na person is employed and that she is liable, if at all, only for contributions that became due upon\r\nthe completion of each day's work after March 16, 1986.  Under appellant's interpretation, the\r\nliability for contributions would be computed on a daily basis in order to determine which taxes\r\nwere created or incurred after the date the franchise taxes were due.  This approach ignores the\r\nclear language of article 5221b-5(a), which bases liability for contributions on wages actually\r\npaid, and would create an administrative nightmare unless Travelcorp paid employee wages on\r\na daily basis.  We decline to adopt appellant's interpretation of when the debt is created or\r\nincurred.\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its amended motion for rehearing, the State argues that while the debt is created\r\nwhen wages are paid, it is incurred when contributions are due.<sup> (14)</sup>   The State essentially is arguing\r\nthat the debt is created by one event, but incurred by another.  We are aware of the distinction. \r\nHowever, for the reasons stated below, we believe the same event both \"creates\" and \"incurs\" the\r\ndebt.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAccording to the State's argument, appellant is liable for contributions based on\r\nwages paid during the first two quarters of 1986, including those contributions based on wages\r\nthat were paid before March 16, 1986, because the <em>unemployment-contributions due date</em> occurred\r\nafter that date.  To establish the contributions due date, the State directed this Court to\r\nEmployment Commission Rule 301.9, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Contributions shall accrue quarterly and shall become due on the first day of the\r\nmonth immediately following such calendar quarter.  They shall be paid to the\r\ncommission on or before the last day of such month.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Employment Comm'n, 7 Tex. Reg. 2630 (1982) (40 T.A.C. § 301.9, since amended),\r\nadopting 7 Tex. Reg. 2107 (proposed rule).  The State asserts that this rule establishes that the\r\ndue dates for the taxes are April 1 and July 1, respectively, for the first and second quarters of\r\n1986, both of which occur after the franchise tax due date.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe agency rule was not before the trial court as part of the State's summary\r\njudgment proof.  However, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13b, § 4 provides that the rules\r\nof agencies published in the Texas Administrative Code are to be judicially noticed and constitute\r\n<em>prima facie</em> evidence of the text of the documents.<sup> (15)</sup>  Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Evid. Ann. 204\r\n(Pamph. 1991), we take judicial notice of the rule and the due dates it establishes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNevertheless, we decline to hold that the debt is incurred when contributions are\r\ndue because to do so would hold officers and directors personally liable for a corporate debt that\r\nis based, at least in part, on wages paid before the date the franchise taxes were due.  For\r\nexample, while the first quarter contributions are due April 1, they are based on wages paid\r\nbetween January 1 and March 30.  If the debt were incurred when \"due,\" Wilburn would be held\r\npersonally liable for contributions that are based, in part, on wages paid before March 15, 1986. \r\nWe believe the State's construction would extend officer and director liability beyond that\r\ncontemplated by the legislature when it enacted § 171.255.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe hold that when a party relies on § 171.255 to hold an officer or director of a\r\ncorporation personally liable for unemployment-tax contributions, the debt (the obligation to pay\r\ncontributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund) is created or incurred when wages are\r\nactually paid.  The payment of wages is the event that both creates (brings into existence) and\r\nincurs (brings on or occasions) the employment-tax liability.  Absent payment of employment\r\nwages, there is no employment-tax liability.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tArticle 5221b-5(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \"contributions accrue and\r\nbecome payable by each employer for each calendar year, or portion thereof, . . . with respect\r\nto wages for employment paid <em>during</em> such calendar quarter or portion thereof.  Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. Ann. art. 5221b-5(a) (1987).  The State's exhibit \"A,\" which is a sworn statement and is\r\nattached to its motion for summary judgment, reflects \"total taxable wages\" for the first and\r\nsecond quarters.<sup> (16)</sup>  Since the total taxable wages for each quarter are presumed to include the\r\nwages for employment paid <em>during</em> that quarter, we may conclude from the State's exhibit \"A\"\r\nthat these wages were paid on payroll dates occurring during the quarter (i.e. wages are paid on\r\npayroll dates, therefore wages paid during each quarter are paid on payroll dates that occur during\r\nthe quarter).  Accordingly, appellant is liable only for contributions based on wages paid on\r\npayroll dates occurring after March 15, 1986 and before August 13, 1986, when the corporate\r\nprivileges were revived.<sup> (17)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>C.  First Quarter Contributions and Penalties</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\t</strong>The first calendar quarter commences January 1 and ends March 30.  The State's\r\nclaim for first quarter contributions and penalties is based on wages paid during the first quarter.\r\nThe State's exhibit \"A\" reflects contributions and penalties due for the first calendar quarter\r\n($7556.69).  Exhibit \"A\" does not segregate that portion of first quarter contributions and\r\npenalties due that is based on wages paid after March 15, 1986, the franchise tax due date. \r\nAppellant is liable for only that portion of first quarter contributions and penalties that is based\r\non wages paid after March 15, 1986.  Therefore, the State has not met its burden to show that it\r\nis entitled as a matter of law to that portion of the judgment against appellant that is based on its\r\nclaim for first quarter contributions and penalties, because it can not be determined from the\r\nsummary judgment proof what portion of the first quarter contributions and penalties due is based\r\non wages paid after March 15, 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>D.  Second Quarter Contributions and Penalties</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\t</strong>The second quarter of the calendar year commences on April 1 and ends June 30. \r\nTherefore, all wages paid during the second quarter were paid after March 15, 1986, the date the\r\nfranchise taxes were due, and before August 13, 1986, the date the corporate privileges were\r\nrevived.  The State's exhibit \"A\" reflects the amount of contributions and penalties due for the\r\nsecond calendar quarter.  The State has shown that its claim for the second quarter contributions\r\nand penalties is based on wages paid after March 15, 1986.  The State has established that the\r\nsecond calendar quarter portion of the debt was created or incurred after the date the franchise\r\ntaxes were due.  Furthermore, Article 5221b-12(e) provides that exhibit \"A,\" which is a sworn\r\nstatement, is <em>prima facie</em> evidence \"that the contributions, penalties or interest shown to be due\r\nby said statement, . . . are, within the knowledge of the Affiant, past due and unpaid,\" unless a\r\nsworn answer to the contrary is filed.  1957 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 460, § 14, at 1357 (Tex. Rev.\r\nCiv. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-12(e), since amended).  Appellant did not file a sworn answer.  The\r\nState has met its burden to show that it is entitled as a matter of law to that portion of the\r\njudgment against appellant that is based on second quarter contributions and penalties due in the\r\namount of $3,764.11.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>E.  Conclusion</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment and ordered that\r\nthe State recover from Wilburn the amount of $11,320.80, representing the contributions and\r\npenalties for the first and second quarters of 1986.  The judgment shows that the amount of\r\ncontributions and penalties due for the first quarter is $7,556.69.  We have determined, however,\r\nthat the State did not show it was entitled, as a matter of law, to that portion of the judgment. \r\nAccordingly, in our judgment issued on November 13, 1991, we reversed and remanded the\r\nportion of the summary judgment that awarded the State contributions and penalties totalling\r\n$11,320.80.  The State then filed a voluntary remittitur in the amount of $7,556.69.  Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. Ann. 85(e)<strong> </strong>(Pamph. 1991).  Because this Court is of the opinion that the remittitur cures\r\nthe reversible error, we accept the remittitur and modify the trial-court judgment accordingly. \r\nRule 85(e).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe judgment of the trial court in favor of the State of Texas and against Phyllis\r\nWilburn is reduced by the amount of $7,556.69 to award the State recovery in the amount of\r\n$3,764.11 against Phyllis Wilburn.

We address the second point as indicated,\r\n<em>infra.</em>\r\n</p><p>12.      <sup>12</sup>  Appellant's third point may also be construed as a legal sufficiency challenge.  In its brief,\r\nand at oral argument, the State asserted that appellant's third point of error was an attack on the\r\namount of the judgment and that she was precluded from raising this point because she had failed\r\nto file a sworn denial as required by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-12(e).  Under Article\r\n5221b-12(e), unless appellant files a sworn denial, the State's Exhibit \"A,\" which evidences the\r\nunemployment contributions debt, is taken as prima facie evidence that the debt is past due and\r\nunpaid and all just and lawful offsets, payments, and credits have been allowed. The provision\r\nfurther provides that, in the absence of a sworn denial, appellant cannot deny the claim for\r\ncontributions, penalties, or interest or any portion thereof. 1957 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 460, § 14,\r\nat 1357, (Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-12(e), since amended).   While appellant may be\r\nprecluded from attacking the amount of the judgment, she is not precluded from asserting that\r\nthere is no evidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred, because this is a\r\nchallenge to the legal sufficiency of the summary judgment proof.  \r\n</p><p>13.      <sup>13</sup> The calendar year is the period from January 1 to December 31 inclusive.  Black's Law\r\nDictionary 204 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n</p><p>14.      <sup>14</sup> As support for this argument, the State cites <em>Cowan</em> <em>Boat Transfer v. Texas Employment\r\nCom'n, </em>789 S.W.2d 405 (Tex. App. 1990,  dism. agr.).  In <em>Cowan</em>, the employment commission\r\nhad determined that contract truck drivers were in the employ of the appellant.  Consequently,\r\nCowan became an employer subject to the Unemployment Compensation Act for purposes of\r\nunemployment-tax contributions. Nevertheless, Cowan did not pay estimated unemployment-tax\r\ncontributions.  At issue was whether Cowan was obligated to pay the estimated tax contributions\r\nin the absence of a formal assessment by the commission.  <em>Cowan</em>, 789 S.W.2d at 407.  This\r\ncourt concluded that the statutory tax contributions were alleged to be due, for purposes of tax\r\nliability arising under the Act, when the Commission made its notification and ruling. \r\nConsequently, a formal assessment was not a prerequisite to Cowan's obligation to pay the tax\r\nliability.  <em>Id.</em>  <em>Cowan</em> does not stand for the proposition that the tax liability is created or incurred\r\nwhen due.  Nor does <em>Cowan </em>hold that the tax determination occurs when employment taxes are\r\nreported; the determination that Cowan was liable for contributions occurred when the\r\nCommission determined it was an employer of the truck drivers.   \r\n</p><p>15.      <sup>15</sup> Section 4 provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The codified rules of the agencies published in the Texas Administrative Code, as\r\napproved by the secretary of state and as amended by documents subsequently filed\r\nwith the office of the secretary of state, are to be judicially noticed and constitute\r\nprima facie evidence of the text of the documents and of the fact that they are in\r\neffect on and after the date of notation.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex.

It does not ignore\r\nthe administrative scheme created by the Commission, nor does it require the State to conduct an\r\naudit or maintain an action at law in order to ascertain what portion of the contributions, in a\r\nquarter where franchise taxes are due, is based on employment wages paid after the franchise tax\r\ndue date.  We believe that, under Rule 301.7(b), the Commission has the power to require an\r\nemployer to segregate that portion of wages paid for employment between January 1 and the\r\nfranchise tax due date from that portion of employment wages paid after the franchise tax due date\r\nand until the end of the first quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Furthermore, our holding is consistent with the purpose of  §171.255. <em>Schwab,</em> 198 S.W.2d at\r\n81 (statute meant to prevent wrongful acts of culpable officers of a corporation and protect the\r\npublic and those dealing with corporation).

(Travelcorp), a Texas corporation, failed to pay its\r\nfranchise taxes that were due March 15, 1986.  1981 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 389, § 171.001, at\r\n1691 (Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.001, since amended).<sup> (2)</sup>  On June 16, 1986, the comptroller\r\nforfeited Travelcorp's corporate privileges.<sup> (3)</sup>  Upon forfeiture, each director or officer becomes\r\nliable for certain debts of the corporation:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>If the corporate privileges of a corporation are forfeited for the failure to file a\r\nreport or pay a tax or penalty, each director or officer of the corporation is liable\r\nfor each debt of the corporation that is created or incurred in this state after the\r\ndate on which the report, tax, or penalty is due and before the corporate privileges\r\nare revived.  The liability includes liability for any tax or penalty imposed by this\r\nchapter on the corporation that becomes due and payable after the date of the\r\nforfeiture.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.255(a) (1982).<sup> (4)</sup>  Travelcorp revived its corporate privileges on August\r\n13, 1986.<sup> (5)</sup>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tDuring its existence, Travelcorp was subject to the Unemployment Compensation\r\nAct which requires an employer to pay contributions to the Texas Employment Commission's\r\nUnemployment Compensation Fund.  Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 5221b-5(a) (1987).  Travelcorp\r\nfailed to pay contributions due on wages paid in the first and second quarters of 1986 and the State\r\ninstituted suit to recover the delinquent contributions.      </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe original defendants in the suit were Travelcorp (formerly Hoyt Tours,\r\nIncorporated, doing business as Barker Travel Services, Inc.), and Phyllis Wilburn, J. N. Fiore\r\nand Stephen E. Lewis, each of whom was an officer or director of Travelcorp.  The trial court\r\ngranted an interlocutory default judgment against Travelcorp and severed the cause of action\r\nagainst defendants Fiore and Lewis.  The State filed a motion for summary judgment against\r\nWilburn and in its motion requested that the trial court render final judgment against Travelcorp. \r\n\tIn its motion for summary judgment, the State relied upon § 171.255 of the Tax\r\nCode to contend that Wilburn was personally liable for delinquent unemployment contributions\r\nand penalties in the amount of $11,320.80.  Wilburn filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. \r\nThe trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment, rendered final judgment against\r\nTravelcorp, and denied Wilburn's cross-motion.  Wilburn appeals from the trial court's\r\njudgment.<sup> (6)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn three points of error, Wilburn asserts the trial court erred in granting the State's\r\nmotion for summary judgment because:  (1) section § 171.255 of the Tax Code does not impose\r\npersonal liability on an officer of a corporation for taxes; (2) the State failed to offer evidence that\r\nthe obligations to pay unemployment contributions were created or incurred after the date of\r\nforfeiture; and (3) there was no summary judgment evidence as to the date the tax liability was\r\ncreated or incurred to support judgment in the amount of $11,320.80.  On original submission we\r\nreversed the trial court's summary judgment against appellant.  The State has filed an amended\r\nmotion for rehearing.  In its prayer for alternate relief, the State requests that we accept its\r\nvoluntary remittitur and affirm the trial court's judgment.  Tex. R. App. P. Ann. 85(e) (Supp.\r\n1991).  We will overrule the State's motion for rehearing, accept its remittitur, modify the\r\njudgment against appellant to reflect the remittitur, and affirm the trial court's judgment as\r\nmodified.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>II.  STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe question on appeal is not whether the summary judgment proof raises a fact\r\nissue, but whether the summary judgment proof establishes as a matter of law that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to one or more of the essential elements of the plaintiff's cause\r\nof action.  <em>Gibbs v. General Motors Corporation</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1567782\"><a href=\"/opinion/1567782/gibbs-v-general-motors-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 828 (Tex. 1970).  The movant\r\nfor summary judgment has the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact\r\nand that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In deciding whether there is a disputed\r\nmaterial fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-movant will be\r\ntaken as true.  This Court must indulge every reasonable inference in favor of the non-movant and\r\nresolve any doubts in her favor.  <em>Nixon v.

Neither the State nor appellant has directed this Court to a case\r\nconstruing the term as used in the Act, and we have not found any such case.  Neither has the\r\nState directed us to any agency rule construing the term \"debt\" as used in § 171.255.<sup> (8)</sup>  It is then\r\nour duty to construe the meaning of \"debt\" to give effect to the legislature's intentions.

It provided\r\npenalties for failure to make prompt payment of such taxes and imposed liability on officers and\r\ndirectors for debts knowingly and consensually created or incurred after forfeiture of the\r\ncorporation's right to do business.  The original Act also prohibited officers and stockholders of\r\nthe defaulting corporation from doing business in or under the corporate name.  This provision\r\nhas not survived.  <em>See</em> Franchise Tax Act, 1907 Tex. Gen. Laws, 1st C.S., ch. 23, §§  1, 2, 3,\r\n8 &amp; 12 at 502-04, 505, 507 (since amended, codified, repealed and now recodified at Tex.

App. 1988, no writ).  The clear\r\npurpose of the law is to levy a franchise tax on each and every corporation that is chartered in the\r\nstate.  The inescapable conclusion is that this statute was enacted solely for the purpose of raising\r\nrevenue.  The penalties imposed for failure to pay the franchise tax are heavy, and were evidently\r\nprovided to hasten payment and to inflict punishment on delinquent corporations.  <em>Ross Amigos</em>,\r\n138 S.W.2d at 800.  Although business transacted during the time of such forfeiture is not void,\r\ncertain rights or privileges are taken away:  the corporation is denied the right to sue or defend\r\nin state court and the directors and officers are deprived of the corporate shield against personal\r\nliability for certain corporate debts.  <em>Id.</em>; Tex. Tax Code Ann. §§ 171.252, 171.255 (1982).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe supreme court has commented on the purpose of the predecessor to § 171.255,\r\n\"The statute was meant to prevent wrongful acts of culpable officers of a corporation, and was\r\nfor the protection of the public and particularly those dealing with the corporation.\"  <em>Schwab</em>, 198\r\nS.W.2d at 81.  Travelcorp continued to employ people after forfeiting its corporate privileges; it\r\ncontinued to incur liability for contributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.  Tex.\r\nRev. Civ. Stat. Ann. § 5221b-5(a) (1987).  We believe that the legislative purpose of the section\r\nwould not be furthered by a definition of the term debt that excluded the officers and directors'\r\nliability for unpaid obligations to the Texas Employment Commission.  We do not violate the clear\r\nimport of § 171.255's language to construe \"debt\" to include liability for unemployment\r\ncontributions.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argues that a strict construction requires us to hold that the term \"debt\"\r\ndoes not include the unemployment contributions at issue here.  Section 171.255 specifically states\r\nthat in the event of forfeiture, each director and officer's liability includes liability for franchise\r\ntaxes imposed by this chapter.  Appellant argues that by this specific inclusion of franchise taxes\r\nthe legislature impliedly intended to exclude directors and officers' liability for all other taxes,\r\nsuch as unemployment contributions.  We disagree.  Section 311.005(13) of the Code\r\nConstruction Act provides that \"includes\" is a term of enlargement and not a term of limitation\r\nor exclusive enumeration.  Use of the term \"includes\" does not create a presumption that unlisted\r\nitems are excluded.  Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 311.005(13) (Supp. 1992).  If anything, this\r\ninclusion of liability for franchise taxes supports our view that the legislative goals of raising\r\nrevenue through the prompt payment of franchise taxes and protecting the public and those dealing\r\nwith the corporation require the construction we have given the term \"debt\" when the forfeiture\r\nof corporate privileges is imposed as a penalty for failure to pay franchise taxes.  We hold that\r\nas used in § 171.255, the term \"debt\" was intended to encompass the obligation to pay\r\ncontributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.  Appellant's first point is overruled.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>IV.  REMAINING POINTS OF ERROR</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p></p><center><strong>A.  Preservation of Error</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant has combined her argument and authorities under  her two remaining\r\npoints of error.  In her second point of error appellant argues the trial court erred in granting the\r\nState's motion for summary judgment because the State failed to offer proof that the obligations\r\nto pay unemployment contributions were <em>created or incurred</em> after the date of forfeiture.<sup> (11)</sup>  The\r\ndate of forfeiture, however, is not the critical date because personal liability for corporate debts\r\nattaches for debts created or incurred <em>after</em> the date the franchise taxes were due but <em>before</em>\r\ncorporate privileges are revived.  Upon forfeiture of Travelcorp's privileges, the directors and\r\nofficers became personally liable for debts created or incurred after March 15, 1986, the franchise\r\ntax due date.  We will treat appellant's point as an attack on the State's failure to offer evidence\r\nthat the obligation to pay unemployment taxes was created or incurred after the date the franchise\r\ntaxes were due.  <em>See O'Neil v. Mack Trucks, Inc.,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1761393\"><a href=\"/opinion/1761393/oneil-v-mack-trucks-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 114 (Tex. 1976) (rule of\r\nliberal construction applies to points in appellant's brief; merits of error will be passed on in light\r\nof the statement and arguments).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn her third point of error appellant asserts the trial court erred in granting the\r\nState's motion for summary judgment in the amount of $11,320.80 because there was no summary\r\njudgment evidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe State argues that appellant did not preserve error on these points because she\r\ndid not raise these arguments in her response to appellee's motion for summary judgment or in\r\nher cross-motion for summary judgment.  Tex. R. Civ. P. Ann. 166a(c) (Supp. 1991).  In her\r\ncross-motion for summary judgment appellant plead, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Section 171.255(a) Texas Tax Code, expressly imposes personal liability on\r\ncorporate officers for debt of the corporation incurred subsequent to forfeiture of\r\na corporate charter.  Further § 171.255(a) provides that the liability includes\r\nfranchise taxes or penalties imposed on the corporation that become due and\r\npayable after the date of foreclosure.  The \"debt\" for which the State of Texas\r\nseeks to hold Defendant Wilburn liable is for unemployment taxes imposed upon\r\nDefendant Travelcorp under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Statute.  As\r\nis set forth in Defendant Wilburn's Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary\r\nJudgment and Brief in Support Thereof, unemployment compensation taxes do not\r\nfall within the purview of \"debt\" as recognized in Texas Law.  Further, the taxes\r\nfor which Plaintiff seeks to hold Defendant Wilburn liable are not taxes or\r\npenalties imposed under the Franchise Tax Statutes that became due and payable\r\nafter the date of Defendant Travelcorp International, Inc.'s forfeiture.  Therefore,\r\nDefendant Wilburn is not liable for the unemployment taxes imposed upon\r\nDefendant Travelcorp under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Statute.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>We have already held that the unemployment contributions are a \"debt\" within the meaning of\r\n§ 171.255.  The only remaining argument appellant raised in the trial court was that she is not\r\nliable for the taxes because they are not taxes or penalties <em>imposed by the Franchise Tax Act</em> that\r\nbecome due and payable after the date of forfeiture.  In her response and cross-motion appellant\r\nfailed to raise the arguments that the obligation to pay <em>unemployment contributions </em>was not\r\n\"created or incurred after the date of forfeiture,\" or that \"there was no summary judgment\r\nevidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred.\"  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNevertheless, Wilburn needs no answer or response to the motion to contend on\r\nappeal that the grounds expressly presented to the trial court by the State's motion are insufficient\r\nas a matter of law to support the summary judgment.  <em>City of Houston v. Clear Creek Basin\r\nAuthority,</em> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1571353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1571353/city-of-houston-v-clear-creek-basin-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 678 (Tex. 1979).  No answer or response being necessary to raise\r\na legal sufficiency challenge, it follows that the failure to raise such a challenge in her response\r\nor cross-motion does not prelude her raising it on appeal.  And this is precisely what her second\r\npoint of error does.<sup> (12)</sup>  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tEven if appellant were precluded from raising these points, it would still be this\r\nCourt's duty to determine if the State is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.  The\r\nState must establish its entitlement to summary judgment on the issues expressly presented to the\r\ntrial court by conclusively proving all essential elements of its cause of action as a matter of law. \r\n<em>Clear Creek</em>, 589 S.W.2d at 678.  The date the debt was created or incurred is an essential\r\nelement of the State's cause.  It was the State's burden conclusively to show that the\r\nunemployment-contributions debt was either<em> created or incurred</em> after the date the franchise taxes\r\nbecame due, March 15, 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>B.  Holding</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe word \"create\" means to bring into existence something which did not exist. \r\nThe word \"incur\" is defined as brought on, occasioned, or caused.  <em>Schwab</em>, 198 S.W.2d at 81. \r\nArticle 5221b-5(a) of the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act recites, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar\r\nyear, or portion thereof, in which he is subject to this Act, with respect to<em> wages\r\nfor employment paid</em> <em>during such calendar year or portion thereof</em>.<sup>[<sup> (13)</sup>]  Such\r\ncontributions shall become due and be paid to the Commission for the fund in\r\naccordance with such rules or regulations as the Commission may prescribe.</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-5(a) (1987) (emphasis added).  The amount of contributions\r\nan employer is obligated to pay is based on the wages for employment paid during the calendar\r\nyear or portion thereof.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAppellant argues that the taxes are created or incurred and become due on each day\r\na person is employed and that she is liable, if at all, only for contributions that became due upon\r\nthe completion of each day's work after March 16, 1986.  Under appellant's interpretation, the\r\nliability for contributions would be computed on a daily basis in order to determine which taxes\r\nwere created or incurred after the date the franchise taxes were due.  This approach ignores the\r\nclear language of article 5221b-5(a), which bases liability for contributions on wages actually\r\npaid, and would create an administrative nightmare unless Travelcorp paid employee wages on\r\na daily basis.  We decline to adopt appellant's interpretation of when the debt is created or\r\nincurred.\t</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its amended motion for rehearing, the State argues that while the debt is created\r\nwhen wages are paid, it is incurred when contributions are due.<sup> (14)</sup>   The State essentially is arguing\r\nthat the debt is created by one event, but incurred by another.  We are aware of the distinction. \r\nHowever, for the reasons stated below, we believe the same event both \"creates\" and \"incurs\" the\r\ndebt.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tAccording to the State's argument, appellant is liable for contributions based on\r\nwages paid during the first two quarters of 1986, including those contributions based on wages\r\nthat were paid before March 16, 1986, because the <em>unemployment-contributions due date</em> occurred\r\nafter that date.  To establish the contributions due date, the State directed this Court to\r\nEmployment Commission Rule 301.9, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Contributions shall accrue quarterly and shall become due on the first day of the\r\nmonth immediately following such calendar quarter.  They shall be paid to the\r\ncommission on or before the last day of such month.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Employment Comm'n, 7 Tex. Reg. 2630 (1982) (40 T.A.C. § 301.9, since amended),\r\nadopting 7 Tex. Reg. 2107 (proposed rule).  The State asserts that this rule establishes that the\r\ndue dates for the taxes are April 1 and July 1, respectively, for the first and second quarters of\r\n1986, both of which occur after the franchise tax due date.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe agency rule was not before the trial court as part of the State's summary\r\njudgment proof.  However, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13b, § 4 provides that the rules\r\nof agencies published in the Texas Administrative Code are to be judicially noticed and constitute\r\n<em>prima facie</em> evidence of the text of the documents.<sup> (15)</sup>  Pursuant to Tex. R. Civ. Evid. Ann. 204\r\n(Pamph. 1991), we take judicial notice of the rule and the due dates it establishes.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tNevertheless, we decline to hold that the debt is incurred when contributions are\r\ndue because to do so would hold officers and directors personally liable for a corporate debt that\r\nis based, at least in part, on wages paid before the date the franchise taxes were due.  For\r\nexample, while the first quarter contributions are due April 1, they are based on wages paid\r\nbetween January 1 and March 30.  If the debt were incurred when \"due,\" Wilburn would be held\r\npersonally liable for contributions that are based, in part, on wages paid before March 15, 1986. \r\nWe believe the State's construction would extend officer and director liability beyond that\r\ncontemplated by the legislature when it enacted § 171.255.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tWe hold that when a party relies on § 171.255 to hold an officer or director of a\r\ncorporation personally liable for unemployment-tax contributions, the debt (the obligation to pay\r\ncontributions to the Unemployment Compensation Fund) is created or incurred when wages are\r\nactually paid.  The payment of wages is the event that both creates (brings into existence) and\r\nincurs (brings on or occasions) the employment-tax liability.  Absent payment of employment\r\nwages, there is no employment-tax liability.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tArticle 5221b-5(a) provides, in pertinent part, that \"contributions accrue and\r\nbecome payable by each employer for each calendar year, or portion thereof, . . . with respect\r\nto wages for employment paid <em>during</em> such calendar quarter or portion thereof.  Tex. Rev. Civ.\r\nStat. Ann. art. 5221b-5(a) (1987).  The State's exhibit \"A,\" which is a sworn statement and is\r\nattached to its motion for summary judgment, reflects \"total taxable wages\" for the first and\r\nsecond quarters.<sup> (16)</sup>  Since the total taxable wages for each quarter are presumed to include the\r\nwages for employment paid <em>during</em> that quarter, we may conclude from the State's exhibit \"A\"\r\nthat these wages were paid on payroll dates occurring during the quarter (i.e. wages are paid on\r\npayroll dates, therefore wages paid during each quarter are paid on payroll dates that occur during\r\nthe quarter).  Accordingly, appellant is liable only for contributions based on wages paid on\r\npayroll dates occurring after March 15, 1986 and before August 13, 1986, when the corporate\r\nprivileges were revived.<sup> (17)</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>C.  First Quarter Contributions and Penalties</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\t</strong>The first calendar quarter commences January 1 and ends March 30.  The State's\r\nclaim for first quarter contributions and penalties is based on wages paid during the first quarter.\r\nThe State's exhibit \"A\" reflects contributions and penalties due for the first calendar quarter\r\n($7556.69).  Exhibit \"A\" does not segregate that portion of first quarter contributions and\r\npenalties due that is based on wages paid after March 15, 1986, the franchise tax due date. \r\nAppellant is liable for only that portion of first quarter contributions and penalties that is based\r\non wages paid after March 15, 1986.  Therefore, the State has not met its burden to show that it\r\nis entitled as a matter of law to that portion of the judgment against appellant that is based on its\r\nclaim for first quarter contributions and penalties, because it can not be determined from the\r\nsummary judgment proof what portion of the first quarter contributions and penalties due is based\r\non wages paid after March 15, 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>D.  Second Quarter Contributions and Penalties</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\t</strong>The second quarter of the calendar year commences on April 1 and ends June 30. \r\nTherefore, all wages paid during the second quarter were paid after March 15, 1986, the date the\r\nfranchise taxes were due, and before August 13, 1986, the date the corporate privileges were\r\nrevived.  The State's exhibit \"A\" reflects the amount of contributions and penalties due for the\r\nsecond calendar quarter.  The State has shown that its claim for the second quarter contributions\r\nand penalties is based on wages paid after March 15, 1986.  The State has established that the\r\nsecond calendar quarter portion of the debt was created or incurred after the date the franchise\r\ntaxes were due.  Furthermore, Article 5221b-12(e) provides that exhibit \"A,\" which is a sworn\r\nstatement, is <em>prima facie</em> evidence \"that the contributions, penalties or interest shown to be due\r\nby said statement, . . . are, within the knowledge of the Affiant, past due and unpaid,\" unless a\r\nsworn answer to the contrary is filed.  1957 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 460, § 14, at 1357 (Tex. Rev.\r\nCiv. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-12(e), since amended).  Appellant did not file a sworn answer.  The\r\nState has met its burden to show that it is entitled as a matter of law to that portion of the\r\njudgment against appellant that is based on second quarter contributions and penalties due in the\r\namount of $3,764.11.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p></p><center><strong>E.  Conclusion</strong></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe trial court granted the State's motion for summary judgment and ordered that\r\nthe State recover from Wilburn the amount of $11,320.80, representing the contributions and\r\npenalties for the first and second quarters of 1986.  The judgment shows that the amount of\r\ncontributions and penalties due for the first quarter is $7,556.69.  We have determined, however,\r\nthat the State did not show it was entitled, as a matter of law, to that portion of the judgment. \r\nAccordingly, in our judgment issued on November 13, 1991, we reversed and remanded the\r\nportion of the summary judgment that awarded the State contributions and penalties totalling\r\n$11,320.80.  The State then filed a voluntary remittitur in the amount of $7,556.69.  Tex. R.\r\nApp. P. Ann. 85(e)<strong> </strong>(Pamph. 1991).  Because this Court is of the opinion that the remittitur cures\r\nthe reversible error, we accept the remittitur and modify the trial-court judgment accordingly. \r\nRule 85(e).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\tThe judgment of the trial court in favor of the State of Texas and against Phyllis\r\nWilburn is reduced by the amount of $7,556.69 to award the State recovery in the amount of\r\n$3,764.11 against Phyllis Wilburn.

While appellant may be\r\nprecluded from attacking the amount of the judgment, she is not precluded from asserting that\r\nthere is no evidence as to the date the tax liability was created or incurred, because this is a\r\nchallenge to the legal sufficiency of the summary judgment proof.  \r\n</p><p>13.      <sup>13</sup> The calendar year is the period from January 1 to December 31 inclusive.  Black's Law\r\nDictionary 204 (6th ed. 1990).\r\n</p><p>14.      <sup>14</sup> As support for this argument, the State cites <em>Cowan</em> <em>Boat Transfer v. Texas Employment\r\nCom'n, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1492780\"><a href=\"/opinion/1492780/cowan-boat-transfer-inc-v-texas-emp-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (Tex. App. 1990,  dism. agr.).  In <em>Cowan</em>, the employment commission\r\nhad determined that contract truck drivers were in the employ of the appellant.  Consequently,\r\nCowan became an employer subject to the Unemployment Compensation Act for purposes of\r\nunemployment-tax contributions. Nevertheless, Cowan did not pay estimated unemployment-tax\r\ncontributions.  At issue was whether Cowan was obligated to pay the estimated tax contributions\r\nin the absence of a formal assessment by the commission.  <em>Cowan</em>, 789 S.W.2d at 407.  This\r\ncourt concluded that the statutory tax contributions were alleged to be due, for purposes of tax\r\nliability arising under the Act, when the Commission made its notification and ruling. \r\nConsequently, a formal assessment was not a prerequisite to Cowan's obligation to pay the tax\r\nliability.  <em>Id.</em>  <em>Cowan</em> does not stand for the proposition that the tax liability is created or incurred\r\nwhen due.  Nor does <em>Cowan </em>hold that the tax determination occurs when employment taxes are\r\nreported; the determination that Cowan was liable for contributions occurred when the\r\nCommission determined it was an employer of the truck drivers.   \r\n</p><p>15.      <sup>15</sup> Section 4 provides:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>The codified rules of the agencies published in the Texas Administrative Code, as\r\napproved by the secretary of state and as amended by documents subsequently filed\r\nwith the office of the secretary of state, are to be judicially noticed and constitute\r\nprima facie evidence of the text of the documents and of the fact that they are in\r\neffect on and after the date of notation.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat, Ann. art. 6252-13b, § 4 (Supp. 1992)\r\n</p><p>16.      <sup>16</sup> The State has requested that we take judicial notice of Texas Employment Rule 301.7(b). \r\nRule 301.7(b) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Each taxed employer shall submit to the commission, within the month during\r\nwhich contributions for any period become due, and not later than the date on\r\nwhich contributions are required to be paid to the commission, an employer's\r\nquarterly report . . . showing the total amount of wages (as defined in subsection\r\n19(n) of the Act) paid during such quarter for employment,. . . and showing other\r\ninformation called for on the employer's quarterly report form printed by the\r\ncommission.  The employer's quarterly report shall be made on commission forms\r\nand shall contain all facts and information necessary to a determination of the\r\namount of contributions due.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Tex. Employment Comm., 7 Tex. Reg. 2630 (1989) (40 Tex. Admin. Code § 301.7(b), since\r\namended), <em>adopting</em> 7 Tex. Reg. 2107 (proposed rule).  The reporting scheme mandated by rule\r\n301.7(b) provides for a lump sum accounting of wages paid for employment during each quarter. \r\nThe State represents that contributions due are also reported on a lump sum basis.  Pursuant to\r\nTex. R. Civ. Evid. Ann. 204 (Pamph. 1991), we take judicial notice of the rule.\r\n</p><p>17.      <sup>17</sup> Our holding is consistent with the requirement that we strictly construe § 171.255 to protect\r\nthe individual against whom liability is sought.  <em>Rogers</em>, 696 S.W.2d at 677.  It does not ignore\r\nthe administrative scheme created by the Commission, nor does it require the State to conduct an\r\naudit or maintain an action at law in order to ascertain what portion of the contributions, in a\r\nquarter where franchise taxes are due, is based on employment wages paid after the franchise tax\r\ndue date.  We believe that, under Rule 301.7(b), the Commission has the power to require an\r\nemployer to segregate that portion of wages paid for employment between January 1 and the\r\nfranchise tax due date from that portion of employment wages paid after the franchise tax due date\r\nand until the end of the first quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Furthermore, our holding is consistent with the purpose of  §171.255. <em>Schwab,</em> 198 S.W.2d at\r\n81 (statute meant to prevent wrongful acts of culpable officers of a corporation and protect the\r\npublic and those dealing with corporation).  If the State had met its burden to show the amount\r\nof first quarter contributions and penalties that are based on wages paid after March 15, 1986,\r\nWilburn would be personally liable for those amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  \r\n</p>\r\n</div>",
