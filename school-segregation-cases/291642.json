JONES, Chief Judge:\n\f            This case arises out of student transfers from one rural\n\nTexas school district to another.          Before and after the transfers,\n\nboth districts had a majority of racial minority students.1                  The\n\nUnited States and Hearne ISD, the Plaintiff district, contend that\n\nthe transfers impermissibly impeded desegregation and violated a\n\nthirty-five-year-old       desegregation      decree    against      the   Texas\n\nEducation Agency.        The district court ruled in favor of the\n\nPlaintiffs and enjoined the transfer only of white students (even\n\nthough large numbers of black and Hispanic students have also\n\ncontinued to transfer out of Hearne).           After carefully reviewing\n\nthe record, we hold that the court had no basis for sanctioning the\n\ntransferee district, Mumford, a non-party to the original court\n\norder. Further, there is no legal or factual basis for the court’s\n\nfinding of a reduction in desegregation caused by the transfers.\n\nBecause   the   Plaintiffs     are   entitled    to    no   relief   under   the\n\ndesegregation decree, we REVERSE the judgment and VACATE the\n\ndistrict court’s injunction.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1970, the United States brought suit in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Texas against various Texas school districts, the\n\ngoverning county boards of education of each such district and\n\ntheir respective officials, and the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”)\n\n\n      1\n            A school district with a student population comprised of more than\nfifty percent minority students is commonly referred to as a “majority-minority”\ndistrict.   For this purpose, the word “minority” includes African-American,\nHispanic, and Asian.\n\n                                       2\n\fto achieve meaningful school desegregation.           Each of the school\n\ndistricts named as a defendant in the original suit was either an\n\nall-white district or an all-black district that had taken no steps\n\nto comply with the Supreme Court’s desegregation precedent.            The\n\ndistrict court, Judge William Wayne Justice presiding, found that\n\nthe named school districts were responsible for creating and\n\nmaintaining   dual   school   systems   and   that    systemically,   “the\n\nvestiges of racially segregated public education” had not been\n\neliminated.   Accordingly, Judge Justice entered Order 5281, a far-\n\nreaching   desegregation   decree   applicable   to    the   named   school\n\ndistricts and the TEA, which directs funding to the State’s public\n\nschools.    United States v. Texas, 321 F. Supp. 1043 (E.D. Tex.\n\n1970).     The Order contains two parts, the first directed at\n\ndesegregating the named school districts and the second directed at\n\ncorrecting systemic segregation.        Specifically, with respect to\n\ntransfers, the Order enjoined TEA and any person acting in concert\n\nwith TEA\n\n     from permitting, approving or supporting by any means:\n     (1) The inter-district transfer of students within the\n     state of Texas which will reduce or impede desegregation\n     or which will reinforce, renew or encourage the\n     continuation of acts and practices resulting in\n     discriminatory treatment of students on the ground of\n     race, color, or national origin . . . .\nId. at 1060. The Order was later modified by the district court,\n\nUnited States v. Texas, 330 F. Supp. 235 (E.D. Tex. 1971), and\n\nsubsequently by the Fifth Circuit, United States v. Texas, 447 F.2d\n\n\n\n\n                                    3\n\f441 (5th Cir. 1971), but the text of the transfer provision\n\nremained largely the same.\n\n            During the thirty-five years that have elapsed since the\n\noriginal entry of Order 5281, there have been eight decisions in\n\nwhich our Circuit has addressed questions regarding the validity\n\nand applicability of Order 5281,2 and during this same thirty-five-\n\nyear period, the racial composition of public schools in Texas has\n\nchanged drastically. Today, Texas public school districts continue\n\nto expend considerable resources complying with TEA’s directives\n\npursuant to the now-antiquated Order, yet the State has not moved\n\nto terminate it.     Because of the Order’s dwindling relevance, only\n\nthree disputes have arisen under it in the last ten years, and the\n\ncase was administratively closed for three years before this matter\n\nwas filed.     Judge Justice, the judge presiding over the original\n\ndispute in 1970, has remained in charge of the case throughout,\n\neven though he is now on senior status.\n\n            The most recent litigation under Order 5281 has involved\n\nsmall rural school districts fighting over student population in\n\n\n\n\n      2\n            See United States v. Texas, 447 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1971); United\nStates v. Texas (San Felipe-Del Rio), 466 F.2d 518 (5th Cir. 1972); United States\nv. Texas (Wilmer-Hutchins), 508 F.2d 98 (5th Cir. 1975); Gregory-Portland Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Texas Educ. Agency, 576 F.2d 81 (5th Cir. 1978); United States v.\nGregory-Portland Indep. Sch. Dist., 654 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1981); United States\nv. Texas (LULAC), 680 F.2d 356 (5th Cir. 1982); United States v. LULAC, 793 F.2d\n636 (5th Cir. 1986); United States v. Texas (Goodrich), 158 F.3d 299 (5th Cir.\n1998).\n\n                                       4\n\fcontests rooted more in resource allocation than racial injustice.3\n\nTexas has a liberal transfer policy wherein funding from TEA\n\nfollows the student across district lines.                See TEX. EDUC. CODE\n\n§§ 25.035-037.     In this case, Hearne seeks to prevent flight from\n\nits schools and retain funding in the district.              At trial, Hearne\n\nadministrators testified that they were concerned about all student\n\ntransfers, correctly valuing students of all races equally.                   By\n\nintervening into the case underlying Order 5281, however, Hearne\n\ncan only legally complain about the transfer of white students; the\n\ndistrict consequently argues that their voluntary departure has\n\nreduced desegregation in Hearne schools.\n\n            Hearne sued TEA, Mumford Independent School District,\n\nwhich received many Hearne transfers, and Mumford’s superintendent\n\nBienski.    The United States, as Plaintiff to the original Order\n\n5281 litigation, joined the case.          The district court conducted a\n\nbench trial and ruled in favor of the Plaintiffs, enjoining Mumford\n\nfrom accepting any more white transfers — even of students who have\n\nbeen attending Mumford schools for many years — and prohibiting TEA\n\n\n\n\n      3\n            The only noteworthy case within the last ten years, United States v.\nTexas (Goodrich), 158 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 1998), involved a neighborhood’s attempt\nto be annexed to a different school district. Id. at 303. The dispute’s only\nconnection with race and segregation came from the creative legal theories used\nto attempt to prevent a few neighborhood students from taking their funding with\nthem to the other school district. The district court’s order refusing the\nannexation on the basis of Order 5281 was reversed by this court.\n\n                                       5\n\ffrom funding Mumford for those transfers.            This court stayed the\n\ndistrict court’s remedy pending TEA’s and Mumford’s appeal.4\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Jurisdiction\n\n            Mumford first asserts that the district court should not\n\nhave exercised jurisdiction over this dispute through a reopening\n\nof the TEA litigation and Order 5281.          Mumford argues that because\n\nHearne is subject to a prior, separate desegregation order that\n\noriginated in a different court, the court here erred in asserting\n\njurisdiction.     We disagree.      The fact that Hearne was itself the\n\ndefendant in another desegregation case years ago and remains\n\nsubject to a consent decree arising from that suit has no bearing\n\non the State’s compliance with Order 5281.             Accordingly, subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction is proper.\n\n            Mumford also challenges the district court’s reopening of\n\nan administratively closed case and its allowance of Hearne’s\n\nmotion to intervene to enforce Order 5281.               Because a district\n\ncourt may reopen an administratively closed case sua sponte, Mire\n\nv. Full Spectrum Lending Inc., 389 F.3d 163, 167 (5th Cir. 2004),\n\nwe find no abuse of discretion in the district court’s timing and\n\ndecision to reopen the case.       Likewise, the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in permitting Hearne to intervene, as Hearne challenged\n\n\n      4\n            One draconian consequence of the district court’s order would have\nbeen to require transfer students entering into their senior high school year at\nMumford, who have completed nearly all of their education there as transfer\nstudents, to go to Hearne schools instead.\n\n                                       6\n\fTEA’s action under Order 5281, which is a still-effective decree.\n\nSee Trans Chem. Ltd. v. China Nat. Mach. Import & Exp. Corp., 332\n\nF.3d 815, 822 (5th Cir. 2003) (explaining that permissive inter-\n\nvention is reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n             Finally, Mumford contests the district court’s exercise\n\nof jurisdiction against it, a non-party to the original suit, as an\n\nentity acting “in concert” with TEA to violate Order 5281.                  See\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 65(D)) (confining district courts to injunctive\n\nrelief against parties or those “in active concert or participation\n\nwith them”).      Because the court’s judgment must be reversed on\n\nother grounds, we need not decide whether the district court erred\n\nin construing the scope of its Rule 65 authority on the facts\n\npresented, and assume arguendo Mumford acted “in concert” with\n\nTEA.5\n\nB.      Merits\n\n             Order 5281, as occasionally modified,6 prohibits the\n\nState from permitting or supporting in any way\n\n        student transfers, between school districts, when the\n        cumulative effect, in either the sending or receiving\n        school or school district, will be to reduce or impede\n        desegregation.\n\n\n        5\n            The court’s finding that Mumford acted “in concert” with TEA would\nbe subject to doubt for a number of reasons. In particular, TEA administratively\nsanctioned Mumford for not complying with its “one percent guideline” regarding\nstudent transfers and for not accurately reporting hardship transfers. Further,\nin federal court, the parties have taken different legal positions.\n      6\n            In Goodrich, we described Order 5281, with amendments, as the\n“Modified Order.” See 158 F.3d at 301 & n.2. Here, we use the term Order 5281\nsynonymously with Goodrich’s Modified Order, to conform to the parties’ and the\ndistrict court’s terminology in this case.\n\n                                       7\n\fUnited States v. Texas, 447 F.2d 441, 443 (5th Cir. 1971).                  One\n\n“guideline” for enforcing this proscription instructs TEA not to\n\napprove   transfers    whose   effect     “will   change   the   majority   or\n\nminority percentage of the school population by more than one\n\npercent (1%) in either the home or the receiving district or the\n\nhome or the receiving school.”        Under the Order, the white student\n\npopulation is measured against the “minority” population, including\n\nblack and all other minority students.\n\n            Neither Hearne nor Mumford was an original defendant\n\nschool district subject to Order 5281.7           During the past decade,\n\nmore or less, Hearne has lost student population of all races via\n\ntransfers, dropouts, and changes of residence.               While Hearne’s\n\nenrollment declined from nearly 1700 in 1991 to under 1200 in 2004,\n\nMumford grew from a district of just fifty-seven students in 1991\n\nto over four hundred in 2004.       Mumford expanded largely by receiv-\n\ning transfers, mostly from Hearne, and mostly of Hispanic and black\n\nstudents.     Notwithstanding the districts’ changing populations,\n\nboth districts have remained “majority-minority.”\n\n            When analyzing this case, the district court stated\n\nrepeatedly that the critical issue is whether TEA’s funding to\n\nMumford of white transfer students from Hearne violated Order 5281\n\nbecause   such   transfers’    cumulative    effect    reduced    or   impeded\n\n\n      7\n            Hearne, indeed, entered into a desegregation decree in another\narchaic case still technically pending in another Texas federal district court.\nNearly twenty years ago, Hearne represented to that court that all vestiges of\ndesegregation had been eliminated.\n\n                                      8\n\fdesegregation in Hearne.      We cannot fully endorse this characteri-\n\nzation. The Order itself required the court to consider the racial\n\nbalance of both Hearne and Mumford as well as all the transfers and\n\nthe   resulting   student    body   populations,   taking     into   account\n\nHispanic as well as black and white students.           Contrary to the\n\nOrder,   however,   the     court   skewed   its   analysis    toward   the\n\ncomplaining district alone and arbitrarily excluded Hispanics, the\n\nracial group that has grown considerably in both Hearne and Mumford\n\n(just as it has grown all over Texas).       Moreover, the court’s focus\n\nseems to have been misplaced on racial balancing for its own sake\n\nrather than on effectuating the more tailored remedies required in\n\nrecent years by the Supreme Court and this court.       The court should\n\nhave been more mindful of Goodrich, where this court recited\n\napplicable Supreme Court cases and held that “since there is no\n\nreason why [Order 5281] must be interpreted to extend the district\n\ncourt’s remedial jurisdiction beyond limits articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court, prudence and deference to the High Court strongly\n\ncounsel enforcement of the Order consistent with rather than in the\n\nteeth of its pronouncements.”       United States v. Texas (Goodrich),\n\n158 F.3d 299, 311-12 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n           Wisely, however, the court declined to equate a violation\n\nof the one percent guideline with a violation of Order 5281.\n\nGoodrich disapproved, albeit in the context of school boundary\n\nchanges rather than student transfers, prophylactic percentage\n\ntests that have little or no connection to the remedial facts\n\n                                     9\n\funderlying Order 5281.       Even as to student transfers, within the\n\nOrder itself,     a   guideline   is   a    guideline,   not   an   inflexible\n\ncommand.8\n\n            Bearing in mind these initial observations, we analyze\n\nseparately the appellate points of TEA and Mumford.\n\n1.    TEA\n\n            The district court enjoined TEA from funding all white\n\ntransfers from Hearne to Mumford, even if those students had\n\nattended Mumford for their entire school careers.           In doing so, the\n\ncourt disregarded that TEA had previously sanctioned Mumford for\n\nits Order 5281 reporting violations by refusing to fund any new\n\ntransfers.    For reasons originating in the adoption of automated\n\nreporting devices, TEA made a policy decision to recognize two\n\nlevels of transfers.      All students who had already transferred as\n\nof the 2000-2001 school year were considered “baseline” students.\n\nStudents who had transferred for the 2001-2002 school year were\n\nconsidered “grandfathered” students.            TEA has continued to fund\n\nbaseline    and   grandfathered    students,    as   well   as   siblings   of\n\nbaseline transfers, finding a disruption in funding to be contrary\n\nto desirable educational policy. The district court rejected TEA’s\n\nbalancing approach and ordered TEA to cease all funding for any\n\n      8\n            The one percent guideline may well be an unenforceable vestige of\nconditions long since substantially remedied. The guideline lives on, however,\nas a cause of voluminous continuous recordkeeping and monitoring by TEA and all\nTexas school districts. Because the State calculates that it would cost more to\nchallenge the guideline than to enforce it, the State’s limited education\nresources remained devoted to the highly questionable bureaucratic exercise of\nimplementing the guideline.\n\n                                       10\n\fwhite    transfers    —    including     the     baseline    and      grandfathered\n\ntransfers — from Hearne to Mumford.\n\n            Because “injunctive relief must not transcend the scope\n\nof the violation,” a court enforcing Order 5281 against an original\n\nparty thereto must find that transfers “reduce desegregation or\n\nreinforce the existence of a dual system” before enjoining such\n\ntransfers.     Lee v. Eufaula City Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d 229, 234\n\n(5th Cir. 1978).      “In measuring the cumulative effect of a student\n\ntransfer program on desegregation, the Court must do so from a\n\nqualitative viewpoint, without blind deference to an objective\n\nmathematical formula.”         Id. at 232; see also Davis v. Bd. of Sch.\n\nComm’rs, 393 F.2d 690, 693 (5th Cir. 1968) (explaining that “school\n\ndesegregation       can    first    be   measured        quantitatively,          using\n\npercentages as a rough rule of thumb, but ultimately must be\n\nmeasured     qualitatively,        judging     whether      schools       are     still\n\nidentifiable” as one-race schools).               If, after performing both\n\nquantitative and qualitative analysis, the court finds that there\n\nis   a   violation    of   a   desegregation       decree,       it   must      fashion\n\nappropriately    tailored      equitable       relief.      In     this   case,     the\n\ndistrict court’s quantitative and qualitative findings were clearly\n\nerroneous,    and    the   district      court    abused     its      discretion     in\n\nfashioning such a broad remedy.\n\n            The first step of a transfer analysis looks at the\n\nquantitative effect of the transfers on both school districts.\n\nPrevious cases explain what this analysis entails.                    See, e.g., Lee\n\n                                         11\n\fv. Lee County Bd. of Educ., 639 F.2d 1243, 1261 (5th Cir. 1981);\n\nEufaula, 573 F.2d at 234.      Although this court has “refused to\n\nsanction the use of strict quantitative or percentage analysis in\n\nmeasuring the effect of a transfer program on desegregation,” it\n\nhas noted “that the range of deviation may be significant in\n\nmeasuring qualitative segregative effect.”     Eufaula, 573 F.2d at\n\n233 n.9. Specifically, “a transfer program which has the effect of\n\nincreasing the black student population in a particular school from\n\n90% to 100% may be more suspect than a corresponding 10% increase\n\nfrom 50% to 60%.”   Id.   Another test comes from the Sixth Circuit:\n\nwhether the “foreseeable and actual result of a transfer policy is\n\nto increase the racial identifiability of schools.”      Id. at 233\n\n(quoting NAACP v. Lansing Bd. of Educ., 559 F.2d 1042, 1051 (6th\n\nCir. 1977)).\n\n          Most important for present purposes, small changes in the\n\nracial composition of a district through transfers cannot justify\n\nmandatory interdistrict desegregation remedies.     See Lee County,\n\n639 F.2d at 1261.    In Lee County, the white transfers out of a\n\nparticular school caused the racial composition of the school to\n\nchange from ninety-one percent black to ninety-six percent black.\n\n“This increment of change in the racial composition of a school\n\nseems unlikely to alter significantly general perceptions of a\n\nschool’s racial identity or the behavior of persons who rely on\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fsuch factors in determining whether or not to send their children\n\nto a particular school.”       Id.9\n\n             Contrary to the district court’s finding, the numbers in\n\nthis case do not prove that the transfers from Hearne to Mumford\n\nreduced desegregation or caused Hearne to transform into a one-race\n\nschool.      Of equal significance, the district court ignored the\n\nrace-neutral impact that transfers of all races has had on Mumford.\n\n             Following the district court’s emphasis, we focus on\n\nHearne first.      At their highest percentage in 2001-2002, 56.67\n\npercent of students attending Hearne were African-American.                 The\n\nlowest percentage of African-American students was 50.71 percent in\n\n1998-99.10      The    district    court’s     exhaustive     discussion     of\n\nmathematical calculations, percentages and percentage points is\n\nrendered moot by this simple comparison, as this court has already\n\nexplained that a change, because of transfers, in percentage of\n\nblack students from fifty percent to sixty percent would be “less\n\nsuspect.”     Eufaula, 573 F.2d at 233 n.9.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n            As will be seen infra, “perceptions alone cannot form the basis for\nfederal court intervention”; actual segregative effect is needed to support a\nfinding that transfers reduce desegregation. See Goodrich, 158 F.3d at 311.\n      10\n              These percentages derive from Trial Exhibit 237, an exhibit the\ndistrict court found reliable and used in its calculations. Trial Exhibit 237\npresents data from 1996 to 2004.     The highest percentage of white students\nattended Hearne in 1996-1997, when 23.50 percent of the student population was\nwhite. The lowest percentage occurred in 2003-2004, when 12.98 percent of the\nstudent population was white. Hearne’s resident population of white students has\nalso fallen, from a high of 26.18 percent in 1998-1999 to a low of 19.41 percent\nin 2003-2004.\n\n                                      13\n\f          The district court also erred because it examined only\n\nthe impact of the transfers on the percentage of black and white\n\nstudents in Hearne, ignoring the substantial and growing portion of\n\nHispanic students.   A central purpose of desegregation decrees was\n\nto prevent, to the extent practicable and not attributable to\n\ndemographic changes, the continued existence of one-race schools.\n\nSee, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1,\n\n26, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 1281 (1971); Tasby v. Black Coal. to Maximize\n\nEduc., 771 F.2d 849, 851 n.3, 855 (5th Cir. 1985) (discussing\n\nconcern over predominantly black schools in a school district where\n\nfifty percent of the students were black and twenty-three percent\n\nwere Hispanic); see also Ross v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 699\n\nF.2d 218, 226 (5th Cir. 1983) (“[I]n seeking reduction in the\n\nnumber of one-race schools, the district court could not ignore\n\ndiminished white enrollment in [the district] and substantial\n\nimmigration of Hispanic students.”).     Hearne is, however, nowhere\n\nclose to becoming a one-race school, as the largest percentage of\n\nblack students since 1998 has been fifty-six percent.\n\n          Furthermore,   even   by   grouping   blacks   and   Hispanics\n\ntogether as one minority group, the change in population at Hearne\n\nwould not be so significant as to imply a return to segregation.\n\nIn the years 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, when the attendance of white\n\n\n\n\n                                 14\n\fstudents reached its lowest point — approximately thirteen percent11\n\n— the resident population of white students was 22.11 percent and\n\n19.41 percent, respectively.12           These differences are simply not\n\nenough to mark a return to segregation as a result of State action\n\nthrough the transfer funding. See Lee County, 639 F.2d at 1261\n\n(finding it unreasonable “to conclude that this small number of\n\ntransfers effectively perpetuated the segregative effect of earlier\n\nactions”).       Also noteworthy is that TEA cannot be held liable for\n\na decline in Hearne’s white student population caused by a decline\n\nin white residency within the district.\n\n              Accordingly, to the extent that the district court relied\n\non a quantitative analysis to show that white transfers from Hearne\n\nto Mumford were “transforming the district into a predominantly\n\nAfrican-American district when it would not otherwise be so,” its\n\nfindings are clearly erroneous.              To be sure, Hearne’s enrollment\n\n\n      11\n               In 2001-2002, 165 of Hearne’s 1267 students, or 13.02 percent, were\nwhite.     In 2003-2004, 153 of Hearne’s 1179 students, or 12.98 percent, were\nwhite.\n      12\n             The district court performed an additional unnecessary calculation\nby determining what the “white enrollment of Hearne would have been if there were\nno white transfers to Mumford.” This calculation omits the significant numbers\nof Hispanic and African-American students that also transferred from Hearne to\nMumford. Under the district court’s calculation and subsequent injunction, black\nand Hispanic students could freely transfer from Hearne to Mumford, but white\nstudents would not be allowed. Such an odd result appears to violate the rule\nthat transfers be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. See Lee v. Eufaula\nCity Bd. of Educ., 573 F.2d 229, 232 n.6 (5th Cir. 1978) (“[A] ruling that only\nblack students may transfer into the . . . school system would itself run afoul\nof Singleton, which clearly prohibits acceptance of transfers on a racially\ndiscriminatory basis.”)(citing Singleton v. Jackson Mun. Separate Sch. Dist.,\n419 F.2d 1211, 1218-19 (5th Cir. 1969)).      Further, even under the district\ncourt’s “white transfers only” analysis, the largest net effect of the transfers\nis a mere 9.97 percentage points, from 22.99 percent to 13.02 percent. Even this\nnumerical difference cannot be found to resegregate Hearne.\n\n                                        15\n\fhas declined for several reasons, including transfers out of the\n\ndistrict.       But Mumford’s acceptance of transfer students of all\n\nraces has produced no segregative effect in Hearne.\n\n            The district court’s findings also fell short by failing\n\nto consider the impact of transfers on Mumford’s racial makeup.\n\nOrder   5281,    as   well   as    above-cited        desegregation       principles,\n\nrequired    a    holistic    look    at    the       transfer   policy’s       impact.\n\nUnsurprisingly,       perhaps,     there       has    plainly   been      no   adverse\n\nconsequence.       Mumford has accepted larger absolute numbers of\n\nminority transfers than white transfers.                  Mumford was and remains\n\na majority-minority district.            Its most recent racial composition\n\nwas fourteen percent black, forty-one percent white and forty-five\n\npercent Hispanic.       Mumford’s growth must be explained by factors\n\nother than an institutional desire to move itself — or Hearne —\n\ntoward one-race status.\n\n            The district court found, qualitatively, that “[t]he\n\ntransfers from Hearne have resulted in members of Hearne and\n\nneighboring communities perceiving Hearne as ‘basically a black\n\nschool district,’ comprising mainly or exclusively black students.”\n\nOf course, “perceptions alone” cannot form the entirety of a\n\nqualitative analysis, Goodrich, 158 F.3d at 311.                    Moreover, the\n\nwitnesses’      perceptions       were    full       of   hearsay   and     illogical\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fconclusions.13 Even if the testimony before the district court were\n\nreliable, the district court never established, as required by\n\nGoodrich, whether such perceptions arose from parents’ private\n\nchoices or State action in the form of TEA-funded transfers.                    See\n\nGoodrich, 158 F.3d at 310-11.            Instead, the district court found\n\nthat    Hearne    does   not     have   unusual    discipline     problems,     and\n\napparently parents would thus have no reason to move or transfer\n\ntheir children from Hearne to Mumford.                  The proper qualitative\n\nanalysis would acknowledge that Mumford has always accepted more\n\nblack and Hispanic transfers than white transfers and has itself\n\nremained a majority-minority district.             TEA’s funding of transfers\n\nhas had no significant net racial impact on either district.\n\n             In sum, the conclusory statements that Hearne is a\n\n“black” school, despite the fact that at no point in the relevant\n\ntime period have black students comprised more than fifty-six\n\npercent     of   the   student    population,     are    not    indicative     of   a\n\nresegregative effect in Hearne.               As in Goodrich, “[b]ecause the\n\ndistrict     court’s     findings       of    segregative      effects   are    too\n\n\n       13\n              The district court relied upon, first, the testimony of Norris\nMcDaniel, Hearne’s former superintendent. McDaniel testified that the perception\nof the Hearne District is one of “just basically a black school district.” He\nbuttressed this conclusion by discussing a conversation he had with a woman who\nhad just moved into the district and noticed that “there were a lot of black\npeople in Hearne.” The district court then accepted the testimony of principal\nCaroline Reed, who was concerned because she saw a lot of white kids playing\nLittle League baseball in Hearne, but her school did not have many white faces.\nShe further testified that her perception of a “predominantly black school” was\none with a majority of African-American students. Finally, the district court\nrelied upon the testimony of Hearne board member James Taylor. Taylor testified\nhe perceived Hearne to be a predominantly black school, in large part because\nHearne’s sports teams were predominantly black.\n\n                                         17\n\fspeculative, not supported by the record, or are rooted in private\n\nconduct rather than state action, they are clearly erroneous and\n\nlegally insufficient.”      Id. at 311.\n\n              Finally, even if the court’s findings that the transfers\n\nhad a resegregative impact were not clearly erroneous, the court’s\n\noverbroad remedy would be an abuse of discretion.              The district\n\ncourt ordered TEA to stop funding all white transfers from Hearne\n\nto Mumford, even if those students had attended Mumford for years.\n\nThis remedy grossly exceeds any possible violation of the original\n\ndesegregation order.\n\n              The facts found by the district court demonstrate that\n\nthe   white    student   population   at   Hearne   declined   to   thirteen\n\npercent, while the black population stood at fifty-six percent.\n\nTEA has refused to fund any new transfers to Mumford as a result of\n\nMumford’s reporting violations and contends that any possible\n\nresegregative effect will be erased by attrition as the baselined\n\nstudents graduate or move.\n\n              We do not comment on the legal merit of TEA’s chosen\n\nsanction for Mumford’s administrative violations. The issue before\n\nus is whether the court’s injunction is among those federal-court\n\ndecrees that “exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at\n\neliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or\n\ndoes not flow from such a violation.”               Milliken v. Bradley,\n\n433 U.S. 267, 282 (1977); see also Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n v.\n\nPennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 399, 102 S. Ct. 3141, 3154-55 (1982)\n\n                                      18\n\f(holding that the remedial powers of the federal courts “could be\n\nexercised only on the basis of a violation of law and could extend\n\nno   farther    than   required      by   the    nature    and   extent     of   that\n\nviolation”).      The violation here, summed up by the district court\n\nand the Plaintiffs, is that the percentage of white students at one\n\nschool district is declining, and thus “impeding desegregation,”\n\nbecause   those    students    are    transferring        to   another    majority-\n\nminority district.       Yet all TEA did was continue to fund transfer\n\nstudents already attending the receiving district after it learned\n\nthat the one percent guideline had been violated.                           Even if,\n\ncontrary to the foregoing discussion, a violation of Order 5281 had\n\noccurred here, the magnitude of the violation is ambiguous, and the\n\nmotivation of TEA utterly benign.                 These conditions may have\n\njustified a remedial order that would have deferred to TEA’s\n\nsolomonic solution. Instead, the district court’s order threatened\n\nto inflict a harsh and immediate funding reduction on Mumford and\n\nto penalize many innocent students who would be abruptly forced\n\ninto changing school districts.\n\n           We     do   not   denigrate     the   importance      of   the    State’s\n\ncompliance with Order 5281, as long as it is on the books.\n\nNevertheless, the Order must be implemented, as we have stated,\n\nconsistent with the Supreme Court’s evolution in its approach to\n\nremedial judicial decrees.        The district court’s draconian remedy\n\nfailed to follow these standards.\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f2.    Mumford\n\n              In addition to enjoining TEA from funding the Hearne-to-\n\nMumford   transfers,         the   district      court    enjoined   Mumford     from\n\naccepting all white transfer students (“without legitimate hardship\n\nexemptions”) from Hearne. The court held that Mumford acted “in\n\nconcert” with TEA in violation of Order 5281 by accepting students\n\nwhose transfers reduced or impeded desegregation in Hearne.                     As we\n\nhave invalidated the district court’s findings and remedial order\n\nconcerning     TEA,    the    injunction        against   Mumford    cannot   stand.\n\nNevertheless, it is necessary to point out serious flaws in the\n\ndistrict court’s analysis lest there be a perception that Mumford\n\nhas been let off the hook notwithstanding its own misconduct.\n\nMumford may not be exposed to liability for violating an order to\n\nwhich it was not a party without evidence of Mumford’s intentional\n\nacts of segregation.         Because the district court did not, and from\n\nthe   facts    could    not,       find   that    Mumford   engaged    in     conduct\n\nintentionally designed to foster racial segregation or to interfere\n\nwith desegregation in Hearne, the injunction against Mumford cannot\n\nstand.\n\n              Based on its finding that Mumford acted “in concert” with\n\nTEA to violate Order 5281, the district court held that Mumford’s\n\nlack of racial or segregative motive was irrelevant so long as the\n\neffect of its conduct violated the Order.                    This was reversible\n\nerror.    This court has long stated that “a federal court cannot\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fimpose liability on individual defendant school districts on the\n\nbasis of a general inverse respondeat superior theory holding them\n\npresumptively responsible for actions of the state or another\n\ngovernmental entity.”              Lee County, 639 F.2d at 1256 (citing and\n\ndiscussing Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 94 S. Ct. 3112\n\n(1974)).   “[N]o local district may be subjected to remedial orders\n\nbased on past segregative or other constitutionally invidious local\n\npractices of which it has been condemned unheard.”                        United States\n\nv. Texas (LULAC), 680 F.2d 356, 373 (5th Cir. 1982).                             Because\n\nMumford was not a party defendant to the original litigation that\n\nresulted in Order 5281, it cannot be condemned for violating the\n\nOrder   without        a    finding      that     it     intentionally      engaged      in\n\nsegregative conduct.\n\n           Further, a finding that Mumford violated a prophylactic\n\nprovision in Order 5281 is not an adequate substitute for proof of\n\nintentional      segregative        conduct.           In   United     States   v.   Texas\n\n(Gregory-Portland), 654 F.2d 989 (5th Cir. 1981), this court\n\nreversed an order requiring busing of Mexican-American students\n\nthroughout a school district in South Texas.                         Id. at 996.        The\n\ndistrict   court       had       concluded     that      “[i]f   TEA    determines      the\n\nexistence of ethnically identifiable schools, it need show nothing\n\nfurther;” specifically, TEA was not “required to find discrimina-\n\ntory    intent    on       the    part    of      [the      school   district]       before\n\nimplementing” sanctions based on Order 5281.                           United States v.\n\nTexas, 498 F. Supp. 1356, 1366 (E.D. Tex. 1980).                           We reversed,\n\n                                             21\n\foverruling the district court’s reliance on imputed and presumptive\n\ndiscrimination. Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 996. We invalidated\n\na procedure whereby TEA could sanction school districts solely on\n\nthe basis of a numerical trigger:\n\n      [B]y the order of August 1973, the district court\n      established TEA as its agent for purposes of combing the\n      Texas   school  districts   in   search  of   ethnically\n      disproportionate campuses. These the court defined as\n      ones comprising student bodies more than 66 percent\n      minority. On finding one, and without further hearing or\n      inquiry into causation, TEA was to do as it did here:\n      offer the district a choice between accepting a student\n      assignment plan or plans devised by TEA to dilute\n      minority attendance, or suffering the imposition of\n      sanctions calculated to disestablish it.    Relief from\n      either could be had only by the district’s proving its\n      innocence of discriminatory intent in a single and\n      faraway federal court.\n\nId. at 997.    The procedure was fatally flawed, because “[t]o infer\n\ndiscriminatory intent from such slender factual data and act\n\ndecisively upon that inference is to run a high risk of acting\n\nunjustly.”      Id. at 997.         We concluded:          “[T]he ultimate and\n\ndispositive issue is that of the intent with which an autonomous\n\nbody, [the school district], acted in making student assignments.”\n\nId. at 999.     It follows from these authorities that the district\n\ncourt   erred        by     cursorily    dismissing        Mumford’s         lack   of\n\ndiscriminatory intent as irrelevant.\n\n             There    is,    moreover,       no   direct    evidence     condemning\n\nMumford.     Mumford’s “violation” of the one percent guideline found\n\nin   Order    5281    and    used   as   a     trigger     by   TEA    for    further\n\ninvestigation is not indicative of intentional discrimination. The\n\n\n                                         22\n\fFifth Circuit has rejected bare numerical requirements in the\n\ncontext of transfers.       See, e.g., Eufaula, 573 F.2d at 232 & n.6.\n\nAnd, as Gregory-Portland explained, discriminatory intent cannot be\n\npresumed from “such slender factual data.”              Gregory-Portland,\n\n654 F.2d at 997.       The facts surrounding the Hearne-to-Mumford\n\ntransfers demonstrate why a numerical guideline is of so little\n\nimport.     Before it accepted transfer students, Mumford was a tiny\n\nschool district with fewer than sixty students.           Once it started\n\naccepting transfer students, parents of all races began to send\n\ntheir children to Mumford.         The court’s focus on white student\n\ntransfers alone was misplaced, as Mumford has accepted students of\n\nall races whose parents evidently seek educational opportunities of\n\na different nature than those that exist in Hearne.\n\n            The district court faulted the district because it gave\n\nincorrect data to TEA and encouraged parents to claim hardship\n\nexemptions to TEA’s rigid numerical requirements.          As stipulated,\n\nMumford did not provide TEA with transfer data for several years.\n\nThe district court found that this “pattern of fraudulent conduct\n\n. . . demonstrated a consistent and persistent willingness to\n\ncircumvent the requirements of [Order] 5281 whenever possible.”\n\nYet   the   question   is   not   whether    Mumford   complied   with   TEA\n\ndirectives; Mumford must have acted with discriminatory intent in\n\naccepting the transfers.       See Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 999.\n\nMumford’s mishandling of reporting requirements, without more, does\n\nnot prove discriminatory intent.          Accordingly, the district court\n\n                                     23\n\fhad no legal or factual basis to enjoin Mumford from accepting\n\nwhite transfer students.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n          Though   it      is   certainly     possible   that   racial\n\ndiscrimination still exists with regard to the treatment of black\n\nstudents in Texas schools, no evidence of segregation or its\n\nvestiges was presented in the instant case.        The battle between\n\nHearne and Mumford is fought for transfer dollars rather than\n\nracial justice.    For the reasons expressed above, the district\n\ncourt’s application of the timeworn Order 5281 was in error.       We\n\ntherefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court, and VACATE\n\nits injunction against Mumford and TEA.\n\n          REVERSED AND VACATED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\f",

JONES, Chief Judge:\n\f            This case arises out of student transfers from one rural\n\nTexas school district to another.          Before and after the transfers,\n\nboth districts had a majority of racial minority students.1                  The\n\nUnited States and Hearne ISD, the Plaintiff district, contend that\n\nthe transfers impermissibly impeded desegregation and violated a\n\nthirty-five-year-old       desegregation      decree    against      the   Texas\n\nEducation Agency.        The district court ruled in favor of the\n\nPlaintiffs and enjoined the transfer only of white students (even\n\nthough large numbers of black and Hispanic students have also\n\ncontinued to transfer out of Hearne).           After carefully reviewing\n\nthe record, we hold that the court had no basis for sanctioning the\n\ntransferee district, Mumford, a non-party to the original court\n\norder. Further, there is no legal or factual basis for the court’s\n\nfinding of a reduction in desegregation caused by the transfers.\n\nBecause   the   Plaintiffs     are   entitled    to    no   relief   under   the\n\ndesegregation decree, we REVERSE the judgment and VACATE the\n\ndistrict court’s injunction.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1970, the United States brought suit in the Eastern\n\nDistrict of Texas against various Texas school districts, the\n\ngoverning county boards of education of each such district and\n\ntheir respective officials, and the Texas Education Agency (“TEA”)\n\n\n      1\n            A school district with a student population comprised of more than\nfifty percent minority students is commonly referred to as a “majority-minority”\ndistrict.   For this purpose, the word “minority” includes African-American,\nHispanic, and Asian.\n\n                                       2\n\fto achieve meaningful school desegregation.           Each of the school\n\ndistricts named as a defendant in the original suit was either an\n\nall-white district or an all-black district that had taken no steps\n\nto comply with the Supreme Court’s desegregation precedent.            The\n\ndistrict court, Judge William Wayne Justice presiding, found that\n\nthe named school districts were responsible for creating and\n\nmaintaining   dual   school   systems   and   that    systemically,   “the\n\nvestiges of racially segregated public education” had not been\n\neliminated.   Accordingly, Judge Justice entered Order 5281, a far-\n\nreaching   desegregation   decree   applicable   to    the   named   school\n\ndistricts and the TEA, which directs funding to the State’s public\n\nschools.

The Order contains two parts, the first directed at\n\ndesegregating the named school districts and the second directed at\n\ncorrecting systemic segregation.        Specifically, with respect to\n\ntransfers, the Order enjoined TEA and any person acting in concert\n\nwith TEA\n\n     from permitting, approving or supporting by any means:\n     (1) The inter-district transfer of students within the\n     state of Texas which will reduce or impede desegregation\n     or which will reinforce, renew or encourage the\n     continuation of acts and practices resulting in\n     discriminatory treatment of students on the ground of\n     race, color, or national origin . . . .\nId. at 1060.

Today, Texas public school districts continue\n\nto expend considerable resources complying with TEA’s directives\n\npursuant to the now-antiquated Order, yet the State has not moved\n\nto terminate it.

See TEX. EDUC. CODE\n\n§§ 25.035-037.     In this case, Hearne seeks to prevent flight from\n\nits schools and retain funding in the district.              At trial, Hearne\n\nadministrators testified that they were concerned about all student\n\ntransfers, correctly valuing students of all races equally.                   By\n\nintervening into the case underlying Order 5281, however, Hearne\n\ncan only legally complain about the transfer of white students; the\n\ndistrict consequently argues that their voluntary departure has\n\nreduced desegregation in Hearne schools.\n\n            Hearne sued TEA, Mumford Independent School District,\n\nwhich received many Hearne transfers, and Mumford’s superintendent\n\nBienski.

Id. at 303. The dispute’s only\nconnection with race and segregation came from the creative legal theories used\nto attempt to prevent a few neighborhood students from taking their funding with\nthem to the other school district. The district court’s order refusing the\nannexation on the basis of Order 5281 was reversed by this court.\n\n                                       5\n\ffrom funding Mumford for those transfers.            This court stayed the\n\ndistrict court’s remedy pending TEA’s and Mumford’s appeal.4\n\n                               II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Jurisdiction\n\n            Mumford first asserts that the district court should not\n\nhave exercised jurisdiction over this dispute through a reopening\n\nof the TEA litigation and Order 5281.          Mumford argues that because\n\nHearne is subject to a prior, separate desegregation order that\n\noriginated in a different court, the court here erred in asserting\n\njurisdiction.     We disagree.      The fact that Hearne was itself the\n\ndefendant in another desegregation case years ago and remains\n\nsubject to a consent decree arising from that suit has no bearing\n\non the State’s compliance with Order 5281.             Accordingly, subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction is proper.\n\n            Mumford also challenges the district court’s reopening of\n\nan administratively closed case and its allowance of Hearne’s\n\nmotion to intervene to enforce Order 5281.               Because a district\n\ncourt may reopen an administratively closed case sua sponte, Mire\n\nv.

Likewise, the court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in permitting Hearne to intervene, as Hearne challenged\n\n\n      4\n            One draconian consequence of the district court’s order would have\nbeen to require transfer students entering into their senior high school year at\nMumford, who have completed nearly all of their education there as transfer\nstudents, to go to Hearne schools instead.\n\n                                       6\n\fTEA’s action under Order 5281, which is a still-effective decree.\n\nSee Trans Chem. Ltd. v. China Nat. Mach. Import & Exp. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31278\"><a href=\"/opinion/31278/trans-chemical-ltd-v-china-natl-machinery/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (5th Cir. 2003) (explaining that permissive inter-\n\nvention is reviewed for abuse of discretion).\n\n             Finally, Mumford contests the district court’s exercise\n\nof jurisdiction against it, a non-party to the original suit, as an\n\nentity acting “in concert” with TEA to violate Order 5281.                  See\n\nFED. R. CIV. P. 65(D)) (confining district courts to injunctive\n\nrelief against parties or those “in active concert or participation\n\nwith them”).      Because the court’s judgment must be reversed on\n\nother grounds, we need not decide whether the district court erred\n\nin construing the scope of its Rule 65 authority on the facts\n\npresented, and assume arguendo Mumford acted “in concert” with\n\nTEA.5\n\nB.      Merits\n\n             Order 5281, as occasionally modified,6 prohibits the\n\nState from permitting or supporting in any way\n\n        student transfers, between school districts, when the\n        cumulative effect, in either the sending or receiving\n        school or school district, will be to reduce or impede\n        desegregation.\n\n\n        5\n            The court’s finding that Mumford acted “in concert” with TEA would\nbe subject to doubt for a number of reasons. In particular, TEA administratively\nsanctioned Mumford for not complying with its “one percent guideline” regarding\nstudent transfers and for not accurately reporting hardship transfers. Further,\nin federal court, the parties have taken different legal positions.\n      6\n            In Goodrich, we described Order 5281, with amendments, as the\n“Modified Order.” See 158 F.3d at 301 & n.2. Here, we use the term Order 5281\nsynonymously with Goodrich’s Modified Order, to conform to the parties’ and the\ndistrict court’s terminology in this case.\n\n                                       7\n\fUnited States v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"298633\"><a href=\"/opinion/298633/united-states-v-state-of-texas-and-dr-j-w-edgar-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 443 (5th Cir. 1971).                  One\n\n“guideline” for enforcing this proscription instructs TEA not to\n\napprove   transfers    whose   effect     “will   change   the   majority   or\n\nminority percentage of the school population by more than one\n\npercent (1%) in either the home or the receiving district or the\n\nhome or the receiving school.”        Under the Order, the white student\n\npopulation is measured against the “minority” population, including\n\nblack and all other minority students.\n\n            Neither Hearne nor Mumford was an original defendant\n\nschool district subject to Order 5281.7           During the past decade,\n\nmore or less, Hearne has lost student population of all races via\n\ntransfers, dropouts, and changes of residence.               While Hearne’s\n\nenrollment declined from nearly 1700 in 1991 to under 1200 in 2004,\n\nMumford grew from a district of just fifty-seven students in 1991\n\nto over four hundred in 2004.       Mumford expanded largely by receiv-\n\ning transfers, mostly from Hearne, and mostly of Hispanic and black\n\nstudents.     Notwithstanding the districts’ changing populations,\n\nboth districts have remained “majority-minority.”\n\n            When analyzing this case, the district court stated\n\nrepeatedly that the critical issue is whether TEA’s funding to\n\nMumford of white transfer students from Hearne violated Order 5281\n\nbecause   such   transfers’    cumulative    effect    reduced    or   impeded\n\n\n      7\n            Hearne, indeed, entered into a desegregation decree in another\narchaic case still technically pending in another Texas federal district court.\nNearly twenty years ago, Hearne represented to that court that all vestiges of\ndesegregation had been eliminated.\n\n                                      8\n\fdesegregation in Hearne.      We cannot fully endorse this characteri-\n\nzation. The Order itself required the court to consider the racial\n\nbalance of both Hearne and Mumford as well as all the transfers and\n\nthe   resulting   student    body   populations,   taking     into   account\n\nHispanic as well as black and white students.           Contrary to the\n\nOrder,   however,   the     court   skewed   its   analysis    toward   the\n\ncomplaining district alone and arbitrarily excluded Hispanics, the\n\nracial group that has grown considerably in both Hearne and Mumford\n\n(just as it has grown all over Texas).       Moreover, the court’s focus\n\nseems to have been misplaced on racial balancing for its own sake\n\nrather than on effectuating the more tailored remedies required in\n\nrecent years by the Supreme Court and this court.       The court should\n\nhave been more mindful of Goodrich, where this court recited\n\napplicable Supreme Court cases and held that “since there is no\n\nreason why [Order 5281] must be interpreted to extend the district\n\ncourt’s remedial jurisdiction beyond limits articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court, prudence and deference to the High Court strongly\n\ncounsel enforcement of the Order consistent with rather than in the\n\nteeth of its pronouncements.”       United States v.

Even as to student transfers, within the\n\nOrder itself,     a   guideline   is   a    guideline,   not   an   inflexible\n\ncommand.8\n\n            Bearing in mind these initial observations, we analyze\n\nseparately the appellate points of TEA and Mumford.\n\n1.    TEA\n\n            The district court enjoined TEA from funding all white\n\ntransfers from Hearne to Mumford, even if those students had\n\nattended Mumford for their entire school careers.           In doing so, the\n\ncourt disregarded that TEA had previously sanctioned Mumford for\n\nits Order 5281 reporting violations by refusing to fund any new\n\ntransfers.    For reasons originating in the adoption of automated\n\nreporting devices, TEA made a policy decision to recognize two\n\nlevels of transfers.      All students who had already transferred as\n\nof the 2000-2001 school year were considered “baseline” students.\n\nStudents who had transferred for the 2001-2002 school year were\n\nconsidered “grandfathered” students.            TEA has continued to fund\n\nbaseline    and   grandfathered    students,    as   well   as   siblings   of\n\nbaseline transfers, finding a disruption in funding to be contrary\n\nto desirable educational policy. The district court rejected TEA’s\n\nbalancing approach and ordered TEA to cease all funding for any\n\n      8\n            The one percent guideline may well be an unenforceable vestige of\nconditions long since substantially remedied. The guideline lives on, however,\nas a cause of voluminous continuous recordkeeping and monitoring by TEA and all\nTexas school districts. Because the State calculates that it would cost more to\nchallenge the guideline than to enforce it, the State’s limited education\nresources remained devoted to the highly questionable bureaucratic exercise of\nimplementing the guideline.\n\n                                       10\n\fwhite    transfers    —    including     the     baseline    and      grandfathered\n\ntransfers — from Hearne to Mumford.\n\n            Because “injunctive relief must not transcend the scope\n\nof the violation,” a court enforcing Order 5281 against an original\n\nparty thereto must find that transfers “reduce desegregation or\n\nreinforce the existence of a dual system” before enjoining such\n\ntransfers.

Although this court has “refused to\n\nsanction the use of strict quantitative or percentage analysis in\n\nmeasuring the effect of a transfer program on desegregation,” it\n\nhas noted “that the range of deviation may be significant in\n\nmeasuring qualitative segregative effect.”     Eufaula, 573 F.2d at\n\n233 n.9. Specifically, “a transfer program which has the effect of\n\nincreasing the black student population in a particular school from\n\n90% to 100% may be more suspect than a corresponding 10% increase\n\nfrom 50% to 60%.”   Id.   Another test comes from the Sixth Circuit:\n\nwhether the “foreseeable and actual result of a transfer policy is\n\nto increase the racial identifiability of schools.”      Id. at 233\n\n(quoting NAACP v.

See Lee County,\n\n639 F.2d at 1261.    In Lee County, the white transfers out of a\n\nparticular school caused the racial composition of the school to\n\nchange from ninety-one percent black to ninety-six percent black.\n\n“This increment of change in the racial composition of a school\n\nseems unlikely to alter significantly general perceptions of a\n\nschool’s racial identity or the behavior of persons who rely on\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fsuch factors in determining whether or not to send their children\n\nto a particular school.”       Id.9\n\n             Contrary to the district court’s finding, the numbers in\n\nthis case do not prove that the transfers from Hearne to Mumford\n\nreduced desegregation or caused Hearne to transform into a one-race\n\nschool.      Of equal significance, the district court ignored the\n\nrace-neutral impact that transfers of all races has had on Mumford.\n\n             Following the district court’s emphasis, we focus on\n\nHearne first.      At their highest percentage in 2001-2002, 56.67\n\npercent of students attending Hearne were African-American.                 The\n\nlowest percentage of African-American students was 50.71 percent in\n\n1998-99.10      The    district    court’s     exhaustive     discussion     of\n\nmathematical calculations, percentages and percentage points is\n\nrendered moot by this simple comparison, as this court has already\n\nexplained that a change, because of transfers, in percentage of\n\nblack students from fifty percent to sixty percent would be “less\n\nsuspect.”     Eufaula, 573 F.2d at 233 n.9.\n\n\n\n\n      9\n            As will be seen infra, “perceptions alone cannot form the basis for\nfederal court intervention”; actual segregative effect is needed to support a\nfinding that transfers reduce desegregation. See Goodrich, 158 F.3d at 311.\n      10\n              These percentages derive from Trial Exhibit 237, an exhibit the\ndistrict court found reliable and used in its calculations. Trial Exhibit 237\npresents data from 1996 to 2004.     The highest percentage of white students\nattended Hearne in 1996-1997, when 23.50 percent of the student population was\nwhite. The lowest percentage occurred in 2003-2004, when 12.98 percent of the\nstudent population was white. Hearne’s resident population of white students has\nalso fallen, from a high of 26.18 percent in 1998-1999 to a low of 19.41 percent\nin 2003-2004.\n\n                                      13\n\f          The district court also erred because it examined only\n\nthe impact of the transfers on the percentage of black and white\n\nstudents in Hearne, ignoring the substantial and growing portion of\n\nHispanic students.   A central purpose of desegregation decrees was\n\nto prevent, to the extent practicable and not attributable to\n\ndemographic changes, the continued existence of one-race schools.\n\nSee, e.g., Swann v.

Hearne is, however, nowhere\n\nclose to becoming a one-race school, as the largest percentage of\n\nblack students since 1998 has been fifty-six percent.\n\n          Furthermore,   even   by   grouping   blacks   and   Hispanics\n\ntogether as one minority group, the change in population at Hearne\n\nwould not be so significant as to imply a return to segregation.\n\nIn the years 2001-2002 and 2003-2004, when the attendance of white\n\n\n\n\n                                 14\n\fstudents reached its lowest point — approximately thirteen percent11\n\n— the resident population of white students was 22.11 percent and\n\n19.41 percent, respectively.12           These differences are simply not\n\nenough to mark a return to segregation as a result of State action\n\nthrough the transfer funding. See Lee County, 639 F.2d at 1261\n\n(finding it unreasonable “to conclude that this small number of\n\ntransfers effectively perpetuated the segregative effect of earlier\n\nactions”).       Also noteworthy is that TEA cannot be held liable for\n\na decline in Hearne’s white student population caused by a decline\n\nin white residency within the district.\n\n              Accordingly, to the extent that the district court relied\n\non a quantitative analysis to show that white transfers from Hearne\n\nto Mumford were “transforming the district into a predominantly\n\nAfrican-American district when it would not otherwise be so,” its\n\nfindings are clearly erroneous.              To be sure, Hearne’s enrollment\n\n\n      11\n               In 2001-2002, 165 of Hearne’s 1267 students, or 13.02 percent, were\nwhite.

Under the district court’s calculation and subsequent injunction, black\nand Hispanic students could freely transfer from Hearne to Mumford, but white\nstudents would not be allowed. Such an odd result appears to violate the rule\nthat transfers be administered in a nondiscriminatory manner. See Lee v.

Further, even under the district\ncourt’s “white transfers only” analysis, the largest net effect of the transfers\nis a mere 9.97 percentage points, from 22.99 percent to 13.02 percent. Even this\nnumerical difference cannot be found to resegregate Hearne.\n\n                                        15\n\fhas declined for several reasons, including transfers out of the\n\ndistrict.       But Mumford’s acceptance of transfer students of all\n\nraces has produced no segregative effect in Hearne.\n\n            The district court’s findings also fell short by failing\n\nto consider the impact of transfers on Mumford’s racial makeup.\n\nOrder   5281,    as   well   as    above-cited        desegregation       principles,\n\nrequired    a    holistic    look    at    the       transfer   policy’s       impact.\n\nUnsurprisingly,       perhaps,     there       has    plainly   been      no   adverse\n\nconsequence.       Mumford has accepted larger absolute numbers of\n\nminority transfers than white transfers.                  Mumford was and remains\n\na majority-minority district.            Its most recent racial composition\n\nwas fourteen percent black, forty-one percent white and forty-five\n\npercent Hispanic.       Mumford’s growth must be explained by factors\n\nother than an institutional desire to move itself — or Hearne —\n\ntoward one-race status.\n\n            The district court found, qualitatively, that “[t]he\n\ntransfers from Hearne have resulted in members of Hearne and\n\nneighboring communities perceiving Hearne as ‘basically a black\n\nschool district,’ comprising mainly or exclusively black students.”\n\nOf course, “perceptions alone” cannot form the entirety of a\n\nqualitative analysis, Goodrich, 158 F.3d at 311.                    Moreover, the\n\nwitnesses’      perceptions       were    full       of   hearsay   and     illogical\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fconclusions.13 Even if the testimony before the district court were\n\nreliable, the district court never established, as required by\n\nGoodrich, whether such perceptions arose from parents’ private\n\nchoices or State action in the form of TEA-funded transfers.                    See\n\nGoodrich, 158 F.3d at 310-11.            Instead, the district court found\n\nthat    Hearne    does   not     have   unusual    discipline     problems,     and\n\napparently parents would thus have no reason to move or transfer\n\ntheir children from Hearne to Mumford.                  The proper qualitative\n\nanalysis would acknowledge that Mumford has always accepted more\n\nblack and Hispanic transfers than white transfers and has itself\n\nremained a majority-minority district.             TEA’s funding of transfers\n\nhas had no significant net racial impact on either district.\n\n             In sum, the conclusory statements that Hearne is a\n\n“black” school, despite the fact that at no point in the relevant\n\ntime period have black students comprised more than fifty-six\n\npercent     of   the   student    population,     are    not    indicative     of   a\n\nresegregative effect in Hearne.               As in Goodrich, “[b]ecause the\n\ndistrict     court’s     findings       of    segregative      effects   are    too\n\n\n       13\n              The district court relied upon, first, the testimony of Norris\nMcDaniel, Hearne’s former superintendent. McDaniel testified that the perception\nof the Hearne District is one of “just basically a black school district.” He\nbuttressed this conclusion by discussing a conversation he had with a woman who\nhad just moved into the district and noticed that “there were a lot of black\npeople in Hearne.” The district court then accepted the testimony of principal\nCaroline Reed, who was concerned because she saw a lot of white kids playing\nLittle League baseball in Hearne, but her school did not have many white faces.\nShe further testified that her perception of a “predominantly black school” was\none with a majority of African-American students. Finally, the district court\nrelied upon the testimony of Hearne board member James Taylor. Taylor testified\nhe perceived Hearne to be a predominantly black school, in large part because\nHearne’s sports teams were predominantly black.\n\n                                         17\n\fspeculative, not supported by the record, or are rooted in private\n\nconduct rather than state action, they are clearly erroneous and\n\nlegally insufficient.”      Id. at 311.\n\n              Finally, even if the court’s findings that the transfers\n\nhad a resegregative impact were not clearly erroneous, the court’s\n\noverbroad remedy would be an abuse of discretion.              The district\n\ncourt ordered TEA to stop funding all white transfers from Hearne\n\nto Mumford, even if those students had attended Mumford for years.\n\nThis remedy grossly exceeds any possible violation of the original\n\ndesegregation order.\n\n              The facts found by the district court demonstrate that\n\nthe   white    student   population   at   Hearne   declined   to   thirteen\n\npercent, while the black population stood at fifty-six percent.\n\nTEA has refused to fund any new transfers to Mumford as a result of\n\nMumford’s reporting violations and contends that any possible\n\nresegregative effect will be erased by attrition as the baselined\n\nstudents graduate or move.\n\n              We do not comment on the legal merit of TEA’s chosen\n\nsanction for Mumford’s administrative violations. The issue before\n\nus is whether the court’s injunction is among those federal-court\n\ndecrees that “exceed appropriate limits if they are aimed at\n\neliminating a condition that does not violate the Constitution or\n\ndoes not flow from such a violation.”               Milliken v.

The violation here, summed up by the district court\n\nand the Plaintiffs, is that the percentage of white students at one\n\nschool district is declining, and thus “impeding desegregation,”\n\nbecause   those    students    are    transferring        to   another    majority-\n\nminority district.       Yet all TEA did was continue to fund transfer\n\nstudents already attending the receiving district after it learned\n\nthat the one percent guideline had been violated.                           Even if,\n\ncontrary to the foregoing discussion, a violation of Order 5281 had\n\noccurred here, the magnitude of the violation is ambiguous, and the\n\nmotivation of TEA utterly benign.

Mumford\n\n              In addition to enjoining TEA from funding the Hearne-to-\n\nMumford   transfers,         the   district      court    enjoined   Mumford     from\n\naccepting all white transfer students (“without legitimate hardship\n\nexemptions”) from Hearne. The court held that Mumford acted “in\n\nconcert” with TEA in violation of Order 5281 by accepting students\n\nwhose transfers reduced or impeded desegregation in Hearne.                     As we\n\nhave invalidated the district court’s findings and remedial order\n\nconcerning     TEA,    the    injunction        against   Mumford    cannot   stand.\n\nNevertheless, it is necessary to point out serious flaws in the\n\ndistrict court’s analysis lest there be a perception that Mumford\n\nhas been let off the hook notwithstanding its own misconduct.\n\nMumford may not be exposed to liability for violating an order to\n\nwhich it was not a party without evidence of Mumford’s intentional\n\nacts of segregation.         Because the district court did not, and from\n\nthe   facts    could    not,       find   that    Mumford   engaged    in     conduct\n\nintentionally designed to foster racial segregation or to interfere\n\nwith desegregation in Hearne, the injunction against Mumford cannot\n\nstand.\n\n              Based on its finding that Mumford acted “in concert” with\n\nTEA to violate Order 5281, the district court held that Mumford’s\n\nlack of racial or segregative motive was irrelevant so long as the\n\neffect of its conduct violated the Order.                    This was reversible\n\nerror.    This court has long stated that “a federal court cannot\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fimpose liability on individual defendant school districts on the\n\nbasis of a general inverse respondeat superior theory holding them\n\npresumptively responsible for actions of the state or another\n\ngovernmental entity.”              Lee County, 639 F.2d at 1256 (citing and\n\ndiscussing Milliken v.

We reversed,\n\n                                             21\n\foverruling the district court’s reliance on imputed and presumptive\n\ndiscrimination. Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 996. We invalidated\n\na procedure whereby TEA could sanction school districts solely on\n\nthe basis of a numerical trigger:\n\n      [B]y the order of August 1973, the district court\n      established TEA as its agent for purposes of combing the\n      Texas   school  districts   in   search  of   ethnically\n      disproportionate campuses. These the court defined as\n      ones comprising student bodies more than 66 percent\n      minority. On finding one, and without further hearing or\n      inquiry into causation, TEA was to do as it did here:\n      offer the district a choice between accepting a student\n      assignment plan or plans devised by TEA to dilute\n      minority attendance, or suffering the imposition of\n      sanctions calculated to disestablish it.    Relief from\n      either could be had only by the district’s proving its\n      innocence of discriminatory intent in a single and\n      faraway federal court.\n\nId. at 997.    The procedure was fatally flawed, because “[t]o infer\n\ndiscriminatory intent from such slender factual data and act\n\ndecisively upon that inference is to run a high risk of acting\n\nunjustly.”      Id. at 997.         We concluded:          “[T]he ultimate and\n\ndispositive issue is that of the intent with which an autonomous\n\nbody, [the school district], acted in making student assignments.”\n\nId. at 999.     It follows from these authorities that the district\n\ncourt   erred        by     cursorily    dismissing        Mumford’s         lack   of\n\ndiscriminatory intent as irrelevant.\n\n             There    is,    moreover,       no   direct    evidence     condemning\n\nMumford.     Mumford’s “violation” of the one percent guideline found\n\nin   Order    5281    and    used   as   a     trigger     by   TEA    for    further\n\ninvestigation is not indicative of intentional discrimination. The\n\n\n                                         22\n\fFifth Circuit has rejected bare numerical requirements in the\n\ncontext of transfers.       See, e.g., Eufaula, 573 F.2d at 232 & n.6.\n\nAnd, as Gregory-Portland explained, discriminatory intent cannot be\n\npresumed from “such slender factual data.”              Gregory-Portland,\n\n654 F.2d at 997.       The facts surrounding the Hearne-to-Mumford\n\ntransfers demonstrate why a numerical guideline is of so little\n\nimport.     Before it accepted transfer students, Mumford was a tiny\n\nschool district with fewer than sixty students.           Once it started\n\naccepting transfer students, parents of all races began to send\n\ntheir children to Mumford.         The court’s focus on white student\n\ntransfers alone was misplaced, as Mumford has accepted students of\n\nall races whose parents evidently seek educational opportunities of\n\na different nature than those that exist in Hearne.\n\n            The district court faulted the district because it gave\n\nincorrect data to TEA and encouraged parents to claim hardship\n\nexemptions to TEA’s rigid numerical requirements.          As stipulated,\n\nMumford did not provide TEA with transfer data for several years.\n\nThe district court found that this “pattern of fraudulent conduct\n\n. . . demonstrated a consistent and persistent willingness to\n\ncircumvent the requirements of [Order] 5281 whenever possible.”\n\nYet   the   question   is   not   whether    Mumford   complied   with   TEA\n\ndirectives; Mumford must have acted with discriminatory intent in\n\naccepting the transfers.       See Gregory-Portland, 654 F.2d at 999.\n\nMumford’s mishandling of reporting requirements, without more, does\n\nnot prove discriminatory intent.          Accordingly, the district court\n\n                                     23\n\fhad no legal or factual basis to enjoin Mumford from accepting\n\nwhite transfer students.\n\n                            III. CONCLUSION\n\n          Though   it      is   certainly     possible   that   racial\n\ndiscrimination still exists with regard to the treatment of black\n\nstudents in Texas schools, no evidence of segregation or its\n\nvestiges was presented in the instant case.        The battle between\n\nHearne and Mumford is fought for transfer dollars rather than\n\nracial justice.    For the reasons expressed above, the district\n\ncourt’s application of the timeworn Order 5281 was in error.       We\n\ntherefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court, and VACATE\n\nits injunction against Mumford and TEA.\n\n          REVERSED AND VACATED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\f</pre>",
