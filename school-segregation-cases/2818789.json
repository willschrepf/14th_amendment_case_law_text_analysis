Gen. L. ch. 123,   21.<br><br>          6  This initial injunctive relief was obtained because defendants<br>          sequestered Albert  Gagne, beginning on  September 30, 1982.   On<br>          October 22, 1982, plaintiffs' filed a  motion seeking a temporary<br>          restraining  order   and  a  preliminary  injunction  to  prevent<br>          defendants  from continuing  to  sequester plaintiff  Gagne.   On<br>          October  25, the district court denied the motion for a temporary<br>          restraining  order, but  referred  the motion  for a  preliminary<br>          injunction  to a  Magistrate.   Following  a Magistrate's  Report<br>          recommending  that plaintiffs'  motion be  granted in  part since<br>          defendants were violating their own  policies, defendants granted<br>          plaintiff Gagne a hearing before continuing his sequestration.  <br><br>             On September  12, 1983, the  plaintiffs brought  a new  motion<br>          seeking  a  finding  of  contempt, sanctions  and  a  preliminary<br>          injunction.  After numerous evidentiary proceedings, a Magistrate<br><br>                                         -4-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    On  November 19,  1985, following  extensive settlement<br><br>          discussions between the parties and  a suggestion by the district<br><br>          court at a status  conference, defendants filed \"Revised Policies<br><br>          and Procedures\"  (Revised Policies) for the  isolation of inmates<br><br>          at the Treatment Center.<br><br>                    On  April 4,  1986, the  district court issued  a final<br><br>          order  ordering   inter  alia  that  defendants   in  all  future<br>                            _____  ____<br><br>          isolations at the  Treatment Center comply with the  King consent<br>                                                               ____<br><br>          decrees  and the  Revised  Policies.   Defendants  appealed.   In<br><br>          Pearson I, we vacated  the district court's order.   We concluded<br>          _______<br><br>          that  the  district  court had  disposed  of  the  merits of  the<br><br>          controversy without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing and had<br><br>          failed  to make  the necessary  findings to  conclude that,  as a<br><br>          matter of federal law,  the defendants were bound by  the Revised<br><br>          Policies.  The case was remanded and reassigned to Judge Young.7<br><br>          B.  Pearson II<br>          B.  Pearson II<br>              _______<br><br>                    Between  July  and  December  1988,  plaintiffs  sought<br><br>          preliminary injunctive relief against the repeated  isolations of<br><br>          plaintiff Calvin Tate.  <br><br>                    On   July  12,  1988,   plaintiffs  sought  preliminary<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          recommended the denial of plaintiffs' motion.  Other hearings and<br>          further  motions  followed  which  are not  relevant  here.    As<br>          explained  in more detail above,  on April 4,  1986, the district<br>          court  approved the  Magistrate's Report and  Recommendation, and<br>          entered  an  order  binding   the  defendants  to  their  Revised<br>          Policies.<br><br>          7   We note that the  district court granted an  interim award of<br>          attorneys' fees  to  plaintiffs in  the  amount of  $7,379.12  on<br>          February 4, 1988. <br><br>                                         -5-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          injunctive relief  seeking plaintiff Tate's immediate  release on<br><br>          the ground that he was sequestered in a manner which violated the<br><br>          King decrees and the Revised  Policies.  On July 28, 1988,  Judge<br>          ____<br><br>          Young  denied that motion without  prejudice to its renewal after<br><br>          August 15,  1988, if plaintiff  Tate had  not been  released from<br><br>          seclusion  by  that  time.    Although  Judge  Young  found  that<br><br>          plaintiff Tate had \"shown  a reasonable likelihood of  success in<br><br>          proving  that  the Revised  Policies  and  Procedures embody  the<br><br>          procedural due process standards to  which Tate is entitled under<br><br>          the  King decrees,\"  and that the  defendants were  violating the<br>               ____<br><br>          King  decrees,  he concluded  that  the  public interest  --  the<br>          ____<br><br>          defendants' good faith belief that plaintiff Tate was a danger to<br><br>          himself  and others  --  outweighed the  injuries plaintiff  Tate<br><br>          suffered from sequestration.<br><br>                    It  was  not long  before  plaintiffs  returned to  the<br><br>          district  court.  On August  17, 1988, they  renewed their motion<br><br>          for  injunctive relief seeking the release of plaintiff Tate from<br><br>          isolation and  that the defendants refrain  from sequestering any<br><br>          patient  at the  Treatment Center except  in compliance  with the<br><br>          King  decrees  and  the  Revised Policies.    Plaintiffs  further<br>          ____<br><br>          requested inter alia that the district court order <br>                    _____ ____<br><br>                      (1)  the defendants  to  give  a  patient<br>                      facing   sequestration  one   hour  prior<br>                      written  notice   detailing  the  alleged<br>                      behavior  that  led to  the sequestration<br>                      sanction;<br><br>                      (2)   that  any  person  on  the  Special<br>                      Clinical  Staff Conference  (\"SCSC\") [the<br>                      Committee  which  made  the decisions  to<br>                      isolate    inmates]    be   a    licensed<br><br>                                         -6-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                      psychiatrist; <br><br>                      (3)   that   the   treatment   plan   for<br>                      sequestered patients specify why  (i) the<br>                      patient posed \"a clear and present danger<br>                      to himself or others,\" (ii) sequestration<br>                      is  an  clinically  appropriate  form  of<br>                      treatment   and   (iii)  no   other  less<br>                      restrictive   form    of   treatment   is<br>                      appropriate.<br><br>          In response to plaintiffs' motion,  Judge Young held an emergency<br><br>          hearing on August 18, 1988.  Judge Young concluded that the order<br><br>          of  July 22, 1988 --  finding that plaintiffs  had demonstrated a<br><br>          likelihood of success in proving  violations of the King  decrees<br>                                                              ____<br><br>          by  defendants --  should stand.   More importantly,  Judge Young<br><br>          issued  an injunction to take effect on August 26, 1988, ordering<br><br>          defendants <br><br>                      (1)  to  refrain  from  sequestering  any<br>                      patient  except  in  compliance with  the<br>                      King  consent  decrees  and  the  Revised<br>                      ____<br>                      Policies and Procedures;<br><br>                      (2) to include a licensed psychologist in<br>                      the determination of  the SCSC  reviewing<br>                      any  sequestration   and  such  treatment<br>                      review shall indicate the treatment to be<br>                      afforded [to] the person  sequestered and<br>                      how the sequestration contributes  to the<br>                      treatment.<br><br>          Defendants,  however,  chose not  to sit  by  idly and  watch the<br><br>          August 26 injunction  bind them to  their Revised  Policies.   On<br><br>          August  24,  1988,  two  days  before  the  injunction  would  be<br><br>          effective,   the   defendants   released   plaintiff   Tate  from<br><br>          sequestration and they issued a document titled \"Isolation Policy<br><br>          and Procedure\" (\"Isolation Policy\"), which expressly repealed the<br><br>          Revised  Policies.     They  notified  the   district  court  and<br><br><br>                                         -7-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          plaintiffs on August 25.<br><br>                    The Isolation  Policy constituted a broad  expansion of<br><br>          defendants'   discretion   to   sequester   patients.     A   few<br><br>          illustrations  suffice: (1) the  defendants purported to transfer<br><br>          from  the SCSC to the  Administrator of the  Treatment Center and<br><br>          his  Assistant  the   authority  to  make   final  determinations<br><br>          regarding  isolation;  (2) under  the  Policy,  a valid  clinical<br><br>          reason to  continue  the isolation  was  a determination  by  the<br><br>          initial  isolation clinician8  that the  patient would  interfere<br><br>          \"with the orderly  administration of and  treatment goals of  the<br>                    _______  ______________<br><br>          Treatment Center\";  and (3)  the Administrator  had the  power to<br><br>          suspend  the Isolation Policy or parts thereof, if in his opinion<br><br>          there existed \"concerns for  the safety of patients and  staff at<br><br>          the Treatment Center, and/or concerns for the safe administration<br>                                                        ____ ______________<br><br>          of the facility . . . .\" (emphasis added).9  <br><br>                    On   August  24,   1988,  the   same  date   defendants<br><br>          unilaterally replaced the  Revised Policies,  plaintiffs filed  a<br><br>          motion requesting  the  partial modification  of the  preliminary<br><br>          injunction that was  to go into effect on August  26.  Plaintiffs<br><br>          requested that the district court<br><br>                      (1)  specify  that  any further  clinical<br>                      review conducted by defendants concerning<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          8  Initial Isolation Clinician was defined as \"[a] member of  the<br>          [Department of  Mental Health]  clinical staff designated  by the<br>          Administrator  to  evaluate  a patient  who  has  been  placed in<br>          isolation.\"<br><br>          9  In  a post-trial  opinion, the district  court concluded  that<br>          \"the  unilateral adoption  of the  Isolation Policy  violated the<br>          consent decrees . . .\"  Opinion of August 28, 1989, at 98. <br><br>                                         -8-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                      plaintiff Tate shall comply with the King<br>                                                           ____<br>                      consent decrees and  the defendants'  own<br>                      Revised  Policies   and  Procedures;  (2)<br>                      delete  the  provision in  the injunction<br>                      allowing    defendants    to    sequester<br>                      plaintiff Tate by the unilateral decision<br>                      of the Administrator; (3) specify that no<br>                      appeal may be taken from a treatment plan<br>                      except by the patient and the appeal must<br>                      be decided solely  upon materials in  the<br>                      record.<br><br>                    On  August  26,  1988,  Judge  Young  issued  an  order<br><br>          modifying  the preliminary  injunction.   Judge  Young bound  the<br><br>          defendants  to  the  King  consent   decrees  and  to  the  newly<br>                               ____<br><br>          promulgated Isolation Policy, except  that he modified the Policy<br><br>          so that  (1) only  qualified psychiatrists and  psychologists may<br><br>          serve  as  Initial  Isolation  Clinicians  and  Isolation  Review<br><br>          Clinicians; and  (2) the  defendants were barred  from suspending<br><br>          the Isolation Policy, even in an emergency.<br><br>                    Plaintiffs presented their  objections to the Isolation<br><br>          Policy on August 30, 1988 and  requested that the August 26, 1988<br><br>          preliminary injunction  be further  modified (1) to  restrict the<br><br>          use of  isolation to inmates  presenting a likelihood  of serious<br><br>          harm  to   himself  or   others;  (2)  to   allow  administrative<br><br>          modification of a treatment plan  only by a \"legitimate clinician<br><br>          on legitimate clinical grounds only\"; and (3) to measure the time<br><br>          requirements in the Policy by ordinary calendar days, rather than<br><br>          \"working days.\"<br><br>                    On September  22, 1988,  at a status  conference, Judge<br><br>          Young  ordered  the parties  to meet  and  work out  more precise<br><br>          language  for the  Isolation Policy.

They requested<br><br>          that  the  district  court   issue  an  order  further  modifying<br><br>          defendants' Isolation Policy by:<br><br>                      (1)  defining \"isolation,\" as used in the<br>                      Policy,  to mean  the confinement   of  a<br>                      patient  in any place of seclusion, other<br>                      than in his  room for the night  or for a<br>                      security count; <br><br>                      (2)    permitting   the  isolation  of  a<br>                      patient     only      under     emergency<br>                      circumstances,  such   as  the  patient's<br>                      extreme   physical  violence,   attempted<br>                      suicide  or  serious  disruption  of  the<br>                      therapeutic environment, or conduct which<br>                      clearly  demonstrates   the  serious  and<br>                      imminent threat of such behavior.<br><br>          On  November 21,  1988,  following  a  hearing  held  three  days<br><br>          earlier, Judge  Young entered an order  modifying the preliminary<br><br>          injunction of August 26, 1988 by \"[d]efining 'isolation,' as used<br><br>          in the Policy, to mean the confinement of a patient in the Crisis<br><br>          Unit or any  other place  within the institution  other than  the<br><br>          patient's room for more than eight  hours per day.\"  In addition,<br><br>          Judge  Young  adopted   plaintiffs'  proposed  modification  that<br><br>          isolation  be  permitted  only   in  \"emergency  situations\"  and<br><br>                                         -10-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          plaintiffs' definition of \"emergency situations.\" <br><br>                    On January  18, 1989,  Judge Young recused  himself and<br><br>          the case was reassigned to Judge Mazzone.  The case went to trial<br><br>          on  March 16,  1989.10   At trial,  plaintiffs asserted  that the<br><br>          equal protection  clause of the  Constitution required defendants<br><br>          to   comply  with  Massachusetts'  seclusion  and  restraint  law<br><br>          applicable  to  civilly   committed  mental  health   patients.11<br><br>          Plaintiffs  also claimed that the defendants engaged in a pattern<br><br>          and practice of violating the  King decrees, that the defendants'<br>                                         ____<br><br>          sequestration practices violated procedural due  process and that<br><br>          the  conditions of  confinement  failed to  comport with  minimum<br><br>          standards of human decency.<br><br>                    On August 28, 1989, Judge Mazzone dismissed the amended<br><br>          complaint and entered judgment for  defendants.  In a  thoughtful<br><br>          and  comprehensive  opinion,  Judge Mazzone  concluded  that  the<br><br>          plaintiffs had not  succeeded on  any of their  claims at  trial.<br><br>          Judge Mazzone then entered an order vacating the Isolation Policy<br><br>          and staying Judge Young's preliminary injunctions until such time<br><br>          as the  isolation problem  could be comprehensively  addressed in<br><br>          the context of  the King case  (which had been reopened  by Judge<br>                              ____<br><br>          Young).  <br><br>                    Following  their  loss  at trial,  plaintiffs  filed  a<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          10   The Pearson case was consolidated  for trial with Langton v.<br>                   _______                                       _______<br>          Johnson, 928 F.2d 1206 (1st Cir. 1991).

Two  further modifications  proposed by<br><br>          plaintiffs  were adopted  in  large part  by the  district court:<br><br>          administrative  modification of the treatment plan was prohibited<br><br>          unless a  psychiatrist concurred  in writing, and  only qualified<br><br>          psychiatrists and  psychologists may  serve as  Initial Isolation<br><br>          Clinicians and Isolation Review Clinicians.  <br><br>                    In   sum,  Judge   Young  issued   various  preliminary<br><br>          injunctions  in  response  to  plaintiffs'  motions seeking  that<br><br>          defendants be bound to the King decrees and the Revised Policies.<br>                                     ____<br><br>          In the end, it  was clear that plaintiffs' lawsuit  triggered the<br><br>          district court  decision to bind  defendants to the  King decrees<br>                                                               ____<br><br>          and to modify the Isolation Policy to comply with the due process<br><br>          rights of the inmates. <br><br>          B.

Gen. L. ch. 123,   21.<br><br>          6  This initial injunctive relief was obtained because defendants<br>          sequestered Albert  Gagne, beginning on  September 30, 1982.   On<br>          October 22, 1982, plaintiffs' filed a  motion seeking a temporary<br>          restraining  order   and  a  preliminary  injunction  to  prevent<br>          defendants  from continuing  to  sequester plaintiff  Gagne.   On<br>          October  25, the district court denied the motion for a temporary<br>          restraining  order, but  referred  the motion  for a  preliminary<br>          injunction  to a  Magistrate.   Following  a Magistrate's  Report<br>          recommending  that plaintiffs'  motion be  granted in  part since<br>          defendants were violating their own  policies, defendants granted<br>          plaintiff Gagne a hearing before continuing his sequestration.  <br><br>             On September  12, 1983, the  plaintiffs brought  a new  motion<br>          seeking  a  finding  of  contempt, sanctions  and  a  preliminary<br>          injunction.

Defendants  appealed.   In<br><br>          Pearson I, we vacated  the district court's order.   We concluded<br>          _______<br><br>          that  the  district  court had  disposed  of  the  merits of  the<br><br>          controversy without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing and had<br><br>          failed  to make  the necessary  findings to  conclude that,  as a<br><br>          matter of federal law,  the defendants were bound by  the Revised<br><br>          Policies.  The case was remanded and reassigned to Judge Young.7<br><br>          B.  Pearson II<br>          B.  Pearson II<br>              _______<br><br>                    Between  July  and  December  1988,  plaintiffs  sought<br><br>          preliminary injunctive relief against the repeated  isolations of<br><br>          plaintiff Calvin Tate.  <br><br>                    On   July  12,  1988,   plaintiffs  sought  preliminary<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          recommended the denial of plaintiffs' motion.  Other hearings and<br>          further  motions  followed  which  are not  relevant  here.    As<br>          explained  in more detail above,  on April 4,  1986, the district<br>          court  approved the  Magistrate's Report and  Recommendation, and<br>          entered  an  order  binding   the  defendants  to  their  Revised<br>          Policies.<br><br>          7   We note that the  district court granted an  interim award of<br>          attorneys' fees  to  plaintiffs in  the  amount of  $7,379.12  on<br>          February 4, 1988. <br><br>                                         -5-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          injunctive relief  seeking plaintiff Tate's immediate  release on<br><br>          the ground that he was sequestered in a manner which violated the<br><br>          King decrees and the Revised  Policies.  On July 28, 1988,  Judge<br>          ____<br><br>          Young  denied that motion without  prejudice to its renewal after<br><br>          August 15,  1988, if plaintiff  Tate had  not been  released from<br><br>          seclusion  by  that  time.    Although  Judge  Young  found  that<br><br>          plaintiff Tate had \"shown  a reasonable likelihood of  success in<br><br>          proving  that  the Revised  Policies  and  Procedures embody  the<br><br>          procedural due process standards to  which Tate is entitled under<br><br>          the  King decrees,\"  and that the  defendants were  violating the<br>               ____<br><br>          King  decrees,  he concluded  that  the  public interest  --  the<br>          ____<br><br>          defendants' good faith belief that plaintiff Tate was a danger to<br><br>          himself  and others  --  outweighed the  injuries plaintiff  Tate<br><br>          suffered from sequestration.<br><br>                    It  was  not long  before  plaintiffs  returned to  the<br><br>          district  court.  On August  17, 1988, they  renewed their motion<br><br>          for  injunctive relief seeking the release of plaintiff Tate from<br><br>          isolation and  that the defendants refrain  from sequestering any<br><br>          patient  at the  Treatment Center except  in compliance  with the<br><br>          King  decrees  and  the  Revised Policies.    Plaintiffs  further<br>          ____<br><br>          requested inter alia that the district court order <br>                    _____ ____<br><br>                      (1)  the defendants  to  give  a  patient<br>                      facing   sequestration  one   hour  prior<br>                      written  notice   detailing  the  alleged<br>                      behavior  that  led to  the sequestration<br>                      sanction;<br><br>                      (2)   that  any  person  on  the  Special<br>                      Clinical  Staff Conference  (\"SCSC\") [the<br>                      Committee  which  made  the decisions  to<br>                      isolate    inmates]    be   a    licensed<br><br>                                         -6-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                      psychiatrist; <br><br>                      (3)   that   the   treatment   plan   for<br>                      sequestered patients specify why  (i) the<br>                      patient posed \"a clear and present danger<br>                      to himself or others,\" (ii) sequestration<br>                      is  an  clinically  appropriate  form  of<br>                      treatment   and   (iii)  no   other  less<br>                      restrictive   form    of   treatment   is<br>                      appropriate.<br><br>          In response to plaintiffs' motion,  Judge Young held an emergency<br><br>          hearing on August 18, 1988.  Judge Young concluded that the order<br><br>          of  July 22, 1988 --  finding that plaintiffs  had demonstrated a<br><br>          likelihood of success in proving  violations of the King  decrees<br>                                                              ____<br><br>          by  defendants --  should stand.   More importantly,  Judge Young<br><br>          issued  an injunction to take effect on August 26, 1988, ordering<br><br>          defendants <br><br>                      (1)  to  refrain  from  sequestering  any<br>                      patient  except  in  compliance with  the<br>                      King  consent  decrees  and  the  Revised<br>                      ____<br>                      Policies and Procedures;<br><br>                      (2) to include a licensed psychologist in<br>                      the determination of  the SCSC  reviewing<br>                      any  sequestration   and  such  treatment<br>                      review shall indicate the treatment to be<br>                      afforded [to] the person  sequestered and<br>                      how the sequestration contributes  to the<br>                      treatment.<br><br>          Defendants,  however,  chose not  to sit  by  idly and  watch the<br><br>          August 26 injunction  bind them to  their Revised  Policies.   On<br><br>          August  24,  1988,  two  days  before  the  injunction  would  be<br><br>          effective,   the   defendants   released   plaintiff   Tate  from<br><br>          sequestration and they issued a document titled \"Isolation Policy<br><br>          and Procedure\" (\"Isolation Policy\"), which expressly repealed the<br><br>          Revised  Policies.     They  notified  the   district  court  and<br><br><br>                                         -7-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          plaintiffs on August 25.<br><br>                    The Isolation  Policy constituted a broad  expansion of<br><br>          defendants'   discretion   to   sequester   patients.     A   few<br><br>          illustrations  suffice: (1) the  defendants purported to transfer<br><br>          from  the SCSC to the  Administrator of the  Treatment Center and<br><br>          his  Assistant  the   authority  to  make   final  determinations<br><br>          regarding  isolation;  (2) under  the  Policy,  a valid  clinical<br><br>          reason to  continue  the isolation  was  a determination  by  the<br><br>          initial  isolation clinician8  that the  patient would  interfere<br><br>          \"with the orderly  administration of and  treatment goals of  the<br>                    _______  ______________<br><br>          Treatment Center\";  and (3)  the Administrator  had the  power to<br><br>          suspend  the Isolation Policy or parts thereof, if in his opinion<br><br>          there existed \"concerns for  the safety of patients and  staff at<br><br>          the Treatment Center, and/or concerns for the safe administration<br>                                                        ____ ______________<br><br>          of the facility . . . .\" (emphasis added).9  <br><br>                    On   August  24,   1988,  the   same  date   defendants<br><br>          unilaterally replaced the  Revised Policies,  plaintiffs filed  a<br><br>          motion requesting  the  partial modification  of the  preliminary<br><br>          injunction that was  to go into effect on August  26.  Plaintiffs<br><br>          requested that the district court<br><br>                      (1)  specify  that  any further  clinical<br>                      review conducted by defendants concerning<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          8  Initial Isolation Clinician was defined as \"[a] member of  the<br>          [Department of  Mental Health]  clinical staff designated  by the<br>          Administrator  to  evaluate  a patient  who  has  been  placed in<br>          isolation.\"<br><br>          9  In  a post-trial  opinion, the district  court concluded  that<br>          \"the  unilateral adoption  of the  Isolation Policy  violated the<br>          consent decrees . . .\"  Opinion of August 28, 1989, at 98. <br><br>                                         -8-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                      plaintiff Tate shall comply with the King<br>                                                           ____<br>                      consent decrees and  the defendants'  own<br>                      Revised  Policies   and  Procedures;  (2)<br>                      delete  the  provision in  the injunction<br>                      allowing    defendants    to    sequester<br>                      plaintiff Tate by the unilateral decision<br>                      of the Administrator; (3) specify that no<br>                      appeal may be taken from a treatment plan<br>                      except by the patient and the appeal must<br>                      be decided solely  upon materials in  the<br>                      record.<br><br>                    On  August  26,  1988,  Judge  Young  issued  an  order<br><br>          modifying  the preliminary  injunction.   Judge  Young bound  the<br><br>          defendants  to  the  King  consent   decrees  and  to  the  newly<br>                               ____<br><br>          promulgated Isolation Policy, except  that he modified the Policy<br><br>          so that  (1) only  qualified psychiatrists and  psychologists may<br><br>          serve  as  Initial  Isolation  Clinicians  and  Isolation  Review<br><br>          Clinicians; and  (2) the  defendants were barred  from suspending<br><br>          the Isolation Policy, even in an emergency.<br><br>                    Plaintiffs presented their  objections to the Isolation<br><br>          Policy on August 30, 1988 and  requested that the August 26, 1988<br><br>          preliminary injunction  be further  modified (1) to  restrict the<br><br>          use of  isolation to inmates  presenting a likelihood  of serious<br><br>          harm  to   himself  or   others;  (2)  to   allow  administrative<br><br>          modification of a treatment plan  only by a \"legitimate clinician<br><br>          on legitimate clinical grounds only\"; and (3) to measure the time<br><br>          requirements in the Policy by ordinary calendar days, rather than<br><br>          \"working days.\"<br><br>                    On September  22, 1988,  at a status  conference, Judge<br><br>          Young  ordered  the parties  to meet  and  work out  more precise<br><br>          language  for the  Isolation Policy.   More  significantly, Judge<br><br><br>                                         -9-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Young adopted  two of plaintiffs' three  suggested amendments: he<br><br>          ordered  that  modification  of   an  initial  clinical  decision<br><br>          requiring isolation be made only with the written  concurrence of<br><br>          a psychiatrist or  psychologist, and he amended the definition of<br><br>          \"days\"  as  used in  the  Policy  to  mean  \"all days,  not  just<br><br>          workdays.\"<br><br>                    On  November 4,  1988,  plaintiffs filed  a motion  for<br><br>          modification of the preliminary injunction in response to another<br><br>          allegedly unlawful  isolation of plaintiff Tate.   They requested<br><br>          that  the  district  court   issue  an  order  further  modifying<br><br>          defendants' Isolation Policy by:<br><br>                      (1)  defining \"isolation,\" as used in the<br>                      Policy,  to mean  the confinement   of  a<br>                      patient  in any place of seclusion, other<br>                      than in his  room for the night  or for a<br>                      security count; <br><br>                      (2)    permitting   the  isolation  of  a<br>                      patient     only      under     emergency<br>                      circumstances,  such   as  the  patient's<br>                      extreme   physical  violence,   attempted<br>                      suicide  or  serious  disruption  of  the<br>                      therapeutic environment, or conduct which<br>                      clearly  demonstrates   the  serious  and<br>                      imminent threat of such behavior.<br><br>          On  November 21,  1988,  following  a  hearing  held  three  days<br><br>          earlier, Judge  Young entered an order  modifying the preliminary<br><br>          injunction of August 26, 1988 by \"[d]efining 'isolation,' as used<br><br>          in the Policy, to mean the confinement of a patient in the Crisis<br><br>          Unit or any  other place  within the institution  other than  the<br><br>          patient's room for more than eight  hours per day.\"  In addition,<br><br>          Judge  Young  adopted   plaintiffs'  proposed  modification  that<br><br>          isolation  be  permitted  only   in  \"emergency  situations\"  and<br><br>                                         -10-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          plaintiffs' definition of \"emergency situations.\" <br><br>                    On January  18, 1989,  Judge Young recused  himself and<br><br>          the case was reassigned to Judge Mazzone.  The case went to trial<br><br>          on  March 16,  1989.10   At trial,  plaintiffs asserted  that the<br><br>          equal protection  clause of the  Constitution required defendants<br><br>          to   comply  with  Massachusetts'  seclusion  and  restraint  law<br><br>          applicable  to  civilly   committed  mental  health   patients.11<br><br>          Plaintiffs  also claimed that the defendants engaged in a pattern<br><br>          and practice of violating the  King decrees, that the defendants'<br>                                         ____<br><br>          sequestration practices violated procedural due  process and that<br><br>          the  conditions of  confinement  failed to  comport with  minimum<br><br>          standards of human decency.<br><br>                    On August 28, 1989, Judge Mazzone dismissed the amended<br><br>          complaint and entered judgment for  defendants.  In a  thoughtful<br><br>          and  comprehensive  opinion,  Judge Mazzone  concluded  that  the<br><br>          plaintiffs had not  succeeded on  any of their  claims at  trial.<br><br>          Judge Mazzone then entered an order vacating the Isolation Policy<br><br>          and staying Judge Young's preliminary injunctions until such time<br><br>          as the  isolation problem  could be comprehensively  addressed in<br><br>          the context of  the King case  (which had been reopened  by Judge<br>                              ____<br><br>          Young).  <br><br>                    Following  their  loss  at trial,  plaintiffs  filed  a<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          10   The Pearson case was consolidated  for trial with Langton v.<br>                   _______                                       _______<br>          Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"557986\"><a href=\"/opinion/557986/william-langton-v-philip-johnston-john-bruder-john-bruder-v-philip/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991).

Additionally,  the<br><br>          district  court  adopted   plaintiffs'  suggested  definition  of<br><br>          \"isolation,\" adding only the  requirement that confinement be for<br><br>          more than  eight hours.   Two  further modifications  proposed by<br><br>          plaintiffs  were adopted  in  large part  by the  district court:<br><br>          administrative  modification of the treatment plan was prohibited<br><br>          unless a  psychiatrist concurred  in writing, and  only qualified<br><br>          psychiatrists and  psychologists may  serve as  Initial Isolation<br><br>          Clinicians and Isolation Review Clinicians.  <br><br>                    In   sum,  Judge   Young  issued   various  preliminary<br><br>          injunctions  in  response  to  plaintiffs'  motions seeking  that<br><br>          defendants be bound to the King decrees and the Revised Policies.<br>                                     ____<br><br>          In the end, it  was clear that plaintiffs' lawsuit  triggered the<br><br>          district court  decision to bind  defendants to the  King decrees<br>                                                               ____<br><br>          and to modify the Isolation Policy to comply with the due process<br><br>          rights of the inmates. <br><br>          B.

Hensley,  461  U.S.   at  588.<br>                                             _______<br><br>          Accordingly, we  have applied our \"billing  judgment\" to disallow<br><br>          unreasonable claims.19  <br><br>                    We  have also  reduced the number  of hours  claimed to<br><br>          adjust for overstaffing.   Exhibit B of  plaintiffs' motion shows<br><br>          that approximately 15 lawyers billed hours for work  performed on<br><br>          this case.  This  is an unreasonable number  of lawyers.   Courts<br><br>          \"should  ordinarily  greet  a  claim that  several  lawyers  were<br><br>          required  to  perform  a   single  set  of  tasks  with   healthy<br><br>          skepticism.\"  Lipsett v. Blanco, No. 91-2152, slip. op. at 8 (1st<br>                        _______    ______<br><br>          Cir. Sept.  23, 1992).   It is  conceivable that  a civil  rights<br><br>          litigation may  be so complex and novel that a plaintiff may have<br><br>          to retain more than  15 skilled civil rights lawyers  to succeed.<br><br>          But this  is not  such a case.   At  the time  the complaint  was<br><br>          filed, defendants  were  in  theory  bound by  the  King  consent<br>                                                              ____<br><br>          decrees and  they had  promulgated policies  which on their  face<br><br>          complied with the decrees.   In simple terms, the  vindication of<br><br>          plaintiffs' rights was to  a large extent a matter  of clarifying<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>          19   For example,  plaintiffs' counsel seeks  $15,105.11 for  the<br>          preparation of the first motion for award of attorneys' fees.  <br><br>                                         -24-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          the consent decrees, which did not require overreaching to assert<br><br>          tenuous constitutional claims.20<br><br>                    Likewise, the high  hourly rates billed by  plaintiffs'<br><br>          law firm \"presuppose particular familiarity and  expertise, which<br><br>          should reduce\" the number  of attorneys needed to litigate.

This<br>          ________                    ________ _____<br><br>          is  particularly  so  here  where plaintiffs'  two  lead  counsel<br><br>          conducted   most,  if   not  all,   stages  of   the  litigation.<br><br>          Ultimately,  plaintiffs have  failed to  articulate a  compelling<br><br>          reason as to why  defendants should be taxed for  the duplicative<br><br>          costs  of associating  a horde  of attorneys  with this  dispute.<br><br>          Finally,  plaintiffs'  counsel,   by  overreaching   (continually<br><br>          pushing for full fees  in the face of very limited success), have<br><br>          forfeited any claim on appellate  generosity.
