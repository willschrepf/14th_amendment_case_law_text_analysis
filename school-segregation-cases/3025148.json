See Dkt. 1 at 1 (Compl. ¶ 2). At the time\n\nshe began work at APHIS, Plaintiff was approximately 53 years old. See id. She alleges that, in\n\nthe course of her employment, the USDA discriminated against her on the basis of her race, sex,\n\nand age. Id. at 2 (Compl. ¶ 4). Her complaint includes claims of disparate treatment, a hostile\n\nwork environment, and retaliation. Id. at 2–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 7–18).\n\n       The USDA has moved to dismiss on multiple grounds. See Dkt. 12. It contends that\n\nseveral of Plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed on the basis of her failure timely to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies; that Plaintiff did not suffer any “adverse personnel action” within the\n\nmeaning of the antidiscrimination laws; that Plaintiff has failed to alleged facts that, even if taken\n\nas true, would rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness required to establish the existence of a\n\nhostile work environment; that Plaintiff’s challenges to the manner in which USDA processed\n\fher administrative complaint do not state a claim; and that 42 U.S.C. § 1981 does not provide a\n\ncause of action for claims against federal agencies for employment discrimination.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that USDA has not carried its\n\nburden of demonstrating that Plaintiff failed timely to exhaust her claims. The Court further\n\nconcludes, however, that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to establish that Plaintiff\n\nsuffered a cognizable adverse employment action or that she was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment. Finally, the Court concludes that the alleged deficiencies in the administrative\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity process are not actionable and that Section 1981 does not apply\n\nto claims of employment discrimination in the federal workforce.\n\n       The Court, accordingly, GRANTS USDA’s motion (Dkt. 12) and dismisses the\n\ncomplaint without prejudice.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n       As an initial matter, the Court must decide which factual allegations are properly before\n\nthe Court. Plaintiff’s five-count complaint is a mere six pages long, and it contains few non-\n\nconclusory factual allegations. Dkt. 1 at 1–6. It is accompanied, however, by over 40 pages of\n\nexhibits, including email and other correspondence, a newspaper article, and, more helpfully,\n\nPlaintiff’s May 1, 2009 administrative complaint and the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission’s (“EEOC”) final decision regarding that complaint. Id. at 8–55.\n\n       In adjudicating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may consider,\n\nalong with the facts alleged in the complaint, “any documents either attached to or incorporated\n\nin the complaint and matters” subject to “judicial notice.” EEOC v. St. Francis Xavier Parochial\n\nSch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997). Moreover, pro se pleadings should be “liberally\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fconstrued” and “pro se litigants are held to a lesser pleading standard than other parties.” Fed.\n\nExp. Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402 (2008). At the same time, however, “[e]ven pro se\n\nlitigants . . . must comply with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,” Butler v. Cal. State\n\nDisbursement Unit, 990 F. Supp. 2d 8, 8–9 (D.D.C. 2013), and courts are not responsible for\n\nhunting through the record in search of material potentially helpful to a party’s case, United\n\nStates ex rel. El-Amin v. George Washington Univ., 533 F. Supp. 2d 12, 20 (D.D.C. 2008).\n\nIndeed, where undifferentiated documents are submitted along with a complaint that is itself\n\nlacking in detail, asking the Court to comb through the attachments to discern the substance of\n\nthe plaintiff’s claims risks placing it more in the role of advocate than judge and risks denying\n\nthe defendant fair notice and an opportunity to respond to identifiable allegations of wrongdoing.\n\n       When Plaintiff’s complaint in this action is read in combination with her administrative\n\ncomplaints, 1 the Court is able to discern the following factual allegations on which she premises\n\nher claims. Importantly, USDA has identified these same factual allegations in its motion to\n\ndismiss, see Dkt. 12-1 at 1–2, and does not dispute that these allegations should be taken as true\n\nfor purposes of the pending motion, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Relying on\n\nthese materials, moreover, does not require the Court to pick through emails and other\n\ndocuments in search of a claim. The relevant allegations are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n1\n In addition to Plaintiff’s May 1, 2009 administrative complaint, the Court will consider her\nMarch 10, 2009 administrative complaint, which is attached to USDA’s motion to dismiss, see\nDkt. 12-2, because it is referenced in Exhibit A to Plaintiff’s complaint and because, like the\nMay 1, 2009 administrative complaint submitted by Plaintiff, it is subject to judicial notice as an\nofficial document that is part of the record of the administrative process. See Laughlin v. Holder,\n923 F. Supp. 2d 204, 209 (D.D.C. 2013); see also St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d at\n624 (court may consider “matters of which [it] may take judicial notice” on a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion without converting the motion to a Rule 56 motion).\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        Plaintiff began employment at APHIS in October 2007, where she worked as an\n\ninvestigator for the Investigative and Enforcement Services (“IES”) division. Dkt. 12-2 at 1.\n\nShe is an African-American female who was approximately 53 years old when she started work\n\nat APHIS. Dkt. 1 at 1 (Compl. ¶ 2). Problems began almost immediately upon her arrival. At\n\nthat time, she was given a large caseload, including the “backlog of more than 100\n\ndelinquent/neglected cases” that previously had been assigned to a younger, Caucasian\n\nemployee. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8); Dkt. 12-2 at 3, 8. To make matters worse, according to\n\nPlaintiff, she was not provided any training or guidance regarding how to process the cases. Dkt.\n\n1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8). When she sought guidance, Plaintiff—unlike other employees—was told\n\n“not to ask work-related questions” of other employees and “not to send e-mail messages” with\n\nquestions. Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶ 13). Instead, she was relegated to posing her questions by writing\n\nthem on pieces of paper and bringing them to her supervisor’s “desk for responses.” Id.\n\n        Plaintiff further alleges that USDA adopted a “no tolerance” policy with respect to her\n\nwork and her ability to process her caseload within “stringent guidelines.” Id. at 2–3 (Compl.\n\n¶¶ 7–8). Others, including the younger, Caucasian employee from whom Plaintiff inherited the\n\nlarge backlog of unprocessed cases, were not held to this stringent standard. Id. at 3 (Compl.\n\n¶ 8). Indeed, that employee received “multiple, favorable career opportunities,” despite the fact\n\nthat she “complained and failed to process her . . . workload in compliance with office policies.”\n\nId. (Compl. ¶ 9). When Plaintiff “expressed any workplace concerns, USDA harassed” her,\n\nincluding by “taking the liberty to search for personal data about [P]laintiff’s eligible date to\n\nretire” and using “that date as part of its resolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire” before “her\n\nanticipate[d] date.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f       More generally, the complaint alleges that USDA applied a “double standard[]” to\n\nPlaintiff relative to “two . . . Caucasian female[]” employees and a “Caucasian male” employee.\n\nId at 2 (Compl. ¶ 7). USDA, for example, “failed to timely resolve recurring complaints of\n\ninappropriate behavior and sexual harassment” involving the Caucasian male employee, while\n\n“quickly redressing any issue” regarding Plaintiff. Id. at 3 (Compl. ¶ 11). According to Plaintiff,\n\nthis differential treatment, including the requirement that she meet productivity standards that\n\nwere not applied to others, USDA’s failure to provide training, and the special rules that applied\n\nto her alone for asking questions were motivated by her race, sex, and age. Id. at 2 (Compl. ¶ 4).\n\nB. Administrative Proceedings\n\n       On March 10, 2009, Plaintiff faxed an Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”)\n\ncomplaint detailing her claims of workplace discrimination to a USDA EEO counselor. Dkt. 1 at\n\n13; Dkt. 12-2. In that document, Plaintiff states that she “consulted with the USDA-EEO\n\nCounselor” on February 6, 2009, and that she subsequently filed an EEO complaint on February\n\n10, 2009. Dkt 12-2 at 1. The February 10 EEO complaint does not appear in the record. On\n\nMay 1, 2009, Plaintiff lodged another EEO complaint with USDA, which does appear in the\n\nrecord. See Dkt. 1 at 13–14.\n\n       On June 30, 2009, Lauren Hill, an Employment Complaints Manager in the Civil Rights\n\nEnforcement and Compliance Office of APHIS, sent Plaintiff a proposal for resolution of her\n\nEEO complaint, offering that the Plaintiff take her annual leave, paid in advance, until she\n\nbecame eligible for retirement on August 15, 2009. Id. at 11. Hill also apparently\n\ncommunicated with Plaintiff’s “personal representative” in March and April 2010 regarding a\n\nproposed resolution. Id. at 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       From March 2010 to August 2013, Plaintiff and her personal representative transmitted\n\nletters and emails to various USDA officials describing her dissatisfaction with the\n\nadministrative process. See Dkt. 1 at 16, 23, 35, 39, 41, 43, 55. In the letters, Plaintiff asserted\n\nthat there were multiple players in the process whose roles she did not understand, id. at 16; that\n\nthe EEO adjudicators had identified and pursued claims that did not relate to her complaints and\n\nhad excluded other allegations for which she had obtained counseling, id. at 16, 25, 36; that she\n\nfelt bullied by an investigator, id. at 16; that the investigators did not speak with or obtain\n\naffidavits or declarations from any of her witnesses, id. at 17, 24–25, 43, 55; and that she was not\n\noffered Alternative Dispute Resolution, id. at 35. On May 20, 2010, Plaintiff’s personal\n\nrepresentative received the agency’s Report of Investigation, id. at 24, although that report does\n\nnot appear in the record. In an email to a USDA official dated November 4, 2010, Plaintiff\n\nexplained that she had decided to retire from USDA because of “unresolved issues” regarding\n\n“the hostile work conditions and harassment” and the EEO administrative process. Id. at 17.\n\n       USDA issued a Final Agency Decision with “no finding of discrimination” on February\n\n7, 2011. Id. at 37. On appeal, the EEOC ruled in favor of USDA on December 27, 2012. Id.\n\nNeither of these decisions appear in the record. At least twice in 2012, and possibly as many as\n\nfive times, Plaintiff petitioned the EEOC to remand her case back to USDA, alleging that the\n\nagency had failed properly to process her administrative complaints. Id. at 27, 32. The EEOC\n\ndenied a request for reconsideration on July 16, 2013. Id. at 53. Finally, on September 16, 2013,\n\nthe Director of USDA’s Office of Adjudication responded to a letter from Plaintiff’s personal\n\nrepresentative about Plaintiff’s concerns regarding the administrative process, stating that “[a]s\n\nall administrative appeals have been exhausted in [Plaintiff’s] complaint, we can offer no further\n\nremedy.” Id. at 37.\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fC. The Present Lawsuit\n\n       Plaintiff filed this case on September 30, 2013, Dkt. 1, within the 90-day period\n\nauthorized following the EEOC’s final decision denying reconsideration, id. at 52–54. The\n\ncomplaint contains five counts:\n\n       Counts I, II, and III are based on the allegations outlined above about differential\n\ntreatment, including the requirement that Plaintiff meet productivity standards that were not\n\napplied to others, USDA’s failure to provide training, and the special rules that applied to her\n\nalone for posing questions. Id. at 2–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 7–13).\n\n       In Count III, the Plaintiff also alleges that USDA identified claims for investigation that\n\n“excluded [Plaintiff’s] alleged harassment claims for which [P]laintiff was counseled” and\n\n“failed to use its own policies to execute imminent remedial action to secure plaintiff’s rights . . .\n\nto work in a healthy harassment-free environment.” Id. at 3–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12).\n\n       In Count IV, Plaintiff repeats the allegation that USDA failed to investigate certain\n\nclaims for which she was counseled, describing the excluded claims only as “hostile work\n\nconditions claims.” Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶ 14).\n\n       In Count V, labeled “retaliation claims,” Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) violated\n\nPlaintiff’s “due process rights by failing to process her grievance” in accordance with 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614; (2) “failed to cure the discrepancies, errors, and record issues prior to forwarding” the\n\nmatter to the EEOC; and (3) “failed to investigate [Plaintiff’s] claims” within the 180-day time\n\nperiod provided for in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108. Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 17, 18). Plaintiff also\n\nalleges that she “began seeking justice at the earliest possible juncture of the administrative\n\nforum.” Id. (Compl. ¶ 16).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       USDA contends that Plaintiff’s complaint should be dismissed on the grounds that (1)\n\nPlaintiff failed timely to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) Plaintiff has failed to allege an\n\nadverse employment action with respect to Counts I and II; (3) Plaintiff has failed to allege\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive conditions to constitute a hostile work environment in Count III;\n\n(4) Plaintiff’s allegations in Count IV and V pertaining to the administrative process do not\n\nsupport an actionable claim; and (5) Plaintiff cannot state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nbecause Title VII provides an exclusive remedy against a federal agency for race-based\n\nemployment discrimination. See Dkt. 12.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Exhaustion\n\n       USDA first asserts that Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed on the basis of her failure\n\nto exhaust her administrative remedies. The EEOC has promulgated detailed regulations\n\nestablishing administrative procedures for the resolution of employment discrimination claims\n\nagainst federal agencies. A Title VII complainant must timely exhaust these administrative\n\nproceedings before filing suit in federal court, although the limits are not jurisdictional and “are\n\nsubject to equitable tolling, estoppel, and waiver.” Bowden v. United States, 106 F.3d 433, 437\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997). The D.C. Circuit has summarized the procedures applicable to Title VII claims\n\nas follows:\n\n       Under Title VII, employees who believe they have been discriminated against\n       must first consult an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor within 45\n       days of the alleged discriminatory acts. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). Should the\n       employee and the Counselor fail to resolve the discrimination claim within 30\n       days, the Counselor sends the employee a notice explaining the administrative\n       complaint procedure. Id. § 1614.105(d). The employee then has 15 days to file\n       an individual and/or class complaint with the employing agency. Id. § 1614.106\n       (regulations governing individual complaints); id. § 1614.204 (regulations\n       governing class complaints); see also id. § 1614.103 (noting types of complaints\n       governed by agency processing procedures outlined in regulations). Upon receipt\n\n                                                  8\n\f            of a final agency decision—known as a “FAD”—disposing of the administrative\n            complaints, the employee has either 30 days to appeal to the Equal Employment\n            Opportunity Commission (EEOC), id. §§ 1614.401(a), 1614.402(a), or 90 days to\n            file suit in federal court, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c).\n\nIn re James, 444 F.3d 643, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “Exhaustion is required in order to give federal\n\nagencies an opportunity to handle matters internally whenever possible and to ensure that the\n\nfederal courts are burdened only when reasonably necessary.” Brown v. Marsh, 777 F.2d 8, 14\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). USDA contends that Plaintiff’s claims must be dismissed for lack of\n\nadministrative exhaustion because (1) she “failed to timely initiate an EEO claim within the\n\nrequired 45-day period for her discrimination claims arising in 2007 and 2008,” Dkt. 12-1 at 4;\n\nand (2) she failed to initiate any EEO counseling for discrimination claims arising in June 2009,\n\nid. at 5.\n\n         An initial clarification is in order. In its brief, USDA asserts that Plaintiff failed to\n\n“initiate an EEO claim within the 45-day period,” id. at 4 (emphasis added), that she “initiated\n\nEEO counseling on February 9, 2009,” and that “[f]or her claims to be timely, Plaintiff must\n\nhave reached out to the EEO by December 23, 2008 (45 days from February 9, 2009, counting\n\nbackward),” id. at 6. The 45-day deadline, however, pertains to the initiation of EEO counseling\n\nafter the allegedly discriminatory action, and not to the filing of a claim. See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.105(a)(1) (requiring aggrieved person to “initiate contact with a counselor within 45 days\n\nof the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within\n\n45 days of the effective date of the action”). Thus, December 23, 2008—the date calculated by\n\nUSDA—reflects the earliest date on which a discrete act of discrimination for which EEO\n\ncounseling was initiated on February 6, 2009, could have occurred in order for Plaintiff’s claim\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fto be timely—not the date on which Plaintiff was required to file an EEO claim (or to “reach[]\n\nout to the EEO,” Dkt. 12-1 at 6). 2\n\n       USDA’s non-exhaustion defense faces two significant difficulties, both based on the fact\n\nthat failure to exhaust is a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense and thus “the defendant bears\n\nthe burden of pleading and proving it.” Bowden, 106 F.3d at 437; see also Brown, 777 F.2d at\n\n13; Dick v. Holder, 80 F. Supp. 3d 103, 111 (D.D.C. 2015); Koch v. Schapiro, 699 F. Supp. 2d 3,\n\n12 (D.D.C. 2010). It is only after the defendant meets this burden that the burden shifts to the\n\nplaintiff to plead and prove “facts supporting equitable avoidance of the defense.” Bowden, 106\n\nF.3d at 437; see also Smith-Haynie v. District of Columbia, 155 F.3d 575, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n\n(“[A]n affirmative defense may be raised by pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b) when the facts\n\nthat give rise to the defense are clear from the face of the complaint.” (emphasis added)).\n\n       1.   ADEA Exhaustion\n\n       USDA’s first problem is that it frames its non-exhaustion defense solely in response to\n\nPlaintiff’s Title VII claims, and it relies solely on the rules applicable to Title VII cases. Dkt. 12-\n\n1 at 4–8; Dkt. 15 at 2–3. In addition to alleging violations of Title VII, however, Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint also alleges a violation of her rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. Dkt. 1 at 2. The procedures applicable under the two\n\nstatutes, moreover, are not identical. In particular, the ADEA gives federal employees two\n\noptions for seeking judicial review. First, unlike in Title VII cases, “the employee may bring a\n\nclaim directly to federal court so long as, within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory act,\n\n\n\n2\n   Although USDA’s brief states that Plaintiff “initiated EEO counseling on February 9, 2009,”\nDkt. 12-1 at 6, it apparently calculated the 45-day period from February 6, 2009—the date on\nwhich the document submitted by Defendant indicates that Plaintiff engaged in EEO counseling.\nId. at 1. The “February 9, 2009” date in USDA’s brief appears to be a typographical error.\n\n                                                  10\n\f[she] provides the EEOC with notice of [her] intent to sue at least 30 days before commencing\n\nsuit.” Rann v. Chao, 346 F.3d 192, 195 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Alternatively, “the employee may\n\ninvoke the EEOC’s administrative process, and then sue if dissatisfied with the results.” Id.\n\nHere, all of USDA’s arguments are directed at the second of these options—which is also the\n\nmeans of exhausting a Title VII claim. See Dkt. 12-1 at 4–8; Dkt. 15 at 2–3; see also Brown v.\n\nGen. Servs. Admin., 425 U.S. 820, 832 (1976) (describing Title VII exhaustion requirements).\n\nDefendant’s motion makes no mention of whether Plaintiff has complied with the first option for\n\nobtaining judicial review of an ADEA claim.\n\n       To be sure, Plaintiff has not alleged that she provided the prescribed intent-to-sue notice\n\nto the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory acts, as required under the first\n\noption, or that she waited at least 30 days after doing so to commence suit. Indeed, the record\n\nbefore the Court does not contain any suggestion that she complied with these requirements. The\n\nallocation of the burden of proof is, however, dispositive here. The D.C. Circuit and other\n\njudges on this Court have repeatedly treated failure to comply with the timeliness and exhaustion\n\nrequirements of the ADEA as a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense on which the defendant\n\nbears the burden of proof. See Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. United States, 614 F.3d\n\n519, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“[N]either Title VII nor the ADEA incorporates a jurisdictional\n\nexhaustion requirement.”); Kennedy v. Whitehurst, 690 F.2d 951, 961 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“[T]he\n\ntimeliness and exhaustion requirements [of ADEA] are not jurisdictional in nature but rather are\n\nstatutory conditions precedent to the instigation of litigation and are therefore subject to waiver,\n\nestoppel, and equitable tolling.”); see also Latson v. Holder, 82 F. Supp. 3d 377, 386 (D.D.C.\n\n2015); Dick, 80 F. Supp. 3d at 110–11; Koch, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 12. Cf. Rann, 346 F.3d at 195\n\n(noting some uncertainty regarding application of the jurisdictional label in some contexts). As\n\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fthe district court explained in Singleton v. Potter, 402 F. Supp. 2d 12 (D.D.C. 2005), “the\n\nadministrative deadlines imposed by [the ADEA] are not jurisdictional in nature,” but rather\n\n“‘function like a statute of limitations, and, like a statute of limitations, are subject to waiver,\n\nestoppel, and equitable tolling.’” Id. at 33 (quoting Brown, 777 F.2d at 14).\n\n        Nor is there any reason to conclude that the two paths for seeking judicial review under\n\nthe ADEA should be treated differently in this regard. That is, if the option of invoking the\n\nEEOC administrative process is a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense, as the Court of Appeals\n\nand other judges in this district have held, there is no reason to conclude that the option of\n\nnotifying the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act, and then waiting 30 days\n\nbefore bringing suit, should be treated differently. Indeed, the option of filing a notice with the\n\nEEOC within 180 days seems, if anything, more analogous to a statute of limitations than the\n\noption of complying with the EEOC administrative process. The Court, accordingly, concludes\n\nthat the burden of pleading and demonstrating that Plaintiff failed to comply with either path to\n\njudicial review rested with USDA. Because USDA failed entirely to address the separate ADEA\n\nframework, its motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s suit for failure to exhaust must be denied as to\n\nPlaintiff’s ADEA claims. 3\n\n\n\n3\n   The D.C. Circuit has left open whether, having invoked the second path to judicial review by\nfiling an EEO complaint, the plaintiff “must reasonably pursue the [administrative] process, as\nan exhaustion requirement would ordinarily entail,” Rann, 346 F.3d at 195–96 (emphasis in\noriginal). Similarly, in Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U.S. 1, 5–9 (1991), the Supreme\nCourt held that the petitioner had properly provided the EEOC with notice of its intent to sue—\nthat is, it had complied with the first path to judicial review. The Court then declined to reach\nthe issue of whether, having filed an EEO complaint, the petitioner was also required to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Id. at 9–10. The Supreme Court explained that the matter was not\nproperly before it in light of the Solicitor General’s position that “a federal employee who elects\nagency review of an age discrimination claim need not exhaust his administrative remedies\nbefore bringing a civil action.” Id. at 9. Other judges of this Court, however, have dismissed\nADEA claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the plaintiff filed an EEO\ncomplaint but failed to comply with the 45-day counseling requirement. See, e.g., Koch v.\n                                                   12\n\f       2. Title VII Exhaustion\n\n       Although a closer question, the Court is also unpersuaded that USDA has carried its\n\nburden of demonstrating that Plaintiff’s Title VII claims should be dismissed on exhaustion\n\ngrounds. Again, the Court’s conclusion turns on the premise that USDA bears the burden of\n\ndemonstrating that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies in a timely manner.\n\nBowden, 106 F.3d at 437; see also Brown, 777 F.2d at 13. Where a plaintiff alleges “discrete\n\nacts” of discrimination, she “can only file a charge to cover [those] discrete acts that ‘occurred’\n\nwithin the appropriate time period,” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114\n\n(2002)—here, 45 days before the initiation of EEO counseling. By contrast, “[a] charge alleging\n\na hostile work environment claim . . . will not be time barred so long as all acts which constitute\n\nthe claim are part of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one act falls within the\n\ntime period.” Id. at 122. 4\n\n       Based on Plaintiff’s statement in her March 10, 2009 EEO Complaint that she “consulted\n\nwith the USDA-EEO Counselor” on February 6, 2009, Dkt. 12-2 at 1, USDA asserts that\n\nPlaintiff failed to initiate EEO counseling prior to that date, id. at 6. Then, USDA contends that\n\n\n\nWalter, 935 F. Supp. 2d 143, 153 (D.D.C. 2013); Rodriguez v. Donovan, 922 F. Supp. 2d 11, 16–\n17 (D.D.C. 2013). Here, even assuming without deciding that an ADEA plaintiff who invokes\nthe second path to judicial review by filing an EEO complaint must then exhaust his\nadministrative remedies, USDA has failed to meet its burden of proving that Plaintiff has not\ndone so—as explained in the next section.\n4\n  Although Morgan pertained to the deadline for filing a Title VII claim against a private\nemployer, rather than to the separate administrative deadlines applicable to claims alleged\nagainst the federal government as employer, see 536 U.S. at 104–105, courts have applied\nMorgan in the latter context as well. See, e.g., Nurriddin v. Goldin, 382 F. Supp. 2d 79, 92\n(D.D.C. 2005), aff’d sub nom. Nurriddin v. Griffin, 222 F. App’x 5 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (per\ncuriam); Velikonja v. Mueller, 315 F. Supp. 2d 66, 74 n.3 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d in part, rev’d in\npart sub nom. Velikonja v. Gonzales, 466 F.3d 122 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (per curiam); Bowie v.\nAshcroft, 283 F. Supp. 2d 25, 34 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n                                                 13\n\fseveral of the alleged discriminatory acts are time-barred because they occurred more than 45\n\ndays before February 6, 2009, see id. at 6–7. Although USDA may be able to support this\n\ndefense on a more complete record, its argument fails at this preliminary stage for two reasons.\n\n       First, because the complaint itself does not contain the dates on which the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory acts occurred, USDA attempts to glean the relevant dates from the various\n\nattachments to Plaintiff’s complaint and the EEO complaint attached to USDA’s motion. It\n\nwould be premature, however, to dismiss the complaint on non-exhaustion grounds based solely\n\non USDA’s (or the Court’s) cobbling together of the apparent timing of the relevant events from\n\nthese incomplete documents. In Bowden v. United States, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal\n\nof a complaint on non-exhaustion grounds because “the pleadings and undisputed documents in\n\nthe record” established that the plaintiff had failed to notify his federal employer within 30 days\n\nof learning that it had breached a Title VII settlement agreement, and the plaintiff conceded that\n\nhe did not write to the federal agency until a year after he learned of the matter. 106 F.3d at 437.\n\nHere, in contrast, the record is less clear about when the alleged discriminatory acts occurred,\n\nand, more importantly, for how long they continued. USDA, for example, suggests that Plaintiff\n\nwaited from October 2007 until February 2009 to initiate EEO counseling with respect to her\n\nclaim that she was denied proper training and was unfairly harassed for failing timely to process\n\nfiles that another employee had also failed timely to process. Dkt. 12-1 at 6. USDA also notes\n\nthat Plaintiff “raised the lack of training” in August 2008 and complained in September 2008 that\n\nit was “unfair” to require her to submit her questions in writing—both many months prior to the\n\ncounseling she sought in February 2009. Id. at 7. None of this, however, addresses the questions\n\nwhether the allegedly discriminatory conduct was part of a continuing violation, and, if so, for\n\nhow long it continued.\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f       Second, Plaintiff’s statement in her EEO complaint that she consulted an EEO counselor\n\non February 6, 2009, does not conclusively establish that that was the only or the earliest date on\n\nwhich she did so. Absent clear support for USDA’s contention that February 6, 2009, was\n\nPlaintiff’s first consultation with an EEO counselor, the Court cannot conclude that USDA has\n\nmet its burden of proving non-exhaustion in the face of an incomplete administrative record at\n\nthe motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, while USDA relies on a statement in one document noting\n\nthat Plaintiff sought counseling on February 6, 2009, it ignores another document that suggests\n\nthat February 6, 2009 was not Plaintiff’s first contact with an EEO official. That document, a\n\nMarch 10, 2010 letter by Plaintiff’s personal representative to the head of the USDA\n\nEmployment Complaints Division, states that “several months prior” to meeting with an EEO\n\n“Counselor and later . . . filing her complaint on February 10, 2009, [Plaintiff] had at least two\n\nseparate one-on-one conversations with Ms. Myrna P. Young, Assistant Director of Alternative\n\nDispute Resolution, at USDA-APHIS” in Riverdale. Dkt. 1 at 41. 5 In Steele v. Schafer, the D.C.\n\nCircuit reversed a grant of summary judgment on non-exhaustion grounds because, while the\n\ncomplaint stated a date on which the plaintiff met with an EEO counselor, it did “not say that this\n\nwas the only period in which she contacted a counselor, and . . . other documents in the record\n\ncreate a ‘discrepancy’ regarding the first contact date.” 535 F.3d 689, 693 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The\n\nsame conclusion holds here as well.\n\n       USDA also argues that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her “claims of unlawful employment\n\nconduct that allegedly occurred in June 2009” because she “failed to initiate any EEO\n\ncounseling” relating to that post-February 2009 conduct. Dkt. 12-1 at 7–8. It is far from clear,\n\n\n\n\n5\n A subsequent letter by Plaintiff’s personal representative to the Office of Adjudication refers to\nMyrna Young as the “EEO Director.” Id. at 44.\n                                                 15\n\fhowever, that the complaint alleges claims based on post-February 2009 conduct. Moreover, to\n\nthe extent that it alleges that the pre-February 2009 conduct continued after February 2009, there\n\nis no reason that USDA’s alleged failure to redress any allegedly ongoing discriminatory conduct\n\nshould insulate that conduct from review. And, as discussed further below, the Court concludes\n\nthat the complaint does not adequately allege a claim with respect to the one discrete allegation\n\nof discrimination that apparently occurred after February 2009—the search of Plaintiff’s\n\nemployment records to determine her retirement date. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 9).\n\n       Finally, USDA contends that Plaintiff has conceded the exhaustion issue because her\n\nopposition to its motion to dismiss does not address Defendant’s arguments. See Dkt. 15 at 2–3.\n\nPlaintiff’s brief is not by any means a model of clarity, and it largely recounts the allegations in\n\nher March 10, 2009 and May 1, 2009 EEO Complaints. Pro se pleadings, however, must “be\n\nliberally construed,” Fed. Exp. Corp., 552 U.S. at 402, and Plaintiff’s brief does allude to two\n\npotentially responsive arguments: that (1) she experienced “recurring harassment and ridiculing\n\nthat continued from 2007 to 2009”; and that (2) she “met with her supervisors and then with\n\n[Civil Rights Enforcement and Compliance] office personnel who all should have been logically\n\nconnected with the EEO program,” although the timing of these meetings is far from clear. Dkt.\n\n14 at 15. If Plaintiff were responding to a motion for summary judgment that was supported by\n\nevidence and a statement of undisputed material facts, her response might not suffice. Cf.\n\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986) (the party opposing\n\nsummary judgment “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to\n\nthe material facts”); Latson, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 386–87. Here, however, the question is not\n\nwhether Plaintiff has come forward with evidence to rebut a prima facie showing that the\n\nmaterial facts are not in dispute. Rather, the question is merely whether she has conceded non-\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fexhaustion at the pleading stage, and the Court concludes that she has not. Although short on\n\ndetail, Plaintiff has responded, and her arguments are facially plausible. 6\n\nB. Adequacy of Plaintiff’s Allegations\n\n        Next, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted because (1) Counts I and II do not allege an adverse employment action as required for a\n\ndisparate treatment claim; (2) Count III does not include allegations that are sufficiently severe\n\nor pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment; (3) Count III is also deficient because\n\nTitle VII preempts her claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; and (4) Counts IV and V pertain to the\n\nagency’s processing of her administrative complaint, which is not independently actionable.\n\n        In considering USDA’s motion to dismiss, the Court is guided by the overarching rule\n\nthat a complaint must “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds\n\nupon which it rests.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ A claim has facial\n\n\n\n6\n  A number of judges in this jurisdiction have held that the EEO counseling requirement may be\nsatisfied by raising one’s claims with supervisors or management. See Bergbauer v. Mabus, 810\nF. Supp. 2d 251, 259 (D.D.C. 2011) (“[T]he purpose served by EEO contact is also served where\na complainant brings such acts to the attention of a supervisor.”); Lloyd v. Chao, 240 F. Supp. 2d\n1, 4 (D.D.C. 2002) (holding that plaintiff “satisfied the purpose underlying the EEO counseling\nrequirement” by notifying supervisors of harassment and hostile work environment claims\nbecause “an employee’s contact with management officials is tantamount to initiating contact\nwith an EEO counselor”). But see Carter v. Greenspan, 304 F. Supp. 2d 13, 23–24 & n.10\n(D.D.C. 2004) (holding that plaintiff’s pursuit of “an internal dispute resolution procedure with\nhis supervisors and a human resources representative cannot replace the required initial contact\nwith an EEO counselor within 45 days”). Similarly, the D.C. Circuit has noted that the EEOC\n“has consistently held that a complainant satisfies the criterion of EEO counselor contact by\ncontacting an agency official logically connected with the EEO process, even if that official is\nnot an EEO counselor, and by exhibiting an intent to begin the EEO process.” Miller v.\nHersman, 594 F.3d 8, 11 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (quoting Osuagwu v. Peake, No. 0120081307,\n2008 WL 2264405, at *1 (E.E.O.C. May 20, 2008)).\n\n                                                  17\n\fplausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678\n\n(quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556, 570) (internal citation omitted). The Court need not accept\n\nas true any legal conclusions that are disguised as factual allegations, or inferences unsupported\n\nby facts in the complaint, see Trudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006), but will give\n\nthe plaintiff “the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged,” see Am.\n\nNat’l Ins. Co. v. FDIC, 642 F.3d 1137, 1139 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Although Defendant construes the complaint as alleging discrete counts of disparate\n\ntreatment (Counts I and II) and hostile work environment (Count III), Dkt. 12-1 at 8, 10, 15 &\n\nn.6, the Court declines to construe Plaintiff’s pro se complaint in this neatly divided manner.\n\nCount III, for example, includes some allegations that sound in harassment/hostile work\n\nenvironment, see Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 11), but others that sound in disparate treatment, id. at 4\n\n(Compl. ¶ 13). “Although absence of segregation in the complaint doubtless complicates the\n\ncourt’s task, the complication can presumably be cured by insistence on suitably targeted\n\nbriefing, and is not an independent ground for” treating the allegations as raising only discrete\n\nclaims. Baird v. Gotbaum, 662 F.3d 1246, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2011). See also Kelly v. LaHood,\n\n840 F. Supp. 2d 293, 304 (D.D.C. 2012) (“A complaint need not necessarily use the words\n\n‘hostile work environment’ in order to make out a hostile-work-environment claim. Indeed,\n\n‘discrimination’ or ‘retaliation’ can ‘in principle include[] a hostile work environment theory.’”\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting Steele, 535 F.3d at 694). What is important is that the\n\n“‘complaint and the evidence of the plaintiff . . . be sufficient to put defendants on notice of any\n\ntheory of recovery upon which the plaintiff is relying.’” Id. (quoting Overby v. Nat’l Ass’n of\n\nLetter Carriers, 595 F.3d 1290, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 2010)). The Court accordingly organizes its\n\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fanalysis of whether Plaintiff has failed to state a claim around the relevant theories of relief.\n\nBecause the substantive requirements for Title VII and ADEA discrimination and retaliation\n\nclaims are the same in relevant respects (other than the protected group covered), the Court treats\n\nthe two causes of action together in the remainder of this opinion. See Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d\n\n446, 456 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1999), abrogated on other grounds by Steele, 535 F.3d 696.\n\n       1. Disparate Treatment Claims\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of disparate treatment under Title VII and the ADEA,\n\nPlaintiff must show that “(1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse\n\nemployment action; and (3) she was treated differently from similarly-situated employees\n\noutside the protected class.” Maramark v. Spellings, No. 01-2206, 2006 WL 276979, at *14\n\n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2006) aff’d, No. 06-5099, 2007 WL 2935411 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 20, 2007). USDA\n\nconcedes for purposes of the instant motion that Plaintiff meets the first and third elements. Dkt.\n\n12-1 at 9. It contends, however, that Plaintiff’s disparate treatment claims must be dismissed for\n\nfailure to state a claim because she “has not alleged that she suffered an adverse [employment]\n\naction.” Id. at 8. The Court agrees.\n\n       An adverse employment action is a “diminution in pay or benefits” or “some other\n\nmaterially adverse consequences affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of her employment\n\nor her future employment opportunities such that a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that\n\nthe plaintiff has suffered objectively tangible harm.” Brody, 199 F.3d at 457. Thus, while\n\n“hiring, firing, failing to promote, [and] reassignment with significantly different responsibilities\n\ncategorically are adverse employment actions,” Douglas v. Donovan, 559 F.3d 549, 556 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2009) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted), “[p]urely subjective\n\ninjuries, such as dissatisfaction with a reassignment . . . or public humiliation or loss or\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\freputation, . . . are not adverse actions,” Forkkio v. Powell, 306 F.3d 1127, 1130 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2002). The question is not whether an employer has taken an action that makes “an employee\n\nunhappy,” Russell v. Principi, 257 F.3d 815, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001), but whether the action\n\nresulted in a “significant” and “objectively tangible” harm, Douglas, 559 F.3d at 552 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       Plaintiff’s first claim of discriminatory treatment alleges that USDA maintained “illegal\n\ndouble standards” when it ignored complaints about Caucasian employees and “provided them\n\nmultiple career opportunities to redeem themselves” while subjecting Plaintiff to a “‘no\n\ntolerance’ [requirement] . . . that she compl[y] with office and agency policies.” Dkt. 1 at 2\n\n(Compl. ¶ 7). This allegation fails to state a claim because it does not “give the defendant fair\n\nnotice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\nMost significantly, Plaintiff does not allege that she herself sought and was denied career\n\nopportunities that were provided to others; she alleges only that other employees received\n\n“multiple career opportunities” notwithstanding unspecified complaints about them. Dkt. 1 at 2\n\n(Compl. ¶ 7). Plaintiff’s allegation that USDA “provided multiple favorable career\n\nopportunities” to a Caucasian employee “when she complained” but “harassed” Plaintiff when\n\nshe “expressed any workplace concerns” fails for the same reasons. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 9). 7\n\nEven if more factual support for these allegations might be gleaned from the documents\n\nappended to the complaint, the Court is unable to identify any allegation that Plaintiff was denied\n\nany specific “career opportunity” because of her race, sex, or age.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  This allegation also fails to state a claim if construed as a retaliation claim. Plaintiff does not\nprovide more than a conclusory statement that she “expressed . . . workplace concerns,” Dkt. 1 at\n3 (Compl. ¶ 9), which is insufficient to state a plausible claim that “she engaged in a statutorily\nprotected activity,” Brody, 199 F.3d at 452.\n                                                 20\n\f        To the extent that Plaintiff merely points to the criticism that she allegedly faced due to\n\nher failure to “comply with office and agency policies” and due to the unspecified complaints\n\nthat she made, that type of intangible injury is insufficient to satisfy the adverse employment\n\naction requirement for a disparate treatment claim. See Broderick v. Donaldson, 437 F.3d 1226,\n\n1234 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding that a “disciplinary memo . . . does not qualify as an adverse\n\naction” if it does “not affect . . . grade, salary, duties, or responsibilities”); Weng v. Solis, 960 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 239, 247–48 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that neither a “Warning Memorandum” nor a\n\n“Letter of Reprimand” constituted adverse employment actions in the absence of effect on\n\n“grade, salary, benefits” or other “terms, conditions, or privileges of . . . employment or future\n\nemployment opportunities”). “‘[A] bruised ego’ will not suffice to make an employment action\n\nadverse.” Stewart v. Ashcroft, 352 F.3d 422, 426 (D.C. Cir. 2003). As a result, a “‘poor\n\nperformance evaluation[]” does not rise to the level of an “adverse action[],” absent an “‘affect[ ]\n\n[on] the [employee’s] grade or salary’” or other terms or conditions of employment. Taylor v.\n\nSmall, 350 F.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (second, third, and fourth alterations in original)\n\n(quoting Brody, 199 F.3d at 457–58). Here, Plaintiff has not alleged any such consequence.\n\n        Plaintiff’s allegation that she was not provided with training or guidance also fails to state\n\na claim. Although “a denial of training may rise to the level of an adverse employment action,”\n\nFreedman v. MCI Telecomms. Corp., 255 F. 3d 840, 845 (D.C. Cir. 2001), Plaintiff has not\n\nalleged that she was denied training opportunities that were provided to her peers. Plaintiff does\n\nallege that other employees were allowed to ask questions freely and to exchange emails seeking\n\ninformal guidance, while she was required to submit her questions in writing to her supervisor,\n\nbut she does not allege that this differential treatment materially affected “the terms, conditions,\n\nor privileges of . . . employment or . . . future employment,” Brody, 199 F.3d at 457, or that she\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\fwas even indirectly deprived of any employment benefit or opportunity as a result of this more\n\ncumbersome process for asking questions. Even if the process imposed on Plaintiff for posing\n\nquestions was both unfair and embarrassing, more is needed to state a claim under Title VII or\n\nthe ADEA. See Forkkio, 306 F.3d at 1130.\n\n       Plaintiff’s allegation that she was given a larger workload than a younger, Caucasian\n\ncolleague comes closer to stating a claim but also fails. The “[c]ourts have consistently held that\n\n. . . increased workload,” standing alone, does not rise to the level of “adverse employment\n\naction.” Saba v. U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, 26 F. Supp. 3d 16, 25 (D.D.C. 2014); see also Lester\n\nv. Natsios, 290 F. Supp. 2d 11, 29–30 (D.D.C. 2003) (collecting cases); Mungin v. Katten\n\nMuchin & Zavis, 116 F.3d 1549, 1557 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (“[C]hanges in assignments or work-\n\nrelated duties do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions if unaccompanied by a\n\ndecrease in salary or work hour changes.”). Rather, to “constitute an actionable injury,” an\n\nalleged disparate workload must be “accompanied by some other” allegation of an “adverse\n\nchange in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.” Mack v. Straus, 134 F. Supp. 2d\n\n103, 113 (D.D.C. 2001), aff’d, No. 01-5122, 2001 WL 1286263 (D.C. Cir. Sept. 28, 2001). A\n\nplaintiff might allege, for example, that an increase in workload resulted in a “material decrease\n\nin her [hourly or effective] salary,” or changed “her working conditions.” Lester, 290 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 29. Here, however, Plaintiff merely alleges that she was given a larger workload. She does\n\nnot allege that she, as a result, was required to work longer hours, that she was denied a bonus or\n\npromotion based on her failure to complete her assignments, or that she suffered any other\n\nconcomitant “adverse change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of [her] employment.”\n\nMack, 134 F. Supp. 2d at 113. Accordingly, at least as currently pled, this claim also fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f        In her brief in opposition to USDA’s motion to dismiss, Plaintiff suggests that “recurring\n\nhostility . . . and other incidents . . . pressured” her to retire early. Dkt. 14 at 20–21. To the\n\nextent that she now argues that she was constructively discharged, that claim is not included in\n\nthe complaint. See Lempert v. Rice, 956 F. Supp. 2d 17, 30 (D.D.C. 2013) (“[I]t is axiomatic that\n\na complaint may not be amended by the briefs in opposition to a motion to dismiss.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Rather, the only non-conclusory allegation in the complaint that\n\nmight support such a claim is the allegation that the agency searched Plaintiff’s personnel\n\nrecords to obtain the date that she would be eligible to retire and “used that date as part of its\n\nresolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire years prior to her anticipate[d] date.” Dkt. 1 at 3\n\n(Compl. ¶ 9). From the cross-referenced material, it appears that Plaintiff is referring to the\n\nagency’s efforts to settle the dispute as part of the EEO process. See e.g., Dkt. 1 at 11. In\n\nresponse, USDA argues that this communication is protected under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n408 as an offer of compromise. Dkt. 12-1 at 8 n.2. The Court, however, need not reach that\n\nissue, because the allegation in the complaint is too vague to state a claim for constructive\n\ndischarge, even in light of the liberal pleading rules applicable to pro se litigants. See Fed. Exp.\n\nCorp., 552 U.S. at 402. Indeed, the complaint never even alleges that Plaintiff actually left\n\nUSDA. That fact can only be inferred from the attachments to the complaint, which suggest that\n\nPlaintiff did not retire until late 2010, long after she filed her February, March, and May 2009\n\nEEO complaints. Dkt. 1 at 17, 51. Absent specific factual allegations contained in the complaint\n\nabout whether, when, and why Plaintiff retired, the complaint cannot reasonably be construed to\n\nstate a claim for constructive discharge. Cf. Pa. State Police v. Suders, 542 U.S. 129, 141 (2004)\n\n(discussing elements of constructive discharge claim).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  23\n\f        2. Hostile Work Environment Claim\n\n        USDA also argues that Plaintiff’s allegations fail to state a hostile work environment\n\nclaim because they “do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness” required for such a\n\nclaim. Dkt. 12-1 at 11. To state a hostile work environment claim, the Plaintiff need not allege a\n\n“tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.”\n\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775, 807–08 (1998). Rather, a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim requires a showing of harassment that, “to be actionable, . . . must be\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and [to]\n\ncreate an abusive working environment.” Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67\n\n(1986) (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original). To meet this test, an\n\n“objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a\n\nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be\n\nso.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787. Courts, accordingly, “look[] to the totality of the circumstances,\n\nincluding the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether\n\nit interferes with an employee’s work performance.” Baloch v. Kempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191,\n\n1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n        A number of Plaintiff’s allegations could potentially fall under the hostile work\n\nenvironment rubric. Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) did not provide her “training or proper\n\nguidance,” Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8); (2) “harassed and criticized” her for not processing cases\n\nwithin guidelines, id.; (3) “harassed” her when she “expressed any workplace concerns,”\n\nincluding “taking the liberty to search for personal data about plaintiff’s eligible date to retire”\n\nand using it “as part of its resolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire,” id. (Compl. ¶ 9); (4)\n\n“failed to timely resolve the recurring complaints of inappropriate behavior and sexual\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fharassment charges about the one GS-13 Caucasian male that created unsuitable work\n\nconditions,” id. (Compl. ¶ 11); (5) “failed to use its own policies to execute . . . remedial action\n\nto secure plaintiff’s rights . . . to work in a healthy harassment-free environment,” id. at 3–4\n\n(Compl. ¶ 12); and (6) “harras[ed] [Plaintiff] not to ask work-related questions,” id. at 4 (Compl.\n\n¶ 13). The Court concludes, however, that these allegations fail to state a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim with sufficient factual specificity.\n\n       Unspecified claims of “harassment,” “inappropriate behavior,” and “unsuitable”\n\nconditions are the sort of “mere conclusory statements” that the court need not accept as true\n\nwhen weighing the plausibility of the plaintiff’s complaint. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Although a\n\nplaintiff need not at this stage provide an exhaustive account of the offensive conduct to which\n\nshe was allegedly subjected, a complaint—even a pro se one—must contain “sufficient factual\n\nmatter” for the Court to conclude that relief is plausible and to put the Defendant on notice of the\n\nclaim. Id. To the extent that the forgoing allegations include any factual detail, those facts do\n\nnot establish the type of severe or pervasive harassment necessary to state a claim for hostile\n\nwork environment. Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787–78. “Title VII is not a general civility code for\n\nthe American workplace, nor does it serve as a remedy for all instances of verbal or physical\n\nharassment for it does not ‘purge the workplace of vulgarity.’” Stewart v. Evans, 275 F.3d 1126,\n\n1133 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Burlington N. & Santa Fe R.R. Co. v. White, 548 U.S. 53 (2006). Rather, “conduct\n\nmust be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment,” Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 788, and “a few isolated incidents of offensive conduct do not amount to actionable\n\nharassment,” Stewart, 275 F.3d at 1134.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Here, many of Plaintiff’s allegations constitute either “legal conclusions” or “conclusory\n\nstatements,” which will not suffice to state a claim. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. And, where Plaintiff\n\ndoes provide more detail, those allegations do not rise to the “extreme” level required to alter\n\n“the terms and conditions of employment.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788. Most notably, the\n\ncomplaint alleges that “[t]he entire staff of supervisors and subordinates of all . . . ethnic groups\n\n. . . communicated with each other . . . via e-mail and [by] asking work-related questions,” while\n\nPlaintiff was required to pose only handwritten questions to her supervisor. Dkt. 1 at 4 (Compl.\n\n¶ 13). Even putting aside the problem that this allegation asserts that employees “of all ethnic\n\ngroups” were treated alike and that it was simply Plaintiff who was singled out, id., it fails to\n\nmeet the “demanding standard” for alleging a hostile work environment claim, Smith v. De Novo\n\nLegal, LLC, 905 F. Supp. 2d 99, 102 (D.D.C. 2012). Although cumbersome and potentially\n\nembarrassing, the requirement that Plaintiff submit handwritten questions was not so extreme\n\nthat it, in effect, altered the terms or conditions of Plaintiff’s employment. She does not allege\n\nthat the requirement “unreasonably interfere[d] with [her] work performance,” Stewart, 275 F.3d\n\nat 1133–34, or that it created an objectively caustic or offensive environment, cf. Burkes v.\n\nHolder, 953 F. Supp. 2d 167, 176–77 (D.D.C. 2013) (holding that allegations of repeated\n\nexposure “to racist and offensive symbols over a period of time” were sufficient to state a claim).\n\n       Without more, Plaintiff’s allegations fall short of the type of “discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of\n\nthe victim’s employment and create an abusive working environment.” Harris v. Forklift Sys.\n\nInc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Plaintiff’s non-\n\nconclusory factual allegations thus fail to “nudge . . . across the line from conceivable to\n\nplausible,” Teliska v. Napolitano, 826 F. Supp. 2d 94, 99 (D.D.C. 2011), her claim that she was\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\fsubjected to “an objectively hostile or abusive work environment” based on race, sex, or age,\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 21. See also Jones v. Horne, 634 F.3d 588, 596 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[E]ven [a\n\npro se complaint] must plead factual matter that permits the court to infer more than the mere\n\npossibility of misconduct.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Finally, although\n\nsome of the exhibits in this case allude to what may indeed be troubling work conditions, it is not\n\nthe Court’s role to determine which statements contained in the attachments might supplement\n\nPlaintiff’s conclusory allegations. Cf. Little v. Cox’s Supermarkets, 71 F.3d 637, 641 (7th Cir.\n\n1995) (“[J]ust as a district court is not required to scour the record looking for factual disputes, it\n\nis not required to scour the party’s various submissions to piece together appropriate\n\narguments.”). Accordingly, Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim cannot stand as currently\n\npled.\n\n        3. Administrative Process Claims\n\n        Plaintiff makes several allegations relating to the administrative processing of her\n\ndiscrimination complaint in Count V under the heading “Retaliation Claims.” See Dkt. 1 at 4. In\n\nthat count, Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) “violated [her] due process rights by failing to process\n\nher grievance in accordance with the Commission’s regulations, rules, and procedures . . . under\n\n29 C.F.R. 1614,” id. (Compl. ¶ 15); (2) “failed to cure the discrepancies, errors, and record issues\n\nprior to forwarding [her] grievance . . . to EEOC[] for action,” id. (Compl. ¶ 17); and (3) “failed\n\nto investigate [her] claims filed against them within the 180-day requirement,” id. (Compl. ¶ 18).\n\nIn Counts III and IV, Plaintiff also alleges that “the claims USDA identified for investigation\n\nexcluded [Plaintiff’s]” harassment and hostile work environment claims “for which she was\n\ncounseled.” Id. at 3–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 14) (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       These allegations fail to state a claim. First, USDA’s alleged failure to follow the EEOC\n\nregulations regarding the administrative processing of her claim is not actionable. As the D.C.\n\nCircuit has explained, there is “no cause of action . . . for challenges to [administrative]\n\nprocessing of [an employment discrimination] claim.” Smith v. Casellas, 119 F.3d 33, 34 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). Rather, a plaintiff’s ability to “bring a Title VII action directly against\n\nhis or her employer [is] . . . the remedy for any improper [administrative] handling of a\n\ndiscrimination charge.” Id. Should the agency fail to take timely action on a Title VII\n\ncomplaint, the remedy available to the plaintiff is to file suit against her employer in federal\n\ncourt after seeking to exhaust remedies and waiting the required period of time. 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.407(b).\n\n       Second, Plaintiff’s claims fare no better when framed as a Due Process challenge, since\n\nany procedural flaws in the administrative process did not deprive her of a property or liberty\n\ninterest protected by the Constitution. See, e.g., Council of the Blind of Del. Cty. Valley v.\n\nRegan, 709 F.2d 1521, 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“The agency’s failure to follow the applicable\n\nrules is relevant to a due process claim only if the agency’s action deprives the plaintiff of life,\n\nliberty, or property. In the present case it does not.” (emphasis in original)). As noted above,\n\nthe employee’s judicial remedies remain available, regardless of whether the agency or EEOC\n\nhas properly addressed the administrative complaint. And to the extent that Plaintiff is alleging\n\nthat the agency retaliated against her by improperly processing her administrative charge, she\n\nalso fails to state a claim because improper administrative processing “has no discernable\n\nnegative consequences for plaintiff’s employment.” Stewart, 275 F.3d at 1136.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f       4. Section 1981 Claim\n\n       Finally, although it is unclear whether Plaintiff even sought to raise a claim under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981, USDA argues that Plaintiff has failed to state such a claim. The complaint makes\n\na passing reference to “plaintiff’s rights governed under Title 42 U.S.C.A. 1981 to work in a\n\nhealthy harassment-free environment,” Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 12), but expressly identifies her\n\nclaims as arising under Title VII and ADEA, id. at 1–2 (Compl. ¶¶ 3–4). In any event, Plaintiff\n\ncannot bring a claim that her federal government employer engaged in race-based discrimination\n\nunder § 1981. “[Section] 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as added by § 11 of the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), [is] the\n\nexclusive individual remedy available to a federal employee complaining of job-related racial\n\ndiscrimination.” Brown, 425 U.S. at 824–25.\n\n                                     III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The Court concludes that, although USDA has failed to meet its burden of proving non-\n\nexhaustion, Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. This dismissal is\n\nwithout prejudice. If Plaintiff is able to modify her complaint in a manner that addresses the\n\ndeficiencies discussed above, she may file an amended complaint on or before February 1, 2016.\n\nAn accompanying order is filed concurrently with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                     /s/ Randolph D.

See Dkt. 1 at 1 (Compl. ¶ 2). At the time\n\nshe began work at APHIS, Plaintiff was approximately 53 years old. See id. She alleges that, in\n\nthe course of her employment, the USDA discriminated against her on the basis of her race, sex,\n\nand age. Id. at 2 (Compl. ¶ 4). Her complaint includes claims of disparate treatment, a hostile\n\nwork environment, and retaliation. Id. at 2–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 7–18).\n\n       The USDA has moved to dismiss on multiple grounds. See Dkt. 12. It contends that\n\nseveral of Plaintiff’s claims should be dismissed on the basis of her failure timely to exhaust her\n\nadministrative remedies; that Plaintiff did not suffer any “adverse personnel action” within the\n\nmeaning of the antidiscrimination laws; that Plaintiff has failed to alleged facts that, even if taken\n\nas true, would rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness required to establish the existence of a\n\nhostile work environment; that Plaintiff’s challenges to the manner in which USDA processed\n\fher administrative complaint do not state a claim; and that 42 U.S.C. § 1981 does not provide a\n\ncause of action for claims against federal agencies for employment discrimination.\n\n       For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that USDA has not carried its\n\nburden of demonstrating that Plaintiff failed timely to exhaust her claims. The Court further\n\nconcludes, however, that the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to establish that Plaintiff\n\nsuffered a cognizable adverse employment action or that she was subjected to a hostile work\n\nenvironment. Finally, the Court concludes that the alleged deficiencies in the administrative\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity process are not actionable and that Section 1981 does not apply\n\nto claims of employment discrimination in the federal workforce.\n\n       The Court, accordingly, GRANTS USDA’s motion (Dkt. 12) and dismisses the\n\ncomplaint without prejudice.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n       As an initial matter, the Court must decide which factual allegations are properly before\n\nthe Court. Plaintiff’s five-count complaint is a mere six pages long, and it contains few non-\n\nconclusory factual allegations. Dkt. 1 at 1–6. It is accompanied, however, by over 40 pages of\n\nexhibits, including email and other correspondence, a newspaper article, and, more helpfully,\n\nPlaintiff’s May 1, 2009 administrative complaint and the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission’s (“EEOC”) final decision regarding that complaint. Id. at 8–55.\n\n       In adjudicating a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, a court may consider,\n\nalong with the facts alleged in the complaint, “any documents either attached to or incorporated\n\nin the complaint and matters” subject to “judicial notice.” EEOC v.

Importantly, USDA has identified these same factual allegations in its motion to\n\ndismiss, see Dkt. 12-1 at 1–2, and does not dispute that these allegations should be taken as true\n\nfor purposes of the pending motion, Ashcroft v.

See Laughlin v. Holder,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209 (D.D.C. 2013); see also St. Francis Xavier Parochial Sch., 117 F.3d at\n624 (court may consider “matters of which [it] may take judicial notice” on a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion without converting the motion to a Rule 56 motion).\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f        Plaintiff began employment at APHIS in October 2007, where she worked as an\n\ninvestigator for the Investigative and Enforcement Services (“IES”) division. Dkt. 12-2 at 1.\n\nShe is an African-American female who was approximately 53 years old when she started work\n\nat APHIS. Dkt. 1 at 1 (Compl. ¶ 2). Problems began almost immediately upon her arrival. At\n\nthat time, she was given a large caseload, including the “backlog of more than 100\n\ndelinquent/neglected cases” that previously had been assigned to a younger, Caucasian\n\nemployee. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8); Dkt. 12-2 at 3, 8. To make matters worse, according to\n\nPlaintiff, she was not provided any training or guidance regarding how to process the cases. Dkt.\n\n1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8). When she sought guidance, Plaintiff—unlike other employees—was told\n\n“not to ask work-related questions” of other employees and “not to send e-mail messages” with\n\nquestions. Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶ 13). Instead, she was relegated to posing her questions by writing\n\nthem on pieces of paper and bringing them to her supervisor’s “desk for responses.” Id.\n\n        Plaintiff further alleges that USDA adopted a “no tolerance” policy with respect to her\n\nwork and her ability to process her caseload within “stringent guidelines.” Id. at 2–3 (Compl.\n\n¶¶ 7–8). Others, including the younger, Caucasian employee from whom Plaintiff inherited the\n\nlarge backlog of unprocessed cases, were not held to this stringent standard. Id. at 3 (Compl.\n\n¶ 8). Indeed, that employee received “multiple, favorable career opportunities,” despite the fact\n\nthat she “complained and failed to process her . . . workload in compliance with office policies.”\n\nId. (Compl. ¶ 9). When Plaintiff “expressed any workplace concerns, USDA harassed” her,\n\nincluding by “taking the liberty to search for personal data about [P]laintiff’s eligible date to\n\nretire” and using “that date as part of its resolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire” before “her\n\nanticipate[d] date.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\f       More generally, the complaint alleges that USDA applied a “double standard[]” to\n\nPlaintiff relative to “two . . . Caucasian female[]” employees and a “Caucasian male” employee.\n\nId at 2 (Compl. ¶ 7). USDA, for example, “failed to timely resolve recurring complaints of\n\ninappropriate behavior and sexual harassment” involving the Caucasian male employee, while\n\n“quickly redressing any issue” regarding Plaintiff. Id. at 3 (Compl. ¶ 11). According to Plaintiff,\n\nthis differential treatment, including the requirement that she meet productivity standards that\n\nwere not applied to others, USDA’s failure to provide training, and the special rules that applied\n\nto her alone for asking questions were motivated by her race, sex, and age. Id. at 2 (Compl. ¶ 4).\n\nB. Administrative Proceedings\n\n       On March 10, 2009, Plaintiff faxed an Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”)\n\ncomplaint detailing her claims of workplace discrimination to a USDA EEO counselor. Dkt. 1 at\n\n13; Dkt. 12-2. In that document, Plaintiff states that she “consulted with the USDA-EEO\n\nCounselor” on February 6, 2009, and that she subsequently filed an EEO complaint on February\n\n10, 2009. Dkt 12-2 at 1. The February 10 EEO complaint does not appear in the record. On\n\nMay 1, 2009, Plaintiff lodged another EEO complaint with USDA, which does appear in the\n\nrecord. See Dkt. 1 at 13–14.\n\n       On June 30, 2009, Lauren Hill, an Employment Complaints Manager in the Civil Rights\n\nEnforcement and Compliance Office of APHIS, sent Plaintiff a proposal for resolution of her\n\nEEO complaint, offering that the Plaintiff take her annual leave, paid in advance, until she\n\nbecame eligible for retirement on August 15, 2009. Id. at 11. Hill also apparently\n\ncommunicated with Plaintiff’s “personal representative” in March and April 2010 regarding a\n\nproposed resolution. Id. at 24.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f       From March 2010 to August 2013, Plaintiff and her personal representative transmitted\n\nletters and emails to various USDA officials describing her dissatisfaction with the\n\nadministrative process. See Dkt. 1 at 16, 23, 35, 39, 41, 43, 55. In the letters, Plaintiff asserted\n\nthat there were multiple players in the process whose roles she did not understand, id. at 16; that\n\nthe EEO adjudicators had identified and pursued claims that did not relate to her complaints and\n\nhad excluded other allegations for which she had obtained counseling, id. at 16, 25, 36; that she\n\nfelt bullied by an investigator, id. at 16; that the investigators did not speak with or obtain\n\naffidavits or declarations from any of her witnesses, id. at 17, 24–25, 43, 55; and that she was not\n\noffered Alternative Dispute Resolution, id. at 35. On May 20, 2010, Plaintiff’s personal\n\nrepresentative received the agency’s Report of Investigation, id. at 24, although that report does\n\nnot appear in the record. In an email to a USDA official dated November 4, 2010, Plaintiff\n\nexplained that she had decided to retire from USDA because of “unresolved issues” regarding\n\n“the hostile work conditions and harassment” and the EEO administrative process. Id. at 17.\n\n       USDA issued a Final Agency Decision with “no finding of discrimination” on February\n\n7, 2011. Id. at 37. On appeal, the EEOC ruled in favor of USDA on December 27, 2012. Id.\n\nNeither of these decisions appear in the record. At least twice in 2012, and possibly as many as\n\nfive times, Plaintiff petitioned the EEOC to remand her case back to USDA, alleging that the\n\nagency had failed properly to process her administrative complaints. Id. at 27, 32. The EEOC\n\ndenied a request for reconsideration on July 16, 2013. Id. at 53. Finally, on September 16, 2013,\n\nthe Director of USDA’s Office of Adjudication responded to a letter from Plaintiff’s personal\n\nrepresentative about Plaintiff’s concerns regarding the administrative process, stating that “[a]s\n\nall administrative appeals have been exhausted in [Plaintiff’s] complaint, we can offer no further\n\nremedy.” Id. at 37.\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fC. The Present Lawsuit\n\n       Plaintiff filed this case on September 30, 2013, Dkt. 1, within the 90-day period\n\nauthorized following the EEOC’s final decision denying reconsideration, id. at 52–54. The\n\ncomplaint contains five counts:\n\n       Counts I, II, and III are based on the allegations outlined above about differential\n\ntreatment, including the requirement that Plaintiff meet productivity standards that were not\n\napplied to others, USDA’s failure to provide training, and the special rules that applied to her\n\nalone for posing questions. Id. at 2–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 7–13).\n\n       In Count III, the Plaintiff also alleges that USDA identified claims for investigation that\n\n“excluded [Plaintiff’s] alleged harassment claims for which [P]laintiff was counseled” and\n\n“failed to use its own policies to execute imminent remedial action to secure plaintiff’s rights . . .\n\nto work in a healthy harassment-free environment.” Id. at 3–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 12).\n\n       In Count IV, Plaintiff repeats the allegation that USDA failed to investigate certain\n\nclaims for which she was counseled, describing the excluded claims only as “hostile work\n\nconditions claims.” Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶ 14).\n\n       In Count V, labeled “retaliation claims,” Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) violated\n\nPlaintiff’s “due process rights by failing to process her grievance” in accordance with 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614; (2) “failed to cure the discrepancies, errors, and record issues prior to forwarding” the\n\nmatter to the EEOC; and (3) “failed to investigate [Plaintiff’s] claims” within the 180-day time\n\nperiod provided for in 29 C.F.R. § 1614.108. Id. at 4 (Compl. ¶¶ 15, 17, 18). Plaintiff also\n\nalleges that she “began seeking justice at the earliest possible juncture of the administrative\n\nforum.” Id. (Compl. ¶ 16).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f       USDA contends that Plaintiff’s complaint should be dismissed on the grounds that (1)\n\nPlaintiff failed timely to exhaust administrative remedies; (2) Plaintiff has failed to allege an\n\nadverse employment action with respect to Counts I and II; (3) Plaintiff has failed to allege\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive conditions to constitute a hostile work environment in Count III;\n\n(4) Plaintiff’s allegations in Count IV and V pertaining to the administrative process do not\n\nsupport an actionable claim; and (5) Plaintiff cannot state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nbecause Title VII provides an exclusive remedy against a federal agency for race-based\n\nemployment discrimination. See Dkt. 12.\n\n                                         II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Exhaustion\n\n       USDA first asserts that Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed on the basis of her failure\n\nto exhaust her administrative remedies. The EEOC has promulgated detailed regulations\n\nestablishing administrative procedures for the resolution of employment discrimination claims\n\nagainst federal agencies. A Title VII complainant must timely exhaust these administrative\n\nproceedings before filing suit in federal court, although the limits are not jurisdictional and “are\n\nsubject to equitable tolling, estoppel, and waiver.” Bowden v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"735311\"><a href=\"/opinion/735311/roy-e-bowden-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997). The D.C. Circuit has summarized the procedures applicable to Title VII claims\n\nas follows:\n\n       Under Title VII, employees who believe they have been discriminated against\n       must first consult an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Counselor within 45\n       days of the alleged discriminatory acts. 29 C.F.R. § 1614.105(a)(1). Should the\n       employee and the Counselor fail to resolve the discrimination claim within 30\n       days, the Counselor sends the employee a notice explaining the administrative\n       complaint procedure. Id. § 1614.105(d). The employee then has 15 days to file\n       an individual and/or class complaint with the employing agency. Id. § 1614.106\n       (regulations governing individual complaints); id. § 1614.204 (regulations\n       governing class complaints); see also id. § 1614.103 (noting types of complaints\n       governed by agency processing procedures outlined in regulations). Upon receipt\n\n                                                  8\n\f            of a final agency decision—known as a “FAD”—disposing of the administrative\n            complaints, the employee has either 30 days to appeal to the Equal Employment\n            Opportunity Commission (EEOC), id. §§ 1614.401(a), 1614.402(a), or 90 days to\n            file suit in federal court, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e–16(c).\n\nIn re James, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186661\"><a href=\"/opinion/186661/in-re-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 644 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “Exhaustion is required in order to give federal\n\nagencies an opportunity to handle matters internally whenever possible and to ensure that the\n\nfederal courts are burdened only when reasonably necessary.” Brown v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460997\"><a href=\"/opinion/460997/james-e-brown-v-john-o-marsh-jr-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">777</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1985). USDA contends that Plaintiff’s claims must be dismissed for lack of\n\nadministrative exhaustion because (1) she “failed to timely initiate an EEO claim within the\n\nrequired 45-day period for her discrimination claims arising in 2007 and 2008,” Dkt. 12-1 at 4;\n\nand (2) she failed to initiate any EEO counseling for discrimination claims arising in June 2009,\n\nid. at 5.\n\n         An initial clarification is in order. In its brief, USDA asserts that Plaintiff failed to\n\n“initiate an EEO claim within the 45-day period,” id. at 4 (emphasis added), that she “initiated\n\nEEO counseling on February 9, 2009,” and that “[f]or her claims to be timely, Plaintiff must\n\nhave reached out to the EEO by December 23, 2008 (45 days from February 9, 2009, counting\n\nbackward),” id. at 6. The 45-day deadline, however, pertains to the initiation of EEO counseling\n\nafter the allegedly discriminatory action, and not to the filing of a claim. See 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.105(a)(1) (requiring aggrieved person to “initiate contact with a counselor within 45 days\n\nof the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within\n\n45 days of the effective date of the action”). Thus, December 23, 2008—the date calculated by\n\nUSDA—reflects the earliest date on which a discrete act of discrimination for which EEO\n\ncounseling was initiated on February 6, 2009, could have occurred in order for Plaintiff’s claim\n\n\n\n\n                                                    9\n\fto be timely—not the date on which Plaintiff was required to file an EEO claim (or to “reach[]\n\nout to the EEO,” Dkt. 12-1 at 6). 2\n\n       USDA’s non-exhaustion defense faces two significant difficulties, both based on the fact\n\nthat failure to exhaust is a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense and thus “the defendant bears\n\nthe burden of pleading and proving it.” Bowden, 106 F.3d at 437; see also Brown, 777 F.2d at\n\n13; Dick v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

It is only after the defendant meets this burden that the burden shifts to the\n\nplaintiff to plead and prove “facts supporting equitable avoidance of the defense.” Bowden, 106\n\nF.3d at 437; see also Smith-Haynie v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184642\"><a href=\"/opinion/184642/smith-haynie-j-c-v-davis-addison/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n\n(“[A]n affirmative defense may be raised by pre-answer motion under Rule 12(b) when the facts\n\nthat give rise to the defense are clear from the face of the complaint.” (emphasis added)).\n\n       1.   ADEA Exhaustion\n\n       USDA’s first problem is that it frames its non-exhaustion defense solely in response to\n\nPlaintiff’s Title VII claims, and it relies solely on the rules applicable to Title VII cases. Dkt. 12-\n\n1 at 4–8; Dkt. 15 at 2–3. In addition to alleging violations of Title VII, however, Plaintiff’s\n\ncomplaint also alleges a violation of her rights under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act\n\n(“ADEA”), 29 U.S.C. § 621 et seq. Dkt. 1 at 2. The procedures applicable under the two\n\nstatutes, moreover, are not identical. In particular, the ADEA gives federal employees two\n\noptions for seeking judicial review. First, unlike in Title VII cases, “the employee may bring a\n\nclaim directly to federal court so long as, within 180 days of the allegedly discriminatory act,\n\n\n\n2\n   Although USDA’s brief states that Plaintiff “initiated EEO counseling on February 9, 2009,”\nDkt. 12-1 at 6, it apparently calculated the 45-day period from February 6, 2009—the date on\nwhich the document submitted by Defendant indicates that Plaintiff engaged in EEO counseling.\nId. at 1. The “February 9, 2009” date in USDA’s brief appears to be a typographical error.\n\n                                                  10\n\f[she] provides the EEOC with notice of [her] intent to sue at least 30 days before commencing\n\nsuit.” Rann v. Chao, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186053\"><a href=\"/opinion/186053/rann-robert-w-v-chao-elaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Alternatively, “the employee may\n\ninvoke the EEOC’s administrative process, and then sue if dissatisfied with the results.” Id.\n\nHere, all of USDA’s arguments are directed at the second of these options—which is also the\n\nmeans of exhausting a Title VII claim. See Dkt. 12-1 at 4–8; Dkt. 15 at 2–3; see also Brown v.\n\nGen. Servs. Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (1976) (describing Title VII exhaustion requirements).\n\nDefendant’s motion makes no mention of whether Plaintiff has complied with the first option for\n\nobtaining judicial review of an ADEA claim.\n\n       To be sure, Plaintiff has not alleged that she provided the prescribed intent-to-sue notice\n\nto the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory acts, as required under the first\n\noption, or that she waited at least 30 days after doing so to commence suit. Indeed, the record\n\nbefore the Court does not contain any suggestion that she complied with these requirements. The\n\nallocation of the burden of proof is, however, dispositive here. The D.C. Circuit and other\n\njudges on this Court have repeatedly treated failure to comply with the timeliness and exhaustion\n\nrequirements of the ADEA as a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense on which the defendant\n\nbears the burden of proof.

That is, if the option of invoking the\n\nEEOC administrative process is a non-jurisdictional, affirmative defense, as the Court of Appeals\n\nand other judges in this district have held, there is no reason to conclude that the option of\n\nnotifying the EEOC within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act, and then waiting 30 days\n\nbefore bringing suit, should be treated differently. Indeed, the option of filing a notice with the\n\nEEOC within 180 days seems, if anything, more analogous to a statute of limitations than the\n\noption of complying with the EEOC administrative process. The Court, accordingly, concludes\n\nthat the burden of pleading and demonstrating that Plaintiff failed to comply with either path to\n\njudicial review rested with USDA. Because USDA failed entirely to address the separate ADEA\n\nframework, its motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s suit for failure to exhaust must be denied as to\n\nPlaintiff’s ADEA claims. 3\n\n\n\n3\n   The D.C. Circuit has left open whether, having invoked the second path to judicial review by\nfiling an EEO complaint, the plaintiff “must reasonably pursue the [administrative] process, as\nan exhaustion requirement would ordinarily entail,” Rann, 346 F.3d at 195–96 (emphasis in\noriginal). Similarly, in Stevens v. Department of Treasury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112582\"><a href=\"/opinion/112582/stevens-v-department-of-treasury/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5–9 (1991), the Supreme\nCourt held that the petitioner had properly provided the EEOC with notice of its intent to sue—\nthat is, it had complied with the first path to judicial review. The Court then declined to reach\nthe issue of whether, having filed an EEO complaint, the petitioner was also required to exhaust\nhis administrative remedies. Id. at 9–10. The Supreme Court explained that the matter was not\nproperly before it in light of the Solicitor General’s position that “a federal employee who elects\nagency review of an age discrimination claim need not exhaust his administrative remedies\nbefore bringing a civil action.” Id. at 9. Other judges of this Court, however, have dismissed\nADEA claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies where the plaintiff filed an EEO\ncomplaint but failed to comply with the 45-day counseling requirement. See, e.g., Koch v.\n                                                   12\n\f       2. Title VII Exhaustion\n\n       Although a closer question, the Court is also unpersuaded that USDA has carried its\n\nburden of demonstrating that Plaintiff’s Title VII claims should be dismissed on exhaustion\n\ngrounds. Again, the Court’s conclusion turns on the premise that USDA bears the burden of\n\ndemonstrating that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies in a timely manner.\n\nBowden, 106 F.3d at 437; see also Brown, 777 F.2d at 13. Where a plaintiff alleges “discrete\n\nacts” of discrimination, she “can only file a charge to cover [those] discrete acts that ‘occurred’\n\nwithin the appropriate time period,” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114\n\n(2002)—here, 45 days before the initiation of EEO counseling. By contrast, “[a] charge alleging\n\na hostile work environment claim . . . will not be time barred so long as all acts which constitute\n\nthe claim are part of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one act falls within the\n\ntime period.” Id. at 122. 4\n\n       Based on Plaintiff’s statement in her March 10, 2009 EEO Complaint that she “consulted\n\nwith the USDA-EEO Counselor” on February 6, 2009, Dkt. 12-2 at 1, USDA asserts that\n\nPlaintiff failed to initiate EEO counseling prior to that date, id. at 6. Then, USDA contends that\n\n\n\nWalter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Here, even assuming without deciding that an ADEA plaintiff who invokes\nthe second path to judicial review by filing an EEO complaint must then exhaust his\nadministrative remedies, USDA has failed to meet its burden of proving that Plaintiff has not\ndone so—as explained in the next section.\n4\n  Although Morgan pertained to the deadline for filing a Title VII claim against a private\nemployer, rather than to the separate administrative deadlines applicable to claims alleged\nagainst the federal government as employer, see 536 U.S. at 104–105, courts have applied\nMorgan in the latter context as well.

Although USDA may be able to support this\n\ndefense on a more complete record, its argument fails at this preliminary stage for two reasons.\n\n       First, because the complaint itself does not contain the dates on which the alleged\n\ndiscriminatory acts occurred, USDA attempts to glean the relevant dates from the various\n\nattachments to Plaintiff’s complaint and the EEO complaint attached to USDA’s motion. It\n\nwould be premature, however, to dismiss the complaint on non-exhaustion grounds based solely\n\non USDA’s (or the Court’s) cobbling together of the apparent timing of the relevant events from\n\nthese incomplete documents. In Bowden v. United States, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the dismissal\n\nof a complaint on non-exhaustion grounds because “the pleadings and undisputed documents in\n\nthe record” established that the plaintiff had failed to notify his federal employer within 30 days\n\nof learning that it had breached a Title VII settlement agreement, and the plaintiff conceded that\n\nhe did not write to the federal agency until a year after he learned of the matter. 106 F.3d at 437.\n\nHere, in contrast, the record is less clear about when the alleged discriminatory acts occurred,\n\nand, more importantly, for how long they continued. USDA, for example, suggests that Plaintiff\n\nwaited from October 2007 until February 2009 to initiate EEO counseling with respect to her\n\nclaim that she was denied proper training and was unfairly harassed for failing timely to process\n\nfiles that another employee had also failed timely to process. Dkt. 12-1 at 6. USDA also notes\n\nthat Plaintiff “raised the lack of training” in August 2008 and complained in September 2008 that\n\nit was “unfair” to require her to submit her questions in writing—both many months prior to the\n\ncounseling she sought in February 2009. Id. at 7. None of this, however, addresses the questions\n\nwhether the allegedly discriminatory conduct was part of a continuing violation, and, if so, for\n\nhow long it continued.\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f       Second, Plaintiff’s statement in her EEO complaint that she consulted an EEO counselor\n\non February 6, 2009, does not conclusively establish that that was the only or the earliest date on\n\nwhich she did so. Absent clear support for USDA’s contention that February 6, 2009, was\n\nPlaintiff’s first consultation with an EEO counselor, the Court cannot conclude that USDA has\n\nmet its burden of proving non-exhaustion in the face of an incomplete administrative record at\n\nthe motion to dismiss stage. Indeed, while USDA relies on a statement in one document noting\n\nthat Plaintiff sought counseling on February 6, 2009, it ignores another document that suggests\n\nthat February 6, 2009 was not Plaintiff’s first contact with an EEO official. That document, a\n\nMarch 10, 2010 letter by Plaintiff’s personal representative to the head of the USDA\n\nEmployment Complaints Division, states that “several months prior” to meeting with an EEO\n\n“Counselor and later . . . filing her complaint on February 10, 2009, [Plaintiff] had at least two\n\nseparate one-on-one conversations with Ms. Myrna P. Young, Assistant Director of Alternative\n\nDispute Resolution, at USDA-APHIS” in Riverdale. Dkt. 1 at 41. 5 In Steele v. Schafer, the D.C.\n\nCircuit reversed a grant of summary judgment on non-exhaustion grounds because, while the\n\ncomplaint stated a date on which the plaintiff met with an EEO counselor, it did “not say that this\n\nwas the only period in which she contacted a counselor, and . . . other documents in the record\n\ncreate a ‘discrepancy’ regarding the first contact date.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187238\"><a href=\"/opinion/187238/steele-v-schafer/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 693 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The\n\nsame conclusion holds here as well.\n\n       USDA also argues that Plaintiff failed to exhaust her “claims of unlawful employment\n\nconduct that allegedly occurred in June 2009” because she “failed to initiate any EEO\n\ncounseling” relating to that post-February 2009 conduct. Dkt. 12-1 at 7–8. It is far from clear,\n\n\n\n\n5\n A subsequent letter by Plaintiff’s personal representative to the Office of Adjudication refers to\nMyrna Young as the “EEO Director.” Id. at 44.\n                                                 15\n\fhowever, that the complaint alleges claims based on post-February 2009 conduct. Moreover, to\n\nthe extent that it alleges that the pre-February 2009 conduct continued after February 2009, there\n\nis no reason that USDA’s alleged failure to redress any allegedly ongoing discriminatory conduct\n\nshould insulate that conduct from review. And, as discussed further below, the Court concludes\n\nthat the complaint does not adequately allege a claim with respect to the one discrete allegation\n\nof discrimination that apparently occurred after February 2009—the search of Plaintiff’s\n\nemployment records to determine her retirement date. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 9).\n\n       Finally, USDA contends that Plaintiff has conceded the exhaustion issue because her\n\nopposition to its motion to dismiss does not address Defendant’s arguments. See Dkt. 15 at 2–3.\n\nPlaintiff’s brief is not by any means a model of clarity, and it largely recounts the allegations in\n\nher March 10, 2009 and May 1, 2009 EEO Complaints. Pro se pleadings, however, must “be\n\nliberally construed,” Fed. Exp. Corp., 552 U.S. at 402, and Plaintiff’s brief does allude to two\n\npotentially responsive arguments: that (1) she experienced “recurring harassment and ridiculing\n\nthat continued from 2007 to 2009”; and that (2) she “met with her supervisors and then with\n\n[Civil Rights Enforcement and Compliance] office personnel who all should have been logically\n\nconnected with the EEO program,” although the timing of these meetings is far from clear. Dkt.\n\n14 at 15. If Plaintiff were responding to a motion for summary judgment that was supported by\n\nevidence and a statement of undisputed material facts, her response might not suffice. Cf.\n\nMatsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111620\"><a href=\"/opinion/111620/matsushita-electric-industrial-co-ltd-v-zenith-radio-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (1986) (the party opposing\n\nsummary judgment “must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to\n\nthe material facts”); Latson, 82 F. Supp. 3d at 386–87. Here, however, the question is not\n\nwhether Plaintiff has come forward with evidence to rebut a prima facie showing that the\n\nmaterial facts are not in dispute. Rather, the question is merely whether she has conceded non-\n\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fexhaustion at the pleading stage, and the Court concludes that she has not. Although short on\n\ndetail, Plaintiff has responded, and her arguments are facially plausible. 6\n\nB. Adequacy of Plaintiff’s Allegations\n\n        Next, Defendant asserts that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be\n\ngranted because (1) Counts I and II do not allege an adverse employment action as required for a\n\ndisparate treatment claim; (2) Count III does not include allegations that are sufficiently severe\n\nor pervasive to constitute a hostile work environment; (3) Count III is also deficient because\n\nTitle VII preempts her claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1981; and (4) Counts IV and V pertain to the\n\nagency’s processing of her administrative complaint, which is not independently actionable.\n\n        In considering USDA’s motion to dismiss, the Court is guided by the overarching rule\n\nthat a complaint must “give the defendant fair notice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds\n\nupon which it rests.” Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (2007) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ A claim has facial\n\n\n\n6\n  A number of judges in this jurisdiction have held that the EEO counseling requirement may be\nsatisfied by raising one’s claims with supervisors or management.

This allegation fails to state a claim because it does not “give the defendant fair\n\nnotice of what the . . . claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.” Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555.\n\nMost significantly, Plaintiff does not allege that she herself sought and was denied career\n\nopportunities that were provided to others; she alleges only that other employees received\n\n“multiple career opportunities” notwithstanding unspecified complaints about them. Dkt. 1 at 2\n\n(Compl. ¶ 7). Plaintiff’s allegation that USDA “provided multiple favorable career\n\nopportunities” to a Caucasian employee “when she complained” but “harassed” Plaintiff when\n\nshe “expressed any workplace concerns” fails for the same reasons. Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 9). 7\n\nEven if more factual support for these allegations might be gleaned from the documents\n\nappended to the complaint, the Court is unable to identify any allegation that Plaintiff was denied\n\nany specific “career opportunity” because of her race, sex, or age.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  This allegation also fails to state a claim if construed as a retaliation claim. Plaintiff does not\nprovide more than a conclusory statement that she “expressed . . . workplace concerns,” Dkt. 1 at\n3 (Compl. ¶ 9), which is insufficient to state a plausible claim that “she engaged in a statutorily\nprotected activity,” Brody, 199 F.3d at 452.\n                                                 20\n\f        To the extent that Plaintiff merely points to the criticism that she allegedly faced due to\n\nher failure to “comply with office and agency policies” and due to the unspecified complaints\n\nthat she made, that type of intangible injury is insufficient to satisfy the adverse employment\n\naction requirement for a disparate treatment claim.

She does\n\nnot allege that she, as a result, was required to work longer hours, that she was denied a bonus or\n\npromotion based on her failure to complete her assignments, or that she suffered any other\n\nconcomitant “adverse change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of [her] employment.”\n\nMack, 134 F.

Accordingly, at least as currently pled, this claim also fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f        In her brief in opposition to USDA’s motion to dismiss, Plaintiff suggests that “recurring\n\nhostility . . . and other incidents . . . pressured” her to retire early. Dkt. 14 at 20–21. To the\n\nextent that she now argues that she was constructively discharged, that claim is not included in\n\nthe complaint. See Lempert v. Rice, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Rather, the only non-conclusory allegation in the complaint that\n\nmight support such a claim is the allegation that the agency searched Plaintiff’s personnel\n\nrecords to obtain the date that she would be eligible to retire and “used that date as part of its\n\nresolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire years prior to her anticipate[d] date.” Dkt. 1 at 3\n\n(Compl. ¶ 9). From the cross-referenced material, it appears that Plaintiff is referring to the\n\nagency’s efforts to settle the dispute as part of the EEO process. See e.g., Dkt. 1 at 11. In\n\nresponse, USDA argues that this communication is protected under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n408 as an offer of compromise. Dkt. 12-1 at 8 n.2. The Court, however, need not reach that\n\nissue, because the allegation in the complaint is too vague to state a claim for constructive\n\ndischarge, even in light of the liberal pleading rules applicable to pro se litigants. See Fed. Exp.\n\nCorp., 552 U.S. at 402. Indeed, the complaint never even alleges that Plaintiff actually left\n\nUSDA. That fact can only be inferred from the attachments to the complaint, which suggest that\n\nPlaintiff did not retire until late 2010, long after she filed her February, March, and May 2009\n\nEEO complaints. Dkt. 1 at 17, 51. Absent specific factual allegations contained in the complaint\n\nabout whether, when, and why Plaintiff retired, the complaint cannot reasonably be construed to\n\nstate a claim for constructive discharge. Cf. Pa. State Police v.

Hostile Work Environment Claim\n\n        USDA also argues that Plaintiff’s allegations fail to state a hostile work environment\n\nclaim because they “do not rise to the level of severity or pervasiveness” required for such a\n\nclaim. Dkt. 12-1 at 11. To state a hostile work environment claim, the Plaintiff need not allege a\n\n“tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.”\n\nFaragher v. City of Boca Raton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118245\"><a href=\"/opinion/118245/faragher-v-boca-raton/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">775</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 807–08 (1998). Rather, a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim requires a showing of harassment that, “to be actionable, . . . must be\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the victim’s] employment and [to]\n\ncreate an abusive working environment.” Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111712\"><a href=\"/opinion/111712/meritor-savings-bank-fsb-v-vinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67\n\n(1986) (internal quotation marks omitted) (first alteration in original). To meet this test, an\n\n“objectionable environment must be both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a\n\nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in fact did perceive to be\n\nso.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787. Courts, accordingly, “look[] to the totality of the circumstances,\n\nincluding the frequency of the discriminatory conduct, its severity, its offensiveness, and whether\n\nit interferes with an employee’s work performance.” Baloch v. Kempthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187264\"><a href=\"/opinion/187264/baloch-v-kempthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n        A number of Plaintiff’s allegations could potentially fall under the hostile work\n\nenvironment rubric. Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) did not provide her “training or proper\n\nguidance,” Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 8); (2) “harassed and criticized” her for not processing cases\n\nwithin guidelines, id.; (3) “harassed” her when she “expressed any workplace concerns,”\n\nincluding “taking the liberty to search for personal data about plaintiff’s eligible date to retire”\n\nand using it “as part of its resolution to intimidate [Plaintiff] to retire,” id. (Compl. ¶ 9); (4)\n\n“failed to timely resolve the recurring complaints of inappropriate behavior and sexual\n\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fharassment charges about the one GS-13 Caucasian male that created unsuitable work\n\nconditions,” id. (Compl. ¶ 11); (5) “failed to use its own policies to execute . . . remedial action\n\nto secure plaintiff’s rights . . . to work in a healthy harassment-free environment,” id. at 3–4\n\n(Compl. ¶ 12); and (6) “harras[ed] [Plaintiff] not to ask work-related questions,” id. at 4 (Compl.\n\n¶ 13). The Court concludes, however, that these allegations fail to state a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim with sufficient factual specificity.\n\n       Unspecified claims of “harassment,” “inappropriate behavior,” and “unsuitable”\n\nconditions are the sort of “mere conclusory statements” that the court need not accept as true\n\nwhen weighing the plausibility of the plaintiff’s complaint. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. Although a\n\nplaintiff need not at this stage provide an exhaustive account of the offensive conduct to which\n\nshe was allegedly subjected, a complaint—even a pro se one—must contain “sufficient factual\n\nmatter” for the Court to conclude that relief is plausible and to put the Defendant on notice of the\n\nclaim. Id. To the extent that the forgoing allegations include any factual detail, those facts do\n\nnot establish the type of severe or pervasive harassment necessary to state a claim for hostile\n\nwork environment. Faragher, 524 U.S. at 787–78. “Title VII is not a general civility code for\n\nthe American workplace, nor does it serve as a remedy for all instances of verbal or physical\n\nharassment for it does not ‘purge the workplace of vulgarity.’” Stewart v.

Rather, “conduct\n\nmust be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment,” Faragher,\n\n524 U.S. at 788, and “a few isolated incidents of offensive conduct do not amount to actionable\n\nharassment,” Stewart, 275 F.3d at 1134.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 25\n\f       Here, many of Plaintiff’s allegations constitute either “legal conclusions” or “conclusory\n\nstatements,” which will not suffice to state a claim. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. And, where Plaintiff\n\ndoes provide more detail, those allegations do not rise to the “extreme” level required to alter\n\n“the terms and conditions of employment.” Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788. Most notably, the\n\ncomplaint alleges that “[t]he entire staff of supervisors and subordinates of all . . . ethnic groups\n\n. . . communicated with each other . . . via e-mail and [by] asking work-related questions,” while\n\nPlaintiff was required to pose only handwritten questions to her supervisor. Dkt. 1 at 4 (Compl.\n\n¶ 13). Even putting aside the problem that this allegation asserts that employees “of all ethnic\n\ngroups” were treated alike and that it was simply Plaintiff who was singled out, id., it fails to\n\nmeet the “demanding standard” for alleging a hostile work environment claim, Smith v. De Novo\n\nLegal, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Although cumbersome and potentially\n\nembarrassing, the requirement that Plaintiff submit handwritten questions was not so extreme\n\nthat it, in effect, altered the terms or conditions of Plaintiff’s employment. She does not allege\n\nthat the requirement “unreasonably interfere[d] with [her] work performance,” Stewart, 275 F.3d\n\nat 1133–34, or that it created an objectively caustic or offensive environment, cf. Burkes v.\n\nHolder, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Finally, although\n\nsome of the exhibits in this case allude to what may indeed be troubling work conditions, it is not\n\nthe Court’s role to determine which statements contained in the attachments might supplement\n\nPlaintiff’s conclusory allegations.

Accordingly, Plaintiff’s hostile work environment claim cannot stand as currently\n\npled.\n\n        3. Administrative Process Claims\n\n        Plaintiff makes several allegations relating to the administrative processing of her\n\ndiscrimination complaint in Count V under the heading “Retaliation Claims.” See Dkt. 1 at 4. In\n\nthat count, Plaintiff alleges that USDA (1) “violated [her] due process rights by failing to process\n\nher grievance in accordance with the Commission’s regulations, rules, and procedures . . . under\n\n29 C.F.R. 1614,” id. (Compl. ¶ 15); (2) “failed to cure the discrepancies, errors, and record issues\n\nprior to forwarding [her] grievance . . . to EEOC[] for action,” id. (Compl. ¶ 17); and (3) “failed\n\nto investigate [her] claims filed against them within the 180-day requirement,” id. (Compl. ¶ 18).\n\nIn Counts III and IV, Plaintiff also alleges that “the claims USDA identified for investigation\n\nexcluded [Plaintiff’s]” harassment and hostile work environment claims “for which she was\n\ncounseled.” Id. at 3–4 (Compl. ¶¶ 10, 14) (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  27\n\f       These allegations fail to state a claim. First, USDA’s alleged failure to follow the EEOC\n\nregulations regarding the administrative processing of her claim is not actionable. As the D.C.\n\nCircuit has explained, there is “no cause of action . . . for challenges to [administrative]\n\nprocessing of [an employment discrimination] claim.” Smith v. Casellas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744047\"><a href=\"/opinion/744047/michael-smith-v-gilbert-f-casellas-chairman-equal-employment/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1997) (per curiam). Rather, a plaintiff’s ability to “bring a Title VII action directly against\n\nhis or her employer [is] . . . the remedy for any improper [administrative] handling of a\n\ndiscrimination charge.” Id. Should the agency fail to take timely action on a Title VII\n\ncomplaint, the remedy available to the plaintiff is to file suit against her employer in federal\n\ncourt after seeking to exhaust remedies and waiting the required period of time. 29 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1614.407(b).\n\n       Second, Plaintiff’s claims fare no better when framed as a Due Process challenge, since\n\nany procedural flaws in the administrative process did not deprive her of a property or liberty\n\ninterest protected by the Constitution. See, e.g., Council of the Blind of Del. Cty. Valley v.\n\nRegan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1533 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“The agency’s failure to follow the applicable\n\nrules is relevant to a due process claim only if the agency’s action deprives the plaintiff of life,\n\nliberty, or property. In the present case it does not.” (emphasis in original)). As noted above,\n\nthe employee’s judicial remedies remain available, regardless of whether the agency or EEOC\n\nhas properly addressed the administrative complaint. And to the extent that Plaintiff is alleging\n\nthat the agency retaliated against her by improperly processing her administrative charge, she\n\nalso fails to state a claim because improper administrative processing “has no discernable\n\nnegative consequences for plaintiff’s employment.” Stewart, 275 F.3d at 1136.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  28\n\f       4. Section 1981 Claim\n\n       Finally, although it is unclear whether Plaintiff even sought to raise a claim under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981, USDA argues that Plaintiff has failed to state such a claim. The complaint makes\n\na passing reference to “plaintiff’s rights governed under Title 42 U.S.C.A. 1981 to work in a\n\nhealthy harassment-free environment,” Dkt. 1 at 3 (Compl. ¶ 12), but expressly identifies her\n\nclaims as arising under Title VII and ADEA, id. at 1–2 (Compl. ¶¶ 3–4). In any event, Plaintiff\n\ncannot bring a claim that her federal government employer engaged in race-based discrimination\n\nunder § 1981. “[Section] 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as added by § 11 of the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-16 (1970 ed., Supp. IV), [is] the\n\nexclusive individual remedy available to a federal employee complaining of job-related racial\n\ndiscrimination.” Brown, 425 U.S. at 824–25.\n\n                                     III.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The Court concludes that, although USDA has failed to meet its burden of proving non-\n\nexhaustion, Plaintiff’s complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim. This dismissal is\n\nwithout prejudice. If Plaintiff is able to modify her complaint in a manner that addresses the\n\ndeficiencies discussed above, she may file an amended complaint on or before February 1, 2016.\n\nAn accompanying order is filed concurrently with this opinion.\n\n\n                                                     /s/ Randolph D.
