CRAVEN, MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA\nSENATE, has requested an opinion on the following question:\n\n               In calculating the allocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but\ndoes not assume all service responsibilities for its territory, are the calculations to include (1) funds\ncarried over to the prior fiscal year from a previous year or (2) funds derived from charges for\nlicenses, permits, and such services as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other\ngovernmental agencies?\n\n                                            CONCLUSION\n\n               In calculating the allocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but\ndoes not assume all service responsibilities for its territory, the calculations are not to include (1)\nfunds carried over to the prior fiscal year from a previous year or (2) funds derived from charges for\nlicenses, permits, and such services as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other\ngovernmental agencies where the charges are levied specifically to offset the cost of the particular\nservices and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the services.\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\n                Since the addition of article XIII A to the Constitution in 1978, the distribution of\nproperty tax revenues to cities, counties, and special districts has been subject to and controlled by\na statutory allocation formula. (See Rev. & Tax. Code, §§ 93-100; Amador Valley Joint Union High\nSch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization (1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 218; American Canyon Fire Protection\n\fDist. v. County of Napa (1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 100, 105-106; 70 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 87, 88 (1987).)\n\n                While many factors are considered in the property tax distribution calculations, the\nLegislature has given particular attention to the amount of services furnished by each local agency\nto the area generating the property taxes.1 When these service responsibilities are transferred from\none governmental agency to another, such as when a new city incorporates and assumes the service\nresponsibilities for its area, the amount of property tax revenues received by the affected agencies\nalso changes under the Legislature's allocation formula.\n\n                 The question presented for resolution concerns the incorporation of a city that does\nnot assume responsibility for all services previously furnished to its territory. The county and\nspecial districts will continue to provide a limited number of services to the area. Government Code\nsection 568422 governs the transfer of property tax revenues in such circumstances. It provides in\npart:\n\n               \"(a) If the proposal includes the incorporation of a city, as defined in Section\n       56043, or the formation of a district, as defined in Section 2215 of the Revenue and\n       Taxation Code, the commission shall determine the amount of property tax revenue\n       to be exchanged by the affected local agency pursuant to this section.\n\n               \"(b) The commission shall notify the county auditor of the proposal and the\n       services which the new jurisdiction proposes to assume within the area, and identify\n       for the auditor the existing service providers within the area subject to the proposal.\n\n               \"(c) If the proposal would not transfer all of an affected agency's service\n       responsibilities to the proposed city or district, the commission and the county\n       auditor shall do all of the following:\n\n               \"(1) The county auditor shall determine the proportion that the amount of\n       property tax revenue derived by each affected local agency pursuant to subdivision\n       (b) of Section 93 of the Revenue and Taxation Code bears to the total amount of\n       revenue from all sources, available for general purposes, received by each affected\n       local agency in the prior fiscal year. For purposes of making this determination and\n       the determination required by paragraph (3), 'total amount of revenue from all\n\n\n   1\n    For a particular area, such services as police and fire protection, water, sewage disposal, road\nmaintenance, street lighting, trash collection, and mosquito abatement, as well as the operation\nof such facilities as a bus system, parks, flood control projects, cemeteries, airports, libraries, and\nswimming pools may be divided among a county, city, and several special districts. (See, e.g.,\nGov. Code, § 61600; Health & Saf. Code, § 4113; Pub. Resources Code, § 5782.2; Wat. Code, §\n35401.)\n   2\n    All references hereafter to the Government Code are by section number only.\n\n                                                  2.                                              88-603\n\n\f          sources available for general purposes' means the total amount of revenue which an\n          affected local agency may use on a discretionary basis for any purpose and does not\n          include any of the following:\n\n                 \"(A) Revenue which, by statute, is required to be used for a specific purpose.\n\n                  \"(B) Revenue from fees, charges, or assessments which are levied to\n          specifically offset the cost of particular services and do not exceed the cost\n          reasonably borne in providing these services.\n\n                 \"(C) Revenue received from the federal government which is required to be\n          used for a specific purpose.\n\n                  \"(2) The commission shall determine, based on information submitted by\n          each affected local agency, an amount equal to the total net cost to each affected\n          local agency during the prior fiscal year of providing those services which the new\n          jurisdiction will assume within the area subject to the proposal. For purposes of this\n          paragraph, 'total net cost' means the total cost which was funded by general purpose\n          revenues of the affected local agency and excludes any portion of the total cost\n          which was funded by any revenues of that agency which are specified in\n          subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1).\n\n                  \"(3) The commission shall multiply the amount determined pursuant to\n          paragraph (2) for each affected local agency by the corresponding proportion\n          determined pursuant to paragraph (1) to derive the amount of property tax revenue\n          used to provide services by each affected local agency during the prior fiscal year\n          within the area subject to the proposal.\n\n                 \". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n                  \"(e) The executive officer shall notify the auditor of the amount determined\n          pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) . . . at the time the executive officer\n          records a certificate of completion pursuant to Section 57203 for any proposal\n          described in subdivision (a), and the auditor shall transfer that amount to the new\n          jurisdiction.\" (Emphases added.)3\n\n\n\n   3\n       The \"commission\" is the local agency formation commission established for the county.\n\n      Revenue and Taxation Code section 93, subdivision (b) states: \"A county shall levy an ad\nvalorem property tax on taxable assessed property,\" with the revenue \"distributed . . . . to local\nagencies, school districts, county superintendents of schools, and community college districts in\naccordance with the provisions of the Government Code.\"\n\n                                                    3.                                             88-603\n\n\fThe question is: are the calculations of section 56842 to include (1) funds carried over to the prior\nfiscal year from a previous year or (2) funds derived from charges for licenses, permits, and such\nservices as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other governmental agencies? We\nconclude that they are not.\n\n                In analyzing section 56842, we first note that cities, counties, and special districts are\nable to obtain funds from a variety of sources other than property taxes. Indeed, because article XIII\nA of the Constitution places a limitation upon the collection of property taxes, the Legislature has\nencouraged local governments to seek alternative methods of financing their community services.\n(See § 16270; Marin Hospital Dist. v. Rothman (1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 495, 499-500; 70\nOps.Cal.Atty.Gen. 87, 88 (1987).) Besides receiving grants from the federal government and the\nstate, local agencies may generate revenues from such sources as regulatory fees, user charges,\nspecial assessments, and special taxes. (See §§ 25210.77a, 26400, 54985; San Marcos Water Dist.\nv. San Marcos Unified School Dist. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 154, 160-165; J. W. Jones Companies v. City\nof San Diego (1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 745, 752-757; Mills v. County of Trinity (1980) 108\nCal.App.3d 656, 659-660; Dare v. Lakeport City Council (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 864, 868-869; 70\nOps.Cal.Atty.Gen. 153, 155-156 (1987); 70 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 87, 88 (1987).)\n\n               Although the calculations of section 56842 govern the transfer of property tax\nrevenues from one local agency to another, they are based in part upon the receipt of other types of\nrevenues available to fund the services to be transferred. When this formula language was\nincorporated into the provisions of section 56842 in 1986 (Stats. 1986, ch. 956, § 1), the report of\nthe Senate Local Government Committee explained its operation and effect as follows:\n\n                \"When a new city or special district takes over all the service responsibilities\n        of an existing local agency, Assembly Bill 672 requires the local agency formation\n        commission (LAFCO) to request the county auditor to determine the property tax\n        revenues generated by the existing agency. AB 672 then requires the county auditor\n        to transfer that amount to the new city or district.\n\n                \"When a new city or special district takes over some but not all of an existing\n        local agency's services, AB 672 requires the county auditor to determine the\n        relationship between the existing agency's property tax revenues and its total general\n        purpose revenues. LAFCO then determines the total net cost of each service which\n        the new city or district will assume. Then LAFCO multiplies the net cost by the\n        property tax ratio to determine how much property tax revenue will go to the new\n        city or district. The bill requires the county auditor to transfer that amount to the\n        new city or district.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4.                                              88-603\n\n\f       The section 56842 formula may be described in the following terms:\n\n               (1)                             (2)                             (3)\n\n          tax receipts                       cost of                       taxes to be\n        general revenue           x         services          =            transferred\n           receipts                        transferred\n\nIf, for example, general revenues were received by a special district in the amount of $1,000,000\nduring the prior fiscal year, of which $600,000 constituted property tax receipts, and its net cost of\nservices to be assumed by the new city was $100,000 for the prior fiscal year, $60,000 in property\ntax revenues would be transferred from the special district to the new city. The calculations would\nbe:\n\n          $600,000                x         $100,000          =             $60,000\n         $1,000,000\n\nIf the total general revenue receipts had been larger, such as $1,200,000, the property tax revenue\nproportion would be reduced and accordingly a lesser amount in taxes would be transferred. The\ncalculations would be:\n\n          $600,000                x         $100,000          =             $50,000\n         $1,200,000\n\n               It is apparent that the new city will not require as much in property taxes if general\nrevenues are readily available from other sources. The affected transferring agency, on the other\nhand, will no longer need those property taxes previously used to fund the transferred services.\n\n                Of particular significance is the fact that excluded from the calculations of section\n56842 are funds required under state or federal law to be used for a specific purpose and funds\nreceived to offset certain costs of various services. These revenues will continue to be received by\nthe transferring agency or begin to be received by the new city to the extent each furnishes the\nspecified services. Neither is thus pertinent to a determination of what property tax revenues should\nbe transferred between the two entities.\n\n               A. Carry-Over Funds\n\n                The first part of the question concerns funds that have been carried over to the prior\nfiscal year from a previous fiscal year. Do these funds constitute \"revenue . . . received . . . in the\nprior fiscal year\"?\n\n                A common definition of \"revenue\" is \"the annual or periodical yield of taxes, excises,\ncustoms, duties, and other sources of income that a nation, state, or municipality collects and\nreceives into the treasury for public use.\" (Webster's New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1971) p. 1942.)\n\n                                                  5.                                           88-603\n\n\fIt is a source or sources of payment, consideration, or income. (See §§ 23800, 26400.) To \"receive\"\nis \"to take possession or delivery of . . . to take in . . . acquire.\" (Webster's, supra, p. 1894.) On the\nother hand, to \"carry over\" funds is \"to hold over . . . for another season\" or to carry forward that\nwhich has already been received. (Id. at p. 344.)\n\n                Under these definitions of the terms used by the Legislature, the carry-over funds\nhere do not constitute revenue received in the prior fiscal year. It was in the year previous to the\nprior fiscal year that they were received and delivered into the treasury for a public purpose. We\nfind no basis for counting them twice as a source of payment; they were merely being retained for\nan additional time period, waiting to be appropriated. We are directed to interpret the words of a\nstatute by \"giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\" (Committee of Seven Thousand v.\nSuperior Court (1988) 45 Cal.3d 491, 501; Schmidt v. Superior Court (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1060, 1065-\n1066; Young v. Haines (1986) 41 Cal.3d 883, 897.)\n\n                This construction of section 56842 is also consistent with other legislative acts\nindicating that revenues are \"received\" only once and thereafter are retained in reserve, designated\nto a specific reserve, transferred to a different account, or appropriated. (See §§ 29085, 29086,\n29092, 29124, 29125, 29126.1, 29130.) \"[E]very statute should be construed with reference to the\nwhole system of law of which it is a part, so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\" (Moore\nv. Panish (1982) 32 Cal.3d 535, 541.)\n\n               Including carry-over funds in the section 56842 calculations would not provide the\nnew city with sufficient property tax revenues to finance the services transferred. The city would\nnot have accumulated carry-over funds to finance the services. Instead it must look to new sources\nof revenue. The statutory formula contemplates that the city will have the same general authority\nto generate funds as the transferring agency. Carry-over funds do not meet the test of ready\navailability.\n\n                It should be noted that the formula contained in section 56842 restricts consideration\nof the tax receipts as well as the general revenue receipts to those of the prior fiscal year. This\nprovides consistency and bases the calculations on the most recent experience in financing the\nservices in question. To include carry-over funds in the general revenue receipts category would\nopen up the fraction denominator of the formula while the numerator remained restricted.\nUniformity would be lost, and more remote and additional periods would be considered that failed\nto reflect the current ability of either the transferring agency or the city to generate funds.\n\n                 Finally, our conclusion effectuates the purpose of section 56842 as expressed in\nsubdivision (c)(3): \"to derive the amount of property tax revenue used to provide services . . . during\nthe prior fiscal year within the area.\" The Legislature has used a collective approach in determining\nthe amount of tax receipts and general revenue receipts used to fund the particular services. Such\nformula eliminates extraordinary situations and instead focuses on the general manner in which the\ntransferring agency did (and the new city presumably will be able to) generate funds to finance the\nservices. Again, carry-over funds have no place in such calculations. We follow the primary rule\nof statutory construction \"to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\" (People v. Woodhead\n\n                                                   6.                                             88-603\n\n\f(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007; People v. Jeffers (1987) 43 Cal.3d 984, 993; People v. Overstreet\n(1986) 42 Cal.3d 891, 895.)\n\n                We thus conclude in answer to the first part of the question that in calculating the\nallocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but does not assume all service\nresponsibilities for its territory, the calculations are not to include funds carried over to the prior\nfiscal year from a previous year.\n\n                B. Charges For Licenses, Permits, and Services\n\n                The second part of the question concerns charges for licenses, permits, and such\nservices as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other governmental agencies. Are\nthese included in or excluded from the section 56842 calculations? We conclude that they are\nexcluded to the extent they did not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the particular\nservices.\n\n                 These charges were \"received by each affected local agency in the prior fiscal year.\"\nWe believe that they were also \"available for general purposes\" and used \"on a discretionary basis\nfor any purpose.\" The fact that the charges were generated by particular activities does not mean\nthat they were required to be segregated by the affected agency and used only to fund the same kinds\nof activities that generated them. Here neither the state nor the federal government has required by\nstatute that the charges were to be used for a specific purpose. The sources of the charges did not\nlimit the local agency's ability to spend the moneys received as it chose.\n\n                 While these charges would thus meet the general test for inclusion in the section\n56842 calculations, the Legislature has also specified certain exclusions.4 The exclusion applicable\nhere is for \"fees, charges, or assessments which are levied to specifically offset the cost of particular\nservices and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing these services.\" (§ 56842, subd.\n(c)(1)(B).)\n\n                 The term \"levied\" has different meanings depending upon its context. (See\nHuntington Park Redevelopment Agency v. Martin (1985) 38 Cal.3d 100, 106-107; People v.\nSchwartz (1947) 31 Cal.2d 59, 63-64; Hayne v. San Francisco (1917) 174 Cal. 185, 196; Bell\nCommunity Redevelopment Agency v. Woosley (1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 24, 32; Alpha Beta Acme\nMarkets, Inc. v. City of Whittier (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 16, 21-22; Fahey v. City Council (1962)\n208 Cal.App.2d 667, 677-679; McDonald v. Richards (1926) 79 Cal.App.1, 7.) It may refer to the\nlegislative act of setting the amount to be collected (Wardell v. State of California (1947) 29 Cal.2d\n639, 642-643; People v. Mahoney (1939) 13 Cal.2d 729, 735-736; Fahey v. City Council, supra, 208\n\n\n   4\n    \"The Legislature has power to prescribe legal definitions of its own language, and when an\nact passed by the Legislature embodies a definition it is binding on the courts.\" (In re Marriage\nof Stephens (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 909, 913.) We accordingly follow the definitions in section\n56842 that are applicable to its terms.\n\n                                                   7.                                            88-603\n\n\fCal.App.2d 667, 677-679; Smith v. Byer (1960) 179 Cal.App.2d 118, 121) or the ministerial act of\ncollecting the amount previously determined (Hayne v. San Francisco, supra, 174 Cal. 185, 195-196;\nAlpha Beta Acme Markets, Inc. v. City of Whittier, supra, 262 Cal.App.2d 16, 22; McDonald v.\nRichards, supra, 79 Cal.App. 1, 7-8). Usually what is being levied is referred to as a \"tax\" (see City\nof Burbank v. Metropolitan Water District (1960) 180 Cal.App.2d 451, 459), but fees and charges\nfor services furnished may also be referred to as being levied (see § 54985; Dare v. Lakeport City\nCouncil (1970) 12 Cal.App.3d 864, 868-869).\n\n                  Here section 56842 refers to \"[r]evenue from fees, charges, or assessments which are\nlevied . . .\" as an exception to \"revenue from all sources . . . received by each effected local agency\nin the prior fiscal year.\" In such context, accordingly, the term \"levied\" would include the\nadministrative collection function of receiving the money into the public treasury. (See People ex\nrel. Happell v. Sischo (1943) 23 Cal.2d 478, 493; County of Fresno v. Malmstrom (1979) 94\nCal.App.3d 974, 979.)\n\n                In order to be excluded from the calculations, the license, permit, and service charges\nmust be \"levied to specifically offset the cost of the particular services\" and \"not exceed the cost\nreasonably borne in providing these services.\" With respect to license and permit charges, we\nbelieve that the term \"services\" would appropriately cover those services associated with the license\nor permit being issued, such as administering, regulating, and enforcing the licensing or permit\nprogram. (See United Business Com. v. City of San Diego (1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 156, 165-167.)\n\n                In this regard, we note that whether charges \"exceed the cost reasonably borne in\nproviding the services\" is significant not only for applying the provisions of section 56842 but also\nfor purposes of the tax limitations of article XIII A of the Constitution (see Pennell v. City of San\nJose (1986) 42 Cal.3d 365, 374-375; Terminal Plaza Corp. v. City and County of San Francisco\n(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 892, 906-907; Briarwood Properties, Ltd. v. City of Los Angeles (1985) 171\nCal.App.3d 1020, 1021-1032; Beaumont Investors v. Beaumont-Cherry Valley Water Dist. (1985)\n165 Cal.App.3d 227, 234; Mills v. County of Trinity (1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 656, 662-663) and the\ngovernment spending limitations of article XIII B of the Constitution (see Huntington Park\nRedevelopment Agency v. Martin, supra, 38 Cal.3d 100, 107; County of Placer v. Corin (1980) 113\nCal.App.3d 443, 451-452). In keeping with these constitutional limitations, the Legislature has\nspecifically authorized local governments to levy charges in various situations if the charges are\nlimited to covering the costs incurred. (See, e.g., § 54985 [\"in the amount reasonably necessary to\nrecover the cost of providing any product or service or the cost of enforcing any regulation for which\nthe fee or charge is levied\"].)\n\n                 Since a local government may also exercise a revenue raising power without regard\nto the specific service costs involved (see The Pines v. City of Santa Monica (1981) 29 Cal.3d 656,\n660-663; United Business Com. v. City of San Diego, supra, 91 Cal.App.3d 156, 165-169; 70\nOps.Cal.Atty.Gen. 153, 155-156 (1987)), the determination of whether a particular charge is limited\nto the reimbursement of costs incurred would depend upon the facts of each case. Normally courts\nhave looked to the language of the ordinance imposing the fee and to cost analysis reports and\nstudies prepared by government officials in concluding that a particular fee is for cost\n\n                                                  8.                                           88-603\n\n\freimbursement or revenue raising purposes. (See United Business Com. v. City of San Diego, supra,\n91 Cal.App.3d 156, 165-168; Oakland Raiders v. City of Berkeley (1976) 65 Cal.App.3d 623, 627;\nWatson v. County of Merced (1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 263, 268; Arnke v. City of Berkeley (1960)\n185 Cal.App.2d 842, 847.)\n\n                With respect to revenues received pursuant to a contract for services, the existence\nof the contract would not itself preclude the charges from being \"levied\" (set and collected) for\npurposes of section 56842. While the contract could conceivably produce \"excess revenue\" over\nthe costs of the services provided, we note that certain statutory restrictions may be applicable to\nprevent such a consequence. Section 51350, for example, states in part:\n\n               \"A county which provides services through its appropriate departments,\n       boards, commissions, officers or employees, to any city pursuant to contract or as\n       authorized by law, shall charge the city all those costs which are incurred in\n       providing the services so contracted or authorized. A county shall not charge a city\n       contracting for a particular service, either as a direct or an indirect overhead charge,\n       any portion of those costs which are attributable to services made available to all\n       portions of the county, as determined by resolution of the board of supervisors, or\n       which are general overhead costs of operation of the county government. General\n       overhead costs, for the purpose of this section, are those costs which a county would\n       incur regardless of whether or not it provided a service under contract to a city.\"\n\n The same considerations in determining the costs incurred would thus be applicable for contract\nservices as for license and permit programs.\n\n                Our conclusion that license, permit, and contract service charges are excludable from\nthe section 56842 calculations helps facilitate an equitable transfer of property tax revenues. An\naffected agency that is able to offset its costs of issuing licenses and permits and furnishing contract\nservices does not need property tax revenues to fund such activities. By following the same\npractices, the new city would not need property tax revenues for performing these activities. Hence,\nneither local government would have claim to include these funds in the section 56842 calculations.\nTo the extent that the charges exceed the reasonable costs of the governmental activities that\nproduce them, they would properly be included in \"the total amount of revenue from all sources,\navailable for general purposes.\" Such circumstances would mean that a lesser amount of property\ntaxes would be transferred to the new city--the affected agency would retain a greater share of the\nproperty taxes (having lost a possible source of generating excess revenues) and the city would\nobtain a lesser share of them (having gained a possible source of generating excess revenues).\n\n                 In answer to the second part of the question, therefore, we conclude that in\ncalculating the allocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but does not assume all\nservice responsibilities for its territory, the calculations do not include funds derived from charges\nfor licenses, permits, and such services as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other\ngovernmental agencies where the charges are levied to specifically offset the cost of the particular\nservices and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the services.\n\n                                                  9.                                              88-603\n\n\f* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n   10.       88-603\n\n\f",

The county and\nspecial districts will continue to provide a limited number of services to the area. Government Code\nsection 568422 governs the transfer of property tax revenues in such circumstances. It provides in\npart:\n\n               \"(a) If the proposal includes the incorporation of a city, as defined in Section\n       56043, or the formation of a district, as defined in Section 2215 of the Revenue and\n       Taxation Code, the commission shall determine the amount of property tax revenue\n       to be exchanged by the affected local agency pursuant to this section.\n\n               \"(b) The commission shall notify the county auditor of the proposal and the\n       services which the new jurisdiction proposes to assume within the area, and identify\n       for the auditor the existing service providers within the area subject to the proposal.\n\n               \"(c) If the proposal would not transfer all of an affected agency's service\n       responsibilities to the proposed city or district, the commission and the county\n       auditor shall do all of the following:\n\n               \"(1) The county auditor shall determine the proportion that the amount of\n       property tax revenue derived by each affected local agency pursuant to subdivision\n       (b) of Section 93 of the Revenue and Taxation Code bears to the total amount of\n       revenue from all sources, available for general purposes, received by each affected\n       local agency in the prior fiscal year. For purposes of making this determination and\n       the determination required by paragraph (3), 'total amount of revenue from all\n\n\n   1\n    For a particular area, such services as police and fire protection, water, sewage disposal, road\nmaintenance, street lighting, trash collection, and mosquito abatement, as well as the operation\nof such facilities as a bus system, parks, flood control projects, cemeteries, airports, libraries, and\nswimming pools may be divided among a county, city, and several special districts. (See, e.g.,\nGov. Code, § 61600; Health & Saf. Code, § 4113; Pub. Resources Code, § 5782.2; Wat. Code, §\n35401.)\n   2\n    All references hereafter to the Government Code are by section number only.\n\n                                                  2.                                              88-603\n\n\f          sources available for general purposes' means the total amount of revenue which an\n          affected local agency may use on a discretionary basis for any purpose and does not\n          include any of the following:\n\n                 \"(A) Revenue which, by statute, is required to be used for a specific purpose.\n\n                  \"(B) Revenue from fees, charges, or assessments which are levied to\n          specifically offset the cost of particular services and do not exceed the cost\n          reasonably borne in providing these services.\n\n                 \"(C) Revenue received from the federal government which is required to be\n          used for a specific purpose.\n\n                  \"(2) The commission shall determine, based on information submitted by\n          each affected local agency, an amount equal to the total net cost to each affected\n          local agency during the prior fiscal year of providing those services which the new\n          jurisdiction will assume within the area subject to the proposal. For purposes of this\n          paragraph, 'total net cost' means the total cost which was funded by general purpose\n          revenues of the affected local agency and excludes any portion of the total cost\n          which was funded by any revenues of that agency which are specified in\n          subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1).\n\n                  \"(3) The commission shall multiply the amount determined pursuant to\n          paragraph (2) for each affected local agency by the corresponding proportion\n          determined pursuant to paragraph (1) to derive the amount of property tax revenue\n          used to provide services by each affected local agency during the prior fiscal year\n          within the area subject to the proposal.\n\n                 \". . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n                  \"(e) The executive officer shall notify the auditor of the amount determined\n          pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (c) . . . at the time the executive officer\n          records a certificate of completion pursuant to Section 57203 for any proposal\n          described in subdivision (a), and the auditor shall transfer that amount to the new\n          jurisdiction.\" (Emphases added.)3\n\n\n\n   3\n       The \"commission\" is the local agency formation commission established for the county.\n\n      Revenue and Taxation Code section 93, subdivision (b) states: \"A county shall levy an ad\nvalorem property tax on taxable assessed property,\" with the revenue \"distributed . . . . to local\nagencies, school districts, county superintendents of schools, and community college districts in\naccordance with the provisions of the Government Code.\"\n\n                                                    3.                                             88-603\n\n\fThe question is: are the calculations of section 56842 to include (1) funds carried over to the prior\nfiscal year from a previous year or (2) funds derived from charges for licenses, permits, and such\nservices as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other governmental agencies? We\nconclude that they are not.\n\n                In analyzing section 56842, we first note that cities, counties, and special districts are\nable to obtain funds from a variety of sources other than property taxes. Indeed, because article XIII\nA of the Constitution places a limitation upon the collection of property taxes, the Legislature has\nencouraged local governments to seek alternative methods of financing their community services.\n(See § 16270; Marin Hospital Dist. v.

Besides receiving grants from the federal government and the\nstate, local agencies may generate revenues from such sources as regulatory fees, user charges,\nspecial assessments, and special taxes.

When this formula language was\nincorporated into the provisions of section 56842 in 1986 (Stats. 1986, ch. 956, § 1), the report of\nthe Senate Local Government Committee explained its operation and effect as follows:\n\n                \"When a new city or special district takes over all the service responsibilities\n        of an existing local agency, Assembly Bill 672 requires the local agency formation\n        commission (LAFCO) to request the county auditor to determine the property tax\n        revenues generated by the existing agency. AB 672 then requires the county auditor\n        to transfer that amount to the new city or district.\n\n                \"When a new city or special district takes over some but not all of an existing\n        local agency's services, AB 672 requires the county auditor to determine the\n        relationship between the existing agency's property tax revenues and its total general\n        purpose revenues. LAFCO then determines the total net cost of each service which\n        the new city or district will assume. Then LAFCO multiplies the net cost by the\n        property tax ratio to determine how much property tax revenue will go to the new\n        city or district. The bill requires the county auditor to transfer that amount to the\n        new city or district.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4.                                              88-603\n\n\f       The section 56842 formula may be described in the following terms:\n\n               (1)                             (2)                             (3)\n\n          tax receipts                       cost of                       taxes to be\n        general revenue           x         services          =            transferred\n           receipts                        transferred\n\nIf, for example, general revenues were received by a special district in the amount of $1,000,000\nduring the prior fiscal year, of which $600,000 constituted property tax receipts, and its net cost of\nservices to be assumed by the new city was $100,000 for the prior fiscal year, $60,000 in property\ntax revenues would be transferred from the special district to the new city. The calculations would\nbe:\n\n          $600,000                x         $100,000          =             $60,000\n         $1,000,000\n\nIf the total general revenue receipts had been larger, such as $1,200,000, the property tax revenue\nproportion would be reduced and accordingly a lesser amount in taxes would be transferred. The\ncalculations would be:\n\n          $600,000                x         $100,000          =             $50,000\n         $1,200,000\n\n               It is apparent that the new city will not require as much in property taxes if general\nrevenues are readily available from other sources. The affected transferring agency, on the other\nhand, will no longer need those property taxes previously used to fund the transferred services.\n\n                Of particular significance is the fact that excluded from the calculations of section\n56842 are funds required under state or federal law to be used for a specific purpose and funds\nreceived to offset certain costs of various services. These revenues will continue to be received by\nthe transferring agency or begin to be received by the new city to the extent each furnishes the\nspecified services. Neither is thus pertinent to a determination of what property tax revenues should\nbe transferred between the two entities.\n\n               A. Carry-Over Funds\n\n                The first part of the question concerns funds that have been carried over to the prior\nfiscal year from a previous fiscal year. Do these funds constitute \"revenue . . . received . . . in the\nprior fiscal year\"?\n\n                A common definition of \"revenue\" is \"the annual or periodical yield of taxes, excises,\ncustoms, duties, and other sources of income that a nation, state, or municipality collects and\nreceives into the treasury for public use.\" (Webster's New Internat. Dict. (3d ed. 1971) p. 1942.)\n\n                                                  5.                                           88-603\n\n\fIt is a source or sources of payment, consideration, or income. (See §§ 23800, 26400.) To \"receive\"\nis \"to take possession or delivery of . . . to take in . . . acquire.\" (Webster's, supra, p. 1894.) On the\nother hand, to \"carry over\" funds is \"to hold over . . . for another season\" or to carry forward that\nwhich has already been received. (Id. at p. 344.)\n\n                Under these definitions of the terms used by the Legislature, the carry-over funds\nhere do not constitute revenue received in the prior fiscal year. It was in the year previous to the\nprior fiscal year that they were received and delivered into the treasury for a public purpose. We\nfind no basis for counting them twice as a source of payment; they were merely being retained for\nan additional time period, waiting to be appropriated. We are directed to interpret the words of a\nstatute by \"giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.\" (Committee of Seven Thousand v.\nSuperior Court (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501; Schmidt v.

(See §§ 29085, 29086,\n29092, 29124, 29125, 29126.1, 29130.) \"[E]very statute should be construed with reference to the\nwhole system of law of which it is a part, so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\" (Moore\nv.

The city would\nnot have accumulated carry-over funds to finance the services. Instead it must look to new sources\nof revenue. The statutory formula contemplates that the city will have the same general authority\nto generate funds as the transferring agency. Carry-over funds do not meet the test of ready\navailability.\n\n                It should be noted that the formula contained in section 56842 restricts consideration\nof the tax receipts as well as the general revenue receipts to those of the prior fiscal year. This\nprovides consistency and bases the calculations on the most recent experience in financing the\nservices in question. To include carry-over funds in the general revenue receipts category would\nopen up the fraction denominator of the formula while the numerator remained restricted.\nUniformity would be lost, and more remote and additional periods would be considered that failed\nto reflect the current ability of either the transferring agency or the city to generate funds.\n\n                 Finally, our conclusion effectuates the purpose of section 56842 as expressed in\nsubdivision (c)(3): \"to derive the amount of property tax revenue used to provide services . . . during\nthe prior fiscal year within the area.\" The Legislature has used a collective approach in determining\nthe amount of tax receipts and general revenue receipts used to fund the particular services. Such\nformula eliminates extraordinary situations and instead focuses on the general manner in which the\ntransferring agency did (and the new city presumably will be able to) generate funds to finance the\nservices. Again, carry-over funds have no place in such calculations. We follow the primary rule\nof statutory construction \"to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\" (People v. Woodhead\n\n                                                   6.                                             88-603\n\n\f(1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1143592\"><a href=\"/opinion/1143592/people-v-woodhead/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007; People v.

Charges For Licenses, Permits, and Services\n\n                The second part of the question concerns charges for licenses, permits, and such\nservices as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other governmental agencies. Are\nthese included in or excluded from the section 56842 calculations? We conclude that they are\nexcluded to the extent they did not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the particular\nservices.\n\n                 These charges were \"received by each affected local agency in the prior fiscal year.\"\nWe believe that they were also \"available for general purposes\" and used \"on a discretionary basis\nfor any purpose.\" The fact that the charges were generated by particular activities does not mean\nthat they were required to be segregated by the affected agency and used only to fund the same kinds\nof activities that generated them. Here neither the state nor the federal government has required by\nstatute that the charges were to be used for a specific purpose. The sources of the charges did not\nlimit the local agency's ability to spend the moneys received as it chose.\n\n                 While these charges would thus meet the general test for inclusion in the section\n56842 calculations, the Legislature has also specified certain exclusions.4 The exclusion applicable\nhere is for \"fees, charges, or assessments which are levied to specifically offset the cost of particular\nservices and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing these services.\" (§ 56842, subd.\n(c)(1)(B).)\n\n                 The term \"levied\" has different meanings depending upon its context.

(See People ex\nrel. Happell v.

In keeping with these constitutional limitations, the Legislature has\nspecifically authorized local governments to levy charges in various situations if the charges are\nlimited to covering the costs incurred. (See, e.g., § 54985 [\"in the amount reasonably necessary to\nrecover the cost of providing any product or service or the cost of enforcing any regulation for which\nthe fee or charge is levied\"].)\n\n                 Since a local government may also exercise a revenue raising power without regard\nto the specific service costs involved (see The Pines v.

While the contract could conceivably produce \"excess revenue\" over\nthe costs of the services provided, we note that certain statutory restrictions may be applicable to\nprevent such a consequence. Section 51350, for example, states in part:\n\n               \"A county which provides services through its appropriate departments,\n       boards, commissions, officers or employees, to any city pursuant to contract or as\n       authorized by law, shall charge the city all those costs which are incurred in\n       providing the services so contracted or authorized. A county shall not charge a city\n       contracting for a particular service, either as a direct or an indirect overhead charge,\n       any portion of those costs which are attributable to services made available to all\n       portions of the county, as determined by resolution of the board of supervisors, or\n       which are general overhead costs of operation of the county government. General\n       overhead costs, for the purpose of this section, are those costs which a county would\n       incur regardless of whether or not it provided a service under contract to a city.\"\n\n The same considerations in determining the costs incurred would thus be applicable for contract\nservices as for license and permit programs.\n\n                Our conclusion that license, permit, and contract service charges are excludable from\nthe section 56842 calculations helps facilitate an equitable transfer of property tax revenues. An\naffected agency that is able to offset its costs of issuing licenses and permits and furnishing contract\nservices does not need property tax revenues to fund such activities. By following the same\npractices, the new city would not need property tax revenues for performing these activities. Hence,\nneither local government would have claim to include these funds in the section 56842 calculations.\nTo the extent that the charges exceed the reasonable costs of the governmental activities that\nproduce them, they would properly be included in \"the total amount of revenue from all sources,\navailable for general purposes.\" Such circumstances would mean that a lesser amount of property\ntaxes would be transferred to the new city--the affected agency would retain a greater share of the\nproperty taxes (having lost a possible source of generating excess revenues) and the city would\nobtain a lesser share of them (having gained a possible source of generating excess revenues).\n\n                 In answer to the second part of the question, therefore, we conclude that in\ncalculating the allocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but does not assume all\nservice responsibilities for its territory, the calculations do not include funds derived from charges\nfor licenses, permits, and such services as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other\ngovernmental agencies where the charges are levied to specifically offset the cost of the particular\nservices and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the services.\n\n                                                  9.                                              88-603\n\n\f* * * * *\n\n\n\n\n\n   10.       88-603\n\n\f</pre>",

CONCLUSIONS: In calculating the allocation of property tax revenues when a city incorporates but does not assume all service responsibilities for its territory, are the calculations are not to include (1) funds carried over to the prior fiscal year from a previous year or (2) funds derived from charges for licenses, permits, and such services as law enforcement services furnished under contract to other governmental agencies where the charges are levied specifically to offset the cost of the particular services and do not exceed the cost reasonably borne in providing the services.
