INTRODUCTION\n\n        While serving a 32-month sentence for commercial burglary (Pen. Code, § 459),1\n\ndefendant and appellant, Lamonte Alvin Jefferson, petitioned the trial court to recall his\n\nsentence and resentence him as if he had been convicted of misdemeanor shoplifting\n\n(§§ 459.5, 1170.18, subd. (a)). Defendant stole an ink cartridge worth $24.99 from a\n\nRiverside Kmart store.\n\n        The parties agreed that defendant’s commercial burglary conviction qualified as a\n\nmisdemeanor shoplifting conviction. (§ 459.5 [defining shoplifting as including entering\n\na commercial establishment during regular business hours with intent to commit or\n\ncommitting larceny where value of property taken or intended to be taken does not\n\nexceed $950].) The parties also agreed that, had defendant’s petition been granted at the\n\nJanuary 12, 2015, hearing on the petition, defendant would have been eligible for\n\nimmediate release from prison. However, the court denied the petition on the ground\n\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.18, subds. (b),\n\n(c).)\n\n        Defendant claims the court erroneously applied the preponderance of the evidence\n\nstandard to its unreasonable risk of dangerousness determination. He argues the\n\nprosecution was required to prove his dangerousness to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nor, at the very least, based on clear and convincing evidence. He also claims the court\n\n\n\n\n        1   Unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                               2\n\fabused its discretion in finding he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\n\nunder any standard of proof. We find no error or abuse of discretion, and affirm.\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND\n\n       On September 16, 2014, defendant pled guilty to commercial burglary (§ 459), a\n\nfelony, and admitted a strike prior. In entering his plea, defendant admitted in court that\n\nhe entered a Kmart store in the City of Riverside “with the idea of taking some of their\n\nproperty.” The guilty plea form that defendant signed does not indicate the\n\ncircumstances of the crime, but the People represent that the commercial burglary was\n\ncommitted on September 3, 2014, when defendant, while on active parole, left a Kmart\n\nstore without paying for an ink cartridge worth $24.99.2 On September 16, 2014,\n\ndefendant was sentenced to 16 months in prison on the burglary conviction, doubled to\n\n32 months based on the strike prior.\n\n       On November 14, 2014, defendant petitioned the court to recall his 32-month\n\nsentence and resentence him to not more than six months in county jail, or time served.\n\n(§§ 19, 459.5, 1170.18, subd. (a).) The People opposed the petition and requested a\n\nhearing to determine whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. At a June 12, 2015, hearing, the court found that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n\n\n\n\n       2 In exchange for defendant’s guilty plea to commercial burglary, the People\ndismissed two misdemeanor charges, one for theft (Pen. Code, § 490.5) and another for\npossessing a glass methamphetamine pipe (Health & Saf. Code, § 11364.1).\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                    III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Proposition 47, Overview of Relevant Provisions\n\n       In the November 4, 2014, election, the voters enacted Proposition 47, “The Safe\n\nNeighborhoods and Schools Act” (Proposition 47 or the Act), and the Act went into\n\neffect on November 5, 2014. (People v. Rivera (2015) 233 Cal.App.4th 1085, 1089.) As\n\npertinent, the Act added sections 459.5 and 1170.18 to the Penal Code. (People v.\n\nRivera, supra, at p. 1091.) Section 459.5 defines “shoplifting” as “entering a commercial\n\nestablishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during\n\nregular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be\n\ntaken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).” (§ 459.5, subd. (a).)\n\nShoplifting must be punished as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has one or more\n\ndisqualifying prior convictions. (Ibid.)3 Generally, misdemeanors are punishable by\n\nimprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months. (§ 19.)\n\n       Under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a person who is currently serving a\n\nsentence for a felony conviction that would have been a misdemeanor under the Act may\n\npetition the court that entered the judgment of conviction to recall the person’s felony\n\nsentence and resentence the person as if he or she had been convicted of the\n\nmisdemeanor. If the court determines that the defendant satisfies the criteria of section\n\n\n       3 For purposes of section 459.5, a prior conviction is a conviction for an offense\nspecified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), or an offense requiring registration as a\nsex offender under section 290, subdivision (c). Persons with one or more such prior\nconvictions may be punished pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h).\n\n\n                                             4\n\f1170.18, subdivision (a), the court is required to recall the felony sentence and resentence\n\nthe defendant to the misdemeanor sentence, “unless the court, in its discretion,\n\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\nB. Defendant Was Not Entitled to a Jury Trial on the Dangerousness Finding, and the\n\nProper Standard of Proof Was Preponderance of the Evidence\n\n       Defendant first claims he had a right to a jury trial on the dangerousness finding,\n\nand that the prosecutor had the burden of proving his dangerousness beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt or, at the very least, by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree.\n\n       Other courts have rejected this claim in the context of Proposition 36, the Three\n\nStrikes Reform Act of 2012 (Proposition 36) and its resentencing provision, section\n\n1170.126. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1302-1305\n\n(Kaulick); People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-1076.) Like section\n\n1170.18, which requires the court not to recall a defendant’s felony sentence and\n\nresentence the defendant under Proposition 47 if the court finds the defendant would pose\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety (§ 1170.18, subds. (b), (c)), section\n\n1170.126 includes a similar dangerousness provision (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)). The\n\nreasoning of Kaulick and Flores applies with equal force to dangerousness\n\ndeterminations under Proposition 47, regardless of whether “‘unreasonable risk of danger\n\nto public safety’” has the same meaning in sections 1170.18 (Proposition 47) and\n\n1170.126 (Proposition 36). (See § 1170.18, subd. (c) [defining “‘unreasonable risk of\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdanger to public safety’” “[a]s used throughout this Code”]; People v. Cordova (June 24,\n\n2016, H041050) ___ Cal.App.4th ___ [2016 Cal.App. Lexis 509 [definition of\n\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” in § 1170.18, subd. (c) applies to\n\ndangerousness determinations under both Propositions 47 and 36].)\n\n       Defendant’s argument begins with the settled principal that, “‘“under the Sixth\n\nAmendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence must be\n\nfound by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.”’” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1302, quoting\n\nCunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270, 281; People v. Towne (2008) 44 Cal.4th\n\n63, 74.) A finding of dangerousness under Proposition 36 or 47 is not a fact that exposes\n\nthe defendant to a greater potential sentence, however. If the court finds the defendant\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if he is resentenced under\n\nProposition 36 or 47, the defendant “simply finishes out the term to which he or she was\n\noriginally sentenced.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303 [Proposition 36].)\n\n       Additionally, because Propositions 36 and 47 only allow the defendant’s original\n\nsentence to be modified downward, not upward, any facts found in a proceeding under\n\nsection 1170.18 or 1170.126, including the defendant’s dangerousness, do not implicate\n\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1303-\n\n1305.) Thus, the principle established by the Apprendi line of cases, that “any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\nsubjected to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt” (Apprendi v. New Jersey\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f(2000) 530 U.S. 466, 490) is inapplicable to dangerousness determinations under\n\nPropositions 36 and 47 (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1303-1305).\n\n       Further, a defendant has no constitutional right to be resentenced under\n\nProposition 36 or 47. Rather, the resentencing provisions of Propositions 36 and 47 are\n\nacts of lenity on the part of the electorate. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304\n\n[Proposition 36].) They do not call for the “wholesale resentencing of eligible\n\npetitioners.” (Ibid.) Thus, there is no Sixth Amendment or other constitutional right to\n\nhave the prosecution prove dangerousness to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. (Id. at\n\npp. 1304-1305; see People v. Rivas-Colon (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 444, 451-452\n\n[following the reasoning of Kaulick and holding that a Proposition 47 defendant has no\n\nright to a jury trial on the value of the property stolen, a question essential to the\n\ndefendant’s eligibility for resentencing under Proposition 47].)\n\n       Lastly, the proper standard of proof on a dangerousness finding is the default\n\nstandard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 1305; People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.) Evidence Code section\n\n115 provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires\n\nproof by a preponderance of the evidence.” No statute or case law provides for a higher\n\nstandard of proof, including proof by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n       Defendant maintains that a defendant whose felony offense satisfies the eligibility\n\nrequirements of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) is entitled to have his or her felony\n\nsentence recalled; the misdemeanor sentence is the presumptive sentence; and the court is\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fauthorized to resentence the defendant to the original felony sentence only upon proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of the additional factor of dangerousness. Nothing in the\n\nlanguage of section 1170.18 or in the other Penal Code provisions added or amended by\n\nProposition 47 supports this interpretation. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1303 [rejecting similar argument in Proposition 36 context].)\n\nC. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding Defendant Posed an\n\nUnreasonable Risk of Danger to Public Safety\n\n      Defendant claims that, under any standard of proof, the court abused its discretion\n\nin finding he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Again, we disagree.\n\n      1. Relevant Legal Principles and Standard of Review\n\n      For purposes of Proposition 47, an “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”\n\nmeans “an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony”\n\ndescribed in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).) These violent\n\nfelonies are known as “super strikes” and include murder, attempted murder, solicitation\n\nto commit murder, assault with a machine gun on a police officer, possession of a\n\nweapon of mass destruction, and any serious or violent felony punishable by death or life\n\nimprisonment. (Couzens & Bigelow, Proposition 47: “The Safe Neighborhoods and\n\nSchools Act” (Feb. 2016) pp. 77, 124-125, Appendix V [complete listing of super strikes\n\ndescribed in § 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv) <http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Prop-47-\n\nInformation.pdf>[as of July 7, 2016].)\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       In determining whether there is an unreasonable risk that the defendant will\n\ncommit a super strike, the court may consider: “(1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction\n\nhistory, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length\n\nof prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes. [¶] (2) The petitioner’s\n\ndisciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated. [¶] (3) Any other\n\nevidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a\n\nnew sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (b)(1)-(3).)\n\n       We review a dangerousness finding for an abuse of discretion, given that the court\n\nis statutorily required to determine dangerousness “in its discretion.” (§ 1170.18, subd.\n\n(b).) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\n\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\n\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\n\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’” (People v. Rodrigues (1994)\n\n8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125.) The abuse of discretion standard “involves abundant\n\ndeference” to the court’s ruling. (People v. Jackson (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1009, 1018.)\n\n       2. Relevant Background\n\n       Before the June 12, 2015, hearing on defendant’s dangerousness, the parties\n\nsubmitted briefs on whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. Evidence concerning defendant’s dangerousness, or lack of dangerousness, was\n\nincluded in the briefs, and both sides presented additional argument at the hearing. The\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fpertinent evidence and argument presented on the question of defendant’s dangerousness\n\nare set forth here.\n\n               (a) The People’s Evidence\n\n                      (i) The 1997 Home Invasion Robbery\n\n       When he was 20 years old in 1997, defendant was a principal in an armed, home\n\ninvasion robbery. As a result, he was convicted of residential robbery, assault with a\n\nfirearm, battery with serious bodily injury, and unlawful taking of a vehicle. (Pen. Code,\n\n§§ 211, 245, subd. (a)(2), 243, subd. (d); Veh. Code, § 10851, subd. (a).) The jury found\n\nhe personally used a firearm in each count, and personally inflicted great bodily injury in\n\nthe robbery and assault counts. (Pen. Code, §§ 12022.5, 12022.7.)\n\n       The 1997 crimes occurred in San Diego and their circumstances are briefly\n\ndescribed in People v. Jefferson (Sept. 30, 1998, D029498) [nonpub. opn.]: “Jefferson\n\nand three other masked men entered an apartment where the victim, Laura Mootry, was\n\nstaying. The apartment belonged to her boyfriend. The men were looking for money and\n\nexpensive tire rims which belonged to the boyfriend. Eventually the men left, taking a\n\nVCR, a gold chain and the tire rims. [¶] During the robbery Mootry was repeatedly\n\nstruck on the head by the robbers. They also drug her around the apartment by her hair.\n\nMootry was rendered unconscious at one point and ultimately required 13 stiches to close\n\nher wounds. [¶] As the robbers were leaving the apartment, they took Mootry’s car keys.\n\nThey then took her car, which was not recovered until approximately six weeks later.”\n\n(Id. [at pp. 2-3].)\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                     (ii) Defendant’s Prison Record and Parole Violations\n\n       For the 1997 crimes, defendant was sentenced to 16 years 8 months in prison and\n\nwas released on parole in July 2011. While in prison, he was placed in administrative\n\nsegregation five times, in 1998, 2000, July 2001, October 2001, and 2006. In the 1998,\n\n2000, and July 2001 incidents, he was involved in melees between Crips and Bloods and\n\nignored repeated commands to “get down” or stop fighting. In the 1998 and July 2001\n\nincidents, he was pepper sprayed. In 2004, he wrote a kite indicating his loyalty to the\n\nBlood gang. The kite stated he “keeps it Gangsta 24-7,” told a “Soulja” Blood “to Death\n\nDo Us Part,” and was signed, “Bulletproof Love, Black Money, South Side Soulja 4 Life,\n\nDeath View Side, 59 Brim.” In October 2001, defendant threatened a correctional officer\n\nthat he would “kick [the officer’s] mother fucking ass” if the officer searched his cell, and\n\nin 2006, defendant gassed a correctional officer with pruno.\n\n       Defendant violated parole 10 times following his July 2011 release on parole. He\n\nwas “at large” for 226 days, between May 11, 2012 and April 14, 2014. Twice in April\n\n2014, he violated section 148.9, indicating he was lying about his identity in order to\n\navoid being returned to prison on parole violations. Defendant was still on parole when\n\nhe committed the commercial burglary of the Kmart store on September 3, 2014, and was\n\nsentenced to 32 months in prison.\n\n              (b) Defendant’s Evidence\n\n       Defendant’s prison records showed the “RVR” or “Rules Violation Report” for the\n\n1998 incident was dismissed; a correctional sergeant determined he was not a participant\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fin the 2000 incident, and, in the July 2001 incident, he was not alleged to be one of the\n\ninmates engaging in combat. Regarding the 2006 pruno gassing incident, he was “found\n\nguilty of a lesser, but included offense” of possessing manufactured alcohol. He\n\nemphasized his other RVR’s were many years old, and he had “no RVR’s” for fighting\n\nwith other inmates and no physical altercations with prison staff. He was eligible for and\n\nparticipated in employment while in prison.\n\n       When released on parole in July 2001, defendant had an “assessment score” of 19,\n\nthe lowest possible score for his commitment offense, qualifying him to be housed at a\n\n“Level 2” facility or yard. When he was sentenced to prison in 1998, his assessment\n\nscore was 69. Defense counsel argued that defendant’s low assessment score “speaks for\n\nitself in his level of dangerousness” and his conduct in prison. Counsel also pointed out\n\nthat defendant was part of a group of 72 men who were pepper sprayed for a gang-\n\nfighting incident, and none of defendant’s parole violations involved violence or injury to\n\nanyone.\n\n       Defense counsel also emphasized that defendant was sentenced to the low term of\n\n16 months, doubled to 32 months, on his current conviction, because “[c]learly there was\n\nsomething in mitigation that the [district attorney] that pled it out in that case felt that it\n\nwas not worthy of upper term times two, because he did not get six years.”\n\n       In 2009, defendant married Janice Higgins, who ran a program called “Project\n\nR.A.G.E.—Release Anger and Guilt for Empowerment.” He was actively involved in the\n\nR.A.G.E. program, and Ms. Higgins was committed to ensuring that he led “a clean,\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fsober and productive” life. Defendant had a job waiting for him upon his release from\n\nprison on his current 32-month sentence.\n\n              (c) The Court’s Ruling\n\n       In denying defendant’s petition on dangerousness grounds, the court noted that\n\ndefendant’s “most serious” crime was the 1997 robbery, and “as robberies go” it was\n\n“one of the worst ones.” The court reasoned that defendant’s 1997 robbery and related\n\nconvictions, in combination with his rule violations in prison, his “string of parole\n\nviolations,” and his current felony conviction, showed he was likely to commit a super\n\nstrike.4 (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv), 1170.18, subd. (b)(1), (2).)\n\n       3. Analysis\n\n       The court did not exceed the bounds of reason in determining that defendant was\n\nlikely to commit a super strike if resentenced under Proposition 47. The court reasonably\n\ndetermined that defendant’s 1997 robbery, assault, and battery convictions, in\n\ncombination with his multiple rule violations in prison and his multiple parole violations\n\nfollowing his July 2011 release from prison, showed he was likely to commit a super\n\nstrike. Indeed, defendant personally used a firearm in the 1997 robbery, and personally\n\ninflicted great bodily injury on Mootry, the victim of the 1997 robbery. In sum, the\n\nevidence amply supports the court’s determination that defendant posed an unreasonable\n\n       4 The People also presented evidence that defendant was indicted in 1995 on\ncharges that were later dismissed, and was arrested in 2014 but not charged with a crime.\nAt the June 12, 2015, hearing, the court made it clear that it was not considering the\nevidence of defendant’s 1995 indictment or his 2014 arrest in denying defendant’s\nresentencing petition on dangerousness grounds.\n\n\n                                             13\n\frisk of danger to public safety, that is, that he was likely to commit a super strike,\n\nnamely, murder, attempted murder, or solicitation to commit murder, if resentenced on\n\nhis 2014 commercial burglary conviction under Proposition 47.\n\n                                    IV.

INTRODUCTION\n\n        While serving a 32-month sentence for commercial burglary (Pen. Code, § 459),1\n\ndefendant and appellant, Lamonte Alvin Jefferson, petitioned the trial court to recall his\n\nsentence and resentence him as if he had been convicted of misdemeanor shoplifting\n\n(§§ 459.5, 1170.18, subd. (a)). Defendant stole an ink cartridge worth $24.99 from a\n\nRiverside Kmart store.\n\n        The parties agreed that defendant’s commercial burglary conviction qualified as a\n\nmisdemeanor shoplifting conviction. (§ 459.5 [defining shoplifting as including entering\n\na commercial establishment during regular business hours with intent to commit or\n\ncommitting larceny where value of property taken or intended to be taken does not\n\nexceed $950].) The parties also agreed that, had defendant’s petition been granted at the\n\nJanuary 12, 2015, hearing on the petition, defendant would have been eligible for\n\nimmediate release from prison. However, the court denied the petition on the ground\n\ndefendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.18, subds. (b),\n\n(c).)\n\n        Defendant claims the court erroneously applied the preponderance of the evidence\n\nstandard to its unreasonable risk of dangerousness determination. He argues the\n\nprosecution was required to prove his dangerousness to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nor, at the very least, based on clear and convincing evidence. He also claims the court\n\n\n\n\n        1   Unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.\n\n\n                                               2\n\fabused its discretion in finding he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\n\nunder any standard of proof. We find no error or abuse of discretion, and affirm.\n\n                                   II. BACKGROUND\n\n       On September 16, 2014, defendant pled guilty to commercial burglary (§ 459), a\n\nfelony, and admitted a strike prior. In entering his plea, defendant admitted in court that\n\nhe entered a Kmart store in the City of Riverside “with the idea of taking some of their\n\nproperty.” The guilty plea form that defendant signed does not indicate the\n\ncircumstances of the crime, but the People represent that the commercial burglary was\n\ncommitted on September 3, 2014, when defendant, while on active parole, left a Kmart\n\nstore without paying for an ink cartridge worth $24.99.2 On September 16, 2014,\n\ndefendant was sentenced to 16 months in prison on the burglary conviction, doubled to\n\n32 months based on the strike prior.\n\n       On November 14, 2014, defendant petitioned the court to recall his 32-month\n\nsentence and resentence him to not more than six months in county jail, or time served.\n\n(§§ 19, 459.5, 1170.18, subd. (a).) The People opposed the petition and requested a\n\nhearing to determine whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. At a June 12, 2015, hearing, the court found that defendant posed an\n\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.\n\n\n\n\n       2 In exchange for defendant’s guilty plea to commercial burglary, the People\ndismissed two misdemeanor charges, one for theft (Pen. Code, § 490.5) and another for\npossessing a glass methamphetamine pipe (Health & Saf. Code, § 11364.1).\n\n\n                                             3\n\f                                    III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Proposition 47, Overview of Relevant Provisions\n\n       In the November 4, 2014, election, the voters enacted Proposition 47, “The Safe\n\nNeighborhoods and Schools Act” (Proposition 47 or the Act), and the Act went into\n\neffect on November 5, 2014. (People v. Rivera (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089.) As\n\npertinent, the Act added sections 459.5 and 1170.18 to the Penal Code. (People v.\n\nRivera, supra, at p. 1091.) Section 459.5 defines “shoplifting” as “entering a commercial\n\nestablishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during\n\nregular business hours, where the value of the property that is taken or intended to be\n\ntaken does not exceed nine hundred fifty dollars ($950).” (§ 459.5, subd. (a).)\n\nShoplifting must be punished as a misdemeanor unless the defendant has one or more\n\ndisqualifying prior convictions. (Ibid.)3 Generally, misdemeanors are punishable by\n\nimprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months. (§ 19.)\n\n       Under section 1170.18, subdivision (a), a person who is currently serving a\n\nsentence for a felony conviction that would have been a misdemeanor under the Act may\n\npetition the court that entered the judgment of conviction to recall the person’s felony\n\nsentence and resentence the person as if he or she had been convicted of the\n\nmisdemeanor. If the court determines that the defendant satisfies the criteria of section\n\n\n       3 For purposes of section 459.5, a prior conviction is a conviction for an offense\nspecified in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C), or an offense requiring registration as a\nsex offender under section 290, subdivision (c). Persons with one or more such prior\nconvictions may be punished pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h).\n\n\n                                             4\n\f1170.18, subdivision (a), the court is required to recall the felony sentence and resentence\n\nthe defendant to the misdemeanor sentence, “unless the court, in its discretion,\n\ndetermines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\n\npublic safety.” (§ 1170.18, subd. (b).)\n\nB. Defendant Was Not Entitled to a Jury Trial on the Dangerousness Finding, and the\n\nProper Standard of Proof Was Preponderance of the Evidence\n\n       Defendant first claims he had a right to a jury trial on the dangerousness finding,\n\nand that the prosecutor had the burden of proving his dangerousness beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt or, at the very least, by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree.\n\n       Other courts have rejected this claim in the context of Proposition 36, the Three\n\nStrikes Reform Act of 2012 (Proposition 36) and its resentencing provision, section\n\n1170.126. (People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1302-1305\n\n(Kaulick); People v. Flores (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1075-1076.) Like section\n\n1170.18, which requires the court not to recall a defendant’s felony sentence and\n\nresentence the defendant under Proposition 47 if the court finds the defendant would pose\n\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety (§ 1170.18, subds. (b), (c)), section\n\n1170.126 includes a similar dangerousness provision (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)). The\n\nreasoning of Kaulick and Flores applies with equal force to dangerousness\n\ndeterminations under Proposition 47, regardless of whether “‘unreasonable risk of danger\n\nto public safety’” has the same meaning in sections 1170.18 (Proposition 47) and\n\n1170.126 (Proposition 36). (See § 1170.18, subd. (c) [defining “‘unreasonable risk of\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdanger to public safety’” “[a]s used throughout this Code”]; People v. Cordova (June 24,\n\n2016, H041050) ___ Cal.App.4th ___ [2016 Cal.App. Lexis 509 [definition of\n\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” in § 1170.18, subd. (c) applies to\n\ndangerousness determinations under both Propositions 47 and 36].)\n\n       Defendant’s argument begins with the settled principal that, “‘“under the Sixth\n\nAmendment, any fact that exposes a defendant to a greater potential sentence must be\n\nfound by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.”’” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1302, quoting\n\nCunningham v. California (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281; People v. Towne (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">63</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74.) A finding of dangerousness under Proposition 36 or 47 is not a fact that exposes\n\nthe defendant to a greater potential sentence, however. If the court finds the defendant\n\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if he is resentenced under\n\nProposition 36 or 47, the defendant “simply finishes out the term to which he or she was\n\noriginally sentenced.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303 [Proposition 36].)\n\n       Additionally, because Propositions 36 and 47 only allow the defendant’s original\n\nsentence to be modified downward, not upward, any facts found in a proceeding under\n\nsection 1170.18 or 1170.126, including the defendant’s dangerousness, do not implicate\n\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1303-\n\n1305.) Thus, the principle established by the Apprendi line of cases, that “any fact that\n\nincreases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be\n\nsubjected to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt” (Apprendi v. New Jersey\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\f(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490) is inapplicable to dangerousness determinations under\n\nPropositions 36 and 47 (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1303-1305).\n\n       Further, a defendant has no constitutional right to be resentenced under\n\nProposition 36 or 47. Rather, the resentencing provisions of Propositions 36 and 47 are\n\nacts of lenity on the part of the electorate. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304\n\n[Proposition 36].) They do not call for the “wholesale resentencing of eligible\n\npetitioners.” (Ibid.) Thus, there is no Sixth Amendment or other constitutional right to\n\nhave the prosecution prove dangerousness to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. (Id. at\n\npp. 1304-1305; see People v. Rivas-Colon (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451-452\n\n[following the reasoning of Kaulick and holding that a Proposition 47 defendant has no\n\nright to a jury trial on the value of the property stolen, a question essential to the\n\ndefendant’s eligibility for resentencing under Proposition 47].)\n\n       Lastly, the proper standard of proof on a dangerousness finding is the default\n\nstandard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 1305; People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.) Evidence Code section\n\n115 provides that, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires\n\nproof by a preponderance of the evidence.” No statute or case law provides for a higher\n\nstandard of proof, including proof by clear and convincing evidence.\n\n       Defendant maintains that a defendant whose felony offense satisfies the eligibility\n\nrequirements of section 1170.18, subdivision (a) is entitled to have his or her felony\n\nsentence recalled; the misdemeanor sentence is the presumptive sentence; and the court is\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\fauthorized to resentence the defendant to the original felony sentence only upon proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of the additional factor of dangerousness. Nothing in the\n\nlanguage of section 1170.18 or in the other Penal Code provisions added or amended by\n\nProposition 47 supports this interpretation. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1303 [rejecting similar argument in Proposition 36 context].)\n\nC. The Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Finding Defendant Posed an\n\nUnreasonable Risk of Danger to Public Safety\n\n      Defendant claims that, under any standard of proof, the court abused its discretion\n\nin finding he posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Again, we disagree.\n\n      1. Relevant Legal Principles and Standard of Review\n\n      For purposes of Proposition 47, an “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety”\n\nmeans “an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony”\n\ndescribed in section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv). (§ 1170.18, subd. (c).) These violent\n\nfelonies are known as “super strikes” and include murder, attempted murder, solicitation\n\nto commit murder, assault with a machine gun on a police officer, possession of a\n\nweapon of mass destruction, and any serious or violent felony punishable by death or life\n\nimprisonment. (Couzens & Bigelow, Proposition 47: “The Safe Neighborhoods and\n\nSchools Act” (Feb. 2016) pp. 77, 124-125, Appendix V [complete listing of super strikes\n\ndescribed in § 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv) <http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/Prop-47-\n\nInformation.pdf>[as of July 7, 2016].)\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f       In determining whether there is an unreasonable risk that the defendant will\n\ncommit a super strike, the court may consider: “(1) The petitioner’s criminal conviction\n\nhistory, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length\n\nof prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes. [¶] (2) The petitioner’s\n\ndisciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated. [¶] (3) Any other\n\nevidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a\n\nnew sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n\n(§ 1170.18, subd. (b)(1)-(3).)\n\n       We review a dangerousness finding for an abuse of discretion, given that the court\n\nis statutorily required to determine dangerousness “in its discretion.” (§ 1170.18, subd.\n\n(b).) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\n\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\n\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\n\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’” (People v. Rodrigues (1994)\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1124-1125.) The abuse of discretion standard “involves abundant\n\ndeference” to the court’s ruling. (People v. Jackson (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1018.)\n\n       2. Relevant Background\n\n       Before the June 12, 2015, hearing on defendant’s dangerousness, the parties\n\nsubmitted briefs on whether defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public\n\nsafety. Evidence concerning defendant’s dangerousness, or lack of dangerousness, was\n\nincluded in the briefs, and both sides presented additional argument at the hearing. The\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fpertinent evidence and argument presented on the question of defendant’s dangerousness\n\nare set forth here.\n\n               (a) The People’s Evidence\n\n                      (i) The 1997 Home Invasion Robbery\n\n       When he was 20 years old in 1997, defendant was a principal in an armed, home\n\ninvasion robbery. As a result, he was convicted of residential robbery, assault with a\n\nfirearm, battery with serious bodily injury, and unlawful taking of a vehicle. (Pen. Code,\n\n§§ 211, 245, subd. (a)(2), 243, subd. (d); Veh. Code, § 10851, subd. (a).) The jury found\n\nhe personally used a firearm in each count, and personally inflicted great bodily injury in\n\nthe robbery and assault counts. (Pen. Code, §§ 12022.5, 12022.7.)\n\n       The 1997 crimes occurred in San Diego and their circumstances are briefly\n\ndescribed in People v. Jefferson (Sept. 30, 1998, D029498) [nonpub. opn.]: “Jefferson\n\nand three other masked men entered an apartment where the victim, Laura Mootry, was\n\nstaying. The apartment belonged to her boyfriend. The men were looking for money and\n\nexpensive tire rims which belonged to the boyfriend. Eventually the men left, taking a\n\nVCR, a gold chain and the tire rims. [¶] During the robbery Mootry was repeatedly\n\nstruck on the head by the robbers. They also drug her around the apartment by her hair.\n\nMootry was rendered unconscious at one point and ultimately required 13 stiches to close\n\nher wounds. [¶] As the robbers were leaving the apartment, they took Mootry’s car keys.\n\nThey then took her car, which was not recovered until approximately six weeks later.”\n\n(Id. [at pp. 2-3].)\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f                     (ii) Defendant’s Prison Record and Parole Violations\n\n       For the 1997 crimes, defendant was sentenced to 16 years 8 months in prison and\n\nwas released on parole in July 2011. While in prison, he was placed in administrative\n\nsegregation five times, in 1998, 2000, July 2001, October 2001, and 2006. In the 1998,\n\n2000, and July 2001 incidents, he was involved in melees between Crips and Bloods and\n\nignored repeated commands to “get down” or stop fighting. In the 1998 and July 2001\n\nincidents, he was pepper sprayed. In 2004, he wrote a kite indicating his loyalty to the\n\nBlood gang. The kite stated he “keeps it Gangsta 24-7,” told a “Soulja” Blood “to Death\n\nDo Us Part,” and was signed, “Bulletproof Love, Black Money, South Side Soulja 4 Life,\n\nDeath View Side, 59 Brim.” In October 2001, defendant threatened a correctional officer\n\nthat he would “kick [the officer’s] mother fucking ass” if the officer searched his cell, and\n\nin 2006, defendant gassed a correctional officer with pruno.\n\n       Defendant violated parole 10 times following his July 2011 release on parole. He\n\nwas “at large” for 226 days, between May 11, 2012 and April 14, 2014. Twice in April\n\n2014, he violated section 148.9, indicating he was lying about his identity in order to\n\navoid being returned to prison on parole violations. Defendant was still on parole when\n\nhe committed the commercial burglary of the Kmart store on September 3, 2014, and was\n\nsentenced to 32 months in prison.\n\n              (b) Defendant’s Evidence\n\n       Defendant’s prison records showed the “RVR” or “Rules Violation Report” for the\n\n1998 incident was dismissed; a correctional sergeant determined he was not a participant\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fin the 2000 incident, and, in the July 2001 incident, he was not alleged to be one of the\n\ninmates engaging in combat. Regarding the 2006 pruno gassing incident, he was “found\n\nguilty of a lesser, but included offense” of possessing manufactured alcohol. He\n\nemphasized his other RVR’s were many years old, and he had “no RVR’s” for fighting\n\nwith other inmates and no physical altercations with prison staff. He was eligible for and\n\nparticipated in employment while in prison.\n\n       When released on parole in July 2001, defendant had an “assessment score” of 19,\n\nthe lowest possible score for his commitment offense, qualifying him to be housed at a\n\n“Level 2” facility or yard. When he was sentenced to prison in 1998, his assessment\n\nscore was 69. Defense counsel argued that defendant’s low assessment score “speaks for\n\nitself in his level of dangerousness” and his conduct in prison. Counsel also pointed out\n\nthat defendant was part of a group of 72 men who were pepper sprayed for a gang-\n\nfighting incident, and none of defendant’s parole violations involved violence or injury to\n\nanyone.\n\n       Defense counsel also emphasized that defendant was sentenced to the low term of\n\n16 months, doubled to 32 months, on his current conviction, because “[c]learly there was\n\nsomething in mitigation that the [district attorney] that pled it out in that case felt that it\n\nwas not worthy of upper term times two, because he did not get six years.”\n\n       In 2009, defendant married Janice Higgins, who ran a program called “Project\n\nR.A.G.E.—Release Anger and Guilt for Empowerment.” He was actively involved in the\n\nR.A.G.E. program, and Ms. Higgins was committed to ensuring that he led “a clean,\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\fsober and productive” life. Defendant had a job waiting for him upon his release from\n\nprison on his current 32-month sentence.\n\n              (c) The Court’s Ruling\n\n       In denying defendant’s petition on dangerousness grounds, the court noted that\n\ndefendant’s “most serious” crime was the 1997 robbery, and “as robberies go” it was\n\n“one of the worst ones.” The court reasoned that defendant’s 1997 robbery and related\n\nconvictions, in combination with his rule violations in prison, his “string of parole\n\nviolations,” and his current felony conviction, showed he was likely to commit a super\n\nstrike.4 (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(iv), 1170.18, subd. (b)(1), (2).)\n\n       3. Analysis\n\n       The court did not exceed the bounds of reason in determining that defendant was\n\nlikely to commit a super strike if resentenced under Proposition 47. The court reasonably\n\ndetermined that defendant’s 1997 robbery, assault, and battery convictions, in\n\ncombination with his multiple rule violations in prison and his multiple parole violations\n\nfollowing his July 2011 release from prison, showed he was likely to commit a super\n\nstrike. Indeed, defendant personally used a firearm in the 1997 robbery, and personally\n\ninflicted great bodily injury on Mootry, the victim of the 1997 robbery. In sum, the\n\nevidence amply supports the court’s determination that defendant posed an unreasonable\n\n       4 The People also presented evidence that defendant was indicted in 1995 on\ncharges that were later dismissed, and was arrested in 2014 but not charged with a crime.\nAt the June 12, 2015, hearing, the court made it clear that it was not considering the\nevidence of defendant’s 1995 indictment or his 2014 arrest in denying defendant’s\nresentencing petition on dangerousness grounds.\n\n\n                                             13\n\frisk of danger to public safety, that is, that he was likely to commit a super strike,\n\nnamely, murder, attempted murder, or solicitation to commit murder, if resentenced on\n\nhis 2014 commercial burglary conviction under Proposition 47.\n\n                                    IV. DISPOSITION\n\n       The order denying defendant’s Proposition 47 petition is affirmed.\n\n       CERTIFIED FOR PUBLICATION\n\n\n                                                                 CODRINGTON\n                                                                                         J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\nRAMIREZ\n                        P.
