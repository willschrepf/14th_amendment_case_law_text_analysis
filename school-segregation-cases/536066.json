CITY OF CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, \n\n                      ET AL. \n\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT\n\n      No. 08–1521. Argued March 2, 2010—Decided June 28, 2010\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, this\n Court held that the Second Amendment protects the right to keep\n and bear arms for the purpose of self-defense and struck down a Dis\n trict of Columbia law that banned the possession of handguns in the\n home. Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chi\n cago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by\n almost all private citizens. After Heller, petitioners filed this federal\n suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related ac\n tions, alleging that the City’s handgun ban has left them vulnerable\n to criminals. They sought a declaration that the ban and several re\n lated City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amend\n ments. Rejecting petitioners’ argument that the ordinances are un\n constitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously\n had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had\n explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment\n applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow estab\n lished Circuit precedent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on\n three 19th-century cases—United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542,\n Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S. 535—\n which were decided in the wake of this Court’s interpretation of the\n Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause in the\n Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36.\nHeld: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.\n567 F. 3d 856, reversed and remanded.\n    JUSTICE ALITO delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to\n  Parts I, II–A, II–B, II–D, III–A, and III–B, concluding that the Four\n\f2                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    teenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, rec\n    ognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self\n    defense. Pp. 5–9, 11–19, 19–33.\n       (a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions. Primarily, they\n    argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privi\n    leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\n    the Slaughter-House Cases’ narrow interpretation of the Clause\n    should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, they contend that\n    the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the\n    Second Amendment right. Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respon\n    dents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to\n    the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any “ ‘civi\n    lized’ ” legal system. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country\n    that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that\n    right is not protected by due process. And since there are civilized\n    countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of hand\n    guns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such meas\n    ures. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally\n    applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g.,\n    Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247, but the\n    constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War’s aftermath\n    fundamentally altered the federal system. Four years after the adop\n    tion of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-\n    House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\n    those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal government,\n    its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,” 16 Wall., at 79,\n    and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Fed\n    eral Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76. Under\n    this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause protects only very limited rights. Id., at 79–80. Subse\n    quently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to\n    the Federal Government in Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, Presser, 116\n    U. S. 252, and Miller, 153 U. S. 535, the decisions on which the Sev\n    enth Circuit relied in this case. Pp. 5–9.\n       (c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms\n    applies to the States is considered in light of the Court’s precedents\n    applying the Bill of Rights’ protections to the States. Pp. 11–19.\n          (1) In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due\n    Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights pro\n    tections. See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516. Five fea\n    tures of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted. First,\n    the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from\n    the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ncitizenship. See Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99. Second, the\nCourt explained that the only rights due process protected against\nstate infringement were those “of such a nature that they are in\ncluded in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid. Third, some\ncases during this era “can be seen as having asked . . . if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the particular pro\ntection” asserted therein. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149,\nn. 14. Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights\nguarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection,\nfinding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v.\nNew York, 268 U. S. 652, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283\nU. S. 697, but the grand jury indictment requirement did not, Hur\ntado, supra. Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within\nthe conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded\nagainst state infringement sometimes differed from those provided\nagainst abridgment by the Federal Government. Pp. 11–13.\n     (2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of\nRights’ provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 71–\n72 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that the\nory. Pp. 13–15.\n     (3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by\nJustice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by\nwhich the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights con\ntained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright,\n372 U. S. 335, 341. These decisions abandoned three of the charac\nteristics of the earlier period. The Court clarified that the governing\nstandard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is funda\nmental to our Nation’s particular scheme of ordered liberty and sys\ntem of justice. Duncan, supra, at 149, n. 14. The Court eventually\nheld that almost all of the Bill of Rights’ guarantees met the re\nquirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\nalso held that Bill of Rights protections must “all . . . be enforced\nagainst the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to\nthe same standards that protect those personal rights against federal\nencroachment.” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10. Under this ap\nproach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular\nBill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.\nSee, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S.\n455. Pp. 15–19.\n   (d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States. Pp. 19–33.\n     (1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to\nthe Nation’s scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391\n\f4                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether\n    it is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washing\n    ton v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. Heller points unmistakably to\n    the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal\n    systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held\n    that individual self-defense is “the central component” of the Second\n    Amendment right. 554 U. S., at ___, ___. Explaining that “the need\n    for defense of self, family, and property is most acute” in the home,\n    ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because\n    they are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use\n    for protection of one’s home and family,” id., at ___, ___–___. It thus\n    concluded that citizens must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the\n    core lawful purpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___. Heller also clarifies\n    that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradi\n    tions,” Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Heller explored the right’s origins\n    in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was re\n    garded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of\n    the Bill of Rights. This is powerful evidence that the right was re\n    garded as fundamental in the sense relevant here. That understand\n    ing persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights’\n    ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era,\n    which protected the right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 19–22.\n         (2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates\n    clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Framers and ratifiers\n    counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental\n    rights necessary to the Nation’s system of ordered liberty. Pp. 22–33.\n            (i) By the 1850’s, the fear that the National Government would\n    disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep\n    and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense. Abolitionist au\n    thors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm “Free-\n    Soilers” in “Bloody Kansas,” met with outrage that the constitutional\n    right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people. After\n    the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to\n    disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.\n    These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen’s\n    Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the\n    right to keep and bear arms. Congress, however, ultimately deemed\n    these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth\n    Amendment. Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment\n    was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the\n    rights set out in the Civil Rights Act. See General Building Contrac\n    tors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389. In Congressional\n    debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the\n    39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndamental right deserving of protection. Evidence from the period\nimmediately following the Amendment’s ratification confirms that\nthat right was considered fundamental. Pp. 22–31.\n        (ii) Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that\nMembers of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule. But while §1 does\ncontain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause,\nit can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit dis\ncrimination. If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second\nAmendment should be singled out for special—and specially unfavor\nable—treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion. The right to keep\nand bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a\nprohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in\nan evenhanded manner. Pp. 30–33.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded, in Parts II–C, IV, and V, that the Four\nteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second\nAmendment right recognized in Heller. Pp. 10–11, 33–44.\n   (a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one\nof the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”\nThere is no need to reconsider the Court’s interpretation of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases because,\nfor many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether par\nticular rights are protected against state infringement under the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Pp. 10–11.\n   (b) Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are rejected be\ncause they are at war with Heller’s central holding. In effect, they\nask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a\ndifferent body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights\nguarantees. Pp. 33–40.\n   (c) The dissents’ objections are addressed and rejected. Pp. 41–44.\n   JUSTICE THOMAS agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms that was recog\nnized in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___, fully applicable\nto the States. However, he asserted, there is a path to this conclusion\nthat is more straightforward and more faithful to the Second\nAmendment’s text and history. The Court is correct in describing the\nSecond Amendment right as “fundamental” to the American scheme\nof ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, and\n“deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and traditions,” Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721. But the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nDue Process Clause, which speaks only to “process,” cannot impose\nthe type of substantive restraint on state legislation that the Court\nasserts. Rather, the right to keep and bear arms is enforceable\n\f6                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    against the States because it is a privilege of American citizenship\n    recognized by §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides, inter\n    alia: “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the\n    privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In inter\n    preting this language, it is important to recall that constitutional\n    provisions are “ ‘written to be understood by the voters.’ ” Heller, 554\n    U. S., at ___. The objective of this inquiry is to discern what “ordi\n    nary citizens” at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment’s ratification\n    would have understood that Amendment's Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause to mean. Ibid. A survey of contemporary legal authorities\n    plainly shows that, at that time, the ratifying public understood the\n    Clause to protect constitutionally enumerated rights, including the\n    right to keep and bear arms.

CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\napplicable to the States.\n                                  I\n   Otis McDonald, Adam Orlov, Colleen Lawson, and\nDavid Lawson (Chicago petitioners) are Chicago residents\nwho would like to keep handguns in their homes for self\ndefense but are prohibited from doing so by Chicago’s\nfirearms laws. A City ordinance provides that “[n]o person\nshall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the\nholder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.”\nChicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–040(a) (2009). The\nCode then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus\neffectively banning handgun possession by almost all\nprivate citizens who reside in the City. §8–20–050(c).\nLike Chicago, Oak Park makes it “unlawful for any person\nto possess . . . any firearm,” a term that includes “pistols,\nrevolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as\nhandguns.” Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1\n(2007), 27–1–1 (2009).\n   Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents\n“from the loss of property and injury or death from fire\narms.” See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the\nCity Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti\ntioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun\nban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police\nDepartment statistics, we are told, reveal that the City’s\nhandgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban\nwas enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of\nthe highest murder rates in the country and rates of other\nviolent crimes that exceed the average in comparable\ncities.2\n——————\n  1 See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7 (noting that\n\nhandgun murder rate was 9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008).\n  2 Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n8–9 (“In 2002 and again in 2008, Chicago had more murders than any\nother city in the U.

Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resi\ndent whose home has been targeted by burglars. “In Mrs.\nLawson’s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago\nwould decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or\ndeath should she ever be threatened again in her home.”3\nMcDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own\nhandguns that they store outside of the city limits, but\nthey would like to keep their handguns in their homes for\nprotection.

All three cases were assigned to the same\nDistrict Judge.\n  The District Court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the\nChicago and Oak Park laws are unconstitutional. See\nApp. 83–84; NRA, Inc. v. Oak Park, 617 F. Supp. 2d 752,\n754 (ND Ill. 2008). The court noted that the Seventh\nCircuit had “squarely upheld the constitutionality of a ban\non handguns a quarter century ago,” id., at 753 (citing\nQuilici v. Morton Grove, 695 F. 2d 261 (CA7 1982)), and\nthat Heller had explicitly refrained from “opin[ing] on the\nsubject of incorporation vel non of the Second Amend\nment,” NRA, 617 F. Supp. 2d, at 754. The court observed\nthat a district judge has a “duty to follow established\nprecedent in the Court of Appeals to which he or she is\nbeholden, even though the logic of more recent caselaw\nmay point in a different direction.” Id., at 753.\n  The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on three 19th\ncentury cases—United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542\n(1876), Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252 (1886), and Miller\nv. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894)—that were decided in the\nwake of this Court’s interpretation of the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the\nSlaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873). The Seventh\nCircuit described the rationale of those cases as “defunct”\nand recognized that they did not consider the question\nwhether the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\nincorporates the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms. NRA, Inc. v. Chicago, 567 F. 3d 856, 857, 858\n(2009). Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit observed that it\nwas obligated to follow Supreme Court precedents that\nhave “direct application,” and it declined to predict how\nthe Second Amendment would fare under this Court’s\nmodern “selective incorporation” approach.

As a secon\ndary argument, petitioners contend that the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s Due Process Clause “incorporates” the\nSecond Amendment right.\n  Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respondents) main\ntain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to the\nStates only if that right is an indispensable attribute of\nany “ ‘civilized’ ” legal system. Brief for Municipal Respon\ndents 9. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that\ndoes not recognize the right, the municipal respondents\ntell us, then that right is not protected by due process.\nIbid. And since there are civilized countries that ban or\nstrictly regulate the private possession of handguns, the\nmunicipal respondents maintain that due process does not\npreclude such measures. Id., at 21–23. In light of the\nparties’ far-reaching arguments, we begin by recounting\nthis Court’s analysis over the years of the relationship\nbetween the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the States.\n                             B\n   The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment,\noriginally applied only to the Federal Government. In\nBarron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243\n(1833), the Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall,\nexplained that this question was “of great importance” but\n“not of much difficulty.” Id., at 247. In less than four\npages, the Court firmly rejected the proposition that the\nfirst eight Amendments operate as limitations on the\n\f6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nStates, holding that they apply only to the Federal Gov\nernment. See also Lessee of Livingston v. Moore, 7 Pet.\n469, 551–552 (1833) (“[I]t is now settled that those amend\nments [in the Bill of Rights] do not extend to the states”).\n   The constitutional Amendments adopted in the after\nmath of the Civil War fundamentally altered our country’s\nfederal system. The provision at issue in this case, §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other\nthings, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or\nimmunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive\n“any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc\ness of law.”\n   Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, this Court was asked to interpret the\nAmendment’s reference to “the privileges or immunities of\ncitizens of the United States.” The Slaughter-House\nCases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per\nmitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the\nbutchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.\nJustice Samuel Miller’s opinion for the Court concluded\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\nthose rights “which owe their existence to the Federal\ngovernment, its National character, its Constitution, or its\nlaws.” Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental\nrights—rights that predated the creation of the Federal\nGovernment and that “the State governments were cre\nated to establish and secure”—were not protected by the\nClause. Id., at 76.\n   In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of\nfederal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two\nprincipal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\nClause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing\nwith the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                      7\n\n                           Opinion of the Court\n\nof Article IV, both of which refer to state citizenship.5\n(Emphasis added.) Second, the Court stated that a con\ntrary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory\nof the relations of the State and Federal governments to\neach other and of both these governments to the people,”\nand the Court refused to conclude that such a change had\nbeen made “in the absence of language which expresses\nsuch a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78.\nFinding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States” lacking by this high standard, the\nCourt reasoned that the phrase must mean something\nmore limited.\n  Under the Court’s narrow reading, the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause protects such things as the right\n     “to come to the seat of government to assert any claim\n     [a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans\n     act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro\n     tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering\n     its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State\n     of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein, with the\n     same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at\n     79–80 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Finding no constitutional protection against state intru\nsion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the\nCourt upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus\ntice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices\nSwayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\n——————\n   5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll per\n\nsons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris\ndiction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein\nthey reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause\nof Article IV provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”\n(Emphasis added.)\n\f8                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nClause to “a vain and idle enactment, which accomplished\nnothing, and most unnecessarily excited Congress and the\npeople on its passage.” Id., at 96; see also id., at 104.\nJustice Field opined that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause protects rights that are “in their nature . . . funda\nmental,” including the right of every man to pursue his\nprofession without the imposition of unequal or discrimi\nnatory restrictions. Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis\nsent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica\ntion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the\nmost important privileges and immunities of citizens of\nthe United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at\n118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated\nin the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.\nId., at 119. Justice Swayne described the majority’s nar\nrow reading of the Privileges or Immunities Clause as\n“turn[ing] . . . what was meant for bread into a stone.” Id.,\nat 129 (dissenting opinion).\n   Today, many legal scholars dispute the correctness of\nthe narrow Slaughter-House interpretation. See, e.g.,\nSaenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 522, n. 1, 527 (1999) (THOMAS,\nJ., dissenting) (scholars of the Fourteenth Amendment\nagree “that the Clause does not mean what the Court said\nit meant in 1873”); Amar, Substance and Method in the\nYear 2000, 28 Pepperdine L. Rev. 601, 631, n. 178 (2001)\n(“Virtually no serious modern scholar—left, right, and\ncenter—thinks that this [interpretation] is a plausible\nreading of the Amendment”); Brief for Constitutional Law\nProfessors as Amici Curiae 33 (claiming an “overwhelming\nconsensus among leading constitutional scholars” that the\nopinion is “egregiously wrong”); C. Black, A New Birth of\nFreedom 74–75 (1997).\n   Three years after the decision in the Slaughter-House\nCases, the Court decided Cruikshank, the first of the three\n19th-century cases on which the Seventh Circuit relied.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    9\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\n92 U. S. 542. In that case, the Court reviewed convictions\nstemming from the infamous Colfax Massacre in Louisi\nana on Easter Sunday 1873. Dozens of blacks, many\nunarmed, were slaughtered by a rival band of armed white\nmen.6 Cruikshank himself allegedly marched unarmed\nAfrican-American prisoners through the streets and then\nhad them summarily executed.7 Ninety-seven men were\nindicted for participating in the massacre, but only nine\nwent to trial. Six of the nine were acquitted of all charges;\nthe remaining three were acquitted of murder but con\nvicted under the Enforcement Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 140, for\nbanding and conspiring together to deprive their victims of\nvarious constitutional rights, including the right to bear\narms.8\n    The Court reversed all of the convictions, including\nthose relating to the deprivation of the victims’ right to\nbear arms. Cruikshank, 92 U. S., at 553, 559. The Court\nwrote that the right of bearing arms for a lawful purpose\n“is not a right granted by the Constitution” and is not “in\nany manner dependent upon that instrument for its exis\ntence.” Id., at 553. “The second amendment,” the Court\ncontinued, “declares that it shall not be infringed; but this\n. . . means no more than that it shall not be infringed by\nCongress.” Ibid. “Our later decisions in Presser v. Illinois,\n116 U. S. 252, 265 (1886), and Miller v. Texas, 153 U. S.\n535, 538 (1894), reaffirmed that the Second Amendment\napplies only to the Federal Government.” Heller, 554\nU.

Rev. 2113, 2153 (1993).\n\f10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                              C\n   As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’\nclaims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,\nhowever, that we should overrule those decisions and hold\nthat the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi\nleges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In\npetitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprotects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as\nwell as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,\nbut petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full\nscope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen\nsus on that question among the scholars who agree that\nthe Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See\nSaenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.\nFor many decades, the question of the rights protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement\nhas been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that\nAmendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities\nClause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-\nHouse holding.\n   At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from\nconsidering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right\nbinding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23\n(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in\nthe sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by\nour later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in\nwhich the Court began the process of “selective incorpo\nration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never\npreviously addressed the question whether the right to\nkeep and bear arms applies to the States under that\ntheory.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding\nthat other rights that were at issue in that case are bind\ning on the States through the Due Process Clause. In\nCruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the\npeople peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which\nis protected by the First Amendment, applied only against\nthe Federal Government and not against the States. See\n92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the\nCourt held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun\ndamental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, 299\nU. S. 353, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and\nthus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms\napplies to the States under the Due Process Clause.\n                              D\n                               1\n  In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider\nwhether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from\ninfringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado\nv. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (due process does not\nrequire grand jury indictment); Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v.\nChicago, 166 U. S. 226 (1897) (due process prohibits\nStates from taking of private property for public use with\nout just compensation). Five features of the approach\ntaken during the ensuing era should be noted.\n  First, the Court viewed the due process question as\nentirely separate from the question whether a right was a\nprivilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin\ning v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 99 (1908).\n  Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro\ntected against state infringement by the Due Process\nClause were those rights “of such a nature that they are\nincluded in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.\nSee also, e.g., Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46 (1947);\nBetts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942); Palko v. Connecticut,\n\f12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n302 U. S. 319 (1937); Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297\nU. S. 233 (1936); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 (1932).\nWhile it was “possible that some of the personal rights\nsafeguarded by the first eight Amendments against Na\ntional action [might] also be safeguarded against state\naction,” the Court stated, this was “not because those\nrights are enumerated in the first eight Amendments.”\nTwining, supra, at 99.\n   The Court used different formulations in describing the\nboundaries of due process. For example, in Twining, the\nCourt referred to “immutable principles of justice which\ninhere in the very idea of free government which no mem\nber of the Union may disregard.” 211 U. S., at 102 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu\nsetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights\nthat are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the\nCourt famously said that due process protects those rights\nthat are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”\nand essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.”\n302 U. S., at 325.\n   Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court\n“can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into\nwhether some particular procedural safeguard was re\nquired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined\nthat would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan\nv. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in\nholding that due process prohibits a State from taking\nprivate property without just compensation, the Court\ndescribed the right as “a principle of natural equity, rec\nognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from\na deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. &\nQ. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that\ndue process did not provide a right against compelled\nincrimination in part because this right “has no place in\nthe jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           13\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nthe domain of the common law.” Twining, supra, at 113.\n    Fourth, the Court during this era was not hesitant to\nhold that a right set out in the Bill of Rights failed to\nmeet the test for inclusion within the protection of the\nDue Process Clause. The Court found that some such\nrights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S.\n652, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.\nMinnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931) (same);\nPowell, supra (assistance of counsel in capital cases); De\nJonge, supra (freedom of assembly); Cantwell v. Con\nnecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940) (free exercise of religion).\nBut others did not. See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury\nindictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege\nagainst self-incrimination).\n    Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights\nwas held to fall within the conception of due process, the\nprotection or remedies afforded against state infringement\nsometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro\nvided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To\ngive one example, in Betts the Court held that, although\nthe Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun\nsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant\nwas unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause\nrequired appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed\nings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case\n. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental\nfairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo\nrado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), the Court held that the “core of\nthe Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of\nordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States\nthrough the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary\nrule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the\nStates. Id., at 27–28, 33.\n                          2\n  An alternative theory regarding the relationship be\n\f14                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntween the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held\nthat §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,\nAdamson, supra, at 71–72 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,\nsupra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black\nnoted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four\nteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend\nment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,\nin so doing, overruled this Court’s decision in Barron.9\nAdamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None\n——————\n  9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee\n\non Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated\nthat the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied\nand secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.\nGlobe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text\nof §1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the\npower to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution\ntoday.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089–1090; A. Amar, The Bill of\nRights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill\nof Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained\nthe view that the rights guaranteed by §1 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti\ntution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84\n(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader\nof the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the\nConstitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation\non the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con\ngress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe\n2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth\nAmendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30\nstatements during the debates in Congress interpreting §1 to incorpo\nrate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that “[n]ot a single\nsenator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand\ning” of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n  10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the\n\nsignificance of these statements.

J. 435 (1981).\n  Proponents of the view that §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment makes\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States re\nspond that the terms privileges, immunities, and rights were used\ninterchangeably at the time, see, e.g., Curtis, supra, at 64–65, and that\nthe position taken by the leading congressional proponents of the\nAmendment was widely publicized and understood, see, e.g., Wilden\nthal, supra, at 1564–1565, 1590; Hardy, Original Popular Understand\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866–1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695 (2009). A number of scholars have\nfound support for the total incorporation of the Bill of Rights. See\nCurtis, supra, at 57–130; Aynes, On Misreading John Bingham and the\nFourteenth Amendment, 103 Yale L. J. 57, 61 (1993); see also Amar,\nBill of Rights 181–230.

S. 784, 794\n(1969).\n  The decisions during this time abandoned three of the\npreviously noted characteristics of the earlier period.11\nThe Court made it clear that the governing standard is not\nwhether any “civilized system [can] be imagined that\nwould not accord the particular protection.” Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149, n. 14. Instead, the Court inquired whether a\nparticular Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental to our\nscheme of ordered liberty and system of justice. Id., at\n149, and n. 14; see also id., at 148 (referring to those\n“fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at\nthe base of all our civil and political institutions” (empha\nsis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).\n  The Court also shed any reluctance to hold that rights\nguaranteed by the Bill of Rights met the requirements for\nprotection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\neventually incorporated almost all of the provisions of the\nBill of Rights.12 Only a handful of the Bill of Rights pro\n——————\n  11 By contrast, the Court has never retreated from the proposition\n\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause\npresent different questions. And in recent cases addressing unenumer\nated rights, we have required that a right also be “implicit in the\nconcept of ordered liberty.” See, e.g., Washington v. Glucksberg, 521\nU. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  12 With respect to the First Amendment, see Everson v. Board of Ed.\n\nof Ewing, 330 U.

See Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,\nInc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.

Carey, 677 F. 2d 957, 961 (CA2 1982) (holding as a\nmatter of first impression that the “Third Amendment is incorporated\ninto the Fourteenth Amendment for application to the states”).\n   Our governing decisions regarding the Grand Jury Clause of the\nFifth Amendment and the Seventh Amendment’s civil jury requirement\nlong predate the era of selective incorporation.\n\f18                     MCDONALD v.

S. 38, 48–49 (1985).14\n  Employing this approach, the Court overruled earlier\ndecisions in which it had held that particular Bill of Rights\n——————\n   14 There is one exception to this general rule. The Court has held that\n\nalthough the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury requires a unani\nmous jury verdict in federal criminal trials, it does not require a\nunanimous jury verdict in state criminal trials. See Apodaca v. Oregon,\n406 U. S. 404 (1972); see also Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356\n(1972) (holding that the Due Process Clause does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in state criminal trials). But that ruling was the\nresult of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement\nof the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices\nagreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the\nFederal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395\n(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus\ntices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,\n406 U. S., at 406 (plurality opinion), and four other Justices took the\nview that the Sixth Amendment requires unanimous jury verdicts in\nfederal and state criminal trials, id., at 414–415 (Stewart, J., dissent\ning); Johnson, supra, at 381–382 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Justice\nPowell’s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not\nstate, cases.     Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well\nestablished rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply\nidentically to the States and the Federal Government. See Johnson,\nsupra, at 395–396 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (footnote omitted) (“In any\nevent, the affirmance must not obscure that the majority of the Court\nremains of the view that, as in the case of every specific of the Bill of\nRights that extends to the States, the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial\nguarantee, however it is to be construed, has identical application\nagainst both State and Federal Governments”).\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

In answering that question, as just explained, we\nmust decide whether the right to keep and bear arms is\nfundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan,\n391 U. S., at 149, or as we have said in a related context,\nwhether this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s his\ntory and tradition,” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.

Thus, we concluded, citizens\nmust be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful\npurpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 58).\n   Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition.” Glucksberg, supra, at\n721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored\nthe right’s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of\nRights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self\ndefense, 554 U.

As we noted in Heller, King George III’s attempt\nto disarm the colonists in the 1760’s and 1770’s “provoked\npolemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as\nEnglishmen to keep arms.”16 Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21);\nsee also L.

Fed\neralists responded, not by arguing that the right was\ninsufficiently important to warrant protection but by\ncontending that the right was adequately protected by the\nConstitution’s assignment of only limited powers to the\nFederal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25–\n26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike\nagreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the\nnewly formed system of government. See Levy 143–149;\nJ. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an\nAnglo-American Right 155–164 (1994). But those who\nwere fearful that the new Federal Government would\ninfringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and\nbear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as\na condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327–331 (2d ed.\n1854); 3 id., at 657–661; 4 id., at 242–246, 248–249; see\nalso Levy 26–34; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American\nConstitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th\ned. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right\nwas regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.\n   This understanding persisted in the years immediately\nfollowing the ratification of the Bill of Rights.

Founding-era\nlegal commentators confirmed the importance of the right\nto early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, de\nscribed the right to keep and bear arms as “the true palla\ndium of liberty” and explained that prohibitions on the\nright would place liberty “on the brink of destruction.” 1\nBlackstone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 300 (S.

CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\ngress concluded that legislative action was necessary. Its\nefforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms\ndemonstrate that the right was still recognized to be\nfundamental.\n   The most explicit evidence of Congress’ aim appears in\n§14 of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided\nthat “the right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws\nand proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal\nsecurity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of\nestate, real and personal, including the constitutional\nright to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all\nthe citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previ\nous condition of slavery.” 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis\nadded).22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that “all\nthe citizens,” black and white, would have “the constitu\ntional right to bear arms.”\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was\nconsidered at the same time as the Freedmen’s Bureau\nAct, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to\nkeep and bear arms.23 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act\n——————\ncally interfered with.” Joint Committee on Reconstruction, H. R. Rep.\nNo. 30, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 140 (1866).\n   22 The Freedmen’s Bureau bill was amended to include an express\n\nreference to the right to keep and bear arms, see 39th Cong. Globe 654\n(Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that\nthe unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at\n743 (Sen. Lyman Trumbull).\n   23 There can be do doubt that the principal proponents of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1866 meant to end the disarmament of African Americans\nin the South. In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its\npurpose as securing to blacks the “privileges which are essential to\nfreemen.” Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described\nMississippi law that “prohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having\nfire-arms” and explained that the bill would “destroy” such laws. Ibid.\nSimilarly, Representative Sidney Clarke cited disarmament of freed\nmen in Alabama and Mississippi as a reason to support the Civil Rights\nAct and to continue to deny Alabama and Mississippi representation in\nCongress: “I regret, sir, that justice compels me to say, to the disgrace\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

This language was vir\ntually identical to language in §14 of the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, 14 Stat. 176–177 (“the right . . . to have full\nand equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning\npersonal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition,\nenjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal”).\nAnd as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that\none of the “laws and proceedings concerning personal\nliberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment,\nand disposition of estate, real and personal” was “the\nconstitutional right to bear arms.” Ibid. Representative\nBingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the\nsame rights as enumerated in the Freedmen’s Bureau bill,\nwhich of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and\nbear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable\nconclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, aimed to protect “the constitutional right to\nbear arms” and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 264–265 (noting that one of the\n“core purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the\nFourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances” of\nfreedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to\n“affirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self\ndefense”).\n   Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative\n\n——————\nof the Federal Government, that the ‘reconstructed’ State authorities of\nMississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers and\narm the rebels fresh from the field of treasonable strife.

CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of the Court\n\nremedies insufficient. Southern resistance, Presidential\nvetoes, and this Court’s pre-Civil-War precedent per\nsuaded Congress that a constitutional amendment was\nnecessary to provide full protection for the rights of\nblacks.24 Today, it is generally accepted that the Four\nteenth Amendment was understood to provide a constitu\ntional basis for protecting the rights set out in the Civil\nRights Act of 1866. See General Building Contractors\nAssn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U. S. 375, 389 (1982); see\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 187; Calabresi, Two Cheers for\nProfessor Balkin’s Originalism, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 663,\n669–670 (2009).\n   In debating the Fourteenth Amendment, the 39th Con\ngress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a\nfundamental right deserving of protection. Senator Sam\nuel Pomeroy described three “indispensable” “safeguards\nof liberty under our form of Government.” 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1182. One of these, he said, was the right to keep\nand bear arms:\n       “Every man . . . should have the right to bear arms\n     for the defense of himself and family and his home\n     stead. And if the cabin door of the freedman is broken\n     open and the intruder enters for purposes as vile as\n     were known to slavery, then should a well-loaded\n     musket be in the hand of the occupant to send the pol\n     luted wretch to another world, where his wretched\n     ness will forever remain complete.” Ibid.\nEven those who thought the Fourteenth Amendment\nunnecessary believed that blacks, as citizens, “have equal\n——————\n   24 For example, at least one southern court had held the Civil Rights\n\nAct to be unconstitutional.

James Nye); see also Foner\n258–259.25\n  Evidence from the period immediately following the\nratification of the Fourteenth Amendment only confirms\nthat the right to keep and bear arms was considered fun\ndamental. In an 1868 speech addressing the disarmament\nof freedmen, Representative Stevens emphasized the\nnecessity of the right: “Disarm a community and you rob\nthem of the means of defending life. Take away their\nweapons of defense and you take away the inalienable\nright of defending liberty.” “The fourteenth amendment,\nnow so happily adopted, settles the whole question.”\nCong. Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to\nthe right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued\ndisarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,\nFreedmen 120–131. Finally, legal commentators from the\nperiod emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.\nSee, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the\nUnited States of America §118, p. 145 (1867) (reprint\n1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional\nLaw of the United States §239, pp. 152–153 (3d ed. 1875).\n  The right to keep and bear arms was also widely pro\ntected by state constitutions at the time when the Four\nteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\n——————\n    25 Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the\n\nright to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures. In speaking\ngenerally on reconstruction, Representative Roswell Hart listed the\n“ ‘right of the people to keep and bear arms’ ” as among those rights\nnecessary to a “republican form of government.” 39th Cong. Globe\n1629. Similarly, in objecting to a bill designed to disarm southern\nmilitias, Senator Willard Saulsbury argued that such a measure would\nviolate the Second Amendment. Id., at 914–915. Indeed, the bill\n“ultimately passed in a form that disbanded militias but maintained\nthe right of individuals to their private firearms.” Cramer 858.\n\f30                     MCDONALD v.

Rev. 7, 50 (2008).26 Quite\na few of these state constitutional guarantees, moreover,\nexplicitly protected the right to keep and bear arms as an\nindividual right to self-defense. See Ala. Const., Art. I,\n§28 (1868); Conn. Const., Art. I, §17 (1818); Ky. Const.,\nArt. XIII, §25 (1850); Mich. Const., Art. XVIII, §7 (1850);\nMiss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Mo. Const., Art.

I, §24 (1889); see also State v.\nMcAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238 (Wyo. 1986). What is\nmore, state constitutions adopted during the Reconstruc\ntion era by former Confederate States included a right to\nkeep and bear arms. See, e.g., Ark. Const., Art. I, §5\n(1868); Miss. Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,\n§13 (1869). A clear majority of the States in 1868, there\nfore, recognized the right to keep and bear arms as being\namong the foundational rights necessary to our system of\nGovernment.27\n——————\n  26 More generally worded provisions in the constitutions of seven\nother States may also have encompassed a right to bear arms. See\nCalabresi & Agudo, 87 Texas L. Rev., at 52.\n  27 These state constitutional protections often reflected a lack of law\n\nenforcement in many sections of the country. In the frontier towns that\ndid not have an effective police force, law enforcement often could not\npursue criminals beyond the town borders.

They argue\nthat Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment “as an antidiscrimination\nrule,” and they cite statements to the effect that the sec\ntion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.\nThis argument is implausible.\n   First, while §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains\n“an antidiscrimination rule,” namely, the Equal Protection\nClause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that §1\ndoes no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were\nso, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,\nwould not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the\nrights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the\nFourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not\nprohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only\ndiscriminatory searches and seizures—and so on. We\nassume that this is not municipal respondents’ view, so\nwhat they must mean is that the Second Amendment\nshould be singled out for special—and specially unfavor\nable—treatment. We reject that suggestion.\n   Second, municipal respondents’ argument ignores the\n——————\n36, 42).\n\f32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclear terms of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which\nacknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If\nthat law had used language such as “the equal benefit of\nlaws concerning the bearing of arms,” it would be possible\nto interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina\ntion. But §14 speaks of and protects “the constitutional\nright to bear arms,” an unmistakable reference to the\nright protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro\ntects the “full and equal benefit” of this right in the States.\n14 Stat. 176–177. It would have been nonsensical for\nCongress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a\nconstitutional right that does not exist.\n   Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those\nlaws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous\ncondition of servitude, African Americans in the South\nwould likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many\nof their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace\nofficers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,\na law banning the possession of guns by all private citi\nzens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for\nmal sense. Any such law—like the Chicago and Oak Park\nordinances challenged here—presumably would have\npermitted the possession of guns by those acting under the\nauthority of the State and would thus have left firearms in\nthe hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as\nthe Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction\nrevealed, see supra, at 24–25, those groups were widely\ninvolved in harassing blacks in the South.\n   Fourth, municipal respondents’ purely antidiscrimina\ntion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the\nplight of whites in the South who opposed the Black\nCodes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had\nsimply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the\nbearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have\nbeen left without the means of self-defense—as had aboli\ntionists in Kansas in the 1850’s.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,\nsupra, 20–21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate\nthe members’ right to bear arms, and it was ultimately\ndecided to disband the militias but not to disarm their\nmembers. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §6, 14 Stat. 485, 487;\nHalbrook, Freedmen 68–69; Cramer 858–861. It cannot\nbe doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a\nsubstantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded\nmanner.\n                             IV\n  Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war\nwith our central holding in Heller: that the Second\nAmendment protects a personal right to keep and bear\narms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense\nwithin the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us\nto treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class\nright, subject to an entirely different body of rules than\nthe other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be\nincorporated into the Due Process Clause.\n  Municipal respondents’ main argument is nothing less\nthan a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece\ndent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by\ngone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due\nProcess Clause protects only those rights “ ‘recognized by\nall temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and\nuniversal sense of [their] justice.’ ” Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,\nat 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi\nble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not\nrecognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause\n\f34                     MCDONALD v.

Therefore, the municipal re\nspondents continue, because such countries as England,\nCanada, Australia, Japan, Denmark, Finland, Luxem\nbourg, and New Zealand either ban or severely limit\nhandgun ownership, it must follow that no right to possess\nsuch weapons is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nId., at 21–23.\n  This line of argument is, of course, inconsistent with the\nlong-established standard we apply in incorporation cases.\nSee Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14. And the pre\nsent-day implications of municipal respondents’ argument\nare stunning. For example, many of the rights that our\nBill of Rights provides for persons accused of criminal\noffenses are virtually unique to this country.28 If our\n——————\n  28 For example, the United States affords criminal jury trials far more\nbroadly than other countries.

Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 18–20, 23.\n   There is nothing new in the argument that, in order to\nrespect federalism and allow useful state experimentation,\na federal constitutional right should not be fully binding\non the States. This argument was made repeatedly and\neloquently by Members of this Court who rejected the\nconcept of incorporation and urged retention of the two\ntrack approach to incorporation. Throughout the era of\n“selective incorporation,” Justice Harlan in particular,\ninvoking the values of federalism and state experimenta\ntion, fought a determined rearguard action to preserve the\ntwo-track approach. See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354\nU. S. 476, 500–503 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result\nin part and dissenting in part); Mapp, supra, at 678–680\n(Harlan, J., dissenting); Gideon, 372 U. S., at 352 (Harlan,\nJ., concurring); Malloy, 378 U. S., at 14–33 (Harlan, J.,\ndissenting); Pointer, 380 U. S., at 408–409 (Harlan, J.,\nconcurring in result); Washington, 388 U. S., at 23–24\n(Harlan, J., concurring in result); Duncan, 391 U. S., at\n171–193 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Benton, 395 U. S., at\n808–809 (Harlan, J., dissenting); Williams v. Florida, 399\nU. S. 78, 117 (1970) (Harlan, J., dissenting in part and\nconcurring in result in part).\n   Time and again, however, those pleas failed. Unless we\nturn back the clock or adopt a special incorporation test\napplicable only to the Second Amendment, municipal\nrespondents’ argument must be rejected. Under our prece\ndents, if a Bill of Rights guarantee is fundamental from an\nAmerican perspective, then, unless stare decisis counsels\n\f38                     MCDONALD v.

As noted by the 38 States that have appeared\nin this case as amici supporting petitioners, “[s]tate and\nlocal experimentation with reasonable firearms regula\ntions will continue under the Second Amendment.” Brief\nfor State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 23.\n   Municipal respondents and their amici complain that\nincorporation of the Second Amendment right will lead to\nextensive and costly litigation, but this argument applies\nwith even greater force to constitutional rights and reme\ndies that have already been held to be binding on the\nStates. Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the\nexclusionary rule “is not an individual right,” Herring v.\nUnited States, 555 U. S. ___ (2009) (slip op., at 5), but a\n“judicially created rule,” id., at ___ (slip op., at 4), this\nCourt made the rule applicable to the States. See Mapp,\nsupra, at 660. The exclusionary rule is said to result in\n“tens of thousands of contested suppression motions each\nyear.” Stuntz, The Virtues and Vices of the Exclusionary\nRule, 20 Harv. J. Law & Pub. Pol’y, 443, 444 (1997).\n——————\n   30 As noted above, see n. 13, supra, cases that predate the era of selec\n\ntive incorporation held that the Grand Jury Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment and the Seventh Amendment’s civil jury requirement do\nnot apply to the States. See Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(indictment); Minneapolis & St. Louis R. Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211\n(1916) (civil jury).\n   As a result of Hurtado, most States do not require a grand jury\nindictment in all felony cases, and many have no grand juries. See\nDept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Bureau of Justice Statis\ntics, State Court Organization 2004, pp. 213, 215–217 (2006) (Table 38),\nonline at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/sco04.pdf.\n   As a result of Bombolis, cases that would otherwise fall within the\nSeventh Amendment are now tried without a jury in state small claims\ncourts. See, e.g., Cheung v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 121 Nev. 867,\n124 P. 3d 550 (2005) (no right to jury trial in small claims court under\nNevada Constitution).\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 23–31. In Heller, however, we\nexpressly rejected the argument that the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right should be determined by judicial\ninterest balancing, 554 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 62–\n63), and this Court decades ago abandoned “the notion\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only\na watered-down, subjective version of the individual guar\nantees of the Bill of Rights,” Malloy, supra, at 10–11 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not\nhistorically been understood to restrict the authority of the\nStates to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and\nsupporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms\nlaws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking\nabout their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining\nbans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller.\nMunicipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the\nlate 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See\nBrief for Municipal Respondents 26–27 (citing Kalodimos\nv. Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 470 N. E. 2d 266 (1984));\nsee also Reply Brief for Respondents NRA et al. 23, n. 7\n(asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete\nban on the possession of handguns). It is important to\nkeep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that\nprohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recog\nnized that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a right\nto keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner\nwhatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 54). We made it clear in Heller that our hold\ning did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory\nmeasures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by\nfelons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying\n\f40                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nof firearms in sensitive places such as schools and gov\nernment buildings, or laws imposing conditions and quali\nfications on the commercial sale of arms.” Id., at ___–___\n(slip op., at 54–55). We repeat those assurances here.\nDespite municipal respondents’ doomsday proclamations,\nincorporation does not imperil every law regulating\nfirearms.\n   Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to\nkeep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in\nthe first eight Amendments “because the reason for codify\ning the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs\nfrom the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in\nself-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in\nthe concept of ordered liberty.” Brief for Municipal Re\nspondents 36–37. Municipal respondents suggest that the\nSecond Amendment right differs from the rights hereto\nfore incorporated because the latter were “valued for\n[their] own sake.” Id., at 33. But we have never previ\nously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on\nwhether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,\nand quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo\nrated—for example the right to counsel and the right to\nconfront and subpoena witnesses—are clearly instrumen\ntal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages\none of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,\nthat the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined\nby the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that\nright in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that\nthe codification of this right was prompted by fear that the\nFederal Government would disarm and thus disable the\nmilitias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was\nvalued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). On the contrary, we stressed\nthat the right was also valued because the possession of\nfirearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As\nwe put it, self-defense was “the central component of the\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).\nThe question presented in this case, in his view, “is\nwhether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap\nplies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment\nitself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 27. He would\nhold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringe\nment by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\nneed not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro\ntected against Federal Government infringement by the\nvarious provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 9.\n   As we have explained, the Court, for the past half\ncentury, has moved away from the two-track approach. If\nwe were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS’ theory across the\nboard, decades of decisions would be undermined. We\nassume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged\ninstead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for\nthe individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous\ndissents.\n   The relationship between the Bill of Rights’ guarantees\nand the States must be governed by a single, neutral\nprinciple. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren\nnan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the\nnotion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the\nStates only a watered-down, subjective version of the\nindividual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy,\nsupra, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f42                MCDONALD v.

To begin, while there is certainly room\nfor disagreement about Heller’s analysis of the history of\nthe right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since\nHeller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.\nFew other questions of original meaning have been as\nthoroughly explored.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s conclusion that the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the right to keep and\nbear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,\n“there is no popular consensus” that the right is funda\nmental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi\nnorities or persons neglected by those holding political\npower, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second\nAmendment right would “amount to a significant incur\nsion on a traditional and important area of state concern,\naltering the constitutional relationship between the States\nand the Federal Government” and preventing local varia\ntions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right in cases involving state and\nlocal laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical\nquestions regarding matters that are outside their area of\nexpertise, post, at 11–16. Even if we believed that these\nfactors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of\nthese factors undermines the case for incorporation of the\nright to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n   First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of\nRights applies to the States only if there is a “popular\nconsensus” that the right is fundamental, and we see no\nbasis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,\nthere is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief\nsubmitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members\nof the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the\nright to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for\nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as Amici Curiae 4.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.\n  Second, petitioners and many others who live in high\ncrime areas dispute the proposition that the Second\nAmendment right does not protect minorities and those\nlacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in\nhigh-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi\nnois legislators representing Chicago districts called on\nthe Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to\npatrol the City’s streets.31 The legislators noted that the\nnumber of Chicago homicide victims during the current\nyear equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur\ning that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that\n80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting\nincorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend\nthat the right is especially important for women and\nmembers of other groups that may be especially vulner\nable to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their\nsafety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the\ncommunity would be enhanced by the possession of hand\nguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second\nAmendment right protects the rights of minorities and\nother residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not\nbeing met by elected public officials.\n——————\n  31 See Mack & Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to\n\nChicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.\n  32 Janssen & Knowles, Send in Troops?

Incorpora\ntion always restricts experimentation and local variations,\nbut that has not stopped the Court from incorporating\nvirtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. “[T]he\nenshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes\ncertain policy choices off the table.” Heller, 554 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable\nwith respect to the Second Amendment than it is with\nrespect to all the other limitations on state power found in\nthe Constitution.\n   Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation\nwill require judges to assess the costs and benefits of\nfirearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical\njudgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we\nhave noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an\ninterest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that\nsuggestion. See supra, at 38–39. “The very enumeration\nof the right takes out of the hands of government—even\nthe Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on\na case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth\ninsisting upon.” Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62–63).\n                        *    *    *\n  In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects\nthe right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose\nof self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis\ncounsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that\nprotects a right that is fundamental from an American\nperspective applies equally to the Federal Government\nand the States. See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14.\nWe therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amend\nment right recognized in Heller.

Oliver, 510 U. S.\n266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring). This case does\nnot require me to reconsider that view, since straightfor­\nward application of settled doctrine suffices to decide it.\n   I write separately only to respond to some aspects of\nJUSTICE STEVENS’ dissent. Not that aspect which dis­\nagrees with the majority’s application of our precedents to\nthis case, which is fully covered by the Court’s opinion.\nBut much of what JUSTICE STEVENS writes is a broad\ncondemnation of the theory of interpretation which under­\nlies the Court’s opinion, a theory that makes the traditions\nof our people paramount. He proposes a different theory,\nwhich he claims is more “cautiou[s]” and respectful of\nproper limits on the judicial role. Post, at 57. It is that\nclaim I wish to address.\n                           I\n                           A\n  After stressing the substantive dimension of what he\n\f2                    MCDONALD v.

Connecticut, 302\nU. S. 319, 325 (1937), see post, at 14–20. But in fact he\ndoes not favor application of that theory at all. For\nwhether Palko requires only that “a fair and enlightened\nsystem of justice would be impossible without” the right\nsought to be incorporated, 302 U. S., at 325, or requires in\naddition that the right be rooted in the “traditions and\nconscience of our people,” ibid. (internal quotation marks\nomitted), many of the rights JUSTICE STEVENS thinks are\nincorporated could not pass muster under either test:\nabortion, post, at 7 (citing Planned Parenthood of South\neastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847 (1992)); homosex­\nual sodomy, post, at 16 (citing Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.

Not all\nsuch rights are in, however, since only “some fundamental\naspects of personhood, dignity, and the like” are protected,\npost, at 24 (emphasis added). Exactly what is covered is\nnot clear. But whatever else is in, he knows that the right\nto keep and bear arms is out, despite its being as “deeply\nrooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U.

I can find no\nother explanation for such certitude except that JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, despite his forswearing of “personal and private\nnotions,” post, at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted),\ndeeply believes it should be out.\n   The subjective nature of JUSTICE STEVENS’ standard is\nalso apparent from his claim that it is the courts’ preroga­\ntive—indeed their duty—to update the Due Process Clause\nso that it encompasses new freedoms the Framers were\ntoo narrow-minded to imagine, post, at 19–20, and n. 21.\nCourts, he proclaims, must “do justice to [the Clause’s]\nurgent call and its open texture” by exercising the “inter­\npretive discretion the latter embodies.” Post, at 21.

His interpretive\n\napproach applied to incorporation of the Second Amendment includes\nconsideration of such factors as “the extent to which incorporation will\nfurther other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent\nto which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution’s struc­\ntural aims”; whether recognizing a particular right will “further the\nConstitution’s effort to ensure that the government treats each individ­\nual with equal respect” or will “help maintain the democratic form of\ngovernment”; whether it is “inconsistent . . . with the Constitution’s\nefforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying\nout of its constitutional promises”; whether it fits with “the Framers’\nbasic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial\nreview”; courts’ comparative advantage in answering empirical ques­\ntions that may be involved in applying the right; and whether there is a\n“strong offsetting justification” for removing a decision from the democ­\nratic process.

Moreover, trusting the meaning\nof the Due Process Clause to what has historically been\nprotected is circular, see post, at 19, since that would\nmean no new rights could get in.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS moves on to the “most basic” con­\nstraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would\n“esche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down,\ntotalizing theory of ‘liberty.’ ” Post, at 22. The notion that\nthe absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause\nwill somehow curtail judicial caprice is at war with reason.\nIndeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose\nwhatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution.\nThe idea that interpretive pluralism would reduce courts’\nability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not\nmerely naïve, but absurd. If there are no right answers,\nthere are no wrong answers either.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that requiring courts to\nshow “respect for the democratic process” should serve as\na constraint. Post, at 23. That is true, but JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would have them show respect in an extraordi­\nnary manner. In his view, if a right “is already being\ngiven careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing\ncalibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be\nappropriate.” Ibid. In other words, a right, such as the\nright to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized\nbut on which the States are considering restrictions, ap­\nparently deserves less protection, while a privilege the\npolitical branches (instruments of the democratic process)\nhave withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves\nmore. That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accom­\nplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court\nheld protected in Casey, Lawrence, and other such cases fit\nthe theory—but at the cost of insulting rather than re­\nspecting the democratic process.\n  The next constraint JUSTICE STEVENS suggests is harder\n\f6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nto evaluate. He describes as “an important tool for guiding\njudicial discretion” “sensitivity to the interaction between\nthe intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of\ncontemporary society.” Post, at 24. I cannot say whether\nthat sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no\nidea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges\nwhen they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges\nare more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic\nconflict between liberty and its potentially harmful conse­\nquences? Attempting to give the concept more precision,\nJUSTICE STEVENS explains that “sensitivity is an aspect of\na deeper principle: the need to approach our work with\nhumility and caution.” Ibid. Both traits are undeniably\nadmirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is\na mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case\nJUSTICE STEVENS cites in support, see ibid., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful\nform of judicial modesty in mind.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS offers no examples to illustrate the\nnext constraint: stare decisis, post, at 25. But his view of it\nis surely not very confining, since he holds out as a “ca­\nnonical” exemplar of the proper approach, see post, at 16,\n54, Lawrence, which overruled a case decided a mere 17\nyears earlier, Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986),\nsee 539 U. S., at 578 (it “was not correct when it was\ndecided, and it is not correct today”). Moreover, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would apply that constraint unevenly: He appar­\nently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot­\nfor-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal\ndefendants, post, at 11, but would abandon those Warren\nCourt rulings that undercut his approach to substantive\nrights, on the basis that we have “cut back” on cases from\nthat era before, post, at 12.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also relies on the requirement of a\n“careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty\ninterest” to limit judicial discretion. Post, at 25 (internal\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nquotation marks omitted). I certainly agree with that\nrequirement, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993),\nthough some cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have not\napplied it seriously, see, e.g., Lawrence, supra, at 562\n(“The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its\nspatial and in its more transcendent dimensions”). But if\nthe “careful description” requirement is used in the man­\nner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of\ndetermining the Due Process Clause’s “conceptual core,”\npost, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we\nsought a careful, specific description of the right at issue\nin order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly\ndefined, was fundamental. See, e.g., Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 722–728; Reno, supra, at 302–306; Collins v.\nHarker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125–129 (1992); Cruzan v.\nDirector, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269–279\n(1990); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 801–808\n(1997). The threshold step of defining the asserted right\nwith precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as\nJUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the “conceptual core” of the\n“liberty clause,” post, at 23, includes a number of capa­\ncious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define\nthe right with much precision in order to conclude that it\npertains to the plaintiff’s “ability independently to define\n[his] identity,” his “right to make certain unusually impor­\ntant decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s,\ndestiny,” or some aspect of his “[s]elf-determination, bodily\nintegrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,\npolitical equality, dignity [or] respect.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there­\nfore have in mind some other use for the careful­\ndescription requirement—perhaps just as a means of\nensuring that courts “procee[d] slowly and incrementally,”\npost, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by\n\f8                      MCDONALD v.

He offers several reasons for concluding that the\nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not\nfundamental enough to be applied against the States.5\nNone is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose,\neach is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude\nincorporation of rights we have already held incorporated,\nor both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a\njudge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that\n\n——————\n    4 After\n          defending the careful-description criterion, JUSTICE STEVENS\nquickly retreats and cautions courts not to apply it too stringently.\nPost, at 26. Describing a right too specifically risks robbing it of its\n“universal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have,” ibid.,\nand “loads the dice against its recognition,” post, at 26, n. 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That must be avoided, since it endangers\nrights JUSTICE STEVENS does like. See ibid. (discussing Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003)). To make sure those rights get in, we must\nleave leeway in our description, so that a right that has not itself been\nrecognized as fundamental can ride the coattails of one that has been.\n  5 JUSTICE STEVENS claims that I mischaracterize his argument by\n\nreferring to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\ninstead of “the interest in keeping a firearm of one’s choosing in the\nhome,” the right he says petitioners assert. Post, at 38, n. 36. But it is\nprecisely the “Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms” that\npetitioners argue is incorporated by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,\nPet. for Cert. i. Under JUSTICE STEVENS’ own approach, that should end\nthe matter. See post, at 26 (“[W]e must pay close attention to the\nprecise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate”). In\nany event, the demise of watered-down incorporation, see ante, at 17–\n19, means that we no longer subdivide Bill of Rights guarantees into\ntheir theoretical components, only some of which apply to the States.\nThe First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated—not the\nfreedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Post, at\n35. The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liber­\nties deserve Due Process protection is never explained—\nproof that judges applying JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach can\nadd new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion,\nmoreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely JUSTICE\nSTEVENS does not mean that the Clause covers only rights\nthat have zero harmful effect on anyone. Otherwise even\nthe First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is\nthat the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a\nrisk to others’ physical well-being. But as the plurality\nexplains, ante, at 35–36, other rights we have already held\nincorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public\nsafety. In all events, JUSTICE STEVENS supplies neither a\nstandard for how severe the impairment on others’ liberty\nmust be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any\nmethod of measuring the severity.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next suggests that the Second\nAmendment right is not fundamental because it is “differ­\nent in kind” from other rights we have recognized. Post, at\n37. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear\narms is different from some other rights we have held the\nClause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply\ngrounded in our nation’s history and tradition. But\nJUSTICE STEVENS has a different distinction in mind:\nEven though he does “not doubt for a moment that many\nAmericans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life\nas well as to their security,” he pronounces that owning a\nhandgun is not “critical to leading a life of autonomy,\ndignity, or political equality.”6 Post, at 37–38. Who says?\n——————\n   6 JUSTICE STEVENS goes a step farther still, suggesting that the right\n\nto keep and bear arms is not protected by the “liberty clause” because it\nis not really a liberty at all, but a “property right.” Post, at 38. Never\n\f10                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nDeciding what is essential to an enlightened, liberty-filled\nlife is an inherently political, moral judgment—the an­\ntithesis of an objective approach that reaches conclusions\nby applying neutral rules to verifiable evidence.7\n   No determination of what rights the Constitution of the\nUnited States covers would be complete, of course, without\na survey of what other countries do. Post, at 40–41. When\nit comes to guns, JUSTICE STEVENS explains, our Nation is\nalready an outlier among “advanced democracies”; not\neven our “oldest allies” protect as robust a right as we do,\nand we should not widen the gap. Ibid. Never mind that\nhe explains neither which countries qualify as “advanced\ndemocracies” nor why others are irrelevant. For there is\nan even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges\npick which rights States must respect and those they can\nignore: As the plurality shows, ante, at 34–35, and nn. 28–\n29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would fore­\n——————\nmind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; and\nnever mind that the “liberty clause” is really a Due Process Clause\nwhich explicitly protects “property,” see United States v. Carlton, 512\nU. S. 26, 41–42 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). JUSTICE\nSTEVENS’ theory cannot explain why the Takings Clause, which unques­\ntionably protects property, has been incorporated, see Chicago, B. & Q.\nR. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226, 241 (1897), in a decision he appears to\naccept, post, at 14, n. 14.\n   7 As JUSTICE STEVENS notes, see post, at 51–52, I accept as a matter of\n\nstare decisis the requirement that to be fundamental for purposes of the\nDue Process Clause, a right must be “implicit in the concept of ordered\nliberty,” Lawrence, supra, at 593, n. 3 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). But that inquiry provides infinitely less\nscope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court’s ap­\nproach, since the field of candidates is immensely narrowed by the prior\nrequirement that a right be rooted in this country’s traditions. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that\nhe thinks “implicit in the concept, etc.” The point JUSTICE STEVENS\nmakes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical\napproach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than\nhis in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so. See\nPart III, infra.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

A judge applying JUSTICE\nSTEVENS’ approach must either throw all of those rights\noverboard or, as cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have\ndone in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore\nforeign law when it undermines the desired conclusion,\nsee, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (making no mention of\nforeign law).\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that since the right to\nkeep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of “pre­\nvent[ing] elimination of the militia,” it should be viewed as\n“ ‘a federalism provision’ ” logically incapable of incorpora­\ntion. Post, at 41–42 (quoting Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., con­\ncurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks\nomitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when\njudges want it to. The opinion JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nfor the “federalism provision” principle, JUSTICE THOMAS’s\nconcurrence in Newdow, argued that incorporation of the\nEstablishment Clause “makes little sense” because that\nClause was originally understood as a limit on congres­\nsional interference with state establishments of religion.\nId., at 49–51. JUSTICE STEVENS, of course, has no problem\nwith applying the Establishment Clause to the States.\nSee, e.g., id., at 8, n. 4 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS,\nJ.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause\n“appl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Four­\nteenth Amendment”). While he insists that Clause is not a\n“federalism provision,” post, at 42, n. 40, he does not ex­\nplain why it is not, but the right to keep and bear arms is\n(even though only the latter refers to a “right of the peo­\nple”). The “federalism” argument prevents the incorpora­\ntion of only certain rights.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next argues that even if the right to\n\f12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nkeep and bear arms is “deeply rooted in some important\nsenses,” the roots of States’ efforts to regulate guns run\njust as deep. Post, at 44 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). But this too is true of other rights we have held\nincorporated. No fundamental right—not even the First\nAmendment—is absolute. The traditional restrictions go\nto show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental\ncharacter. At least that is what they show (JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would agree) for other rights. Once again, prin­\nciples are applied selectively.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS’ final reason for rejecting incorpora­\ntion of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than\nany of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that\nthere is a “plausible constitutional basis” for holding that\nthe right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts\nthat we ought not to do so for prudential reasons. Post, at\n47. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that\nare within the Constitution’s command (and we assuredly\ndo not), two of the reasons JUSTICE STEVENS gives for\nabstention show just how much power he would hand to\njudges. The States’ “right to experiment” with solutions to\nthe problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here\nbecause “the best solution is far from clear.” Post, at 47–\n48 (internal quotation marks omitted). That is true of\nmost serious social problems—whether, for example, “the\nbest solution” for rampant crime is to admit confessions\nunless they are affirmatively shown to have been coerced,\nbut see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 444–445\n(1966), or to permit jurors to impose the death penalty\nwithout a requirement that they be free to consider “any\nrelevant mitigating factor,” see Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\nU. S. 104, 112 (1982), which in turn leads to the conclusion\nthat defense counsel has provided inadequate defense if he\nhas not conducted a “reasonable investigation” into poten­\ntially mitigating factors, see, e.g., Wiggins v. Smith, 539\nU. S. 510, 534 (2003), inquiry into which question tends to\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. ___ (2009) (per curiam) (reversing\ngrant of habeas relief for sentencing on a crime committed\nin 1981). The obviousness of the optimal answer is in the\neye of the beholder. The implication of JUSTICE STEVENS’\ncall for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that\nThey The People’s answers to a problem are silly, we are\nfree to “interven[e],” post, at 47, but if we too are uncertain\nof the right answer, or merely think the States may be on\nto something, we can loosen the leash.\n   A second reason JUSTICE STEVENS says we should ab­\nstain is that the States have shown they are “capable” of\nprotecting the right at issue, and if anything have pro­\ntected it too much. Post, at 49. That reflects an assump­\ntion that judges can distinguish between a proper democ­\nratic decision to leave things alone (which we should\nhonor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we\nshould step in to correct). I would not—and no judge\nshould—presume to have that sort of omniscience, which\nseems to me far more “arrogant,” post, at 41, than confin­\ning courts’ focus to our own national heritage.\n                              III\n   JUSTICE STEVENS’ response to this concurrence, post, at\n51–56, makes the usual rejoinder of “living Constitution”\nadvocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to\neliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The\ntraditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes\ndiscretion in judges as well.8 Historical analysis can be\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS also asserts that his approach is “more faithful to\nthis Nation’s constitutional history” and to “the values and commit­\nments of the American people, as they stand today,” post, at 54. But\nwhat he asserts to be the proof of this is that his approach aligns (no\nsurprise) with those cases he approves (and dubs “canonical,” ibid.).\nCases he disfavors are discarded as “hardly bind[ing]” “excesses,” post,\nat 12, or less “enduring,” post, at 17, n. 16.

CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ndifficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold ques­\ntions, and making nuanced judgments about which evi­\ndence to consult and how to interpret it.\n   I will stipulate to that.9 But the question to be decided\nis not whether the historically focused method is a perfect\nmeans of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution­\nwriting; but whether it is the best means available in an\nimperfect world. Or indeed, even more narrowly than\nthat: whether it is demonstrably much better than what\nJUSTICE STEVENS proposes. I think it beyond all serious\ndispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much\nless upon the democratic process. It is less subjective\nbecause it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of\nreasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico­\npolitical First Principles whose combined conclusion can\nbe found to point in any direction the judges favor. In the\nmost controversial matters brought before this Court—for\nexample, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion,\nassisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitu­\ntionality of the death penalty—any historical methodology,\nunder any plausible standard of proof, would lead to the\nsame conclusion.10 Moreover, the methodological differ­\nences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive\n——————\ncommitments of the American people” (and that is unclear, see post, at\n48–49, n. 47), it is hard to see how it shows fidelity to them that he\ndisapproves a different subset of old cases than the Court does.\n   9 That is not to say that every historical question on which there is\n\nroom for debate is indeterminate, or that every question on which\nhistorians disagree is equally balanced. Cf. post, at 52–53. For exam­\nple, the historical analysis of the principal dissent in Heller is as valid\nas the Court’s only in a two-dimensional world that conflates length\nand depth.\n   10 By the way, JUSTICE STEVENS greatly magnifies the difficulty of an\n\nhistorical approach by suggesting that it was my burden in Lawrence to\nshow the “ancient roots of proscriptions against sodomy,” post, at 53\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Au contraire, it was his burden (in\nthe opinion he joined) to show the ancient roots of the right of sodomy.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

And\nwhether or not special expertise is needed to answer his­\ntorical questions, judges most certainly have no “compara­\ntive . . . advantage,” post, at 24 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), in resolving moral disputes. What is more, his\napproach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard\nquestions courts must confront, since he would not replace\nhistory with moral philosophy, but would have courts\nconsider both.\n   And the Court’s approach intrudes less upon the democ­\nratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those\nestablished by a constitutional history formed by democ­\nratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are\nleft to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,\nwith the assurance that their decision is not subject to\njudicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach, on the\nother hand, deprives the people of that power, since what­\never the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro­\ntected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After\nall, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at\n55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.\nJUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which “majorities or\npowerful interest groups always get their way,” post, at 56,\nbut replaces it with a system in which unelected and life­\ntenured judges always get their way. That such usurpa­\ntion is effected unabashedly, see post, at 53—with “the\njudge’s cards . . . laid on the table,” ibid.—makes it even\nworse. In a vibrant democracy, usurpation should have to\nbe accomplished in the dark. It is JUSTICE STEVENS’ ap­\nproach, not the Court’s, that puts democracy in peril.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot agree that it is enforceable against the\nStates through a clause that speaks only to “process.”\nInstead, the right to keep and bear arms is a privilege of\nAmerican citizenship that applies to the States through\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\nClause.\n\f2                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n                               I\n   In District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. ___ (2008),\nthis Court held that the Second Amendment protects an\nindividual right to keep and bear arms for the purpose of\nself-defense, striking down a District of Columbia ordi\nnance that banned the possession of handguns in the\nhome. Id., at __ (slip op., at 64). The question in this case\nis whether the Constitution protects that right against\nabridgment by the States.\n   As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption in 1868, the an\nswer to that question would be simple. In Barron ex rel.\nTiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), this\nCourt held that the Bill of Rights applied only to the Fed\neral Government. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice\nMarshall recalled that the founding generation added the\nfirst eight Amendments to the Constitution in response to\nAntifederalist concerns regarding the extent of federal—\nnot state—power, and held that if “the framers of these\namendments [had] intended them to be limitations on the\npowers of the state governments,” “they would have de\nclared this purpose in plain and intelligible language.”\nId., at 250. Finding no such language in the Bill, Chief\nJustice Marshall held that it did not in any way restrict\nstate authority. Id., at 248–250; see Lessee of Livingston\nv. Moore, 7 Pet. 469, 551–552 (1833) (reaffirming Barron’s\nholding); Permoli v. Municipality No. 1 of New Orleans, 3\nHow. 589, 609–610 (1845) (same).\n   Nearly three decades after Barron, the Nation was\nsplintered by a civil war fought principally over the ques\ntion of slavery. As was evident to many throughout our\nNation’s early history, slavery, and the measures designed\nto protect it, were irreconcilable with the principles of\nequality, government by consent, and inalienable rights\nproclaimed by the Declaration of Independence and em\nbedded in our constitutional structure.

Farrand ed.\n1911) (remarks of Luther Martin) (“[S]lavery is inconsis\ntent with the genius of republicanism, and has a tendency\nto destroy those principles on which it is supported, as it\nlessens the sense of the equal rights of mankind” (empha\nsis deleted)); A. Lincoln, Speech at Peoria, Ill. (Oct. 16,\n1854), reprinted in 2 The Collected Works of Abraham\nLincoln 266 (R. Basler ed. 1953) (“[N]o man is good enough\nto govern another man, without that other’s consent. I say\nthis is the leading principle—the sheet anchor of American\nrepublicanism. . . . Now the relation of masters and slaves\nis, pro tanto, a total violation of this principle”).\n   After the war, a series of constitutional amendments\nwere adopted to repair the Nation from the damage slav\nery had caused. The provision at issue here, §1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system\nof government. The first sentence of that section provides\nthat “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the\nUnited States and of the State wherein they reside.” This\nunambiguously overruled this Court’s contrary holding in\nDred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), that the\nConstitution did not recognize black Americans as citizens\nof the United States or their own State. Id., at 405–406.\n   The meaning of §1’s next sentence has divided this\nCourt for many years. That sentence begins with the\ncommand that “[n]o State shall make or enforce any law\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citi\nzens of the United States.” On its face, this appears to\ngrant the persons just made United States citizens a\ncertain collection of rights—i.e., privileges or immunities—\nattributable to that status.\n   This Court’s precedents accept that point, but define the\nrelevant collection of rights quite narrowly.         In the\nSlaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36 (1873), decided just\nfive years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption, the\n\f4                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely\ndivided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction be\ntween the privileges and immunities of state citizenship\nand those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter cate\ngory of rights from state abridgment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt defined that category to include only those rights\n“which owe their existence to the Federal government, its\nNational character, its Constitution, or its laws.” Id., at\n79. This arguably left open the possibility that certain\nindividual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be\nconsidered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.\nSee ibid. (listing “[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and\n“the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus” as rights poten\ntially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).\nBut the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly\nin its later cases.\n   Chief among those cases is United States v. Cruikshank,\n92 U. S. 542 (1876). There, the Court held that members\nof a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as\n165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse\nhad not deprived the victims of their privileges as Ameri\ncan citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear\narms. Ibid.; see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).\nAccording to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble\ncodified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of\nUnited States citizenship because “[t]he right . . . existed\nlong before the adoption of the Constitution.” 92 U. S., at\n551 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the\nright to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United\nStates citizenship because it was not “in any manner\ndependent upon that instrument for its existence.” Id., at\n553. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the\nright to bear arms in the Second Amendment—its nature\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                    5\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nas an inalienable right that pre-existed the Constitution’s\nadoption—was the very reason citizens could not enforce it\nagainst States through the Fourteenth.\n   That circular reasoning effectively has been the Court’s\nlast word on the Privileges or Immunities Clause.1 In the\nintervening years, the Court has held that the Clause\nprevents state abridgment of only a handful of rights, such\nas the right to travel, see Saenz v. Roe, 526 U. S. 489, 503\n(1999), that are not readily described as essential to\nliberty.\n   As a consequence of this Court’s marginalization of the\nClause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental\nrights turned to the remainder of §1 in search of an alter\nnative fount of such rights. They found one in a most\ncurious place—that section’s command that every State\nguarantee “due process” to any person before depriving\nhim of “life, liberty, or property.” At first, litigants argued\nthat this Due Process Clause “incorporated” certain proce\ndural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the\nStates. The Court generally rejected those claims, how\never, on the theory that the rights in question were not\nsufficiently “fundamental” to warrant such treatment.\nSee, e.g., Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884)\n(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v. Dow, 176\nU. S. 581 (1900) (12-person jury requirement); Twining v.\nNew Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908) (privilege against self\nincrimination).\n   That changed with time. The Court came to conclude\nthat certain Bill of Rights guarantees were sufficiently\nfundamental to fall within §1’s guarantee of “due process.”\nThese included not only procedural protections listed in\n——————\n   1 In the two decades after United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542\n\n(1876), was decided, this Court twice reaffirmed its holding that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause does not apply the Second Amendment\nto the States. Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, 266–267 (1886); Miller\nv. Texas, 153 U. S. 535 (1894).\n\f6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe first eight Amendments, see, e.g., Benton v. Maryland,\n395 U. S. 784 (1969) (protection against double jeopardy),\nbut substantive rights as well, see, e.g., Gitlow v. New\nYork, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925) (right to free speech); Near\nv. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697, 707 (1931)\n(same). In the process of incorporating these rights\nagainst the States, the Court often applied them differ\nently against the States than against the Federal Gov\nernment on the theory that only those “fundamental”\naspects of the right required Due Process Clause protec\ntion. See, e.g., Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455, 473 (1942)\n(holding that the Sixth Amendment required the appoint\nment of counsel in all federal criminal cases in which the\ndefendant was unable to retain an attorney, but that the\nDue Process Clause required appointment of counsel in\nstate criminal cases only where “want of counsel . . . re\nsult[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental fair\nness”). In more recent years, this Court has “abandoned\nthe notion” that the guarantees in the Bill of Rights apply\ndifferently when incorporated against the States than they\ndo when applied to the Federal Government. Ante, at 17–\n18 (opinion of the Court) (internal quotation marks omit\nted). But our cases continue to adhere to the view that a\nright is incorporated through the Due Process Clause only\nif it is sufficiently “fundamental,” ante, at 37, 42–44 (plu\nrality opinion)—a term the Court has long struggled to\ndefine.\n   While this Court has at times concluded that a right\ngains “fundamental” status only if it is essential to the\nAmerican “scheme of ordered liberty” or “ ‘deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 19 (plurality\nopinion) (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), the Court\nhas just as often held that a right warrants Due Process\nClause protection if it satisfies a far less measurable range\nof criteria, see Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 562\n(2003) (concluding that the Due Process Clause protects\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            7\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n“liberty of the person both in its spatial and in its more\ntranscendent dimensions”). Using the latter approach, the\nCourt has determined that the Due Process Clause applies\nrights against the States that are not mentioned in the\nConstitution at all, even without seriously arguing that\nthe Clause was originally understood to protect such\nrights. See, e.g., Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905);\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Lawrence, supra.\n   All of this is a legal fiction. The notion that a constitu\ntional provision that guarantees only “process” before a\nperson is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define\nthe substance of those rights strains credulity for even the\nmost casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a\nparticularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the\nCourt’s substantive due process precedents together is\ntheir lack of a guiding principle to distinguish “fundamen\ntal” rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental\nrights that do not. Today’s decision illustrates the point.\nReplaying a debate that has endured from the inception of\nthe Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence, the\ndissents laud the “flexibility” in this Court’s substantive\ndue process doctrine, post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);\nsee post, at 6–8 (BREYER, J., dissenting), while the plural\nity makes yet another effort to impose principled re\nstraints on its exercise, see ante, at 33–41. But neither\nside argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due\nProcess Clause was consistent with public understanding\nat the time of its ratification.\n   To be sure, the plurality’s effort to cabin the exercise of\njudicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focus\ning its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American\nhistory and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse\nthan the alternatives. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissent\ning) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against\nthe States through the Due Process Clause if they are\n“well-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional prom\n\f8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nises”); post, at 22 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (warning that\nthere is no “all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n‘liberty’ ” protected by the Due Process Clause). But any\nserious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause\nmust acknowledge that neither its text nor its history\nsuggests that it protects the many substantive rights this\nCourt’s cases now claim it does.\n   I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation\nthat rests on such tenuous footing. This Court’s substan\ntive due process framework fails to account for both the\ntext of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that\nled to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence\ndevoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original mean\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alter\nnative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this\nCourt to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is\ndesigned to protect with greater clarity and predictability\nthan the substantive due process framework has so far\nmanaged.\n   I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been\nbuilt upon the substantive due process framework, and I\nfurther acknowledge the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation’s legal system. But stare decisis is\nonly an “adjunct” of our duty as judges to decide by our\nbest lights what the Constitution means. Planned Par\nenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 963\n(1992) (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part\nand dissenting in part). It is not “an inexorable com\nmand.” Lawrence, supra, at 577. Moreover, as judges, we\ninterpret the Constitution one case or controversy at a\ntime. The question presented in this case is not whether\nour entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be\npreserved or revised, but only whether, and to what ex\ntent, a particular clause in the Constitution protects the\nparticular right at issue here. With the inquiry appropri\nately narrowed, I believe this case presents an opportunity\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

S. 716, 731 (1931)).\nThus, the objective of this inquiry is to discern what “ordi\nnary citizens” at the time of ratification would have un\nderstood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to mean.\n554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n                              A\n                              1\n   At the time of Reconstruction, the terms “privileges” and\n“immunities” had an established meaning as synonyms for\n“rights.” The two words, standing alone or paired to\ngether, were used interchangeably with the words “rights,”\n“liberties,” and “freedoms,” and had been since the time of\nBlackstone. See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129\n(describing the “rights and liberties” of Englishmen as\n“private immunities” and “civil privileges”). A number of\nantebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this man\nner. See, e.g., Magill v. Brown, 16 F. Cas. 408, 428 (No.\n8,952) (CC ED Pa. 1833) (Baldwin, J.) (“The words ‘privi\n\f10                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nleges and immunities’ relate to the rights of persons, place\nor property; a privilege is a peculiar right, a private law,\nconceded to particular persons or places”). In addition,\ndictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this\nunderstanding. See, e.g., N. Webster, An American Dic\ntionary of the English Language 1039 (C. Goodrich & N.\nPorter rev. 1865) (defining “privilege” as “a right or immu\nnity not enjoyed by others or by all” and listing among its\nsynonyms the words “immunity,” “franchise,” “right,” and\n“liberty”); id., at 661 (defining “immunity” as “[f]reedom\nfrom an obligation” or “particular privilege”); id., at 1140\n(defining “right” as “[p]rivilege or immunity granted by\nauthority”).2\n   The fact that a particular interest was designated as a\n“privilege” or “immunity,” rather than a “right,” “liberty,”\nor “freedom,” revealed little about its substance. Black\nstone, for example, used the terms “privileges” and “im\nmunities” to describe both the inalienable rights of indi\nviduals and the positive-law rights of corporations. See 1\nCommentaries, at *129 (describing “private immunities”\nas a “residuum of natural liberty,” and “civil privileges” as\nthose “which society has engaged to provide, in lieu of the\nnatural liberties so given up by individuals” (footnote\nomitted)); id., at *468 (stating that a corporate charter\nenables a corporation to “establish rules and orders” that\nserve as “the privileges and immunities . . . of the corpora\ntion”).

Calef, 53 Me. 471,\n483–484 (1866) (concluding that a statute did not “modify\nany power, privileges, or immunity, pertaining to the\nfranchise of any corporation”). The nature of a privilege or\nimmunity thus varied depending on the person, group, or\nentity to whom those rights were assigned. See Lash, The\nOrigins of the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Part I:\n“Privileges and Immunities” as an Antebellum Term of\nArt, 98 Geo. L. J. 1241, 1256–1257 (2010) (surveying\nantebellum usages of these terms).\n                              2\n   The group of rights-bearers to whom the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause applies is, of course, “citizens.” By the\ntime of Reconstruction, it had long been established that\nboth the States and the Federal Government existed to\npreserve their citizens’ inalienable rights, and that these\nrights were considered “privileges” or “immunities” of\ncitizenship.\n   This tradition begins with our country’s English roots.\nParliament declared the basic liberties of English citizens\nin a series of documents ranging from the Magna Carta to\nthe Petition of Right and the English Bill of Rights. See 1\nB. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History\n8−16, 19−21, 41−46 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz). These\nfundamental rights, according to the English tradition,\nbelonged to all people but became legally enforceable only\nwhen recognized in legal texts, including acts of Parlia\nment and the decisions of common-law judges. See B.\nBailyn, The Ideological Origins of the American Revolu\ntion 77−79 (1967). These rights included many that later\n\f12                     MCDONALD v.

They consistently claimed the rights of\nEnglish citizenship in their founding documents, repeat\nedly referring to these rights as “privileges” and “immuni\nties.” For example, a Maryland law provided that\n     “[A]ll the Inhabitants of this Province being Chris\n     tians (Slaves excepted) Shall have and enjoy all such\n     rights liberties immunities priviledges and free cus\n     toms within this Province as any naturall born subject\n     of England hath or ought to have or enjoy in the\n     Realm of England . . . .” Md.

In an address delivered to the inhabi\ntants of Quebec that same year, the Congress described\nthose rights as including the “great” “right[s]” of “trial by\njury,” “Habeas Corpus,” and “freedom of the press.” Ad\ndress of the Continental Congress to the Inhabitants of\nQuebec (1774), reprinted in 1 Schwartz 221–223.\n  After declaring their independence, the newly formed\nStates replaced their colonial charters with constitutions\nand state bills of rights, almost all of which guaranteed\nthe same fundamental rights that the former colonists\npreviously had claimed by virtue of their English heritage.\nSee, e. g., Pa. Declaration of Rights (1776), reprinted in 5\nThorpe 3081–3084 (declaring that “all men are born\nequally free and independent, and have certain natural,\ninherent and inalienable rights,” including the “right to\nworship Almighty God according to the dictates of their\nown consciences” and the “right to bear arms for the de\nfence of themselves and the state”).5\n  Several years later, the Founders amended the Consti\ntution to expressly protect many of the same fundamental\nrights against interference by the Federal Government.\nConsistent with their English heritage, the founding\n——————\nStamp Act Crisis, 1764−1766, at 46, 48 (“[T]he Colonists aforesaid are\ndeclared entitled to all Liberties, Privileges, and Immunities of Deni\nzens and natural Subjects, to all Intents and Purposes, as if they had\nbeen abiding and born within the Realm of England” (emphasis in\noriginal)).\n  5 See also Va.

See, e.g., 1 Annals\nof Cong. 431−432, 436–437, 440–442 (1834) (statement of\nRep. Madison) (proposing Bill of Rights in the first Con\ngress); The Federalist No. 84, pp. 531−533 (B. Wright ed.\n1961) (A. Hamilton); see also Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 19) (“[I]t has always been widely understood that\nthe Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amend\nments, codified a pre-existing right”). The Court’s subse\nquent decision in Barron, however, made plain that the\ncodification of these rights in the Bill made them legally\nenforceable only against the Federal Government, not the\nStates. See 7 Pet., at 247.\n                              3\n   Even though the Bill of Rights did not apply to the\nStates, other provisions of the Constitution did limit state\ninterference with individual rights. Article IV, §2, cl. 1\nprovides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several\nStates.” The text of this provision resembles the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, and it can be assumed that\nthe public’s understanding of the latter was informed by\nits understanding of the former.\n   Article IV, §2 was derived from a similar clause in the\nArticles of Confederation, and reflects the dual citizenship\nthe Constitution provided to all Americans after replacing\nthat “league” of separate sovereign States. Gibbons v.\nOgden, 9 Wheat. 1, 187 (1824); see 3 J. Story, Commentar\nies on the Constitution of the United States §1800, p. 675\n(1833). By virtue of a person’s citizenship in a particular\nState, he was guaranteed whatever rights and liberties\nthat State’s constitution and laws made available. Article\nIV, §2 vested citizens of each State with an additional\n\f16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nright: the assurance that they would be afforded the\n“privileges and immunities” of citizenship in any of the\nseveral States in the Union to which they might travel.\n   What were the “Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in\nthe several States”? That question was answered perhaps\nmost famously by Justice Bushrod Washington sitting as\nCircuit Justice in Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546,\n551−552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1825). In that case, a\nPennsylvania citizen claimed that a New Jersey law pro\nhibiting nonresidents from harvesting oysters from the\nState’s waters violated Article IV, §2 because it deprived\nhim, as an out-of-state citizen, of a right New Jersey\navailed to its own citizens. Id., at 550. Justice Washing\nton rejected that argument, refusing to “accede to the\nproposition” that Article IV, §2 entitled “citizens of the\nseveral states . . . to participate in all the rights which\nbelong exclusively to the citizens of any other particular\nstate.” Id., at 552 (emphasis added). In his view, Article\nIV, §2 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits\na State might choose to make available to its citizens. See\nid., at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights “which\nare, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right,\nto the citizens of all free governments.” Id., at 551 (em\nphasis added). Other courts generally agreed with this\nprinciple. See, e.g., Abbott v. Bayley, 23 Mass. 89, 92–93\n(1827) (noting that the “privileges and immunities” of\ncitizens in the several States protected by Article IV, §2\nare “qualified and not absolute” because they do not grant\na traveling citizen the right of “suffrage or of eligibility to\noffice” in the State to which he travels).\n   When describing those “fundamental” rights, Justice\nWashington thought it “would perhaps be more tedious\nthan difficult to enumerate” them all, but suggested that\nthey could “be all comprehended under” a broad list of\n“general heads,” such as “[p]rotection by the government,”\n“the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the right to acquire\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

On this question, the weight of\nlegal authorities at the time of Reconstruction indicated\nthat Article IV, §2 prohibited States from discriminating\nagainst sojourning citizens when recognizing fundamental\nrights, but did not require States to recognize those rights\nand did not prescribe their content. The highest courts of\nseveral States adopted this view, see, e.g., Livingston v.\nVan Ingen, 9 Johns. 507, 561 (N. Y. Sup. Ct. 1812) (Yates,\nJ.); id., at 577 (Kent, J.); Campbell v.

Cooley, A Treatise\n——————\n   6 Justice Washington’s complete list was as follows:\n\n“Protection by the government; the enjoyment of life and liberty, with\nthe right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue\nand obtain happiness and safety; subject nevertheless to such re\nstraints as the government may justly prescribe for the general good of\nthe whole. The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to\nreside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional\npursuits, or otherwise; to claim the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus;\nto institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the state;\nto take, hold and dispose of property, either real or personal; and an\nexemption from higher taxes or impositions than are paid by the other\ncitizens of the state; may be mentioned as some of the particular\nprivileges and immunities of citizens, which are clearly embraced by\nthe general description of privileges deemed to be fundamental: to\nwhich may be added, the elective franchise, as regulated and estab\nlished by the laws or constitution of the state in which it is to be exer\ncised.” 6 Fed.

Kent, Commentaries on American Law 35\n(11th ed. 1867) (stating that Article IV, §2 entitles sojourn\ning citizens “to the privileges that persons of the same\ndescription are entitled to in the state to which the re\nmoval is made, and to none other”). This Court adopted\nthe same conclusion in a unanimous opinion just one year\nafter the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Paul\nv. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869).\n                         *    *     *\n  The text examined so far demonstrates three points\nabout the meaning of the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nin §1. First, “privileges” and “immunities” were synonyms\nfor “rights.” Second, both the States and the Federal\nGovernment had long recognized the inalienable rights of\ntheir citizens. Third, Article IV, §2 of the Constitution\nprotected traveling citizens against state discrimination\nwith respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.\n  Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual\nsimilarity between §1’s Privileges or Immunities Clause\nand Article IV, §2. The first involves the nature of the\nrights at stake: Are the privileges or immunities of “citi\nzens of the United States” recognized by §1 the same as\nthe privileges and immunities of “citizens in the several\nStates” to which Article IV, §2 refers? The second involves\nthe restriction imposed on the States: Does §1, like Article\nIV, §2, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain\nrights if the State chooses to recognize them, or does it\nrequire States to recognize those rights? I address each\nquestion in turn.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

Section 1 overruled Dred\nScott’s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the\nUnited States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy\n“the privileges and immunities of citizens” embodied in the\nConstitution. 19 How., at 417. The Court in Dred Scott\ndid not distinguish between privileges and immunities of\ncitizens of the United States and citizens in the several\nStates, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.\nIt did, however, give examples of what the rights of citi\nzens were—the constitutionally enumerated rights of “the\nfull liberty of speech” and the right “to keep and carry\narms.” Ibid.\n   Section 1 protects the rights of citizens “of the United\nStates” specifically. The evidence overwhelmingly demon\nstrates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens\nincluded individual rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nincluding the right to keep and bear arms.\n                              1\n  Nineteenth-century treaties through which the United\nStates acquired territory from other sovereigns routinely\npromised inhabitants of the newly acquired territories\nthat they would enjoy all of the “rights,” “privileges,” and\n“immunities” of United States citizens. See, e.g., Treaty of\nAmity, Settlement, and Limits, Art. 6, Feb. 22, 1819, 8\nStat. 256−258, T. S. No. 327 (entered into force Feb. 19,\n1821) (cession of Florida) (“The inhabitants of the territo\nries which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States,\nby this Treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the\nUnited States, as soon as may be consistent with the\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the\nenjoyment of all the privileges, rights, and immunities, of\n\f20                      MCDONALD v.

It\nis therefore altogether unsurprising that several of these\ntreaties identify liberties enumerated in the Constitution\nas privileges and immunities common to all United States\ncitizens.\n   For example, the Louisiana Cession Act of 1803, which\ncodified a treaty between the United States and France\nculminating in the Louisiana Purchase, provided that\n     “The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incor\n     porated in the Union of the United States, and admit\n     ted as soon as possible, according to the principles of\n     the Federal constitution, to the enjoyments of all the\n     rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the\n     United States; and in the mean time they shall be\n     maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\n     their liberty, property and the religion which they pro\n     fess.” Treaty Between the United States of America\n——————\n  7 See  also Treaty Between the United States of America and the Ot\ntawa Indians of Blanchard’s Fork and Roche De Boeuf, June 24, 1862,\n12 Stat. 1237 (“The Ottawa Indians of the United Bands of Blanchard’s\nFork and of Roche de Boeuf, having become sufficiently advanced in\ncivilization, and being desirous of becoming citizens of the United\nStates . . .

In 1820, when the Missouri Terri\ntory (which the United States acquired through the Ces\nsion Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a\ndebate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within\nMissouri as a condition of its admission. Some congress\nmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would\ndeprive its inhabitants of the “privileges and immunities”\nthey had been promised by the Cession Act. See, e.g., 35\nAnnals of Cong. 1083 (1855) (remarks of Kentucky Rep.\nHardin). But those who opposed slavery in Missouri\nargued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter\nof state property law, not one of the privileges and immu\nnities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.9\n——————\n   8 Subsequent treaties contained similar guarantees that the inhabi\n\ntants of the newly acquired territories would enjoy the freedom to\nexercise certain constitutional rights.

CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   Daniel Webster was among the leading proponents of\nthe antislavery position. In his “Memorial to Congress,”\nWebster argued that “[t]he rights, advantages and immu\nnities here spoken of [in the Cession Act] must . . . be such\nas are recognized or communicated by the Constitution of\nthe United States,” not the “rights, advantages and im\nmunities, derived exclusively from the State governments\n. . . .” D. Webster, A Memorial to the Congress of the\nUnited States on the Subject of Restraining the Increase of\nSlavery in New States to be Admitted into the Union 15\n(Dec. 15, 1819) (emphasis added). “The obvious meaning”\nof the Act, in Webster’s view, was that “the rights derived\nunder the federal Constitution shall be enjoyed by the\ninhabitants of [the territory].” Id., at 15–16 (emphasis\nadded). In other words, Webster articulated a distinction\nbetween the rights of United States citizenship and the\nrights of state citizenship, and argued that the former\nincluded those rights “recognized or communicated by the\nConstitution.” Since the right to hold slaves was not\nmentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal\ncitizenship.\n   Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over\nslavery in Missouri and the territory was admitted as a\nslave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compro\nmise. Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820, ch. 22, §8,\n3 Stat. 548. But their arguments continued to inform\npublic understanding of the privileges and immunities of\n——————\ntion in the House of the Representatives 16 (1820), as published in\npamphlet form and reprinted in 22 Moore Pamphlets, p. 16 (“If the\nright to hold slaves is a federal right and attached merely to citizenship\nof the United States, [then slavery] could maintain itself against state\nauthority, and on this principle the owner might take his slaves into\nany state he pleased, in defiance of the state laws, but this would be\ncontrary to the constitution”); see also Lash, The Origins of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, Part I: “Privileges and Immunities” as an\nAntebellum Term of Art, 98 Geo.

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued a\nproclamation granting amnesty to former Confederates,\nguaranteeing “to all and to every person who directly or\nindirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion,\na full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason . . .\nwith restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities\nunder the Constitution and the laws which have been\nmade in pursuance thereof.” 15 Stat. 712.\n  Records from the 39th Congress further support this\nunderstanding.\n                            a\n  After the Civil War, Congress established the Joint\nCommittee on Reconstruction to investigate circumstances\nin the Southern States and to determine whether, and on\nwhat conditions, those States should be readmitted to the\n\f24                 MCDONALD v.

That Committee\nwould ultimately recommend the adoption of the Four\nteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by\nsubmitting a report to Congress that extensively cata\nlogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States\nand argued that “adequate security for future peace and\nsafety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic\nlaw as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all\ncitizens in all parts of the republic.” See Report of the\nJoint Committee on Reconstruction, S.

In\naddition, newspaper coverage suggests that the wider\npublic was aware of the Committee’s work even before the\nReport was issued. For example, the Fort Wayne Daily\nDemocrat (which appears to have been unsupportive of the\nCommittee’s work) paraphrased a motion instructing the\nCommittee to\n     “enquire into [the] expediency of amending the Con\n     stitution of the United States so as to declare with\n     greater certainty the power of Congress to enforce and\n     determine by appropriate legislation all the guaran\n     tees contained in that instrument.” The Nigger Con\n     gress!, Fort Wayne Daily Democrat, Feb. 1, 1866, p. 4\n     (emphasis added).\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Before considering that record here, it is\nimportant to clarify its relevance. When interpreting\nconstitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely\npublic understanding of a particular provision at the time\nit was adopted. Statements by legislators can assist in\nthis process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in\nwhich the public used or understood a particular word or\nphrase. They can further assist to the extent there is\nevidence that these statements were disseminated to the\npublic. In other words, this evidence is useful not because\nit demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have\nbeen thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the\npublic understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to\nmean.\n                             (1)\n  Three speeches stand out as particularly significant.\nRepresentative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of\n§1, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in Febru\nary 1866 introducing his first draft of the provision. Bing\nham began by discussing Barron and its holding that the\nBill of Rights did not apply to the States. He then argued\nthat a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide\n“an express grant of power in Congress to enforce by penal\nenactment these great canons of the supreme law, secur\n\f26                    MCDONALD v.

Globe 1089–1090 (1866).\nBingham emphasized that §1 was designed “to arm the\nCongress of the United States, by the consent of the people\nof the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of\nrights as it stands in the Constitution today. It ‘hath that\nextent—no more.’ ” Id., at 1088.\n    Bingham’s speech was printed in pamphlet form and\nbroadly distributed in 1866 under the title, “One Country,\nOne Constitution, and One People,” and the subtitle, “In\nSupport of the Proposed Amendment to Enforce the Bill of\nRights.”10 Newspapers also reported his proposal, with\nthe New York Times providing particularly extensive\ncoverage, including a full reproduction of Bingham’s first\ndraft of §1 and his remarks that a constitutional amend\nment to “enforc[e]” the “immortal bill of rights” was “abso\nlutely essential to American nationality.” N. Y. Times,\nFeb. 27, 1866, p. 8.\n    Bingham’s first draft of §1 was different from the ver\nsion ultimately adopted. Of particular importance, the\nfirst draft granted Congress the “power to make all laws\n. . . necessary and proper to secure” the “citizens of each\nState all privileges and immunities of citizens in the sev\neral States,” rather than restricting state power to\n“abridge” the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\nUnited States.11 39th Cong.

The pamphlet was published by the official\nreporter of congressional debates, and was distributed presumably\npursuant to the congressional franking privilege. See B.

A front-page article hailed the “Clear\nand Forcible Speech” by Representative Robert Hale\nagainst the draft, explaining—and endorsing—Hale’s view\nthat Bingham’s proposal would “confer upon Congress all\nthe rights and power of legislation now reserved to the\nStates” and would “in effect utterly obliterate State rights\nand State authority over their own internal affairs.”12\nN. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1.\n   Critically, Hale did not object to the draft insofar as it\npurported to protect constitutional liberties against state\ninterference. Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incor\nrectly in light of Barron) that individual rights enumer\nated in the Constitution were already enforceable against\nthe States. See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (“I have, somehow\nor other, gone along with the impression that there is that\nsort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether\nwith or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we\nare so protected”); see N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, at 1.\nHale’s misperception was not uncommon among members\nof the Reconstruction generation. See infra, at 38–40. But\nthat is secondary to the point that the Times’ coverage of\n\n——————\n“The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be neces\nsary and proper to secure to the citizens of each State all privileges and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the\nseveral States equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and prop\nerty.” 39th Cong. Globe 1088.\n   12 In a separate front-page article on the same day, the paper ex\n\npounded upon Hale’s arguments in even further detail, while omitting\nBingham’s chief rebuttals. N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1. The\nunbalanced nature of The New York Times’ coverage is unsurprising.\nAs scholars have noted, “[m]ost papers” during the time of Reconstruc\ntion “had a frank partisan slant . . . and the Times was no exception.”\nWildenthal 1559. In 1866, the paper “was still defending” President\nJohnson’s resistance to Republican reform measures, as exemplified by\nthe fact that it “supported Johnson’s veto of the Civil Rights Act of\n1866.” Ibid.\n\f28                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthis debate over §1’s meaning suggests public awareness\nof its main contours—i.e., that §1 would, at a minimum,\nenforce constitutionally enumerated rights of United\nStates citizens against the States.\n  Bingham’s draft was tabled for several months. In the\ninterim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech,\nagain arguing that a constitutional amendment was re\nquired to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of\nRights against the States. That speech was printed in\npamphlet form, see Speech of Hon. John A. Bingham, of\nOhio, on the Civil Rights Bill, Mar. 9, 1866 (Cong. Globe);\nsee 39th Cong. Globe 1837 (remarks of Rep. Lawrence)\n(noting that the speech was “extensively published”), and\nthe New York Times covered the speech on its front page.\nThirty-Ninth Congress, N. Y. Times, Mar. 10, 1866, p. 1.\n  By the time the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment\nresumed, Bingham had amended his draft of §1 to include\nthe text of the Privileges or Immunities Clause that was\nultimately adopted. Senator Jacob Howard introduced the\nnew draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech\nrelevant here. Howard explained that the Constitution\nrecognized “a mass of privileges, immunities, and rights,\nsome of them secured by the second section of the fourth\narticle of the Constitution, . . . some by the first eight\namendments of the Constitution,” and that “there is no\npower given in the Constitution to enforce and to carry out\nany of these guarantees” against the States. 39th Cong.\nGlobe 2765. Howard then stated that “the great object” of\n§1 was to “restrain the power of the States and compel\nthem at all times to respect these great fundamental\nguarantees.” Id., at 2766. Section 1, he indicated, im\nposed “a general prohibition upon all the States, as such,\nfrom abridging the privileges and immunities of the citi\nzens of the United States.” Id., at 2765.\n  In describing these rights, Howard explained that they\nincluded “the privileges and immunities spoken of” in\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Although he did not catalogue\nthe precise “nature” or “extent” of those rights, he thought\n“Corfield v. Coryell” provided a useful description. How\nard then submitted that\n     “[t]o these privileges and immunities, whatever they\n     may be— . . . should be added the personal rights gua\n     rantied and secured by the first eight amendments of\n     the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of\n     the press; the right of the people peaceably to assem\n     ble and petition the Government for a redress of\n     grievances, [and] . . . the right to keep and to bear\n     arms.” Ibid. (emphasis added).\n  News of Howard’s speech was carried in major newspa\npers across the country, including the New York Herald,\nsee N. Y. Herald, May 24, 1866, p. 1, which was the best\nselling paper in the Nation at that time, see A. Amar, The\nBill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction 187 (1998)\n(hereinafter Amar).13 The New York Times carried the\nspeech as well, reprinting a lengthy excerpt of Howard’s\nremarks, including the statements quoted above. N. Y.\nTimes, May 24, 1866, p. 1. The following day’s Times\neditorialized on Howard’s speech, predicting that “[t]o this,\nthe first section of the amendment, the Union party\nthroughout the country will yield a ready acquiescence,\nand the South could offer no justifiable resistance,” sug\ngesting that Bingham’s narrower second draft had not\nbeen met with the same objections that Hale had raised\nagainst the first.

CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that\n§1 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared\nrights against the States, and they provide no suggestion\nthat any language in the section other than the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.\n                              (2)\n   When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legis\nlation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further sup\nports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amend\nment—which outlawed slavery alone—and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of\nlegislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\nwhich provided that “all persons born in the United\nStates” were “citizens of the United States” and that “such\ncitizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same\nright” to, among other things, “full and equal benefit of all\nlaws and proceedings for the security of person and prop\nerty, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Ch. 31, §1, 14 Stat.\n27.\n   Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it\nas providing the “privileges” of citizenship to freedmen,\nand defined those privileges to include constitutional\nrights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th\nCong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that\nthe “the late slaveholding States” had enacted laws “de\npriving persons of African descent of privileges which are\nessential to freemen,” including “prohibit[ing] any negro or\nmulatto from having fire-arms” and stating that “[t]he\npurpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all\nthese discriminations”); id., at 1266–1267 (remarks of Rep.\nRaymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to\n“[m]ake a colored man a citizen of the United States”\nwould guarantee to him, inter alia, “a defined status . . . a\nright to defend himself and his wife and children; a right\nto bear arms”).\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  Three months later, Congress passed the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, which also entitled all citizens to the “full and\nequal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning per\nsonal liberty” and “personal security.” Act of July 16,\n1866, ch. 200, §14, 14 Stat. 176. The Act stated expressly\nthat the rights of personal liberty and security protected\nby the Act “includ[ed] the constitutional right to bear\narms.” Ibid.\n                              (3)\n   There is much else in the legislative record. Many\nstatements by Members of Congress corroborate the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced consti\ntutionally enumerated rights against the States. See\nCurtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any\nstatement that directly refutes that proposition. That\nsaid, the record of the debates—like most legislative his\ntory—is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambi\nguity derives from the fact that at least several Members\ndescribed §1 as protecting the privileges and immunities\nof citizens “in the several States,” harkening back to Arti\ncle IV, §2. See supra, at 28–29 (describing Sen. Howard’s\nspeech). These statements can be read to support the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or\nall the fundamental rights of “citizens” described in Cor\nfield. They can also be read to support the view that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, §2, pro\nhibits only state discrimination with respect to those\nrights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to\ndeny those rights to all citizens equally.\n   I examine the rest of the historical record with this\nunderstanding. But for purposes of discerning what the\npublic most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities\nClause to mean, it is significant that the most widely\npublicized statements by the legislators who voted on §1—\nBingham, Howard, and even Hale—point unambiguously\n\f32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntoward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause enforces at least those fundamental rights enu\nmerated in the Constitution against the States, including\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n                               3\n   Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the\nperiod immediately following its ratification help to estab\nlish the public understanding of the text at the time of its\nadoption.\n   Some of these interpretations come from Members of\nCongress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes\nlisted the Constitution’s first eight Amendments, includ\ning “the right to keep and bear arms,” before explaining\nthat after the Civil War, the country “gave the most grand\nof all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one\nsingle amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of\nAmerican citizens” who formerly were slaves. Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475–476 (1871). “It is all\nthese,” Dawes explained, “which are comprehended in the\nwords ‘American citizen.’ ” Ibid.; see also id., at 334 (re\nmarks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immu\nnities Clause referred to those rights “declared to belong to\nthe citizen by the Constitution itself”). Even opponents of\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowl\nedged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected\nconstitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2\nCong. Rec. 384–385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (oppos\ning enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to\nthe Bill of Rights, that “[t]hese first amendments and\nsome provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace\nthe ‘privileges and immunities’ of citizenship as set forth\nin article 4, section 2 of the Constitution and in the four\nteenth amendment” (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166–170\n(collecting examples).\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

For example, Congress enacted the Civil Rights\nAct of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, which was titled in pertinent part\n“An Act to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States,” and\nwhich is codified in the still-existing 42 U. S. C. §1983.\nThat statute prohibits state officials from depriving citi\nzens of “any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by\nthe Constitution.” Rev. Stat. 1979, 42 U. S. C. §1983 (em\nphasis added). Although the Judiciary ignored this provi\nsion for decades after its enactment, this Court has come\nto interpret the statute, unremarkably in light of its text,\nas protecting constitutionally enumerated rights. Monroe\nv. Pape, 365 U. S. 167, 171 (1961).\n   A Federal Court of Appeals decision written by a future\nJustice of this Court adopted the same understanding of\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause. See, e.g., United\nStates v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 79, 82 (No. 15,282) (CC SD Ala.\n1871) (Woods, J.) (“We think, therefore, that the . . . rights\nenumerated in the first eight articles of amendment to the\nconstitution of the United States, are the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens of the United States”). In addition,\ntwo of the era’s major constitutional treatises reflected the\nunderstanding that §1 would protect constitutionally\nenumerated rights from state abridgment.14 A third such\ntreatise unambiguously indicates that the Privileges or\n——————\n  14 See J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional Law of the\n\nUnited States 155–156 (E.

Corbin cited Barron and\ndeclared:\n     “[T]he fourteenth amendment changes all that theory,\n     and lays the same restriction upon the States that be\n     fore lay upon the Congress of the United States—that,\n     as Congress heretofore could not interfere with the\n     right of the citizen to keep and bear arms, now, after\n     the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, the State\n     cannot interfere with the right of the citizen to keep\n     and bear arms. The right to keep and bear arms is in\n     cluded in the fourteenth amendment, under ‘privi\n     leges and immunities.’ ” Proceedings in the Ku Klux\n     Trials at Columbia, S. C., in the United States Circuit\n     Court, November Term, 1871, p. 147 (1872).\n                       *    *     *\n  This evidence plainly shows that the ratifying public\nunderstood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to protect\nconstitutionally enumerated rights, including the right to\nkeep and bear arms. As the Court demonstrates, there\ncan be no doubt that §1 was understood to enforce the\nSecond Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22–\n33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear\narms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen\nship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

The municipal re\nspondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former\ninterpretation. They contend that the Second Amend\nment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth,\nauthorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun\npossession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State\napplies it to all citizens equally.15 The Court explains why\nthis antidiscrimination-only reading of §1 as a whole is\n“implausible.” Ante, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to\nthe States, I must explain why this Clause in particular\nprotects against more than just state discrimination, and\nin fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all\nAmerican citizens.\n                              1\n   I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immuni\nties Clause opens with the command that “No State shall”\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n——————\n   15 The municipal respondents and JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent raise a\n\nmost unusual argument that §1 prohibits discriminatory laws affecting\nonly the right to keep and bear arms, but offers substantive protection\nto other rights enumerated in the Constitution, such as the freedom of\nspeech. See post, at 24. Others, however, have made the more compre\nhensive—and internally consistent—argument that §1 bars discrimina\ntion alone and does not afford protection to any substantive rights. See,\ne.g., R. Berger, Government By Judiciary: The Transformation of the\nFourteenth Amendment (1997). I address the coverage of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause only as it applies to the Second Amendment\nright presented here, but I do so with the understanding that my\nconclusion may have implications for the broader argument.\n\f36                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nUnited States. Amdt. 14, §1 (emphasis added). The very\nsame phrase opens Article I, §10 of the Constitution,\nwhich prohibits the States from “pass[ing] any Bill of\nAttainder” or “ex post facto Law,” among other things.\nArticle I, §10 is one of the few constitutional provisions\nthat limits state authority. In Barron, when Chief Justice\nMarshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking “plain\nand intelligible language” restricting state power to in\nfringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, §10\nas an example of text that would have accomplished that\ntask. 7 Pet., at 250. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would\nlater describe Article I, §10 as “a bill of rights for the\npeople of each state.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138\n(1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause uses the command “[n]o State shall”—which Arti\ncle IV, §2 does not—strongly suggests that the former\nimposes a greater restriction on state power than the\nlatter.\n   This interpretation is strengthened when one considers\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb\n“abridge,” rather than “discriminate,” to describe the limit\nit imposes on state authority. The Webster’s dictionary in\nuse at the time of Reconstruction defines the word\n“abridge” to mean “[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to\nabridge one of his rights.” Webster, An American Diction\nary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best\nunderstood to impose a limitation on state power to in\nfringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no\nindication that the Framers of the Clause used the word\n“abridge” to prohibit only discrimination.\n   This most natural textual reading is underscored by a\nwell-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment\nthat the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several\nSouthern States refused to ratify the Amendment, Presi\ndent Johnson met with their Governors to draft a com\npromise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5. Their proposal\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Fleming ed. 1950)\n    (hereinafter Fleming).\n  Significantly, this proposal removed the “[n]o State\nshall” directive and the verb “abridge” from §1, and also\nchanged the class of rights to be protected from those\nbelonging to “citizens of the United States” to those of the\n“citizens in the several States.” This phrasing is materi\nally indistinguishable from Article IV, §2, which gener\nally was understood as an antidiscrimination provision\nalone. See supra, at 15–18. The proposal thus strongly\nindicates that at least the President of the United States\nand several southern Governors thought that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully\ntried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored\ndiscrimination.\n                              2\n  The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by\na claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of §1\ngenerally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argu\nment goes, §1 must not have been understood to accom\nplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal\nenforcement of a minimum baseline of rights.

It\nis true that the congressional debates over §1 were rela\ntively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of\nextensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures\ndid not keep records of their debates, and the few records\nthat do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis\n145. These facts are not surprising.\n   First, however consequential we consider the question\ntoday, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not\nthe most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend\nment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just\nendured a tumultuous civil war, and §§2, 3, and 4—which\nreduced the representation of States that denied voting\nrights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers\nof the power to hold elective office, and required States to\ndisavow Confederate war debts—were far more polarizing\nand consumed far more political attention. See Wilden\nthal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the\nFourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866–1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).\n   Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth\nAmendment reveal that many representatives, and proba\nbly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend\nment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina\ntion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights\nagainst the States. Justice Black’s dissent in Adamson\nchronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107–108\n(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether\nthat understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu\ntional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little\nto say during the debates about §1.

Like the Framers, see supra, at 14–15, many 19th\ncentury Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare\ninalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,\neven though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to\nthe Federal Government, many believed that it declared\nrights that no legitimate government could abridge.\n   Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin’s decision for the Georgia\nSupreme Court in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846), illus\ntrates this view. In assessing state power to regulate\nfirearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was “aware\nthat it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],\nlike other amendments adopted at the same time, is a\nrestriction upon the government of the United States, and\ndoes not extend to the individual States.” Id., at 250. But\nhe still considered the right to keep and bear arms as “an\nunalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free\ngovernment,” and thus found the States bound to honor it.\nIbid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with\nrespect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu\nmerated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the\nprotections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable\nagainst the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi\nnent treatise of the era took the same position.

S., at __\n(slip op., at 34) (describing Rawle’s treatise as “influen\ntial”). Certain abolitionist leaders adhered to this view as\nwell. Lysander Spooner championed the popular aboli\ntionist argument that slavery was inconsistent with con\nstitutional principles, citing as evidence the fact that it\ndeprived black Americans of the “natural right of all men\n‘to keep and bear arms’ for their personal defence,” which\nhe believed the Constitution “prohibit[ed] both Congress\nand the State governments from infringing.” L. Spooner,\nThe Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).\n   In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of\nRights did apply to the States, even though this Court had\nsquarely rejected that theory. See, e.g., supra, at 27–28\n(recounting Rep. Hale’s argument to this effect). Many\nothers believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of\nRights were ones that no State should abridge, even\nthough they understood that the Bill technically did not\napply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that\nmost state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the\nindividual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made\nthe need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties\nagainst the States an afterthought. See ante, at 29 (opin\nion of the Court) (noting that, “[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\nexplicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms”).\nThat changed with the national conflict over slavery.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

Congressman Tobias Plants explained that\nslaveholders “could not hold [slaves] safely where dissent\nwas permitted,” so they decided that “all dissent must be\nsuppressed by the strong hand of power.” 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1013. The measures they used were ruthless, re\npressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitu\ntion, and demonstrated that preventing only discrimina\ntory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow\nassurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the\nAmerican people understood this point.\n   The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress\nthe spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant\nrisk of a slave rebellion. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate\nthe extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slave\nholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures.\nSlaves and free blacks represented a substantial percent\nage of the population and posed a severe threat to South\nern order if they were not kept in their place. According to\nthe 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more\nof the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half\nthe population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisi\nana, and more than 50% of the population in Mississippi\nand South Carolina. Statistics of the United States (In\ncluding Mortality, Property, &c.,) in 1860, The Eighth\nCensus 336−350 (1866).\n   The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded.\nAlthough there were others, two particularly notable slave\nuprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In\n1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark\nVesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their\nmasters and flee to Haiti. H. Aptheker, American Negro\n\f42                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nSlave Revolts 268–270 (1983). The plan was foiled, lead\ning to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of\n37, including Vesey. Id., at 271. Still, slaveowners took\nnotice—it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to\n9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. Id.,\nat 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was real\nized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at\nleast 57 whites before it was suppressed. Id., at 300–302.\n  The fear generated by these and other rebellions led\nSouthern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at\nthe rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and\nbear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even\nthe Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in\nsome States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution:\nSlavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956). Vir\nginia made it a crime for a member of an “abolition” soci\nety to enter the State and argue “that the owners of slaves\nhave no property in the same, or advocate or advise the\nabolition of slavery.” 1835–1836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44.\nOther States prohibited the circulation of literature deny\ning a master’s right to property in his slaves and passed\nlaws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search\nof such material. C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought\nStruggle in the Old South 118–143, 199–200 (1964).\n  Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting\nslaves from carrying firearms18 to apply the prohibition to\nfree blacks as well. See, e.g., Act of Dec. 23, 1833, §7, 1833\nGa.

Ibid.\n   Southern blacks were not alone in facing threats to their\npersonal liberty and security during the antebellum era.\nMob violence in many Northern cities presented dangers\nas well.

As Representative\nThaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, “[w]hen it was\nfirst proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did\nnot half the nation tremble?

Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865–\n1877, p. 104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).\n   As the Court explains, this fear led to “systematic ef\nforts” in the “old Confederacy” to disarm the more than\n180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as\nwell as other free blacks. See ante, at 23. Some States\nformally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. Ante,\nat 23–24 (quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, §1, reprinted in\n1 Fleming 289). Others enacted legislation prohibiting\nblacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restric\ntion not imposed on whites. See, e.g., La. Statute of 1865,\nreprinted in id., at 280. Additionally, “[t]hroughout the\nSouth, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate\nsoldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms\nfrom newly freed slaves.” Ante, at 24.\n   As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth\nAmendment “had outlawed only those laws that discrimi\nnate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude,\nAfrican-Americans in the South would likely have re\nmained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abus\ners: the state militia and state peace officers.” Ante, at 32.\nIn the years following the Civil War, a law banning fire\narm possession outright “would have been nondiscrimina\ntory only in the formal sense,” for it would have “left fire\narms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.”\nIbid.\n   Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the\ntime the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The pub\nlicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see ante, at\n23–24 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens\nindicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a\nfederal solution to this problem, see, e.g., 39th Cong. Globe\n337 (remarks of Rep. Sumner) (introducing “a memorial\nfrom the colored citizens of the State of South Carolina”\nasking for, inter alia, “constitutional protection in keeping\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., Jan. 17, 1866, order from Major\nGeneral D. E. Sickles, reprinted in E. McPherson, The\nPolitical History of the United States of America During\nthe Period of Reconstruction 37 (1871) (“The constitutional\nrights of all loyal and well-disposed inhabitants to bear\narms will not be infringed”). The significance of these\nsteps was not lost on those they were designed to protect.\nAfter one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder,\npublished by the African Methodist Episcopal Church,\npublished the following editorial:\n       “ ‘We have several times alluded to the fact that the\n    Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every\n    citizen the right to keep and bear arms. . . . All men,\n    without the distinction of color, have the right to keep\n    arms to defend their homes, families, or themselves.’\n       “We are glad to learn that [the] Commissioner for\n    this State . . . has given freedmen to understand that\n    they have as good a right to keep fire arms as any\n    other citizens.

See, e.g., J. Tiffany, Treatise on the\nUnconstitutionality of American Slavery 56 (1849) (reprint\n1969) (“pledg[ing] . . . to see that all the rights, privileges,\nand immunities, granted by the constitution of the United\nStates, are extended to all”); id., at 99 (describing the\n“right to keep and bear arms” as one of those rights se\ncured by “the constitution of the United States”). The\nproblem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under\nDred Scott, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and\nthat, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state\nlaw recognized did not apply to blacks. See, e.g., Cooper v.\nSavannah, 4 Ga. 68, 72 (1848) (deciding, just two years\nafter Chief Justice Lumpkin’s opinion in Nunn recognizing\nthe right to keep and bear arms, see supra, at 39, that\n“[f]ree persons of color have never been recognized here as\ncitizens; they are not entitled to bear arms”).\n   Section 1 guaranteed the rights of citizenship in the\nUnited States and in the several States without regard to\nrace.

As Frederick Douglass explained before §1’s\nadoption, “the Legislatures of the South can take from him\nthe right to keep and bear arms, as they can—they would\nnot allow a negro to walk with a cane where I came from,\nthey would not allow five of them to assemble together.”\nIn What New Skin Will the Old Snake Come Forth?

McKivigan eds., 1991) (footnote\nomitted). “Notwithstanding the provision in the Constitu\ntion of the United States, that the right to keep and bear\narms shall not be abridged,” Douglass explained that “the\nblack man has never had the right either to keep or bear\narms.” Id., at 84. Absent a constitutional amendment to\nenforce that right against the States, he insisted that “the\nwork of the Abolitionists [wa]s not finished.” Ibid.\n   This history confirms what the text of the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause most naturally suggests: Consistent\nwith its command that “[n]o State shall . . . abridge” the\nrights of United States citizens, the Clause establishes a\nminimum baseline of federal rights, and the constitutional\nright to keep and bear arms plainly was among them.19\n                           III\n  My conclusion is contrary to this Court’s precedents,\nwhich hold that the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms is not a privilege of United States citizenship.\n——————\n  19 Iconclude that the right to keep and bear arms applies to the\nStates through the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which recognizes\nthe rights of United States “citizens.” The plurality concludes that the\nright applies to the States through the Due Process Clause, which\ncovers all “person[s].” Because this case does not involve a claim\nbrought by a noncitizen, I express no view on the difference, if any,\nbetween my conclusion and the plurality’s with respect to the extent to\nwhich the States may regulate firearm possession by noncitizens.\n\f48                     MCDONALD v.

I must,\ntherefore, consider whether stare decisis requires reten\ntion of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my\ninquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not\nendeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent,\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other\nrights enumerated in the Constitution against the\nStates.20 Nor do I suggest that the stare decisis considera\ntions surrounding the application of the right to keep and\nbear arms against the States would be the same as those\nsurrounding another right protected by the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause.

Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights\nprotect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (granting the “Privi\nlege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus”), and there is no obvious evidence\nthat the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to\nexclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent\nfederal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as\nprotecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth\nAmendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause, which “does not purport to protect individual\nrights.” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 50\n(2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment); see Amar 179–180.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court held that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of\nfederal citizenship—those “which owe their existence to\nthe Federal government, its National character, its Con\nstitution, or its laws,” id., at 79—and did not protect any\nof the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other\nwords, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually\nexclusive.\n   After separating these two sets of rights, the Court\ndefined the rights of state citizenship as “embrac[ing]\nnearly every civil right for the establishment and protec\ntion of which organized government is instituted”—that is,\nall those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer\nring to “those rights” that “Judge Washington” described).\nThat left very few rights of federal citizenship for the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court\nsuggested a handful of possibilities, such as the “right of\nfree access to [federal] seaports,” protection of the Federal\nGovernment while traveling “on the high seas,” and even\ntwo rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting\n“[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and “the privilege of\nthe writ of habeas corpus”); see supra, at 4. But its deci\nsion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship\nas mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to\nconclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were\nexcluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause’s scope.\nSee Cruikshank, supra.\n   I reject that understanding. There was no reason to\ninterpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting\nthe Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the “privi\nleges and immunities” of federal citizenship to mean ei\nther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights\nat all. 16 Wall., at 76.

If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were\nunderstood to protect every conceivable civil right from\nstate abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have\nbeen redundant.\n   The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov\nernment’s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable\nrights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to\nsay that the privileges and immunities of state and federal\ncitizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s ratification, States performed many more\nfunctions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely\nthat, simply by referring to “privileges or immunities,” the\nFramers of §1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in\nCorfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, “privi\nleges” and “immunities” were understood only as syno\nnyms for “rights.” See supra, at 9–11. It was their at\ntachment to a particular group that gave them content,\nand the text and history recounted here indicate that the\nrights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi\ncal to the rights of citizens “in the several States.” Justice\nSwayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made\nthe point clear:\n     “The citizen of a State has the same fundamental\n     rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer\n     tain others, local in their character, arising from his\n     relation to the State, and in addition, those which be\n     long to the citizen of the United States, he being in\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

There may thus be a double citi\n     zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It\n     is only over those which belong to the citizen of the\n     United States that the category here in question\n     throws the shield of its protection.” 16 Wall., at 126\n     (emphasis added).\nBecause the privileges and immunities of American citi\nzenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nthey overlap to at least some extent with the privileges\nand immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the\nseveral States.\n  A separate question is whether the privileges and im\nmunities of American citizenship include any rights be\nsides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four\ndissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the\nunenumerated right that the butchers in that case as\nserted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111\n(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent\ning). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated\nright, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether\nthe Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court’s\njudgment in Slaughter-House was correct.\n  Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer\nated rights against the States creates “ ‘special hazards’ ”\nthat should prevent this Court from returning to the\noriginal meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the\n\n——————\n   21 To the extent JUSTICE STEVENS is concerned that reliance on the\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may invite judges to “write their\npersonal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution,” post,\nat 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), his celebration of the alterna\ntive—the “flexibility,” “transcend[ence],” and “dynamism” of substan\ntive due process—speaks for itself, post, at 14–15, 20.\n\f52                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt’s substantive due process jurisprudence, which\nillustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to\nrecognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of\ntextual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to\nassume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im\nmunities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not\nexpressly list the rights it protects does not render it\nincapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu\ntion contains many provisions that require an examination\nof more than just constitutional text to determine whether\na particular act is within Congress’ power or is otherwise\nprohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, §8, cl. 18 (Necessary and\nProper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying\nera understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to\nmean, interpreting it should be no more “hazardous” than\ninterpreting these other constitutional provisions by using\nthe same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But\nthey will have the advantage of being questions the Con\nstitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are\nmore worthy of this Court’s attention—and far more likely\nto yield discernable answers—than the substantive due\nprocess questions the Court has for years created on its\nown, with neither textual nor historical support.\n   Finding these impediments to returning to the original\nmeaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it\nprecludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the\nstare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent\nthat expressly controls the question presented here.\n                            B\n  Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik\nshank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

Cruik\nshank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws\nin its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities\nClause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its\noriginal meaning, and I would reject the holding on that\nbasis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant\nmention as well.\n   Cruikshank’s holding that blacks could look only to state\ngovernments for protection of their right to keep and bear\narms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of\nlocal governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and\ntheir descendants through a wave of private violence\ndesigned to drive blacks from the voting booth and force\nthem into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without\nfederal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and\nbear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc\ncessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very\npeople the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.\n   Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.\nThere, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a\ntroop of black militiamen for no other reason than that\nthey had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July\nparade through their mostly black town. The white mili\ntia commander, “Pitchfork” Ben Tillman, later described\nthis massacre with pride: “[T]he leading white men of\nEdgefield” had decided “to seize the first opportunity that\nthe negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach\nthe negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate\ntheir superiority by killing as many of them as was justifi\nable.” S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman & the Reconstruction of\nWhite Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). None of the perpetrators of\nthe Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.22\n——————\n 22 Tillman   went on to a long career as South Carolina’s Governor and,\n\f54                      MCDONALD v.

Militias such as the\nKu Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the\nWhite Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the ’76 Associa\ntion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by\nbreaking up Republican meetings, threatening political\nleaders, and whipping black militiamen.

But at\nother times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob\nviolence to survive.

The record\nmakes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary\nto include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the\nwake of the War over slavery.

The principal opinion’s lengthy\nsummary of our “incorporation” doctrine, see ante, at 5–9,\n11–19 (majority opinion), 10–11 (plurality opinion), and its\nimplicit (and untenable) effort to wall off that doctrine\nfrom the rest of our substantive due process jurisprudence,\ninvite a fresh survey of this old terrain.\nSubstantive Content\n  The first, and most basic, principle established by our\ncases is that the rights protected by the Due Process\nClause are not merely procedural in nature.

For it is the liberty clause of the Four­\nteenth Amendment that grounds our most important\nholdings in this field. It is the liberty clause that enacts\nthe Constitution’s “promise” that a measure of dignity and\nself-rule will be afforded to all persons. Planned Parent­\nhood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 847\n(1992). It is the liberty clause that reflects and renews\n“the origins of the American heritage of freedom [and] the\nabiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain\nstate intrusions on the citizen’s right to decide how he will\nlive his own life intolerable.” Fitzgerald v. Porter Memo­\nrial Hospital, 523 F. 2d 716, 720 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.).\nOur substantive due process cases have episodically in­\nvoked values such as privacy and equality as well, values\nthat in certain contexts may intersect with or complement\na subject’s liberty interests in profound ways. But as I\nhave observed on numerous occasions, “most of the signifi­\ncant [20th-century] cases raising Bill of Rights issues\nhave, in the final analysis, actually interpreted the word\n‘liberty’ in the Fourteenth Amendment.”8\n   It follows that the term “incorporation,” like the term\n“unenumerated rights,” is something of a misnomer.\n——————\n  8 Stevens, The Bill of Rights: A Century of Progress, 59 U.

S.,\nat 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring). As the second Justice\nHarlan has shown, ever since the Court began considering\nthe applicability of the Bill of Rights to the States, “the\nCourt’s usual approach has been to ground the prohibi­\ntions against state action squarely on due process, without\nintermediate reliance on any of the first eight Amend­\nments.” Malloy v.

L. Rev.\n746, 747–750 (1965). In the pathmarking case of Gitlow v.\nNew York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925), for example, both the\nmajority and dissent evaluated petitioner’s free speech\nclaim not under the First Amendment but as an aspect of\n“the fundamental personal rights and ‘liberties’ protected\nby the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nfrom impairment by the States.”9\n——————\n  9 See also Gitlow, 268 U. S., at 672 (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The\n\ngeneral principle of free speech, it seems to me, must be taken to be\nincluded in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has\nbeen given to the word ‘liberty’ as there used, although perhaps it may\nbe accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is\nallowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to\ngovern the laws of the United States”). Subsequent decisions repeat­\nedly reaffirmed that persons hold free speech rights against the States\non account of the Fourteenth Amendment’s liberty clause, not the First\nAmendment per se. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357\nU. S. 449, 460, 466 (1958); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303\n(1940); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.

S., at 500\n(concurring in judgment), Justice Harlan memorably\ndistilled these precedents’ lesson: “While the relevant\ninquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provi­\nsions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or\nany of their radiations. The Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment stands . . . on its own bottom.”10\nInclusion in the Bill of Rights is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for an interest to be judicially enforceable under\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. This Court’s “ ‘selective\nincorporation’ ” doctrine, ante, at 15, is not simply “related”\nto substantive due process, ante, at 19; it is a subset\nthereof.\nFederal/State Divergence\n  The third precept to emerge from our case law flows from\nthe second: The rights protected against state infringement\nby the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause need\nnot be identical in shape or scope to the rights protected\nagainst Federal Government infringement by the various\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights. As drafted, the Bill of\n——————\nsame basic approach to “incorporation,” with the Fourteenth Amend­\nment taken as a distinct source of rights independent from the first\neight Amendments. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 322–328\n(1937) (opinion for the Court by Cardozo, J.); Adamson v. California,\n332 U. S. 46, 59–68 (1947) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).\n   10 See also Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.

The issue is closed”). Wolf’s holding on the exclusionary\nrule was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), but the\nprinciple just quoted has never been disturbed. It is notable that\nMapp, the case that launched the modern “doctrine of ad hoc,” “ ‘jot-for­\njot’ ” incorporation, Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 130–131 (1970)\n(Harlan, J., concurring in result), expressly held “that the exclusionary\nrule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend­\nments.” 367 U.

CHICAGO\n\n                       STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nRights directly constrained only the Federal Government.\nSee Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet.\n243 (1833). Although the enactment of the Fourteenth\nAmendment profoundly altered our legal order, it “did not\nunstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our consti­\ntutional fabric.” Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 133\n(1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result). Nor, for that\nmatter, did it expressly alter the Bill of Rights. The Con­\nstitution still envisions a system of divided sovereignty,\nstill “establishes a federal republic where local differences\nare to be cherished as elements of liberty” in the vast run\nof cases, National Rifle Assn. of Am. Inc. v. Chicago, 567\nF. 3d 856, 860 (CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C. J.), still allo­\ncates a general “police power . . . to the States and the\nStates alone,” United States v. Comstock, 560 U. S. ___, ___\n(2010) (slip op., at 4) (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judg­\nment). Elementary considerations of constitutional text\nand structure suggest there may be legitimate reasons to\nhold state governments to different standards than the\nFederal Government in certain areas.11\n   It is true, as the Court emphasizes, ante, at 15–19, that\nwe have made numerous provisions of the Bill of Rights\nfully applicable to the States. It is settled, for instance,\nthat the Governor of Alabama has no more power than the\nPresident of the United States to authorize unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23\n(1963). But we have never accepted a “total incorporation”\ntheory of the Fourteenth Amendment, whereby the\nAmendment is deemed to subsume the provisions of the\nBill of Rights en masse.

S. 211 (1916) (Seventh Amendment);\nHurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516 (1884) (Grand Jury\nClause). We have, moreover, resisted a uniform approach\nto the Sixth Amendment’s criminal jury guarantee, de­\nmanding 12-member panels and unanimous verdicts in\nfederal trials, yet not in state trials. See Apodaca v. Ore­\ngon, 406 U. S. 404 (1972) (plurality opinion); Williams, 399\nU. S. 78. In recent years, the Court has repeatedly de­\nclined to grant certiorari to review that disparity.12 While\nthose denials have no precedential significance, they\nconfirm the proposition that the “incorporation” of a provi­\nsion of the Bill of Rights into the Fourteenth Amendment\ndoes not, in itself, mean the provision must have precisely\nthe same meaning in both contexts.\n   It is true, as well, that during the 1960’s the Court\ndecided a number of cases involving procedural rights in\nwhich it treated the Due Process Clause as if it trans­\nplanted language from the Bill of Rights into the Four­\nteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Benton v. Maryland, 395\nU. S. 784, 795 (1969) (Double Jeopardy Clause); Pointer v.\nTexas, 380 U. S. 400, 406 (1965) (Confrontation Clause).\n“Jot-for-jot” incorporation was the norm in this expansion­\nary era. Yet at least one subsequent opinion suggests that\nthese precedents require perfect state/federal congruence\nonly on matters “ ‘at the core’ ” of the relevant constitutional\nguarantee. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U. S. 28, 37 (1978); see also\nid., at 52–53 (Powell, J., dissenting).

CHICAGO\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfairness, some procedures should be the same in state and\nfederal courts: The need for certainty and uniformity is\nmore pressing, and the margin for error slimmer, when\ncriminal justice is at issue. That principle has little rele­\nvance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set\nforth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib­\nerty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378\nU. S., at 10–11, it is therefore an overstatement to say\nthat the Court has “abandoned,” ante, at 16, 17 (majority\nopinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a “two-track approach to\nincorporation,” ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court\nmoved away from that approach in the area of criminal\nprocedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda­\nmental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill\nof Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some\n1960’s opinions purported to establish a general method of\nincorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court\nhas not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court\nexcesses in more areas than I can count.\n   I do not mean to deny that there can be significant\npractical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights\nsymmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov­\nernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may\nentail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore\ngreater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora­\ntion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of\nthe legal rule. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U. S. 356,\n384–388 (1972) (Douglas, J., dissenting); Pointer, 380\nU. S., at 413–414 (Goldberg, J., concurring). In a federal­\nist system such as ours, however, this approach can carry\nsubstantial costs. When a federal court insists that state\nand local authorities follow its dictates on a matter not\ncritical to personal liberty or procedural justice, the latter\nmay be prevented from engaging in the kind of beneficent\n“experimentation in things social and economic” that\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

S. 262, 311 (1932)\n(Brandeis, J., dissenting). The costs of federal courts’\nimposing a uniform national standard may be especially\nhigh when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi­\ncantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the\nStates’ core police powers.\n  Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the\nStates, federal courts will cause those provisions to “be\nwatered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.”\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 182, n. 21 (1968)\n(Harlan, J., dissenting). When one legal standard must\nprevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs\nand customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan­\ndard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when\nwe move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure\nand into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.\nSo long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are\nalways and everywhere respected, it is not clear that\ngreater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a\nprovision of the Bill of Rights to the States. Indeed, it is\nfar from clear that proponents of an individual right to\nkeep and bear arms ought to celebrate today’s decision.13\n——————\n   13 The vast majority of States already recognize a right to keep and\n\nbear arms in their own constitutions, see Volokh, State Constitutional\nRights to Keep and Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191 (2006)\n(cataloguing provisions); Brief for Petitioners 69 (observing that\n“[t]hese Second Amendment analogs are effective and consequential”),\nbut the States vary widely in their regulatory schemes, their traditions\nand cultures of firearm use, and their problems relating to gun vio­\nlence. If federal and state courts must harmonize their review of gun­\ncontrol laws under the Second Amendment, the resulting jurisprudence\nmay prove significantly more deferential to those laws than the status\nquo ante. Once it has been established that a single legal standard\nmust govern nationwide, federal courts will face a profound pressure to\nreconcile that standard with the diverse interests of the States and\n\f14                     MCDONALD v.

How should a court go about the\nanalysis, then? Our precedents have established, not an\nexact methodology, but rather a framework for decision­\nmaking. In this respect, too, the Court’s narrative fails to\ncapture the continuity and flexibility in our doctrine.\n   The basic inquiry was described by Justice Cardozo\nmore than 70 years ago. When confronted with a substan­\ntive due process claim, we must ask whether the allegedly\nunlawful practice violates values “implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.” Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319,\n325 (1937).14 If the practice in question lacks any “oppres­\nsive and arbitrary” character, if judicial enforcement of the\nasserted right would not materially contribute to “a fair\nand enlightened system of justice,” then the claim is un­\n—————— \n\ntheir long history of regulating in this sensitive area. Cf. Williams, 399 \n\nU. S., at 129–130 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (noting “ ‘backlash’ ”\npotential of jot-for-jot incorporation); Grant, Felix Frankfurter: A\nDissenting Opinion, 12 UCLA L. Rev. 1013, 1038 (1965) (“If the Court\nwill not reduce the requirements of the fourteenth amendment below\nthe federal gloss that now overlays the Bill of Rights, then it will have\nto reduce that gloss to the point where the states can live with it”).\nAmici argue persuasively that, post-“incorporation,” federal courts will\nhave little choice but to fix a highly flexible standard of review if they\nare to avoid leaving federalism and the separation of powers—not to\nmention gun policy—in shambles. See Brief for Brady Center to\nPrevent Gun Violence et al. as Amici Curiae (hereinafter Brady Center\nBrief).\n   14 Justice Cardozo’s test itself built upon an older line of decisions.\n\nSee, e.g., Chicago, B. & Q.

S. 226, 237 (1897)\n(discussing “limitations on [state] power, which grow out of the essen­\ntial nature of all free governments [and] implied reservations of indi­\nvidual rights, . . . and which are respected by all governments entitled\nto the name” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

Implicit in Justice Cardozo’s test is a recognition\nthat the postulates of liberty have a universal character.\nLiberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that\nprevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations\nof a certain group, or the personal preferences of their\nchampions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they\nare not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized\nas a “rational continuum” of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral\ncommitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause\ntranscend the local and the particular.\n   Justice Cardozo’s test undeniably requires judges to\napply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not\nmean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In\naddition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part\nIII, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds\nground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down\nelsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English\ncommon law, legislative and social facts, scientific and\nprofessional developments, practices of other civilized\nsocieties,15 and, above all else, the “ ‘traditions and con­\nscience of our people,’ ” Palko, 302 U. S., at 325 (quoting\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934)), are\ncritical variables. They can provide evidence about which\nrights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur\nto judicial action.\n   The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in\nits suggestion that later cases rendered Palko’s methodol­\nogy defunct. Echoing Duncan, the Court advises that\nJustice Cardozo’s test will not be satisfied “ ‘if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the par­\n——————\n  15 See Palko, 302 U. S., at 326, n. 3; see also, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas,\n\n539 U. S. 558, 572–573, 576–577 (2003); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 710–\n711, and n. 8.\n\f16                 MCDONALD v.

Palko does contain some language that could be\nread to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process\nrecognition, reserving it for practices without which “nei­\nther liberty nor justice would exist.” 302 U. S., at 326.\nBut in view of Justice Cardozo’s broader analysis, as well\nas the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims\nunder the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over­\nreadings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco­\nnian manner.\n   Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan\nmark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out\nliberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­\nticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­\ning to “criminal processes,” 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did\nnot purport to set a standard for other types of liberty\ninterests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,\nDuncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:\nThe judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac­\ntice “is fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,” within the\ncontext of the “Anglo-American” system. Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important\nrecent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive\ndue process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­\ntion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward\nlooking. See, e.g., Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572\n(2003) (“[H]istory and tradition are the starting point but\nnot in all cases the ending point of the substantive due\nprocess inquiry” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nMichael H. v.

The Court hinges its entire\ndecision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se­\nlected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and\n19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about\nfirearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural­\nity suggests that only interests that have proved “funda­\nmental from an American perspective,” ante, at 37, 44, or\n“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ”\nante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the\nCourt’s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the\nFourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court’s opin­\nion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a\nright is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its\nstatus under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri­\nously mistaken.\n   A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most\nbasically, because our substantive due process doctrine\nhas never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even\npredominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied\nmany of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to\nthe States in the 1960’s, it often asked whether the guar­\nantee in question was “fundamental in the context of the\ncriminal processes maintained by the American States.”17\n——————\n  16 I acknowledge that some have read the Court’s opinion in Glucks­\nberg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all\npurposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology—and thereby to\ndebilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg’s aspiration,\nLawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I\nhave little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.\n  17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question\n\nwas deeply rooted in founding-era practice.

That inquiry could ex­\ntend back through time, but it was focused not so much on\nhistorical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional\nsignificance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­\nized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any\ngiven trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It\nis only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes\nwith other procedures and practices in a criminal justice\nsystem that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”\ncan be determined.\n   Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to\nrecognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights\nrelating to the primary conduct of free individuals—\nJustice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to\nfree speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state\ninfringement not because the States have always honored\nit, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,\nbecause the right to free speech is implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 95,\n96 (1940); see also, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S., at 12 (discuss­\ning right to marry person of another race); Mapp v. Ohio,\n367 U.

S. 147, 161 (1939) (discussing\nright to distribute printed matter).18 While the verbal\nformula has varied, the Court has largely been consistent\nin its liberty-based approach to substantive interests\noutside of the adjudicatory system. As the question before\n——————\n   18 Cf. Robinson v. California, 370 U.

For if it were\nreally the case that the Fourteenth Amendment’s guaran­\ntee of liberty embraces only those rights “so rooted in our\nhistory, tradition, and practice as to require special protec­\ntion,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721, n. 17, then the guar­\nantee would serve little function, save to ratify those\nrights that state actors have already been according the\nmost extensive protection.19 Cf. Duncan, 391 U. S., at 183\n(Harlan, J., dissenting) (critiquing “circular[ity]” of his­\ntoricized test for incorporation). That approach is unfaith­\nful to the expansive principle Americans laid down when\nthey ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and to the level\nof generality they chose when they crafted its language; it\npromises an objectivity it cannot deliver and masks the\nvalue judgments that pervade any analysis of what cus­\ntoms, defined in what manner, are sufficiently “ ‘rooted’ ”;\nit countenances the most revolting injustices in the name\nof continuity,20 for we must never forget that not only\nslavery but also the subjugation of women and other rank\nforms of discrimination are part of our history; and it\neffaces this Court’s distinctive role in saying what the law\nis, leaving the development and safekeeping of liberty to\nmajoritarian political processes. It is judicial abdication in\n——————\n  19 I do not mean to denigrate this function, or to imply that only “new\n\nrights”—whatever one takes that term to mean—ought to “get in” the\nsubstantive due process door.

Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819), a cen­\ntral example of how they “wisely spoke in general lan­\nguage and left to succeeding generations the task of apply­\ning that language to the unceasingly changing\nenvironment in which they would live,” Rehnquist, The\nNotion of a Living Constitution, 54 Tex. L.

Miami L. Rev.\n277, 291 (1986).21 The judge who would outsource the\ninterpretation of “liberty” to historical sentiment has\nturned his back on a task the Constitution assigned to him\nand drained the document of its intended vitality.22\n——————\n  21 JUSTICE  KENNEDY has made the point movingly:\n  “Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the\nFifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the compo­\nnents of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more\nspecific.

In considering\nsuch a majestic term as “liberty” and applying it to present\ncircumstances, how are we to do justice to its urgent call\nand its open texture—and to the grant of interpretive\ndiscretion the latter embodies—without injecting excessive\nsubjectivity or unduly restricting the States’ “broad lati­\ntude in experimenting with possible solutions to problems\nof vital local concern,” Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 597\n(1977)? One part of the answer, already discussed, is that\nwe must ground the analysis in historical experience and\nreasoned judgment, and never on “merely personal and\nprivate notions.” Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 170\n(1952). Our precedents place a number of additional\nconstraints on the decisional process. Although “guide­\nposts for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\narea are scarce and open-ended,” Collins v. Harker\nHeights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992), significant guideposts\ndo exist.23\n——————\npeople throughout our history have thought.” Ibid. Where we part\nways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical\nconsiderations.\n  There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that\n“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,\non the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­\nment process, ante, at 3, on the other. The American people can of\ncourse reverse this Court’s rulings through that same process.\n  23 In assessing concerns about the “open-ended[ness]” of this area of\n\nlaw, Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, one does well to keep in view the malle­\nability not only of the Court’s “deeply rooted”/fundamentality standard\nbut also of substantive due process’ constitutional cousin, “equal\nprotection” analysis. Substantive due process is sometimes accused of\nentailing an insufficiently “restrained methodology.” Glucksberg, 521\nU. S., at 721. Yet “the word ‘liberty’ in the Due Process Clause seems to\nprovide at least as much meaningful guidance as does the word ‘equal’\nin the Equal Protection Clause.” Post, The Supreme Court 2002\nTerm—Foreword: Fashioning the Legal Constitution: Culture, Courts,\nand Law, 117 Harv.

CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n   The most basic is that we have eschewed attempts to\nprovide any all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n“liberty.”24 That project is bound to end in failure or\nworse. The Framers did not express a clear understand­\ning of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated\nLochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial\noverconfidence in using substantive due process to ad­\nvance a broad theory of the right or the good. See, e.g.,\nLochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). In its most\ndurable precedents, the Court “has not attempted to define\nwith exactness the liberty . . . guaranteed” by the Four­\nteenth Amendment. Meyer, 262 U. S., at 399; see also,\ne.g., Bolling, 347 U. S, at 499. By its very nature, the\nmeaning of liberty cannot be “reduced to any formula; its\ncontent cannot be determined by reference to any code.”\nPoe, 367 U. S., at 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Yet while “the ‘liberty’ specially protected by the Four­\nteenth Amendment” is “perhaps not capable of being fully\nclarified,” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 722, it is capable of\nbeing refined and delimited. We have insisted that only\ncertain types of especially significant personal interests\nmay qualify for especially heightened protection. Ever\nsince “the deviant economic due process cases [were]\nrepudiated,” id., at 761 (Souter, J., concurring in judg­\n——————\nis that the text of the [Due Process] Clause warrants providing only\nprotections of process rather than protections of substance,” “it is\nstriking that even those Justices who are most theoretically opposed to\nsubstantive due process, like Scalia and Rehnquist, are also nonethe­\nless enthusiastic about applying the equal protection component of the\nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the federal govern­\nment.” Ibid. (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.

It means that one lacks the hubris to adopt\na rigid, context-independent definition of a constitutional guarantee\nthat was deliberately framed in open-ended terms.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 482, and has instead cen­\ntered on “matters relating to marriage, procreation, con­\ntraception, family relationships, and child rearing and\neducation,” Paul v. Davis, 424 U. S. 693, 713 (1976).\nThese categories are not exclusive. Government action\nthat shocks the conscience, pointlessly infringes settled\nexpectations, trespasses into sensitive private realms or\nlife choices without adequate justification, perpetrates\ngross injustice, or simply lacks a rational basis will always\nbe vulnerable to judicial invalidation. Nor does the fact\nthat an asserted right falls within one of these categories\nend the inquiry. More fundamental rights may receive\nmore robust judicial protection, but the strength of the\nindividual’s liberty interests and the State’s regulatory\ninterests must always be assessed and compared. No\nright is absolute.\n   Rather than seek a categorical understanding of the\nliberty clause, our precedents have thus elucidated a\nconceptual core. The clause safeguards, most basically,\n“the ability independently to define one’s identity,” Roberts\nv. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 619 (1984), “the\nindividual’s right to make certain unusually important\ndecisions that will affect his own, or his family’s, destiny,”\nFitzgerald, 523 F. 2d, at 719, and the right to be respected\nas a human being. Self-determination, bodily integrity,\nfreedom of conscience, intimate relationships, political\nequality, dignity and respect—these are the central values\nwe have found implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\n   Another key constraint on substantive due process\nanalysis is respect for the democratic process. If a particu­\nlar liberty interest is already being given careful consid­\neration in, and subjected to ongoing calibration by, the\nStates, judicial enforcement may not be appropriate.\nWhen the Court declined to establish a general right to\n\f24                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nphysician-assisted suicide, for example, it did so in part\nbecause “the States [were] currently engaged in serious,\nthoughtful examinations of physician-assisted suicide and\nother similar issues,” rendering judicial intervention both\nless necessary and potentially more disruptive. Glucks­\nberg, 521 U. S., at 719, 735. Conversely, we have long\nappreciated that more “searching” judicial review may be\njustified when the rights of “discrete and insular minori­\nties”—groups that may face systematic barriers in the\npolitical system—are at stake. United States v. Carolene\nProducts Co., 304 U. S. 144, 153, n. 4 (1938). Courts have\na “comparative . . . advantage” over the elected branches\non a limited, but significant, range of legal matters. Post,\nat 8.\n   Recognizing a new liberty right is a momentous step. It\ntakes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the\narena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,\n521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must\nbe taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­\nnity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and\ndemand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to\nthe interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and\nthe practical realities of contemporary society provides an\nimportant tool for guiding judicial discretion.\n   This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the\nneed to approach our work with humility and caution.\nBecause the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­\ncious,” Duncan, 391 U. S., at 148, I have emphasized that\n“[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to\nexercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break\nnew ground in this field.” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125. Many\nof my colleagues and predecessors have stressed the same\npoint, some with great eloquence. See, e.g., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 502–\n503 (1977) (plurality opinion); Poe, 367 U. S., at 542–545\n(Harlan, J., dissenting); Adamson v. California, 332 U. S.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

But\nthe inescapable reality is that no serious theory of Section\n1 of the Fourteenth Amendment yields clear answers in\nevery case, and “[n]o formula could serve as a substitute,\nin this area, for judgment and restraint.” Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such\nrestraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­\ners, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­\ncisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­\nests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the\ncommon-law method—taking cases and controversies as\nthey present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­\ntally, building on what came before. This restrained\nmethodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­\ntion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been\nmuch easier for the Court simply to declare certain\nAmendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States\nin toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into\nits component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.\nThis piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize\nmore closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­\ning both the risk and the cost of error.\n   Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an\nabstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­\ndue-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted\nfundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at\n721 (quoting Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993);\nCollins, 503 U. S., at 125; Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of\nHealth, 497 U. S. 261, 277–278 (1990)). And just as we\nhave required such careful description from the litigants,\nwe have required of ourselves that we “focus on the allega­\ntions in the complaint to determine how petitioner de­\nscribes the constitutional right at stake.” Collins, 503\nU. S., at 125; see also Stevens, Judicial Restraint, 22 San\n\f26                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDiego L. Rev. 437, 446–448 (1985). This does not mean\nthat we must define the asserted right at the most specific\nlevel, thereby sapping it of a universal valence and a\nmoral force it might otherwise have.25 It means, simply,\nthat we must pay close attention to the precise liberty\ninterest the litigants have asked us to vindicate.\n   Our holdings should be similarly tailored. Even if the\nmost expansive formulation of a claim does not qualify for\nsubstantive due process recognition, particular compo­\nnents of the claim might. Just because there may not be a\ncategorical right to physician-assisted suicide, for exam­\nple, does not “ ‘foreclose the possibility that an individual\nplaintiff seeking to hasten her death, or a doctor whose\nassistance was sought, could prevail in a more particular­\nized challenge.’ ” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 735, n. 24\n(quoting id., at 750 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judg­\nments)); see also Vacco v. Quill, 521 U. S. 793, 809, n. 13\n(1997) (leaving open “ ‘the possibility that some applica­\ntions of the [New York prohibition on assisted suicide]\nmay impose an intolerable intrusion on the patient’s free­\ndom’ ”). Even if a State’s interest in regulating a certain\nmatter must be permitted, in the general course, to trump\nthe individual’s countervailing liberty interest, there may\n——————\n  25 The notion that we should define liberty claims at the most specific\nlevel available is one of JUSTICE SCALIA’s signal contributions to the\ntheory of substantive due process. See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D.,\n491 U. S. 110, 127–128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of SCALIA, J.); ante, at 7\n(opinion of SCALIA, J.).

L.\n983, 1002, n. 73 (2006): When one defines the liberty interest at issue in\nLawrence as the freedom to perform specific sex acts, ante, at 2, the\ninterest starts to look less compelling. The Court today does not follow\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s “particularizing” method, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384\nU. S. 641, 649 (1966), as it relies on general historical references to\nkeeping and bearing arms, without any close study of the States’\npractice of regulating especially dangerous weapons.\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

It has not been. The question,\nrather, is whether the particular right asserted by peti­\ntioners applies to the States because of the Fourteenth\nAmendment itself, standing on its own bottom. And to\nanswer that question, we need to determine, first, the\nnature of the right that has been asserted and, second,\nwhether that right is an aspect of Fourteenth Amendment\n“liberty.” Even accepting the Court’s holding in Heller, it\nremains entirely possible that the right to keep and bear\narms identified in that opinion is not judicially enforceable\nagainst the States, or that only part of the right is so\nenforceable.26 It is likewise possible for the Court to find\n——————\n  26 In District of Columbia v.

If that conclusion were wrong, then petitioners’ “incor­\nporation” claim clearly would fail, as they would hold no right against\nthe Federal Government to be free from regulations such as the ones\nthey challenge. Cf. post, at 8. I do not understand petitioners or any of\ntheir amici to dispute this point. Yet even if Heller had never been\ndecided—indeed, even if the Second Amendment did not exist—we\nwould still have an obligation to address petitioners’ Fourteenth\n\f28                   MCDONALD v.

The city of Chicago allows resi­\ndents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are\nregistered, but it generally prohibits the possession of\nhandguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­\nbarreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–\n050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their\ndesire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references\nthe “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–\n4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did\ntheir supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,\n49–52, 54–56. Petitioners now frame the question that\nconfronts us as “[w]hether the Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\nor Due Process Clauses.” Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it\nis our duty “to focus on the allegations in the complaint to\ndetermine how petitioner describes the constitutional\nright at stake,” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the\ngravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a\nhandgun or other firearm of one’s choosing in the home.\n   Petitioners’ framing of their complaint tracks the\nCourt’s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained\nsome dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive\n——————\nAmendment claim.\n   27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that\n\nmay raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)\n(quoting Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1 (2007), 27–1–1\n(2009)).

S., at ___ (slip op.,\nat 63), it is incumbent upon us, as federal judges contem­\nplating a novel rule that would bind all 50 States, to pro­\nceed cautiously and to decide only what must be decided.\n   Understood as a plea to keep their preferred type of\nfirearm in the home, petitioners’ argument has real\nforce.28 The decision to keep a loaded handgun in the\nhouse is often motivated by the desire to protect life, lib­\nerty, and property. It is comparable, in some ways, to\ndecisions about the education and upbringing of one’s\nchildren. For it is the kind of decision that may have\nprofound consequences for every member of the family,\nand for the world beyond. In considering whether to keep\na handgun, heads of households must ask themselves\nwhether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of\ndeliberate or accidental misuse that may result in death or\nserious injury, not only to residents of the home but to\n——————\n   28 To the extent that petitioners contend the city of Chicago’s registra­\n\ntion requirements for firearm possessors also, and separately, violate\nthe Constitution, that claim borders on the frivolous. Petitioners make\nno effort to demonstrate that the requirements are unreasonable or\nthat they impose a severe burden on the underlying right they have\nasserted.\n\f30                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nothers as well. Millions of Americans have answered this\nquestion in the affirmative, not infrequently because they\nbelieve they have an inalienable right to do so—because\nthey consider it an aspect of “the supreme human dignity\nof being master of one’s fate rather than a ward of the\nState,” Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U. S. 164, 186 (2008)\n(SCALIA, J., dissenting). Many such decisions have been\nbased, in part, on family traditions and deeply held beliefs\nthat are an aspect of individual autonomy the government\nmay not control.29\n  Bolstering petitioners’ claim, our law has long recog­\nnized that the home provides a kind of special sanctuary\nin modern life. See, e.g., U. S. Const., Amdts. 3, 4; Law­\nrence, 539 U. S., at 562, 567; Payton v. New York, 445\nU. S. 573, 585–590 (1980); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S.\n557, 565–568 (1969); Griswold, 381 U. S., at 484–485.\nConsequently, we have long accorded special deference to\nthe privacy of the home, whether a humble cottage or a\nmagnificent manse. This veneration of the domestic hark­\nens back to the common law. William Blackstone recog­\nnized a “right of habitation,” 4 Commentaries *223, and\nopined that “every man’s house is looked upon by the law\nto be his castle of defence and asylum,” 3 id., at *288.\nHeller carried forward this legacy, observing that “the\nneed for defense of self, family, and property is most\nacute” in one’s abode, and celebrating “the right of law­\nabiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of\nhearth and home.” 554 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 56,\n63).\n  While the individual’s interest in firearm possession is\nthus heightened in the home, the State’s corresponding\ninterest in regulation is somewhat weaker. The State\n——————\n  29 Members of my generation, at least, will recall the many passionate\n\nstatements of this view made by the distinguished actor, Charlton\nHeston.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

The historical case for\nregulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many\nStates have for many years imposed stricter, and less\ncontroversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on\ntheir domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at\n54) (noting that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to\nconsider the question held that prohibitions on carrying\nconcealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend­\nment or state analogues”); English v. State, 35 Tex. 473,\n478–479 (1871) (observing that “almost, if not every one of\nthe States of this Union have [a prohibition on the carry­\ning of deadly weapons] upon their statute books,” and\nlambasting claims of a right to carry such weapons as\n“little short of ridiculous”); Miller, Guns as Smut: Defend­\ning the Home-Bound Second Amendment, 109 Colum.\nL. Rev. 1278, 1321–1336 (2009).\n   It is significant, as well, that a rule limiting the federal\nconstitutional right to keep and bear arms to the home\nwould be less intrusive on state prerogatives and easier to\nadminister. Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal\nuncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of\nimposing a national rule on the States in this area for the\nfirst time in United States history, the Court could at least\nmoderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the\nStates by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly\n——————\n  30 See  Municipal Respondents’ Brief 20, n. 11 (stating that at least\n156 Second Amendment challenges were brought in time between\nHeller’s issuance and brief’s filing); Brady Center Brief 3 (stating that\nover 190 Second Amendment challenges were brought in first 18\nmonths since Heller); Brief for Villages of Winnetka and Skokie, Illi­\nnois, et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (stating that, in wake of Heller, munici­\npalities have “repealed longstanding handgun laws to avoid costly\nlitigation”).\n\f32                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nbounded in scope.\n  In their briefs to this Court, several amici have sought\nto bolster petitioners’ claim still further by invoking a\nright to individual self-defense.31 As petitioners note, the\nHeller majority discussed this subject extensively and\nremarked that “[t]he inherent right of self-defense has\nbeen central to the Second Amendment right.” 554 U. S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were\nto try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of\ndefending themselves from imminent physical threats, or\nto deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re­\nsponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi­\ncant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process right to be spared such untenable\ndilemmas is a serious one.32\n——————\n  31 See, e.g., Brief for Professors of Philosophy, Criminology, Law, and\nOther Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement\nEducators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29–45; Brief\nfor 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12–31.\n  32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,\n\nhowever, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self­\ndefense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi­\nnal Law Defenses §132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly\nan interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And\nthe States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this\ninterest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and\namounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of\naggressors, the availability of the “castle doctrine,” and so forth. See\nBrief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus\nCuriae 9–21; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19; 2\nW. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.4, pp. 142–160 (2d ed. 2003).\nSuch variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist\nsystem, as the States and localities select different rules in light of\ndifferent priorities, customs, and conditions.\n  As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of\nself-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We\nhave generally understood Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” as some­\nthing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal\nright of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     33\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n  But that is not the case before us. Petitioners have not\nasked that we establish a constitutional right to individual\nself-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court\nnor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor\ndo petitioners contend that the city of Chicago—which,\nrecall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot­\nguns, and to keep them loaded—has unduly burdened any\nsuch right. What petitioners have asked is that we “incor­\nporate” the Second Amendment and thereby establish a\nconstitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,\nto keep a handgun in the home.\n  Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic­\ning self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of\naction is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and\nutilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that\naction. And while some might favor handguns, it is not\n——————\ngovernment tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere\nwith (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces­\nsary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy\nthat, in entering civil society and gaining “the advantages of mutual\ncommerce” and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,\nto a significant degree, “that wild and savage liberty” one possessed in\nthe state of nature. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *125; see also, e.g.,\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §128, pp. 63–64 (J.\nGough ed. 1947) (in state of nature man has power “to do whatever he\nthinks fit for the preservation of himself and others,” but this “he gives\nup when he joins in a . . . particular political society”); Green v. Biddle,\n8 Wheat. 1, 63 (1823) (“It is a trite maxim, that man gives up a part of\nhis natural liberty when he enters into civil society, as the price of the\nblessings of that state: and it may be said, with truth, that this liberty\nis well exchanged for the advantages which flow from law and justice”).\nSome strains of founding-era thought took a very narrow view of the\nright to armed self-defense. See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early\nAmerican Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici\nCuriae 6–13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because\nthere may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self­\ndefense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric­\ntions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional\nright to the same.\n\f34                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nclear that they are a superior weapon for lawful self­\ndefense, and nothing in petitioners’ argument turns on\nthat being the case. The notion that a right of self-defense\nimplies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm\npresupposes not only controversial judgments about the\nstrength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but\nalso controversial assumptions about the likely effects\nof making that type of firearm more broadly available. It\nis a very long way from the proposition that the Four­\nteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of\nself-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban\nhandguns.33\n  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in\nparticular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly\nrelevant to an assessment of petitioners’ asserted right,\nthere is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.\nThe question we must decide is whether the interest in\nkeeping in the home a firearm of one’s choosing—a hand­\ngun, for petitioners—is one that is “comprised within the\nterm liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney, 274\nU. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n\n——————\n  33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly\n\ndistinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly\nmisconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of\npersonal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state\nmilitias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with\ntyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,\nnot with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear\nthat self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and\nsubstance of the Amendment’s guarantee. The Court struck down the\nDistrict of Columbia’s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand­\nguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for\nthat purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–58). And the Court’s\ncommon-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the\nright, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55), had little to do with self-defense.\n\f                    Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                  35\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\n                             V\n   While I agree with the Court that our substantive due\nprocess cases offer a principled basis for holding that\npetitioners have a constitutional right to possess a usable\nfiream in the home, I am ultimately persuaded that a\nbetter reading of our case law supports the city of Chicago.\nI would not foreclose the possibility that a particular\nplaintiff—say, an elderly widow who lives in a dangerous\nneighborhood and does not have the strength to operate a\nlong gun—may have a cognizable liberty interest in pos­\nsessing a handgun. But I cannot accept petitioners’\nbroader submission. A number of factors, taken together,\nlead me to this conclusion.\n   First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­\ntionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners\ndefend their families and property from intruders, they\ncan help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent\nvictims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far\nfrom hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of\nour communities. Amici calculate that approximately one\nmillion Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire\nin the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer\ndisproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­\nguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some\nhomeowners may prefer handguns because of their small\nsize, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals\nwill value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).\nIn recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more\nthan four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of\n\n\n——————\n  34 Brady  Center Brief 11 (extrapolating from Government statistics);\nsee also Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 6–7 (reporting estimated social cost of firearm-related violence\nof $100 billion per year).\n\f36                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nall murders nationwide.35\n   Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from\nparticular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides\nof the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as\nwell as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique\npotential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to\ndestabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and\nbearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in\nbeing and feeling safe from armed violence. And while\ngranting you the right to own a handgun might make you\nsafer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal\ncontribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri­\nbution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis­\nchief—it may make you and the community you live in\nless safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand­\nguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ­\nratically elected legislature to take such concerns into\naccount in considering what sorts of regulations would\nbest serve the public welfare.\n   The practical impact of various gun-control measures\nmay be highly controversial, but this basic insight should\nnot be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive\nthreat to the social order—and that reasonable restric­\ntions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur­\nden on one’s personal liberty—is as old as the Republic.\nAs THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a\nfoundational premise of modern government that the\nState holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: “A basic\nstep in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword\nout of private hands and turn it over to an organized\ngovernment, acting on behalf of all the people.” Robertson\n——————\n   35 Bogus, Gun Control and America’s Cities: Public Policy and Poli­\n\ntics, 1 Albany Govt.

The same holds true for the hand­\ngun. The power a man has in the state of nature “of doing\nwhatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself\nand the rest of mankind, he gives up,” to a significant\nextent, “to be regulated by laws made by the society.”\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §129, p. 64\n(J. Gough ed. 1947).\n   Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and\nbear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does\nnot dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has\nlong afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,\nwe have never understood that principle to “infring[e]\nupon” the authority of the States to proscribe certain\ninherently dangerous items, for “[i]n such cases, compel­\nling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi­\nvidual to possess those materials.” Stanley, 394 U. S., at\n568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home\nmay not stay in the home. Even if the government has a\nweaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire­\narms as compared to public carriage—and even if a blan­\nket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might\ntherefore be unconstitutional—the line between the two is\na porous one. A state or local legislature may determine\nthat a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon\nis necessary to police that line.\n   Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing\nis different in kind from the liberty interests we have\nrecognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the\nplethora of substantive due process cases that have been\ndecided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none\nthat holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty”\nencompasses either the common-law right of self-defense\nor a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a\nmoment that many Americans feel deeply passionate\nabout firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life\n\f38                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not\nappear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or\nany particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of\nautonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace\noffers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper­\nfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici\nmake such a contention. Petitioners’ claim is not the kind\nof substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,\njudicially enforced national standard is presumptively\nappropriate.36\n   Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue\nmay be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish\nto acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain\nfirearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the\npossession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as\nproperty interests subject to definition and regulation by\nthe States. Cf. Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v.\nFlorida Dept. of Environmental Protection, 560 U. S. ___,\n___ (2010) (slip op., at 1) (opinion of SCALIA, J.) (“Gener­\nally speaking, state law defines property interests”).\n——————\n  36 JUSTICE SCALIA worries that there is no “objective” way to decide\nwhat is essential to a “liberty-filled” existence: Better, then, to ignore\nsuch messy considerations as how an interest actually affects people’s\nlives. Ante, at 10. Both the constitutional text and our cases use the\nterm “liberty,” however, and liberty is not a purely objective concept.\nSubstantive due process analysis does not require any “political”\njudgment, ibid. It does require some amount of practical and norma­\ntive judgment. The only way to assess what is essential to fulfilling the\nConstitution’s guarantee of “liberty,” in the present day, is to provide\nreasons that apply to the present day. I have provided many; JUSTICE\nSCALIA and the Court have provided virtually none.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA also misstates my argument when he refers to “the\nright to keep and bear arms,” without qualification. Ante, at 9. That is\nwhat the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government\ninfringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend­\nment liberty interest asserted by petitioners—the interest in keeping a\nfirearm of one’s choosing in the home—is not necessarily coextensive\nwith the Second Amendment right.\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

To be sure, some of the\nBill of Rights’ procedural guarantees may place “restric­\ntions on law enforcement” that have “controversial public\nsafety implications.” Ante, at 36 (plurality opinion); see\nalso ante, at 9 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But those implica­\ntions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant’s invo­\ncation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,\nor to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any\nthreat. The defendant’s liberty interest is constrained by\n(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.\nThe link between handgun ownership and public safety is\nmuch tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the\nhandgun’s bullets are the violence.\n   Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound\noffense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the\npractices of another religion, or a gay couple’s choice to\nhave intimate relations. But that offense is moral, psycho­\nlogical, or theological in nature; the actions taken by the\n——————\n   37 It has not escaped my attention that the Due Process Clause refers\n\nto “property” as well as “liberty.” Cf. ante, at 2, n. 1, 9–10, n. 6 (opinion\nof SCALIA, J.). Indeed, in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977)\n(plurality opinion), I alone viewed “the critical question” as “whether\nEast Cleveland’s housing ordinance [was] a permissible restriction on\nappellant’s right to use her own property as she sees fit,” id., at 513\n(opinion concurring in judgment). In that case, unlike in this case, the\nasserted property right was coextensive with a right to organize one’s\nfamily life, and I could find “no precedent” for the ordinance at issue,\nwhich “exclude[d] any of an owner’s relatives from the group of persons\nwho may occupy his residence on a permanent basis.” Id., at 520. I am\nopen to property claims under the Fourteenth Amendment. This case\njust involves a weak one. And ever since the Court “incorporated” the\nmore specific property protections of the Takings Clause in 1897, see\nChicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S. 226, substantive due process doctrine\nhas focused on liberty.\n\f40                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                        STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrights-bearers do not actually threaten the physical safety\nof any other person.38 Firearms may be used to kill an­\nother person. If a legislature’s response to dangerous\nweapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi­\nviduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so\non the basis of more than the majority’s “ ‘own moral\ncode,’ ” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505\nU. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be\nmisguided, gun control is an area in which it “is quite\nwrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy\nmutually exclusive zones—that as one expands, the other\nmust contract.” Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.\n   Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,\nincluding those that share our British heritage, undercuts\nthe notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms\nis intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries\nplace restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of\nfirearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in\nthis Nation. See Municipal Respondents’ Brief 21–23\n(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,\nDenmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That\nthe United States is an international outlier in the per­\nmissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that\nour laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court\nmay not need to assume responsibility for making our\nlaws still more permissive.\n   Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in\nmany relevant respects, including their problems with\nviolent crime and the traditional role that firearms have\nplayed in their societies. But they are not so different\nfrom the United States that we ought to dismiss their\nexperience entirely. Cf. ante, at 34–35 (plurality opinion);\nante, at 10–11 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).

While the “Ameri­\ncan perspective” must always be our focus, ante, at 37, 44\n(plurality opinion), it is silly—indeed, arrogant—to think\nwe have nothing to learn about liberty from the billions of\npeople beyond our borders.\n   Fourth, the Second Amendment differs in kind from the\nAmendments that surround it, with the consequence that\nits inclusion in the Bill of Rights is not merely unhelpful\nbut positively harmful to petitioners’ claim. Generally, the\ninclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points\ntoward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance\nand ought to be enforceable against the States. But the\nSecond Amendment plays a peculiar role within the Bill, as\nannounced by its peculiar opening clause.39 Even accept­\ning the Heller Court’s view that the Amendment protects\nan individual right to keep and bear arms disconnected\nfrom militia service, it remains undeniable that “the pur­\npose for which the right was codified” was “to prevent\nelimination of the militia.” Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip\nop., at 26); see also United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174,\n178 (1939) (Second Amendment was enacted “[w]ith obvi­\nous purpose to assure the continuation and render possible\nthe effectiveness of [militia] forces”). It was the States, not\nprivate persons, on whose immediate behalf the Second\nAmendment was adopted. Notwithstanding the Heller\nCourt’s efforts to write the Second Amendment’s preamble\nout of the Constitution, the Amendment still serves the\nstructural function of protecting the States from en­\ncroachment by an overreaching Federal Government.\n——————\n  39 The Second Amendment provides: “A well regulated Militia, being\n\nnecessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\n\f42                     MCDONALD v.

S. 1, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judg­\nment). It is directed at preserving the autonomy of the\nsovereign States, and its logic therefore “resists” incorpo­\nration by a federal court against the States. Ibid. No one\nsuggests that the Tenth Amendment, which provides that\npowers not given to the Federal Government remain with\n“the States,” applies to the States; such a reading would\nborder on incoherent, given that the Tenth Amendment\nexists (in significant part) to safeguard the vitality of state\ngovernance. The Second Amendment is no different.40\n   The Court is surely correct that Americans’ conceptions\nof the Second Amendment right evolved over time in a\nmore individualistic direction; that Members of the Recon­\nstruction Congress were urgently concerned about the\nsafety of the newly freed slaves; and that some Members\nbelieved that, following ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the Second Amendment would apply to the\nStates. But it is a giant leap from these data points to the\nconclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporated”\nthe Second Amendment as a matter of original meaning or\npostenactment interpretation. Consider, for example, that\nthe text of the Fourteenth Amendment says nothing about\nthe Second Amendment or firearms; that there is substan­\ntial evidence to suggest that, when the Reconstruction\nCongress enacted measures to ensure newly freed slaves\n\n——————\n   40 Contrary to JUSTICE SCALIA’s suggestion, this point is perfectly\n\ncompatible with my opinion for the Court in Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1 (2004). Cf. ante, at 11. Like the Court\nitself, I have never agreed with JUSTICE THOMAS’ view that the Estab­\nlishment Clause is a federalism provision. But I agree with his under­\nlying logic: If a clause in the Bill of Rights exists to safeguard federal­\nism interests, then it makes little sense to “incorporate” it. JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s further suggestion that I ought to have revisited the Estab­\nlishment Clause debate in this opinion, ibid., is simply bizarre.\n\f                    Cite as: 561 U.

The Court’s\nnarrative largely elides these facts. The complications\nthey raise show why even the most dogged historical\ninquiry into the “fundamentality” of the Second Amend­\nment right (or any other) necessarily entails judicial\njudgment—and therefore judicial discretion—every step of\nthe way.\n  I accept that the evolution in Americans’ understanding\nof the Second Amendment may help shed light on the\nquestion whether a right to keep and bear arms is com­\nprised within Fourteenth Amendment “liberty.” But the\nreasons that motivated the Framers to protect the ability\nof militiamen to keep muskets available for military use\nwhen our Nation was in its infancy, or that motivated the\nReconstruction Congress to extend full citizenship to the\nfreedmen in the wake of the Civil War, have only a limited\nbearing on the question that confronts the homeowner in a\ncrime-infested metropolis today.

The idea that States may\nplace substantial restrictions on the right to keep and bear\narms short of complete disarmament is, in fact, far more\nentrenched than the notion that the Federal Constitution\nprotects any such right. Federalism is a far “older and\nmore deeply rooted tradition than is a right to carry,” or to\nown, “any particular kind of weapon.” 567 F. 3d 856, 860\n(CA7 2009) (Easterbrook, C.

Cf. post, at 16–17. The city of Chicago, for\nexample, faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal\nstreet gangs. Most rural areas do not. The city of Chicago\nhas a high population density, which increases the poten­\ntial for a gunman to inflict mass terror and casualties.\nMost rural areas do not.45 The city of Chicago offers little\nin the way of hunting opportunities. Residents of rural\ncommunities are, one presumes, much more likely to stock\nthe dinner table with game they have personally felled.\n   Given that relevant background conditions diverge so\nmuch across jurisdictions, the Court ought to pay particu­\nlar heed to state and local legislatures’ “right to experi­\nment.” New State Ice, 285 U.

But the Constitu­\ntion’s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the\nmatter before us—as evidenced by the groundbreaking\nnature of today’s fractured decision—and this Court lacks\nboth the technical capacity and the localized expertise to\nassess “the wisdom, need, and propriety” of most gun­\ncontrol measures. Griswold, 381 U.

Countless factors unrelated to the\npolicy may have contributed to that trend. Without a sophisticated\nregression analysis, we cannot even begin to speculate as to the efficacy\nor effects of the handgun ban. Even with such an analysis, we could\nnever be certain as to the determinants of the city’s murder rate.\n  47 In some sense, it is no doubt true that the “best” solution is elusive\n\nfor many “serious social problems.” Ante, at 12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nYet few social problems have raised such heated empirical controversy\nas the problem of gun violence.

Quite to the con­\ntrary, today’s decision invites an avalanche of litigation\nthat could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determi­\nnations about which state and local regulations comport\nwith the Heller right—the precise contours of which are\nfar from pellucid—under a standard of review we have not\neven established. See post, at 12–15. The plurality’s\n“assuranc[e]” that “incorporation does not imperil every\nlaw regulating firearms,” ante, at 40, provides only modest\ncomfort. For it is also an admission of just how many\ndifferent types of regulations are potentially implicated by\ntoday’s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court’s initial\nattempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.\nThe practical significance of the proposition that “the\nSecond Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,”\nante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by\nthis Court over many, many years.\n  Furthermore, and critically, the Court’s imposition of a\nnational standard is still more unwise because the elected\nbranches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of\nsafeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.\nThe strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con­\nnection with its status in the democratic process. And in\nthis case, no one disputes “that opponents of [gun] control\nhave considerable political power and do not seem to be at\na systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,” or\nthat “the widespread commitment to an individual right to\nown guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or\n\n——————\npluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin­\nion.

Indeed, there is a good deal of\nevidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers\ntend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views\nexpressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss,\nDisarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in\nAmerica 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has\nenacted some “improvident” gun-control measures, as\npetitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent\nreason to infer that the mistake will not “eventually be\nrectified by the democratic process.” Vance v.

Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s\ncritique does not have nearly as much force as does his\nrhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,\ncomes with its own profound difficulties.\n  Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”\n“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,\nante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­\nder the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,\nat 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever\ngets to the history. At what level of generality should one\nframe the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.\nWhat does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this\nNation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will\nthat proposition be tested? Which types of sources will\ncount, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­\ngated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these\nquestions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE\nSCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering\nthem.\n  Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for\nsubstantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has\nstated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply\n\f52                     MCDONALD v.

Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that\ntest requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment—the\nsame multifaceted evaluation of the right’s contours and\nconsequences—that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur­\nrence today.\n   So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel\ninsight that history is not an objective science, and that its\nuse can therefore “point in any direction the judges favor,”\nante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the\npoint was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,\nJUSTICE SCALIA remains “oblivious to the fact that [the\nconcept of ‘tradition’] can be as malleable and elusive as\n‘liberty’ itself.” Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting\nopinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a\ndiscrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of\nthe Second Amendment, the evidence often points in\ndifferent directions. The historian must choose which\npieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try\nto assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,\nJUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much\nearlier and later in time than the Second Amendment\nitself, see, e.g., 554 U.

S.\n551, 617 (2005) (SCALIA, J., dissenting).\n   My point is not to criticize judges’ use of history in\ngeneral or to suggest that it always generates indetermi­\nnate answers; I have already emphasized that historical\nstudy can discipline as well as enrich substantive due\nprocess analysis.     My point is simply that JUSTICE\nSCALIA’s defense of his method, which holds out objectivity\nand restraint as its cardinal—and, it seems, only—virtues,\nis unsatisfying on its own terms. For a limitless number\nof subjective judgments may be smuggled into his histori­\ncal analysis. Worse, they may be buried in the analysis.\nAt least with my approach, the judge’s cards are laid on\nthe table for all to see, and to critique. The judge must\n\f54                       MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                           STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nexercise judgment, to be sure. When answering a consti­\ntutional question to which the text provides no clear an­\nswer, there is always some amount of discretion; our\nconstitutional system has always depended on judges’\nfilling in the document’s vast open spaces.50 But there is\nalso transparency.\n   JUSTICE SCALIA’s approach is even less restrained in\nanother sense: It would effect a major break from our case\nlaw outside of the “incorporation” area. JUSTICE SCALIA\ndoes not seem troubled by the fact that his method is\nlargely inconsistent with the Court’s canonical substantive\ndue process decisions, ranging from Meyer, 262 U. S. 390,\nand Pierce, 268 U. S. 510, in the 1920’s, to Griswold, 381\nU. S. 479, in the 1960’s, to Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558, in the\n2000’s. To the contrary, he seems to embrace this disso­\nnance. My method seeks to synthesize dozens of cases on\nwhich the American people have relied for decades.\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s method seeks to vaporize them. So I am\nleft to wonder, which of us is more faithful to this Nation’s\nconstitutional history? And which of us is more faithful to\nthe values and commitments of the American people, as\nthey stand today? In 1967, when the Court held in Lov­\ning, 388 U. S. 1, that adults have a liberty-based as well as\nequality-based right to wed persons of another race, inter­\nracial marriage was hardly “deeply rooted” in American\ntradition. Racial segregation and subordination were\ndeeply rooted. The Court’s substantive due process hold­\ning was nonetheless correct—and we should be wary of\nany interpretive theory that implies, emphatically, that it\nwas not.\n   Which leads me to the final set of points I wish to make:\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s method invites not only bad history, but\nalso bad constitutional law. As I have already explained,\nin evaluating a claimed liberty interest (or any constitu­\n——————\n 50 Indeed,   this is truly one of our most deeply rooted legal traditions.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           55\n\n                     STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\ntional claim for that matter), it makes perfect sense to give\nhistory significant weight: JUSTICE SCALIA’s position is\ncloser to my own than he apparently feels comfortable\nacknowledging. But it makes little sense to give history\ndispositive weight in every case. And it makes especially\nlittle sense to answer questions like whether the right to\nbear arms is “fundamental” by focusing only on the past,\ngiven that both the practical significance and the public\nunderstandings of such a right often change as society\nchanges. What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at\none time firearm possession contributed substantially to\npersonal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth­\ning, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have\nbeen reasonable to constitutionalize the right?\n   The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical\nviews be less than completely clear or informative, but\nthey can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri­\ncans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not\nto be true. Some practices that many Americans believed\nto be consistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of\nliberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon­\nsistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con­\nstitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal\nexistence. Although we should always “pa[y] a decent\nregard to the opinions of former times,” it “is not the glory\nof the people of America” to have “suffered a blind venera­\ntion for antiquity.” The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal\njudges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to\nthe Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious\nlanguage, in an effort to transform foundational legal\ncommitments into narrow rules of decision.\n   As for “the democratic process,” ante, at 14, 15, a\nmethod that looks exclusively to history can easily do more\nharm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s supposedly objective analysis is to vest\n\f56                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfederal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this\nCourt—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area\nin which they have no special qualifications, and in which\nthe give-and-take of the political process has functioned\neffectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon\nthe democratic process,” ante, at 14, than an approach\nthat would defer to the democratic process on the regula­\ntion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I\ncannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, con­\nstitutes an “intrusion.”\n   It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ­\nracy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA’s critique. Because\nvery few of us would welcome a system in which majorities\nor powerful interest groups always get their way. Under\nour constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a\njudicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have\noutlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic\nnature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­\ncance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its\nreasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­\nstraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,\nand that is willing to protect some rights even if they have\nnot already received uniform protection from the elected\nbranches—has the capacity to improve, rather than\n“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on\njudges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­\nways has, and as it always will.\n                             VII\n  The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in\nthe Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the\nCourt’s decision to enforce that right against the States.\nBy its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the\nStates; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals\noutside of the militia context. The Second Amendment\nwas adopted to protect the States from federal encroach­\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           57\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been\nunderstood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire\nBill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about\ntoday’s outcome.\n   Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen\nas a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­\nquences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­\nally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­\ntional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment\nright identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth\nAmendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the\nhome. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­\nrality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in\nits opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling\nmarks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices\nwho have joined it have brought to bear an awesome\namount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­\nsented by this case.\n   I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set\nout at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­\nogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­\nthough impressively argued, the majority’s decision to\noverturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent\nand to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is\nnot, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings\nof history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­\nlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles\nthat the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers\nhave played in establishing and preserving American\nfreedoms.” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 501 (Harlan, J., con­\ncurring in judgment).\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

As he\nargues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment\nwith this objective in view. See ante, at 41–44 (dissenting\nopinion). Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the\ncarrying of arms for that purpose often puts others’ lives\nat risk. See ante, at 35–37. And the use of arms for pri\nvate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional\nprotection from state regulation. See ante, at 44–51.\n  The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion\nupon “substantive due process” concerns. Rather, it di\nrects its attention to this Court’s “incorporation” prece\ndents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to\nprivate self-defense is “fundamental” so that it applies to\nthe States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,\nat 11–19.\n  I shall therefore separately consider the question of\n“incorporation.” I can find nothing in the Second Amend\nment’s text, history, or underlying rationale that could\nwarrant characterizing it as “fundamental” insofar as it\nseeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri\n\f2                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvate self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification\nfor interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate\nregulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from\ndemocratically elected legislatures to courts or from the\nStates to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment does not “incorporate”\nthe Second Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms.”\nAnd I consequently dissent.\n                               I\n    The Second Amendment says: “A well regulated Militia,\nbeing necessary to the security of a free State, the right of\nthe people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S.\n___ (2008), the Court rejected the pre-existing judicial\nconsensus that the Second Amendment was primarily\nconcerned with the need to maintain a “well regulated\nMilitia.” See id., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op.,\nat 2–3, and n. 2, 38–45); United States v. Miller, 307 U. S.\n174, 178 (1939). Although the Court acknowledged that\n“the threat that the new Federal Government would de\nstroy the citizens’ militia by taking away their arms was\nthe reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti\ntution,” the Court asserted that “individual self defense\n. . . was the central component of the right itself.” Heller,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added). The\nCourt went on to hold that the Second Amendment re\nstricted Congress’ power to regulate handguns used for\nself-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the\nDistrict of Columbia’s ban on the possession of handguns\nin the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).\n    The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon\nits reading of history. But the relevant history in Heller\nwas far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed\nwith the majority’s historical analysis. And subsequent\nscholarly writing reveals why disputed history provides\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Rev. 171 (2008).\n   Consider as an example of these critiques an amici brief\nfiled in this case by historians who specialize in the study\nof the English Civil Wars. They tell us that Heller misun\nderstood a key historical point. See Brief for Eng\nlish/Early American Historians as Amici Curiae (hereinaf\nter English Historians’ Brief) (filed by 21 professors at\nleading universities in the United States, United King\ndom, and Australia). Heller’s conclusion that “individual\nself-defense” was “the central component” of the Second\nAmendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms” rested upon\nits view that the Amendment “codified a pre-existing right”\nthat had “nothing whatever to do with service in a mili\n\f4                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntia.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19–20). That view in\nturn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having\ndescribed the right as “ ‘the right of having and using arms\nfor self-preservation and defence,’ ” which reflected the\nprovision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that\ngave the King’s Protestant “ ‘subjects’ ” the right to “ ‘have\nArms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as\nallowed by law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20) (quoting 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140\n(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. & M., c. 2, §7, in\n3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the\nmajority, understood that right “as permitting a citizen to\n‘repe[l] force by force’ when ‘the intervention of society in\nhis behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.’ ” 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting St. George Tucker, 1\nBlackstone’s Commentaries 145–146, n. 42 (1803)).\n   The historians now tell us, however, that the right to\nwhich Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but every\nthing, to do with the militia. As properly understood at\nthe time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim,\nthe right to bear arms “ensured that Parliament had the\npower” to arm the citizenry: “to defend the realm” in the\ncase of a foreign enemy, and to “secure the right of ‘self\npreservation,’ ” or “self-defense,” should “the sovereign\nusurp the English Constitution.” English Historians’ Brief\n3, 8–13, 23–24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of\nRight says that private persons can possess guns only “as\nallowed by law.” See id., at 20–24. Moreover, when\nBlackstone referred to “ ‘the right of having and using\narms for self-preservation and defence,’ ” he was referring\nto the right of the people “to take part in the militia to\ndefend their political liberties,” and to the right of Parlia\nment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even\nwhen the King sought to deny it that power. Id., at 4, 24–\n27 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140). Nor can\nthe historians find any convincing reason to believe that\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Compare Heller, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 21–22) with English Historians’ Brief 28–40.\nThe historians concede that at least one historian takes a\ndifferent position, see id., at 7, but the Court, they imply,\nwould lose a poll taken among professional historians of\nthis period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.\n   If history, and history alone, is what matters, why\nwould the Court not now reconsider Heller in light of these\nmore recently published historical views? See Leegin\nCreative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc., 551 U. S.\n877, 923–924 (2007) (BREYER, J., dissenting) (noting that\nstare decisis interests are at their lowest with respect to\nrecent and erroneous constitutional decisions that create\nunworkable legal regimes); Citizens United v. Federal\nElection Comm’n, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 47)\n(listing similar factors); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472\nU. S. 38, 99 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (“[S]tare\ndecisis may bind courts as to matters of law, but it cannot\nbind them as to matters of history”). At the least, where\nHeller’s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex\ntend its applicability?\n   My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the\nreefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges\nwho place virtually determinative weight upon historical\nconsiderations. In my own view, the Court should not look\nto history alone but to other factors as well—above all, in\ncases where the history is so unclear that the experts\nthemselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,\nconsider the basic values that underlie a constitutional\nprovision and their contemporary significance. And it\nshould examine as well the relevant consequences and\npractical justifications that might, or might not, warrant\nremoving an important question from the democratic\ndecisionmaking process. See ante, at 16–20 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively\n\f6                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhistorical approach).\n                              II \n\n                              A\n\n   In my view, taking Heller as a given, the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense. Under this Court’s precedents, to incorporate the\nprivate self-defense right the majority must show that the\nright is, e.g., “fundamental to the American scheme of\njustice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968);\nsee ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)\n(finding that the right is “fundamental” and therefore\nincorporated). And this it fails to do.\n   The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost\nexclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.\nAnte, at 20–33. But to do so for incorporation purposes is\nboth wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points\nout, our society has historically made mistakes—for ex\nample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century\nproperty rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting\nopinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,\nhistory often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,\nsupra; Part III, infra.\n   Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation\nquestion, has never stated that the historical status of a\nright is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court\nhas either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin\nions that the right in question has remained fundamental\nover time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, 406 U. S. 404, 410\n(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation\n“inquiry must focus upon the function served” by the right\nin question in “contemporary society” (emphasis added));\nDuncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 154 (1968) (noting\nthat the right in question “continues to receive strong\nsupport”); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

And, indeed, neither of the parties before\nus in this case has asked us to employ the majority’s his\ntory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67–69\n(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo\nrary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of\nChicago et al. 23–31 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)\n(looking to current state practices with respect to the\nright).\n   I thus think it proper, above all where history provides\nno clear answer, to look to other factors in considering\nwhether a right is sufficiently “fundamental” to remove it\nfrom the political process in every State. I would include\namong those factors the nature of the right; any contem\nporary disagreement about whether the right is funda\nmental; the extent to which incorporation will further\nother, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the\nextent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the\nConstitution’s structural aims, including its division of\npowers among different governmental institutions (and\nthe people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,\nto further the Constitution’s effort to ensure that the\ngovernment treats each individual with equal respect?\nWill it help maintain the democratic form of government\nthat the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora\ntion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu\ntion’s efforts to create governmental institutions well\nsuited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?\n   Finally, I would take account of the Framers’ basic\nreason for believing the Court ought to have the power of\njudicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that\npower to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,\nacting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a\npopular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey & J. McClellan\neds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (“This independence of the judges\nis equally requisite to guard the constitution and the\n\f8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,\nwhich” can, at times, lead to “serious oppressions of the\nminor part in the community”). Judges, he thought, may\nfind it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the\nbasic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States\nv. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938).\nThat being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu\nlar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case\nat hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).\n                               B\n   How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,\nI would apply them only to the private self-defense right\ndirectly at issue. After all, the Amendment’s militia\nrelated purpose is primarily to protect States from federal\nregulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related\nregulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see\nalso Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War\nAmendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu\nmerous other institutions today help to safeguard the\nStates and the people from any serious threat of federal\ntyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?\nIt is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con\ncedes, has “largely faded as a popular concern” could\npossibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo\nration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.\nHence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot\nbe based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found\nto be more extensive Second Amendment rights.\n   For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self\ndefense right that the Court would incorporate has noth\ning to do with “the reason” the Framers “codified” the right\nto keep and bear arms “in a written Constitution.” 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller\nimmediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe\nless “the central component of the right.” Ibid.

See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the\nFramers’ basic reasons for including language in the Con\nstitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid\ning about the contemporary importance of a right) than\nthe particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would\nhave then assigned to the words they used. And examina\ntion of the Framers’ motivation tells us they did not think\nthe private armed self-defense right was of paramount\nimportance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu\ntion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (“[T]o see the [Sec\nond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ\nual right to hunt, or protect one’s home,” would be “like\nviewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as\nthe right of persons to meet to play bridge”); see also, e.g.,\nRakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of\nOriginalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127–128 (2000);\nBrief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu\ntional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22–33.\n   Further, there is no popular consensus that the private\nself-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The\nplurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case\nshow such a consensus, see ante, at 42–43, but, of course,\nnumerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora\ntion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms\nextensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the\nappropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement\nrests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the\nright essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the\nhome; the other side believes it essential to regulate the\nright in order to protect the lives of others attacked with\nguns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de\nvelop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of\nfirearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to\nbe, a hotly contested matter of political debate. See, e.g.,\nSiegel, Dead or Alive: Originalism as Popular Constitu\n\f10                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntionalism in Heller, 122 Harv. L. Rev. 191, 201–246 (2008).\n(Numerous sources supporting arguments and data in\nPart II–B can be found in the Appendix, infra.)\n   Moreover, there is no reason here to believe that incor\nporation of the private self-defense right will further any\nother or broader constitutional objective. We are aware of\nno argument that gun-control regulations target or are\npassed with the purpose of targeting “discrete and insular\nminorities.” Carolene Products Co., supra, at 153, n. 4;\nsee, e.g., ante, at 49–51 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). Nor will\nincorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.\nUnlike the First Amendment’s rights of free speech, free\npress, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense\nright does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic\nprocess that the Constitution seeks to establish. See, e.g.,\nWhitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis,\nJ., concurring). Unlike the First Amendment’s religious\nprotections, the Fourth Amendment’s protection against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments’ insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and\nthe Eighth Amendment’s protection against cruel and\nunusual punishments, the private self-defense right does\nnot significantly seek to protect individuals who might\notherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the\nhands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by\nmany of these same Amendments, it does not involve\nmatters as to which judges possess a comparative exper\ntise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice\nsystem and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend\nment’s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve\na matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself\nproperty belonging to a minority.\n   Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant\ndisruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak\ning authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution’s\nability to further its objectives.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   First, on any reasonable accounting, the incorporation of\nthe right recognized in Heller would amount to a signifi\ncant incursion on a traditional and important area of state\nconcern, altering the constitutional relationship between\nthe States and the Federal Government. Private gun\nregulation is the quintessential exercise of a State’s “police\npower”—i.e., the power to “protec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,\nhealth, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec\ntion of all property within the State,” by enacting “all\nkinds of restraints and burdens” on both “persons and\nproperty.” Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 62 (1873)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Court has long\nrecognized that the Constitution grants the States special\nauthority to enact laws pursuant to this power. See, e.g.,\nMedtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 475 (1996) (noting\nthat States have “great latitude” to use their police powers\n(internal quotation marks omitted)); Metropolitan Life Ins.\nCo. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 756 (1985). A decade\nago, we wrote that there is “no better example of the police\npower” than “the suppression of violent crime.” United\nStates v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 618 (2000). And exam\nples in which the Court has deferred to state legislative\njudgments in respect to the exercise of the police power\nare legion. See, e.g., Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243,\n270 (2006) (assisted suicide); Washington v. Glucksberg,\n521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (same); Berman v. Parker, 348\nU. S. 26, 32 (1954) (“We deal, in other words, with what\ntraditionally has been known as the police power. An\nattempt to define its reach or trace its outer limits is\nfruitless . . .”).\n   Second, determining the constitutionality of a particular\nstate gun law requires finding answers to complex empiri\ncally based questions of a kind that legislatures are better\nable than courts to make. See, e.g., Los Angeles v. Ala\nmeda Books, Inc., 535 U. S. 425, 440 (2002) (plurality\nopinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520\n\f12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nU. S. 180, 195–196 (1997). And it may require this kind of\nanalysis in virtually every case.\n   Government regulation of the right to bear arms nor\nmally embodies a judgment that the regulation will help\nsave lives. The determination whether a gun regulation is\nconstitutional would thus almost always require the\nweighing of the constitutional right to bear arms against\nthe “primary concern of every government—a concern for\nthe safety and indeed the lives of its citizens.” United\nStates v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 755 (1987). With respect\nto other incorporated rights, this sort of inquiry is some\ntimes present. See, e.g., Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S.\n444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (free speech); Sherbert v.\nVerner, 374 U. S. 398, 403 (1963) (religion); Brigham City\nv. Stuart, 547 U. S. 398, 403–404 (2006) (Fourth Amend\nment); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 655 (1984)\n(Fifth Amendment); Salerno, supra, at 755 (bail). But\nhere, this inquiry—calling for the fine tuning of protective\nrules—is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.\n   Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to\nanswer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.\nSuppose, for example, that after a gun regulation’s adop\ntion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation\nwould the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this\nconclusion affected by the local recession which has left\nnumerous people unemployed? What about budget cuts\nthat led to a downsizing of the police force? How effective\nwas that police force to begin with? And did the regula\ntion simply take guns from those who use them for lawful\npurposes without affecting their possession by criminals?\n   Consider too that countless gun regulations of many\nshapes and sizes are in place in every State and in many\nlocal communities. Does the right to possess weapons for\nself-defense extend outside the home? To the car? To\nwork? What sort of guns are necessary for self-defense?\nHandguns? Rifles? Semiautomatic weapons? When is a\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          13\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ngun semi-automatic? Where are different kinds of weap\nons likely needed? Does time-of-day matter? Does the\npresence of a child in the house matter? Does the pres\nence of a convicted felon in the house matter? Do police\nneed special rules permitting patdowns designed to find\nguns? When do registration requirements become severe\nto the point that they amount to an unconstitutional ban?\nWho can possess guns and of what kind? Aliens? Prior\ndrug offenders? Prior alcohol abusers? How would the\nright interact with a state or local government’s ability to\ntake special measures during, say, national security emer\ngencies? As the questions suggest, state and local gun\nregulation can become highly complex, and these “are only\na few uncertainties that quickly come to mind.” Caperton\nv. A. T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (ROB-\nERTS, C. J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n   The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is\nexceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms\ncause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United\nStates each year. Those who live in urban areas, police\nofficers, women, and children, all may be particularly at\nrisk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some\nexperts have calculated, for example, that Chicago’s hand\ngun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to\n1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue\nthat stringent gun regulations “can help protect police\nofficers operating on the front lines against gun violence,”\nhave reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and\nBaltimore, and have helped to lower New York’s crime and\nhomicide rates.\n   At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt\non these studies. And who is right? Finding out may\nrequire interpreting studies that are only indirectly re\nlated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning\nhandguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci\ndents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home\n\f14                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nthan where there is a long gun in the home or no gun at\nall? To what extent do such studies justify a ban? What if\nopponents of the ban put forth counter studies?\n   In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer\nto judicial homilies, such as Blackstone’s 18th-century\nperception that a man’s home is his castle. See 4 Black\nstone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere\nassertion, the fact that “incorporation will require judges\nto assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.”\nAnte, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the\ngovernment’s regulatory interests without addressing\nissues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a\nregulation is appropriately tailored without considering its\nimpact? And how can the Court determine if there are\nless restrictive alternatives without considering what will\nhappen if those alternatives are implemented?\n   Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the\nmission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden\ntial approach similar to the many state courts that admin\nister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,\nat 19–20 (describing state approaches). But the Court has\nnot yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n57–64) (rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” simi\nlar to that employed by the States); ante, at 44 (plurality\nopinion). Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few\nsimple rules, such as that it will not touch “prohibitions on\nthe possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,”\n“laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive\nplaces such as schools and government buildings,” or “laws\nimposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial\nsale of arms.” Heller, 544 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55);\nAnte, at 39 (plurality opinion). But why these rules and\nnot others? Does the Court know that these regulations\nare justified by some special gun-related risk of death? In\nfact, the Court does not know. It has simply invented\nrules that sound sensible without being able to explain\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nwhy or how Chicago’s handgun ban is different.\n  The fact is that judges do not know the answers to the\nkinds of empirically based questions that will often deter\nmine the need for particular forms of gun regulation. Nor\ndo they have readily available “tools” for finding and\nevaluating the technical material submitted by others.\nDistrict Attorney’s Office for Third Judicial Dist. v. Os\nborne, 557 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21); see also\nTurner Broadcasting, 520 U. S., at 195–196. Judges can\nnot easily make empirically based predictions; they have\nno way to gather and evaluate the data required to see if\nsuch predictions are accurate; and the nature of litigation\nand concerns about stare decisis further make it difficult\nfor judges to change course if predictions prove inaccurate.\nNor can judges rely upon local community views and\nvalues when reaching judgments in circumstances where\nprediction is difficult because the basic facts are unclear or\nunknown.\n  At the same time, there is no institutional need to send\njudges off on this “mission-almost-impossible.” Legislators\nare able to “amass the stuff of actual experience and cull\nconclusions from it.” United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S.\n63, 67 (1965). They are far better suited than judges to\nuncover facts and to understand their relevance. And\nlegislators, unlike Article III judges, can be held democ\nratically responsible for their empirically based and value\nladen conclusions. We have thus repeatedly affirmed our\npreference for “legislative not judicial solutions” to this\nkind of problem, see, e.g., Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla.,\n457 U. S. 496, 513 (1982), just as we have repeatedly\naffirmed the Constitution’s preference for democratic\nsolutions legislated by those whom the people elect.\n  In New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 310–\n311 (1932), Justice Brandeis stated in dissent:\n    “Some people assert that our present plight is due, in\n\f16                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n     part, to the limitations set by courts upon experimen\n     tation in the fields of social and economic science; and\n     to the discouragement to which proposals for better\n     ment there have been subjected otherwise. There\n     must be power in the States and the Nation to re\n     mould, through experimentation, our economic prac\n     tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco\n     nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the\n     Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified\n     it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the\n     social problems we face].”\n  There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court\nmay already have refused to take this wise advice with\nrespect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters\nworse here.\n  Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences\nand conditions—both key virtues of federalism—here has\nparticular importance. The incidence of gun ownership\nvaries substantially as between crowded cities and uncon\ngested rural communities, as well as among the different\ngeographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately\n60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated\nWestern States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report\nthat their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of\nadults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode\nIsland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.\n  The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural\ncommunities and cities. Urban centers face significantly\ngreater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural\ncommunities have proportionately greater problems with\nnonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.\nAnd idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find\ning themselves in dramatically different circumstances:\nFor example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times\nhigher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi\nties have historically differed about the need for gun regu\nlation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris\ning that “primarily, and historically,” the law has treated\nthe exercise of police powers, including gun control, as\n“matter[s] of local concern.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes\ndecisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of\nthis particular right does so without strong offsetting\njustification—as the example of Oak Park’s handgun ban\nhelps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §27–2–\n1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,\nafter a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun\nthat his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a\nblanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for\nHandgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak\nPark Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering\ninformation about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000\nsignatures from community residents in support of a ban.\nId., at 21–22. And the village board enacted a ban into\nlaw. Id., at 22.\n   Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board\nheld a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The\ncitizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.\nId., at 22–23. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak\nPark were handguns and that handguns were misused\nmore often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at\n23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the\ncontrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a\nvote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak\nPark now tells us, crime has decreased and the community\nhas seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.\n   Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the\nquestions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na\ntion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak\n\f18                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that\npower from the people? What is it here that the people did\nnot know? What is it that a judge knows better?\n                        *     *    *\n  In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative\ndecisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the\ncomparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,\nthe lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life\nthreatening harm that may flow from striking down regu\nlations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor\nporation of other rights has been at issue, some of these\nproblems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob\nlems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to\nbe present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in\nwhich the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.\nAt the same time, the important factors that favor incor\nporation in other instances—e.g., the protection of broader\nconstitutional objectives—are not present here. The up\nshot is that all factors militate against incorporation—\nwith the possible exception of historical factors.\n                             III\n  I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking\nto justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the\nSecond Amendment protects are “ ‘deeply rooted in this\nNation’s history and tradition.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks\nomitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation’s\nhistory for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.\n  As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only\npertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as\nbroadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here\nare evaluating a more particular right—namely, the right\nto bear arms for purposes of private self-defense—general\nhistorical references to the “right to keep and bear arms”\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nare not always helpful. Depending upon context, early\nhistorical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based\nright—a matter of considerable importance 200 years\nago—which has, as the majority points out, “largely faded\nas a popular concern.” Ante, at 22. There is no reason to\nbelieve that matters of such little contemporary impor\ntance should play a significant role in answering the\nincorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410\n(incorporation “inquiry must focus upon the function\nserved” by the right in question in “contemporary soci\nety”); Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 (1949) (incorpora\ntion must take into account “the movements of a free\nsociety” and “the gradual and empiric process of inclusion\nand exclusion” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §910 (prohibiting federal officeholders\nfrom accepting a “Title, of any kind whatever, from [a]\nforeign State”—presumably a matter of considerable\nimportance 200 years ago).\n   That said, I can find much in the historical record that\nshows that some Americans in some places at certain\ntimes thought it important to keep and bear arms for\nprivate self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that\nmany States have constitutional provisions protecting gun\npossession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions\ntypically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation\nwill be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,\nScrutinizing the Second Amendment, 105 Mich. L. Rev.\n683, 686, 716–717 (2007) (the “courts of every state to\nconsider the question apply a deferential ‘reasonable\nregulation’ standard”) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);\nsee also id., at 716–717 (explaining the difference between\nthat standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is\nthus altogether unclear whether such provisions would\nprohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as\nthe law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The\nmajority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely\n\f20                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with Chicago’s law; and the majority would\nalmost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64) (striking down the District\nof Columbia’s handgun ban).\n   Thus, the specific question before us is not whether\nthere are references to the right to bear arms for self\ndefense throughout this Nation’s history—of course there\nare—or even whether the Court should incorporate a\nsimple constitutional requirement that firearms regula\ntions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear\narms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so\nsubstantial a private self-defense right as the one de\nscribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks\nberg, supra, at 721 (requiring “a careful description” of the\nright at issue when deciding whether it is “deeply rooted\nin this Nation’s history and tradition” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to\nmake up his or her own mind about the historical record\nthat I describe in part below. In my view, that record is\ninsufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private\nself-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the\nsense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi\ndence below shows, States and localities have consistently\nenacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi\nlar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation’s history.\nCourts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,\nat the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor\nporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a\ndifferent right to bear arms than they currently recog\nnize—a right that threatens to destabilize settled state\nlegal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64)\n(rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” similar to\nthat employed by the States).\n   I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to\nwhether the right described by Heller is “fundamental” as\nour incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient historical support for the majority’s conclusion\nthat that right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history\nand tradition.” Instead, I find no more than ambiguity\nand uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians\nwould find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record\nthat is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate\nbasis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and\napplying it against the States.\nThe Eighteenth Century\n   The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th\ncentury evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–32);\nid., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–31); id.,\nat ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–7). In respect\nto the relevant question—the “deeply rooted nature” of a\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense—that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when\naugmented as follows:\n   First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUS-\nTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in\nHeller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted\nprimarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related\nrights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–\n31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written\non the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2–5.\n   Second, historians now tell us that the right to which\nBlackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma\njority’s historical argument, concerned the right of Par\nliament (representing the people) to form a militia to\noppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the\npeople of their traditional liberties (which did not include\nan unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century\nlanguage referring to a “right to keep and bear arms” does\nnot ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense—\ncertainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians’\nBrief 3–27; see also supra, at 2–5.\n\f22                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were\nheavily regulated at the time of the framing—perhaps\nmore heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.\nFor example, one scholar writes that “[h]undreds of indi\nvidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns\nin colonial and early national America.” Churchill, Gun\nRegulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,\n25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat\nutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,\nas well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct\nin Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of\nMassachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, & H. Flanders,\nStatutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.\n108–109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.\n748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162–163 (discuss\ning bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New\nYork).\n  Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several\nStates continued to regulate firearms possession by, for\nexample, adopting rules that would have prevented the\ncarrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5–7) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 59–60). Scholars have thus concluded\nthat the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State’s\npolice power to regulate guns appears to be only that\nregulations were “aimed at a legitimate public purpose”\nand “consistent with reason.” Cornell, Early American\nGun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &\nHist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).\nThe Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century\n   I would also augment the majority’s account of this\nperiod as follows:\n   First, additional States began to regulate the discharge\nof firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,\n§6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          23\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nTerritory 1740 (S. Chase ed. 1835); Act of Dec. 3, 1825, ch.\nCCXCII, §3, 1825 Tenn. Priv. Acts 306.\n   Second, States began to regulate the possession of con\ncealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.\nSee, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early\nRepublic 143–152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also\n1837–1838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200–201 (banning\nthe wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.\nActs ch. 7, §8, p. 110, (“Any free person who shall habitu\nally carry about his person, hidden from common observa\ntion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like\nkind, from the use of which the death of any person might\nprobably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]\nfine not exceed fifty dollars”).\n   State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,\nfinding that, even when the state constitution granted a\nright to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,\n“abolish” these small, inexpensive, “most dangerous weap\nons entirely from use,” even in self-defense. Day v. State,\n37 Tenn. 496, 500 (1857); see also, e.g., State v. Jumel, 13\nLa. Ann. 399, 400 (1858) (upholding concealed weapon ban\nbecause it “prohibited only a particular mode of bearing\narms which is found dangerous to the peace of society”);\nState v. Chandler, 5 La. Ann. 489, 489–490 (1850) (uphold\ning concealed weapon ban and describing the law as “abso\nlutely necessary to counteract a vicious state of society,\ngrowing out of the habit of carrying concealed weapons”);\nState v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616–617 (1840).\nThe Post-Civil War Nineteenth Century\n   It is important to read the majority’s account with the\nfollowing considerations in mind:\n   First, the Court today properly declines to revisit our\ninterpretation of the Privileges or Immunities Clause. See\nante, at 10. The Court’s case for incorporation must thus\nrest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is “fun\n\f24                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndamental.” But the very evidence that it advances in\nsupport of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri\ncans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows\nwith equal force that Americans wanted African-American\ncitizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did\nwhite citizens. Ante, at 22–33. Here, for example is what\nCongress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment\npredecessor, the Second Freedman’s Bureau Act. It wrote\nthat the statute, in order to secure “the constitutional\nright to bear arms . . . for all citizens,” would assure that\neach citizen:\n     “shall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and\n     proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se\n     curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition\n     of estate, real and personal, including the constitu\n     tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all\n     the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re\n     spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.”\n     §14, 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis added).\nThis sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See\nRosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth\nAmendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of\nIncorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383–384\n(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen’s Bureau\nwas focused on discrimination).\n    Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See\n§1, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of “every race and color, without\nregard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\nservitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in\nvarious activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens”). And, of course, the\nFourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar\nantee their citizens the “equal protection of the laws.”\n    There is thus every reason to believe that the funda\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the\neradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new\nsubstantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state\npolice power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 62–69 (discussing congressional record evi\ndence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about\ndiscrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the\nFourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right\nto Southerners who had so recently waged war against the\nNorth, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently\nfreed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,\n§6, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because\nthey were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).\n   Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th\ncentury was common. The majority is correct that the\nFreedmen’s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it\nstands to reason, as the majority points out, that “[i]t\nwould have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee\nthe . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.”\nAnte, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that\nthere existed during this period a fundamental right to\nbear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason\nable exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The\nLimits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun\nRegulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &\nPol’y Rev. 615, 621–622 (2006) (noting that history shows\nthat “nineteenth-century Americans” were “not opposed to\nthe idea that the state should be able to control the use of\nfirearms”).\n   To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a\nnumber of state constitutions adopted or amended after\nthe Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature’s gen\neral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.\nConst., Art. I, §13 (1869) (protecting “the right to keep and\nbear arms,” “under such regulations as the legislature\nmay prescribe”); Idaho Const., Art. I, §11 (1889) (“The\n\f26                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npeople have the right to bear arms . . .; but the Legislature\nshall regulate the exercise of this right by law”); Utah\nConst., Art. I, §6 (1896) (same). And numerous other state\nconstitutional provisions adopted during this period ex\nplicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory\npower over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes\nsional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14–15 (hereinafter\nLegal Historians’ Brief).\n   Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of\nall nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879\nTenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, §1 (prohibiting citizens from\ncarrying “publicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket\npistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or\nnavy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car\nried openly in the hand”); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,\n§1 (forbidding “concealed or ope[n]” bearing of “any fire\narm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,\ntown or village”); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, §1 (pro\nhibiting the “wear[ing] or carry[ng]” of “any pistol . . .\nexcept such pistols as are used in the army or navy,”\nexcept while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12,\n1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless\nthere are “immediate and pressing” reasonable grounds to\nfear “immediate and pressing” attack or for militia ser\nvice). Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols\nand other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians’ Brief 16,\nn. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent\ngun controls, often in response to local conditions—Dodge\nCity, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle\ntowns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger\nous weapons in response to violence accompanying west\nern cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30\n(citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, §XI (Sept. 22,\n1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns\nin America: A Reader 96 (J. Dizard et al. eds. 1999) (dis\ncussing how Western cattle towns required cowboys to\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            27\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n“check” their guns upon entering town).\n  Further, much as they had during the period before the\nCivil War, state courts routinely upheld such restrictions.\nSee, e.g., English v. State, 35 Tex. 473 (1871); Hill v. State,\n53 Ga. 472, 475 (1874); Fife v. State, 31 Ark. 455, 461\n(1876); State v. Workman, 35 W. Va. 367, 373 (1891). The\nTennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on posses\nsion of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons,\nsummarized the Reconstruction understanding of the\nstates’ police power to regulate firearms:\n    “Admitting the right of self-defense in its broadest\n    sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is\n    bound to yield his preference as to the means to be\n    used, to the demands of the public good; and where\n    certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the\n    law of the land, in order to the prevention of [sic]\n    crime—a great public end—no man can be permitted\n    to disregard this general end, and demand of the\n    community the right, in order to gratify his whim or\n    willful desire to use a particular weapon in his par\n    ticular self-defense. The law allows ample means of\n    self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we\n    have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.\n    The object being to banish these weapons from the\n    community by an absolute prohibition for the preven\n    tion of crime, no man’s particular safety, if such case\n    could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.”\n    Andrews v. State, 50 Tenn. 165, 188–189 (1871) (em\n    phasis added).\nThe Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n  Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st\ncentury evidence concerning the Second Amendment at\nany length, I think that it is essential to consider the\nrecent history of the right to bear arms for private self\ndefense when considering whether the right is “fundamen\n\f28                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntal.” To that end, many States now provide state constitu\ntional protection for an individual’s right to keep and bear\narms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep\nand Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191, 205 (2006)\n(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor\ntance of this fact, we should keep the following considera\ntions in mind:\n   First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and\nmany local communities, highly detailed and complicated\nregulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)\nnearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell\nguns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns\nand what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms\nmust be stored and where they may be used; and so on.\nSee generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu\nlating Guns In America (2008), available at http://\nwww.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all\nInternet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available\nin Clerk of Court’s case file) (detailing various arms regu\nlations in every State).\n   Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban\nhandguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the\nright to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, §8–\n20–050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §§27–2–\n1, 27–1–1 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25\n(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico\nban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §12280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.\nStat. Ann. §53–202c (2007); Haw. Rev. Stat. §134–8\n(1993); Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303(a) (Lexis 2002);\nMass. Gen. Laws, ch. 140, §131M (West 2006); N. J. Stat.\nAnn. §2C:39-5 (West Supp. 2010); N. Y. Penal Law Ann.\n§265.02(7) (West Supp. 2008); 25 Laws P. R. Ann. §456m\n(Supp. 2006); see also 18 U. S. C. §922(o) (federal ma\nchinegun ban).\n   Thirteen municipalities do the same. See Albany, N. Y.,\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

And two States,\nMaryland and Hawaii, ban assault pistols. See Haw. Rev.\nStat. Ann. §134–8; Md. Crim. Law Code Ann. §4–303\n(Lexis 2002).\n   Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with\nconstitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni\nformly interpreted those rights as providing protection\nonly against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,\nWinkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the “courts of every state to\nconsider” a gun regulation apply the “ ‘reasonable regula\ntion’ ” approach); State v. McAdams, 714 P. 2d 1236, 1238\n(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v. City & County of Denver, 874\nP. 2d 325, 328 (Colo. 1994).\n   When determining reasonableness those courts have\nnormally adopted a highly deferential attitude towards\nlegislative determinations. See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723\n(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti\ncle’s publication striking down gun control laws: three that\nbanned “the transportation of any firearms for any pur\npose whatsoever,” a single “permitting law,” and two as\napplied challenges in “unusual circumstances”). Hence, as\nevidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States\nand local governments maintain substantial flexibility to\nregulate firearms—much as they seemingly have through\nout the Nation’s history—even in those States with an\narms right in their constitutions.\n\f30                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Although one scholar implies that state courts are less\nwilling to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im\nplementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-\nDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research\nAgenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware\nof no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court\nhas struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a\nparticular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.\n   Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu\ntional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula\ntions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.\nVillage of Morton Grove, 103 Ill. 2d 483, 499, 470 N. E. 2d\n266, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the\narms right is merely a right “to possess some form of\nweapon suitable for self-defense or recreation”); Cleveland\nv. Turner, No. 36126, 1977 WL 201393, *5 (Ohio Ct. App.,\nAug. 4, 1977) (handgun ban “does not absolutely interfere\nwith the right of the people to bear arms, but rather pro\nscribes possession of a specifically defined category of\nhandguns”); State v. Bolin 378 S. C. 96, 99, 662 S. E. 2d\n38, 39 (2008) (ban on handgun possession by persons\nunder 21 did not infringe arms right because they can\n“posses[s] other types of guns”). Thus, the majority’s\ndecision to incorporate the private self-defense right rec\nognized in Heller threatens to alter state regulatory re\ngimes, at least as they pertain to handguns.\n   Third, the plurality correctly points out that only a few\nstate courts, a “paucity” of state courts, have specifically\nupheld handgun bans. Ante, at 39. But which state courts\nhave struck them down? The absence of supporting in\nformation does not help the majority find support. Cf.\nUnited States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496 (1997) (noting\nthat it is “treacherous to find in congressional silence\nalone the adoption of a controlling rule of law” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)). Silence does not show or tend\nto show a consensus that a private self-defense right\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          31\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n(strong enough to strike down a handgun ban) is “deeply\nrooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.”\n                         *   *     *\n   In sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amend\nment in order to protect a private right of armed self\ndefense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the\nright is, or was, “fundamental.” No broader constitutional\ninterest or principle supports legal treatment of that right\nas fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional\nconcerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against\nthat treatment.\n   Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century\nhistory shows a consensus that the right to private armed\nself-defense, as described in Heller, is “deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history or tradition” or is otherwise “funda\nmental.” Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in\nHeller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read\nin the majority’s favor, the historical evidence is at most\nambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for\nits conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of\nself-defense against the States.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n\f32                  MCDONALD v.

Chicago (hereinafter City) and the village of Oak Park, a Chi\n cago suburb, have laws effectively banning handgun possession by\n almost all private citizens. After Heller, petitioners filed this federal\n suit against the City, which was consolidated with two related ac\n tions, alleging that the City’s handgun ban has left them vulnerable\n to criminals. They sought a declaration that the ban and several re\n lated City ordinances violate the Second and Fourteenth Amend\n ments. Rejecting petitioners’ argument that the ordinances are un\n constitutional, the court noted that the Seventh Circuit previously\n had upheld the constitutionality of a handgun ban, that Heller had\n explicitly refrained from opining on whether the Second Amendment\n applied to the States, and that the court had a duty to follow estab\n lished Circuit precedent. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on\n three 19th-century cases—United States v.

CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    teenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amendment right, rec\n    ognized in Heller, to keep and bear arms for the purpose of self\n    defense. Pp. 5–9, 11–19, 19–33.\n       (a) Petitioners base their case on two submissions. Primarily, they\n    argue that the right to keep and bear arms is protected by the Privi\n    leges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that\n    the Slaughter-House Cases’ narrow interpretation of the Clause\n    should now be rejected. As a secondary argument, they contend that\n    the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the\n    Second Amendment right. Chicago and Oak Park (municipal respon\n    dents) maintain that a right set out in the Bill of Rights applies to\n    the States only when it is an indispensable attribute of any “ ‘civi\n    lized’ ” legal system. If it is possible to imagine a civilized country\n    that does not recognize the right, municipal respondents assert, that\n    right is not protected by due process. And since there are civilized\n    countries that ban or strictly regulate the private possession of hand\n    guns, they maintain that due process does not preclude such meas\n    ures. Pp. 4–5.\n       (b) The Bill of Rights, including the Second Amendment, originally\n    applied only to the Federal Government, not to the States, see, e.g.,\n    Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85827\"><a href=\"/opinion/85827/barron-ex-rel-tiernan-v-mayor-of-baltimore/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pet.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247, but the\n    constitutional Amendments adopted in the Civil War’s aftermath\n    fundamentally altered the federal system. Four years after the adop\n    tion of the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court held in the Slaughter-\n    House Cases, that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\n    those rights “which owe their existence to the Federal government,\n    its National character, its Constitution, or its laws,” 16 Wall., at 79,\n    and that the fundamental rights predating the creation of the Fed\n    eral Government were not protected by the Clause, id., at 76. Under\n    this narrow reading, the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities\n    Clause protects only very limited rights. Id., at 79–80. Subse\n    quently, the Court held that the Second Amendment applies only to\n    the Federal Government in Cruikshank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89309\"><a href=\"/opinion/89309/united-states-v-cruikshank/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Presser, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91528\"><a href=\"/opinion/91528/presser-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span>\n    <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93916\"><a href=\"/opinion/93916/miller-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the decisions on which the Sev\n    enth Circuit relied in this case. Pp. 5–9.\n       (c) Whether the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms\n    applies to the States is considered in light of the Court’s precedents\n    applying the Bill of Rights’ protections to the States. Pp. 11–19.\n          (1) In the late 19th century, the Court began to hold that the Due\n    Process Clause prohibits the States from infringing Bill of Rights pro\n    tections. See, e.g., Hurtado v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91054\"><a href=\"/opinion/91054/hurtado-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Five fea\n    tures of the approach taken during the ensuing era are noted. First,\n    the Court viewed the due process question as entirely separate from\n    the question whether a right was a privilege or immunity of national\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U.

New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96885\"><a href=\"/opinion/96885/twining-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99. Second, the\nCourt explained that the only rights due process protected against\nstate infringement were those “of such a nature that they are in\ncluded in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid. Third, some\ncases during this era “can be seen as having asked . . . if a civilized\nsystem could be imagined that would not accord the particular pro\ntection” asserted therein. Duncan v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149,\nn. 14. Fourth, the Court did not hesitate to hold that a Bill of Rights\nguarantee failed to meet the test for Due Process Clause protection,\nfinding, e.g., that freedom of speech and press qualified, Gitlow v.\nNew York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100708\"><a href=\"/opinion/100708/gitlow-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666; Near v. Minnesota ex rel.

Finally, even when such a right was held to fall within\nthe conception of due process, the protection or remedies afforded\nagainst state infringement sometimes differed from those provided\nagainst abridgment by the Federal Government. Pp. 11–13.\n     (2) Justice Black championed the alternative theory that §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated all of the Bill of\nRights’ provisions, see, e.g., Adamson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104455\"><a href=\"/opinion/104455/adamson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71–\n72 (Black, J., dissenting), but the Court never has embraced that the\nory. Pp. 13–15.\n     (3) The Court eventually moved in the direction advocated by\nJustice Black, by adopting a theory of selective incorporation by\nwhich the Due Process Clause incorporates particular rights con\ntained in the first eight Amendments. See, e.g., Gideon v. Wainwright,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106545\"><a href=\"/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 341. These decisions abandoned three of the charac\nteristics of the earlier period. The Court clarified that the governing\nstandard is whether a particular Bill of Rights protection is funda\nmental to our Nation’s particular scheme of ordered liberty and sys\ntem of justice. Duncan, supra, at 149, n. 14. The Court eventually\nheld that almost all of the Bill of Rights’ guarantees met the re\nquirements for protection under the Due Process Clause. The Court\nalso held that Bill of Rights protections must “all . . . be enforced\nagainst the States under the Fourteenth Amendment according to\nthe same standards that protect those personal rights against federal\nencroachment.” Malloy v. Hogan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106862\"><a href=\"/opinion/106862/malloy-v-hogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 10. Under this ap\nproach, the Court overruled earlier decisions holding that particular\nBill of Rights guarantees or remedies did not apply to the States.\nSee, e.g., Gideon, supra, which overruled Betts v. Brady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103694\"><a href=\"/opinion/103694/betts-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Pp. 15–19.\n   (d) The Fourteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment\nright to keep and bear arms fully applicable to the States. Pp. 19–33.\n     (1) The Court must decide whether that right is fundamental to\nthe Nation’s scheme of ordered liberty, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391\n\f4                        MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n    U. S. 145, 149, or, as the Court has said in a related context, whether\n    it is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” Washing\n    ton v. Glucksberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 721. Heller points unmistakably to\n    the answer. Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal\n    systems from ancient times to the present, and the Heller Court held\n    that individual self-defense is “the central component” of the Second\n    Amendment right. 554 U. S., at ___, ___. Explaining that “the need\n    for defense of self, family, and property is most acute” in the home,\n    ibid., the Court found that this right applies to handguns because\n    they are “the most preferred firearm in the nation to ‘keep’ and use\n    for protection of one’s home and family,” id., at ___, ___–___. It thus\n    concluded that citizens must be permitted “to use [handguns] for the\n    core lawful purpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___. Heller also clarifies\n    that this right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradi\n    tions,” Glucksberg, supra, at 721. Heller explored the right’s origins\n    in English law and noted the esteem with which the right was re\n    garded during the colonial era and at the time of the ratification of\n    the Bill of Rights. This is powerful evidence that the right was re\n    garded as fundamental in the sense relevant here. That understand\n    ing persisted in the years immediately following the Bill of Rights’\n    ratification and is confirmed by the state constitutions of that era,\n    which protected the right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 19–22.\n         (2) A survey of the contemporaneous history also demonstrates\n    clearly that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Framers and ratifiers\n    counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental\n    rights necessary to the Nation’s system of ordered liberty. Pp. 22–33.\n            (i) By the 1850’s, the fear that the National Government would\n    disarm the universal militia had largely faded, but the right to keep\n    and bear arms was highly valued for self-defense. Abolitionist au\n    thors wrote in support of the right, and attempts to disarm “Free-\n    Soilers” in “Bloody Kansas,” met with outrage that the constitutional\n    right to keep and bear arms had been taken from the people. After\n    the Civil War, the Southern States engaged in systematic efforts to\n    disarm and injure African Americans, see Heller, supra, at ___.\n    These injustices prompted the 39th Congress to pass the Freedmen’s\n    Bureau Act of 1866 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 to protect the\n    right to keep and bear arms. Congress, however, ultimately deemed\n    these legislative remedies insufficient, and approved the Fourteenth\n    Amendment. Today, it is generally accepted that that Amendment\n    was understood to provide a constitutional basis for protecting the\n    rights set out in the Civil Rights Act. See General Building Contrac\n    tors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110782\"><a href=\"/opinion/110782/general-building-contractors-assn-inc-v-pennsylvania/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389. In Congressional\n    debates on the proposed Amendment, its legislative proponents in the\n    39th Congress referred to the right to keep and bear arms as a fun\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)                     5\n\n                              Syllabus\n\ndamental right deserving of protection. Evidence from the period\nimmediately following the Amendment’s ratification confirms that\nthat right was considered fundamental. Pp. 22–31.\n        (ii) Despite all this evidence, municipal respondents argue that\nMembers of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment as purely an antidiscrimination rule. But while §1 does\ncontain an antidiscrimination rule, i.e., the Equal Protection Clause,\nit can hardly be said that the section does no more than prohibit dis\ncrimination. If what municipal respondents mean is that the Second\nAmendment should be singled out for special—and specially unfavor\nable—treatment, the Court rejects the suggestion. The right to keep\nand bear arms must be regarded as a substantive guarantee, not a\nprohibition that could be ignored so long as the States legislated in\nan evenhanded manner. Pp. 30–33.\n   JUSTICE ALITO, joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and\nJUSTICE KENNEDY, concluded, in Parts II–C, IV, and V, that the Four\nteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause incorporates the Second\nAmendment right recognized in Heller. Pp. 10–11, 33–44.\n   (a) Petitioners argue that that the Second Amendment right is one\nof the “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”\nThere is no need to reconsider the Court’s interpretation of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause in the Slaughter-House Cases because,\nfor many decades, the Court has analyzed the question whether par\nticular rights are protected against state infringement under the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. Pp. 10–11.\n   (b) Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are rejected be\ncause they are at war with Heller’s central holding. In effect, they\nask the Court to hold the right to keep and bear arms as subject to a\ndifferent body of rules for incorporation than the other Bill of Rights\nguarantees.

A City ordinance provides that “[n]o person\nshall . . . possess . . . any firearm unless such person is the\nholder of a valid registration certificate for such firearm.”\nChicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–040(a) (2009). The\nCode then prohibits registration of most handguns, thus\neffectively banning handgun possession by almost all\nprivate citizens who reside in the City. §8–20–050(c).\nLike Chicago, Oak Park makes it “unlawful for any person\nto possess . . . any firearm,” a term that includes “pistols,\nrevolvers, guns and small arms . . . commonly known as\nhandguns.” Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1\n(2007), 27–1–1 (2009).\n   Chicago enacted its handgun ban to protect its residents\n“from the loss of property and injury or death from fire\narms.” See Chicago, Ill., Journal of Proceedings of the\nCity Council, p. 10049 (Mar. 19, 1982). The Chicago peti\ntioners and their amici, however, argue that the handgun\nban has left them vulnerable to criminals. Chicago Police\nDepartment statistics, we are told, reveal that the City’s\nhandgun murder rate has actually increased since the ban\nwas enacted1 and that Chicago residents now face one of\nthe highest murder rates in the country and rates of other\nviolent crimes that exceed the average in comparable\ncities.2\n——————\n  1 See Brief for Heartland Institute as Amicus Curiae 6–7 (noting that\n\nhandgun murder rate was 9.65 in 1983 and 13.88 in 2008).\n  2 Brief for Buckeye Firearms Foundation, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae\n\n8–9 (“In 2002 and again in 2008, Chicago had more murders than any\nother city in the U.

Colleen Lawson is a Chicago resi\ndent whose home has been targeted by burglars. “In Mrs.\nLawson’s judgment, possessing a handgun in Chicago\nwould decrease her chances of suffering serious injury or\ndeath should she ever be threatened again in her home.”3\nMcDonald, Lawson, and the other Chicago petitioners own\nhandguns that they store outside of the city limits, but\nthey would like to keep their handguns in their homes for\nprotection.

If it is possible to imagine a civilized country that\ndoes not recognize the right, the municipal respondents\ntell us, then that right is not protected by due process.\nIbid.

The provision at issue in this case, §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, provides, among other\nthings, that a State may not abridge “the privileges or\nimmunities of citizens of the United States” or deprive\n“any person of life, liberty, or property, without due proc\ness of law.”\n   Four years after the adoption of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, this Court was asked to interpret the\nAmendment’s reference to “the privileges or immunities of\ncitizens of the United States.” The Slaughter-House\nCases, supra, involved challenges to a Louisiana law per\nmitting the creation of a state-sanctioned monopoly on the\nbutchering of animals within the city of New Orleans.\nJustice Samuel Miller’s opinion for the Court concluded\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects only\nthose rights “which owe their existence to the Federal\ngovernment, its National character, its Constitution, or its\nlaws.” Id., at 79. The Court held that other fundamental\nrights—rights that predated the creation of the Federal\nGovernment and that “the State governments were cre\nated to establish and secure”—were not protected by the\nClause. Id., at 76.\n   In drawing a sharp distinction between the rights of\nfederal and state citizenship, the Court relied on two\nprincipal arguments. First, the Court emphasized that\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\nClause spoke of “the privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States,” and the Court contrasted this phrasing\nwith the wording in the first sentence of the Fourteenth\nAmendment and in the Privileges and Immunities Clause\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

Second, the Court stated that a con\ntrary reading would “radically chang[e] the whole theory\nof the relations of the State and Federal governments to\neach other and of both these governments to the people,”\nand the Court refused to conclude that such a change had\nbeen made “in the absence of language which expresses\nsuch a purpose too clearly to admit of doubt.” Id., at 78.\nFinding the phrase “privileges or immunities of citizens of\nthe United States” lacking by this high standard, the\nCourt reasoned that the phrase must mean something\nmore limited.\n  Under the Court’s narrow reading, the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause protects such things as the right\n     “to come to the seat of government to assert any claim\n     [a citizen] may have upon that government, to trans\n     act any business he may have with it, to seek its pro\n     tection, to share its offices, to engage in administering\n     its functions . . . [and to] become a citizen of any State\n     of the Union by a bonâ fide residence therein, with the\n     same rights as other citizens of that State.” Id., at\n     79–80 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Finding no constitutional protection against state intru\nsion of the kind envisioned by the Louisiana statute, the\nCourt upheld the statute. Four Justices dissented. Jus\ntice Field, joined by Chief Justice Chase and Justices\nSwayne and Bradley, criticized the majority for reducing\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\n——————\n   5 The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment makes “[a]ll per\n\nsons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the juris\ndiction thereof . . . citizens of the United States and of the State wherein\nthey reside.” (Emphasis added.) The Privileges and Immunities Clause\nof Article IV provides that “[t]he Citizens of each State shall be entitled\nto all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.”\n(Emphasis added.)\n\f8                  MCDONALD v.

Id., at 96–97. Justice Bradley’s dis\nsent observed that “we are not bound to resort to implica\ntion . . . to find an authoritative declaration of some of the\nmost important privileges and immunities of citizens of\nthe United States. It is in the Constitution itself.” Id., at\n118. Justice Bradley would have construed the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause to include those rights enumerated\nin the Constitution as well as some unenumerated rights.\nId., at 119.

CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n                     Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n                              C\n   As previously noted, the Seventh Circuit concluded that\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller doomed petitioners’\nclaims at the Court of Appeals level. Petitioners argue,\nhowever, that we should overrule those decisions and hold\nthat the right to keep and bear arms is one of the “privi\nleges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” In\npetitioners’ view, the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprotects all of the rights set out in the Bill of Rights, as\nwell as some others, see Brief for Petitioners 10, 14, 15–21,\nbut petitioners are unable to identify the Clause’s full\nscope, Tr. of Oral Arg. 5–6, 8–11. Nor is there any consen\nsus on that question among the scholars who agree that\nthe Slaughter-House Cases’ interpretation is flawed. See\nSaenz, supra, at 522, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., dissenting).\n   We see no need to reconsider that interpretation here.\nFor many decades, the question of the rights protected by\nthe Fourteenth Amendment against state infringement\nhas been analyzed under the Due Process Clause of that\nAmendment and not under the Privileges or Immunities\nClause. We therefore decline to disturb the Slaughter-\nHouse holding.\n   At the same time, however, this Court’s decisions in\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller do not preclude us from\nconsidering whether the Due Process Clause of the Four\nteenth Amendment makes the Second Amendment right\nbinding on the States. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___, n. 23\n(slip op., at 48, n. 23). None of those cases “engage[d] in\nthe sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by\nour later cases.” Ibid. As explained more fully below,\nCruikshank, Presser, and Miller all preceded the era in\nwhich the Court began the process of “selective incorpo\nration” under the Due Process Clause, and we have never\npreviously addressed the question whether the right to\nkeep and bear arms applies to the States under that\ntheory.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           11\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\n   Indeed, Cruikshank has not prevented us from holding\nthat other rights that were at issue in that case are bind\ning on the States through the Due Process Clause. In\nCruikshank, the Court held that the general “right of the\npeople peaceably to assemble for lawful purposes,” which\nis protected by the First Amendment, applied only against\nthe Federal Government and not against the States. See\n92 U. S., at 551–552. Nonetheless, over 60 years later the\nCourt held that the right of peaceful assembly was a “fun\ndamental righ[t] . . . safeguarded by the due process clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.” De Jonge v. Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102728\"><a href=\"/opinion/102728/de-jonge-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (1937). We follow the same path here and\nthus consider whether the right to keep and bear arms\napplies to the States under the Due Process Clause.\n                              D\n                               1\n  In the late 19th century, the Court began to consider\nwhether the Due Process Clause prohibits the States from\ninfringing rights set out in the Bill of Rights. See Hurtado\nv.

Five features of the approach\ntaken during the ensuing era should be noted.\n  First, the Court viewed the due process question as\nentirely separate from the question whether a right was a\nprivilege or immunity of national citizenship. See Twin\ning v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96885\"><a href=\"/opinion/96885/twining-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 (1908).\n  Second, the Court explained that the only rights pro\ntected against state infringement by the Due Process\nClause were those rights “of such a nature that they are\nincluded in the conception of due process of law.” Ibid.\nSee also, e.g., Adamson v.

For example, in Twining, the\nCourt referred to “immutable principles of justice which\ninhere in the very idea of free government which no mem\nber of the Union may disregard.” 211 U. S., at 102 (inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). In Snyder v. Massachu\nsetts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102189\"><a href=\"/opinion/102189/snyder-v-massachusetts/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (1934), the Court spoke of rights\nthat are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our\npeople as to be ranked as fundamental.” And in Palko, the\nCourt famously said that due process protects those rights\nthat are “the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty”\nand essential to “a fair and enlightened system of justice.”\n302 U. S., at 325.\n   Third, in some cases decided during this era the Court\n“can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into\nwhether some particular procedural safeguard was re\nquired of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined\nthat would not accord the particular protection.” Duncan\nv. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149, n. 14 (1968). Thus, in\nholding that due process prohibits a State from taking\nprivate property without just compensation, the Court\ndescribed the right as “a principle of natural equity, rec\nognized by all temperate and civilized governments, from\na deep and universal sense of its justice.” Chicago, B. &\nQ. R. Co., supra, at 238. Similarly, the Court found that\ndue process did not provide a right against compelled\nincrimination in part because this right “has no place in\nthe jurisprudence of civilized and free countries outside\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

The Court found that some such\nrights qualified. See, e.g., Gitlow v. New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100708\"><a href=\"/opinion/100708/gitlow-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1925) (freedom of speech and press); Near v.\nMinnesota ex rel.

See, e.g., Hurtado, supra (grand jury\nindictment requirement); Twining, supra (privilege\nagainst self-incrimination).\n    Finally, even when a right set out in the Bill of Rights\nwas held to fall within the conception of due process, the\nprotection or remedies afforded against state infringement\nsometimes differed from the protection or remedies pro\nvided against abridgment by the Federal Government. To\ngive one example, in Betts the Court held that, although\nthe Sixth Amendment required the appointment of coun\nsel in all federal criminal cases in which the defendant\nwas unable to retain an attorney, the Due Process Clause\nrequired appointment of counsel in state criminal proceed\nings only where “want of counsel in [the] particular case\n. . . result[ed] in a conviction lacking in . . . fundamental\nfairness.” 316 U. S., at 473. Similarly, in Wolf v. Colo\nrado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104709\"><a href=\"/opinion/104709/wolf-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1949), the Court held that the “core of\nthe Fourth Amendment” was implicit in the concept of\nordered liberty and thus “enforceable against the States\nthrough the Due Process Clause” but that the exclusionary\nrule, which applied in federal cases, did not apply to the\nStates. Id., at 27–28, 33.\n                          2\n  An alternative theory regarding the relationship be\n\f14                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ntween the Bill of Rights and §1 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment was championed by Justice Black. This theory held\nthat §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment totally incorporated\nall of the provisions of the Bill of Rights. See, e.g.,\nAdamson, supra, at 71–72 (Black, J., dissenting); Duncan,\nsupra, at 166 (Black, J., concurring). As Justice Black\nnoted, the chief congressional proponents of the Four\nteenth Amendment espoused the view that the Amend\nment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States and,\nin so doing, overruled this Court’s decision in Barron.9\nAdamson, 332 U. S., at 72 (dissenting opinion).10 None\n——————\n  9 Senator Jacob Howard, who spoke on behalf of the Joint Committee\n\non Reconstruction and sponsored the Amendment in the Senate, stated\nthat the Amendment protected all of “the personal rights guarantied\nand secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution.” Cong.\nGlobe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765 (1866) (hereinafter 39th Cong.\nGlobe). Representative John Bingham, the principal author of the text\nof §1, said that the Amendment would “arm the Congress . . . with the\npower to enforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution\ntoday.” Id., at 1088; see also id., at 1089–1090; A. Amar, The Bill of\nRights: Creation and Reconstruction 183 (1998) (hereinafter Amar, Bill\nof Rights). After ratification of the Amendment, Bingham maintained\nthe view that the rights guaranteed by §1 of the Fourteenth Amend\nment “are chiefly defined in the first eight amendments to the Consti\ntution of the United States.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 84\n(1871). Finally, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, the political leader\nof the House and acting chairman of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction, stated during the debates on the Amendment that “the\nConstitution limits only the action of Congress, and is not a limitation\non the States. This amendment supplies that defect, and allows Con\ngress to correct the unjust legislation of the States.” 39th Cong. Globe\n2459; see also M. Curtis, No State Shall Abridge: The Fourteenth\nAmendment and the Bill of Rights 112 (1986) (counting at least 30\nstatements during the debates in Congress interpreting §1 to incorpo\nrate the Bill of Rights); Brief for Constitutional Law Professors as\nAmici Curiae 20 (collecting authorities and stating that “[n]ot a single\nsenator or representative disputed [the incorporationist] understand\ning” of the Fourteenth Amendment).\n  10 The municipal respondents and some of their amici dispute the\n\nsignificance of these statements.

But that ruling was the\nresult of an unusual division among the Justices, not an endorsement\nof the two-track approach to incorporation. In Apodaca, eight Justices\nagreed that the Sixth Amendment applies identically to both the\nFederal Government and the States. See Johnson, supra, at 395\n(Brennan, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, among those eight, four Jus\ntices took the view that the Sixth Amendment does not require unani\nmous jury verdicts in either federal or state criminal trials, Apodaca,\n406 U.

Justice\nPowell’s concurrence in the judgment broke the tie, and he concluded\nthat the Sixth Amendment requires juror unanimity in federal, but not\nstate, cases.     Apodaca, therefore, does not undermine the well\nestablished rule that incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply\nidentically to the States and the Federal Government.

Thus, we concluded, citizens\nmust be permitted “to use [handguns] for the core lawful\npurpose of self-defense.” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 58).\n   Heller makes it clear that this right is “deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition.” Glucksberg, supra, at\n721 (internal quotation marks omitted). Heller explored\nthe right’s origins, noting that the 1689 English Bill of\nRights explicitly protected a right to keep arms for self\ndefense, 554 U.

As we noted in Heller, King George III’s attempt\nto disarm the colonists in the 1760’s and 1770’s “provoked\npolemical reactions by Americans invoking their rights as\nEnglishmen to keep arms.”16 Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21);\nsee also L.

Fed\neralists responded, not by arguing that the right was\ninsufficiently important to warrant protection but by\ncontending that the right was adequately protected by the\nConstitution’s assignment of only limited powers to the\nFederal Government. Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 25–\n26); cf. The Federalist No. 46, p. 296 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)\n(J. Madison). Thus, Antifederalists and Federalists alike\nagreed that the right to bear arms was fundamental to the\nnewly formed system of government. See Levy 143–149;\nJ. Malcolm, To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an\nAnglo-American Right 155–164 (1994). But those who\nwere fearful that the new Federal Government would\ninfringe traditional rights such as the right to keep and\nbear arms insisted on the adoption of the Bill of Rights as\na condition for ratification of the Constitution. See 1 J.\nElliot, The Debates in the Several State Conventions on\nthe Adoption of the Federal Constitution 327–331 (2d ed.\n1854); 3 id., at 657–661; 4 id., at 242–246, 248–249; see\nalso Levy 26–34; A. Kelly & W. Harbison, The American\nConstitution: Its Origins and Development 110, 118 (7th\ned. 1991). This is surely powerful evidence that the right\nwas regarded as fundamental in the sense relevant here.\n   This understanding persisted in the years immediately\nfollowing the ratification of the Bill of Rights.

Founding-era\nlegal commentators confirmed the importance of the right\nto early Americans. St. George Tucker, for example, de\nscribed the right to keep and bear arms as “the true palla\ndium of liberty” and explained that prohibitions on the\nright would place liberty “on the brink of destruction.” 1\nBlackstone’s Commentaries, Editor’s App. 300 (S. Tucker\ned. 1803); see also W. Rawle, A View of the Constitution of\nthe United States of America, 125–126 (2d ed. 1829) (re\nprint 2009); 3 J.

Its\nefforts to safeguard the right to keep and bear arms\ndemonstrate that the right was still recognized to be\nfundamental.\n   The most explicit evidence of Congress’ aim appears in\n§14 of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which provided\nthat “the right . . . to have full and equal benefit of all laws\nand proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal\nsecurity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition of\nestate, real and personal, including the constitutional\nright to bear arms, shall be secured to and enjoyed by all\nthe citizens . . . without respect to race or color, or previ\nous condition of slavery.” 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis\nadded).22 Section 14 thus explicitly guaranteed that “all\nthe citizens,” black and white, would have “the constitu\ntional right to bear arms.”\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27, which was\nconsidered at the same time as the Freedmen’s Bureau\nAct, similarly sought to protect the right of all citizens to\nkeep and bear arms.23 Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act\n——————\ncally interfered with.” Joint Committee on Reconstruction, H.

Globe 654\n(Rep. Thomas Eliot), even though at least some Members believed that\nthe unamended version alone would have protected the right, see id., at\n743 (Sen.

In introducing the bill, Senator Trumbull described its\npurpose as securing to blacks the “privileges which are essential to\nfreemen.” Id., at 474. He then pointed to the previously described\nMississippi law that “prohibit[ed] any negro or mulatto from having\nfire-arms” and explained that the bill would “destroy” such laws.

This language was vir\ntually identical to language in §14 of the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, 14 Stat. 176–177 (“the right . . . to have full\nand equal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning\npersonal liberty, personal security, and the acquisition,\nenjoyment, and disposition of estate, real and personal”).\nAnd as noted, the latter provision went on to explain that\none of the “laws and proceedings concerning personal\nliberty, personal security, and the acquisition, enjoyment,\nand disposition of estate, real and personal” was “the\nconstitutional right to bear arms.” Ibid. Representative\nBingham believed that the Civil Rights Act protected the\nsame rights as enumerated in the Freedmen’s Bureau bill,\nwhich of course explicitly mentioned the right to keep and\nbear arms. 39th Cong. Globe 1292. The unavoidable\nconclusion is that the Civil Rights Act, like the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, aimed to protect “the constitutional right to\nbear arms” and not simply to prohibit discrimination. See\nalso Amar, Bill of Rights 264–265 (noting that one of the\n“core purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and of the\nFourteenth Amendment was to redress the grievances” of\nfreedmen who had been stripped of their arms and to\n“affirm the full and equal right of every citizen to self\ndefense”).\n   Congress, however, ultimately deemed these legislative\n\n——————\nof the Federal Government, that the ‘reconstructed’ State authorities of\nMississippi were allowed to rob and disarm our veteran soldiers and\narm the rebels fresh from the field of treasonable strife.

Globe, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., 1967. And in debating\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress routinely referred to\nthe right to keep and bear arms and decried the continued\ndisarmament of blacks in the South. See Halbrook,\nFreedmen 120–131. Finally, legal commentators from the\nperiod emphasized the fundamental nature of the right.\nSee, e.g., T. Farrar, Manual of the Constitution of the\nUnited States of America §118, p. 145 (1867) (reprint\n1993); J. Pomeroy, An Introduction to the Constitutional\nLaw of the United States §239, pp. 152–153 (3d ed. 1875).\n  The right to keep and bear arms was also widely pro\ntected by state constitutions at the time when the Four\nteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\n——————\n    25 Other Members of the 39th Congress stressed the importance of the\n\nright to keep and bear arms in discussing other measures. In speaking\ngenerally on reconstruction, Representative Roswell Hart listed the\n“ ‘right of the people to keep and bear arms’ ” as among those rights\nnecessary to a “republican form of government.” 39th Cong.

Const., Art. I, §15 (1868); Tex. Const., Art. I,\n§13 (1869).

They argue\nthat Members of Congress overwhelmingly viewed §1 of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment “as an antidiscrimination\nrule,” and they cite statements to the effect that the sec\ntion would outlaw discriminatory measures. Id., at 64.\nThis argument is implausible.\n   First, while §1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contains\n“an antidiscrimination rule,” namely, the Equal Protection\nClause, municipal respondents can hardly mean that §1\ndoes no more than prohibit discrimination. If that were\nso, then the First Amendment, as applied to the States,\nwould not prohibit nondiscriminatory abridgments of the\nrights to freedom of speech or freedom of religion; the\nFourth Amendment, as applied to the States, would not\nprohibit all unreasonable searches and seizures but only\ndiscriminatory searches and seizures—and so on. We\nassume that this is not municipal respondents’ view, so\nwhat they must mean is that the Second Amendment\nshould be singled out for special—and specially unfavor\nable—treatment. We reject that suggestion.\n   Second, municipal respondents’ argument ignores the\n——————\n36, 42).\n\f32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n\nclear terms of the Freedmen’s Bureau Act of 1866, which\nacknowledged the existence of the right to bear arms. If\nthat law had used language such as “the equal benefit of\nlaws concerning the bearing of arms,” it would be possible\nto interpret it as simply a prohibition of racial discrimina\ntion. But §14 speaks of and protects “the constitutional\nright to bear arms,” an unmistakable reference to the\nright protected by the Second Amendment. And it pro\ntects the “full and equal benefit” of this right in the States.\n14 Stat. 176–177. It would have been nonsensical for\nCongress to guarantee the full and equal benefit of a\nconstitutional right that does not exist.\n   Third, if the 39th Congress had outlawed only those\nlaws that discriminate on the basis of race or previous\ncondition of servitude, African Americans in the South\nwould likely have remained vulnerable to attack by many\nof their worst abusers: the state militia and state peace\nofficers. In the years immediately following the Civil War,\na law banning the possession of guns by all private citi\nzens would have been nondiscriminatory only in the for\nmal sense. Any such law—like the Chicago and Oak Park\nordinances challenged here—presumably would have\npermitted the possession of guns by those acting under the\nauthority of the State and would thus have left firearms in\nthe hands of the militia and local peace officers. And as\nthe Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction\nrevealed, see supra, at 24–25, those groups were widely\ninvolved in harassing blacks in the South.\n   Fourth, municipal respondents’ purely antidiscrimina\ntion theory of the Fourteenth Amendment disregards the\nplight of whites in the South who opposed the Black\nCodes. If the 39th Congress and the ratifying public had\nsimply prohibited racial discrimination with respect to the\nbearing of arms, opponents of the Black Codes would have\nbeen left without the means of self-defense—as had aboli\ntionists in Kansas in the 1850’s.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

See 39th Cong. Globe 914; Halbrook, Freedmen,\nsupra, 20–21. Disarmament, it was argued, would violate\nthe members’ right to bear arms, and it was ultimately\ndecided to disband the militias but not to disarm their\nmembers. See Act of Mar. 2, 1867, §6, 14 Stat. 485, 487;\nHalbrook, Freedmen 68–69; Cramer 858–861. It cannot\nbe doubted that the right to bear arms was regarded as a\nsubstantive guarantee, not a prohibition that could be\nignored so long as the States legislated in an evenhanded\nmanner.\n                             IV\n  Municipal respondents’ remaining arguments are at war\nwith our central holding in Heller: that the Second\nAmendment protects a personal right to keep and bear\narms for lawful purposes, most notably for self-defense\nwithin the home. Municipal respondents, in effect, ask us\nto treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class\nright, subject to an entirely different body of rules than\nthe other Bill of Rights guarantees that we have held to be\nincorporated into the Due Process Clause.\n  Municipal respondents’ main argument is nothing less\nthan a plea to disregard 50 years of incorporation prece\ndent and return (presumably for this case only) to a by\ngone era. Municipal respondents submit that the Due\nProcess Clause protects only those rights “ ‘recognized by\nall temperate and civilized governments, from a deep and\nuniversal sense of [their] justice.’ ” Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 9 (quoting Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 166 U. S.,\nat 238). According to municipal respondents, if it is possi\nble to imagine any civilized legal system that does not\nrecognize a particular right, then the Due Process Clause\n\f34                     MCDONALD v.

Consider the exclusionary rule. Although the\nexclusionary rule “is not an individual right,” Herring v.\nUnited States, 555 U.

Brief for\nMunicipal Respondents 23–31. In Heller, however, we\nexpressly rejected the argument that the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right should be determined by judicial\ninterest balancing, 554 U. S., at ___–___ (slip op., at 62–\n63), and this Court decades ago abandoned “the notion\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only\na watered-down, subjective version of the individual guar\nantees of the Bill of Rights,” Malloy, supra, at 10–11 (in\nternal quotation marks omitted).\n   As evidence that the Fourteenth Amendment has not\nhistorically been understood to restrict the authority of the\nStates to regulate firearms, municipal respondents and\nsupporting amici cite a variety of state and local firearms\nlaws that courts have upheld. But what is most striking\nabout their research is the paucity of precedent sustaining\nbans comparable to those at issue here and in Heller.\nMunicipal respondents cite precisely one case (from the\nlate 20th century) in which such a ban was sustained. See\nBrief for Municipal Respondents 26–27 (citing Kalodimos\nv. Morton Grove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022759/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022759/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984));\nsee also Reply Brief for Respondents NRA et al. 23, n. 7\n(asserting that no other court has ever upheld a complete\nban on the possession of handguns). It is important to\nkeep in mind that Heller, while striking down a law that\nprohibited the possession of handguns in the home, recog\nnized that the right to keep and bear arms is not “a right\nto keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner\nwhatsoever and for whatever purpose.” 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 54). We made it clear in Heller that our hold\ning did not cast doubt on such longstanding regulatory\nmeasures as “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by\nfelons and the mentally ill,” “laws forbidding the carrying\n\f40                 MCDONALD v.

We repeat those assurances here.\nDespite municipal respondents’ doomsday proclamations,\nincorporation does not imperil every law regulating\nfirearms.\n   Municipal respondents argue, finally, that the right to\nkeep and bear arms is unique among the rights set out in\nthe first eight Amendments “because the reason for codify\ning the Second Amendment (to protect the militia) differs\nfrom the purpose (primarily, to use firearms to engage in\nself-defense) that is claimed to make the right implicit in\nthe concept of ordered liberty.” Brief for Municipal Re\nspondents 36–37. Municipal respondents suggest that the\nSecond Amendment right differs from the rights hereto\nfore incorporated because the latter were “valued for\n[their] own sake.” Id., at 33. But we have never previ\nously suggested that incorporation of a right turns on\nwhether it has intrinsic as opposed to instrumental value,\nand quite a few of the rights previously held to be incorpo\nrated—for example the right to counsel and the right to\nconfront and subpoena witnesses—are clearly instrumen\ntal by any measure. Moreover, this contention repackages\none of the chief arguments that we rejected in Heller, i.e.,\nthat the scope of the Second Amendment right is defined\nby the immediate threat that led to the inclusion of that\nright in the Bill of Rights. In Heller, we recognized that\nthe codification of this right was prompted by fear that the\nFederal Government would disarm and thus disable the\nmilitias, but we rejected the suggestion that the right was\nvalued only as a means of preserving the militias. 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26). On the contrary, we stressed\nthat the right was also valued because the possession of\nfirearms was thought to be essential for self-defense. As\nwe put it, self-defense was “the central component of the\n\f                   Cite as: 561 U.

S., at 24 (Harlan, J., dissenting)).\nThe question presented in this case, in his view, “is\nwhether the particular right asserted by petitioners ap\nplies to the States because of the Fourteenth Amendment\nitself, standing on its own bottom.” Post, at 27. He would\nhold that “[t]he rights protected against state infringe\nment by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause\nneed not be identical in shape or scope to the rights pro\ntected against Federal Government infringement by the\nvarious provisions of the Bill of Rights.” Post, at 9.\n   As we have explained, the Court, for the past half\ncentury, has moved away from the two-track approach. If\nwe were now to accept JUSTICE STEVENS’ theory across the\nboard, decades of decisions would be undermined. We\nassume that this is not what is proposed. What is urged\ninstead, it appears, is that this theory be revived solely for\nthe individual right that Heller recognized, over vigorous\ndissents.\n   The relationship between the Bill of Rights’ guarantees\nand the States must be governed by a single, neutral\nprinciple. It is far too late to exhume what Justice Bren\nnan, writing for the Court 46 years ago, derided as “the\nnotion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the\nStates only a watered-down, subjective version of the\nindividual guarantees of the Bill of Rights.” Malloy,\nsupra, at 10–11 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f42                MCDONALD v.

To begin, while there is certainly room\nfor disagreement about Heller’s analysis of the history of\nthe right to keep and bear arms, nothing written since\nHeller persuades us to reopen the question there decided.\nFew other questions of original meaning have been as\nthoroughly explored.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s conclusion that the Fourteenth\nAmendment does not incorporate the right to keep and\nbear arms appears to rest primarily on four factors: First,\n“there is no popular consensus” that the right is funda\nmental, post, at 9; second, the right does not protect mi\nnorities or persons neglected by those holding political\npower, post, at 10; third, incorporation of the Second\nAmendment right would “amount to a significant incur\nsion on a traditional and important area of state concern,\naltering the constitutional relationship between the States\nand the Federal Government” and preventing local varia\ntions, post, at 11; and fourth, determining the scope of the\nSecond Amendment right in cases involving state and\nlocal laws will force judges to answer difficult empirical\nquestions regarding matters that are outside their area of\nexpertise, post, at 11–16. Even if we believed that these\nfactors were relevant to the incorporation inquiry, none of\nthese factors undermines the case for incorporation of the\nright to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n   First, we have never held that a provision of the Bill of\nRights applies to the States only if there is a “popular\nconsensus” that the right is fundamental, and we see no\nbasis for such a rule. But in this case, as it turns out,\nthere is evidence of such a consensus. An amicus brief\nsubmitted by 58 Members of the Senate and 251 Members\nof the House of Representatives urges us to hold that the\nright to keep and bear arms is fundamental. See Brief for\nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison et al. as Amici Curiae 4.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Brief for State of Texas et al. as Amici Curiae 6.\n  Second, petitioners and many others who live in high\ncrime areas dispute the proposition that the Second\nAmendment right does not protect minorities and those\nlacking political clout. The plight of Chicagoans living in\nhigh-crime areas was recently highlighted when two Illi\nnois legislators representing Chicago districts called on\nthe Governor to deploy the Illinois National Guard to\npatrol the City’s streets.31 The legislators noted that the\nnumber of Chicago homicide victims during the current\nyear equaled the number of American soldiers killed dur\ning that same period in Afghanistan and Iraq and that\n80% of the Chicago victims were black.32 Amici supporting\nincorporation of the right to keep and bear arms contend\nthat the right is especially important for women and\nmembers of other groups that may be especially vulner\nable to violent crime.33 If, as petitioners believe, their\nsafety and the safety of other law-abiding members of the\ncommunity would be enhanced by the possession of hand\nguns in the home for self-defense, then the Second\nAmendment right protects the rights of minorities and\nother residents of high-crime areas whose needs are not\nbeing met by elected public officials.\n——————\n  31 See Mack & Burnette, 2 Lawmakers to Quinn: Send the Guard to\n\nChicago, Chicago Tribune, Apr. 26, 2010, p. 6.\n  32 Janssen & Knowles, Send in Troops?

CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of the Court\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\n   Third, JUSTICE BREYER is correct that incorporation of\nthe Second Amendment right will to some extent limit the\nlegislative freedom of the States, but this is always true\nwhen a Bill of Rights provision is incorporated. Incorpora\ntion always restricts experimentation and local variations,\nbut that has not stopped the Court from incorporating\nvirtually every other provision of the Bill of Rights. “[T]he\nenshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes\ncertain policy choices off the table.” Heller, 554 U. S., at __\n(slip op., at 64). This conclusion is no more remarkable\nwith respect to the Second Amendment than it is with\nrespect to all the other limitations on state power found in\nthe Constitution.\n   Finally, JUSTICE BREYER is incorrect that incorporation\nwill require judges to assess the costs and benefits of\nfirearms restrictions and thus to make difficult empirical\njudgments in an area in which they lack expertise. As we\nhave noted, while his opinion in Heller recommended an\ninterest-balancing test, the Court specifically rejected that\nsuggestion. See supra, at 38–39. “The very enumeration\nof the right takes out of the hands of government—even\nthe Third Branch of Government—the power to decide on\na case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth\ninsisting upon.” Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 62–63).\n                        *    *    *\n  In Heller, we held that the Second Amendment protects\nthe right to possess a handgun in the home for the purpose\nof self-defense. Unless considerations of stare decisis\ncounsel otherwise, a provision of the Bill of Rights that\nprotects a right that is fundamental from an American\nperspective applies equally to the Federal Government\nand the States. See Duncan, 391 U. S., at 149, and n. 14.\nWe therefore hold that the Due Process Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the Second Amend\nment right recognized in Heller.

Plenty indeed—and\nthat alone is a problem. The ability of omnidirectional\nguideposts to constrain is inversely proportional to their\nnumber.

His interpretive\n\napproach applied to incorporation of the Second Amendment includes\nconsideration of such factors as “the extent to which incorporation will\nfurther other, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the extent\nto which incorporation will advance or hinder the Constitution’s struc­\ntural aims”; whether recognizing a particular right will “further the\nConstitution’s effort to ensure that the government treats each individ­\nual with equal respect” or will “help maintain the democratic form of\ngovernment”; whether it is “inconsistent . . . with the Constitution’s\nefforts to create governmental institutions well suited to the carrying\nout of its constitutional promises”; whether it fits with “the Framers’\nbasic reason for believing the Court ought to have the power of judicial\nreview”; courts’ comparative advantage in answering empirical ques­\ntions that may be involved in applying the right; and whether there is a\n“strong offsetting justification” for removing a decision from the democ­\nratic process.

Moreover, trusting the meaning\nof the Due Process Clause to what has historically been\nprotected is circular, see post, at 19, since that would\nmean no new rights could get in.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS moves on to the “most basic” con­\nstraint on subjectivity his theory offers: that he would\n“esche[w] attempts to provide any all-purpose, top-down,\ntotalizing theory of ‘liberty.’ ” Post, at 22. The notion that\nthe absence of a coherent theory of the Due Process Clause\nwill somehow curtail judicial caprice is at war with reason.\nIndeterminacy means opportunity for courts to impose\nwhatever rule they like; it is the problem, not the solution.\nThe idea that interpretive pluralism would reduce courts’\nability to impose their will on the ignorant masses is not\nmerely naïve, but absurd. If there are no right answers,\nthere are no wrong answers either.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that requiring courts to\nshow “respect for the democratic process” should serve as\na constraint. Post, at 23. That is true, but JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would have them show respect in an extraordi­\nnary manner. In his view, if a right “is already being\ngiven careful consideration in, and subjected to ongoing\ncalibration by, the States, judicial enforcement may not be\nappropriate.” Ibid. In other words, a right, such as the\nright to keep and bear arms, that has long been recognized\nbut on which the States are considering restrictions, ap­\nparently deserves less protection, while a privilege the\npolitical branches (instruments of the democratic process)\nhave withheld entirely and continue to withhold, deserves\nmore. That topsy-turvy approach conveniently accom­\nplishes the objective of ensuring that the rights this Court\nheld protected in Casey, Lawrence, and other such cases fit\nthe theory—but at the cost of insulting rather than re­\nspecting the democratic process.\n  The next constraint JUSTICE STEVENS suggests is harder\n\f6                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nto evaluate. He describes as “an important tool for guiding\njudicial discretion” “sensitivity to the interaction between\nthe intrinsic aspects of liberty and the practical realities of\ncontemporary society.” Post, at 24. I cannot say whether\nthat sensitivity will really guide judges because I have no\nidea what it is. Is it some sixth sense instilled in judges\nwhen they ascend to the bench? Or does it mean judges\nare more constrained when they agonize about the cosmic\nconflict between liberty and its potentially harmful conse­\nquences? Attempting to give the concept more precision,\nJUSTICE STEVENS explains that “sensitivity is an aspect of\na deeper principle: the need to approach our work with\nhumility and caution.” Ibid. Both traits are undeniably\nadmirable, though what relation they bear to sensitivity is\na mystery. But it makes no difference, for the first case\nJUSTICE STEVENS cites in support, see ibid., Casey, 505\nU. S., at 849, dispels any illusion that he has a meaningful\nform of judicial modesty in mind.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS offers no examples to illustrate the\nnext constraint: stare decisis, post, at 25. But his view of it\nis surely not very confining, since he holds out as a “ca­\nnonical” exemplar of the proper approach, see post, at 16,\n54, Lawrence, which overruled a case decided a mere 17\nyears earlier, Bowers v. Hardwick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111738\"><a href=\"/opinion/111738/bowers-v-hardwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986),\nsee 539 U. S., at 578 (it “was not correct when it was\ndecided, and it is not correct today”). Moreover, JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would apply that constraint unevenly: He appar­\nently approves those Warren Court cases that adopted jot­\nfor-jot incorporation of procedural protections for criminal\ndefendants, post, at 11, but would abandon those Warren\nCourt rulings that undercut his approach to substantive\nrights, on the basis that we have “cut back” on cases from\nthat era before, post, at 12.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS also relies on the requirement of a\n“careful description of the asserted fundamental liberty\ninterest” to limit judicial discretion.

But if\nthe “careful description” requirement is used in the man­\nner we have hitherto employed, then the enterprise of\ndetermining the Due Process Clause’s “conceptual core,”\npost, at 23, is a waste of time. In the cases he cites we\nsought a careful, specific description of the right at issue\nin order to determine whether that right, thus narrowly\ndefined, was fundamental.

The threshold step of defining the asserted right\nwith precision is entirely unnecessary, however, if (as\nJUSTICE STEVENS maintains) the “conceptual core” of the\n“liberty clause,” post, at 23, includes a number of capa­\ncious, hazily defined categories. There is no need to define\nthe right with much precision in order to conclude that it\npertains to the plaintiff’s “ability independently to define\n[his] identity,” his “right to make certain unusually impor­\ntant decisions that will affect his own, or his family’s,\ndestiny,” or some aspect of his “[s]elf-determination, bodily\nintegrity, freedom of conscience, intimate relationships,\npolitical equality, dignity [or] respect.” Ibid. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). JUSTICE STEVENS must there­\nfore have in mind some other use for the careful­\ndescription requirement—perhaps just as a means of\nensuring that courts “procee[d] slowly and incrementally,”\npost, at 25. But that could be achieved just as well by\n\f8                      MCDONALD v.

He offers several reasons for concluding that the\nSecond Amendment right to keep and bear arms is not\nfundamental enough to be applied against the States.5\nNone is persuasive, but more pertinent to my purpose,\neach is either intrinsically indeterminate, would preclude\nincorporation of rights we have already held incorporated,\nor both. His approach therefore does nothing to stop a\njudge from arriving at any conclusion he sets out to reach.\n  JUSTICE STEVENS begins with the odd assertion that\n\n——————\n    4 After\n          defending the careful-description criterion, JUSTICE STEVENS\nquickly retreats and cautions courts not to apply it too stringently.\nPost, at 26. Describing a right too specifically risks robbing it of its\n“universal valence and a moral force it might otherwise have,” ibid.,\nand “loads the dice against its recognition,” post, at 26, n. 25 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). That must be avoided, since it endangers\nrights JUSTICE STEVENS does like. See ibid. (discussing Lawrence v.\nTexas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003)). To make sure those rights get in, we must\nleave leeway in our description, so that a right that has not itself been\nrecognized as fundamental can ride the coattails of one that has been.\n  5 JUSTICE STEVENS claims that I mischaracterize his argument by\n\nreferring to the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms,\ninstead of “the interest in keeping a firearm of one’s choosing in the\nhome,” the right he says petitioners assert. Post, at 38, n. 36. But it is\nprecisely the “Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms” that\npetitioners argue is incorporated by the Due Process Clause. See, e.g.,\nPet. for Cert. i. Under JUSTICE STEVENS’ own approach, that should end\nthe matter. See post, at 26 (“[W]e must pay close attention to the\nprecise liberty interest the litigants have asked us to vindicate”). In\nany event, the demise of watered-down incorporation, see ante, at 17–\n19, means that we no longer subdivide Bill of Rights guarantees into\ntheir theoretical components, only some of which apply to the States.\nThe First Amendment freedom of speech is incorporated—not the\nfreedom to speak on Fridays, or to speak about philosophy.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Post, at\n35. The source of the rule that only nonambivalent liber­\nties deserve Due Process protection is never explained—\nproof that judges applying JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach can\nadd new elements to the test as they see fit. The criterion,\nmoreover, is inherently manipulable. Surely JUSTICE\nSTEVENS does not mean that the Clause covers only rights\nthat have zero harmful effect on anyone. Otherwise even\nthe First Amendment is out. Maybe what he means is\nthat the right to keep and bear arms imposes too great a\nrisk to others’ physical well-being. But as the plurality\nexplains, ante, at 35–36, other rights we have already held\nincorporated pose similarly substantial risks to public\nsafety. In all events, JUSTICE STEVENS supplies neither a\nstandard for how severe the impairment on others’ liberty\nmust be for a right to be disqualified, nor (of course) any\nmethod of measuring the severity.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next suggests that the Second\nAmendment right is not fundamental because it is “differ­\nent in kind” from other rights we have recognized. Post, at\n37. In one respect, of course, the right to keep and bear\narms is different from some other rights we have held the\nClause protects and he would recognize: It is deeply\ngrounded in our nation’s history and tradition. But\nJUSTICE STEVENS has a different distinction in mind:\nEven though he does “not doubt for a moment that many\nAmericans . . . see [firearms] as critical to their way of life\nas well as to their security,” he pronounces that owning a\nhandgun is not “critical to leading a life of autonomy,\ndignity, or political equality.”6 Post, at 37–38. Who says?\n——————\n   6 JUSTICE STEVENS goes a step farther still, suggesting that the right\n\nto keep and bear arms is not protected by the “liberty clause” because it\nis not really a liberty at all, but a “property right.” Post, at 38.

When\nit comes to guns, JUSTICE STEVENS explains, our Nation is\nalready an outlier among “advanced democracies”; not\neven our “oldest allies” protect as robust a right as we do,\nand we should not widen the gap. Ibid. Never mind that\nhe explains neither which countries qualify as “advanced\ndemocracies” nor why others are irrelevant. For there is\nan even clearer indication that this criterion lets judges\npick which rights States must respect and those they can\nignore: As the plurality shows, ante, at 34–35, and nn. 28–\n29, this follow-the-foreign-crowd requirement would fore­\n——————\nmind that the right to bear arms sounds mighty like a liberty; and\nnever mind that the “liberty clause” is really a Due Process Clause\nwhich explicitly protects “property,” see United States v.

But that inquiry provides infinitely less\nscope for judicial invention when conducted under the Court’s ap­\nproach, since the field of candidates is immensely narrowed by the prior\nrequirement that a right be rooted in this country’s traditions. JUSTICE\nSTEVENS, on the other hand, is free to scan the universe for rights that\nhe thinks “implicit in the concept, etc.” The point JUSTICE STEVENS\nmakes here is merely one example of his demand that an historical\napproach to the Constitution prove itself, not merely much better than\nhis in restraining judicial invention, but utterly perfect in doing so.

A judge applying JUSTICE\nSTEVENS’ approach must either throw all of those rights\noverboard or, as cases JUSTICE STEVENS approves have\ndone in considering unenumerated rights, simply ignore\nforeign law when it undermines the desired conclusion,\nsee, e.g., Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (making no mention of\nforeign law).\n   JUSTICE STEVENS also argues that since the right to\nkeep and bear arms was codified for the purpose of “pre­\nvent[ing] elimination of the militia,” it should be viewed as\n“ ‘a federalism provision’ ” logically incapable of incorpora­\ntion. Post, at 41–42 (quoting Elk Grove Unified School\nDist. v. Newdow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136984\"><a href=\"/opinion/136984/elk-grove-unified-school-dist-v-newdow/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (2004) (THOMAS, J., con­\ncurring in judgment); some internal quotation marks\nomitted). This criterion, too, evidently applies only when\njudges want it to. The opinion JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nfor the “federalism provision” principle, JUSTICE THOMAS’s\nconcurrence in Newdow, argued that incorporation of the\nEstablishment Clause “makes little sense” because that\nClause was originally understood as a limit on congres­\nsional interference with state establishments of religion.\nId., at 49–51. JUSTICE STEVENS, of course, has no problem\nwith applying the Establishment Clause to the States.\nSee, e.g., id., at 8, n. 4 (opinion for the Court by STEVENS,\nJ.) (acknowledging that the Establishment Clause\n“appl[ies] to the States by incorporation into the Four­\nteenth Amendment”). While he insists that Clause is not a\n“federalism provision,” post, at 42, n. 40, he does not ex­\nplain why it is not, but the right to keep and bear arms is\n(even though only the latter refers to a “right of the peo­\nple”). The “federalism” argument prevents the incorpora­\ntion of only certain rights.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS next argues that even if the right to\n\f12                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nkeep and bear arms is “deeply rooted in some important\nsenses,” the roots of States’ efforts to regulate guns run\njust as deep. Post, at 44 (internal quotation marks omit­\nted). But this too is true of other rights we have held\nincorporated. No fundamental right—not even the First\nAmendment—is absolute. The traditional restrictions go\nto show the scope of the right, not its lack of fundamental\ncharacter. At least that is what they show (JUSTICE\nSTEVENS would agree) for other rights. Once again, prin­\nciples are applied selectively.\n   JUSTICE STEVENS’ final reason for rejecting incorpora­\ntion of the Second Amendment reveals, more clearly than\nany of the others, the game that is afoot. Assuming that\nthere is a “plausible constitutional basis” for holding that\nthe right to keep and bear arms is incorporated, he asserts\nthat we ought not to do so for prudential reasons. Post, at\n47. Even if we had the authority to withhold rights that\nare within the Constitution’s command (and we assuredly\ndo not), two of the reasons JUSTICE STEVENS gives for\nabstention show just how much power he would hand to\njudges. The States’ “right to experiment” with solutions to\nthe problem of gun violence, he says, is at its apex here\nbecause “the best solution is far from clear.” Post, at 47–\n48 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The obviousness of the optimal answer is in the\neye of the beholder. The implication of JUSTICE STEVENS’\ncall for abstention is that if We The Court conclude that\nThey The People’s answers to a problem are silly, we are\nfree to “interven[e],” post, at 47, but if we too are uncertain\nof the right answer, or merely think the States may be on\nto something, we can loosen the leash.\n   A second reason JUSTICE STEVENS says we should ab­\nstain is that the States have shown they are “capable” of\nprotecting the right at issue, and if anything have pro­\ntected it too much. Post, at 49. That reflects an assump­\ntion that judges can distinguish between a proper democ­\nratic decision to leave things alone (which we should\nhonor), and a case of democratic market failure (which we\nshould step in to correct). I would not—and no judge\nshould—presume to have that sort of omniscience, which\nseems to me far more “arrogant,” post, at 41, than confin­\ning courts’ focus to our own national heritage.\n                              III\n   JUSTICE STEVENS’ response to this concurrence, post, at\n51–56, makes the usual rejoinder of “living Constitution”\nadvocates to the criticism that it empowers judges to\neliminate or expand what the people have prescribed: The\ntraditional, historically focused method, he says, reposes\ndiscretion in judges as well.8 Historical analysis can be\n——————\n  8 JUSTICE STEVENS also asserts that his approach is “more faithful to\nthis Nation’s constitutional history” and to “the values and commit­\nments of the American people, as they stand today,” post, at 54. But\nwhat he asserts to be the proof of this is that his approach aligns (no\nsurprise) with those cases he approves (and dubs “canonical,” ibid.).\nCases he disfavors are discarded as “hardly bind[ing]” “excesses,” post,\nat 12, or less “enduring,” post, at 17, n. 16. Not proven. Moreover,\nwhatever relevance JUSTICE STEVENS ascribes to current “values and\n\f14                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          SCALIA, J., concurring\n\ndifficult; it sometimes requires resolving threshold ques­\ntions, and making nuanced judgments about which evi­\ndence to consult and how to interpret it.\n   I will stipulate to that.9 But the question to be decided\nis not whether the historically focused method is a perfect\nmeans of restraining aristocratic judicial Constitution­\nwriting; but whether it is the best means available in an\nimperfect world. Or indeed, even more narrowly than\nthat: whether it is demonstrably much better than what\nJUSTICE STEVENS proposes. I think it beyond all serious\ndispute that it is much less subjective, and intrudes much\nless upon the democratic process. It is less subjective\nbecause it depends upon a body of evidence susceptible of\nreasoned analysis rather than a variety of vague ethico­\npolitical First Principles whose combined conclusion can\nbe found to point in any direction the judges favor. In the\nmost controversial matters brought before this Court—for\nexample, the constitutionality of prohibiting abortion,\nassisted suicide, or homosexual sodomy, or the constitu­\ntionality of the death penalty—any historical methodology,\nunder any plausible standard of proof, would lead to the\nsame conclusion.10 Moreover, the methodological differ­\nences that divide historians, and the varying interpretive\n——————\ncommitments of the American people” (and that is unclear, see post, at\n48–49, n. 47), it is hard to see how it shows fidelity to them that he\ndisapproves a different subset of old cases than the Court does.\n   9 That is not to say that every historical question on which there is\n\nroom for debate is indeterminate, or that every question on which\nhistorians disagree is equally balanced. Cf. post, at 52–53. For exam­\nple, the historical analysis of the principal dissent in Heller is as valid\nas the Court’s only in a two-dimensional world that conflates length\nand depth.\n   10 By the way, JUSTICE STEVENS greatly magnifies the difficulty of an\n\nhistorical approach by suggesting that it was my burden in Lawrence to\nshow the “ancient roots of proscriptions against sodomy,” post, at 53\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Au contraire, it was his burden (in\nthe opinion he joined) to show the ancient roots of the right of sodomy.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           15\n\n                     SCALIA, J., concurring\n\nassumptions they bring to their work, post, at 52–54, are\nnothing compared to the differences among the American\npeople (though perhaps not among graduates of prestig­\nious law schools) with regard to the moral judgments\nJUSTICE STEVENS would have courts pronounce. And\nwhether or not special expertise is needed to answer his­\ntorical questions, judges most certainly have no “compara­\ntive . . . advantage,” post, at 24 (internal quotation marks\nomitted), in resolving moral disputes. What is more, his\napproach would not eliminate, but multiply, the hard\nquestions courts must confront, since he would not replace\nhistory with moral philosophy, but would have courts\nconsider both.\n   And the Court’s approach intrudes less upon the democ­\nratic process because the rights it acknowledges are those\nestablished by a constitutional history formed by democ­\nratic decisions; and the rights it fails to acknowledge are\nleft to be democratically adopted or rejected by the people,\nwith the assurance that their decision is not subject to\njudicial revision. JUSTICE STEVENS’ approach, on the\nother hand, deprives the people of that power, since what­\never the Constitution and laws may say, the list of pro­\ntected rights will be whatever courts wish it to be. After\nall, he notes, the people have been wrong before, post, at\n55, and courts may conclude they are wrong in the future.\nJUSTICE STEVENS abhors a system in which “majorities or\npowerful interest groups always get their way,” post, at 56,\nbut replaces it with a system in which unelected and life­\ntenured judges always get their way. That such usurpa­\ntion is effected unabashedly, see post, at 53—with “the\njudge’s cards . . . laid on the table,” ibid.—makes it even\nworse. In a vibrant democracy, usurpation should have to\nbe accomplished in the dark. It is JUSTICE STEVENS’ ap­\nproach, not the Court’s, that puts democracy in peril.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

The question in this case\nis whether the Constitution protects that right against\nabridgment by the States.\n   As the Court explains, if this case were litigated before\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption in 1868, the an\nswer to that question would be simple.

The provision at issue here, §1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment, significantly altered our system\nof government. The first sentence of that section provides\nthat “[a]ll persons born or naturalized in the United States\nand subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the\nUnited States and of the State wherein they reside.” This\nunambiguously overruled this Court’s contrary holding in\nDred Scott v.

Id., at 405–406.\n   The meaning of §1’s next sentence has divided this\nCourt for many years. That sentence begins with the\ncommand that “[n]o State shall make or enforce any law\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citi\nzens of the United States.” On its face, this appears to\ngrant the persons just made United States citizens a\ncertain collection of rights—i.e., privileges or immunities—\nattributable to that status.\n   This Court’s precedents accept that point, but define the\nrelevant collection of rights quite narrowly.         In the\nSlaughter-House Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1873), decided just\nfive years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s adoption, the\n\f4                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt interpreted this text, now known as the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause, for the first time. In a closely\ndivided decision, the Court drew a sharp distinction be\ntween the privileges and immunities of state citizenship\nand those of federal citizenship, and held that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause protected only the latter cate\ngory of rights from state abridgment. Id., at 78. The\nCourt defined that category to include only those rights\n“which owe their existence to the Federal government, its\nNational character, its Constitution, or its laws.” Id., at\n79. This arguably left open the possibility that certain\nindividual rights enumerated in the Constitution could be\nconsidered privileges or immunities of federal citizenship.\nSee ibid. (listing “[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and\n“the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus” as rights poten\ntially protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause).\nBut the Court soon rejected that proposition, interpreting\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause even more narrowly\nin its later cases.\n   Chief among those cases is United States v. Cruikshank,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"89309\"><a href=\"/opinion/89309/united-states-v-cruikshank/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1876). There, the Court held that members\nof a white militia who had brutally murdered as many as\n165 black Louisianians congregating outside a courthouse\nhad not deprived the victims of their privileges as Ameri\ncan citizens to peaceably assemble or to keep and bear\narms. Ibid.; see L. Keith, The Colfax Massacre 109 (2008).\nAccording to the Court, the right to peaceably assemble\ncodified in the First Amendment was not a privilege of\nUnited States citizenship because “[t]he right . . . existed\nlong before the adoption of the Constitution.” 92 U. S., at\n551 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Court held that the\nright to keep and bear arms was not a privilege of United\nStates citizenship because it was not “in any manner\ndependent upon that instrument for its existence.” Id., at\n553. In other words, the reason the Framers codified the\nright to bear arms in the Second Amendment—its nature\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Roe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118286\"><a href=\"/opinion/118286/saenz-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503\n(1999), that are not readily described as essential to\nliberty.\n   As a consequence of this Court’s marginalization of the\nClause, litigants seeking federal protection of fundamental\nrights turned to the remainder of §1 in search of an alter\nnative fount of such rights. They found one in a most\ncurious place—that section’s command that every State\nguarantee “due process” to any person before depriving\nhim of “life, liberty, or property.” At first, litigants argued\nthat this Due Process Clause “incorporated” certain proce\ndural rights codified in the Bill of Rights against the\nStates. The Court generally rejected those claims, how\never, on the theory that the rights in question were not\nsufficiently “fundamental” to warrant such treatment.\nSee, e.g., Hurtado v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91054\"><a href=\"/opinion/91054/hurtado-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1884)\n(grand jury indictment requirement); Maxwell v.

The notion that a constitu\ntional provision that guarantees only “process” before a\nperson is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define\nthe substance of those rights strains credulity for even the\nmost casual user of words. Moreover, this fiction is a\nparticularly dangerous one. The one theme that links the\nCourt’s substantive due process precedents together is\ntheir lack of a guiding principle to distinguish “fundamen\ntal” rights that warrant protection from nonfundamental\nrights that do not. Today’s decision illustrates the point.\nReplaying a debate that has endured from the inception of\nthe Court’s substantive due process jurisprudence, the\ndissents laud the “flexibility” in this Court’s substantive\ndue process doctrine, post, at 14 (STEVENS, J., dissenting);\nsee post, at 6–8 (BREYER, J., dissenting), while the plural\nity makes yet another effort to impose principled re\nstraints on its exercise, see ante, at 33–41. But neither\nside argues that the meaning they attribute to the Due\nProcess Clause was consistent with public understanding\nat the time of its ratification.\n   To be sure, the plurality’s effort to cabin the exercise of\njudicial discretion under the Due Process Clause by focus\ning its inquiry on those rights deeply rooted in American\nhistory and tradition invites less opportunity for abuse\nthan the alternatives. See post, at 7 (BREYER, J., dissent\ning) (arguing that rights should be incorporated against\nthe States through the Due Process Clause if they are\n“well-suited to the carrying out of . . . constitutional prom\n\f8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nises”); post, at 22 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (warning that\nthere is no “all-purpose, top-down, totalizing theory of\n‘liberty’ ” protected by the Due Process Clause). But any\nserious argument over the scope of the Due Process Clause\nmust acknowledge that neither its text nor its history\nsuggests that it protects the many substantive rights this\nCourt’s cases now claim it does.\n   I cannot accept a theory of constitutional interpretation\nthat rests on such tenuous footing. This Court’s substan\ntive due process framework fails to account for both the\ntext of the Fourteenth Amendment and the history that\nled to its adoption, filling that gap with a jurisprudence\ndevoid of a guiding principle. I believe the original mean\ning of the Fourteenth Amendment offers a superior alter\nnative, and that a return to that meaning would allow this\nCourt to enforce the rights the Fourteenth Amendment is\ndesigned to protect with greater clarity and predictability\nthan the substantive due process framework has so far\nmanaged.\n   I acknowledge the volume of precedents that have been\nbuilt upon the substantive due process framework, and I\nfurther acknowledge the importance of stare decisis to the\nstability of our Nation’s legal system.

See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *129\n(describing the “rights and liberties” of Englishmen as\n“private immunities” and “civil privileges”). A number of\nantebellum judicial decisions used the terms in this man\nner. See, e.g., Magill v.

In addition,\ndictionary definitions confirm that the public shared this\nunderstanding. See, e.g., N. Webster, An American Dic\ntionary of the English Language 1039 (C.

See 1\nB. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History\n8−16, 19−21, 41−46 (1971) (hereinafter Schwartz).

They consistently claimed the rights of\nEnglish citizenship in their founding documents, repeat\nedly referring to these rights as “privileges” and “immuni\nties.” For example, a Maryland law provided that\n     “[A]ll the Inhabitants of this Province being Chris\n     tians (Slaves excepted) Shall have and enjoy all such\n     rights liberties immunities priviledges and free cus\n     toms within this Province as any naturall born subject\n     of England hath or ought to have or enjoy in the\n     Realm of England . . . .” Md.

In his view, Article\nIV, §2 did not guarantee equal access to all public benefits\na State might choose to make available to its citizens. See\nid., at 552. Instead, it applied only to those rights “which\nare, in their nature, fundamental; which belong, of right,\nto the citizens of all free governments.” Id., at 551 (em\nphasis added).

First, “privileges” and “immunities” were synonyms\nfor “rights.” Second, both the States and the Federal\nGovernment had long recognized the inalienable rights of\ntheir citizens. Third, Article IV, §2 of the Constitution\nprotected traveling citizens against state discrimination\nwith respect to the fundamental rights of state citizenship.\n  Two questions still remain, both provoked by the textual\nsimilarity between §1’s Privileges or Immunities Clause\nand Article IV, §2. The first involves the nature of the\nrights at stake: Are the privileges or immunities of “citi\nzens of the United States” recognized by §1 the same as\nthe privileges and immunities of “citizens in the several\nStates” to which Article IV, §2 refers? The second involves\nthe restriction imposed on the States: Does §1, like Article\nIV, §2, prohibit only discrimination with respect to certain\nrights if the State chooses to recognize them, or does it\nrequire States to recognize those rights? I address each\nquestion in turn.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

Section 1 overruled Dred\nScott’s holding that blacks were not citizens of either the\nUnited States or their own State and, thus, did not enjoy\n“the privileges and immunities of citizens” embodied in the\nConstitution. 19 How., at 417. The Court in Dred Scott\ndid not distinguish between privileges and immunities of\ncitizens of the United States and citizens in the several\nStates, instead referring to the rights of citizens generally.\nIt did, however, give examples of what the rights of citi\nzens were—the constitutionally enumerated rights of “the\nfull liberty of speech” and the right “to keep and carry\narms.” Ibid.\n   Section 1 protects the rights of citizens “of the United\nStates” specifically. The evidence overwhelmingly demon\nstrates that the privileges and immunities of such citizens\nincluded individual rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nincluding the right to keep and bear arms.\n                              1\n  Nineteenth-century treaties through which the United\nStates acquired territory from other sovereigns routinely\npromised inhabitants of the newly acquired territories\nthat they would enjoy all of the “rights,” “privileges,” and\n“immunities” of United States citizens. See, e.g., Treaty of\nAmity, Settlement, and Limits, Art. 6, Feb. 22, 1819, 8\nStat. 256−258, T. S. No. 327 (entered into force Feb. 19,\n1821) (cession of Florida) (“The inhabitants of the territo\nries which his Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States,\nby this Treaty, shall be incorporated in the Union of the\nUnited States, as soon as may be consistent with the\nprinciples of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to the\nenjoyment of all the privileges, rights, and immunities, of\n\f20                      MCDONALD v.

It\nis therefore altogether unsurprising that several of these\ntreaties identify liberties enumerated in the Constitution\nas privileges and immunities common to all United States\ncitizens.\n   For example, the Louisiana Cession Act of 1803, which\ncodified a treaty between the United States and France\nculminating in the Louisiana Purchase, provided that\n     “The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incor\n     porated in the Union of the United States, and admit\n     ted as soon as possible, according to the principles of\n     the Federal constitution, to the enjoyments of all the\n     rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the\n     United States; and in the mean time they shall be\n     maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of\n     their liberty, property and the religion which they pro\n     fess.” Treaty Between the United States of America\n——————\n  7 See  also Treaty Between the United States of America and the Ot\ntawa Indians of Blanchard’s Fork and Roche De Boeuf, June 24, 1862,\n12 Stat. 1237 (“The Ottawa Indians of the United Bands of Blanchard’s\nFork and of Roche de Boeuf, having become sufficiently advanced in\ncivilization, and being desirous of becoming citizens of the United\nStates . . .

No. 86 (emphasis added).8\n  The Louisiana Cession Act reveals even more about the\nprivileges and immunities of United States citizenship\nbecause it provoked an extensive public debate on the\nmeaning of that term. In 1820, when the Missouri Terri\ntory (which the United States acquired through the Ces\nsion Act) sought to enter the Union as a new State, a\ndebate ensued over whether to prohibit slavery within\nMissouri as a condition of its admission. Some congress\nmen argued that prohibiting slavery in Missouri would\ndeprive its inhabitants of the “privileges and immunities”\nthey had been promised by the Cession Act. See, e.g., 35\nAnnals of Cong. 1083 (1855) (remarks of Kentucky Rep.\nHardin). But those who opposed slavery in Missouri\nargued that the right to hold slaves was merely a matter\nof state property law, not one of the privileges and immu\nnities of United States citizenship guaranteed by the Act.9\n——————\n   8 Subsequent treaties contained similar guarantees that the inhabi\n\ntants of the newly acquired territories would enjoy the freedom to\nexercise certain constitutional rights. See Treaty of Peace, Friendship,\nLimits, and Settlement with the Republic of Mexico, Art. IX, Feb. 2,\n1848, 9 Stat. 930, T. S.

CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   Daniel Webster was among the leading proponents of\nthe antislavery position. In his “Memorial to Congress,”\nWebster argued that “[t]he rights, advantages and immu\nnities here spoken of [in the Cession Act] must . . . be such\nas are recognized or communicated by the Constitution of\nthe United States,” not the “rights, advantages and im\nmunities, derived exclusively from the State governments\n. . . .” D. Webster, A Memorial to the Congress of the\nUnited States on the Subject of Restraining the Increase of\nSlavery in New States to be Admitted into the Union 15\n(Dec. 15, 1819) (emphasis added). “The obvious meaning”\nof the Act, in Webster’s view, was that “the rights derived\nunder the federal Constitution shall be enjoyed by the\ninhabitants of [the territory].” Id., at 15–16 (emphasis\nadded). In other words, Webster articulated a distinction\nbetween the rights of United States citizenship and the\nrights of state citizenship, and argued that the former\nincluded those rights “recognized or communicated by the\nConstitution.” Since the right to hold slaves was not\nmentioned in the Constitution, it was not a right of federal\ncitizenship.\n   Webster and his allies ultimately lost the debate over\nslavery in Missouri and the territory was admitted as a\nslave State as part of the now-famous Missouri Compro\nmise. Missouri Enabling Act of March 6, 1820, ch. 22, §8,\n3 Stat. 548. But their arguments continued to inform\npublic understanding of the privileges and immunities of\n——————\ntion in the House of the Representatives 16 (1820), as published in\npamphlet form and reprinted in 22 Moore Pamphlets, p. 16 (“If the\nright to hold slaves is a federal right and attached merely to citizenship\nof the United States, [then slavery] could maintain itself against state\nauthority, and on this principle the owner might take his slaves into\nany state he pleased, in defiance of the state laws, but this would be\ncontrary to the constitution”); see also Lash, The Origins of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, Part I: “Privileges and Immunities” as an\nAntebellum Term of Art, 98 Geo.

In 1854, Webster’s Memorial\nwas republished in a pamphlet discussing the Nation’s\nnext major debate on slavery—the proposed repeal of the\nMissouri Compromise through the Kansas-Nebraska Act,\nsee The Nebraska Question: Comprising Speeches in the\nUnited States Senate: Together with the History of the\nMissouri Compromise 9–12 (1854).

In 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued a\nproclamation granting amnesty to former Confederates,\nguaranteeing “to all and to every person who directly or\nindirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion,\na full pardon and amnesty for the offence of treason . . .\nwith restoration of all rights, privileges, and immunities\nunder the Constitution and the laws which have been\nmade in pursuance thereof.” 15 Stat. 712.\n  Records from the 39th Congress further support this\nunderstanding.\n                            a\n  After the Civil War, Congress established the Joint\nCommittee on Reconstruction to investigate circumstances\nin the Southern States and to determine whether, and on\nwhat conditions, those States should be readmitted to the\n\f24                 MCDONALD v.

Curtis, No State\nShall Abridge: The Fourteenth Amendment and the Bill of\nRights 57 (1986) (hereinafter Curtis). That Committee\nwould ultimately recommend the adoption of the Four\nteenth Amendment, justifying its recommendation by\nsubmitting a report to Congress that extensively cata\nlogued the abuses of civil rights in the former slave States\nand argued that “adequate security for future peace and\nsafety . . . can only be found in such changes of the organic\nlaw as shall determine the civil rights and privileges of all\ncitizens in all parts of the republic.” See Report of the\nJoint Committee on Reconstruction, S. Rep. No. 112, 39th\nCong., 1st Sess., p. 15 (1866); H. R. Rep. No. 30, 39th\nCong., 1st Sess., p.

In\naddition, newspaper coverage suggests that the wider\npublic was aware of the Committee’s work even before the\nReport was issued. For example, the Fort Wayne Daily\nDemocrat (which appears to have been unsupportive of the\nCommittee’s work) paraphrased a motion instructing the\nCommittee to\n     “enquire into [the] expediency of amending the Con\n     stitution of the United States so as to declare with\n     greater certainty the power of Congress to enforce and\n     determine by appropriate legislation all the guaran\n     tees contained in that instrument.” The Nigger Con\n     gress!, Fort Wayne Daily Democrat, Feb. 1, 1866, p. 4\n     (emphasis added).\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Before considering that record here, it is\nimportant to clarify its relevance. When interpreting\nconstitutional text, the goal is to discern the most likely\npublic understanding of a particular provision at the time\nit was adopted. Statements by legislators can assist in\nthis process to the extent they demonstrate the manner in\nwhich the public used or understood a particular word or\nphrase. They can further assist to the extent there is\nevidence that these statements were disseminated to the\npublic. In other words, this evidence is useful not because\nit demonstrates what the draftsmen of the text may have\nbeen thinking, but only insofar as it illuminates what the\npublic understood the words chosen by the draftsmen to\nmean.\n                             (1)\n  Three speeches stand out as particularly significant.\nRepresentative John Bingham, the principal draftsman of\n§1, delivered a speech on the floor of the House in Febru\nary 1866 introducing his first draft of the provision. Bing\nham began by discussing Barron and its holding that the\nBill of Rights did not apply to the States. He then argued\nthat a constitutional amendment was necessary to provide\n“an express grant of power in Congress to enforce by penal\nenactment these great canons of the supreme law, secur\n\f26                    MCDONALD v.

Globe 1089–1090 (1866).\nBingham emphasized that §1 was designed “to arm the\nCongress of the United States, by the consent of the people\nof the United States, with the power to enforce the bill of\nrights as it stands in the Constitution today. It ‘hath that\nextent—no more.’ ” Id., at 1088.\n    Bingham’s speech was printed in pamphlet form and\nbroadly distributed in 1866 under the title, “One Country,\nOne Constitution, and One People,” and the subtitle, “In\nSupport of the Proposed Amendment to Enforce the Bill of\nRights.”10 Newspapers also reported his proposal, with\nthe New York Times providing particularly extensive\ncoverage, including a full reproduction of Bingham’s first\ndraft of §1 and his remarks that a constitutional amend\nment to “enforc[e]” the “immortal bill of rights” was “abso\nlutely essential to American nationality.” N. Y. Times,\nFeb. 27, 1866, p. 8.\n    Bingham’s first draft of §1 was different from the ver\nsion ultimately adopted. Of particular importance, the\nfirst draft granted Congress the “power to make all laws\n. . . necessary and proper to secure” the “citizens of each\nState all privileges and immunities of citizens in the sev\neral States,” rather than restricting state power to\n“abridge” the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\nUnited States.11 39th Cong.

A front-page article hailed the “Clear\nand Forcible Speech” by Representative Robert Hale\nagainst the draft, explaining—and endorsing—Hale’s view\nthat Bingham’s proposal would “confer upon Congress all\nthe rights and power of legislation now reserved to the\nStates” and would “in effect utterly obliterate State rights\nand State authority over their own internal affairs.”12\nN. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1.\n   Critically, Hale did not object to the draft insofar as it\npurported to protect constitutional liberties against state\ninterference. Indeed, Hale stated that he believed (incor\nrectly in light of Barron) that individual rights enumer\nated in the Constitution were already enforceable against\nthe States. See 39th Cong. Globe 1064 (“I have, somehow\nor other, gone along with the impression that there is that\nsort of protection thrown over us in some way, whether\nwith or without the sanction of a judicial decision that we\nare so protected”); see N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, at 1.\nHale’s misperception was not uncommon among members\nof the Reconstruction generation. See infra, at 38–40. But\nthat is secondary to the point that the Times’ coverage of\n\n——————\n“The Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be neces\nsary and proper to secure to the citizens of each State all privileges and\nimmunities of citizens in the several States, and to all persons in the\nseveral States equal protection in the rights of life, liberty, and prop\nerty.” 39th Cong. Globe 1088.\n   12 In a separate front-page article on the same day, the paper ex\n\npounded upon Hale’s arguments in even further detail, while omitting\nBingham’s chief rebuttals. N. Y. Times, Feb. 28, 1866, p. 1. The\nunbalanced nature of The New York Times’ coverage is unsurprising.\nAs scholars have noted, “[m]ost papers” during the time of Reconstruc\ntion “had a frank partisan slant . . . and the Times was no exception.”\nWildenthal 1559. In 1866, the paper “was still defending” President\nJohnson’s resistance to Republican reform measures, as exemplified by\nthe fact that it “supported Johnson’s veto of the Civil Rights Act of\n1866.” Ibid.\n\f28                MCDONALD v.

In the\ninterim, he delivered a second well-publicized speech,\nagain arguing that a constitutional amendment was re\nquired to give Congress the power to enforce the Bill of\nRights against the States. That speech was printed in\npamphlet form, see Speech of Hon. John A. Bingham, of\nOhio, on the Civil Rights Bill, Mar. 9, 1866 (Cong. Globe);\nsee 39th Cong. Globe 1837 (remarks of Rep.

Senator Jacob Howard introduced the\nnew draft on the floor of the Senate in the third speech\nrelevant here. Howard explained that the Constitution\nrecognized “a mass of privileges, immunities, and rights,\nsome of them secured by the second section of the fourth\narticle of the Constitution, . . . some by the first eight\namendments of the Constitution,” and that “there is no\npower given in the Constitution to enforce and to carry out\nany of these guarantees” against the States. 39th Cong.\nGlobe 2765.

CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  As a whole, these well-circulated speeches indicate that\n§1 was understood to enforce constitutionally declared\nrights against the States, and they provide no suggestion\nthat any language in the section other than the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause would accomplish that task.\n                              (2)\n   When read against this backdrop, the civil rights legis\nlation adopted by the 39th Congress in 1866 further sup\nports this view. Between passing the Thirteenth Amend\nment—which outlawed slavery alone—and the Fourteenth\nAmendment, Congress passed two significant pieces of\nlegislation. The first was the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\nwhich provided that “all persons born in the United\nStates” were “citizens of the United States” and that “such\ncitizens, of every race and color, . . . shall have the same\nright” to, among other things, “full and equal benefit of all\nlaws and proceedings for the security of person and prop\nerty, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Ch. 31, §1, 14 Stat.\n27.\n   Both proponents and opponents of this Act described it\nas providing the “privileges” of citizenship to freedmen,\nand defined those privileges to include constitutional\nrights, such as the right to keep and bear arms. See 39th\nCong. Globe 474 (remarks of Sen. Trumbull) (stating that\nthe “the late slaveholding States” had enacted laws “de\npriving persons of African descent of privileges which are\nessential to freemen,” including “prohibit[ing] any negro or\nmulatto from having fire-arms” and stating that “[t]he\npurpose of the bill under consideration is to destroy all\nthese discriminations”); id., at 1266–1267 (remarks of Rep.\nRaymond) (opposing the Act, but recognizing that to\n“[m]ake a colored man a citizen of the United States”\nwould guarantee to him, inter alia, “a defined status . . . a\nright to defend himself and his wife and children; a right\nto bear arms”).\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           31\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n  Three months later, Congress passed the Freedmen’s\nBureau Act, which also entitled all citizens to the “full and\nequal benefit of all laws and proceedings concerning per\nsonal liberty” and “personal security.” Act of July 16,\n1866, ch. 200, §14, 14 Stat. 176. The Act stated expressly\nthat the rights of personal liberty and security protected\nby the Act “includ[ed] the constitutional right to bear\narms.” Ibid.\n                              (3)\n   There is much else in the legislative record. Many\nstatements by Members of Congress corroborate the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause enforced consti\ntutionally enumerated rights against the States. See\nCurtis 112 (collecting examples). I am not aware of any\nstatement that directly refutes that proposition. That\nsaid, the record of the debates—like most legislative his\ntory—is less than crystal clear. In particular, much ambi\nguity derives from the fact that at least several Members\ndescribed §1 as protecting the privileges and immunities\nof citizens “in the several States,” harkening back to Arti\ncle IV, §2. See supra, at 28–29 (describing Sen. Howard’s\nspeech). These statements can be read to support the view\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects some or\nall the fundamental rights of “citizens” described in Cor\nfield. They can also be read to support the view that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause, like Article IV, §2, pro\nhibits only state discrimination with respect to those\nrights it covers, but does not deprive States of the power to\ndeny those rights to all citizens equally.\n   I examine the rest of the historical record with this\nunderstanding. But for purposes of discerning what the\npublic most likely thought the Privileges or Immunities\nClause to mean, it is significant that the most widely\npublicized statements by the legislators who voted on §1—\nBingham, Howard, and even Hale—point unambiguously\n\f32                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\ntoward the conclusion that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause enforces at least those fundamental rights enu\nmerated in the Constitution against the States, including\nthe Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n                               3\n   Interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment in the\nperiod immediately following its ratification help to estab\nlish the public understanding of the text at the time of its\nadoption.\n   Some of these interpretations come from Members of\nCongress. During an 1871 debate on a bill to enforce the\nFourteenth Amendment, Representative Henry Dawes\nlisted the Constitution’s first eight Amendments, includ\ning “the right to keep and bear arms,” before explaining\nthat after the Civil War, the country “gave the most grand\nof all these rights, privileges, and immunities, by one\nsingle amendment to the Constitution, to four millions of\nAmerican citizens” who formerly were slaves. Cong.\nGlobe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 475–476 (1871). “It is all\nthese,” Dawes explained, “which are comprehended in the\nwords ‘American citizen.’ ” Ibid.; see also id., at 334 (re\nmarks of Rep. Hoar) (stating that the Privileges or Immu\nnities Clause referred to those rights “declared to belong to\nthe citizen by the Constitution itself”). Even opponents of\nFourteenth Amendment enforcement legislation acknowl\nedged that the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected\nconstitutionally enumerated individual rights. See 2\nCong. Rec. 384–385 (1874) (remarks of Rep. Mills) (oppos\ning enforcement law, but acknowledging, in referring to\nthe Bill of Rights, that “[t]hese first amendments and\nsome provisions of the Constitution of like import embrace\nthe ‘privileges and immunities’ of citizenship as set forth\nin article 4, section 2 of the Constitution and in the four\nteenth amendment” (emphasis added)); see Curtis 166–170\n(collecting examples).\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

Corbin cited Barron and\ndeclared:\n     “[T]he fourteenth amendment changes all that theory,\n     and lays the same restriction upon the States that be\n     fore lay upon the Congress of the United States—that,\n     as Congress heretofore could not interfere with the\n     right of the citizen to keep and bear arms, now, after\n     the adoption of the fourteenth amendment, the State\n     cannot interfere with the right of the citizen to keep\n     and bear arms. The right to keep and bear arms is in\n     cluded in the fourteenth amendment, under ‘privi\n     leges and immunities.’ ” Proceedings in the Ku Klux\n     Trials at Columbia, S.

As the Court demonstrates, there\ncan be no doubt that §1 was understood to enforce the\nSecond Amendment against the States. See ante, at 22–\n33. In my view, this is because the right to keep and bear\narms was understood to be a privilege of American citizen\nship guaranteed by the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

The municipal re\nspondents, Chicago and Oak Park, argue for the former\ninterpretation. They contend that the Second Amend\nment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth,\nauthorizes a State to impose an outright ban on handgun\npossession such as the ones at issue here so long as a State\napplies it to all citizens equally.15 The Court explains why\nthis antidiscrimination-only reading of §1 as a whole is\n“implausible.” Ante, at 31 (citing Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 64). I agree, but because I think it is the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause that applies this right to\nthe States, I must explain why this Clause in particular\nprotects against more than just state discrimination, and\nin fact establishes a minimum baseline of rights for all\nAmerican citizens.\n                              1\n   I begin, again, with the text. The Privileges or Immuni\nties Clause opens with the command that “No State shall”\nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the\n——————\n   15 The municipal respondents and JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent raise a\n\nmost unusual argument that §1 prohibits discriminatory laws affecting\nonly the right to keep and bear arms, but offers substantive protection\nto other rights enumerated in the Constitution, such as the freedom of\nspeech. See post, at 24. Others, however, have made the more compre\nhensive—and internally consistent—argument that §1 bars discrimina\ntion alone and does not afford protection to any substantive rights. See,\ne.g., R. Berger, Government By Judiciary: The Transformation of the\nFourteenth Amendment (1997). I address the coverage of the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause only as it applies to the Second Amendment\nright presented here, but I do so with the understanding that my\nconclusion may have implications for the broader argument.\n\f36                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nUnited States. Amdt. 14, §1 (emphasis added). The very\nsame phrase opens Article I, §10 of the Constitution,\nwhich prohibits the States from “pass[ing] any Bill of\nAttainder” or “ex post facto Law,” among other things.\nArticle I, §10 is one of the few constitutional provisions\nthat limits state authority. In Barron, when Chief Justice\nMarshall interpreted the Bill of Rights as lacking “plain\nand intelligible language” restricting state power to in\nfringe upon individual liberties, he pointed to Article I, §10\nas an example of text that would have accomplished that\ntask. 7 Pet., at 250. Indeed, Chief Justice Marshall would\nlater describe Article I, §10 as “a bill of rights for the\npeople of each state.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138\n(1810). Thus, the fact that the Privileges or Immunities\nClause uses the command “[n]o State shall”—which Arti\ncle IV, §2 does not—strongly suggests that the former\nimposes a greater restriction on state power than the\nlatter.\n   This interpretation is strengthened when one considers\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause uses the verb\n“abridge,” rather than “discriminate,” to describe the limit\nit imposes on state authority. The Webster’s dictionary in\nuse at the time of Reconstruction defines the word\n“abridge” to mean “[t]o deprive; to cut off; . . . as, to\nabridge one of his rights.” Webster, An American Diction\nary of the English Language, at 6. The Clause is thus best\nunderstood to impose a limitation on state power to in\nfringe upon pre-existing substantive rights. It raises no\nindication that the Framers of the Clause used the word\n“abridge” to prohibit only discrimination.\n   This most natural textual reading is underscored by a\nwell-publicized revision to the Fourteenth Amendment\nthat the Reconstruction Congress rejected. After several\nSouthern States refused to ratify the Amendment, Presi\ndent Johnson met with their Governors to draft a com\npromise. N. Y. Times, Feb. 5, 1867, p. 5. Their proposal\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           37\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\neliminated Congress’ power to enforce the Amendment\n(granted in §5), and replaced the Privileges or Immunities\nClause in §1 with the following:\n    “All persons born or naturalized in the United States,\n    and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of\n    the United States, and of the States in which they re\n    side, and the Citizens of each State shall be entitled to\n    all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the sev\n    eral States.” Draft reprinted in 1 Documentary His\n    tory of Reconstruction 240 (W. Fleming ed. 1950)\n    (hereinafter Fleming).\n  Significantly, this proposal removed the “[n]o State\nshall” directive and the verb “abridge” from §1, and also\nchanged the class of rights to be protected from those\nbelonging to “citizens of the United States” to those of the\n“citizens in the several States.” This phrasing is materi\nally indistinguishable from Article IV, §2, which gener\nally was understood as an antidiscrimination provision\nalone. See supra, at 15–18. The proposal thus strongly\nindicates that at least the President of the United States\nand several southern Governors thought that the Privi\nleges or Immunities Clause, which they unsuccessfully\ntried to revise, prohibited more than just state-sponsored\ndiscrimination.\n                              2\n  The argument that the Privileges or Immunities Clause\nprohibits no more than discrimination often is followed by\na claim that public discussion of the Clause, and of §1\ngenerally, was not extensive. Because of this, the argu\nment goes, §1 must not have been understood to accom\nplish such a significant task as subjecting States to federal\nenforcement of a minimum baseline of rights. That argu\nment overlooks critical aspects of the Nation’s history that\nunderscored the need for, and wide agreement upon,\n\f38                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nfederal enforcement of constitutionally enumerated rights\nagainst the States, including the right to keep and bear\narms.\n                               a\n   I turn first to public debate at the time of ratification. It\nis true that the congressional debates over §1 were rela\ntively brief. It is also true that there is little evidence of\nextensive debate in the States. Many state legislatures\ndid not keep records of their debates, and the few records\nthat do exist reveal only modest discussion. See Curtis\n145. These facts are not surprising.\n   First, however consequential we consider the question\ntoday, the nationalization of constitutional rights was not\nthe most controversial aspect of the Fourteenth Amend\nment at the time of its ratification. The Nation had just\nendured a tumultuous civil war, and §§2, 3, and 4—which\nreduced the representation of States that denied voting\nrights to blacks, deprived most former Confederate officers\nof the power to hold elective office, and required States to\ndisavow Confederate war debts—were far more polarizing\nand consumed far more political attention. See Wilden\nthal 1600; Hardy, Original Popular Understanding of the\nFourteenth Amendment as Reflected in the Print Media of\n1866–1868, 30 Whittier L. Rev. 695, 699 (2009).\n   Second, the congressional debates on the Fourteenth\nAmendment reveal that many representatives, and proba\nbly many citizens, believed that the Thirteenth Amend\nment, the 1866 Civil Rights legislation, or some combina\ntion of the two, had already enforced constitutional rights\nagainst the States. Justice Black’s dissent in Adamson\nchronicles this point in detail. 332 U. S., at 107–108\n(Appendix to dissenting opinion). Regardless of whether\nthat understanding was accurate as a matter of constitu\ntional law, it helps to explain why Congressmen had little\nto say during the debates about §1.

Like the Framers, see supra, at 14–15, many 19th\ncentury Americans understood the Bill of Rights to declare\ninalienable rights that pre-existed all government. Thus,\neven though the Bill of Rights technically applied only to\nthe Federal Government, many believed that it declared\nrights that no legitimate government could abridge.\n   Chief Justice Henry Lumpkin’s decision for the Georgia\nSupreme Court in Nunn v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1846), illus\ntrates this view. In assessing state power to regulate\nfirearm possession, Lumpkin wrote that he was “aware\nthat it has been decided, that [the Second Amendment],\nlike other amendments adopted at the same time, is a\nrestriction upon the government of the United States, and\ndoes not extend to the individual States.” Id., at 250. But\nhe still considered the right to keep and bear arms as “an\nunalienable right, which lies at the bottom of every free\ngovernment,” and thus found the States bound to honor it.\nIbid. Other state courts adopted similar positions with\nrespect to the right to keep and bear arms and other enu\nmerated rights.16 Some courts even suggested that the\nprotections in the Bill of Rights were legally enforceable\nagainst the States, Barron notwithstanding.17 A promi\nnent treatise of the era took the same position.

Spooner,\nThe Unconstitutionality of Slavery 98 (1860).\n   In sum, some appear to have believed that the Bill of\nRights did apply to the States, even though this Court had\nsquarely rejected that theory. See, e.g., supra, at 27–28\n(recounting Rep. Hale’s argument to this effect). Many\nothers believed that the liberties codified in the Bill of\nRights were ones that no State should abridge, even\nthough they understood that the Bill technically did not\napply to States. These beliefs, combined with the fact that\nmost state constitutions recognized many, if not all, of the\nindividual rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, made\nthe need for federal enforcement of constitutional liberties\nagainst the States an afterthought. See ante, at 29 (opin\nion of the Court) (noting that, “[i]n 1868, 22 of the 37\nStates in the Union had state constitutional provisions\nexplicitly protecting the right to keep and bear arms”).\nThat changed with the national conflict over slavery.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

Congressman Tobias Plants explained that\nslaveholders “could not hold [slaves] safely where dissent\nwas permitted,” so they decided that “all dissent must be\nsuppressed by the strong hand of power.” 39th Cong.\nGlobe 1013. The measures they used were ruthless, re\npressed virtually every right recognized in the Constitu\ntion, and demonstrated that preventing only discrimina\ntory state firearms restrictions would have been a hollow\nassurance for liberty. Public reaction indicates that the\nAmerican people understood this point.\n   The overarching goal of pro-slavery forces was to repress\nthe spread of abolitionist thought and the concomitant\nrisk of a slave rebellion. Indeed, it is difficult to overstate\nthe extent to which fear of a slave uprising gripped slave\nholders and dictated the acts of Southern legislatures.\nSlaves and free blacks represented a substantial percent\nage of the population and posed a severe threat to South\nern order if they were not kept in their place. According to\nthe 1860 Census, slaves represented one quarter or more\nof the population in 11 of the 15 slave States, nearly half\nthe population in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisi\nana, and more than 50% of the population in Mississippi\nand South Carolina. Statistics of the United States (In\ncluding Mortality, Property, &c.,) in 1860, The Eighth\nCensus 336−350 (1866).\n   The Southern fear of slave rebellion was not unfounded.\nAlthough there were others, two particularly notable slave\nuprisings heavily influenced slaveholders in the South. In\n1822, a group of free blacks and slaves led by Denmark\nVesey planned a rebellion in which they would slay their\nmasters and flee to Haiti. H. Aptheker, American Negro\n\f42                    MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nSlave Revolts 268–270 (1983). The plan was foiled, lead\ning to the swift arrest of 130 blacks, and the execution of\n37, including Vesey. Id., at 271. Still, slaveowners took\nnotice—it was reportedly feared that as many as 6,600 to\n9,000 slaves and free blacks were involved in the plot. Id.,\nat 272. A few years later, the fear of rebellion was real\nized. An uprising led by Nat Turner took the lives of at\nleast 57 whites before it was suppressed. Id., at 300–302.\n  The fear generated by these and other rebellions led\nSouthern legislatures to take particularly vicious aim at\nthe rights of free blacks and slaves to speak or to keep and\nbear arms for their defense. Teaching slaves to read (even\nthe Bible) was a criminal offense punished severely in\nsome States. See K. Stampp, The Peculiar Institution:\nSlavery in the Ante-bellum South 208, 211 (1956). Vir\nginia made it a crime for a member of an “abolition” soci\nety to enter the State and argue “that the owners of slaves\nhave no property in the same, or advocate or advise the\nabolition of slavery.” 1835–1836 Va. Acts ch. 66, p. 44.\nOther States prohibited the circulation of literature deny\ning a master’s right to property in his slaves and passed\nlaws requiring postmasters to inspect the mails in search\nof such material. C. Eaton, The Freedom-of-Thought\nStruggle in the Old South 118–143, 199–200 (1964).\n  Many legislatures amended their laws prohibiting\nslaves from carrying firearms18 to apply the prohibition to\nfree blacks as well. See, e.g., Act of Dec. 23, 1833, §7, 1833\nGa.

If they found any firearms, the patrols were to take\nthe offending slave or free black “to the nearest justice of\nthe peace,” whereupon he would be “severely punished” by\n“whipping on the bare back, not exceeding thirty-nine\nlashes,” unless he could give a “plain and satisfactory”\nexplanation of how he came to possess the gun. Ibid.\n   Southern blacks were not alone in facing threats to their\npersonal liberty and security during the antebellum era.\nMob violence in many Northern cities presented dangers\nas well.

As Representative\nThaddeus Stevens is reported to have said, “[w]hen it was\nfirst proposed to free the slaves, and arm the blacks, did\nnot half the nation tremble? The prim conservatives, the\nsnobs, and the male waiting-maids in Congress, were in\n\f44                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nhysterics.” K. Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction, 1865–\n1877, p. 104 (1965) (hereinafter Era of Reconstruction).\n   As the Court explains, this fear led to “systematic ef\nforts” in the “old Confederacy” to disarm the more than\n180,000 freedmen who had served in the Union Army, as\nwell as other free blacks. See ante, at 23. Some States\nformally prohibited blacks from possessing firearms. Ante,\nat 23–24 (quoting 1865 Miss. Laws p. 165, §1, reprinted in\n1 Fleming 289). Others enacted legislation prohibiting\nblacks from carrying firearms without a license, a restric\ntion not imposed on whites. See, e.g., La. Statute of 1865,\nreprinted in id., at 280. Additionally, “[t]hroughout the\nSouth, armed parties, often consisting of ex-Confederate\nsoldiers serving in the state militias, forcibly took firearms\nfrom newly freed slaves.” Ante, at 24.\n   As the Court makes crystal clear, if the Fourteenth\nAmendment “had outlawed only those laws that discrimi\nnate on the basis of race or previous condition of servitude,\nAfrican-Americans in the South would likely have re\nmained vulnerable to attack by many of their worst abus\ners: the state militia and state peace officers.” Ante, at 32.\nIn the years following the Civil War, a law banning fire\narm possession outright “would have been nondiscrimina\ntory only in the formal sense,” for it would have “left fire\narms in the hands of the militia and local peace officers.”\nIbid.\n   Evidence suggests that the public understood this at the\ntime the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. The pub\nlicly circulated Report of the Joint Committee on Recon\nstruction extensively detailed these abuses, see ante, at\n23–24 (collecting examples), and statements by citizens\nindicate that they looked to the Committee to provide a\nfederal solution to this problem, see, e.g., 39th Cong. Globe\n337 (remarks of Rep. Sumner) (introducing “a memorial\nfrom the colored citizens of the State of South Carolina”\nasking for, inter alia, “constitutional protection in keeping\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

See, e.g., Jan. 17, 1866, order from Major\nGeneral D. E. Sickles, reprinted in E. McPherson, The\nPolitical History of the United States of America During\nthe Period of Reconstruction 37 (1871) (“The constitutional\nrights of all loyal and well-disposed inhabitants to bear\narms will not be infringed”). The significance of these\nsteps was not lost on those they were designed to protect.\nAfter one such order was issued, The Christian Recorder,\npublished by the African Methodist Episcopal Church,\npublished the following editorial:\n       “ ‘We have several times alluded to the fact that the\n    Constitution of the United States, guaranties to every\n    citizen the right to keep and bear arms. . . . All men,\n    without the distinction of color, have the right to keep\n    arms to defend their homes, families, or themselves.’\n       “We are glad to learn that [the] Commissioner for\n    this State . . . has given freedmen to understand that\n    they have as good a right to keep fire arms as any\n    other citizens.

We answer certainly you have the same\n    right to own and carry fire arms that other citizens\n    have.

See, e.g., J. Tiffany, Treatise on the\nUnconstitutionality of American Slavery 56 (1849) (reprint\n1969) (“pledg[ing] . . . to see that all the rights, privileges,\nand immunities, granted by the constitution of the United\nStates, are extended to all”); id., at 99 (describing the\n“right to keep and bear arms” as one of those rights se\ncured by “the constitution of the United States”). The\nproblem abolitionists sought to remedy was that, under\nDred Scott, blacks were not entitled to the privileges and\nimmunities of citizens under the Federal Constitution and\nthat, in many States, whatever inalienable rights state\nlaw recognized did not apply to blacks.

As Frederick Douglass explained before §1’s\nadoption, “the Legislatures of the South can take from him\nthe right to keep and bear arms, as they can—they would\nnot allow a negro to walk with a cane where I came from,\nthey would not allow five of them to assemble together.”\nIn What New Skin Will the Old Snake Come Forth?

McKivigan eds., 1991) (footnote\nomitted). “Notwithstanding the provision in the Constitu\ntion of the United States, that the right to keep and bear\narms shall not be abridged,” Douglass explained that “the\nblack man has never had the right either to keep or bear\narms.” Id., at 84. Absent a constitutional amendment to\nenforce that right against the States, he insisted that “the\nwork of the Abolitionists [wa]s not finished.” Ibid.\n   This history confirms what the text of the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause most naturally suggests: Consistent\nwith its command that “[n]o State shall . . . abridge” the\nrights of United States citizens, the Clause establishes a\nminimum baseline of federal rights, and the constitutional\nright to keep and bear arms plainly was among them.19\n                           III\n  My conclusion is contrary to this Court’s precedents,\nwhich hold that the Second Amendment right to keep and\nbear arms is not a privilege of United States citizenship.\n——————\n  19 Iconclude that the right to keep and bear arms applies to the\nStates through the Privileges or Immunities Clause, which recognizes\nthe rights of United States “citizens.” The plurality concludes that the\nright applies to the States through the Due Process Clause, which\ncovers all “person[s].” Because this case does not involve a claim\nbrought by a noncitizen, I express no view on the difference, if any,\nbetween my conclusion and the plurality’s with respect to the extent to\nwhich the States may regulate firearm possession by noncitizens.\n\f48                     MCDONALD v.

I must,\ntherefore, consider whether stare decisis requires reten\ntion of those precedents. As mentioned at the outset, my\ninquiry is limited to the right at issue here. Thus, I do not\nendeavor to decide in this case whether, or to what extent,\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause applies any other\nrights enumerated in the Constitution against the\nStates.20 Nor do I suggest that the stare decisis considera\ntions surrounding the application of the right to keep and\nbear arms against the States would be the same as those\nsurrounding another right protected by the Privileges or\nImmunities Clause. I consider stare decisis only as it\napplies to the question presented here.\n                              A\n  This inquiry begins with the Slaughter-House Cases.\nThere, this Court upheld a Louisiana statute granting a\nmonopoly on livestock butchering in and around the city of\nNew Orleans to a newly incorporated company. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Constitutional provisions outside the Bill of Rights\nprotect individual rights, see, e.g., Art. I, §9, cl. 2 (granting the “Privi\nlege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus”), and there is no obvious evidence\nthat the Framers of the Privileges or Immunities Clause meant to\nexclude them. In addition, certain Bill of Rights provisions prevent\nfederal interference in state affairs and are not readily construed as\nprotecting rights that belong to individuals. The Ninth and Tenth\nAmendments are obvious examples, as is the First Amendment’s\nEstablishment Clause, which “does not purport to protect individual\nrights.” Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v.

The Court held that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause protected only rights of\nfederal citizenship—those “which owe their existence to\nthe Federal government, its National character, its Con\nstitution, or its laws,” id., at 79—and did not protect any\nof the rights of state citizenship, id., at 74. In other\nwords, the Court defined the two sets of rights as mutually\nexclusive.\n   After separating these two sets of rights, the Court\ndefined the rights of state citizenship as “embrac[ing]\nnearly every civil right for the establishment and protec\ntion of which organized government is instituted”—that is,\nall those rights listed in Corfield. 16 Wall., at 76 (refer\nring to “those rights” that “Judge Washington” described).\nThat left very few rights of federal citizenship for the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause to protect. The Court\nsuggested a handful of possibilities, such as the “right of\nfree access to [federal] seaports,” protection of the Federal\nGovernment while traveling “on the high seas,” and even\ntwo rights listed in the Constitution. Id., at 79 (noting\n“[t]he right to peaceably assemble” and “the privilege of\nthe writ of habeas corpus”); see supra, at 4. But its deci\nsion to interpret the rights of state and federal citizenship\nas mutually exclusive led the Court in future cases to\nconclude that constitutionally enumerated rights were\nexcluded from the Privileges or Immunities Clause’s scope.\nSee Cruikshank, supra.\n   I reject that understanding. There was no reason to\ninterpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause as putting\nthe Court to the extreme choice of interpreting the “privi\nleges and immunities” of federal citizenship to mean ei\nther all those rights listed in Corfield, or almost no rights\nat all. 16 Wall., at 76. The record is scant that the public\nunderstood the Clause to make the Federal Government\n“a perpetual censor upon all legislation of the States” as\n\f50                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nthe Slaughter-House majority feared. Id., at 78. For one\nthing, Corfield listed the “elective franchise” as one of the\nprivileges and immunities of “citizens of the several\nstates,” 6 F. Cas., at 552, yet Congress and the States still\nfound it necessary to adopt the Fifteenth Amendment—\nwhich protects “[t]he right of citizens of the United States\nto vote”—two years after the Fourteenth Amendment’s\npassage. If the Privileges or Immunities Clause were\nunderstood to protect every conceivable civil right from\nstate abridgment, the Fifteenth Amendment would have\nbeen redundant.\n   The better view, in light of the States and Federal Gov\nernment’s shared history of recognizing certain inalienable\nrights in their citizens, is that the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship overlap. This is not to\nsay that the privileges and immunities of state and federal\ncitizenship are the same. At the time of the Fourteenth\nAmendment’s ratification, States performed many more\nfunctions than the Federal Government, and it is unlikely\nthat, simply by referring to “privileges or immunities,” the\nFramers of §1 meant to transfer every right mentioned in\nCorfield to congressional oversight. As discussed, “privi\nleges” and “immunities” were understood only as syno\nnyms for “rights.” See supra, at 9–11. It was their at\ntachment to a particular group that gave them content,\nand the text and history recounted here indicate that the\nrights of United States citizens were not perfectly identi\ncal to the rights of citizens “in the several States.” Justice\nSwayne, one of the dissenters in Slaughter-House, made\nthe point clear:\n     “The citizen of a State has the same fundamental\n     rights as a citizen of the United States, and also cer\n     tain others, local in their character, arising from his\n     relation to the State, and in addition, those which be\n     long to the citizen of the United States, he being in\n\f                     Cite as: 561 U.

There may thus be a double citi\n     zenship, each having some rights peculiar to itself. It\n     is only over those which belong to the citizen of the\n     United States that the category here in question\n     throws the shield of its protection.” 16 Wall., at 126\n     (emphasis added).\nBecause the privileges and immunities of American citi\nzenship include rights enumerated in the Constitution,\nthey overlap to at least some extent with the privileges\nand immunities traditionally recognized in citizens in the\nseveral States.\n  A separate question is whether the privileges and im\nmunities of American citizenship include any rights be\nsides those enumerated in the Constitution. The four\ndissenting Justices in Slaughter-House would have held\nthat the Privileges or Immunities Clause protected the\nunenumerated right that the butchers in that case as\nserted. See id., at 83 (Field, J., dissenting); id., at 111\n(Bradley, J., dissenting); id., at 124 (Swayne, J., dissent\ning). Because this case does not involve an unenumerated\nright, it is not necessary to resolve the question whether\nthe Clause protects such rights, or whether the Court’s\njudgment in Slaughter-House was correct.\n  Still, it is argued that the mere possibility that the\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may enforce unenumer\nated rights against the States creates “ ‘special hazards’ ”\nthat should prevent this Court from returning to the\noriginal meaning of the Clause.21 Post, at 3 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting). Ironically, the same objection applies to the\n\n——————\n   21 To the extent JUSTICE STEVENS is concerned that reliance on the\n\nPrivileges or Immunities Clause may invite judges to “write their\npersonal views of appropriate public policy into the Constitution,” post,\nat 3 (internal quotation marks omitted), his celebration of the alterna\ntive—the “flexibility,” “transcend[ence],” and “dynamism” of substan\ntive due process—speaks for itself, post, at 14–15, 20.\n\f52                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\nCourt’s substantive due process jurisprudence, which\nillustrates the risks of granting judges broad discretion to\nrecognize individual constitutional rights in the absence of\ntextual or historical guideposts. But I see no reason to\nassume that such hazards apply to the Privileges or Im\nmunities Clause. The mere fact that the Clause does not\nexpressly list the rights it protects does not render it\nincapable of principled judicial application. The Constitu\ntion contains many provisions that require an examination\nof more than just constitutional text to determine whether\na particular act is within Congress’ power or is otherwise\nprohibited. See, e.g., Art. I, §8, cl. 18 (Necessary and\nProper Clause); Amdt. 8 (Cruel and Unusual Punishments\nClause). When the inquiry focuses on what the ratifying\nera understood the Privileges or Immunities Clause to\nmean, interpreting it should be no more “hazardous” than\ninterpreting these other constitutional provisions by using\nthe same approach. To be sure, interpreting the Privileges\nor Immunities Clause may produce hard questions. But\nthey will have the advantage of being questions the Con\nstitution asks us to answer. I believe those questions are\nmore worthy of this Court’s attention—and far more likely\nto yield discernable answers—than the substantive due\nprocess questions the Court has for years created on its\nown, with neither textual nor historical support.\n   Finding these impediments to returning to the original\nmeaning overstated, I reject Slaughter-House insofar as it\nprecludes any overlap between the privileges and immuni\nties of state and federal citizenship. I next proceed to the\nstare decisis considerations surrounding the precedent\nthat expressly controls the question presented here.\n                            B\n  Three years after Slaughter-House, the Court in Cruik\nshank squarely held that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas not a privilege of American citizenship, thereby over\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

Cruik\nshank is not a precedent entitled to any respect. The flaws\nin its interpretation of the Privileges or Immunities\nClause are made evident by the preceding evidence of its\noriginal meaning, and I would reject the holding on that\nbasis alone. But, the consequences of Cruikshank warrant\nmention as well.\n   Cruikshank’s holding that blacks could look only to state\ngovernments for protection of their right to keep and bear\narms enabled private forces, often with the assistance of\nlocal governments, to subjugate the newly freed slaves and\ntheir descendants through a wave of private violence\ndesigned to drive blacks from the voting booth and force\nthem into peonage, an effective return to slavery. Without\nfederal enforcement of the inalienable right to keep and\nbear arms, these militias and mobs were tragically suc\ncessful in waging a campaign of terror against the very\npeople the Fourteenth Amendment had just made citizens.\n   Take, for example, the Hamburg Massacre of 1876.\nThere, a white citizen militia sought out and murdered a\ntroop of black militiamen for no other reason than that\nthey had dared to conduct a celebratory Fourth of July\nparade through their mostly black town. The white mili\ntia commander, “Pitchfork” Ben Tillman, later described\nthis massacre with pride: “[T]he leading white men of\nEdgefield” had decided “to seize the first opportunity that\nthe negroes might offer them to provoke a riot and teach\nthe negroes a lesson by having the whites demonstrate\ntheir superiority by killing as many of them as was justifi\nable.” S. Kantrowitz, Ben Tillman & the Reconstruction of\nWhite Supremacy 67 (2000) (ellipsis, brackets, and inter\nnal quotation marks omitted). None of the perpetrators of\nthe Hamburg murders was ever brought to justice.22\n——————\n 22 Tillman   went on to a long career as South Carolina’s Governor and,\n\f54                      MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                          Opinion of THOMAS, J.\n\n   Organized terrorism like that perpetuated by Tillman\nand his cohorts proliferated in the absence of federal\nenforcement of constitutional rights. Militias such as the\nKu Klux Klan, the Knights of the White Camellia, the\nWhite Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and the ’76 Associa\ntion spread terror among blacks and white Republicans by\nbreaking up Republican meetings, threatening political\nleaders, and whipping black militiamen. Era of Recon\nstruction, 199–200; Curtis 156. These groups raped,\nmurdered, lynched, and robbed as a means of intimidat\ning, and instilling pervasive fear in, those whom they\ndespised. A. Trelease, White Terror: The Ku Klux Klan\nConspiracy and Southern Reconstruction 28–46 (1995).\n   Although Congress enacted legislation to suppress these\nactivities,23 Klan tactics remained a constant presence in\nthe lives of Southern blacks for decades. Between 1882\nand 1968, there were at least 3,446 reported lynchings of\nblacks in the South. Cottrol 351–352. They were tortured\nand killed for a wide array of alleged crimes, without even\nthe slightest hint of due process.

As Eli Cooper, one target of such violence, is said\nto have explained, “ ‘[t]he Negro has been run over for fifty\nyears, but it must stop now, and pistols and shotguns are\nthe only weapons to stop a mob.’ ” Church Burnings Fol\nlow Negro Agitator’s Lynching, Chicago Defender, Sept. 6,\n1919, in id., at 124. Sometimes, as in Cooper’s case, self\ndefense did not succeed. He was dragged from his home\nby a mob and killed as his wife looked on. Ibid. But at\nother times, the use of firearms allowed targets of mob\nviolence to survive. One man recalled the night during his\nchildhood when his father stood armed at a jail until\nmorning to ward off lynchers. See Cottrol, 354. The ex\nperience left him with a sense, “not ‘of powerlessness, but\nof the “possibilities of salvation” ’ ” that came from stand\ning up to intimidation. Ibid.\n  In my view, the record makes plain that the Framers of\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause and the ratifying-era\npublic understood—just as the Framers of the Second\nAmendment did—that the right to keep and bear arms\nwas essential to the preservation of liberty. The record\nmakes equally plain that they deemed this right necessary\nto include in the minimum baseline of federal rights that\nthe Privileges or Immunities Clause established in the\nwake of the War over slavery.

That principle has little rele­\nvance to the question whether a nonprocedural rule set\nforth in the Bill of Rights qualifies as an aspect of the lib­\nerty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   Notwithstanding some overheated dicta in Malloy, 378\nU. S., at 10–11, it is therefore an overstatement to say\nthat the Court has “abandoned,” ante, at 16, 17 (majority\nopinion), 39 (plurality opinion), a “two-track approach to\nincorporation,” ante, at 37 (plurality opinion). The Court\nmoved away from that approach in the area of criminal\nprocedure. But the Second Amendment differs in funda­\nmental respects from its neighboring provisions in the Bill\nof Rights, as I shall explain in Part V, infra; and if some\n1960’s opinions purported to establish a general method of\nincorporation, that hardly binds us in this case. The Court\nhas not hesitated to cut back on perceived Warren Court\nexcesses in more areas than I can count.\n   I do not mean to deny that there can be significant\npractical, as well as esthetic, benefits from treating rights\nsymmetrically with regard to the State and Federal Gov­\nernments. Jot-for-jot incorporation of a provision may\nentail greater protection of the right at issue and therefore\ngreater freedom for those who hold it; jot-for-jot incorpora­\ntion may also yield greater clarity about the contours of\nthe legal rule. See Johnson v.

The costs of federal courts’\nimposing a uniform national standard may be especially\nhigh when the relevant regulatory interests vary signifi­\ncantly across localities, and when the ruling implicates the\nStates’ core police powers.\n  Furthermore, there is a real risk that, by demanding the\nprovisions of the Bill of Rights apply identically to the\nStates, federal courts will cause those provisions to “be\nwatered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity.”\nDuncan v.

When one legal standard must\nprevail across dozens of jurisdictions with disparate needs\nand customs, courts will often settle on a relaxed stan­\ndard. This watering-down risk is particularly acute when\nwe move beyond the narrow realm of criminal procedure\nand into the relatively vast domain of substantive rights.\nSo long as the requirements of fundamental fairness are\nalways and everywhere respected, it is not clear that\ngreater liberty results from the jot-for-jot application of a\nprovision of the Bill of Rights to the States.

Implicit in Justice Cardozo’s test is a recognition\nthat the postulates of liberty have a universal character.\nLiberty claims that are inseparable from the customs that\nprevail in a certain region, the idiosyncratic expectations\nof a certain group, or the personal preferences of their\nchampions, may be valid claims in some sense; but they\nare not of constitutional stature. Whether conceptualized\nas a “rational continuum” of legal precepts, Poe, 367 U. S.,\nat 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting), or a seamless web of moral\ncommitments, the rights embraced by the liberty clause\ntranscend the local and the particular.\n   Justice Cardozo’s test undeniably requires judges to\napply their own reasoned judgment, but that does not\nmean it involves an exercise in abstract philosophy. In\naddition to other constraints I will soon discuss, see Part\nIII, infra, historical and empirical data of various kinds\nground the analysis. Textual commitments laid down\nelsewhere in the Constitution, judicial precedents, English\ncommon law, legislative and social facts, scientific and\nprofessional developments, practices of other civilized\nsocieties,15 and, above all else, the “ ‘traditions and con­\nscience of our people,’ ” Palko, 302 U.

They can provide evidence about which\nrights really are vital to ordered liberty, as well as a spur\nto judicial action.\n   The Court errs both in its interpretation of Palko and in\nits suggestion that later cases rendered Palko’s methodol­\nogy defunct.

Palko does contain some language that could be\nread to set an inordinate bar to substantive due process\nrecognition, reserving it for practices without which “nei­\nther liberty nor justice would exist.” 302 U. S., at 326.\nBut in view of Justice Cardozo’s broader analysis, as well\nas the numerous cases that have upheld liberty claims\nunder the Palko standard, such readings are plainly over­\nreadings. We have never applied Palko in such a draco­\nnian manner.\n   Nor, as the Court intimates, see ante, at 16, did Duncan\nmark an irreparable break from Palko, swapping out\nliberty for history. Duncan limited its discussion to “par­\nticular procedural safeguard[s]” in the Bill of Rights relat­\ning to “criminal processes,” 391 U. S., at 149, n. 14; it did\nnot purport to set a standard for other types of liberty\ninterests. Even with regard to procedural safeguards,\nDuncan did not jettison the Palko test so much as refine it:\nThe judge is still tasked with evaluating whether a prac­\ntice “is fundamental . . . to ordered liberty,” within the\ncontext of the “Anglo-American” system. Duncan, 391\nU. S., at 149–150, n. 14. Several of our most important\nrecent decisions confirm the proposition that substantive\ndue process analysis—from which, once again, “incorpora­\ntion” analysis derives—must not be wholly backward\nlooking.

The Court hinges its entire\ndecision on one mode of intellectual history, culling se­\nlected pronouncements and enactments from the 18th and\n19th centuries to ascertain what Americans thought about\nfirearms. Relying on Duncan and Glucksberg, the plural­\nity suggests that only interests that have proved “funda­\nmental from an American perspective,” ante, at 37, 44, or\n“ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,’ ”\nante, at 19 (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721), to the\nCourt’s satisfaction, may qualify for incorporation into the\nFourteenth Amendment. To the extent the Court’s opin­\nion could be read to imply that the historical pedigree of a\nright is the exclusive or dispositive determinant of its\nstatus under the Due Process Clause, the opinion is seri­\nously mistaken.\n   A rigid historical test is inappropriate in this case, most\nbasically, because our substantive due process doctrine\nhas never evaluated substantive rights in purely, or even\npredominantly, historical terms. When the Court applied\nmany of the procedural guarantees in the Bill of Rights to\nthe States in the 1960’s, it often asked whether the guar­\nantee in question was “fundamental in the context of the\ncriminal processes maintained by the American States.”17\n——————\n  16 I acknowledge that some have read the Court’s opinion in Glucks­\nberg as an attempt to move substantive due process analysis, for all\npurposes, toward an exclusively historical methodology—and thereby to\ndebilitate the doctrine. If that were ever Glucksberg’s aspiration,\nLawrence plainly renounced it. As between Glucksberg and Lawrence, I\nhave little doubt which will prove the more enduring precedent.\n  17 The Court almost never asked whether the guarantee in question\n\nwas deeply rooted in founding-era practice. See Brief for Respondent\nCity of Chicago et al. 31, n. 17 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents’\nBrief) (noting that only two opinions extensively discussed such his­\ntory).\n\f18                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nDuncan, 391 U. S., at 150, n. 14. That inquiry could ex­\ntend back through time, but it was focused not so much on\nhistorical conceptions of the guarantee as on its functional\nsignificance within the States’ regimes. This contextual­\nized approach made sense, as the choice to employ any\ngiven trial-type procedure means little in the abstract. It\nis only by inquiring into how that procedure intermeshes\nwith other procedures and practices in a criminal justice\nsystem that its relationship to “liberty” and “due process”\ncan be determined.\n   Yet when the Court has used the Due Process Clause to\nrecognize rights distinct from the trial context—rights\nrelating to the primary conduct of free individuals—\nJustice Cardozo’s test has been our guide. The right to\nfree speech, for instance, has been safeguarded from state\ninfringement not because the States have always honored\nit, but because it is “essential to free government” and “to\nthe maintenance of democratic institutions”—that is,\nbecause the right to free speech is implicit in the concept\nof ordered liberty.

Where we part\nways is in his view that courts should be guided only by historical\nconsiderations.\n  There is, moreover, a tension between JUSTICE SCALIA’s concern that\n“courts have the last word” on constitutional questions, ante, at 3, n. 2,\non the one hand, and his touting of the Constitution’s Article V amend­\nment process, ante, at 3, on the other.

The Framers did not express a clear understand­\ning of the term to guide us, and the now-repudiated\nLochner line of cases attests to the dangers of judicial\noverconfidence in using substantive due process to ad­\nvance a broad theory of the right or the good.

It\ntakes that right, to a considerable extent, “outside the\narena of public debate and legislative action.” Glucksberg,\n521 U. S., at 720. Sometimes that momentous step must\nbe taken; some fundamental aspects of personhood, dig­\nnity, and the like do not vary from State to State, and\ndemand a baseline level of protection. But sensitivity to\nthe interaction between the intrinsic aspects of liberty and\nthe practical realities of contemporary society provides an\nimportant tool for guiding judicial discretion.\n   This sensitivity is an aspect of a deeper principle: the\nneed to approach our work with humility and caution.\nBecause the relevant constitutional language is so “spa­\ncious,” Duncan, 391 U.

S.,\nat 542 (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   Several rules of the judicial process help enforce such\nrestraint. In the substantive due process field as in oth­\ners, the Court has applied both the doctrine of stare de­\ncisis—adhering to precedents, respecting reliance inter­\nests, prizing stability and order in the law—and the\ncommon-law method—taking cases and controversies as\nthey present themselves, proceeding slowly and incremen­\ntally, building on what came before. This restrained\nmethodology was evident even in the heyday of “incorpora­\ntion” during the 1960’s. Although it would have been\nmuch easier for the Court simply to declare certain\nAmendments in the Bill of Rights applicable to the States\nin toto, the Court took care to parse each Amendment into\nits component guarantees, evaluating them one by one.\nThis piecemeal approach allowed the Court to scrutinize\nmore closely the right at issue in any given dispute, reduc­\ning both the risk and the cost of error.\n   Relatedly, rather than evaluate liberty claims on an\nabstract plane, the Court has “required in substantive­\ndue-process cases a ‘careful description’ of the asserted\nfundamental liberty interest.” Glucksberg, 521 U.

The city of Chicago allows resi­\ndents to keep functional firearms, so long as they are\nregistered, but it generally prohibits the possession of\nhandguns, sawed-off shotguns, machine guns, and short­\nbarreled rifles. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code §8–20–\n050 (2009).27 Petitioners’ complaint centered on their\ndesire to keep a handgun at their domicile—it references\nthe “home” in nearly every paragraph, see Complaint ¶¶3–\n4, 11–30, 32, 34, 37, 42, 44, 46, App. 17, 19–26—as did\ntheir supporting declarations, see, e.g., App. 34, 36, 40, 43,\n49–52, 54–56. Petitioners now frame the question that\nconfronts us as “[w]hether the Second Amendment right to\nkeep and bear arms is incorporated as against the States\nby the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities\nor Due Process Clauses.” Brief for Petitioners, p. i. But it\nis our duty “to focus on the allegations in the complaint to\ndetermine how petitioner describes the constitutional\nright at stake,” Collins, 503 U. S., at 125, and the\ngravamen of this complaint is plainly an appeal to keep a\nhandgun or other firearm of one’s choosing in the home.\n   Petitioners’ framing of their complaint tracks the\nCourt’s ruling in Heller. The majority opinion contained\nsome dicta suggesting the possibility of a more expansive\n——————\nAmendment claim.\n   27 The village of Oak Park imposes more stringent restrictions that\n\nmay raise additional complications. See ante, at 2 (majority opinion)\n(quoting Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code §§27–2–1 (2007), 27–1–1\n(2009)).

The distinction between\nthe liberty right these petitioners have asserted and the\nSecond Amendment right identified in Heller is therefore\nevanescent. Both are rooted to the home. Moreover, even\nif both rights have the logical potential to extend further,\nupon “future evaluation,” Heller, 554 U.

It is comparable, in some ways, to\ndecisions about the education and upbringing of one’s\nchildren. For it is the kind of decision that may have\nprofound consequences for every member of the family,\nand for the world beyond.

The historical case for\nregulation is likewise stronger outside the home, as many\nStates have for many years imposed stricter, and less\ncontroversial, restrictions on the carriage of arms than on\ntheir domestic possession. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at\n54) (noting that “the majority of the 19th-century courts to\nconsider the question held that prohibitions on carrying\nconcealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amend­\nment or state analogues”); English v.

Having unleashed in Heller a tsunami of legal\nuncertainty, and thus litigation,30 and now on the cusp of\nimposing a national rule on the States in this area for the\nfirst time in United States history, the Court could at least\nmoderate the confusion, upheaval, and burden on the\nStates by adopting a rule that is clearly and tightly\n——————\n  30 See  Municipal Respondents’ Brief 20, n. 11 (stating that at least\n156 Second Amendment challenges were brought in time between\nHeller’s issuance and brief’s filing); Brady Center Brief 3 (stating that\nover 190 Second Amendment challenges were brought in first 18\nmonths since Heller); Brief for Villages of Winnetka and Skokie, Illi­\nnois, et al. as Amici Curiae 15 (stating that, in wake of Heller, munici­\npalities have “repealed longstanding handgun laws to avoid costly\nlitigation”).\n\f32                     MCDONALD v.

S.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 56). And it is true that if a State were\nto try to deprive its residents of any reasonable means of\ndefending themselves from imminent physical threats, or\nto deny persons any ability to assert self-defense in re­\nsponse to criminal prosecution, that might pose a signifi­\ncant constitutional problem. The argument that there is a\nsubstantive due process right to be spared such untenable\ndilemmas is a serious one.32\n——————\n  31 See, e.g., Brief for Professors of Philosophy, Criminology, Law, and\nOther Fields as Amici Curiae; Brief for International Law Enforcement\nEducators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae 29–45; Brief\nfor 34 California District Attorneys et al. as Amici Curiae 12–31.\n  32 The argument that this Court should establish any such right,\n\nhowever, faces steep hurdles. All 50 States already recognize self­\ndefense as a defense to criminal prosecution, see 2 P. Robinson, Crimi­\nnal Law Defenses §132, p. 96 (1984 and Supp. 2009), so this is hardly\nan interest to which the democratic process has been insensitive. And\nthe States have always diverged on how exactly to implement this\ninterest, so there is wide variety across the Nation in the types and\namounts of force that may be used, the necessity of retreat, the rights of\naggressors, the availability of the “castle doctrine,” and so forth. See\nBrief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for Handgun Control as Amicus\nCuriae 9–21; Brief for American Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 17–19; 2\nW. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law §10.4, pp. 142–160 (2d ed. 2003).\nSuch variation is presumed to be a healthy part of our federalist\nsystem, as the States and localities select different rules in light of\ndifferent priorities, customs, and conditions.\n  As a historical and theoretical matter, moreover, the legal status of\nself-defense is far more complicated than it might first appear. We\nhave generally understood Fourteenth Amendment “liberty” as some­\nthing one holds against direct state interference, whereas a personal\nright of self-defense runs primarily against other individuals; absent\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

Petitioners have not\nasked that we establish a constitutional right to individual\nself-defense; neither their pleadings in the District Court\nnor their filings in this Court make any such request. Nor\ndo petitioners contend that the city of Chicago—which,\nrecall, allows its residents to keep most rifles and shot­\nguns, and to keep them loaded—has unduly burdened any\nsuch right. What petitioners have asked is that we “incor­\nporate” the Second Amendment and thereby establish a\nconstitutional entitlement, enforceable against the States,\nto keep a handgun in the home.\n  Of course, owning a handgun may be useful for practic­\ning self-defense. But the right to take a certain type of\naction is analytically distinct from the right to acquire and\nutilize specific instrumentalities in furtherance of that\naction. And while some might favor handguns, it is not\n——————\ngovernment tyranny, it is only when the state has failed to interfere\nwith (violent) private conduct that self-help becomes potentially neces­\nsary. Moreover, it was a basic tenet of founding-era political philosophy\nthat, in entering civil society and gaining “the advantages of mutual\ncommerce” and the protections of the rule of law, one had to relinquish,\nto a significant degree, “that wild and savage liberty” one possessed in\nthe state of nature. 1 W.

See, e.g., Brief of Historians on Early\nAmerican Legal, Constitutional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici\nCuriae 6–13 (discussing Whig and Quaker theories). Just because\nthere may be a natural or common-law right to some measure of self­\ndefense, it hardly follows that States may not place substantial restric­\ntions on its exercise or that this Court should recognize a constitutional\nright to the same.\n\f34                     MCDONALD v.

The notion that a right of self-defense\nimplies an auxiliary right to own a certain type of firearm\npresupposes not only controversial judgments about the\nstrength and scope of the (posited) self-defense right, but\nalso controversial assumptions about the likely effects\nof making that type of firearm more broadly available. It\nis a very long way from the proposition that the Four­\nteenth Amendment protects a basic individual right of\nself-defense to the conclusion that a city may not ban\nhandguns.33\n  In short, while the utility of firearms, and handguns in\nparticular, to the defense of hearth and home is certainly\nrelevant to an assessment of petitioners’ asserted right,\nthere is no freestanding self-defense claim in this case.\nThe question we must decide is whether the interest in\nkeeping in the home a firearm of one’s choosing—a hand­\ngun, for petitioners—is one that is “comprised within the\nterm liberty” in the Fourteenth Amendment. Whitney, 274\nU. S., at 373 (Brandeis, J., concurring).\n\n\n——————\n  33 The Second Amendment right identified in Heller is likewise clearly\n\ndistinct from a right to protect oneself. In my view, the Court badly\nmisconstrued the Second Amendment in linking it to the value of\npersonal self-defense above and beyond the functioning of the state\nmilitias; as enacted, the Second Amendment was concerned with\ntyrants and invaders, and paradigmatically with the federal military,\nnot with criminals and intruders. But even still, the Court made clear\nthat self-defense plays a limited role in determining the scope and\nsubstance of the Amendment’s guarantee. The Court struck down the\nDistrict of Columbia’s handgun ban not because of the utility of hand­\nguns for lawful self-defense, but rather because of their popularity for\nthat purpose. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–58). And the Court’s\ncommon-use gloss on the Second Amendment right, see id., at ___ (slip\nop., at 55), as well as its discussion of permissible limitations on the\nright, id., at ___ (slip op., at 54–55), had little to do with self-defense.\n\f                    Cite as: 561 U.

But I cannot accept petitioners’\nbroader submission. A number of factors, taken together,\nlead me to this conclusion.\n   First, firearms have a fundamentally ambivalent rela­\ntionship to liberty. Just as they can help homeowners\ndefend their families and property from intruders, they\ncan help thugs and insurrectionists murder innocent\nvictims. The threat that firearms will be misused is far\nfrom hypothetical, for gun crime has devastated many of\nour communities. Amici calculate that approximately one\nmillion Americans have been wounded or killed by gunfire\nin the last decade.34 Urban areas such as Chicago suffer\ndisproportionately from this epidemic of violence. Hand­\nguns contribute disproportionately to it. Just as some\nhomeowners may prefer handguns because of their small\nsize, light weight, and ease of operation, some criminals\nwill value them for the same reasons. See Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 32–33).\nIn recent years, handguns were reportedly used in more\nthan four-fifths of firearm murders and more than half of\n\n\n——————\n  34 Brady  Center Brief 11 (extrapolating from Government statistics);\nsee also Brief for American Public Health Association et al. as Amici\nCuriae 6–7 (reporting estimated social cost of firearm-related violence\nof $100 billion per year).\n\f36                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nall murders nationwide.35\n   Hence, in evaluating an asserted right to be free from\nparticular gun-control regulations, liberty is on both sides\nof the equation. Guns may be useful for self-defense, as\nwell as for hunting and sport, but they also have a unique\npotential to facilitate death and destruction and thereby to\ndestabilize ordered liberty. Your interest in keeping and\nbearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest in\nbeing and feeling safe from armed violence. And while\ngranting you the right to own a handgun might make you\nsafer on any given day—assuming the handgun’s marginal\ncontribution to self-defense outweighs its marginal contri­\nbution to the risk of accident, suicide, and criminal mis­\nchief—it may make you and the community you live in\nless safe overall, owing to the increased number of hand­\nguns in circulation. It is at least reasonable for a democ­\nratically elected legislature to take such concerns into\naccount in considering what sorts of regulations would\nbest serve the public welfare.\n   The practical impact of various gun-control measures\nmay be highly controversial, but this basic insight should\nnot be. The idea that deadly weapons pose a distinctive\nthreat to the social order—and that reasonable restric­\ntions on their usage therefore impose an acceptable bur­\nden on one’s personal liberty—is as old as the Republic.\nAs THE CHIEF JUSTICE observed just the other day, it is a\nfoundational premise of modern government that the\nState holds a monopoly on legitimate violence: “A basic\nstep in organizing a civilized society is to take [the] sword\nout of private hands and turn it over to an organized\ngovernment, acting on behalf of all the people.” Robertson\n——————\n   35 Bogus, Gun Control and America’s Cities: Public Policy and Poli­\n\ntics, 1 Albany Govt.

The same holds true for the hand­\ngun. The power a man has in the state of nature “of doing\nwhatsoever he thought fit for the preservation of himself\nand the rest of mankind, he gives up,” to a significant\nextent, “to be regulated by laws made by the society.”\nJ. Locke, Second Treatise of Civil Government §129, p. 64\n(J. Gough ed. 1947).\n   Limiting the federal constitutional right to keep and\nbear arms to the home complicates the analysis but does\nnot dislodge this conclusion. Even though the Court has\nlong afforded special solicitude for the privacy of the home,\nwe have never understood that principle to “infring[e]\nupon” the authority of the States to proscribe certain\ninherently dangerous items, for “[i]n such cases, compel­\nling reasons may exist for overriding the right of the indi­\nvidual to possess those materials.” Stanley, 394 U. S., at\n568, n. 11. And, of course, guns that start out in the home\nmay not stay in the home. Even if the government has a\nweaker basis for restricting domestic possession of fire­\narms as compared to public carriage—and even if a blan­\nket, statewide prohibition on domestic possession might\ntherefore be unconstitutional—the line between the two is\na porous one. A state or local legislature may determine\nthat a prophylactic ban on an especially portable weapon\nis necessary to police that line.\n   Second, the right to possess a firearm of one’s choosing\nis different in kind from the liberty interests we have\nrecognized under the Due Process Clause. Despite the\nplethora of substantive due process cases that have been\ndecided in the post-Lochner century, I have found none\nthat holds, states, or even suggests that the term “liberty”\nencompasses either the common-law right of self-defense\nor a right to keep and bear arms. I do not doubt for a\nmoment that many Americans feel deeply passionate\nabout firearms, and see them as critical to their way of life\n\f38                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nas well as to their security. Nevertheless, it does not\nappear to be the case that the ability to own a handgun, or\nany particular type of firearm, is critical to leading a life of\nautonomy, dignity, or political equality: The marketplace\noffers many tools for self-defense, even if they are imper­\nfect substitutes, and neither petitioners nor their amici\nmake such a contention. Petitioners’ claim is not the kind\nof substantive interest, accordingly, on which a uniform,\njudicially enforced national standard is presumptively\nappropriate.36\n   Indeed, in some respects the substantive right at issue\nmay be better viewed as a property right. Petitioners wish\nto acquire certain types of firearms, or to keep certain\nfirearms they have previously acquired. Interests in the\npossession of chattels have traditionally been viewed as\nproperty interests subject to definition and regulation by\nthe States. Cf.

Ante, at 9. That is\nwhat the Second Amendment protects against Federal Government\ninfringement. I have taken pains to show why the Fourteenth Amend­\nment liberty interest asserted by petitioners—the interest in keeping a\nfirearm of one’s choosing in the home—is not necessarily coextensive\nwith the Second Amendment right.\n\f                      Cite as: 561 U.

But those implica­\ntions are generally quite attenuated. A defendant’s invo­\ncation of his right to remain silent, to confront a witness,\nor to exclude certain evidence cannot directly cause any\nthreat. The defendant’s liberty interest is constrained by\n(and is itself a constraint on) the adjudicatory process.\nThe link between handgun ownership and public safety is\nmuch tighter. The handgun is itself a tool for crime; the\nhandgun’s bullets are the violence.\n   Similarly, it is undeniable that some may take profound\noffense at a remark made by the soapbox speaker, the\npractices of another religion, or a gay couple’s choice to\nhave intimate relations.

If a legislature’s response to dangerous\nweapons ends up impinging upon the liberty of any indi­\nviduals in pursuit of the greater good, it invariably does so\non the basis of more than the majority’s “ ‘own moral\ncode,’ ” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 571 (quoting Casey, 505\nU. S., at 850). While specific policies may of course be\nmisguided, gun control is an area in which it “is quite\nwrong . . . to assume that regulation and liberty occupy\nmutually exclusive zones—that as one expands, the other\nmust contract.” Stevens, 41 U. Miami L. Rev., at 280.\n   Third, the experience of other advanced democracies,\nincluding those that share our British heritage, undercuts\nthe notion that an expansive right to keep and bear arms\nis intrinsic to ordered liberty. Many of these countries\nplace restrictions on the possession, use, and carriage of\nfirearms far more onerous than the restrictions found in\nthis Nation. See Municipal Respondents’ Brief 21–23\n(discussing laws of England, Canada, Australia, Japan,\nDenmark, Finland, Luxembourg, and New Zealand). That\nthe United States is an international outlier in the per­\nmissiveness of its approach to guns does not suggest that\nour laws are bad laws. It does suggest that this Court\nmay not need to assume responsibility for making our\nlaws still more permissive.\n   Admittedly, these other countries differ from ours in\nmany relevant respects, including their problems with\nviolent crime and the traditional role that firearms have\nplayed in their societies.

Generally, the\ninclusion of a liberty interest in the Bill of Rights points\ntoward the conclusion that it is of fundamental significance\nand ought to be enforceable against the States.

Cf. post, at 16–17. The city of Chicago, for\nexample, faces a pressing challenge in combating criminal\nstreet gangs. Most rural areas do not.

Few issues of public policy are\nsubject to such intensive and rapidly developing empirical\ncontroversy as gun control. See Heller, 554 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 20–25) (BREYER, J., dissenting). Chicago’s\nhandgun ban, in itself, has divided researchers. Compare\nBrief for Professors of Criminal Justice as Amici Curiae\n(arguing that ordinance has been effective at reducing gun\nviolence), with Brief for International Law Enforcement\nEducators and Trainers Association et al. as Amici Curiae\n17–26 (arguing that ordinance has been a failure).46 Of\ncourse, on some matters the Constitution requires that we\nignore such pragmatic considerations. But the Constitu­\ntion’s text, history, and structure are not so clear on the\nmatter before us—as evidenced by the groundbreaking\nnature of today’s fractured decision—and this Court lacks\nboth the technical capacity and the localized expertise to\nassess “the wisdom, need, and propriety” of most gun­\ncontrol measures. Griswold, 381 U. S., at 482.47\n——————\n  46 The fact that Chicago’s handgun murder rate may have “actually\n\nincreased since the ban was enacted,” ante, at 2 (majority opinion),\nmeans virtually nothing in itself. Countless factors unrelated to the\npolicy may have contributed to that trend. Without a sophisticated\nregression analysis, we cannot even begin to speculate as to the efficacy\nor effects of the handgun ban. Even with such an analysis, we could\nnever be certain as to the determinants of the city’s murder rate.\n  47 In some sense, it is no doubt true that the “best” solution is elusive\n\nfor many “serious social problems.” Ante, at 12 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).\nYet few social problems have raised such heated empirical controversy\nas the problem of gun violence. And few, if any, of the liberty interests\nwe have recognized under the Due Process Clause have raised as many\ncomplications for judicial oversight as the interest that is recognized\ntoday.

Quite to the con­\ntrary, today’s decision invites an avalanche of litigation\nthat could mire the federal courts in fine-grained determi­\nnations about which state and local regulations comport\nwith the Heller right—the precise contours of which are\nfar from pellucid—under a standard of review we have not\neven established. See post, at 12–15. The plurality’s\n“assuranc[e]” that “incorporation does not imperil every\nlaw regulating firearms,” ante, at 40, provides only modest\ncomfort. For it is also an admission of just how many\ndifferent types of regulations are potentially implicated by\ntoday’s ruling, and of just how ad hoc the Court’s initial\nattempt to draw distinctions among them was in Heller.\nThe practical significance of the proposition that “the\nSecond Amendment right is fully applicable to the States,”\nante, at 1 (majority opinion), remains to be worked out by\nthis Court over many, many years.\n  Furthermore, and critically, the Court’s imposition of a\nnational standard is still more unwise because the elected\nbranches have shown themselves to be perfectly capable of\nsafeguarding the interest in keeping and bearing arms.\nThe strength of a liberty claim must be assessed in con­\nnection with its status in the democratic process. And in\nthis case, no one disputes “that opponents of [gun] control\nhave considerable political power and do not seem to be at\na systematic disadvantage in the democratic process,” or\nthat “the widespread commitment to an individual right to\nown guns . . . operates as a safeguard against excessive or\n\n——————\npluralistic society, there will almost never be such uniformity of opin­\nion. But to the extent that popular consensus is relevant, I do not agree\nwith the Court that the amicus brief filed in this case by numerous\nstate attorneys general constitutes evidence thereof. Ante, at 42–43. It\nis puzzling that so many state lawmakers have asked us to limit their\noption to regulate a dangerous item. Cf. post, at 9–10.\n\f50                    MCDONALD v.

Indeed, there is a good deal of\nevidence to suggest that, if anything, American lawmakers\ntend to underregulate guns, relative to the policy views\nexpressed by majorities in opinion polls. See K. Goss,\nDisarmed: The Missing Movement for Gun Control in\nAmerica 6 (2006). If a particular State or locality has\nenacted some “improvident” gun-control measures, as\npetitioners believe Chicago has done, there is no apparent\nreason to infer that the mistake will not “eventually be\nrectified by the democratic process.” Vance v.

Having failed to show why their\nasserted interest is intrinsic to the concept of ordered\nliberty or vulnerable to maltreatment in the political\narena, they have failed to show why “the word liberty in\nthe Fourteenth Amendment” should be “held to prevent\nthe natural outcome of a dominant opinion” about how to\n\n——————\n  48 Likewise, no one contends that those interested in personal self­\ndefense—every American, presumably—face any particular disadvan­\ntage in the political process.

Colorful as it is, JUSTICE SCALIA’s\ncritique does not have nearly as much force as does his\nrhetoric. His theory of substantive due process, moreover,\ncomes with its own profound difficulties.\n  Although JUSTICE SCALIA aspires to an “objective,”\n“neutral” method of substantive due process analysis,\nante, at 10, his actual method is nothing of the sort. Un­\nder the “historically focused” approach he advocates, ante,\nat 13, numerous threshold questions arise before one ever\ngets to the history. At what level of generality should one\nframe the liberty interest in question? See n. 25, supra.\nWhat does it mean for a right to be “ ‘deeply rooted in this\nNation’s history and tradition,’ ” ante, at 3 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721)? By what standard will\nthat proposition be tested? Which types of sources will\ncount, and how will those sources be weighed and aggre­\ngated? There is no objective, neutral answer to these\nquestions. There is not even a theory—at least, JUSTICE\nSCALIA provides none—of how to go about answering\nthem.\n  Nor is there any escaping Palko, it seems. To qualify for\nsubstantive due process protection, JUSTICE SCALIA has\nstated, an asserted liberty right must be not only deeply\n\f52                     MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                         STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nrooted in American tradition, “but it must also be implicit\nin the concept of ordered liberty.” Lawrence, 539 U. S., at\n593, n. 3 (dissenting opinion) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Applying the latter, Palko-derived half of that\ntest requires precisely the sort of reasoned judgment—the\nsame multifaceted evaluation of the right’s contours and\nconsequences—that JUSTICE SCALIA mocks in his concur­\nrence today.\n   So does applying the first half. It is hardly a novel\ninsight that history is not an objective science, and that its\nuse can therefore “point in any direction the judges favor,”\nante, at 14 (opinion of SCALIA, J.). Yet 21 years after the\npoint was brought to his attention by Justice Brennan,\nJUSTICE SCALIA remains “oblivious to the fact that [the\nconcept of ‘tradition’] can be as malleable and elusive as\n‘liberty’ itself.” Michael H., 491 U. S., at 137 (dissenting\nopinion). Even when historical analysis is focused on a\ndiscrete proposition, such as the original public meaning of\nthe Second Amendment, the evidence often points in\ndifferent directions. The historian must choose which\npieces to credit and which to discount, and then must try\nto assemble them into a coherent whole. In Heller,\nJUSTICE SCALIA preferred to rely on sources created much\nearlier and later in time than the Second Amendment\nitself, see, e.g., 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4–5) (consult­\ning late 19th-century treatises to ascertain how Americans\nwould have read the Amendment’s preamble in 1791); I\nfocused more closely on sources contemporaneous with the\nAmendment’s drafting and ratification.49 No mechanical\n——————\n  49 See Heller, 554 U.

At least with the former sort\nof question, the judge can focus on a single legal provision;\nthe temporal scope of the inquiry is (or should be) rela­\ntively bounded; and there is substantial agreement on\nwhat sorts of authorities merit consideration.

What if the evidence had shown that, whereas at\none time firearm possession contributed substantially to\npersonal liberty and safety, nowadays it contributes noth­\ning, or even tends to undermine them? Would it still have\nbeen reasonable to constitutionalize the right?\n   The concern runs still deeper. Not only can historical\nviews be less than completely clear or informative, but\nthey can also be wrong. Some notions that many Ameri­\ncans deeply believed to be true, at one time, turned out not\nto be true. Some practices that many Americans believed\nto be consistent with the Constitution’s guarantees of\nliberty and equality, at one time, turned out to be incon­\nsistent with them. The fact that we have a written Con­\nstitution does not consign this Nation to a static legal\nexistence. Although we should always “pa[y] a decent\nregard to the opinions of former times,” it “is not the glory\nof the people of America” to have “suffered a blind venera­\ntion for antiquity.” The Federalist No. 14, p. 99, 104 (C.\nRossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison). It is not the role of federal\njudges to be amateur historians. And it is not fidelity to\nthe Constitution to ignore its use of deliberately capacious\nlanguage, in an effort to transform foundational legal\ncommitments into narrow rules of decision.\n   As for “the democratic process,” ante, at 14, 15, a\nmethod that looks exclusively to history can easily do more\nharm than good. Just consider this case. The net result of\nJUSTICE SCALIA’s supposedly objective analysis is to vest\n\f56                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nfederal judges—ultimately a majority of the judges on this\nCourt—with unprecedented lawmaking powers in an area\nin which they have no special qualifications, and in which\nthe give-and-take of the political process has functioned\neffectively for decades. Why this “intrudes much less upon\nthe democratic process,” ante, at 14, than an approach\nthat would defer to the democratic process on the regula­\ntion of firearms is, to say the least, not self-evident. I\ncannot even tell what, under JUSTICE SCALIA’s view, con­\nstitutes an “intrusion.”\n   It is worth pondering, furthermore, the vision of democ­\nracy that underlies JUSTICE SCALIA’s critique. Because\nvery few of us would welcome a system in which majorities\nor powerful interest groups always get their way. Under\nour constitutional scheme, I would have thought that a\njudicial approach to liberty claims such as the one I have\noutlined—an approach that investigates both the intrinsic\nnature of the claimed interest and the practical signifi­\ncance of its judicial enforcement, that is transparent in its\nreasoning and sincere in its effort to incorporate con­\nstraints, that is guided by history but not beholden to it,\nand that is willing to protect some rights even if they have\nnot already received uniform protection from the elected\nbranches—has the capacity to improve, rather than\n“[im]peril,” ante, at 15, our democracy. It all depends on\njudges’ exercising careful, reasoned judgment. As it al­\nways has, and as it always will.\n                             VII\n  The fact that the right to keep and bear arms appears in\nthe Constitution should not obscure the novelty of the\nCourt’s decision to enforce that right against the States.\nBy its terms, the Second Amendment does not apply to the\nStates; read properly, it does not even apply to individuals\noutside of the militia context. The Second Amendment\nwas adopted to protect the States from federal encroach­\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           57\n\n                    STEVENS, J., dissenting\n\nment. And the Fourteenth Amendment has never been\nunderstood by the Court to have “incorporated” the entire\nBill of Rights. There was nothing foreordained about\ntoday’s outcome.\n   Although the Court’s decision in this case might be seen\nas a mere adjunct to its decision in Heller, the conse­\nquences could prove far more destructive—quite liter­\nally—to our Nation’s communities and to our constitu­\ntional structure. Thankfully, the Second Amendment\nright identified in Heller and its newly minted Fourteenth\nAmendment analogue are limited, at least for now, to the\nhome. But neither the “assurances” provided by the plu­\nrality, ante, at 40, nor the many historical sources cited in\nits opinion should obscure the reality that today’s ruling\nmarks a dramatic change in our law—or that the Justices\nwho have joined it have brought to bear an awesome\namount of discretion in resolving the legal question pre­\nsented by this case.\n   I would proceed more cautiously. For the reasons set\nout at length above, I cannot accept either the methodol­\nogy the Court employs or the conclusions it draws. Al­\nthough impressively argued, the majority’s decision to\noverturn more than a century of Supreme Court precedent\nand to unsettle a much longer tradition of state practice is\nnot, in my judgment, built “upon respect for the teachings\nof history, solid recognition of the basic values that under­\nlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles\nthat the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers\nhave played in establishing and preserving American\nfreedoms.” Griswold, 381 U. S., at 501 (Harlan, J., con­\ncurring in judgment).\n   Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

As he\nargues, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment\nwith this objective in view. See ante, at 41–44 (dissenting\nopinion). Unlike other forms of substantive liberty, the\ncarrying of arms for that purpose often puts others’ lives\nat risk. See ante, at 35–37. And the use of arms for pri\nvate self-defense does not warrant federal constitutional\nprotection from state regulation. See ante, at 44–51.\n  The Court, however, does not expressly rest its opinion\nupon “substantive due process” concerns. Rather, it di\nrects its attention to this Court’s “incorporation” prece\ndents and asks whether the Second Amendment right to\nprivate self-defense is “fundamental” so that it applies to\nthe States through the Fourteenth Amendment. See ante,\nat 11–19.\n  I shall therefore separately consider the question of\n“incorporation.” I can find nothing in the Second Amend\nment’s text, history, or underlying rationale that could\nwarrant characterizing it as “fundamental” insofar as it\nseeks to protect the keeping and bearing of arms for pri\n\f2                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nvate self-defense purposes. Nor can I find any justification\nfor interpreting the Constitution as transferring ultimate\nregulatory authority over the private uses of firearms from\ndemocratically elected legislatures to courts or from the\nStates to the Federal Government. I therefore conclude\nthat the Fourteenth Amendment does not “incorporate”\nthe Second Amendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms.”\nAnd I consequently dissent.\n                               I\n    The Second Amendment says: “A well regulated Militia,\nbeing necessary to the security of a free State, the right of\nthe people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”\nTwo years ago, in District of Columbia v.

Although the Court acknowledged that\n“the threat that the new Federal Government would de\nstroy the citizens’ militia by taking away their arms was\nthe reason that right . . . was codified in a written Consti\ntution,” the Court asserted that “individual self defense\n. . . was the central component of the right itself.” Heller,\nsupra, at ___ (slip op., at 26) (first emphasis added). The\nCourt went on to hold that the Second Amendment re\nstricted Congress’ power to regulate handguns used for\nself-defense, and the Court found unconstitutional the\nDistrict of Columbia’s ban on the possession of handguns\nin the home. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 64).\n    The Court based its conclusions almost exclusively upon\nits reading of history. But the relevant history in Heller\nwas far from clear: Four dissenting Justices disagreed\nwith the majority’s historical analysis.

Rev. 171 (2008).\n   Consider as an example of these critiques an amici brief\nfiled in this case by historians who specialize in the study\nof the English Civil Wars. They tell us that Heller misun\nderstood a key historical point. See Brief for Eng\nlish/Early American Historians as Amici Curiae (hereinaf\nter English Historians’ Brief) (filed by 21 professors at\nleading universities in the United States, United King\ndom, and Australia). Heller’s conclusion that “individual\nself-defense” was “the central component” of the Second\nAmendment’s right “to keep and bear Arms” rested upon\nits view that the Amendment “codified a pre-existing right”\nthat had “nothing whatever to do with service in a mili\n\f4                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntia.” 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26, 19–20). That view in\nturn rested in significant part upon Blackstone having\ndescribed the right as “ ‘the right of having and using arms\nfor self-preservation and defence,’ ” which reflected the\nprovision in the English Declaration of Right of 1689 that\ngave the King’s Protestant “ ‘subjects’ ” the right to “ ‘have\nArms for their defence suitable to their Conditions, and as\nallowed by law.’ ” Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19–20) (quoting 1\nW. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 140\n(1765) (hereinafter Blackstone) and 1 W. & M., c. 2, §7, in\n3 Eng. Stat. at Large 441 (1689)). The Framers, said the\nmajority, understood that right “as permitting a citizen to\n‘repe[l] force by force’ when ‘the intervention of society in\nhis behalf, may be too late to prevent an injury.’ ” 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 21) (quoting St. George Tucker, 1\nBlackstone’s Commentaries 145–146, n. 42 (1803)).\n   The historians now tell us, however, that the right to\nwhich Blackstone referred had, not nothing, but every\nthing, to do with the militia. As properly understood at\nthe time of the English Civil Wars, the historians claim,\nthe right to bear arms “ensured that Parliament had the\npower” to arm the citizenry: “to defend the realm” in the\ncase of a foreign enemy, and to “secure the right of ‘self\npreservation,’ ” or “self-defense,” should “the sovereign\nusurp the English Constitution.” English Historians’ Brief\n3, 8–13, 23–24 (emphasis added). Thus, the Declaration of\nRight says that private persons can possess guns only “as\nallowed by law.” See id., at 20–24. Moreover, when\nBlackstone referred to “ ‘the right of having and using\narms for self-preservation and defence,’ ” he was referring\nto the right of the people “to take part in the militia to\ndefend their political liberties,” and to the right of Parlia\nment (which represented the people) to raise a militia even\nwhen the King sought to deny it that power. Id., at 4, 24–\n27 (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Blackstone 140). Nor can\nthe historians find any convincing reason to believe that\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Compare Heller, supra, at ___\n(slip op., at 21–22) with English Historians’ Brief 28–40.\nThe historians concede that at least one historian takes a\ndifferent position, see id., at 7, but the Court, they imply,\nwould lose a poll taken among professional historians of\nthis period, say, by a vote of 8 to 1.\n   If history, and history alone, is what matters, why\nwould the Court not now reconsider Heller in light of these\nmore recently published historical views?

At the least, where\nHeller’s historical foundations are so uncertain, why ex\ntend its applicability?\n   My aim in referring to this history is to illustrate the\nreefs and shoals that lie in wait for those nonexpert judges\nwho place virtually determinative weight upon historical\nconsiderations. In my own view, the Court should not look\nto history alone but to other factors as well—above all, in\ncases where the history is so unclear that the experts\nthemselves strongly disagree. It should, for example,\nconsider the basic values that underlie a constitutional\nprovision and their contemporary significance. And it\nshould examine as well the relevant consequences and\npractical justifications that might, or might not, warrant\nremoving an important question from the democratic\ndecisionmaking process. See ante, at 16–20 (STEVENS, J.,\ndissenting) (discussing shortcomings of an exclusively\n\f6                 MCDONALD v.

Under this Court’s precedents, to incorporate the\nprivate self-defense right the majority must show that the\nright is, e.g., “fundamental to the American scheme of\njustice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107685\"><a href=\"/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149 (1968);\nsee ibid., n. 14; see also ante, at 44 (plurality opinion)\n(finding that the right is “fundamental” and therefore\nincorporated). And this it fails to do.\n   The majority here, like that in Heller, relies almost\nexclusively upon history to make the necessary showing.\nAnte, at 20–33. But to do so for incorporation purposes is\nboth wrong and dangerous. As JUSTICE STEVENS points\nout, our society has historically made mistakes—for ex\nample, when considering certain 18th- and 19th-century\nproperty rights to be fundamental. Ante, at 19 (dissenting\nopinion). And in the incorporation context, as elsewhere,\nhistory often is unclear about the answers. See Part I,\nsupra; Part III, infra.\n   Accordingly, this Court, in considering an incorporation\nquestion, has never stated that the historical status of a\nright is the only relevant consideration. Rather, the Court\nhas either explicitly or implicitly made clear in its opin\nions that the right in question has remained fundamental\nover time. See, e.g., Apodaca v. Oregon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108539\"><a href=\"/opinion/108539/apodaca-v-oregon/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410\n(1972) (plurality opinion) (stating that the incorporation\n“inquiry must focus upon the function served” by the right\nin question in “contemporary society” (emphasis added));\nDuncan v.

And, indeed, neither of the parties before\nus in this case has asked us to employ the majority’s his\ntory-constrained approach. See Brief for Petitioners 67–69\n(arguing for incorporation based on trends in contempo\nrary support for the right); Brief for Respondents City of\nChicago et al. 23–31 (hereinafter Municipal Respondents)\n(looking to current state practices with respect to the\nright).\n   I thus think it proper, above all where history provides\nno clear answer, to look to other factors in considering\nwhether a right is sufficiently “fundamental” to remove it\nfrom the political process in every State. I would include\namong those factors the nature of the right; any contem\nporary disagreement about whether the right is funda\nmental; the extent to which incorporation will further\nother, perhaps more basic, constitutional aims; and the\nextent to which incorporation will advance or hinder the\nConstitution’s structural aims, including its division of\npowers among different governmental institutions (and\nthe people as well). Is incorporation needed, for example,\nto further the Constitution’s effort to ensure that the\ngovernment treats each individual with equal respect?\nWill it help maintain the democratic form of government\nthat the Constitution foresees? In a word, will incorpora\ntion prove consistent, or inconsistent, with the Constitu\ntion’s efforts to create governmental institutions well\nsuited to the carrying out of its constitutional promises?\n   Finally, I would take account of the Framers’ basic\nreason for believing the Court ought to have the power of\njudicial review. Alexander Hamilton feared granting that\npower to Congress alone, for he feared that Congress,\nacting as judges, would not overturn as unconstitutional a\npopular statute that it had recently enacted, as legislators.\nThe Federalist No. 78, p. 405 (G. Carey & J. McClellan\neds. 2001) (A. Hamilton) (“This independence of the judges\nis equally requisite to guard the constitution and the\n\f8                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrights of individuals from the effects of those ill humours,\nwhich” can, at times, lead to “serious oppressions of the\nminor part in the community”). Judges, he thought, may\nfind it easier to resist popular pressure to suppress the\nbasic rights of an unpopular minority. See United States\nv. Carolene Products Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103017\"><a href=\"/opinion/103017/united-states-v-carolene-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152, n. 4 (1938).\nThat being so, it makes sense to ask whether that particu\nlar comparative judicial advantage is relevant to the case\nat hand. See, e.g., J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust (1980).\n                               B\n   How do these considerations apply here? For one thing,\nI would apply them only to the private self-defense right\ndirectly at issue. After all, the Amendment’s militia\nrelated purpose is primarily to protect States from federal\nregulation, not to protect individuals from militia-related\nregulation. Heller, 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26); see\nalso Miller, 307 U. S., at 178. Moreover, the Civil War\nAmendments, the electoral process, the courts, and nu\nmerous other institutions today help to safeguard the\nStates and the people from any serious threat of federal\ntyranny. How are state militias additionally necessary?\nIt is difficult to see how a right that, as the majority con\ncedes, has “largely faded as a popular concern” could\npossibly be so fundamental that it would warrant incorpo\nration through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ante, at 22.\nHence, the incorporation of the Second Amendment cannot\nbe based on the militia-related aspect of what Heller found\nto be more extensive Second Amendment rights.\n   For another thing, as Heller concedes, the private self\ndefense right that the Court would incorporate has noth\ning to do with “the reason” the Framers “codified” the right\nto keep and bear arms “in a written Constitution.” 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 26) (emphasis added). Heller\nimmediately adds that the self-defense right was nonethe\nless “the central component of the right.” Ibid.

See Part I, supra. But, taking it as valid, the\nFramers’ basic reasons for including language in the Con\nstitution would nonetheless seem more pertinent (in decid\ning about the contemporary importance of a right) than\nthe particular scope 17th- or 18th-century listeners would\nhave then assigned to the words they used. And examina\ntion of the Framers’ motivation tells us they did not think\nthe private armed self-defense right was of paramount\nimportance. See Amar, The Bill of Rights as a Constitu\ntion, 100 Yale L. J. 1131, 1164 (1991) (“[T]o see the [Sec\nond] Amendment as primarily concerned with an individ\nual right to hunt, or protect one’s home,” would be “like\nviewing the heart of the speech and assembly clauses as\nthe right of persons to meet to play bridge”); see also, e.g.,\nRakove, The Second Amendment: The Highest Stage of\nOriginalism, 76 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 103, 127–128 (2000);\nBrief for Historians on Early American Legal, Constitu\ntional, and Pennsylvania History as Amici Curiae 22–33.\n   Further, there is no popular consensus that the private\nself-defense right described in Heller is fundamental. The\nplurality suggests that two amici briefs filed in the case\nshow such a consensus, see ante, at 42–43, but, of course,\nnumerous amici briefs have been filed opposing incorpora\ntion as well. Moreover, every State regulates firearms\nextensively, and public opinion is sharply divided on the\nappropriate level of regulation. Much of this disagreement\nrests upon empirical considerations. One side believes the\nright essential to protect the lives of those attacked in the\nhome; the other side believes it essential to regulate the\nright in order to protect the lives of others attacked with\nguns. It seems unlikely that definitive evidence will de\nvelop one way or the other. And the appropriate level of\nfirearm regulation has thus long been, and continues to\nbe, a hotly contested matter of political debate.

Nor will\nincorporation help to assure equal respect for individuals.\nUnlike the First Amendment’s rights of free speech, free\npress, assembly, and petition, the private self-defense\nright does not comprise a necessary part of the democratic\nprocess that the Constitution seeks to establish.

Unlike the First Amendment’s religious\nprotections, the Fourth Amendment’s protection against\nunreasonable searches and seizures, the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments’ insistence upon fair criminal procedure, and\nthe Eighth Amendment’s protection against cruel and\nunusual punishments, the private self-defense right does\nnot significantly seek to protect individuals who might\notherwise suffer unfair or inhumane treatment at the\nhands of a majority. Unlike the protections offered by\nmany of these same Amendments, it does not involve\nmatters as to which judges possess a comparative exper\ntise, by virtue of their close familiarity with the justice\nsystem and its operation. And, unlike the Fifth Amend\nment’s insistence on just compensation, it does not involve\na matter where a majority might unfairly seize for itself\nproperty belonging to a minority.\n   Finally, incorporation of the right will work a significant\ndisruption in the constitutional allocation of decisionmak\ning authority, thereby interfering with the Constitution’s\nability to further its objectives.\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U.

Private gun\nregulation is the quintessential exercise of a State’s “police\npower”—i.e., the power to “protec[t] . . . the lives, limbs,\nhealth, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and the protec\ntion of all property within the State,” by enacting “all\nkinds of restraints and burdens” on both “persons and\nproperty.” Slaughter-House Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"88661\"><a href=\"/opinion/88661/slaughter-house-cases/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1873)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).

But\nhere, this inquiry—calling for the fine tuning of protective\nrules—is likely to be part of a daily judicial diet.\n   Given the competing interests, courts will have to try to\nanswer empirical questions of a particularly difficult kind.\nSuppose, for example, that after a gun regulation’s adop\ntion the murder rate went up. Without the gun regulation\nwould the murder rate have risen even faster? How is this\nconclusion affected by the local recession which has left\nnumerous people unemployed?

J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10).\n   The difficulty of finding answers to these questions is\nexceeded only by the importance of doing so. Firearms\ncause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United\nStates each year. Those who live in urban areas, police\nofficers, women, and children, all may be particularly at\nrisk. And gun regulation may save their lives. Some\nexperts have calculated, for example, that Chicago’s hand\ngun ban has saved several hundred lives, perhaps close to\n1,000, since it was enacted in 1983. Other experts argue\nthat stringent gun regulations “can help protect police\nofficers operating on the front lines against gun violence,”\nhave reduced homicide rates in Washington, D. C., and\nBaltimore, and have helped to lower New York’s crime and\nhomicide rates.\n   At the same time, the opponents of regulation cast doubt\non these studies. And who is right? Finding out may\nrequire interpreting studies that are only indirectly re\nlated to a particular regulatory statute, say one banning\nhandguns in the home. Suppose studies find more acci\ndents and suicides where there is a handgun in the home\n\f14                 MCDONALD v.

What if\nopponents of the ban put forth counter studies?\n   In answering such questions judges cannot simply refer\nto judicial homilies, such as Blackstone’s 18th-century\nperception that a man’s home is his castle. See 4 Black\nstone 223. Nor can the plurality so simply reject, by mere\nassertion, the fact that “incorporation will require judges\nto assess the costs and benefits of firearms restrictions.”\nAnte, at 44. How can the Court assess the strength of the\ngovernment’s regulatory interests without addressing\nissues of empirical fact? How can the Court determine if a\nregulation is appropriately tailored without considering its\nimpact? And how can the Court determine if there are\nless restrictive alternatives without considering what will\nhappen if those alternatives are implemented?\n   Perhaps the Court could lessen the difficulty of the\nmission it has created for itself by adopting a jurispruden\ntial approach similar to the many state courts that admin\nister a state constitutional right to bear arms. See infra,\nat 19–20 (describing state approaches). But the Court has\nnot yet done so. Cf. Heller, 544 U.

Rather, the Court has haphazardly created a few\nsimple rules, such as that it will not touch “prohibitions on\nthe possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill,”\n“laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive\nplaces such as schools and government buildings,” or “laws\nimposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial\nsale of arms.” Heller, 544 U.

There\n     must be power in the States and the Nation to re\n     mould, through experimentation, our economic prac\n     tices and institutions to meet changing social and eco\n     nomic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the\n     Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified\n     it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct [the\n     social problems we face].”\n  There are 50 state legislatures. The fact that this Court\nmay already have refused to take this wise advice with\nrespect to Congress in Heller is no reason to make matters\nworse here.\n  Third, the ability of States to reflect local preferences\nand conditions—both key virtues of federalism—here has\nparticular importance. The incidence of gun ownership\nvaries substantially as between crowded cities and uncon\ngested rural communities, as well as among the different\ngeographic regions of the country. Thus, approximately\n60% of adults who live in the relatively sparsely populated\nWestern States of Alaska, Montana, and Wyoming report\nthat their household keeps a gun, while fewer than 15% of\nadults in the densely populated Eastern States of Rhode\nIsland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts say the same.\n  The nature of gun violence also varies as between rural\ncommunities and cities. Urban centers face significantly\ngreater levels of firearm crime and homicide, while rural\ncommunities have proportionately greater problems with\nnonhomicide gun deaths, such as suicides and accidents.\nAnd idiosyncratic local factors can lead to two cities find\ning themselves in dramatically different circumstances:\nFor example, in 2008, the murder rate was 40 times\nhigher in New Orleans than it was in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)          17\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   It is thus unsurprising that States and local communi\nties have historically differed about the need for gun regu\nlation as well as about its proper level. Nor is it surpris\ning that “primarily, and historically,” the law has treated\nthe exercise of police powers, including gun control, as\n“matter[s] of local concern.” Medtronic, 518 U. S., at 475\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n   Fourth, although incorporation of any right removes\ndecisions from the democratic process, the incorporation of\nthis particular right does so without strong offsetting\njustification—as the example of Oak Park’s handgun ban\nhelps to show. See Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §27–2–\n1 (1995). Oak Park decided to ban handguns in 1983,\nafter a local attorney was shot to death with a handgun\nthat his assailant had smuggled into a courtroom in a\nblanket. Brief for Oak Park Citizens Committee for\nHandgun Control as Amicus Curiae 1, 21 (hereinafter Oak\nPark Brief). A citizens committee spent months gathering\ninformation about handguns. Id., at 21. It secured 6,000\nsignatures from community residents in support of a ban.\nId., at 21–22. And the village board enacted a ban into\nlaw. Id., at 22.\n   Subsequently, at the urging of ban opponents the Board\nheld a community referendum on the matter. Ibid. The\ncitizens committee argued strongly in favor of the ban.\nId., at 22–23. It pointed out that most guns owned in Oak\nPark were handguns and that handguns were misused\nmore often than citizens used them in self-defense. Id., at\n23. The ban opponents argued just as strongly to the\ncontrary. Ibid. The public decided to keep the ban by a\nvote of 8,031 to 6,368. Ibid. And since that time, Oak\nPark now tells us, crime has decreased and the community\nhas seen no accidental handgun deaths. Id., at 2.\n   Given the empirical and local value-laden nature of the\nquestions that lie at the heart of the issue, why, in a Na\ntion whose Constitution foresees democratic decisionmak\n\f18                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ning, is it so fundamental a matter as to require taking that\npower from the people? What is it here that the people did\nnot know? What is it that a judge knows better?\n                        *     *    *\n  In sum, the police power, the superiority of legislative\ndecisionmaking, the need for local decisionmaking, the\ncomparative desirability of democratic decisionmaking,\nthe lack of a manageable judicial standard, and the life\nthreatening harm that may flow from striking down regu\nlations all argue against incorporation. Where the incor\nporation of other rights has been at issue, some of these\nproblems have arisen. But in this instance all these prob\nlems are present, all at the same time, and all are likely to\nbe present in most, perhaps nearly all, of the cases in\nwhich the constitutionality of a gun regulation is at issue.\nAt the same time, the important factors that favor incor\nporation in other instances—e.g., the protection of broader\nconstitutional objectives—are not present here. The up\nshot is that all factors militate against incorporation—\nwith the possible exception of historical factors.\n                             III\n  I must, then, return to history. The plurality, in seeking\nto justify incorporation, asks whether the interests the\nSecond Amendment protects are “ ‘deeply rooted in this\nNation’s history and tradition.’ ” Ante, at 19 (quoting\nGlucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; internal quotation marks\nomitted). It looks to selected portions of the Nation’s\nhistory for the answer. And it finds an affirmative reply.\n  As I have made clear, I do not believe history is the only\npertinent consideration. Nor would I read history as\nbroadly as the majority does. In particular, since we here\nare evaluating a more particular right—namely, the right\nto bear arms for purposes of private self-defense—general\nhistorical references to the “right to keep and bear arms”\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           19\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nare not always helpful. Depending upon context, early\nhistorical sources may mean to refer to a militia-based\nright—a matter of considerable importance 200 years\nago—which has, as the majority points out, “largely faded\nas a popular concern.” Ante, at 22. There is no reason to\nbelieve that matters of such little contemporary impor\ntance should play a significant role in answering the\nincorporation question. See Apodaca, 406 U. S., at 410\n(incorporation “inquiry must focus upon the function\nserved” by the right in question in “contemporary soci\nety”); Wolf v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104709\"><a href=\"/opinion/104709/wolf-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1949) (incorpora\ntion must take into account “the movements of a free\nsociety” and “the gradual and empiric process of inclusion\nand exclusion” (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf.\nU. S. Const., Art. I, §910 (prohibiting federal officeholders\nfrom accepting a “Title, of any kind whatever, from [a]\nforeign State”—presumably a matter of considerable\nimportance 200 years ago).\n   That said, I can find much in the historical record that\nshows that some Americans in some places at certain\ntimes thought it important to keep and bear arms for\nprivate self-defense. For instance, the reader will see that\nmany States have constitutional provisions protecting gun\npossession. But, as far as I can tell, those provisions\ntypically do no more than guarantee that a gun regulation\nwill be a reasonable police power regulation. See Winkler,\nScrutinizing the Second Amendment, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev.\n683, 686, 716–717 (2007) (the “courts of every state to\nconsider the question apply a deferential ‘reasonable\nregulation’ standard”) (hereinafter Winkler, Scrutinizing);\nsee also id., at 716–717 (explaining the difference between\nthat standard and ordinary rational-basis review). It is\nthus altogether unclear whether such provisions would\nprohibit cities such as Chicago from enacting laws, such as\nthe law before us, banning handguns. See id., at 723. The\nmajority, however, would incorporate a right that is likely\n\f20                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninconsistent with Chicago’s law; and the majority would\nalmost certainly strike down that law. Cf. Heller, 554\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64) (striking down the District\nof Columbia’s handgun ban).\n   Thus, the specific question before us is not whether\nthere are references to the right to bear arms for self\ndefense throughout this Nation’s history—of course there\nare—or even whether the Court should incorporate a\nsimple constitutional requirement that firearms regula\ntions not unreasonably burden the right to keep and bear\narms, but rather whether there is a consensus that so\nsubstantial a private self-defense right as the one de\nscribed in Heller applies to the States. See, e.g., Glucks\nberg, supra, at 721 (requiring “a careful description” of the\nright at issue when deciding whether it is “deeply rooted\nin this Nation’s history and tradition” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)). On this question, the reader will have to\nmake up his or her own mind about the historical record\nthat I describe in part below. In my view, that record is\ninsufficient to say that the right to bear arms for private\nself-defense, as explicated by Heller, is fundamental in the\nsense relevant to the incorporation inquiry. As the evi\ndence below shows, States and localities have consistently\nenacted firearms regulations, including regulations simi\nlar to those at issue here, throughout our Nation’s history.\nCourts have repeatedly upheld such regulations. And it is,\nat the very least, possible, and perhaps likely, that incor\nporation will impose on every, or nearly every, State a\ndifferent right to bear arms than they currently recog\nnize—a right that threatens to destabilize settled state\nlegal principles. Cf. 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 57–64)\n(rejecting an “ ‘interest-balancing’ approach” similar to\nthat employed by the States).\n   I thus cannot find a historical consensus with respect to\nwhether the right described by Heller is “fundamental” as\nour incorporation cases use that term. Nor can I find\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)            21\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nsufficient historical support for the majority’s conclusion\nthat that right is “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history\nand tradition.” Instead, I find no more than ambiguity\nand uncertainty that perhaps even expert historians\nwould find difficult to penetrate. And a historical record\nthat is so ambiguous cannot itself provide an adequate\nbasis for incorporating a private right of self-defense and\napplying it against the States.\nThe Eighteenth Century\n   The opinions in Heller collect much of the relevant 18th\ncentury evidence. See 554 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5–32);\nid., at ___ (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5–31); id.,\nat ___ (BREYER, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4–7). In respect\nto the relevant question—the “deeply rooted nature” of a\nright to keep and bear arms for purposes of private self\ndefense—that evidence is inconclusive, particularly when\naugmented as follows:\n   First, as I have noted earlier in this opinion, and JUS-\nTICE STEVENS argued in dissent, the history discussed in\nHeller shows that the Second Amendment was enacted\nprimarily for the purpose of protecting militia-related\nrights. See supra, at 4; Heller, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5–\n31). Many of the scholars and historians who have written\non the subject apparently agree. See supra, at 2–5.\n   Second, historians now tell us that the right to which\nBlackstone referred, an important link in the Heller ma\njority’s historical argument, concerned the right of Par\nliament (representing the people) to form a militia to\noppose a tyrant (the King) threatening to deprive the\npeople of their traditional liberties (which did not include\nan unregulated right to possess guns). Thus, 18th-century\nlanguage referring to a “right to keep and bear arms” does\nnot ipso facto refer to a private right of self-defense—\ncertainly not unambiguously so. See English Historians’\nBrief 3–27; see also supra, at 2–5.\n\f22                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n  Third, scholarly articles indicate that firearms were\nheavily regulated at the time of the framing—perhaps\nmore heavily regulated than the Court in Heller believed.\nFor example, one scholar writes that “[h]undreds of indi\nvidual statutes regulated the possession and use of guns\nin colonial and early national America.” Churchill, Gun\nRegulation, the Police Power, and the Right to Keep Arms,\n25 Law & Hist. Rev. 139, 143 (2007). Among these stat\nutes was a ban on the private firing of weapons in Boston,\nas well as comprehensive restrictions on similar conduct\nin Philadelphia and New York. See Acts and Laws of\nMassachusetts, p. 208 (1746); 5 J. Mitchell, & H. Flanders,\nStatutes at Large of Pennsylvania From 1682 to 1801, pp.\n108–109 (1898); 4 Colonial Laws of New York ch. 1233, p.\n748 (1894); see also Churchill, supra, at 162–163 (discuss\ning bans on the shooting of guns in Pennsylvania and New\nYork).\n  Fourth, after the Constitution was adopted, several\nStates continued to regulate firearms possession by, for\nexample, adopting rules that would have prevented the\ncarrying of loaded firearms in the city, Heller, 554 U. S., at\n___ (slip op., at 5–7) (BREYER, J., dissenting); see also id.,\nat ___ (slip op., at 59–60). Scholars have thus concluded\nthat the primary Revolutionary era limitation on a State’s\npolice power to regulate guns appears to be only that\nregulations were “aimed at a legitimate public purpose”\nand “consistent with reason.” Cornell, Early American\nGun Regulation and the Second Amendment, 25 Law &\nHist. Rev. 197, 198 (2007).\nThe Pre-Civil War Nineteenth Century\n   I would also augment the majority’s account of this\nperiod as follows:\n   First, additional States began to regulate the discharge\nof firearms in public places. See, e.g., Act of Feb. 17, 1831,\n§6, reprinted in 3 Statutes of Ohio and the Northwestern\n\f                 Cite as: 561 U.

Acts 306.\n   Second, States began to regulate the possession of con\ncealed weapons, which were both popular and dangerous.\nSee, e.g., C. Cramer, Concealed Weapon Laws of the Early\nRepublic 143–152 (1999) (collecting examples); see also\n1837–1838 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 137, pp. 200–201 (banning\nthe wearing, sale, or giving of Bowie knives); 1847 Va.\nActs ch. 7, §8, p. 110, (“Any free person who shall habitu\nally carry about his person, hidden from common observa\ntion, any pistol, dirk, bowie knife, or weapon of the like\nkind, from the use of which the death of any person might\nprobably ensue, shall for every offense be punished by [a]\nfine not exceed fifty dollars”).\n   State courts repeatedly upheld the validity of such laws,\nfinding that, even when the state constitution granted a\nright to bear arms, the legislature was permitted to, e.g.,\n“abolish” these small, inexpensive, “most dangerous weap\nons entirely from use,” even in self-defense.

See\nante, at 10. The Court’s case for incorporation must thus\nrest on the conclusion that the right to bear arms is “fun\n\f24                  MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndamental.” But the very evidence that it advances in\nsupport of the conclusion that Reconstruction-era Ameri\ncans strongly supported a private self-defense right shows\nwith equal force that Americans wanted African-American\ncitizens to have the same rights to possess guns as did\nwhite citizens. Ante, at 22–33. Here, for example is what\nCongress said when it enacted a Fourteenth Amendment\npredecessor, the Second Freedman’s Bureau Act. It wrote\nthat the statute, in order to secure “the constitutional\nright to bear arms . . . for all citizens,” would assure that\neach citizen:\n     “shall have . . . full and equal benefit of all laws and\n     proceedings concerning personal liberty, personal se\n     curity, and the acquisition, enjoyment, and disposition\n     of estate, real and personal, including the constitu\n     tional right to bear arms, [by securing] . . . to . . . all\n     the citizens of [every] . . . State or district without re\n     spect to race or color, or previous condition of slavery.”\n     §14, 14 Stat. 176–177 (emphasis added).\nThis sounds like an antidiscrimination provision. See\nRosenthal, The New Originalism Meets the Fourteenth\nAmendment: Original Public Meaning and the Problem of\nIncorporation, 18 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 361, 383–384\n(2009) (discussing evidence that the Freedmen’s Bureau\nwas focused on discrimination).\n    Another Fourteenth Amendment predecessor, the Civil\nRights Act of 1866, also took aim at discrimination. See\n§1, 14 Stat. 27 (citizens of “every race and color, without\nregard to any previous condition of slavery or involuntary\nservitude . . . shall have the same right [to engage in\nvarious activities] and to full and equal benefit of all laws\n. . . as is enjoyed by white citizens”). And, of course, the\nFourteenth Amendment itself insists that all States guar\nantee their citizens the “equal protection of the laws.”\n    There is thus every reason to believe that the funda\n\f                  Cite as: 561 U. S. ____ (2010)           25\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nmental concern of the Reconstruction Congress was the\neradication of discrimination, not the provision of a new\nsubstantive right to bear arms free from reasonable state\npolice power regulation. See, e.g., Brief for Municipal\nRespondents 62–69 (discussing congressional record evi\ndence that Reconstruction Congress was concerned about\ndiscrimination). Indeed, why would those who wrote the\nFourteenth Amendment have wanted to give such a right\nto Southerners who had so recently waged war against the\nNorth, and who continued to disarm and oppress recently\nfreed African-American citizens? Cf. Act of Mar. 2, 1867,\n§6, 14 Stat. 487 (disbanding Southern militias because\nthey were, inter alia, disarming the freedmen).\n   Second, firearms regulation in the later part of the 19th\ncentury was common. The majority is correct that the\nFreedmen’s Bureau points to a right to bear arms, and it\nstands to reason, as the majority points out, that “[i]t\nwould have been nonsensical for Congress to guarantee\nthe . . . equal benefit of a . . . right that does not exist.”\nAnte, at 32. But the majority points to no evidence that\nthere existed during this period a fundamental right to\nbear arms for private self-defense immune to the reason\nable exercise of the state police power. See Emberton, The\nLimits of Incorporation: Violence, Gun Rights, and Gun\nRegulation in the Reconstruction South, 17 Stan. L. &\nPol’y Rev. 615, 621–622 (2006) (noting that history shows\nthat “nineteenth-century Americans” were “not opposed to\nthe idea that the state should be able to control the use of\nfirearms”).\n   To the contrary, in the latter half of the 19th century, a\nnumber of state constitutions adopted or amended after\nthe Civil War explicitly recognized the legislature’s gen\neral ability to limit the right to bear arms. See Tex.\nConst., Art. I, §13 (1869) (protecting “the right to keep and\nbear arms,” “under such regulations as the legislature\nmay prescribe”); Idaho Const., Art. I, §11 (1889) (“The\n\f26                 MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\npeople have the right to bear arms . . .; but the Legislature\nshall regulate the exercise of this right by law”); Utah\nConst., Art. I, §6 (1896) (same). And numerous other state\nconstitutional provisions adopted during this period ex\nplicitly granted the legislature various types of regulatory\npower over firearms. See Brief for Thirty-Four Profes\nsional Historians et al. as Amici Curiae 14–15 (hereinafter\nLegal Historians’ Brief).\n   Moreover, four States largely banned the possession of\nall nonmilitary handguns during this period. See 1879\nTenn. Pub. Acts ch. 186, §1 (prohibiting citizens from\ncarrying “publicly or privately, any . . . belt or pocket\npistol, revolver, or any kind of pistol, except the army or\nnavy pistol, usually used in warfare, which shall be car\nried openly in the hand”); 1876 Wyo. Comp. Laws ch. 52,\n§1 (forbidding “concealed or ope[n]” bearing of “any fire\narm or other deadly weapon, within the limits of any city,\ntown or village”); Ark. Act of Apr. 1, 1881, ch. 96, §1 (pro\nhibiting the “wear[ing] or carry[ng]” of “any pistol . . .\nexcept such pistols as are used in the army or navy,”\nexcept while traveling or at home); Tex. Act of Apr. 12,\n1871, ch. 34 (prohibiting the carrying of pistols unless\nthere are “immediate and pressing” reasonable grounds to\nfear “immediate and pressing” attack or for militia ser\nvice). Fifteen States banned the concealed carry of pistols\nand other deadly weapons. See Legal Historians’ Brief 16,\nn. 14. And individual municipalities enacted stringent\ngun controls, often in response to local conditions—Dodge\nCity, Kansas, for example, joined many western cattle\ntowns in banning the carrying of pistols and other danger\nous weapons in response to violence accompanying west\nern cattle drives. See Brief for Municipal Respondents 30\n(citing Dodge City, Kan., Ordinance No. 16, §XI (Sept. 22,\n1876)); D. Courtwright, The Cowboy Subculture, in Guns\nin America: A Reader 96 (J.

The\nTennessee Supreme Court, in upholding a ban on posses\nsion of nonmilitary handguns and certain other weapons,\nsummarized the Reconstruction understanding of the\nstates’ police power to regulate firearms:\n    “Admitting the right of self-defense in its broadest\n    sense, still on sound principle every good citizen is\n    bound to yield his preference as to the means to be\n    used, to the demands of the public good; and where\n    certain weapons are forbidden to be kept or used by the\n    law of the land, in order to the prevention of [sic]\n    crime—a great public end—no man can be permitted\n    to disregard this general end, and demand of the\n    community the right, in order to gratify his whim or\n    willful desire to use a particular weapon in his par\n    ticular self-defense. The law allows ample means of\n    self-defense, without the use of the weapons which we\n    have held may be rightfully prescribed by this statute.\n    The object being to banish these weapons from the\n    community by an absolute prohibition for the preven\n    tion of crime, no man’s particular safety, if such case\n    could exist, ought to be allowed to defeat this end.”\n    Andrews v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tenn.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 188–189 (1871) (em\n    phasis added).\nThe Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n  Although the majority does not discuss 20th- or 21st\ncentury evidence concerning the Second Amendment at\nany length, I think that it is essential to consider the\nrecent history of the right to bear arms for private self\ndefense when considering whether the right is “fundamen\n\f28                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ntal.” To that end, many States now provide state constitu\ntional protection for an individual’s right to keep and bear\narms. See Volokh, State Constitutional Rights to Keep\nand Bear Arms, 11 Tex. Rev. L. & Pol. 191, 205 (2006)\n(identifying over 40 States). In determining the impor\ntance of this fact, we should keep the following considera\ntions in mind:\n   First, by the end of the 20th century, in every State and\nmany local communities, highly detailed and complicated\nregulatory schemes governed (and continue to govern)\nnearly every aspect of firearm ownership: Who may sell\nguns and how they must be sold; who may purchase guns\nand what type of guns may be purchased; how firearms\nmust be stored and where they may be used; and so on.\nSee generally Legal Community Against Violence, Regu\nlating Guns In America (2008), available at http://\nwww.lcav.org/publications-briefs/regulating_guns. asp (all\nInternet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available\nin Clerk of Court’s case file) (detailing various arms regu\nlations in every State).\n   Of particular relevance here, some municipalities ban\nhandguns, even in States that constitutionally protect the\nright to bear arms. See Chicago, Ill., Municipal Code, §8–\n20–050(c) (2009); Oak Park, Ill., Municipal Code, §§27–2–\n1, 27–1–1 (1995); Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code, ch. 549.25\n(2010). Moreover, at least seven States and Puerto Rico\nban assault weapons or semiautomatic weapons. See Cal.\nPenal Code Ann. §12280(b) (West Supp. 2009); Conn. Gen.\nStat. Ann. §53–202c (2007); Haw. Rev.

Law Code Ann. §4–303\n(Lexis 2002).\n   Second, as I stated earlier, state courts in States with\nconstitutions that provide gun rights have almost uni\nformly interpreted those rights as providing protection\nonly against unreasonable regulation of guns. See, e.g.,\nWinkler, Scrutinizing 686 (the “courts of every state to\nconsider” a gun regulation apply the “ ‘reasonable regula\ntion’ ” approach); State v. McAdams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155863\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155863/state-v-mcadams/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238\n(Wyo. 1986); Robertson v.

See Winkler, Scrutinizing 723\n(identifying only six cases in the 60 years before the arti\ncle’s publication striking down gun control laws: three that\nbanned “the transportation of any firearms for any pur\npose whatsoever,” a single “permitting law,” and two as\napplied challenges in “unusual circumstances”). Hence, as\nevidenced by the breadth of existing regulations, States\nand local governments maintain substantial flexibility to\nregulate firearms—much as they seemingly have through\nout the Nation’s history—even in those States with an\narms right in their constitutions.\n\f30                MCDONALD v. CHICAGO\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n    Although one scholar implies that state courts are less\nwilling to permit total gun prohibitions, see Volokh, Im\nplementing the Right to Keep and Bear Arms for Self-\nDefense: An Analytical Framework and a Research\nAgenda, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1443, 1458 (2009), I am aware\nof no instances in the past 50 years in which a state court\nhas struck down as unconstitutional a law banning a\nparticular class of firearms, see Winkler, Scrutinizing 723.\n   Indeed, state courts have specifically upheld as constitu\ntional (under their state constitutions) firearms regula\ntions that have included handgun bans. See Kalodimos v.\nVillage of Morton Grove, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022759/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2022759\"><a href=\"/opinion/2022759/kalodimos-v-village-of-morton-grove/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 273 (1984) (upholding a handgun ban because the\narms right is merely a right “to possess some form of\nweapon suitable for self-defense or recreation”); Cleveland\nv.

There has been, and is, no consensus that the\nright is, or was, “fundamental.” No broader constitutional\ninterest or principle supports legal treatment of that right\nas fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional\nconcerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against\nthat treatment.\n   Moreover, nothing in 18th-, 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century\nhistory shows a consensus that the right to private armed\nself-defense, as described in Heller, is “deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history or tradition” or is otherwise “funda\nmental.” Indeed, incorporating the right recognized in\nHeller may change the law in many of the 50 States. Read\nin the majority’s favor, the historical evidence is at most\nambiguous. And, in the absence of any other support for\nits conclusion, ambiguous history cannot show that the\nFourteenth Amendment incorporates a private right of\nself-defense against the States.\n   With respect, I dissent.\n\f32                  MCDONALD v.
