Scheindlin, Judge) to resolve in the\n\ndefendants’ favor these proposed class-action suits brought under the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”),\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1350, on behalf of those harmed by the decades-long South African legal regime known\n\nas “apartheid.” The plaintiffs seek damages for violations of customary international law committed\n\nby the South African government, allegedly aided and abetted by the South African subsidiary\n\ncompanies of the named corporate defendants—Daimler, Ford, and IBM. In short, the plaintiffs\n\nclaim that these subsidiary companies sold cars and computers to the South African government,\n\nthus making the defendants, their parent companies, liable for the apartheid regime’s innumerable\n\nrace-based depredations and injustices, including rape, torture, and extrajudicial killings.\n\n        Although the plaintiffs did not claim that any of the South African government’s alleged\n\nviolations of the law of nations occurred in the United States, at the time they filed their complaint\n\nthey assumed (as did most American courts) that no such geographical connection was necessary.\n\nBased on the same assumption, the District Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, which\n\nhad asserted various grounds for dismissal, including that claims brought under the ATS cannot be\n\nbased on “extraterritorial” conduct—i.e., conduct that occurred in the territory of a sovereign other\n\nthan the United States. The District Court denied a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal, and\n\nthe defendants thereupon sought immediate appellate review through a writ of mandamus and by\n\ninvocation of the “collateral order” doctrine.\n\n        This putative appeal, held in abeyance pending a decision by the Supreme Court that was not\n\nissued until 2013, and now pending for four years, involves challenging and important questions\n\nregarding the immediate appealability of certain orders in cases brought under the Alien Tort\n\nStatute, where the United States government has informed the district court that the ongoing\n\n\n                                                    2\n\flitigation substantially threatens American foreign policy. We no longer need to answer those\n\nquestions, however, because all of the underlying claims are plainly barred by the recent opinion of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659 (2013), which held that\n\nfederal courts may not, under the ATS, recognize common-law causes of action for conduct\n\noccurring in the territory of another sovereign. Id. at 1668–69. Because that decision provides a\n\nsufficient ground for dismissing all of the remaining claims, we deny mandamus relief. For the same\n\nreason, we conclude that the interests of judicial economy, and of the parties, are best served by\n\nholding this putative appeal in abeyance and enabling the District Court to consider a motion to\n\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ remaining claims. The parties can then inform this Court, when appropriate,\n\nwhether this appeal has been rendered moot.\n\n        Accordingly, the petition for a writ of mandamus is DENIED; the stay on proceedings in\n\nthe District Court is VACATED; and any appellate jurisdiction that this Court may have pursuant\n\nto the collateral order doctrine is held in abeyance.\n\n                                        LISA S.

CABRANES, Circuit Judge:\n\n         The question presented is whether to issue a writ of mandamus to resolve in favor of the\n\ndefendants this long-lived litigation under the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”)—a statute, passed in 1789,\n\nthat was rediscovered and revitalized by the courts in recent decades to permit aliens to sue for\n\nalleged serious violations of human rights occurring abroad. The statute was first deployed in 1980\n\nagainst individual defendants alleged to have perpetrated crimes against humanity, and beginning in\n\n1997, some courts have extended its reach to suits against corporate defendants as well. See Kiobel v.\n\nRoyal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir. 2010), aff’d on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 1659\n\n(2013). We consider this question in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision that federal courts\n\nmay not, under the ATS, recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in another\n\ncountry.\n\n         In these putative class-action suits brought on behalf of those harmed by the decades-long\n\nSouth African legal regime known as “apartheid,” the plaintiffs assert that the South African\n\nsubsidiary companies of the named corporate defendants—Daimler, Ford, and IBM (the\n\n“defendants”)—aided and abetted violations of customary international law committed by the South\n\nAfrican government.1 In short, the plaintiffs claim that these subsidiary companies sold cars and\n\n\n    1The suits were originally brought by two groups of plaintiffs, the Balintulo plaintiffs (also referred to as the\nKhulumani plaintiffs) and the Ntsebeza plaintiffs, see Part I.A, post, against a broad and diverse group of corporate\ndefendants, over fifty in number and representing a broad cross-section of the international economy.\n\n                                                              7\n\fcomputers to the South African government, thus facilitating the apartheid regime’s innumerable\n\nrace-based depredations and injustices, including rape, torture, and extrajudicial killings.\n\n          The plaintiffs brought these suits over ten years ago in federal court under the ATS, which\n\nconfers federal jurisdiction over “any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation\n\nof the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350. Although the plaintiffs did\n\nnot claim that any of the South African government’s alleged violations of the law of nations2\n\noccurred in the United States, at the time they filed their complaint they assumed (as did most\n\n\n     The Balintulo plaintiffs sued twenty-three named foreign and domestic corporations: AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie,\nBarclays National Bank Ltd., British Petroleum, PLC, ChevronTexaco Corp., ChevronTexaco Global Energy, Inc.,\nCitigroup, Inc., Commerzbank, Credit Suisse Group, DaimlerChrysler AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Dresdner Bank AG,\nExxon Mobil Corp., Fluor Corp., Ford Motor Co., Fujitsu, Ltd., General Motors Corp., IBM Corp., J.P.

Peru Copper Corp., 414 F.3d 233, 237 n.2 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal citations omitted), “composed only of\nthose rules that States universally abide by, or accede to, out of a sense of legal obligation and mutual concern,” id. at\n248, i.e., “the specific and universally accepted rules that the nations of the world treat as binding in their dealings with one\nanother,” Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 118 (2d Cir. 2010), aff’d on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 1659 (2013).\nAs Judge Friendly explained long ago, these rules include only “those standards, rules or customs (a) affecting the\nrelationship between states or between an individual and a foreign state, and (b) used by those states for their common\ngood and/or in dealings inter se.” IIT v. Vencap, Ltd., 519 F.2d 1001, 1015 (2d Cir. 1975), abrogated on other grounds by\nMorrison v. Nat’l Austl. Bank Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 2869 (2010); see also Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F.2d 876, 888 (2d Cir. 1980) (“It\nis only where the nations of the world have demonstrated that the wrong is of mutual, and not merely several, concern, by\nmeans of express international accords, that a wrong generally recognized becomes an international law violation within\nthe meaning of the [ATS].” (emphasis supplied)). The wrongs condemned by customary international law include those\nheinous criminal offenses that fall under the general headings of war crimes and crimes against humanity. See Presbyterian\nChurch of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 582 F.3d 244, 257 n.7 (2d Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56,\n103–04 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting the “strictly limited set of crimes” that are “uniformly recognized by the ‘civilized nations’\nas . . . offense[s] against the ‘Law of Nations’”). Certain violations of customary international law, however, can become\nactionable in civil lawsuits by virtue of legislative command. See Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. 692, 738 n.29 (2004)\n(noting the distinction between a rule of customary international law and a private right of action); see also Medellin v.\nTexas, 552 U.S. 491, 506 n.3 (2008) (identifying a similar principle with respect to treaty law).\n\n                                                                8\n\fAmerican courts at that time3) that no such geographical connection was necessary. Based, in part,\n\non that assumption, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Shira\n\nA. Scheindlin, Judge)4 denied a motion to dismiss by the defendants, and allowed the suits to proceed.\n\nSee In re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 228, 246, 296 (S.D.N.Y. 2009).\n\n          Although parties usually cannot appeal while district court proceedings are ongoing, the\n\ndefendants sought immediate review of the District Court’s denial of their motion to dismiss in this\n\nCourt, first through a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal, which the District Court denied, and\n\nthereupon through either a writ of mandamus or under the “collateral order” doctrine5—both of\n\nwhich permit immediate appellate review of certain types of particularly important decisions by a\n\ndistrict court. In pursuing appellate review, the defendants claimed (1) that the case should be\n\ndismissed because it threatened significant United States foreign-policy interests, as explained in a\n\nstatement of interest filed by the U.S. government; (2) that the jurisdiction conferred by the ATS\n\ndoes not permit suits against corporations or apply to acts committed outside of the United States;\n\nand (3) that the District Court erroneously imposed accessorial liability. We then granted the\n\ndefendants’ motion for a stay of all proceedings, putting the District Court proceedings on pause\n\nwhile we considered this case.\n\n          Now on appeal for over four years, this case has been overtaken by recent events. Most\n\nsignificantly, the Supreme Court held, as a matter of United States law, that federal courts may not,\n\nunder the ATS, recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in the territory of\n\n\n     3 See, e.g., Flomo v. Firestone Nat’l Rubber Co., LLC, 643 F.3d 1013, 1025 (7th Cir. 2011) (“[N]o court to our knowledge\n\nhas ever held that [the ATS] doesn’t apply extraterritorially.”).\n     4 The suits were brought in various districts but were transferred to the Southern District of New York by the\n\nJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. See In re South African Apartheid Litigation, 238 F. Supp. 2d 1379 (JPML 2002).\nThe cases were originally assigned to Judge John E. Sprizzo, but they were reassigned to Judge Shira A. Scheindlin\nfollowing the death of Judge Sprizzo in 2008.\n    5 See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949); see also Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100,\n\n106–07 (2009); Liberty Synergistics Inc. v. Microflo Ltd., 718 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir. 2013).\n\n\n                                                                9\n\fanother sovereign. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659, 1668–69 (2013).6 Additionally,\n\nthe South African government—which had previously opposed the suits because they “interfere[d]\n\nwith the policy embodied by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542\n\nU.S. 692, 733 n.21 (2004)—reversed its position in September 2009 after a change in governmental\n\nleadership. After this series of twists and turns, the parties submitted supplemental briefing, and we\n\nhave now reached a decision.\n\n         The opinion of the Supreme Court in Kiobel plainly bars common-law suits, like this one,\n\nalleging violations of customary international law based solely on conduct occurring abroad.\n\nBecause of that unambiguous holding, the defendants will be able to obtain their desired relief\n\n(dismissal of all claims) in the District Court through a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n\nwithout resort to a writ of mandamus. The defendants’ request for mandamus relief is therefore\n\ndenied. For the same reason, we need not consider the defendants’ argument under the collateral\n\norder doctrine. Instead, we vacate our stay on the District Court proceedings so that the defendants\n\nmay move for judgment on the pleadings. We reserve the question whether we have jurisdiction\n\nunder the collateral order doctrine and hold the putative appeal under that doctrine in abeyance\n\npending further notice from the parties.\n\n                                                    I. Background\n\n                                                   A. The Pleadings\n\n         These consolidated cases come to us as a continuation of litigation on which the District\n\nCourt, this Court, and even the Supreme Court, have already spoken at length. See Part I.B., post. In\n\nthe latest iteration of pleadings, which have been amended twice, the plaintiffs assert that the South\n\nAfrican subsidiaries of the various corporate defendants aided and abetted in violations of\n\n     6 This decision followed in time our holdings that “the mens rea standard for aiding and abetting liability in ATS\n\nactions is purpose rather than knowledge alone,” Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 582 F.3d 244, 259 (2d\nCir. 2009), and that customary international law does not presently recognize corporate liability, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch\nPetroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 149 (2d Cir. 2010), reh’g en banc denied, 642 F.3d 379 (2011).\n\n                                                             10\n\fcustomary international law during the repressive “apartheid” legal regime in South Africa. The\n\nDistrict Court summarized these allegations as follows:\n\n              Plaintiffs in the first action, Ntsebeza v. Daimler A.G. (“Ntsebeza plaintiffs”), allege\n          that they suffered discriminatory employment practices, employment retaliation for\n          political beliefs, geographic segregation, arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, forced\n          exile, arbitrary denationalization, and the extrajudicial killing of family members. The\n          Ntsebeza plaintiffs bring a class action on behalf of “themselves and all black South\n          African citizens (and their heirs and beneficiaries) who during the period from 1973\n          to 1994 suffered injuries” as a result of defendants’ direct and secondary violations of\n          the law of nations.\n              Plaintiffs in the second action, Khulumani v. Barclays National Bank Ltd.\n          (“Khulumani plaintiffs”), include both Khulumani—a South African organization that\n          “works to assist victims of apartheid-era violence”—and individuals who suffered\n          geographic segregation, arbitrary arrest and detention, rape, torture, and the\n          extrajudicial killing of family members. . . .\n          ....\n              The Ntsebeza plaintiffs allege that the automotive defendants—or their agents or\n          alter egos—committed both direct and secondary violations of the law of nations by\n          engaging in workplace discrimination that mimicked and enhanced apartheid,\n          suppressing union activities, manufacturing military vehicles for the South African\n          security forces in the face of worker protests, and assisting security forces in\n          identifying and torturing anti-apartheid leaders. The Ntsebeza plaintiffs additionally\n          allege that defendant IBM—or its agents or alter egos—committed secondary\n          violations of the law of nations by providing the computer hardware, software,\n          maintenance, and support necessary for the South African Government to carry out\n          geographic segregation and denationalization. . . .\n              The Khulumani plaintiffs allege that the automotive defendants aided and abetted\n          violations of the law of nations by supplying vehicles, parts, and other equipment to\n          the apartheid security forces. The Khulumani plaintiffs additionally allege that the\n          technology defendants aided and abetted violations of the law of nations by\n          providing the computer systems necessary to restrict black South Africans’\n          movements, track dissidents, and target particular individuals for repressive acts.\n\nIn re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d at 241–43.\n\n                                                 B.

In re South African Apartheid Litig., 346\n\nF. Supp. 2d 538, 546, 548 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). We reversed that judgment in part, explaining in a per\n\ncuriam opinion that “a plaintiff may plead a theory of aiding and abetting liability” under the ATS,\n\nKhulumani v. Barclay Nat’l Bank Ltd., 504 F.3d 254, 260 (2d Cir. 2007) (per curiam), but we declined to\n\nreach other arguments, and instead permitted the plaintiffs to replead, id. at 260–61.8 After the\n\ndefendants sought a writ of certiorari, the Supreme Court affirmed our decision for want of a\n\nquorum. See Am. Isuzu Motors, Inc., v. Ntsebeza, 553 U.S. 1028 (2008) (Mem.).\n\n         On remand, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, this time naming only eight\n\ndefendants.9 With the exception of one defendant that contested personal jurisdiction, the\n\ndefendants then filed a joint motion to dismiss on various grounds, including doctrines of case-\n\nspecific deference and international comity, lack of jurisdiction over corporations under the ATS,\n\nlack of extraterritorial reach for causes of action under the ATS, and the absence of aiding-and-\n\nabetting liability under the federal common law, as developed pursuant to Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain,\n\n542 U.S. 692 (2004). Judge Scheindlin, to whom the case was assigned following the death of Judge\n\nSprizzo, rejected each of these arguments, and held that the suit could proceed on an agency theory,\n\nunder which the corporate defendants could be held liable for the actions of their South African\n\n\n\n\nNtsebeza, 553 U.S. 1028 (2008) (Mem.), on remand, In re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 228 (S.D.N.Y. 2009);\nsee also Sosa, 542 U.S. at 733 n.21 (referring, by name, to this particular suit as one that may warrant dismissal, and\ncommenting that “there is a strong argument that federal courts should give serious weight to the Executive Branch’s\nview of the case’s impact on foreign policy”).\n    8 Each of the three judges on the Khulumani panel filed a separate opinion. 504 F.3d at 264–84 (Katzmann, J.,\n\nconcurring); id. at 284–92 (Hall, J., concurring); id. at 292–337 (Korman, J., dissenting).\n     9 The Ntsebeza plaintiffs named Ford, General Motors Corp., Daimler, IBM, and Barclays Bank PLC. The Balintulo\n\nplaintiffs named those five companies as well as UBS AG, Fujitsu Ltd., and Rheinmetall AG.\n\n                                                            12\n\fsubsidiaries.10 See In re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d at 274–76. She explained that\n\nthe South African subsidiary companies could be liable as accessories based on their knowledge that\n\ntheir dealings with the South African government facilitated the many evils of apartheid, even if the\n\ncompanies did not intend their assistance to have that effect.11 Id. at 259–62. Following the District\n\nCourt’s denial of certification, see In re South African Apartheid Litig., 624 F. Supp. 2d 336 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n2009), the defendants brought this petition for a writ of mandamus, and a putative appeal under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine, arguing that “the District Court’s denial of dismissal should be reversed,\n\nand the cases remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaints.” Defendants’ Br. 59.12\n\n          We initially heard argument on a variety of preliminary motions on September 1, 2009. Only\n\na day after argument, we received a letter from the South African government reversing its earlier\n\nposition and declaring that it was “now of the view that [the United States District Court for the\n\nSouthern District of New York] is an appropriate forum to hear the remaining claims of aiding and\n\nabetting in violation of international law.” See Letter of Jeffrey Thamsanqa Radebe, Minister of\n\nJustice and Constitutional Development, Sept. 2, 2009; see also Sosa, 542 U.S. at 733 n.21 (explaining\n\n\n     10Judge Scheindlin dismissed claims made by the Khulumani (or Balintulo) plaintiffs in the First Amended complaint\non the basis of insufficient allegations concerning vicarious liability, see In re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d\nat 275-76, but she allowed those claims to proceed once the plaintiffs amended the complaint a second time.\n     11  Our Court later held that “the mens rea standard for aiding and abetting liability in ATS actions is purpose rather\nthan knowledge alone.” Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., 582 F.3d 244, 259 (2d Cir. 2009).\nAccordingly, “supplying . . . equipment to a local government will not support the imposition of aiding and abetting\nliability . . . for that government’s abuses unless the [defendant] acted with a purpose to promote or advance those\nviolations.” Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 158 (2d Cir. 2010) (Leval, J., concurring). The District\nCourt denied certification with respect to this issue, stating that the plaintiffs had, in its view, “advanced numerous\nallegations evincing specific intent, particularly concerning the automotive defendants,” and therefore “[e]ven if the\nSecond Circuit or the Supreme Court were to determine that intent or shared purpose is the proper mens rea requirement,\nplaintiffs would undoubtedly fight on.” See In re South African Apartheid Litig., 624 F. Supp. 2d at 343. The defendants,\nhowever, also argue that our decision in Presbyterian Church—which adopted a rule proposed by Judge Katzmann’s\nconcurring opinion in Khulumani as the law of the Circuit, see 582 F.3d at 258—addresses only the threshold question\nwhether, and by what mens rea standard, a court has subject-matter jurisdiction under the ATS for aiding-and-abetting liability,\nleaving open the secondary question whether federal courts should “decline to provide a cause of action,” as a matter of\nfederal common law, for accessorial liability. Khulumani, 504 F.3d at 269 (Katzmann, J., concurring); see id. at 267–68,\n283 n.18. Because of our disposition of this case, we have no occasion to address that argument.\n     12Because we consider only whether to issue mandamus, and not whether the District Court’s order was appealable\nunder the collateral order doctrine, we do not address the plaintiffs’ argument that the defendants’ notice of appeal was\nuntimely. See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 378–79 (2004).\n\n                                                               13\n\fthe South African government’s prior position). We then stayed the District Court proceedings13\n\nand ordered a limited remand to that Court “for the sole purpose of permitting defendants to move\n\nto certify an interlocutory appeal” on the question whether the ATS recognizes corporate liability.\n\nOrder of Dec. 18, 2009. The District Court denied certification, explaining that although the\n\nquestion of corporate liability under the ATS was “a controlling issue of law” that “could materially\n\nadvance the ultimate termination of this litigation,” that question was “long-settled . . . in this\n\nCircuit,” with “no substantial ground for disagreement.” In re South African Apartheid Litig., 2009 WL\n\n5177981, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 31, 2009) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n         Less than a year later, this Court (in a separate case) held that “the Alien Tort Statute does\n\nnot provide subject matter jurisdiction over claims against corporations” based on asserted\n\nviolations of customary international law. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 149 (2d\n\nCir. 2010), reh’g en banc denied, 642 F.3d 379 (2011). The Supreme Court granted certiorari and, after\n\nreargument,14 affirmed our judgment on different grounds, holding that federal courts may not,\n\nunder the ATS, recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in the territory of\n\n     13 See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010) (noting authority to stay proceedings pending mandamus\n\nreview).\n    14 The Supreme Court initially granted the petition for a writ of certiorari on October 17, 2011. See Kiobel v. Royal\n\nDutch Petroleum Co., 132 S. Ct. 472 (2011) (Mem.). The petition raised the following two questions:\n         1. Whether the issue of corporate civil tort liability under the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”), 28 U.S.C.\n         § 1350, is a merits question, as it has been treated by all courts prior to the decision below, or an issue\n         of subject matter jurisdiction, as the court of appeals held for the first time.\n         2. Whether corporations are immune from tort liability for violations of the law of nations such as\n         torture, extrajudicial executions or genocide, as the court of appeals decisions provides, or if\n         corporations may be sued in the same manner as any other private party defendant under the ATS for\n         such egregious violations, as the Eleventh Circuit has explicitly held.\nPetition for Writ of Certiorari, Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., No. 10-1491, 2011 WL 2326721, at *i.\n     The Court heard argument on February 28, 2012, and then on March 5, 2012, ordered supplemental briefing and\nreargument to consider the following question:\n         Whether and under what circumstances the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350, allows courts to\n         recognize a cause of action for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a\n         sovereign other than the United States.\nKiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 132 S. Ct. 1738 (2012) (Mem.). The Court heard reargument on October 1, 2012, and\nissued its decision on April 17, 2013. See Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659 (2013).\n\n                                                             14\n\fanother sovereign. Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct. 1659, 1668–69 (2013). With respect\n\nto the present suit, we then requested, and have now received, supplemental briefing from the\n\nparties.\n\n                                                      II. Discussion\n\n           The defendants seek a writ of mandamus under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651,15 and, in\n\nthe alternative, argue that we have appellate jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, see\n\nMohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S. 100, 106–07 (2009) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp.,\n\n337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949)). The defendants further argue that, if we do have jurisdiction under the\n\ncollateral order doctrine to consider the District Court’s decision not to dismiss the suit based on\n\ncase-specific deference or international comity, see Sosa, 542 U.S. at 733 n.21, we may also recognize\n\nany defect in subject-matter jurisdiction, see In re Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether Prods. Liability Litig., 488\n\nF.3d 112, 122 (2d Cir. 2007). We address these arguments in turn.\n\n                                                 A. Writ of Mandamus\n\n                                                               i.\n\n           As a general matter, denials of a motion to dismiss are not appealable as “final decisions” of\n\nthe district courts under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.16 See Catlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 236 (1945).\n\nNonetheless, federal procedural law provides two “discretionary review mechanisms” that “serve as\n\nuseful ‘safety valve[s]’ for promptly correcting serious errors.” Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 111\n\n(quoting Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 883 (1994)) (alteration in\n\noriginal). First, a district court may certify an appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) when it is “of\n\nthe opinion that [the relevant] order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is\n\n\n     15 The All Writs Act provides, in relevant part, that federal courts “may issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid\n\nof their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651.\n      16 28 U.S.C. § 1291 provides, in relevant part, that “[t]he courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from\n\nall final decisions of the district courts of the United States.”\n\n                                                               15\n\fsubstantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may\n\nmaterially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b). When a ruling\n\nsatisfies these criteria and “involves a new legal question or is of special consequence,” then the\n\ndistrict court “should not hesitate to certify an interlocutory appeal.” Mohawk, 558 U.S. at 111. The\n\nrelevant Court of Appeals may then, “in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such\n\norder.”17 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\n         If a district court refuses certification, or certification is not otherwise available, however,\n\nthen a party may petition for a writ of mandamus—“a drastic and extraordinary remedy reserved for\n\nreally extraordinary causes.” Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); see also Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 107 (1967) (noting that the writ of\n\nmandamus is one of “the most potent weapons in the judicial arsenal”); note 15, ante (common-law\n\nremedy codified in the All Writs Act). Three conditions circumscribe use of the writ:\n\n         First, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to\n         attain the relief he desires—a condition designed to ensure that the writ will not be\n         used as a substitute for the regular appeals process. Second, the petitioner must\n         satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and\n         indisputable. Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing\n         court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate\n         under the circumstances.\n\nCheney, 542 U.S. at 380–81 (alternations, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted).\n\nMandamus relief is appropriate “in extraordinary circumstances,” when, for example, a district\n\ncourt’s order “amounts to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\nworks a manifest injustice.” Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 111 (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).18\n\n\n    17  “Permissive interlocutory appeal,” a leading treatise observes, “can reduce the need to develop extraordinary-writ\npractice to fill the inevitable gaps in provisions for appeal as a matter of right.” 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3929.1 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n    18 It is important to note, however, that mandamus relief does not impeach a judge’s competence and “is not a\npunitive remedy.” Will, 389 U.S. at 107; see also In re Chambers Dev. Co., 148 F.3d 214, 223 n.7 (3d Cir. 1998) (noting that,\n\n                                                             16\n\f         Two aspects of ATS jurisprudence, however, urge greater appellate oversight through use of\n\nmandamus in appropriate cases. First, ATS suits often create particular “risks of adverse foreign\n\npolicy consequences,” Sosa, 542 U.S. at 728, obliging courts to be “particularly wary of impinging on\n\nthe discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs,” id. at 727.\n\nThis risk of treading into matters within the province of other branches of government, and\n\nintruding into delicate areas of intergovernmental relations, warrants closer appellate scrutiny\n\nthrough supervisory mandamus review. See Cheney, 542 U.S. at 380–82. Appellate courts have\n\ntherefore been less hesitant to issue the writ when a lower-court decision threatens to affect the\n\nforeign policy of the United States. See, e.g., Ex parte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 586 (1943); In re\n\nAustrian, German Holocaust Litig., 250 F.3d 156, 163–65 (2d Cir. 2001); Abelesz v. OTP Bank, 692 F.3d\n\n638, 651 (7th Cir. 2012). Second, and relatedly, the ATS places federal judges in an unusual\n\nlawmaking role as creators of federal common law. See Sosa, 542 U.S. at 724–25. This exercise of\n\nauthority by federal courts elevates “the danger of unwarranted judicial interference in the conduct\n\nof foreign policy,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1664, again warranting greater appellate oversight, see Cheney,\n\n542 U.S. at 380–82. In sum, a ruling that raises substantial questions of judicial power under the\n\n\n\n\nfollowing a legislative revision in 1996, district court judges are no longer treated as respondents in mandamus actions).\nAs we recently observed, “[t]he word ‘abuse’ in the ‘abuse of discretion’ standard is an unfortunate—and inaccurate—\nterm of art.” In re City of New York, 607 F.3d 923, 943 n.21 (2d Cir. 2010). A district court “abuses” its discretion if (1) it\n“makes an error of law,” Fox v. Vice, 131 S. Ct. 2205, 2216 (2011) (quoting Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 100 (1996)),\n(2) makes a “clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,” Cheney, 542 U.S. at 381, or (3) renders a decision outside the\nrange of permissible decisions, In re Sims, 534 F.3d 117, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). An abuse of discretion thus “involves\nnothing as heinous as abuse” in its ordinary connotation. In re City of New York, 607 F.3d at 943 n.21.\n      Accordingly, mandamus relief can be appropriate even when the district court’s opinion resolved “novel legal\nquestions that were unsettled” at the time of the district court’s decision. In re City of New York, 607 F.3d at 947. Indeed,\nbecause “the writ [can] serve[ ] a vital corrective and didactic function,” Will, 389 U.S. at 107, orders are sometimes more\nappropriate candidates for mandamus when they have “raised a legal issue of first impression in this circuit.” Chase\nManhattan Bank, N.A. v. Turner & Newall, PLC, 964 F.2d 159, 163 (2d Cir. 1992); see also In re Sims, 534 F.3d at 128–29;\nIn re United States, 903 F.2d 88, 89 (2d Cir. 1990). The Supreme Court, for instance, has distinguished between “the\nordinary situation . . . [where] mandamus is not an appropriate remedy, absent, of course, a clear abuse of discretion,”\nfrom “special circumstances” where immediately reviewing a question bearing on the lower court’s power would “avoid\npiecemeal litigation and . . . settle new and important problems.” Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 111 (1964); see also\nIn re S.E.C., 374 F.3d 184, 188 n.2 (2d Cir. 2004).\n\n                                                              17\n\fATS and threatens to affect significant American foreign policy objectives cannot be insulated from\n\nimmediate review simply because a lower court refuses to certify the order for appeal.\n\n        Such concerns are present here. In addition to the federal common-law aspect of these ATS\n\nsuits, the United States government filed a statement of interest on October 30, 2003, articulating its\n\nposition that “continued adjudication of [these] matters risks potentially serious adverse\n\nconsequences for significant interests of the United States.”19 Def. App’x 254. The statement of\n\ninterest further explains:\n\n        We are also concerned that adjudication of the apartheid cases may deter foreign\n        investment where it is most needed. The United States relies, in significant part, on\n        economic ties and investment to encourage and promote change in the domestic\n        policies of developing countries on issues relevant to U.S. interests, such as respect\n        for human rights and reduction of poverty. However, the prospect of costly\n        litigation and potential liability in U.S. courts for operating in a country whose\n        government implements oppressive policies will discourage U.S. (and other foreign)\n        corporations from investment in many areas of the developing world.\n\nId. at 255–56. Such important foreign policy interests as those raised here cannot be vindicated by\n\nwaiting until final judgment.\n\n        Nonetheless, we need not wade into the merits of the defendants’ various arguments,\n\nbecause we are not persuaded that mandamus is the only “adequate means to attain the relief” that\n\nthey desire. For the reasons explained in the following section, see Part II.A.ii., and in light of the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Kiobel that federal courts may not, under the ATS, recognize common-\n\nlaw causes of action for conduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign, Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at\n\n1668–69, defendants can seek the dismissal of all of the plaintiffs’ claims, and prevail, prior to\n\ndiscovery, through a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of\n\n\n\n\n    19 During oral argument on January 11, 2010, the government confirmed that this statement has not been modified\n\nor withdrawn.\n\n                                                        18\n\fCivil Procedure.20 Mandamus with respect to any of the defendants’ various claims of error is,\n\ntherefore, simply unnecessary in light of the Supreme Court’s clear guidance that claims based on\n\nconduct occurring solely abroad cannot be adjudicated under the ATS.21\n\n                                                               ii.\n\n          As we have now made clear, Kiobel forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims because the plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to allege that any relevant conduct occurred in the United States. The plaintiffs resist this\n\nobvious impact of the Kiobel holding on their claims. The Supreme Court’s decision, they argue,\n\ndoes not preclude suits under the ATS based on foreign conduct when the defendants are American\n\nnationals, or where the defendants’ conduct affronts significant American interests identified by the\n\nplaintiffs. See Plaintiffs’ Letter Br. at 6–13. Curiously, this interpretation of Kiobel arrives at precisely\n\nthe conclusion reached by Justice Breyer, who, writing for himself and three colleagues, only\n\nconcurred in the judgment of the Court affirming our decision to dismiss all remaining claims\n\nbrought under the ATS. See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1671 (Breyer, J., concurring). The plaintiffs’\n\nargument, however, seeks to evade the bright-line clarity of the Court’s actual holding—clarity that\n\nensures that the defendants can obtain their desired relief without resort to mandamus. We briefly\n\nhighlight why the plaintiffs’ arguments lack merit.\n\n\n\n\n     20 We note that Daimler, Ford, and IBM filed answers in the District Court on June 22, 2009, thus generally barring\n\nthe filing of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). See generally Kalson v. Paterson, 542 F.3d 281, 288 n.14 (2d Cir. 2008)\n(explaining the relationship between Rule 12(b)(6) and Rule 12(c)).\n     21 In so holding, we are mindful that a decision denying mandamus relief is usually, if not always, an inappropriate\n\noccasion to address novel questions of law, since the authority to issue mandamus is narrowly circumscribed, and a court\nconsidering mandamus generally does not have jurisdiction otherwise. But see Stein v. KPMG, LLP, 486 F.3d 753, 759 (2d\nCir. 2007) (noting that circumstances sometimes “justify the exercise of mandamus power without deciding whether we\nhave appellate jurisdiction”). Here, however, we simply identify the clear holding of the Supreme Court’s decision in\nKiobel and explain why it plainly bars the plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of law, and thus provides the defendants with an\nalternative avenue for obtaining their desired relief. Cf. Chandler v. Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit of the U.S., 398 U.S.\n74, 86 (1970) (denying mandamus by “conclud[ing] that in the present posture of the case other avenues of relief on the\nmerits may yet be open” to the petitioner seeking mandamus). Nor does the unusual posture of our decision cut off\nhigher appellate review; the plaintiffs, should they so desire, may appeal in the normal course following entry of final\njudgment by the District Court.\n\n                                                               19\n\f                                                             a.\n\n         The Supreme Court’s Kiobel decision, the plaintiffs assert, “adopted a new presumption that\n\nATS claims must ‘touch and concern’ the United States with ‘sufficient force’ to state a cause of\n\naction.” Plaintiffs Letter Br. 6 (quoting Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669). The plaintiffs read the opinion of\n\nthe Court as holding only that “mere corporate presence” in the United States is insufficient for a\n\nclaim to “touch and concern” the United States, but that corporate citizenship in the United States is\n\nenough. Id. at 11 (“[I]nternational law violations committed by U.S. citizens on foreign soil ‘touch\n\nand concern’ U.S. territory with ‘sufficient force’ to displace the Kiobel presumption.”). Reaching a\n\nconclusion similar to that of Justice Breyer and the minority of the Supreme Court in Kiobel, the\n\nplaintiffs argue that whether the relevant conduct occurred abroad is simply one prong of a multi-\n\nfactor test, and the ATS still reaches extraterritorial conduct when the defendant is an American\n\nnational. Id. at 8–11.\n\n         We disagree. The Supreme Court expressly held that claims under the ATS cannot be\n\nbrought for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than\n\nthe United States. Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1662, 1668–69. The majority framed the question presented\n\nin these terms no fewer than three times22; it repeated the same language, focusing solely on the\n\nlocation of the relevant “conduct” or “violation,” at least eight more times in other parts of its eight-\n\npage opinion23; and it affirmed our judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims because “all the\n\n\n      22 See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1662 (“The question presented is whether and under what circumstances courts may\n\nrecognize a cause of action under the Alien Tort Statute, for violations of the law of nations occurring within the\nterritory of a sovereign other than the United States.”); id. at 1664 (“The question here is . . . whether a claim may reach\nconduct occurring in the territory of a foreign sovereign.”); id. at 1665 (“[T]he question is whether a cause of action\nunder the ATS reaches conduct within the territory of another sovereign.”).\n    23 See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1665 (text of ATS does not support “application to torts committed abroad”); id. at 1666\n(asking whether Congress “intend[ed] federal law to apply to conduct occurring abroad”); id. (no Congressional intent\n“for those causes of action to reach conduct in the territory of a foreign sovereign”); id. (historical background does not\n“overcome the presumption against application to conduct in the territory of another sovereign”); id. at 1667\n(“[P]rominent contemporary examples” of ATS cases “provide no support for the proposition that Congress expected\ncauses of action to be brought under the statute for violations of the law of nations occurring abroad.”); id. (cause of\naction against pirates not “a sufficient basis for concluding that other causes of action under the ATS reach conduct that\n\n                                                             20\n\frelevant conduct took place outside the United States,” id. at 1669. Lower courts are bound by that\n\nrule and they are without authority to “reinterpret” the Court’s binding precedent in light of\n\nirrelevant factual distinctions, such as the citizenship of the defendants.24 See Agostini v. Felton, 521\n\nU.S. 203, 237–38 (1997); see also Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 66–67 (1996).\n\nAccordingly, if all the relevant conduct occurred abroad, that is simply the end of the matter under\n\nKiobel.\n\n          In the conclusion of its opinion, the Supreme Court stated in dicta that, even when claims\n\nbrought under the ATS “touch and concern the territory of the United States, they must do so with\n\nsufficient force to displace the presumption against extraterritorial application.”25 Kiobel, 133 S. Ct.\n\n\n\ndoes occur within the territory of another sovereign”); id. at 1668-69 (“Nothing about this historical context suggests\nthat Congress also intended federal common law under the ATS to provide a cause of action for conduct occurring in\nthe territory of another sovereign.”); id. at 1669 (“[P]etitioners’ case seeking relief for violations of the law of nations\noccurring outside the United States is barred.”).\n    24  Nothing in the Court’s reasoning in Kiobel suggests that the rule of law it applied somehow depends on a\ndefendant’s citizenship. Indeed, the presumption of extraterritoriality traditionally has “focused on the site of the\nconduct, not the identity of the defendant.” Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 654 F.3d 11, 74-76 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (Kavanaugh,\nJ., dissenting) (describing the history and purpose of the presumption against extraterritoriality); see also Morrison, 130\nS. Ct. at 2884; EEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 255 (1991); Foley Bros. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 286 (1949).\nThe sole reference to U.S. citizenship in the Court’s opinion arose in the course of discussing a 1795 opinion endorsed\nby Attorney General William Bradford—a lone historical source that the Court found to be ambiguous, and insufficient\n“to counter the weighty concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality.” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1668.\nAccordingly, the Court did not suggest that a defendant’s citizenship has any relevance to the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, and it instead stated over and over that the ATS bars suits where the relevant conduct occurs abroad.\nSee notes 22 & 23, ante.\n     25 Part IV, which followed the Supreme Court’s conclusion in Part III that “petitioner’s case seeking relief for\n\nviolations of the law of nations occurring outside the United States is barred,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669, reads as follows:\n          On these facts, all the relevant conduct took place outside the United States. And even where the\n          claims touch and concern the territory of the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to\n          displace the presumption against extraterritorial application. See Morrison, 130 S. Ct. at 2883–88.\n          Corporations are often present in many countries, and it would reach too far to say that mere\n          corporate presence suffices. If Congress were to determine otherwise, a statute more specific than the\n          ATS would be required.\nId. Viewing this paragraph in context, the first sentence relates to this case, and the second sentence relates to ATS cases\nnot already “barred” because all of the relevant conduct occurred abroad. This dichotomy is evident from (1) the\ncontrast between the opening clauses in these two sentences; (2) the Court’s earlier conclusion that “petitioner’s case . . .\nis barred” based solely on the extraterritoriality of the relevant conduct, without consideration of whether other aspects\nof the claim might “touch and concern” the United States; and (3) the Court’s use of the general phrase “they must do\nso,” rather than a case-specific phrase, such as “they do not do so.” Consistent with this view, the reference to\ncorporate presence indicates that mere corporate presence in the United States is not “relevant conduct” when deciding\nwhether an ATS claim avoids the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n\n                                                              21\n\fat 1669 (citing Morrison v. Nat’l Austl. Bank Ltd., 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2883–88 (2010)). As the Court\n\nobserved in Morrison, “the presumption against extraterritorial application would be a craven\n\nwatchdog indeed if it retreated to its kennel whenever some domestic activity is involved in the case.”\n\n130 S. Ct. at 2884. But since all the relevant conduct in Kiobel occurred outside the United States—a\n\ndispositive fact in light of the Supreme Court’s holding—the Court had no reason to explore, much\n\nless explain, how courts should proceed when some of the relevant conduct occurs in the United\n\nStates.26\n\n                                                              b.\n\n         The plaintiffs also assert that “the Kiobel presumption is displaced here” because of the\n\ncompelling American interests in supporting the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nPlaintiffs’ Letter Br. 11. These case-specific policy arguments miss the mark. The canon against\n\nextraterritorial application is “a presumption about a statute’s meaning.” Morrison, 130 S. Ct. at 2877\n\n(emphasis supplied). Its “wisdom,” the Supreme Court has explained, is that, “[r]ather than guess anew\n\nin each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which\n\nCongress can legislate with predictable effects.” Id. at 2881 (emphasis supplied). For that reason,\n\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the statute, or at least the part of the ATS that\n\n“carries with it an opportunity to develop common law,” Sosa, 542 U.S. at 731 n.19, and “allows\n\n\n\n    26  Although joining in the opinion of the Court, Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, indicated a desire to adopt a\nbroader holding, requiring that the “domestic conduct” be “sufficient” to constitute a violation of an appropriate\ninternational law norm. Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1670 (Alito, J., concurring). The Court did not adopt Justice Alito’s broader\nreasoning, but it did not reject it either; the majority simply left open any questions regarding the permissible reach of\ncauses of action under the ATS when “some domestic activity is involved in the case.” Morrison, 130 S. Ct. at 2884; see\nKiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669; see also id. (Kennedy, J., concurring). The Court also did not attempt to answer other questions\ninvolved in defining causes of action, including “who may be liable,” relevant exhaustion rules, and applicable limitations\nperiods. See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1665. The law of this Circuit already provides answers to some of those questions,\nincluding the principle that corporations are not proper defendants under the ATS in light of prevailing customary\ninternational law, see Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 621 F.3d 111, 149 (2d Cir. 2010), reh’g en banc denied, 642 F.3d 379\n(2011), aff’d on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. at 1669, though we have stated that other “unresolved issues [are] lurking in our\nATS jurisprudence,” id. at 117; see also id. at 117 n.10. Like the Supreme Court, we have no reason to address how much\nconduct must occur in the United States because all the relevant conduct that purportedly violated the law of nations in\nthis case is alleged to have occurred on the territory of a foreign sovereign.\n\n                                                              22\n\ffederal courts to recognize certain causes of action,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1664. In order “to rebut\n\nthe presumption, the ATS [i.e., the statute] would need to evince a clear indication of\n\nextraterritoriality.” Id. at 1665 (quotation marks omitted)). Applying this approach in Kiobel, the\n\nSupreme Court held as a matter of statutory interpretation that the implicit authority to engage in\n\ncommon-law development under the ATS does not include the power to recognize causes of action\n\nbased solely on conduct occurring within the territory of another sovereign.27 In all cases, therefore\n\nthe ATS does not permit claims based on illegal conduct that occurred entirely in the territory of\n\nanother sovereign. In other words, a common-law cause of action brought under the ATS cannot\n\nhave extraterritorial reach simply because some judges, in some cases, conclude that it should.\n\n                                                              c.\n\n         Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants “took affirmative steps in this country to\n\ncircumvent the sanctions regime, though discovery would be necessary to determine the full scope\n\nof such U.S.-based conduct.” Plaintiffs’ Letter Br. 13. Without additional explanation, the plaintiffs\n\nrefer to various paragraphs in the complaints asserting that the American defendants continued to\n\nsupply the South African government with their products, notwithstanding various legal restrictions\n\nagainst trade with South Africa. See Balintulo Compl. ¶¶ 246–50 (Ford), App’x 494–95; id. ¶¶ 196,\n\n198, 212 (IBM), App’x 483, 486; Ntsebeza Compl. ¶ 128 (Ford), App’x 199; id. ¶¶ 139–41 (IBM),\n\nApp’x 202–03.\n\n         None of these paragraphs, however, ties the relevant human rights violations to actions\n\ntaken within the United States. The complaint alleges only vicarious liability of the defendant\n\n     27 See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1665 (“[N]othing in the text of the statute suggests . . . extraterritorial reach.” (emphasis\n\nsupplied)); id. at 1666 (“[N]othing in the text of the ATS evinces the requisite clear indication of extraterritoriality.”\n(emphasis supplied)); id. at 1669 (“[T]he presumption against extraterritoriality applies to claims under the ATS, and . . .\nnothing in the statute rebuts that presumption.” (emphasis supplied)). Concurring only in the judgment, Justice Breyer\nseems to have understood the Court’s opinion as leaving open whether the ATS can provide jurisdiction over “a statutory\nclaim”—as opposed to whether federal courts should recognize “common-law causes of action” under the ATS—where\nCongress evinces sufficient intent to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. Id. at 1673 (Breyer, J.,\nconcurring) (emphasis supplied).\n\n                                                              23\n\fcorporations based on the actions taken within South Africa by their South African subsidiaries. See\n\nIn re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F. Supp. 2d 228, 275 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“[A]llegations [of an\n\nagency relationship] are sufficiently plausible to allow this claim to proceed on a theory of vicarious\n\nliability.”). Because the defendants’ putative agents did not commit any relevant conduct within the\n\nUnited States giving rise to a violation of customary international law—that is, because the asserted\n\n“violation[s] of the law of nations occurr[ed] outside the United States,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669—\n\nthe defendants cannot be vicariously liable for that conduct under the ATS.28\n\n         In sum, the Supreme Court’s holding in Kiobel plainly bars the plaintiffs’ claims, and the\n\ndefendants will therefore be able to obtain relief in the District Court by moving for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings. Accordingly, mandamus relief is denied.\n\n                                            B. Collateral Order Doctrine\n\n         The defendants also assert that the district court’s order denying their motion to dismiss is a\n\n“collateral order,” subject to immediate appellate review. In contrast to the “discretionary review\n\nmechanisms” of certification and mandamus, Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 111, collateral order appeals\n\nare taken “as of right,” id. at 112, and do not depend on an “‘individualized jurisdictional inquiry,’”\n\nid. at 107 (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 473 (1978)). The parties have\n\npresented strong arguments on each side regarding the immediate appealability of the District\n\nCourt’s order under the collateral order doctrine,29 but we need not confront that question now.\n\n\n      28 To hold otherwise would conflate the extraterritoriality analysis—which asks where the “violation[ ] of the law of\n\nnations occur[red],” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669—with the question of derivative liability. See generally United States v.\nBestfoods, 524 U.S. 51, 64–65 (1998) (distinguishing “derivative liability cases . . . from those in which the alleged wrong\ncan seemingly be traced to the parent through the conduit of its own personnel and management and the parent is\ndirectly a participant in the wrong complained of” (internal quotation marks omitted)). This principle follows from the\nsettled rule that claims of derivative liability depend on the viability of the underlying claim. See, e.g., S.E.C. v. Obus, 693\nF.3d 276, 292 (2d Cir. 2012); Homoki v. Conversion Servs., Inc., 717 F.3d 388, 402 (5th Cir. 2013); Rivera v. Centro Medico de\nTurabo, Inc., 575 F.3d 10, 24 (1st Cir. 2009); David P. Coldesina, D.D.S. v. Estate of Simper, 407 F.3d 1126, 1138 (10th Cir.\n2005). Of course, we need not address at this time whether derivative liability is a valid theory of liability in suits\nbrought under the ATS.\n     The plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine because the defendants’\n    29\n\narguments based on deference to foreign policy concerns are not equivalent to assertions of immunity from suit. See\n\n                                                               24\n\fThe Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel, among other developments in ATS jurisprudence during the\n\npast four years, plainly forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of law. See Part II.A.ii, ante.\n\n         In these circumstances, the interests of judicial economy, and of the parties, are best served\n\nby holding this putative appeal under the collateral order doctrine in abeyance and enabling the\n\nDistrict Court to consider a motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss the plaintiffs’\n\nremaining claims.30 See, e.g., Authors Guild, Inc. v. Google Inc., --- F.3d ----, 2013 WL 3286232 (2d Cir.\n\nJuly 1, 2013); In re Sims, 534 F.3d at 127. The parties can then inform this Court, when appropriate,\n\nthat this matter has been rendered moot.\n\n                                                    CONCLUSION\n\n         To summarize:\n\n         1. Before issuing a writ of mandamus, a court must ensure that (1) the party seeking relief\n\n              has no other adequate means of relief; (2) his right to issuance of the writ is clear; and\n\n              (3) circumstances justify use of the writ.\n\n         2. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 133 S. Ct.\n\n              1659 (2013), issuance of the writ is unnecessary in this case because the defendants have\n\n              an adequate means of relief through a motion for judgment on the pleadings. That is,\n\n              regardless of the merits of their various arguments in favor of case-specific deference\n\n              and international comity, the defendants can obtain the dismissal of all claims now that\n\n\n\nAbelesz v. OTP Bank, 692 F.3d 638, 649–50 (7th Cir. 2012); Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 473 F.3d 345, 349–51 (D.C. Cir.\n2007). The defendants, however, argue that collateral review is not limited to assertions of immunity from suit but also\napplies when “delaying review until the entry of final judgment ‘would imperil a substantial public interest’ or ‘some\nparticular value of a high order.’” Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 107 (quoting Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 352–53 (2006)).\n\n    30   It is the frequent practice of this Court to remand a case for a limited purpose while an appeal is held in abeyance.\nSee, e.g., Hayden v. Pataki, 449 F.3d 305, 371 (2d Cir. 2006) (en banc) (citing United States v. Jacobson, 15 F.3d 19, 21–22 (2d\nCir. 1994)). In effect, we adopt that course here. Nonetheless, we do not formally “remand” the cause, because, having\nnot yet recognized jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, we presume that the District Court “ha[s] jurisdiction\nto continue with the case in the absence of a stay from this Court” pending resolution of the appeal. Motorola Credit Corp.\nv. Uzan, 388 F.3d 39, 53 (2d Cir. 2004). Accordingly, with the stay on the proceedings in the District Court vacated, we\nperceive no need to remand the cause or issue a formal mandate.\n\n                                                              25\n\f            the Supreme Court in Kiobel has made clear that federal courts may not, under the ATS,\n\n            recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in another country.\n\n        3. The plaintiffs’ arguments that the Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel does not apply\n\n            where the defendants are American citizens, or where the case involves American\n\n            interests, are without merit.\n\n        4. Because the Supreme Court’s Kiobel decision plainly forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims as a\n\n            matter of law, we do not consider whether the defendants have asserted a valid basis for\n\n            “collateral order” jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n        Because the Kiobel decision, combined with the opportunity to move for dismissal in the\n\nDistrict Court, provides an adequate ground for dismissing all remaining claims, the defendants’\n\npetition for a writ of mandamus is DENIED. The stay placed by this Court on proceedings in the\n\nDistrict Court is hereby VACATED. Proceedings in the District Court may resume forthwith. See\n\nnote 30, ante. We reserve the question whether we have jurisdiction under the collateral order\n\ndoctrine and hold this putative appeal in abeyance pending further notice from the parties, provided\n\nin writing to the Clerk of this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f",

Scheindlin, Judge) to resolve in the\n\ndefendants’ favor these proposed class-action suits brought under the Alien Tort Statute (“ATS”),\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1350, on behalf of those harmed by the decades-long South African legal regime known\n\nas “apartheid.” The plaintiffs seek damages for violations of customary international law committed\n\nby the South African government, allegedly aided and abetted by the South African subsidiary\n\ncompanies of the named corporate defendants—Daimler, Ford, and IBM. In short, the plaintiffs\n\nclaim that these subsidiary companies sold cars and computers to the South African government,\n\nthus making the defendants, their parent companies, liable for the apartheid regime’s innumerable\n\nrace-based depredations and injustices, including rape, torture, and extrajudicial killings.\n\n        Although the plaintiffs did not claim that any of the South African government’s alleged\n\nviolations of the law of nations occurred in the United States, at the time they filed their complaint\n\nthey assumed (as did most American courts) that no such geographical connection was necessary.\n\nBased on the same assumption, the District Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss, which\n\nhad asserted various grounds for dismissal, including that claims brought under the ATS cannot be\n\nbased on “extraterritorial” conduct—i.e., conduct that occurred in the territory of a sovereign other\n\nthan the United States. The District Court denied a motion to certify an interlocutory appeal, and\n\nthe defendants thereupon sought immediate appellate review through a writ of mandamus and by\n\ninvocation of the “collateral order” doctrine.\n\n        This putative appeal, held in abeyance pending a decision by the Supreme Court that was not\n\nissued until 2013, and now pending for four years, involves challenging and important questions\n\nregarding the immediate appealability of certain orders in cases brought under the Alien Tort\n\nStatute, where the United States government has informed the district court that the ongoing\n\n\n                                                    2\n\flitigation substantially threatens American foreign policy. We no longer need to answer those\n\nquestions, however, because all of the underlying claims are plainly barred by the recent opinion of\n\nthe Supreme Court in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"858289\"><a href=\"/opinion/858289/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. at 1668–69. Because that decision provides a\n\nsufficient ground for dismissing all of the remaining claims, we deny mandamus relief. For the same\n\nreason, we conclude that the interests of judicial economy, and of the parties, are best served by\n\nholding this putative appeal in abeyance and enabling the District Court to consider a motion to\n\ndismiss the plaintiffs’ remaining claims.

The Ntsebeza plaintiffs additionally\n          allege that defendant IBM—or its agents or alter egos—committed secondary\n          violations of the law of nations by providing the computer hardware, software,\n          maintenance, and support necessary for the South African Government to carry out\n          geographic segregation and denationalization. . . .\n              The Khulumani plaintiffs allege that the automotive defendants aided and abetted\n          violations of the law of nations by supplying vehicles, parts, and other equipment to\n          the apartheid security forces. The Khulumani plaintiffs additionally allege that the\n          technology defendants aided and abetted violations of the law of nations by\n          providing the computer systems necessary to restrict black South Africans’\n          movements, track dissidents, and target particular individuals for repressive acts.\n\nIn re South African Apartheid Litig., 617 F.

The defendants,\nhowever, also argue that our decision in Presbyterian Church—which adopted a rule proposed by Judge Katzmann’s\nconcurring opinion in Khulumani as the law of the Circuit, see 582 F.3d at 258—addresses only the threshold question\nwhether, and by what mens rea standard, a court has subject-matter jurisdiction under the ATS for aiding-and-abetting liability,\nleaving open the secondary question whether federal courts should “decline to provide a cause of action,” as a matter of\nfederal common law, for accessorial liability.

Three conditions circumscribe use of the writ:\n\n         First, the party seeking issuance of the writ must have no other adequate means to\n         attain the relief he desires—a condition designed to ensure that the writ will not be\n         used as a substitute for the regular appeals process. Second, the petitioner must\n         satisfy the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear and\n         indisputable. Third, even if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing\n         court, in the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate\n         under the circumstances.\n\nCheney, 542 U.S. at 380–81 (alternations, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted).\n\nMandamus relief is appropriate “in extraordinary circumstances,” when, for example, a district\n\ncourt’s order “amounts to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion, or otherwise\n\nworks a manifest injustice.” Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 111 (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).18\n\n\n    17  “Permissive interlocutory appeal,” a leading treatise observes, “can reduce the need to develop extraordinary-writ\npractice to fill the inevitable gaps in provisions for appeal as a matter of right.” 16 Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3929.1 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n    18 It is important to note, however, that mandamus relief does not impeach a judge’s competence and “is not a\npunitive remedy.” Will, 389 U.S. at 107; see also In re Chambers Dev.

First, ATS suits often create particular “risks of adverse foreign\n\npolicy consequences,” Sosa, 542 U.S. at 728, obliging courts to be “particularly wary of impinging on\n\nthe discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs,” id. at 727.\n\nThis risk of treading into matters within the province of other branches of government, and\n\nintruding into delicate areas of intergovernmental relations, warrants closer appellate scrutiny\n\nthrough supervisory mandamus review. See Cheney, 542 U.S. at 380–82. Appellate courts have\n\ntherefore been less hesitant to issue the writ when a lower-court decision threatens to affect the\n\nforeign policy of the United States. See, e.g., Ex parte Republic of Peru, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103805\"><a href=\"/opinion/103805/ex-parte-peru/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586 (1943); In re\n\nAustrian, German Holocaust Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773261\"><a href=\"/opinion/773261/in-re-austrian-and-german-holocaust-litigation-henry-duveen-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163–65 (2d Cir. 2001); Abelesz v.

Second, and relatedly, the ATS places federal judges in an unusual\n\nlawmaking role as creators of federal common law. See Sosa, 542 U.S. at 724–25.

Such important foreign policy interests as those raised here cannot be vindicated by\n\nwaiting until final judgment.\n\n        Nonetheless, we need not wade into the merits of the defendants’ various arguments,\n\nbecause we are not persuaded that mandamus is the only “adequate means to attain the relief” that\n\nthey desire. For the reasons explained in the following section, see Part II.A.ii., and in light of the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding in Kiobel that federal courts may not, under the ATS, recognize common-\n\nlaw causes of action for conduct occurring in the territory of another sovereign, Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at\n\n1668–69, defendants can seek the dismissal of all of the plaintiffs’ claims, and prevail, prior to\n\ndiscovery, through a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of\n\n\n\n\n    19 During oral argument on January 11, 2010, the government confirmed that this statement has not been modified\n\nor withdrawn.\n\n                                                        18\n\fCivil Procedure.20 Mandamus with respect to any of the defendants’ various claims of error is,\n\ntherefore, simply unnecessary in light of the Supreme Court’s clear guidance that claims based on\n\nconduct occurring solely abroad cannot be adjudicated under the ATS.21\n\n                                                               ii.\n\n          As we have now made clear, Kiobel forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims because the plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to allege that any relevant conduct occurred in the United States. The plaintiffs resist this\n\nobvious impact of the Kiobel holding on their claims. The Supreme Court’s decision, they argue,\n\ndoes not preclude suits under the ATS based on foreign conduct when the defendants are American\n\nnationals, or where the defendants’ conduct affronts significant American interests identified by the\n\nplaintiffs. See Plaintiffs’ Letter Br. at 6–13. Curiously, this interpretation of Kiobel arrives at precisely\n\nthe conclusion reached by Justice Breyer, who, writing for himself and three colleagues, only\n\nconcurred in the judgment of the Court affirming our decision to dismiss all remaining claims\n\nbrought under the ATS. See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1671 (Breyer, J., concurring). The plaintiffs’\n\nargument, however, seeks to evade the bright-line clarity of the Court’s actual holding—clarity that\n\nensures that the defendants can obtain their desired relief without resort to mandamus. We briefly\n\nhighlight why the plaintiffs’ arguments lack merit.\n\n\n\n\n     20 We note that Daimler, Ford, and IBM filed answers in the District Court on June 22, 2009, thus generally barring\n\nthe filing of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).

Ct. at 1669). The plaintiffs read the opinion of\n\nthe Court as holding only that “mere corporate presence” in the United States is insufficient for a\n\nclaim to “touch and concern” the United States, but that corporate citizenship in the United States is\n\nenough. Id. at 11 (“[I]nternational law violations committed by U.S. citizens on foreign soil ‘touch\n\nand concern’ U.S. territory with ‘sufficient force’ to displace the Kiobel presumption.”). Reaching a\n\nconclusion similar to that of Justice Breyer and the minority of the Supreme Court in Kiobel, the\n\nplaintiffs argue that whether the relevant conduct occurred abroad is simply one prong of a multi-\n\nfactor test, and the ATS still reaches extraterritorial conduct when the defendant is an American\n\nnational. Id. at 8–11.\n\n         We disagree. The Supreme Court expressly held that claims under the ATS cannot be\n\nbrought for violations of the law of nations occurring within the territory of a sovereign other than\n\nthe United States. Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1662, 1668–69. The majority framed the question presented\n\nin these terms no fewer than three times22; it repeated the same language, focusing solely on the\n\nlocation of the relevant “conduct” or “violation,” at least eight more times in other parts of its eight-\n\npage opinion23; and it affirmed our judgment dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims because “all the\n\n\n      22 See Kiobel, 133 S.

Ct. at 1668.\nAccordingly, the Court did not suggest that a defendant’s citizenship has any relevance to the presumption against\nextraterritoriality, and it instead stated over and over that the ATS bars suits where the relevant conduct occurs abroad.\nSee notes 22 & 23, ante.\n     25 Part IV, which followed the Supreme Court’s conclusion in Part III that “petitioner’s case seeking relief for\n\nviolations of the law of nations occurring outside the United States is barred,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669, reads as follows:\n          On these facts, all the relevant conduct took place outside the United States. And even where the\n          claims touch and concern the territory of the United States, they must do so with sufficient force to\n          displace the presumption against extraterritorial application. See Morrison, 130 S. Ct. at 2883–88.\n          Corporations are often present in many countries, and it would reach too far to say that mere\n          corporate presence suffices. If Congress were to determine otherwise, a statute more specific than the\n          ATS would be required.\nId. Viewing this paragraph in context, the first sentence relates to this case, and the second sentence relates to ATS cases\nnot already “barred” because all of the relevant conduct occurred abroad. This dichotomy is evident from (1) the\ncontrast between the opening clauses in these two sentences; (2) the Court’s earlier conclusion that “petitioner’s case . . .\nis barred” based solely on the extraterritoriality of the relevant conduct, without consideration of whether other aspects\nof the claim might “touch and concern” the United States; and (3) the Court’s use of the general phrase “they must do\nso,” rather than a case-specific phrase, such as “they do not do so.” Consistent with this view, the reference to\ncorporate presence indicates that mere corporate presence in the United States is not “relevant conduct” when deciding\nwhether an ATS claim avoids the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n\n                                                              21\n\fat 1669 (citing Morrison v.

But since all the relevant conduct in Kiobel occurred outside the United States—a\n\ndispositive fact in light of the Supreme Court’s holding—the Court had no reason to explore, much\n\nless explain, how courts should proceed when some of the relevant conduct occurs in the United\n\nStates.26\n\n                                                              b.\n\n         The plaintiffs also assert that “the Kiobel presumption is displaced here” because of the\n\ncompelling American interests in supporting the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.\n\nPlaintiffs’ Letter Br. 11.

Its “wisdom,” the Supreme Court has explained, is that, “[r]ather than guess anew\n\nin each case, we apply the presumption in all cases, preserving a stable background against which\n\nCongress can legislate with predictable effects.” Id. at 2881 (emphasis supplied). For that reason,\n\nthe presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the statute, or at least the part of the ATS that\n\n“carries with it an opportunity to develop common law,” Sosa, 542 U.S. at 731 n.19, and “allows\n\n\n\n    26  Although joining in the opinion of the Court, Justice Alito, joined by Justice Thomas, indicated a desire to adopt a\nbroader holding, requiring that the “domestic conduct” be “sufficient” to constitute a violation of an appropriate\ninternational law norm. Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1670 (Alito, J., concurring). The Court did not adopt Justice Alito’s broader\nreasoning, but it did not reject it either; the majority simply left open any questions regarding the permissible reach of\ncauses of action under the ATS when “some domestic activity is involved in the case.” Morrison, 130 S.

See Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1665.

Applying this approach in Kiobel, the\n\nSupreme Court held as a matter of statutory interpretation that the implicit authority to engage in\n\ncommon-law development under the ATS does not include the power to recognize causes of action\n\nbased solely on conduct occurring within the territory of another sovereign.27 In all cases, therefore\n\nthe ATS does not permit claims based on illegal conduct that occurred entirely in the territory of\n\nanother sovereign. In other words, a common-law cause of action brought under the ATS cannot\n\nhave extraterritorial reach simply because some judges, in some cases, conclude that it should.\n\n                                                              c.\n\n         Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the defendants “took affirmative steps in this country to\n\ncircumvent the sanctions regime, though discovery would be necessary to determine the full scope\n\nof such U.S.-based conduct.” Plaintiffs’ Letter Br. 13.

Because the defendants’ putative agents did not commit any relevant conduct within the\n\nUnited States giving rise to a violation of customary international law—that is, because the asserted\n\n“violation[s] of the law of nations occurr[ed] outside the United States,” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669—\n\nthe defendants cannot be vicariously liable for that conduct under the ATS.28\n\n         In sum, the Supreme Court’s holding in Kiobel plainly bars the plaintiffs’ claims, and the\n\ndefendants will therefore be able to obtain relief in the District Court by moving for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings. Accordingly, mandamus relief is denied.\n\n                                            B. Collateral Order Doctrine\n\n         The defendants also assert that the district court’s order denying their motion to dismiss is a\n\n“collateral order,” subject to immediate appellate review. In contrast to the “discretionary review\n\nmechanisms” of certification and mandamus, Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 111, collateral order appeals\n\nare taken “as of right,” id. at 112, and do not depend on an “‘individualized jurisdictional inquiry,’”\n\nid. at 107 (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v.

The parties have\n\npresented strong arguments on each side regarding the immediate appealability of the District\n\nCourt’s order under the collateral order doctrine,29 but we need not confront that question now.\n\n\n      28 To hold otherwise would conflate the extraterritoriality analysis—which asks where the “violation[ ] of the law of\n\nnations occur[red],” Kiobel, 133 S. Ct. at 1669—with the question of derivative liability. See generally United States v.\nBestfoods, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118219\"><a href=\"/opinion/118219/united-states-v-bestfoods/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64–65 (1998) (distinguishing “derivative liability cases . . . from those in which the alleged wrong\ncan seemingly be traced to the parent through the conduit of its own personnel and management and the parent is\ndirectly a participant in the wrong complained of” (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Of course, we need not address at this time whether derivative liability is a valid theory of liability in suits\nbrought under the ATS.\n     The plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine because the defendants’\n    29\n\narguments based on deference to foreign policy concerns are not equivalent to assertions of immunity from suit. See\n\n                                                               24\n\fThe Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel, among other developments in ATS jurisprudence during the\n\npast four years, plainly forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims as a matter of law. See Part II.A.ii, ante.\n\n         In these circumstances, the interests of judicial economy, and of the parties, are best served\n\nby holding this putative appeal under the collateral order doctrine in abeyance and enabling the\n\nDistrict Court to consider a motion for judgment on the pleadings to dismiss the plaintiffs’\n\nremaining claims.30 See, e.g., Authors Guild, Inc. v.

Before issuing a writ of mandamus, a court must ensure that (1) the party seeking relief\n\n              has no other adequate means of relief; (2) his right to issuance of the writ is clear; and\n\n              (3) circumstances justify use of the writ.\n\n         2. In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"858289\"><a href=\"/opinion/858289/kiobel-v-royal-dutch-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That is,\n\n              regardless of the merits of their various arguments in favor of case-specific deference\n\n              and international comity, the defendants can obtain the dismissal of all claims now that\n\n\n\nAbelesz v.

The defendants, however, argue that collateral review is not limited to assertions of immunity from suit but also\napplies when “delaying review until the entry of final judgment ‘would imperil a substantial public interest’ or ‘some\nparticular value of a high order.’” Mohawk Indus., 558 U.S. at 107 (quoting Will v. Hallock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145689\"><a href=\"/opinion/145689/will-v-hallock/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">345</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352–53 (2006)).\n\n    30   It is the frequent practice of this Court to remand a case for a limited purpose while an appeal is held in abeyance.\nSee, e.g., Hayden v. Pataki, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794467\"><a href=\"/opinion/794467/joseph-hayden-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-individuals-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (2d Cir. 2006) (en banc) (citing United States v.

In effect, we adopt that course here. Nonetheless, we do not formally “remand” the cause, because, having\nnot yet recognized jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, we presume that the District Court “ha[s] jurisdiction\nto continue with the case in the absence of a stay from this Court” pending resolution of the appeal. Motorola Credit Corp.\nv.

Accordingly, with the stay on the proceedings in the District Court vacated, we\nperceive no need to remand the cause or issue a formal mandate.\n\n                                                              25\n\f            the Supreme Court in Kiobel has made clear that federal courts may not, under the ATS,\n\n            recognize common-law causes of action for conduct occurring in another country.\n\n        3. The plaintiffs’ arguments that the Supreme Court’s decision in Kiobel does not apply\n\n            where the defendants are American citizens, or where the case involves American\n\n            interests, are without merit.\n\n        4. Because the Supreme Court’s Kiobel decision plainly forecloses the plaintiffs’ claims as a\n\n            matter of law, we do not consider whether the defendants have asserted a valid basis for\n\n            “collateral order” jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n        Because the Kiobel decision, combined with the opportunity to move for dismissal in the\n\nDistrict Court, provides an adequate ground for dismissing all remaining claims, the defendants’\n\npetition for a writ of mandamus is DENIED. The stay placed by this Court on proceedings in the\n\nDistrict Court is hereby VACATED. Proceedings in the District Court may resume forthwith. See\n\nnote 30, ante. We reserve the question whether we have jurisdiction under the collateral order\n\ndoctrine and hold this putative appeal in abeyance pending further notice from the parties, provided\n\nin writing to the Clerk of this Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  26\n\f</pre>",
