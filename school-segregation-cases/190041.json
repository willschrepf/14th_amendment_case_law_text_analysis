ROBINSON,\n\n                                         Defendant-Appellant.\n\n         ______________________________________________\n\n      Appeal from the United States District Court for the\n                   Northern District of Texas\n         ______________________________________________\n                         August 8, 1997\n\nBefore WISDOM, BENAVIDES, and STEWART, Circuit Judges.\n\nBENAVIDES, Circuit Judge:\n\n     The principal issues in this direct criminal appeal are\n\nwhether the Hobbs Act is a constitutional exercise of Congress’s\n\npower to regulate interstate commerce; and if so, whether the Act\n\nis constitutional as applied to a defendant whose conduct, viewed\n\nin isolation, does not substantially affect interstate commerce.\n\n     The Hobbs Act makes it a federal offense to impede interstate\n\ncommerce through robbery or extortion.    The appellant, relying on\n\nUnited States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d\n\n626 (1995), contends that the Act is unconstitutional because it\n\nauthorizes conviction of a defendant whose conduct affects commerce\n\n“in any way or degree.”     By contrast, Lopez identified specific\n\fcircumstances     in     which     federal         statutes,     to     withstand\n\nconstitutional     scrutiny,       must      affect      interstate      commerce\n\nsubstantially.\n\n     Applying the lessons of Lopez, we hold that the Hobbs Act is\n\na permissible exercise of the congressional power to regulate\n\ncommerce among the states.        Our holding aligns us with every other\n\ncircuit that has addressed the issue.1               We further hold that in\n\nHobbs Act prosecutions based on local activities that affect\n\ninterstate commerce, the government need not prove that the effect\n\nof an individual defendant’s conduct was substantial.                 It suffices\n\nto show a slight effect in each case, provided that the defendant’s\n\nconduct is of a general type which, viewed in the aggregate,\n\naffects interstate commerce substantially.\n\n     Although we affirm appellant’s convictions, we vacate his\n\nsentence, which was erroneously enhanced on the ground that his\n\nvictims, Asian-American merchants, were unusually vulnerable.\n\n     I.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     In   the   spring   and     early    summer    of   1995,   several    small\n\nbusinesses in the Dallas area were victimized in a series of crimes\n\nthat became known as the “driveway bank robberies.”                   The victims\n\nwere owners and employees of liquor stores, convenience stores, and\n\n      1\n       See United States v. Harrington, 108 F.3d 1460 (D.C. Cir.\n1997); United States v. Atcheson, 94 F.3d 1237 (9th Cir. 1996),\ncert. denied, ---U.S.---, 117 S.Ct. 1096, 137 L.Ed.2d 229 (1997);\nUnited States v. Farmer, 73 F.3d 836, 843 (8th Cir.), cert. denied,\n---U.S.---, 116 S.Ct. 2570, 135 L.Ed.2d 1086 (1996); United States\nv. Stillo, 57 F.3d 553, 558 n.2 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, ---U.S.--\n-, 116 S.Ct. 383, 133 L.Ed.2d 306 (1995); United States v. Bolton,\n68 F.3d 396 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, ---U.S.---, 116 S.Ct.\n966, 133 L.Ed.2d 887 (1996).\n\n                                         2\n\fother retail and service establishments.                            The stores provided\n\ncheck-cashing services; the record reflects that the stores cashed\n\nout-of-state checks, payroll checks, and government benefit checks.\n\nThe record also reflects that several of the stores sold products\n\nthat had been shipped to Texas from other states.                                The victims\n\ntestified that they suffered substantial business losses as a\n\nresult of the robberies; one store was forced to close permanently\n\nfor lack of capital, and the others were unable to cash checks for\n\na finite period of time.\n\n       The   robberies         were    carried          out    through       a    relatively\n\nsophisticated         technique       known       as     “jugging,”         in   which      the\n\nperpetrators      reconnoitered        the        stores,      learned      their    business\n\nroutines,       and   struck    immediately            after    the    victims      had    made\n\nsubstantial bank withdrawals for use in cashing their customers’\n\nchecks.      Typically the robberies took place in the commercial\n\ndrive-up lane of the bank or in the parking lot of the store as the\n\nowner or employee returned with a cash withdrawal.\n\n       An investigation by a violent crimes task force comprising FBI\n\nagents    and    Dallas    police      officers         led    to     the   arrest    of    the\n\nprincipal suspect, Ernest Thompson, on July 1, 1995. Arrested with\n\nThompson was the appellant, Anthony W. Robinson, who subsequently\n\nmade    several       self-incriminating            statements         to   investigators.\n\nThompson     eventually        pleaded        guilty        and     testified        for    the\n\nprosecution at Robinson’s trial. A money-laundering charge against\n\na third defendant was dropped.\n\n       Robinson was indicted on charges of conspiring to violate the\n\n\n                                              3\n\fHobbs Act and aiding and abetting three robberies in violation of\n\nthe Act.    18 U.S.C. §§ 1951(a), 2.     The victims testified at trial\n\nthat these robberies caused business losses of approximately $5,000\n\neach to Maple Convenience Store and West End Liquors, and $60,000\n\nto S&S Foods.      Each Hobbs Act robbery count was accompanied by a\n\ncount alleging that Robinson aided and abetted the possession of a\n\nfirearm during a crime of violence.           18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c)(1), 2.\n\nTwo of the three firearm counts were dismissed by the district\n\ncourt.     Before trial, the government dismissed a separate count\n\ncharging Robinson as principal in a fourth Hobbs Act robbery.\n\n     After a jury trial, Robinson was convicted on the remaining\n\ncounts: Hobbs Act conspiracy, aiding and abetting three Hobbs Act\n\nrobberies, and aiding and abetting one firearm violation.            He was\n\nsentenced to a prison term of 210 months on the Hobbs Act counts\n\nand a consecutive 60-month term on the firearm count.             He appeals\n\nhis convictions and his sentence.\n\n     II. CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE HOBBS ACT CONVICTIONS\n\n     A.     Introduction: First Principles\n\n     We are mindful of the “first principles” articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Lopez: that the national government is one of\n\nenumerated powers, and that the division of authority between the\n\nnational government and the states is intended to preserve the\n\nliberties of the people.       514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1626.\n\nLopez vividly reminds us that from time to time, the judiciary must\n\nintercede     to   assure   that   Congress    does   not,   by    enacting\n\nunconstitutional legislation under the guise of the commerce power,\n\n\n                                     4\n\fdramatically alter the balance of federalism.              We are also well\n\naware of the arguments against shifting the primary responsibility\n\nfor enacting and enforcing the criminal law from the states to the\n\ncentral government.\n\n     At the same time, we recognize the broad sweep of Congress’s\n\nconstitutional authority “[t]o regulate [c]ommerce . . . among the\n\nseveral    [s]tates,”   and   its    concomitant   power    to    protect   the\n\nnation’s commerce by enacting such laws as it deems “necessary and\n\nproper.”    U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, 18; see also Katzenbach v.\n\nMcClung, 379 U.S. 294, 301-02, 85 S.Ct. 377, 382, 13 L.Ed.2d 290\n\n(1964).    The Commerce Clause has long been recognized as “one of\n\nthe most prolific sources of national power,” H.P. Hood & Sons,\n\nInc. v. Du Mond, 336 U.S. 525, 534-35, 69 S.Ct. 657, 93 L.Ed. 865\n\n(1949),    if   not   the   single   greatest   source     of    congressional\n\nregulatory authority.       See LAURENCE H. TRIBE, AMERICAN CONSTITUTIONAL LAW\n\n§ 5-4 (2d ed. 1988). Chief Justice Marshall early recognized “that\n\nthe Commerce Clause grants Congress extensive power and ample\n\ndiscretion to determine its appropriate exercise.” Lopez, 514 U.S.\n\nat ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1634 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (citing Gibbons\n\nv. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 194, 196, 22 U.S. 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824)).              The\n\nexercise of this power over the past century has helped bind the\n\ndisparate states of the union into a single economic whole whose\n\nproductivity is unsurpassed in world history.\n\n     Against this backdrop, we do not read Lopez as counseling a\n\n\n\n\n                                       5\n\freturn to a “horse-and-buggy definition of interstate commerce.”2\n\nAs Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice O’Connor, pointed out in his\n\nLopez concurrence:\n\n     The history of the judicial struggle to interpret the\n     Commerce Clause during the transition from the economic\n     system the Founders knew to the single, national market\n     still emergent in our era counsels great restraint before\n     the Court determines that the Clause is insufficient to\n     support an exercise of national power.\n\nLopez,    514    U.S.     at   ---,   115     S.Ct.   at    1634   (Kennedy,   J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n     As Justices Kennedy and O’Connor recognized, our federal\n\nstructure exists in more than one dimension.                 The courts must be\n\nvigilant to prevent Congress from asserting powers not delegated to\n\nthe national government by the Constitution, but must themselves\n\navoid usurping the national legislature’s policy-making role in the\n\ncommercial      sphere.        As   the   next    section    makes   clear,    the\n\nConstitution’s delegation to Congress of the power to regulate the\n\nnation’s commercial life commands a significant degree of judicial\n\ndeference.\n\n     B.    Standard of Review and Level of Scrutiny\n\n     We exercise plenary review of the district court’s legal\n\nconclusion that the Hobbs Act is constitutional, and we review the\n\nstatute itself under the deferential “rational basis” standard.\n\nThe latter point bears emphasis.              In the wake of Lopez, courts are\n\n\n     2\n      Kathleen F. Brickey, Crime Control and the Commerce Clause:\nLife after Lopez, 46 CASE W. L. REV. 801, 803 (1996) (quoting\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, press conference (May 31, 1935), in 4 The\nPublic Papers and Addresses of Franklin D. Roosevelt, 200, 221\n(Samuel I. Rosenman ed., 1938)).\n\n                                          6\n\fless likely to take congressional invocations of the commerce power\n\nat face value, at least when the regulated activity’s relation to\n\ninterstate commerce is “[in]visible to the naked eye . . . .”\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1632.               In that sense, we read\n\nLopez   as    an   admonition      that   rational      basis   scrutiny   is   not\n\ntantamount to an abdication of the judiciary’s responsibility “to\n\nsay what the law is.”        Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch. 137, 177, 5\n\nU.S. 137, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), cited in Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115\n\nS.Ct. at 1633.       “[D]eference is not acquiescence . . . .”             United\n\nStates v. Knutson, 113 F.3d 27, 29 (5th Cir. 1997) (per curiam).\n\n     However, nothing in Lopez suggests that the Supreme Court has\n\nreplaced the rational basis test with a more exacting standard. To\n\nthe contrary:\n\n     [T]he Court made clear that federal Commerce Clause\n     legislation continues to merit a high degree of judicial\n     deference,    and    that    courts    considering    the\n     constitutionality of such legislation should apply only\n     ‘rational basis’ review. Accordingly, we must limit our\n     inquiry to a determination whether Congress could have\n     had a rational basis to conclude that its enactment of\n     [the statute] was a valid exercise of its commerce power.\n\nId. (footnotes and internal citations omitted; emphasis added).\n\n     We are thus bound to uphold the Hobbs Act if Congress could\n\nhave had a rational basis for concluding that its enactment was\n\nvalid under the Commerce Clause.              The Lopez Court catalogued three\n\nprincipal     ways    in   which    Congress      may    validly   exercise     its\n\nconstitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.                      Before\n\nconsidering the Hobbs Act itself, we turn to the Lopez decision and\n\nits taxonomy of the commerce power.\n\n     C.      Lopez and the Three Categories of Commercial Legislation\n\n                                          7\n\f     The statute at issue in Lopez was the Gun-Free School Zones\n\nAct of 1990, 18 U.S.C. § 922(q)(1)(A), which made it a federal\n\ncrime to possess a firearm in the vicinity of a school.                         Alfonso\n\nLopez, Jr., a twelfth-grade student at Edison High School in San\n\nAntonio, had been arrested for carrying a handgun and five bullets\n\nto school.    This court reversed his conviction for violating the\n\nGun-Free School Zones Act, and the Supreme Court affirmed, holding\n\nthat the statute was unsupported by the congressional power to\n\nregulate commerce.       United States v. Lopez, 2 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir.\n\n1993), aff’d, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624.\n\n     The Lopez Court described “three broad categories of activity”\n\nthat Congress may regulate under the commerce power.                      514 U.S. at\n\n---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.       “First, Congress may regulate the use of\n\nthe channels of interstate commerce.”               Id.    This category extends\n\nbeyond the regulation of highways, railroads, air routes, navigable\n\nrivers,    fiber-optic      cables     and    the    like.        Under     pre-Lopez\n\nprecedents,    Congress     may   legislate     “to       keep    the    channels    of\n\ninterstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses . . . .”\n\nId. (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379\n\nU.S. 241, 256, 85 S.Ct. 348, 357, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964) (internal\n\nquotation    marks   and    citation    omitted)).           This      branch   of   the\n\ncommerce    power    thus   provided     a    basis       for    the    civil   rights\n\nlegislation     prohibiting          racial     discrimination            in     public\n\naccommodations upheld in Heart of Atlanta Motel.                        This category\n\nalso is generally understood to encompass legislation aimed at\n\npreventing the misuse of the channels of commerce, such as statutes\n\n\n                                         8\n\fprohibiting interstate traffic in kidnapped persons, stolen goods,\n\nand prostitutes.      See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. §§ 1201, 2314, 2421.\n\n     The    second    category       comprises     “the   instrumentalities     of\n\ninterstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce.”\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.                  This branch of the\n\ncommerce    power     supports,       for    example,     federal      legislation\n\nprohibiting the destruction of aircraft and the theft of goods from\n\ninterstate shipments.         Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629\n\n(citing Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 150, 91 S.Ct. 1357,\n\n28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971)).\n\n     Finally, the commerce power “includes the power to regulate\n\nthose   activities    having     a    substantial     relation    to    interstate\n\ncommerce,     i.e.,   those     activities         that   substantially     affect\n\ninterstate commerce.”      Id. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30 (citations\n\nomitted).     Lopez squarely held that under this third category,\n\nfederal     legislation       concerning      an     intrastate     activity    is\n\npermissible    only    when     the    regulated      activity    “substantially\n\naffects” interstate commerce.            A “relatively trivial” effect on\n\ninterstate commerce cannot serve as a pretext for the “broad\n\ngeneral regulation of state or private activities.”                    Id. at 1630\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                    Nonetheless,\n\nactivities which at first blush appear to be local in character\n\nrepeatedly have been held subject to federal regulation because,\n\neither standing alone or cumulatively, they substantially affect\n\ninterstate commerce.          According to the Supreme Court, examples\n\ninclude coal mining, loan- sharking, the operation of racially\n\n\n                                         9\n\fsegregated      restaurants     and   hotels,   and   the   production   and\n\nconsumption of homegrown wheat.             Id. at 1630 (citing Hodel v.\n\nVirginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass’n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264,\n\n101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), Perez, McClung, Heart of\n\nAtlanta Motel, and Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82,\n\n87 L.Ed. 122 (1942)).3\n\n     In Lopez, the Supreme Court quickly dismissed the possibility\n\nthat the Gun-Free School Zones Act fell within either of the first\n\ntwo categories.      Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.          The\n\nCourt then analyzed the statute under the third category and found\n\nit constitutionally deficient for three reasons.            First, the Gun-\n\nFree School Zones Act had “nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any\n\nsort of economic activity, however broadly one might define those\n\nterms.”       Id. at 1630-31.    Because the possession of a gun near a\n\nschool has no demonstrable effect on commerce, Congress could not\n\nrationally have concluded that the proscribed conduct, “viewed in\n\nthe aggregate,” substantially affected interstate commerce. Id. at\n\n1631.     Second, the Gun-Free School Zones Act did not contain an\n\nexpress jurisdictional element which would have “ensure[d], through\n\ncase-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question\n\naffect[ed] interstate commerce.” Id. at 1631. Finally, there were\n\n\n          3\n        The Lopez opinion cited Heart of Atlanta Motel in its\ndiscussion of both the first and third categories. Compare 514\nU.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629 with id. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.\n     Recourse to the formal categories described in Lopez is\nunnecessary when an act of Congress directly regulates interstate\ncommerce or enterprises engaged in interstate commerce. See United\nStates v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669, 115 S.Ct. 1732, 131 L.Ed.2d 714\n(1995) (per curiam).\n\n                                       10\n\fneither legislative findings nor a legislative history illuminating\n\nhow Congress rationally could have determined that gun possession\n\nin    school   zones    substantially     affected    interstate     commerce.\n\nCongressional findings, though not strictly required, might have\n\nrevealed a constitutional basis for the legislation “even though no\n\n. . . substantial effect [upon interstate commerce] was visible to\n\nthe naked eye . . . .”       Id. at 1631-32.\n\n       We think Lopez makes clear that legislation concerning an\n\nintrastate activity will be upheld if Congress could rationally\n\nhave concluded that the activity, in isolation or in the aggregate,\n\nsubstantially affects interstate commerce.                This standard      will\n\nalmost certainly be met if a statutory jurisdictional element\n\nensures that an effect on interstate commerce must be proved in\n\neach case.     Even in the absence of such a statutory requirement, we\n\nwill uphold the challenged statute if the regulated conduct’s\n\nconnection to interstate commerce is manifest, i.e., “visible to\n\nthe naked eye.”      If we do not readily perceive a clear connection\n\nto interstate commerce, we may       nevertheless uphold the statute if\n\nthe nexus is satisfactorily explained by congressional findings or\n\nthe    legislative     history.     Conversely,      if    the   statute,     the\n\ncongressional findings, and the legislative history provide no\n\nrational basis for concluding that the regulated activity has the\n\nrequired nexus to interstate commerce, the statute must fall.\n\n       D.   The Hobbs Act\n\n       The Hobbs Act imposes criminal penalties on anyone who “in any\n\nway or      degree   obstructs,   delays,   or   affects     commerce   or    the\n\n\n                                     11\n\fmovement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or\n\nextortion[,] or attempts or conspires so to do . . . .”   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1951(a).    The statutory definition of “commerce” is co-extensive\n\nwith constitutional limits; the Act defines “commerce” to include\n\n“all commerce between any point in a State . . . and any point\n\noutside thereof; . . . and all other commerce over which the United\n\nStates has jurisdiction.”    18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(3).\n\n     There are thus two elements in a Hobbs Act prosecution: (1) a\n\nrobbery, act of extortion, or an attempt or conspiracy to rob or\n\nextort; and (2) an interference with interstate commerce.   Stirone\n\nv. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 274, 4 L.Ed.2d\n\n252 (1960).    It follows from the second element that an effect on\n\ncommerce must be proven in every case. However, the pre-Lopez case\n\nlaw firmly established that this so-called jurisdictional element\n\nis satisfied by a showing of a minimal effect on interstate\n\ncommerce.4    United States v. Box, 50 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir.)\n\n(internal citation omitted) (“slight” effect), cert. denied, ---\n\nU.S.---, 116 S.Ct. 309, 133 L.Ed.2d 213 (1995); United States v.\n\nCollins, 40 F.3d 95, 99 (5th Cir. 1994) (“de minimis” effect),\n\ncert. denied, ---U.S.---, 115 S.Ct. 1986, 131 L.Ed.2d 873 (1995).\n\nMoreover, a robbery or extortionate act that depletes the assets of\n\n      4\n      Courts use the phrase “jurisdictional” in this context as\nshorthand for the idea that absent a nexus to interstate commerce,\nthe federal government is not empowered to regulate. Of course,\nthe commercial nexus element in the Hobbs Act is not\n“jurisdictional” in the sense that a failure of proof would divest\nthe federal courts of adjudicatory power over the case.        The\ncommercial nexus requirement is in fact a substantive element of\nthe crime. With that caveat, we will follow the general usage by\nreferring to the Act’s commercial nexus element as jurisdictional.\n\n                                  12\n\fa commercial enterprise, impairing or delaying its ability to buy\n\ngoods     or   services     in    interstate      commerce,      satisfies    the\n\njurisdictional test.         See, e.g., Collins, 40 F.3d at 99; United\n\nStates v. Martinez, 28 F.3d 444, 445 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 513\n\nU.S. 910, 115 S.Ct. 281, 130 L.Ed.2d 197 (1994).\n\n     The Supreme Court long ago upheld the Hobbs Act against a\n\nCommerce Clause challenge, reasoning that the statute “is directed\n\nat the protection of interstate commerce . . . .”               United States v.\n\nGreen, 350 U.S. 415, 420, 76 S.Ct. 522, 526, 100 L.Ed. 494 (1956).\n\nThe question is whether the Act remains valid in light of its\n\nrequirement of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, or\n\nwhether Lopez requires a substantial effect.              As explained below,\n\nwe conclude that even if Lopez imposes a new requirement of\n\nsubstantiality, that requirement applies to the class of cases\n\nprosecuted in the aggregate; in any particular case, proof of a\n\nslight effect on interstate commerce suffices.\n\n     E.    Constitutionality of the Hobbs Act under Lopez\n\n     The Hobbs Act differs from the late Gun-Free School Zones Act\n\nin critical respects.        The Gun-Free School Zones Act concerned an\n\nactivity, gun possession in and near schools, which bore no evident\n\nrelation to interstate commerce.              In contrast, the nexus between\n\nrobbery and commerce is obvious: a successful robbery results in\n\nthe transfer of money or goods from the victim to the perpetrator.\n\nWhere,    as   in   this    case,    the      money   belongs    to   commercial\n\nestablishments engaged in interstate commercial transactions, the\n\nconnection     between     the   crime   and    interstate    commerce   is   not\n\n\n                                         13\n\fdifficult to discern.\n\n     In addition, the Hobbs Act includes an express jurisdictional\n\nelement of the sort conspicuously lacking in the Gun-Free School\n\nZones Act.   This requirement explicitly limits the scope of the\n\nHobbs Act to those robberies and extortion schemes which affect\n\ninterstate commerce.    Compare Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at\n\n1631 (faulting the Gun-Free School Zones Act for the absence of an\n\n“express jurisdictional requirement which might limit its reach to\n\na discrete set of firearm possessions that . . . have an explicit\n\nconnection with or effect on interstate commerce”).5\n\n     Appellant nonetheless invokes Lopez to challenge his Hobbs Act\n\nconvictions on several grounds.        Appellant’s terminology is none\n\ntoo precise, but we understand him to be making three distinct\n\narguments. First, he claims that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional\n\non its face because it allows convictions on evidence of less than\n\na substantial effect on interstate commerce.        Second, he argues\n\nthat the Act is unconstitutional as applied to a broad category of\n\ncases, including this one, involving local crimes whose effect on\n\ninterstate commerce is less than substantial.       Finally, he argues\n\nthat the indictment, evidence, and jury instructions were deficient\n\nbecause they did not adhere to the substantial effect requirement.\n\n      5\n      The Hobbs Act may also have a more compelling legislative\nhistory than did the Gun-Free School Zones Act. See Bolton, 68\nF.3d at 399 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 238, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.\n(1945), reprinted in 1946 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1360, 1370 (“[T]hose persons\nwho have been impeding interstate commerce . . . shall not be\npermitted to continue such practices without a sincere attempt on\nthe part of Congress to do its duty of protecting interstate\ncommerce.”)). However, we need not belabor the legislative record\nto decide this appeal.\n\n                                  14\n\f     1.   Appellant’s Facial Challenge\n\n     For appellant to prevail on his claim that the Hobbs Act is\n\nfacially unconstitutional, he must establish that there is no set\n\nof circumstances in which the Act be applied constitutionally. See\n\nBarnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d 1335, 1342 (5th Cir.) (internal\n\ncitations omitted), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 976, 114 S.Ct. 468, 126\n\nL.Ed.2d 419 (1993).   That is, he must show that Congress could not\n\nrationally have determined that any single instance of robbery or\n\nextortion proscribed by the Act falls within the reach of its\n\nregulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.\n\n     This places a heavy burden on the appellant.             “A facial\n\nchallenge to a legislative Act is . . . the most difficult\n\nchallenge to mount successfully.”      Webster v. Reproductive Health\n\nServices, 492 U.S. 490, 524, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3060, 106 L.Ed.2d 410\n\n(1989) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).    The mere possibility that the Act “might\n\noperate   unconstitutionally   under     some   conceivable    set   of\n\ncircumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid . . . .”\n\nId. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n     Appellant seeks to establish that the Hobbs Act is invariably\n\nunconstitutional in application by following the Supreme Court’s\n\nreasoning in Lopez.   He claims that the Hobbs Act, like the Gun-\n\nFree School Zones Act, neither regulates the use of the channels of\n\ncommerce nor protects persons and things in, or instrumentalities\n\nof, interstate commerce.   He then purports to explain why the Act\n\ncannot be applied constitutionally as a regulation of intrastate\n\n\n                                 15\n\factivities which substantially affect interstate commerce.\n\n      This   argument   is   utterly    misguided.         It   relies    on    the\n\nunsupported    assumption    that      the   Hobbs   Act    can    be     applied\n\nconstitutionally, if at all, solely under the third branch of the\n\ncommerce power.     We think it obvious that in various factual\n\nsettings, the Act proscribes conduct which Congress may reach under\n\nthe first two branches of the commerce power.          For example, a Hobbs\n\nAct   prosecution   for   hijacking     a    truck   and   its    cargo    on    an\n\ninterstate highway surely could be upheld under either the first or\n\nsecond branch of the commerce power.\n\n      On that basis alone, appellant cannot meet his burden of\n\nestablishing that the Hobbs Act is invariably unconstitutional in\n\nall factual circumstances.6         Moreover, as we explain below, the\n\nHobbs Act can be applied constitutionally under the third branch of\n\nthe commerce power, given the requisite effect on interstate\n\ncommerce.    Because there are circumstances in which the Hobbs Act\n\noperates constitutionally, we reject appellant’s facial challenge.\n\n      2.   Appellant’s As-Applied Challenge\n\n      The main thrust of appellant’s brief is that the Hobbs Act is\n\nunconstitutional as applied to intrastate activities, such as the\n\nsubject robberies, which affect interstate commerce.                His theory\n\n\n      6\n     Appellant’s facial challenge is essentially a claim that the\nstatute sweeps too broadly; in his view, “the Hobbs Act overreaches\nimpermissibly beyond the ‘substantially affects’ restraint imposed\nby the Supreme Court in Lopez.” Unfortunately for appellant, the\nSupreme Court has “not recognized an ‘overbreadth’ doctrine outside\nthe limited context of the First Amendment.” Webster, 492 U.S. at\n524, 109 S.Ct. at 3060 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                                       16\n\fwith respect to this genus of Hobbs Act prosecutions is simple and\n\nrather elegant; we view it also to be wrong.\n\n     Appellant   contends        that   because   a   specific        Hobbs   Act\n\nconviction requires only an “effect” on interstate commerce, the\n\nLopez requirement of a “substantial effect” in cases involving\n\nintrastate activity is not met.         The government responds that even\n\nif the substantial effect test applies, the Hobbs Act passes it.7\n\n     In determining whether the effect of a regulated activity on\n\ninterstate   commerce   is   substantial,      courts    must    look    to   the\n\ncumulative   effect   of   all    similar    instances   of     the    regulated\n\nactivity, carried on in different places by different persons.\n\nLopez did not undermine this principle, which was articulated\n\ndecades ago in Wickard v. Filburn.            To the contrary, the Lopez\n\ncourt categorically stated:\n\n     Where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial\n     relation to commerce, the de minimis character of\n     individual instances arising under that statute is of no\n     consequence.\n\n       7\n        The government suggests in passing that the substantial\neffect test may not apply. Of the five circuits to have upheld the\nHobbs Act against Lopez-based challenges, only the Tenth Circuit\ndid so by applying the substantial effect test. See Bolton, 68\nF.3d at 99. The Ninth Circuit and District of Columbia Circuit\nexplicitly held the test inapplicable on the ground that the Hobbs\nAct regulated interstate, rather than intrastate, activities. See\nHarrington, 108 F.3d at 1470; Atcheson, 94 F.3d at 1242-43.\n     These cases relied on the Supreme Court’s holding that the\nsubstantial effect test governs only “purely intrastate commercial\nactivities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects.”\nUnited States v. Robertson, 514 U.S. 669, ---, 115 S.Ct. 1732,\n1733, 131 L.Ed.2d 714 (1995) (per curiam) (emphasis in original)\n(internal citation omitted).\n     In our view the Hobbs Act regulates both interstate commercial\nactivities and intrastate activities that affect interstate\ncommerce.   In any event, we need not decide whether Robertson\nsupplies an alternative basis for upholding the Act.\n\n                                        17\n\fLopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1629 (internal quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n      The third branch of the commerce power would be negligible if\n\nits exercise were limited to particular incidents, each of which\n\nindividually has a substantial effect upon the nation’s commerce.\n\nUnder this straitened interpretation of congressional power, such\n\nclearly established uses of the commerce power as the mining\n\nlegislation in Hodel and the civil rights legislation in McClung\n\nwould be called into question.               As our court has noted, however,\n\nLopez “did not purport to eliminate or erode well-established\n\nCommerce Clause precedents.”                Knutson, 113 F.3d at 29 (citing\n\nLopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1634).\n\n      It    is     a   bedrock      principle      of   modern    Commerce   Clause\n\njurisprudence that Congress may regulate a category of activity\n\nwhose      many    instances,       taken    together,       substantially   affect\n\ninterstate        commerce.      The      Court    explained     this   aggregation\n\nprinciple in McClung, a case involving a restaurant which bought\n\nmeat from a local supplier who in turn was supplied from out of\n\nstate.     The Court observed:\n\n      It goes without saying           that, viewed in isolation, the\n      volume of food purchased         at Ollie’s Barbecue from sources\n      supplied from out of             state was insignificant when\n      compared with the total          foodstuffs moving in commerce.\n\n379 U.S. at 300-01, 85 S.Ct. at 382.                The Court nonetheless found\n\nthe   requisite        connection    to     interstate      commerce,   quoting   the\n\nWickard     Court’s      reasoning     for       applying    federal    agricultural\n\nregulations to the production and consumption of homegrown wheat:\n\n      That appellee’s own contribution to the demand for wheat\n\n                                            18\n\f     may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from\n     the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his\n     contribution, taken together with that of many others\n     similarly situated, is far from trivial.\n\nId. at 301, 85 S.Ct. at 382 (quoting Wickard, ---U.S. at 127-28, 63\n\nS.Ct. at 90).     The same note was sounded by Justice Black,\n\nconcurring in both McClung and Heart of Atlanta Motel:\n\n     [I]n deciding the constitutional power of Congress in\n     cases like the two before us we do not consider the\n     effect on interstate commerce of only one isolated,\n     individual, local event, without regard to the fact that\n     this single local event when added to many others of a\n     similar nature may impose a burden on interstate commerce\n     by reducing its volume or distorting its flow.\n\n379 U.S. at 275, 85 S.Ct. at 367 (Black, J., concurring).\n\n     The Tenth Circuit relied on this aggregation principle to\n\nuphold the Hobbs Act against a Lopez-based challenge.          See United\n\nStates v. Bolton, 68 F.3d 396, 399 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. denied,\n\n---U.S.---, 116 S.Ct. 966, 133 L.Ed.2d 887 (1996).              The court\n\nobserved that “Lopez did not . . . require the government to show\n\nthat individual instances of the regulated activity substantially\n\naffect commerce . . . .” Id. at 399.         The Tenth Circuit instead\n\nread Lopez as allowing for the application of federal law based on\n\na de minimis nexus to interstate commerce, provided that the\n\n“statute   regulates   an   activity    which,   through   repetition,    in\n\naggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.”              Id.\n\n(internal citation omitted).      The court found that the Hobbs Act\n\nwas such a statute and upheld its constitutionality.          Id.\n\n     We find the reasoning of Bolton unassailable.          We agree that\n\nunder the third category of the commerce power described in Lopez,\n\nthe particular conduct at issue in any given case need not have a\n\n                                   19\n\fsubstantial effect upon interstate commerce.                        Congress is free to\n\nact--and the government to apply the law--so long as the regulated\n\nactivity,       in   the      aggregate,      could        reasonably    be   thought   to\n\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.\n\n     Appellant’s as-applied challenge to the Hobbs Act collapses in\n\nthe face of the aggregation principle.                        Every robbery or act of\n\nextortion in violation of the Hobbs Act must have an effect on\n\ninterstate      commerce;       the    Act’s        express    jurisdictional      element\n\nensures   this.          It    follows       with    the    inexorable    logic    of   the\n\nmultiplication table that the cumulative result of many Hobbs Act\n\nviolations      is   a     substantial        effect       upon    interstate   commerce.\n\nUnlike    gun    possession       in     a    school       zone,   robberies    affecting\n\ninterstate commerce are precisely the sort of acts “that might,\n\nthrough repetition elsewhere, substantially affect . . . interstate\n\ncommerce.”       Cf. Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1634.\n\n     In this case, there was evidence that the stores targeted by\n\nRobinson’s gang were robbed of thousands of dollars and, moreover,\n\nthat the robberies impaired their ability to cash out-of-state\n\nchecks and to restock goods shipped from other states.                            The jury\n\nnecessarily found that this disruption amounted to an effect on\n\ninterstate commerce.            We have no doubt that such disruptions, if\n\nrepeated at retail stores across the nation, would amount to a\n\nsubstantial effect upon interstate commerce.                            Accordingly, we\n\nreject appellant’s claim that with respect to his intrastate\n\nactivities, which may have affected interstate commerce less than\n\nsubstantially, the Act was unconstitutionally applied.\n\n\n                                               20\n\f       3.    Related Prosecutorial and Trial Errors\n\n       Appellant presents a final cluster of arguments relating to\n\nthe    supposed    inadequacy    of   the     indictment,   proof,    and   jury\n\ninstructions.      He contends that the indictment failed to allege\n\nthat   the    subject   robberies     substantially     affected     interstate\n\ncommerce.      He further contends that the evidence at trial was\n\ninsufficient to prove a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\n\nFinally, he claims that the district court erred by failing to\n\ninstruct the jury that such proof was required.\n\n       Assuming these arguments have been preserved for review, they\n\nare entirely without merit. Because a Hobbs Act robbery, viewed in\n\nisolation, need not have more than a minimal effect upon interstate\n\ncommerce, appellant’s arguments fall of their own weight.\n\n       Appellant’s challenge to his firearm conviction was entirely\n\nderivative of his Hobbs Act arguments.                A conviction under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 924(c)(1) must be premised on the use or carrying of a\n\nfirearm in connection with a crime subject to federal jurisdiction.\n\nRobinson contends that because the underlying robberies were not\n\nconstitutionally within the reach of federal law, his firearm\n\nconviction is invalid.        Our finding that the Hobbs Act was applied\n\nconstitutionally disposes of this argument. Accord Bolton, 68 F.3d\n\nat 399 n.2.\n\n       Appellant    urges    reversal    of    his   convictions   on   several\n\nadditional grounds.         Having carefully considered the arguments in\n\nlight of the record and the applicable law, we hold that no\n\nreversible error occurred.        We affirm on all counts.\n\n\n                                        21\n\f      F.    First Principles Revisited\n\n      Because of the profound issues raised by the Lopez decision,\n\nand in light of the guerilla campaign now being waged against\n\nfederal statutes in the name of Lopez,8 we offer these concluding\n\nobservations.\n\n      We are acutely aware that the robbery of a neighborhood store,\n\nor   even   several    such   stores   in   one   large   city,    is     not   the\n\nprototypical Hobbs Act violation.           As other courts have noted, the\n\nprincipal evil which inspired the passage of the Hobbs Act was,\n\nquite    literally,    highway   robbery,     especially    those        robberies\n\ncommitted by racketeers operating through labor unions. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Woodruff, 941 F.Supp. 910, 916-17 (N.D. Cal. 1996)\n\n(internal citations omitted).          As the Eighth Circuit has aptly\n\nobserved, the congressional authors of the Hobbs Act “no doubt . .\n\n. had in mind primarily offenses with a broad impact on interstate\n\ncommerce, as opposed to local robberies normally prosecuted under\n\nstate law[.]”     Farmer, 73 F.3d at 843.          However, the reach of a\n\nstatute is not determined by its authors’ thoughts but by their\n\nwords, and the text of the Hobbs Act “in no way exclude[s]\n\nprosecutions     for    single   local      robberies,”    so     long    as    the\n\nrequirement of a nexus to interstate commerce is met.                Id.\n\n\n     8\n     By one count, by December 1995 (a mere eight months after the\nLopez decision) more than eighty district and circuit court\nopinions had decided Lopez-based challenges to federal criminal\nstatutes. See Andrew Weis, Note, Commerce Clause in the Cross-\nHairs, 48 STAN. L. REV. 1431, 1432 (1996). Among the most frequently\nchallenged statutes are those prohibiting machine-gun possession,\ncarjacking, failure to pay child support, and gun possession by\nfelons. Id. at 1432-33 (internal citations omitted).\n\n                                       22\n\f      Eloquent voices have been raised against precisely this sort\n\nof   federalization   of   the   criminal   law.9   Among   the   familiar\n\ncomplaints are that the creation of new federal crimes burdens the\n\nfederal courts, delaying civil trials; that similarly situated\n\ndefendants receive unequal procedural protections and sentences,\n\ndepending on whether they are charged under state or federal law;\n\nand that the expansion of federal jurisdiction impedes the ability\n\nof the states to innovate in the field of criminal justice.          Andrew\n\nWeis, Note, Commerce Clause in the Cross-Hairs, 48 STAN. L. REV.\n\n1431, 1439-40 (1996).\n\n      Whether the proliferation of federal crimes should be lamented\n\nor celebrated, however, is not for us to say.         The federal courts\n\nwere not elected to represent the will of the people and ought not\n\nsuperintend congressional policy judgments. Our opinion today does\n\nnot address the wisdom of applying the Hobbs Act to local crimes\n\nthat affect interstate commerce, but only the constitutionality of\n\ndoing so.   In upholding the Act, we have relied on the analytical\n\nframework of Lopez, interpreted consistently with several decades\n\nof prior Commerce Clause decisions.\n\n      In our view, Lopez teaches two quite distinct lessons. First,\n\nLopez stands for the principle that certain activities, but not\n\n      9\n       As the late Judge Henry J. Friendly put it:\n\n      The Founding Fathers, I think, would have been surprised\n      to find the federal courts trying cases of corruption in\n      the New York City administration simply because one of\n      the participants had rowed across the Hudson in the\n      course of the criminal venture.\n\nHENRY J. FRIENDLY, FEDERAL JURISDICTION: A GENERAL VIEW 61 (1973).\n\n                                    23\n\fothers, can be regulated under the Commerce Clause.               Lopez holds\n\nthat the proper objects of the interstate commerce power are\n\ninterstate commerce and those local activities which, in isolation\n\nor   in    the    aggregate,   substantially   affect    it.      The    Court’s\n\nelaboration of this point yielded the rules of decision which we\n\nemployed, with little difficulty, in our analysis today.\n\n      The second, more subtle lesson of Lopez is that there are\n\n“outer limits” to the commerce power, beyond which Congress may not\n\ntrespass.        See Lopez, 514 U.S. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1628.            These\n\nlimits exist because of the importance of the states in the\n\nstructure of our federal system, and because of the disastrous\n\nconsequences       which   would   follow   were   we   to   “obliterate     the\n\ndistinction between what is national and what is local.”                Id. at --\n\n-, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.\n\n      Precisely how the lower federal courts are to police the outer\n\nboundary of the commerce power is left unsaid.10             In particular, we\n\ndo not yet know whether a statute which passes the substantial\n\neffect test of Lopez may nonetheless be struck down as intruding\n\ninto areas traditionally managed by the states.              Previous judicial\n\nexperiments in protecting the states from federal encroachment\n\nunder the commerce power have a mixed record of success.                     See\n\nNational League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49\n\n\n      10\n      At one point the Court suggests that a plain statement rule\nmay apply.   See id. at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 (quoting United\nStates v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d\n488 (1971) (“[U]nless Congress states its purpose clearly, it will\nnot be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-state\nbalance.”)).\n\n                                      24\n\fL.Ed.2d 245 (1976), overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.\n\nTransit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016\n\n(1985).   But see New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 176, 112\n\nS.Ct. 2408, 2428, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (federal government cannot\n\n“commandeer[] the legislative processes of the States . . . .”\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n\n     As the circuit that struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act,\n\nwe are acutely aware of the importance of protecting the integrity\n\nof the states and preventing the commerce power from becoming a\n\nnational police power.        In our own cases, we have taken steps\n\ntoward    setting    an   outer   limit     on   the    commerce      power    by\n\ncircumscribing      the   government’s     ability     to    prosecute   crimes\n\ntargeting private residences and individuals in their homes.                   See\n\nUnited States v. Collins, 40 F.3d 95, 99 (5th Cir. 1994) (holding\n\ninterstate   commerce     nexus   “too    attenuated”       where   employee   of\n\nnational computer company was robbed at home); see also United\n\nStates v. Corona, 108 F.3d 565, 570 (5th Cir. 1997) (casting doubt\n\non sufficiency of commercial nexus in a federal arson prosecution\n\nbased on a fire at a private home) (dicta).                 Nothing in today’s\n\ndecision forecloses the development of this line of cases.\n\n     Despite these efforts, we recognize that there is a danger in\n\nthe courts transforming a general axiom of federalism into a rule\n\nof decision to determine the outcome of particular cases.                       A\n\njurisprudence of undefined “outer limits” surely would repose too\n\nmuch discretion in the courts.      See, e.g., Woodruff, 941 F.Supp. at\n\n913 (striking down Hobbs Act conviction in order “to correct an\n\n\n                                     25\n\fimbalance in the scales of power”).           Our task as judges is not to\n\ngo abroad in search of dragons to slay.           In this circuit, we shall\n\napply the doctrinal rules articulated by Lopez and other binding\n\nprecedents, albeit with a heightened sensitivity to potential\n\nfederal incursions into the traditional sphere of state authority.\n\n     Fortunately, the case before us does not involve a federal law\n\nthat intrudes into an area traditionally within the exclusive\n\npurview of the states.           This is not a case involving public\n\neducation, domestic relations or municipal zoning.11            Although this\n\nis a criminal case, the statute at issue was enacted to protect the\n\nnation’s commerce from local threats which, in the aggregate, could\n\nsubstantially affect that commerce.           There is no usurpation here.\n\n     In sum, we uphold the Hobbs Act and its application to\n\nRobinson, confident that our decision does no violence to the\n\nprinciple of limited federal power articulated in Lopez.\n\n     III.         DISCUSSION OF SENTENCING ISSUES\n\n     Appellant was sentenced on September 6, 1996, to 210 months\n\nimprisonment on the Hobbs Act counts and a consecutive term of 60\n\nmonths on the firearm count.           See generally UNITED STATES SENTENCING\n\nCOMMISSION, GUIDELINES MANUAL (1995).        He contends that the district\n\ncourt   impermissibly       enhanced   his   offense   level   based   on    the\n\n“vulnerable victim” guideline, U.S.S.G.           § 3A1.1.     We agree.12\n\n             11\n          We use these as examples of subjects traditionally\nsuperintended by state law. We intimate no opinion as to whether\nfederal legislation regulating any of these areas might be\nconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.\n        12\n       We reject appellant’s contention that the district court\nerred by enhancing his offense level for obstruction of justice.\n\n                                       26\n\f      The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement of\n\nthe defendant’s offense level for offenses against “unusually\n\nvulnerable” victims.     The applicable guideline states:\n\n      If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim\n      of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age,\n      physical or mental condition, or that a victim was\n      otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal\n      conduct, increase by 2 levels.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b).\n\n      By its terms, this section applies only if (1) a victim was\n\nunusually vulnerable because of age, physical or mental condition,\n\nor   was    “otherwise   particularly   susceptible   to   the   criminal\n\nconduct”; and (2) the defendant actually knew or should have known\n\nof the victim’s vulnerability or susceptibility. See United States\n\nv. Castellanos, 81 F.3d 108, 110 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n      Appellant received a “vulnerable victim” enhancement for each\n\ncount of conviction. His enhanced offense level for each count was\n\nthen incorporated into the calculation of his sentence under the\n\nguidelines’ rules for grouping multiple counts.        See U.S.S.G. Ch.\n\n3, Pt. D.    Robinson objected to each vulnerable victim enhancement\n\nin the court below and now appeals these adjustments to his offense\n\nlevel.      We review the district court’s interpretation of the\n\nguidelines de novo; we review a finding of unusual vulnerability\n\nfor clear error and to determine whether the district court’s\n\nconclusion was “plausible in light of the record as a whole.”\n\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. We likewise reject his claim that the district\ncourt impermissibly double-counted the conduct underlying his\nfirearm conviction as the basis for both a consecutive sentence and\nan offense level enhancement. See U.S.S.G. §§ 2B3.1(b)(2)(A),(C);\nid. § 2K2.4, comment., note 2; id. § 3D1.1, comment., note 1.\n\n                                   27\n\fUnited States v. Scurlock, 52 F.3d 531, 541-42 (5th Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Brown, 7 F.3d 1155, 1160 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     The vulnerable victim enhancements in this case were proposed\n\nin the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) prepared by the\n\nprobation   officer.   Prior   to    sentencing,   appellant   objected,\n\ncontending that the victims in this case were not “unusually\n\nvulnerable.”    He pointed out that according to the guidelines\n\ncommentary, “a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim\n\nsolely by virtue of the teller’s position in a bank.”          U.S.S.G. §\n\n3A1.1(b), comment., note 2.     Robinson argued that the merchants\n\nvictimized in this case were analogous to the bank teller described\n\nin the commentary, and were distinguishable from the commentary’s\n\nexamples of unusually vulnerable victims--defrauded cancer patients\n\nand handicapped robbery victims.\n\n     In an addendum to the PSR, the probation officer responded\n\nthat the vulnerable victim enhancement was warranted.      She stated:\n\n     The victims targeted in these offenses were Asian or\n     Korean [sic] business people who were either the owners\n     of a convenience store or some other business\n     establishment which kept large amounts of cash.      The\n     business   establishments   were  in   ethnic   minority\n     neighborhoods and cashed checks for people living in the\n     neighborhood. It is the probation office[’]s position\n     that these victims were more susceptible to this type of\n     offense and were targeted for that reason.\n\n     The district court, expressly adopting the probation officer’s\n\nreasoning, held that Robinson “knew or should have known that these\n\nrobberies were being committed with the intention of preying upon\n\nAsian and Korean [sic] business people and that these individuals\n\nwere selected because of their vulnerability.”          The government\n\n\n                                    28\n\fseeks to uphold this enhancement on the ground that the Asian-\n\nAmerican merchants targeted “were not as ‘street-savvy’ or ‘crime-\n\nconscious’” as other merchants.                 The government cites Thompson’s\n\ntestimony         that   Asian-Americans    were     perceived       as   careless   in\n\nhandling large sums of cash.\n\n     We hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that\n\nthese victims were “unusually vulnerable.”                 The guidelines do not\n\nsupport the view that members of racial minority groups, in this\n\ncase Asian-Americans, are unusually susceptible to crime.13                    Nor is\n\na vulnerable victim enhancement appropriate on the basis of the\n\nvictims’ employment as merchants in stores that deal in a high\n\nvolume       of    cash.    Under   the    guidelines,     a    vulnerable     victim\n\nenhancement must stem from a personal trait or condition of the\n\nvictim, rather than the position he occupies or his method of doing\n\nbusiness.         “Unless the criminal act is directed against the young,\n\nthe aged, the handicapped, or unless the victim is chosen because\n\nof some unusual personal vulnerability, § 3A1.1[b] cannot be\n\nemployed.”         United States v. Paige, 923 F.2d 112, 113 (8th Cir.\n\n1991)        (internal     quotation      marks      and   citations        omitted).\n\nApplication of the vulnerable victim guideline is limited to cases\n\nin which the victims “are in need of greater societal protection”\n\nand the offenses are thus “more criminally depraved” than they\n\nwould    be       otherwise.    Castellanos,        81   F.3d   at    111   (internal\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n        13\n       The government has never claimed that these offenses were\nracially motivated hate crimes subject to enhancement under\nU.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(a).\n\n                                           29\n\f     In this case, the victims were not selected because of any\n\n“unusual personal vulnerability,” nor were they in demonstrably\n\ngreater need of societal protection than other crime victims.              To\n\nparaphrase the bank robber Willie Sutton, the victims’ stores were\n\ntargeted because that is where the money was.           Their possession of\n\nlarge amounts of cash and their perceived carelessness with it are\n\nnot grounds for enhancement under the vulnerable victim guideline.\n\n     We need not decide whether, in some circumstances, a victim’s\n\nimmigrant   status   or   lack   of   street   smarts    might   render   him\n\n“otherwise particularly susceptible” to crime within the meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3A1.1(b).        The district court did not rely on this\n\nrationale, but on the fact that the victims were Asian-American\n\nmerchants   who   handled   large     bankrolls.   A     vulnerable   victim\n\nenhancement based upon the victim’s race, employment, and business\n\nhabits, without more, cannot stand.\n\n     IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n     Appellant’s convictions are AFFIRMED. His sentence is VACATED\n\nand the case REMANDED for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      30\n\f",

The appellant, relying on United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), contends that the Act is unconstitutional because it authorizes conviction of a defendant whose conduct affects commerce \"in any way or degree.\"   By contrast, Lopez identified specific circumstances in which federal statutes, to withstand constitutional scrutiny, must affect interstate commerce substantially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the lessons of Lopez, we hold that the Hobbs Act is a permissible exercise of the congressional power to regulate commerce among the states.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring and early summer of 1995, several small businesses in the Dallas area were victimized in a series of crimes that became known as the \"driveway bank robberies.\"   The victims were owners and employees of liquor stores, convenience stores, and other retail and service establishments.  The stores provided check-cashing services;  the record reflects that the stores cashed out-of-state checks, payroll checks, and government benefit checks.  The record also reflects that several of the stores sold products that had been shipped to Texas from other states.  The victims testified that they suffered substantial business losses as a result of the robberies;  one store was forced to close permanently for lack of capital, and the others were unable to cash checks for a finite period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The robberies were carried out through a relatively sophisticated technique known as \"jugging,\" in which the perpetrators reconnoitered the stores, learned their business routines, and struck immediately after the victims had made substantial bank withdrawals for use in cashing their customers' checks.  Typically the robberies took place in the commercial drive-up lane of the bank or in the parking lot of the store as the owner or employee returned with a cash withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An investigation by a violent crimes task force comprising FBI agents and Dallas police officers led to the arrest of the principal suspect, Ernest Thompson, on July 1, 1995.  Arrested with Thompson was the appellant, Anthony W. Robinson, who subsequently made several self-incriminating statements to investigators.  Thompson eventually pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution at Robinson's trial.  A money-laundering charge against a third defendant was dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson was indicted on charges of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act and aiding and abetting three robberies in violation of the Act.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951(a), 2.  The victims testified at trial that these robberies caused business losses of approximately $5,000 each to Maple Convenience Store and West End Liquors, and $60,000 to S &amp; S Foods.  Each Hobbs Act robbery count was accompanied by a count alleging that Robinson aided and abetted the possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1), 2.  Two of the three firearm counts were dismissed by the district court.  Before trial, the government dismissed a separate count charging Robinson as principal in a fourth Hobbs Act robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Robinson was convicted on the remaining counts:  Hobbs Act conspiracy, aiding and abetting three Hobbs Act robberies, and aiding and abetting one firearm violation.  He was sentenced to a prison term of 210 months on the Hobbs Act counts and a consecutive 60-month term on the firearm count.  He appeals his convictions and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE HOBBS ACT CONVICTIONS</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Introduction:  First Principles</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of the \"first principles\" articulated by the Supreme Court in Lopez:  that the national government is one of enumerated powers, and that the division of authority between the national government and the states is intended to preserve the liberties of the people.  514 U.S. at 551-53, 115 S.Ct. at 1626.  Lopez vividly reminds us that from time to time, the judiciary must intercede to assure that Congress does not, by enacting unconstitutional legislation under the guise of the commerce power, dramatically alter the balance of federalism.  We are also well aware of the arguments against shifting the primary responsibility for enacting and enforcing the criminal law from the states to the central government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, we recognize the broad sweep of Congress's constitutional authority \"[t]o regulate [c]ommerce ... among the several [s]tates,\" and its concomitant power to protect the nation's commerce by enacting such laws as it deems \"necessary and proper.\"  U.S. CONST. art.

The Commerce Clause has long been recognized as \"one of the most prolific sources of national power,\" H.P. Hood &amp; Sons v.

The courts must be vigilant to prevent Congress from asserting powers not delegated to the national government by the Constitution, but must themselves avoid usurping the national legislature's policy-making role in the commercial sphere.  As the next section makes clear, the Constitution's delegation to Congress of the power to regulate the nation's commercial life commands a significant degree of judicial deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The latter point bears emphasis.  In the wake of Lopez, courts are less likely to take congressional invocations of the commerce power at face value, at least when the regulated activity's relation to interstate commerce is \"[in]visible to the naked eye....\"  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 563, 115 S.Ct. at 1632.   In that sense, we read Lopez as an admonition that rational basis scrutiny is not tantamount to an abdication of the judiciary's responsibility \"to say what the law is.\"  Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177, 5 U.S. 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803), cited in Lopez, 514 U.S. at 565-67, 115 S.Ct. at 1633.  \"[D]eference is not acquiescence....\"  United States v.

The Lopez Court catalogued three principal ways in which Congress may validly exercise its constitutional power to regulate interstate commerce.  Before considering the Hobbs Act itself, we turn to the Lopez decision and its taxonomy of the commerce power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Alfonso Lopez, Jr., a twelfth-grade student at Edison High School in San Antonio, had been arrested for carrying a handgun and five bullets to school.  This court reversed his conviction for violating the Gun-Free School Zones Act, and the Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the statute was unsupported by the congressional power to regulate commerce.  United States v. Lopez, 2 F.3d 1342 (5th Cir.1993), aff'd, 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Lopez Court described \"three broad categories of activity\" that Congress may regulate under the commerce power.  514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.  \"First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.\"  Id.  This category extends beyond the regulation of highways, railroads, air routes, navigable rivers, fiber-optic cables and the like.  Under pre-Lopez precedents, Congress may legislate \"to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses....\"  Id.  (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 256, 85 S.Ct. 348, 357, 13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  This branch of the commerce power thus provided a basis for the civil rights legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in public accommodations upheld in Heart of Atlanta Motel.   This category also is generally understood to encompass legislation aimed at preventing the misuse of the channels of commerce, such as statutes prohibiting interstate traffic in kidnapped persons, stolen goods, and prostitutes.  See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1201, 2314, 2421.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second category comprises \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce.\"  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.   This branch of the commerce power supports, for example, federal legislation prohibiting the destruction of aircraft and the theft of goods from interstate shipments.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 557-59, 115 S.Ct. at 1629 (citing Perez v. United States, 402 U.S. 146, 150, 91 S.Ct. 1357, 1359-60, 28 L.Ed.2d 686 (1971)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the commerce power \"includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"  Id. at 558-59, 115 S.Ct. at 1629-30 (citations omitted).  Lopez squarely held that under this third category, federal legislation concerning an intrastate activity is permissible only when the regulated activity \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.  A \"relatively trivial\" effect on interstate commerce cannot serve as a pretext for the \"broad general regulation of state or private activities.\"  Id. at 559, 115 S.Ct. at 1630 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nonetheless, activities which at first blush appear to be local in character repeatedly have been held subject to federal regulation because, either standing alone or cumulatively, they substantially affect interstate commerce.  According to the Supreme Court, examples include coal mining, loan-sharking, the operation of racially segregated restaurants and hotels, and the production and consumption of homegrown wheat.  Id. at 559-61, 115 S.Ct. at 1630 (citing Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), Perez, McClung, Heart of Atlanta Motel, and Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111, 63 S.Ct. 82, 87 L.Ed. 122 (1942)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lopez, the Supreme Court quickly dismissed the possibility that the Gun-Free School Zones Act fell within either of the first two categories.  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 559-61, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.   The Court then analyzed the statute under the third category and found it constitutionally deficient for three reasons.  First, the Gun-Free School Zones Act had \"nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic activity, however broadly one might define those terms.\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   Because the possession of a gun near a school has no demonstrable effect on commerce, Congress could not rationally have concluded that the proscribed conduct, \"viewed in the aggregate,\" substantially affected interstate commerce.  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631.   Second, the Gun-Free School Zones Act did not contain an express jurisdictional element which would have \"ensure[d], through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affect[ed] interstate commerce.\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631.   Finally, there were neither legislative findings nor a legislative history illuminating how Congress rationally could have determined that gun possession in school zones substantially affected interstate commerce.  Congressional findings, though not strictly required, might have revealed a constitutional basis for the legislation \"even though no ... substantial effect [upon interstate commerce] was visible to the naked eye....\"  Id. at 563, 115 S.Ct. at 1632.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think Lopez makes clear that legislation concerning an intrastate activity will be upheld if Congress could rationally have concluded that the activity, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.  This standard will almost certainly be met if a statutory jurisdictional element ensures that an effect on interstate commerce must be proved in each case.  Even in the absence of such a statutory requirement, we will uphold the challenged statute if the regulated conduct's connection to interstate commerce is manifest, i.e., \"visible to the naked eye.\"   If we do not readily perceive a clear connection to interstate commerce, we may nevertheless uphold the statute if the nexus is satisfactorily explained by congressional findings or the legislative history.  Conversely, if the statute, the congressional findings, and the legislative history provide no rational basis for concluding that the regulated activity has the required nexus to interstate commerce, the statute must fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Hobbs Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act imposes criminal penalties on anyone who \"in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion[,] or attempts or conspires so to do....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a).  The statutory definition of \"commerce\" is co-extensive with constitutional limits;  the Act defines \"commerce\" to include \"all commerce between any point in a State ... and any point outside thereof;  ...  and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are thus two elements in a Hobbs Act prosecution:  (1) a robbery, act of extortion, or an attempt or conspiracy to rob or extort;  and (2) an interference with interstate commerce.  Stirone v. United States, 361 U.S. 212, 218, 80 S.Ct. 270, 274, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960).  It follows from the second element that an effect on commerce must be proven in every case.  However, the pre-Lopez case law firmly established that this so-called jurisdictional element is satisfied by a showing of a minimal effect on interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  United States v. Box, 50 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir.)  (internal citation omitted) (\"slight\" effect), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 309, 133 L.Ed.2d 213 (1995);  United States v. Collins, 40 F.3d 95, 99 (5th Cir.1994) (\"de minimis \" effect), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1121, 115 S.Ct. 1986, 131 L.Ed.2d 873 (1995).  Moreover, a robbery or extortionate act that depletes the assets of a commercial enterprise, impairing or delaying its ability to buy goods or services in interstate commerce, satisfies the jurisdictional test.  See, e.g., Collins, 40 F.3d at 99;  United States v. Martinez, 28 F.3d 444, 445 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 910, 115 S.Ct. 281, 130 L.Ed.2d 197 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court long ago upheld the Hobbs Act against a Commerce Clause challenge, reasoning that the statute \"is directed at the protection of interstate commerce....\"  United States v. Green, 350 U.S. 415, 420, 76 S.Ct. 522, 526, 100 L.Ed. 494 (1956).  The question is whether the Act remains valid in light of its requirement of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, or whether Lopez requires a substantial effect.  As explained below, we conclude that even if Lopez imposes a new requirement of substantiality, that requirement applies to the class of cases prosecuted in the aggregate;  in any particular case, proof of a slight effect on interstate commerce suffices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Constitutionality of the Hobbs Act under Lopez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act differs from the late Gun-Free School Zones Act in critical respects.  The Gun-Free School Zones Act concerned an activity, gun possession in and near schools, which bore no evident relation to interstate commerce.  In contrast, the nexus between robbery and commerce is obvious:  a successful robbery results in the transfer of money or goods from the victim to the perpetrator.  Where, as in this case, the money belongs to commercial establishments engaged in interstate commercial transactions, the connection between the crime and interstate commerce is not difficult to discern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Hobbs Act includes an express jurisdictional element of the sort conspicuously lacking in the Gun-Free School Zones Act.  This requirement explicitly limits the scope of the Hobbs Act to those robberies and extortion schemes which affect interstate commerce.  Compare Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561-63, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 (faulting the Gun-Free School Zones Act for the absence of an \"express jurisdictional requirement which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that ... have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nonetheless invokes Lopez to challenge his Hobbs Act convictions on several grounds.  Appellant's terminology is none too precise, but we understand him to be making three distinct arguments.  First, he claims that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional on its face because it allows convictions on evidence of less than a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Second, he argues that the Act is unconstitutional as applied to a broad category of cases, including this one, involving local crimes whose effect on interstate commerce is less than substantial.  Finally, he argues that the indictment, evidence, and jury instructions were deficient because they did not adhere to the substantial effect requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Appellant's Facial Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For appellant to prevail on his claim that the Hobbs Act is facially unconstitutional, he must establish that there is no set of circumstances in which the Act could be applied constitutionally.  See Barnes v. Mississippi, 992 F.2d 1335, 1342 (5th Cir.)  (internal citations omitted), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 976, 114 S.Ct. 468, 126 L.Ed.2d 419 (1993).  That is, he must show that Congress could not rationally have determined that any single instance of robbery or extortion proscribed by the Act falls within the reach of its regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This places a heavy burden on the appellant.  \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is ... the most difficult challenge to mount successfully.\"  Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 524, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3060, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The mere possibility that the Act \"might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid....\"  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to establish that the Hobbs Act is invariably unconstitutional in application by following the Supreme Court's reasoning in Lopez.   He claims that the Hobbs Act, like the Gun-Free School Zones Act, neither regulates the use of the channels of commerce nor protects persons and things in, or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce.  He then purports to explain why the Act cannot be applied constitutionally as a regulation of intrastate activities which substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is utterly misguided.  It relies on the unsupported assumption that the Hobbs Act can be applied constitutionally, if at all, solely under the third branch of the commerce power.  We think it obvious that in various factual settings, the Act proscribes conduct which Congress may reach under the first two branches of the commerce power.  For example, a Hobbs Act prosecution for hijacking a truck and its cargo on an interstate highway surely could be upheld under either the first or second branch of the commerce power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that basis alone, appellant cannot meet his burden of establishing that the Hobbs Act is invariably unconstitutional in all factual circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, as we explain below, the Hobbs Act can be applied constitutionally under the third branch of the commerce power, given the requisite effect on interstate commerce.  Because there are circumstances in which the Hobbs Act operates constitutionally, we reject appellant's facial challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Appellant's As-Applied Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main thrust of appellant's brief is that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional as applied to intrastate activities, such as the subject robberies, which affect interstate commerce.  His theory with respect to this genus of Hobbs Act prosecutions is simple and rather elegant;  we view it also to be wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that because a specific Hobbs Act conviction requires only an \"effect\" on interstate commerce, the Lopez requirement of a \"substantial effect\" in cases involving intrastate activity is not met.  The government responds that even if the substantial effect test applies, the Hobbs Act passes it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether the effect of a regulated activity on interstate commerce is substantial, courts must look to the cumulative effect of all similar instances of the regulated activity, carried on in different places by different persons.  Lopez did not undermine this principle, which was articulated decades ago in Wickard v. Filburn.   To the contrary, the Lopez court categorically stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third branch of the commerce power would be negligible if its exercise were limited to particular incidents, each of which individually has a substantial effect upon the nation's commerce.  Under this straitened interpretation of congressional power, such clearly established uses of the commerce power as the mining legislation in Hodel and the civil rights legislation in McClung would be called into question.  As our court has noted, however, Lopez \"did not purport to eliminate or erode well-established Commerce Clause precedents.\"  Knutson, 113 F.3d at 29 (citing Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567-69, 115 S.Ct. at 1634).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a bedrock principle of modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence that Congress may regulate a category of activity whose many instances, taken together, substantially affect interstate commerce.  The Court explained this aggregation principle in McClung, a case involving a restaurant which bought meat from a local supplier who in turn was supplied from out of state.  The Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>It goes without saying that, viewed in isolation, the volume of food purchased at Ollie's Barbecue from sources supplied from out of state was insignificant when compared with the total foodstuffs moving in commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">379 U.S. at 300-01, 85 S.Ct. at 382.   The Court nonetheless found the requisite connection to interstate commerce, quoting the Wickard Court's reasoning for applying federal agricultural regulations to the production and consumption of homegrown wheat:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 301, 85 S.Ct. at 382 (quoting Wickard, 317 U.S. at 127-28, 63 S.Ct. at 90).   The same note was sounded by Justice Black, concurring in both McClung and Heart of Atlanta Motel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>[I]n deciding the constitutional power of Congress in cases like the two before us we do not consider the effect on interstate commerce of only one isolated, individual, local event, without regard to the fact that this single local event when added to many others of a similar nature may impose a burden on interstate commerce by reducing its volume or distorting its flow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">379 U.S. at 275, 85 S.Ct. at 367 (Black, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit relied on this aggregation principle to uphold the Hobbs Act against a Lopez-based challenge.  See United States v. Bolton, 68 F.3d 396, 399 (10th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 966, 133 L.Ed.2d 887 (1996).  The court observed that \"Lopez did not ... require the government to show that individual instances of the regulated activity substantially affect commerce....\"  Id. at 399.   The Tenth Circuit instead read Lopez as allowing for the application of federal law based on a de minimis nexus to interstate commerce, provided that the \"statute regulates an activity which, through repetition, in aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\"  Id. (internal citation omitted).  The court found that the Hobbs Act was such a statute and upheld its constitutionality.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the reasoning of Bolton unassailable.  We agree that under the third category of the commerce power described in Lopez, the particular conduct at issue in any given case need not have a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Congress is free to act--and the government to apply the law--so long as the regulated activity, in the aggregate, could reasonably be thought to substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's as-applied challenge to the Hobbs Act collapses in the face of the aggregation principle.  Every robbery or act of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act must have an effect on interstate commerce;  the Act's express jurisdictional element ensures this.  It follows with the inexorable logic of the multiplication table that the cumulative result of many Hobbs Act violations is a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Unlike gun possession in a school zone, robberies affecting interstate commerce are precisely the sort of acts \"that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect ... interstate commerce.\"   Cf. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567, 115 S.Ct. at 1634.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was evidence that the stores targeted by Robinson's gang were robbed of thousands of dollars and, moreover, that the robberies impaired their ability to cash out-of-state checks and to restock goods shipped from other states.  The jury necessarily found that this disruption amounted to an effect on interstate commerce.  We have no doubt that such disruptions, if repeated at retail stores across the nation, would amount to a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Accordingly, we reject appellant's claim that with respect to his intrastate activities, which may have affected interstate commerce less than substantially, the Act was unconstitutionally applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Related Prosecutorial and Trial Errors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant presents a final cluster of arguments relating to the supposed inadequacy of the indictment, proof, and jury instructions.  He contends that the indictment failed to allege that the subject robberies substantially affected interstate commerce.  He further contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Finally, he claims that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that such proof was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming these arguments have been preserved for review, they are entirely without merit.  Because a Hobbs Act robbery, viewed in isolation, need not have more than a minimal effect upon interstate commerce, appellant's arguments fall of their own weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's challenge to his firearm conviction was entirely derivative of his Hobbs Act arguments.  A conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) must be premised on the use or carrying of a firearm in connection with a crime subject to federal jurisdiction.  Robinson contends that because the underlying robberies were not constitutionally within the reach of federal law, his firearm conviction is invalid.  Our finding that the Hobbs Act was applied constitutionally disposes of this argument.  Accord Bolton, 68 F.3d at 399 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant urges reversal of his convictions on several additional grounds.  Having carefully considered the arguments in light of the record and the applicable law, we hold that no reversible error occurred.  We affirm on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. First Principles Revisited</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the profound issues raised by the Lopez decision, and in light of the guerilla campaign now being waged against federal statutes in the name of Lopez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we offer these concluding observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are acutely aware that the robbery of a neighborhood store, or even several such stores in one large city, is not the prototypical Hobbs Act violation.  As other courts have noted, the principal evil which inspired the passage of the Hobbs Act was, quite literally, highway robbery, especially those robberies committed by racketeers operating through labor unions.  See, e.g., United States v. Woodruff, 941 F.Supp. 910, 916-17 (N.D.Cal.1996) (internal citations omitted).  As the Eighth Circuit has aptly observed, the congressional authors of the Hobbs Act \"no doubt ... had in mind primarily offenses with a broad impact on interstate commerce, as opposed to local robberies normally prosecuted under state law[.]\"  Farmer, 73 F.3d at 843.   However, the reach of a statute is not determined by its authors' thoughts but by their words, and the text of the Hobbs Act \"in no way exclude[s] prosecutions for single local robberies,\" so long as the requirement of a nexus to interstate commerce is met.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eloquent voices have been raised against precisely this sort of federalization of the criminal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Among the familiar complaints are that the creation of new federal crimes burdens the federal courts, delaying civil trials;  that similarly situated defendants receive unequal procedural protections and sentences, depending on whether they are charged under state or federal law;  and that the expansion of federal jurisdiction impedes the ability of the states to innovate in the field of criminal justice.  Andrew Weis, Note, Commerce Clause in the Cross-Hairs, 48 STAN.L.REV. 1431, 1439-40 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the proliferation of federal crimes should be lamented or celebrated, however, is not for us to say.  The federal courts were not elected to represent the will of the people and ought not superintend congressional policy judgments.  Our opinion today does not address the wisdom of applying the Hobbs Act to local crimes that affect interstate commerce, but only the constitutionality of doing so.  In upholding the Act, we have relied on the analytical framework of Lopez, interpreted consistently with several decades of prior Commerce Clause decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, Lopez teaches two quite distinct lessons.  First, Lopez stands for the principle that certain activities, but not others, can be regulated under the Commerce Clause.  Lopez holds that the proper objects of the interstate commerce power are interstate commerce and those local activities which, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affect it.  The Court's elaboration of this point yielded the rules of decision which we employed, with little difficulty, in our analysis today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, more subtle lesson of Lopez is that there are \"outer limits\" to the commerce power, beyond which Congress may not trespass.  See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 555-57, 115 S.Ct. at 1628.   These limits exist because of the importance of the states in the structure of our federal system, and because of the disastrous consequences which would follow were we to \"obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local.\"  Id. at 557, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely how the lower federal courts are to police the outer boundary of the commerce power is left unsaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In particular, we do not yet know whether a statute which passes the substantial effect test of Lopez may nonetheless be struck down as intruding into areas traditionally managed by the states.  Previous judicial experiments in protecting the states from federal encroachment under the commerce power have a mixed record of success.  See National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976), overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.  Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985).  But see New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 176, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 2428, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992) (federal government cannot \"commandeer[ ] the legislative processes of the States....\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the circuit that struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act, we are acutely aware of the importance of protecting the integrity of the states and preventing the commerce power from becoming a national police power.  In our own cases, we have taken steps toward setting an outer limit on the commerce power by circumscribing the government's ability to prosecute crimes targeting private residences and individuals in their homes.  See United States v. Collins, 40 F.3d 95, 99 (5th Cir.1994) (holding interstate commerce nexus \"too attenuated\" where employee of national computer company was robbed at home);  see also United States v. Corona, 108 F.3d 565, 570 (5th Cir.1997) (casting doubt on sufficiency of commercial nexus in a federal arson prosecution based on a fire at a private home) (dicta ).  Nothing in today's decision forecloses the development of this line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these efforts, we recognize that there is a danger in the courts transforming a general axiom of federalism into a rule of decision to determine the outcome of particular cases.  A jurisprudence of undefined \"outer limits\" surely would repose too much discretion in the courts.  See, e.g., Woodruff, 941 F.Supp. at 913 (striking down Hobbs Act conviction in order \"to correct an imbalance in the scales of power\").  Our task as judges is not to go abroad in search of dragons to slay.  In this circuit, we shall apply the doctrinal rules articulated by Lopez and other binding precedents, albeit with a heightened sensitivity to potential federal incursions into the traditional sphere of state authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortunately, the case before us does not involve a federal law that intrudes into an area traditionally within the exclusive purview of the states.  This is not a case involving public education, domestic relations or municipal zoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Although this is a criminal case, the statute at issue was enacted to protect the nation's commerce from local threats which, in the aggregate, could substantially affect that commerce.  There is no usurpation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we uphold the Hobbs Act and its application to Robinson, confident that our decision does no violence to the principle of limited federal power articulated in Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION OF SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was sentenced on September 6, 1996, to 210 months imprisonment on the Hobbs Act counts and a consecutive term of 60 months on the firearm count.  See generally UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION, GUIDELINES MANUAL (1995).  He contends that the district court impermissibly enhanced his offense level based on the \"vulnerable victim\" guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1.  We agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement of the defendant's offense level for offenses against \"unusually vulnerable\" victims.  The applicable guideline states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct, increase by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, this section applies only if (1) a victim was unusually vulnerable because of age, physical or mental condition, or was \"otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct\";  and (2) the defendant actually knew or should have known of the victim's vulnerability or susceptibility.  See United States v. Castellanos, 81 F.3d 108, 110 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant received a \"vulnerable victim\" enhancement for each count of conviction.  His enhanced offense level for each count was then incorporated into the calculation of his sentence under the guidelines' rules for grouping multiple counts.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. D.  Robinson objected to each vulnerable victim enhancement in the court below and now appeals these adjustments to his offense level.  We review the district court's interpretation of the guidelines de novo;  we review a finding of unusual vulnerability for clear error and to determine whether the district court's conclusion was \"plausible in light of the record as a whole.\"  United States v. Scurlock, 52 F.3d 531, 541-42 (5th Cir.1995);  United States v. Brown, 7 F.3d 1155, 1160 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vulnerable victim enhancements in this case were proposed in the Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) prepared by the probation officer.  Prior to sentencing, appellant objected, contending that the victims in this case were not \"unusually vulnerable.\"   He pointed out that according to the guidelines commentary, \"a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of the teller's position in a bank.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b), comment., note 2.  Robinson argued that the merchants victimized in this case were analogous to the bank teller described in the commentary, and were distinguishable from the commentary's examples of unusually vulnerable victims--defrauded cancer patients and handicapped robbery victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an addendum to the PSR, the probation officer responded that the vulnerable victim enhancement was warranted.  She stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>The victims targeted in these offenses were Asian or Korean [sic] business people who were either the owners of a convenience store or some other business establishment which kept large amounts of cash.  The business establishments were in ethnic minority neighborhoods and cashed checks for people living in the neighborhood.  It is the probation office[']s position that these victims were more susceptible to this type of offense and were targeted for that reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, expressly adopting the probation officer's reasoning, held that Robinson \"knew or should have known that these robberies were being committed with the intention of preying upon Asian and Korean [sic] business people and that these individuals were selected because of their vulnerability.\"   The government seeks to uphold this enhancement on the ground that the Asian-American merchants targeted \"were not as 'street-savvy' or 'crime-conscious' \" as other merchants.  The government cites Thompson's testimony that Asian-Americans were perceived as careless in handling large sums of cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that these victims were \"unusually vulnerable.\"   The guidelines do not support the view that members of racial minority groups, in this case Asian-Americans, are unusually susceptible to crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Nor is a vulnerable victim enhancement appropriate on the basis of the victims' employment as merchants in stores that deal in a high volume of cash.  Under the guidelines, a vulnerable victim enhancement must stem from a personal trait or condition of the victim, rather than the position he occupies or his method of doing business.  \"Unless the criminal act is directed against the young, the aged, the handicapped, or unless the victim is chosen because of some unusual personal vulnerability, &#167; 3A1.1[b] cannot be employed.\"  United States v. Paige, 923 F.2d 112, 113 (8th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Application of the vulnerable victim guideline is limited to cases in which the victims \"are in need of greater societal protection\" and the offenses are thus \"more criminally depraved\" than they would be otherwise.  Castellanos, 81 F.3d at 111 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the victims were not selected because of any \"unusual personal vulnerability,\" nor were they in demonstrably greater need of societal protection than other crime victims.  To paraphrase the bank robber Willie Sutton, the victims' stores were targeted because that is where the money was.  Their possession of large amounts of cash and their perceived carelessness with it are not grounds for enhancement under the vulnerable victim guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether, in some circumstances, a victim's immigrant status or lack of street smarts might render him \"otherwise particularly susceptible\" to crime within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b).  The district court did not rely on this rationale, but on the fact that the victims were Asian-American merchants who handled large bankrolls.  A vulnerable victim enhancement based upon the victim's race, employment, and business habits, without more, cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Our holding aligns us with every other circuit that has addressed the issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We further hold that in Hobbs Act prosecutions based on local activities that affect interstate commerce, the government need not prove that the effect of an individual defendant's conduct was substantial.  It suffices to show a slight effect in each case, provided that the defendant's conduct is of a general type which, viewed in the aggregate, affects interstate commerce substantially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we affirm appellant's convictions, we vacate his sentence, which was erroneously enhanced on the ground that his victims, Asian-American merchants, were unusually vulnerable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring and early summer of 1995, several small businesses in the Dallas area were victimized in a series of crimes that became known as the \"driveway bank robberies.\"   The victims were owners and employees of liquor stores, convenience stores, and other retail and service establishments.  The stores provided check-cashing services;  the record reflects that the stores cashed out-of-state checks, payroll checks, and government benefit checks.  The record also reflects that several of the stores sold products that had been shipped to Texas from other states.  The victims testified that they suffered substantial business losses as a result of the robberies;  one store was forced to close permanently for lack of capital, and the others were unable to cash checks for a finite period of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The robberies were carried out through a relatively sophisticated technique known as \"jugging,\" in which the perpetrators reconnoitered the stores, learned their business routines, and struck immediately after the victims had made substantial bank withdrawals for use in cashing their customers' checks.  Typically the robberies took place in the commercial drive-up lane of the bank or in the parking lot of the store as the owner or employee returned with a cash withdrawal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An investigation by a violent crimes task force comprising FBI agents and Dallas police officers led to the arrest of the principal suspect, Ernest Thompson, on July 1, 1995.  Arrested with Thompson was the appellant, Anthony W. Robinson, who subsequently made several self-incriminating statements to investigators.  Thompson eventually pleaded guilty and testified for the prosecution at Robinson's trial.  A money-laundering charge against a third defendant was dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robinson was indicted on charges of conspiring to violate the Hobbs Act and aiding and abetting three robberies in violation of the Act.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951(a), 2.  The victims testified at trial that these robberies caused business losses of approximately $5,000 each to Maple Convenience Store and West End Liquors, and $60,000 to S &amp; S Foods.  Each Hobbs Act robbery count was accompanied by a count alleging that Robinson aided and abetted the possession of a firearm during a crime of violence.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c)(1), 2.  Two of the three firearm counts were dismissed by the district court.  Before trial, the government dismissed a separate count charging Robinson as principal in a fourth Hobbs Act robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a jury trial, Robinson was convicted on the remaining counts:  Hobbs Act conspiracy, aiding and abetting three Hobbs Act robberies, and aiding and abetting one firearm violation.  He was sentenced to a prison term of 210 months on the Hobbs Act counts and a consecutive 60-month term on the firearm count.  He appeals his convictions and his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II.

Lopez vividly reminds us that from time to time, the judiciary must intercede to assure that Congress does not, by enacting unconstitutional legislation under the guise of the commerce power, dramatically alter the balance of federalism.  We are also well aware of the arguments against shifting the primary responsibility for enacting and enforcing the criminal law from the states to the central government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, we recognize the broad sweep of Congress's constitutional authority \"[t]o regulate [c]ommerce ... among the several [s]tates,\" and its concomitant power to protect the nation's commerce by enacting such laws as it deems \"necessary and proper.\"  U.S. CONST. art.

This category extends beyond the regulation of highways, railroads, air routes, navigable rivers, fiber-optic cables and the like.  Under pre-Lopez precedents, Congress may legislate \"to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses....\"  Id.  (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v.

This branch of the commerce power thus provided a basis for the civil rights legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in public accommodations upheld in Heart of Atlanta Motel.   This category also is generally understood to encompass legislation aimed at preventing the misuse of the channels of commerce, such as statutes prohibiting interstate traffic in kidnapped persons, stolen goods, and prostitutes.

Lopez squarely held that under this third category, federal legislation concerning an intrastate activity is permissible only when the regulated activity \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce.

Lopez, 514 U.S. at 559-61, 115 S.Ct. at 1630.   The Court then analyzed the statute under the third category and found it constitutionally deficient for three reasons.  First, the Gun-Free School Zones Act had \"nothing to do with 'commerce' or any sort of economic activity, however broadly one might define those terms.\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31.   Because the possession of a gun near a school has no demonstrable effect on commerce, Congress could not rationally have concluded that the proscribed conduct, \"viewed in the aggregate,\" substantially affected interstate commerce.  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631.   Second, the Gun-Free School Zones Act did not contain an express jurisdictional element which would have \"ensure[d], through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearm possession in question affect[ed] interstate commerce.\"  Id. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631.   Finally, there were neither legislative findings nor a legislative history illuminating how Congress rationally could have determined that gun possession in school zones substantially affected interstate commerce.  Congressional findings, though not strictly required, might have revealed a constitutional basis for the legislation \"even though no ... substantial effect [upon interstate commerce] was visible to the naked eye....\"  Id. at 563, 115 S.Ct. at 1632.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think Lopez makes clear that legislation concerning an intrastate activity will be upheld if Congress could rationally have concluded that the activity, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce.  This standard will almost certainly be met if a statutory jurisdictional element ensures that an effect on interstate commerce must be proved in each case.  Even in the absence of such a statutory requirement, we will uphold the challenged statute if the regulated conduct's connection to interstate commerce is manifest, i.e., \"visible to the naked eye.\"   If we do not readily perceive a clear connection to interstate commerce, we may nevertheless uphold the statute if the nexus is satisfactorily explained by congressional findings or the legislative history.  Conversely, if the statute, the congressional findings, and the legislative history provide no rational basis for concluding that the regulated activity has the required nexus to interstate commerce, the statute must fall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Hobbs Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act imposes criminal penalties on anyone who \"in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce or the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion[,] or attempts or conspires so to do....\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(a).  The statutory definition of \"commerce\" is co-extensive with constitutional limits;  the Act defines \"commerce\" to include \"all commerce between any point in a State ... and any point outside thereof;  ...  and all other commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are thus two elements in a Hobbs Act prosecution:  (1) a robbery, act of extortion, or an attempt or conspiracy to rob or extort;  and (2) an interference with interstate commerce.

Moreover, a robbery or extortionate act that depletes the assets of a commercial enterprise, impairing or delaying its ability to buy goods or services in interstate commerce, satisfies the jurisdictional test.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span> (1956).  The question is whether the Act remains valid in light of its requirement of a de minimis effect on interstate commerce, or whether Lopez requires a substantial effect.  As explained below, we conclude that even if Lopez imposes a new requirement of substantiality, that requirement applies to the class of cases prosecuted in the aggregate;  in any particular case, proof of a slight effect on interstate commerce suffices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Constitutionality of the Hobbs Act under Lopez</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Hobbs Act differs from the late Gun-Free School Zones Act in critical respects.  The Gun-Free School Zones Act concerned an activity, gun possession in and near schools, which bore no evident relation to interstate commerce.  In contrast, the nexus between robbery and commerce is obvious:  a successful robbery results in the transfer of money or goods from the victim to the perpetrator.  Where, as in this case, the money belongs to commercial establishments engaged in interstate commercial transactions, the connection between the crime and interstate commerce is not difficult to discern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the Hobbs Act includes an express jurisdictional element of the sort conspicuously lacking in the Gun-Free School Zones Act.  This requirement explicitly limits the scope of the Hobbs Act to those robberies and extortion schemes which affect interstate commerce.  Compare Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561-63, 115 S.Ct. at 1631 (faulting the Gun-Free School Zones Act for the absence of an \"express jurisdictional requirement which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that ... have an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nonetheless invokes Lopez to challenge his Hobbs Act convictions on several grounds.  Appellant's terminology is none too precise, but we understand him to be making three distinct arguments.  First, he claims that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional on its face because it allows convictions on evidence of less than a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Second, he argues that the Act is unconstitutional as applied to a broad category of cases, including this one, involving local crimes whose effect on interstate commerce is less than substantial.  Finally, he argues that the indictment, evidence, and jury instructions were deficient because they did not adhere to the substantial effect requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Appellant's Facial Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For appellant to prevail on his claim that the Hobbs Act is facially unconstitutional, he must establish that there is no set of circumstances in which the Act could be applied constitutionally.  See Barnes v. Mississippi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606333\"><a href=\"/opinion/606333/helen-b-barnes-md-v-the-state-of-mississippi/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>, 1342 (5th Cir.)

That is, he must show that Congress could not rationally have determined that any single instance of robbery or extortion proscribed by the Act falls within the reach of its regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This places a heavy burden on the appellant.  \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is ... the most difficult challenge to mount successfully.\"  Webster v.

The mere possibility that the Act \"might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it wholly invalid....\"  Id.  (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to establish that the Hobbs Act is invariably unconstitutional in application by following the Supreme Court's reasoning in Lopez.   He claims that the Hobbs Act, like the Gun-Free School Zones Act, neither regulates the use of the channels of commerce nor protects persons and things in, or instrumentalities of, interstate commerce.  He then purports to explain why the Act cannot be applied constitutionally as a regulation of intrastate activities which substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is utterly misguided.  It relies on the unsupported assumption that the Hobbs Act can be applied constitutionally, if at all, solely under the third branch of the commerce power.  We think it obvious that in various factual settings, the Act proscribes conduct which Congress may reach under the first two branches of the commerce power.  For example, a Hobbs Act prosecution for hijacking a truck and its cargo on an interstate highway surely could be upheld under either the first or second branch of the commerce power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On that basis alone, appellant cannot meet his burden of establishing that the Hobbs Act is invariably unconstitutional in all factual circumstances.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Moreover, as we explain below, the Hobbs Act can be applied constitutionally under the third branch of the commerce power, given the requisite effect on interstate commerce.  Because there are circumstances in which the Hobbs Act operates constitutionally, we reject appellant's facial challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Appellant's As-Applied Challenge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main thrust of appellant's brief is that the Hobbs Act is unconstitutional as applied to intrastate activities, such as the subject robberies, which affect interstate commerce.  His theory with respect to this genus of Hobbs Act prosecutions is simple and rather elegant;  we view it also to be wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant contends that because a specific Hobbs Act conviction requires only an \"effect\" on interstate commerce, the Lopez requirement of a \"substantial effect\" in cases involving intrastate activity is not met.  The government responds that even if the substantial effect test applies, the Hobbs Act passes it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether the effect of a regulated activity on interstate commerce is substantial, courts must look to the cumulative effect of all similar instances of the regulated activity, carried on in different places by different persons.  Lopez did not undermine this principle, which was articulated decades ago in Wickard v. Filburn.   To the contrary, the Lopez court categorically stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>Where a general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558, 115 S.Ct. at 1629 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third branch of the commerce power would be negligible if its exercise were limited to particular incidents, each of which individually has a substantial effect upon the nation's commerce.  Under this straitened interpretation of congressional power, such clearly established uses of the commerce power as the mining legislation in Hodel and the civil rights legislation in McClung would be called into question.  As our court has noted, however, Lopez \"did not purport to eliminate or erode well-established Commerce Clause precedents.\"  Knutson, 113 F.3d at 29 (citing Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567-69, 115 S.Ct. at 1634).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a bedrock principle of modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence that Congress may regulate a category of activity whose many instances, taken together, substantially affect interstate commerce.  The Court explained this aggregation principle in McClung, a case involving a restaurant which bought meat from a local supplier who in turn was supplied from out of state.  The Court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>It goes without saying that, viewed in isolation, the volume of food purchased at Ollie's Barbecue from sources supplied from out of state was insignificant when compared with the total foodstuffs moving in commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">379 U.S. at 300-01, 85 S.Ct. at 382.   The Court nonetheless found the requisite connection to interstate commerce, quoting the Wickard Court's reasoning for applying federal agricultural regulations to the production and consumption of homegrown wheat:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>That appellee's own contribution to the demand for wheat may be trivial by itself is not enough to remove him from the scope of federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, taken together with that of many others similarly situated, is far from trivial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 301, 85 S.Ct. at 382 (quoting Wickard, 317 U.S. at 127-28, 63 S.Ct. at 90).   The same note was sounded by Justice Black, concurring in both McClung and Heart of Atlanta Motel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p>[I]n deciding the constitutional power of Congress in cases like the two before us we do not consider the effect on interstate commerce of only one isolated, individual, local event, without regard to the fact that this single local event when added to many others of a similar nature may impose a burden on interstate commerce by reducing its volume or distorting its flow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">379 U.S. at 275, 85 S.Ct. at 367 (Black, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tenth Circuit relied on this aggregation principle to uphold the Hobbs Act against a Lopez-based challenge.  See United States v. Bolton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"706115\"><a href=\"/opinion/706115/united-states-v-john-w-bolton-aka-gino/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span>, 399 (10th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">887</span></span> (1996).  The court observed that \"Lopez did not ... require the government to show that individual instances of the regulated activity substantially affect commerce....\"  Id. at 399.   The Tenth Circuit instead read Lopez as allowing for the application of federal law based on a de minimis nexus to interstate commerce, provided that the \"statute regulates an activity which, through repetition, in aggregate has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.\"  Id. (internal citation omitted).  The court found that the Hobbs Act was such a statute and upheld its constitutionality.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find the reasoning of Bolton unassailable.  We agree that under the third category of the commerce power described in Lopez, the particular conduct at issue in any given case need not have a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Congress is free to act--and the government to apply the law--so long as the regulated activity, in the aggregate, could reasonably be thought to substantially affect interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's as-applied challenge to the Hobbs Act collapses in the face of the aggregation principle.  Every robbery or act of extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act must have an effect on interstate commerce;  the Act's express jurisdictional element ensures this.  It follows with the inexorable logic of the multiplication table that the cumulative result of many Hobbs Act violations is a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Unlike gun possession in a school zone, robberies affecting interstate commerce are precisely the sort of acts \"that might, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect ... interstate commerce.\"   Cf. Lopez, 514 U.S. at 567, 115 S.Ct. at 1634.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, there was evidence that the stores targeted by Robinson's gang were robbed of thousands of dollars and, moreover, that the robberies impaired their ability to cash out-of-state checks and to restock goods shipped from other states.  The jury necessarily found that this disruption amounted to an effect on interstate commerce.  We have no doubt that such disruptions, if repeated at retail stores across the nation, would amount to a substantial effect upon interstate commerce.  Accordingly, we reject appellant's claim that with respect to his intrastate activities, which may have affected interstate commerce less than substantially, the Act was unconstitutionally applied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Related Prosecutorial and Trial Errors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant presents a final cluster of arguments relating to the supposed inadequacy of the indictment, proof, and jury instructions.  He contends that the indictment failed to allege that the subject robberies substantially affected interstate commerce.  He further contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove a substantial effect on interstate commerce.  Finally, he claims that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that such proof was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming these arguments have been preserved for review, they are entirely without merit.  Because a Hobbs Act robbery, viewed in isolation, need not have more than a minimal effect upon interstate commerce, appellant's arguments fall of their own weight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's challenge to his firearm conviction was entirely derivative of his Hobbs Act arguments.  A conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) must be premised on the use or carrying of a firearm in connection with a crime subject to federal jurisdiction.  Robinson contends that because the underlying robberies were not constitutionally within the reach of federal law, his firearm conviction is invalid.  Our finding that the Hobbs Act was applied constitutionally disposes of this argument.  Accord Bolton, 68 F.3d at 399 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant urges reversal of his convictions on several additional grounds.  Having carefully considered the arguments in light of the record and the applicable law, we hold that no reversible error occurred.

First Principles Revisited</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the profound issues raised by the Lopez decision, and in light of the guerilla campaign now being waged against federal statutes in the name of Lopez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> we offer these concluding observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are acutely aware that the robbery of a neighborhood store, or even several such stores in one large city, is not the prototypical Hobbs Act violation.  As other courts have noted, the principal evil which inspired the passage of the Hobbs Act was, quite literally, highway robbery, especially those robberies committed by racketeers operating through labor unions.  See, e.g., United States v. Woodruff, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span>, 916-17 (N.D.Cal.1996) (internal citations omitted).  As the Eighth Circuit has aptly observed, the congressional authors of the Hobbs Act \"no doubt ... had in mind primarily offenses with a broad impact on interstate commerce, as opposed to local robberies normally prosecuted under state law[.]\"  Farmer, 73 F.3d at 843.   However, the reach of a statute is not determined by its authors' thoughts but by their words, and the text of the Hobbs Act \"in no way exclude[s] prosecutions for single local robberies,\" so long as the requirement of a nexus to interstate commerce is met.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eloquent voices have been raised against precisely this sort of federalization of the criminal law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Among the familiar complaints are that the creation of new federal crimes burdens the federal courts, delaying civil trials;  that similarly situated defendants receive unequal procedural protections and sentences, depending on whether they are charged under state or federal law;  and that the expansion of federal jurisdiction impedes the ability of the states to innovate in the field of criminal justice.  Andrew Weis, Note, Commerce Clause in the Cross-Hairs, 48 STAN.L.REV. 1431, 1439-40 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the proliferation of federal crimes should be lamented or celebrated, however, is not for us to say.  The federal courts were not elected to represent the will of the people and ought not superintend congressional policy judgments.  Our opinion today does not address the wisdom of applying the Hobbs Act to local crimes that affect interstate commerce, but only the constitutionality of doing so.  In upholding the Act, we have relied on the analytical framework of Lopez, interpreted consistently with several decades of prior Commerce Clause decisions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, Lopez teaches two quite distinct lessons.  First, Lopez stands for the principle that certain activities, but not others, can be regulated under the Commerce Clause.  Lopez holds that the proper objects of the interstate commerce power are interstate commerce and those local activities which, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affect it.  The Court's elaboration of this point yielded the rules of decision which we employed, with little difficulty, in our analysis today.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second, more subtle lesson of Lopez is that there are \"outer limits\" to the commerce power, beyond which Congress may not trespass.  See Lopez, 514 U.S. at 555-57, 115 S.Ct. at 1628.   These limits exist because of the importance of the states in the structure of our federal system, and because of the disastrous consequences which would follow were we to \"obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local.\"  Id. at 557, 115 S.Ct. at 1629.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Precisely how the lower federal courts are to police the outer boundary of the commerce power is left unsaid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  In particular, we do not yet know whether a statute which passes the substantial effect test of Lopez may nonetheless be struck down as intruding into areas traditionally managed by the states.  Previous judicial experiments in protecting the states from federal encroachment under the commerce power have a mixed record of success.  See National League of Cities v.

In our own cases, we have taken steps toward setting an outer limit on the commerce power by circumscribing the government's ability to prosecute crimes targeting private residences and individuals in their homes.  See United States v. Collins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682459\"><a href=\"/opinion/682459/united-states-v-benny-lavern-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 99 (5th Cir.1994) (holding interstate commerce nexus \"too attenuated\" where employee of national computer company was robbed at home);  see also United States v.

Nothing in today's decision forecloses the development of this line of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite these efforts, we recognize that there is a danger in the courts transforming a general axiom of federalism into a rule of decision to determine the outcome of particular cases.  A jurisprudence of undefined \"outer limits\" surely would repose too much discretion in the courts.  See, e.g., Woodruff, 941 F.Supp. at 913 (striking down Hobbs Act conviction in order \"to correct an imbalance in the scales of power\").  Our task as judges is not to go abroad in search of dragons to slay.  In this circuit, we shall apply the doctrinal rules articulated by Lopez and other binding precedents, albeit with a heightened sensitivity to potential federal incursions into the traditional sphere of state authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortunately, the case before us does not involve a federal law that intrudes into an area traditionally within the exclusive purview of the states.  This is not a case involving public education, domestic relations or municipal zoning.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Although this is a criminal case, the statute at issue was enacted to protect the nation's commerce from local threats which, in the aggregate, could substantially affect that commerce.  There is no usurpation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we uphold the Hobbs Act and its application to Robinson, confident that our decision does no violence to the principle of limited federal power articulated in Lopez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. DISCUSSION OF SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant was sentenced on September 6, 1996, to 210 months imprisonment on the Hobbs Act counts and a consecutive term of 60 months on the firearm count.  See generally UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION, GUIDELINES MANUAL (1995).  He contends that the district court impermissibly enhanced his offense level based on the \"vulnerable victim\" guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1.  We agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 2-level enhancement of the defendant's offense level for offenses against \"unusually vulnerable\" victims.  The applicable guideline states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>If the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or that a victim was otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct, increase by 2 levels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, this section applies only if (1) a victim was unusually vulnerable because of age, physical or mental condition, or was \"otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct\";  and (2) the defendant actually knew or should have known of the victim's vulnerability or susceptibility.  See United States v. Castellanos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715881\"><a href=\"/opinion/715881/96-cal-daily-op-serv-2452-96-daily-journal-dar-4146-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 110 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant received a \"vulnerable victim\" enhancement for each count of conviction.  His enhanced offense level for each count was then incorporated into the calculation of his sentence under the guidelines' rules for grouping multiple counts.  See U.S.S.G. Ch. 3, Pt. D.  Robinson objected to each vulnerable victim enhancement in the court below and now appeals these adjustments to his offense level.  We review the district court's interpretation of the guidelines de novo;  we review a finding of unusual vulnerability for clear error and to determine whether the district court's conclusion was \"plausible in light of the record as a whole.\"  United States v. Scurlock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7144\"><a href=\"/opinion/7144/united-states-v-scurlock/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, 541-42 (5th Cir.1995);  United States v.

Prior to sentencing, appellant objected, contending that the victims in this case were not \"unusually vulnerable.\"   He pointed out that according to the guidelines commentary, \"a bank teller is not an unusually vulnerable victim solely by virtue of the teller's position in a bank.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b), comment., note 2.  Robinson argued that the merchants victimized in this case were analogous to the bank teller described in the commentary, and were distinguishable from the commentary's examples of unusually vulnerable victims--defrauded cancer patients and handicapped robbery victims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an addendum to the PSR, the probation officer responded that the vulnerable victim enhancement was warranted.  She stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>The victims targeted in these offenses were Asian or Korean [sic] business people who were either the owners of a convenience store or some other business establishment which kept large amounts of cash.  The business establishments were in ethnic minority neighborhoods and cashed checks for people living in the neighborhood.  It is the probation office[']s position that these victims were more susceptible to this type of offense and were targeted for that reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, expressly adopting the probation officer's reasoning, held that Robinson \"knew or should have known that these robberies were being committed with the intention of preying upon Asian and Korean [sic] business people and that these individuals were selected because of their vulnerability.\"   The government seeks to uphold this enhancement on the ground that the Asian-American merchants targeted \"were not as 'street-savvy' or 'crime-conscious' \" as other merchants.  The government cites Thompson's testimony that Asian-Americans were perceived as careless in handling large sums of cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the district court clearly erred in finding that these victims were \"unusually vulnerable.\"   The guidelines do not support the view that members of racial minority groups, in this case Asian-Americans, are unusually susceptible to crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Nor is a vulnerable victim enhancement appropriate on the basis of the victims' employment as merchants in stores that deal in a high volume of cash.  Under the guidelines, a vulnerable victim enhancement must stem from a personal trait or condition of the victim, rather than the position he occupies or his method of doing business.  \"Unless the criminal act is directed against the young, the aged, the handicapped, or unless the victim is chosen because of some unusual personal vulnerability, &#167; 3A1.1[b] cannot be employed.\"  United States v. Paige, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553950\"><a href=\"/opinion/553950/united-states-v-gary-paige/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 113 (8th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Application of the vulnerable victim guideline is limited to cases in which the victims \"are in need of greater societal protection\" and the offenses are thus \"more criminally depraved\" than they would be otherwise.  Castellanos, 81 F.3d at 111 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the victims were not selected because of any \"unusual personal vulnerability,\" nor were they in demonstrably greater need of societal protection than other crime victims.  To paraphrase the bank robber Willie Sutton, the victims' stores were targeted because that is where the money was.  Their possession of large amounts of cash and their perceived carelessness with it are not grounds for enhancement under the vulnerable victim guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether, in some circumstances, a victim's immigrant status or lack of street smarts might render him \"otherwise particularly susceptible\" to crime within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3A1.1(b).  The district court did not rely on this rationale, but on the fact that the victims were Asian-American merchants who handled large bankrolls.  A vulnerable victim enhancement based upon the victim's race, employment, and business habits, without more, cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

The Ninth Circuit and District of Columbia Circuit explicitly held the test inapplicable on the ground that the Hobbs Act regulated interstate, rather than intrastate, activities.  See Harrington, 108 F.3d at 1470;  Atcheson, 94 F.3d at 1242-43</p>\n        <p>These cases relied on the Supreme Court's holding that the substantial effect test governs only \"purely intrastate commercial activities that nonetheless have substantial interstate effects.\"  United States v.
