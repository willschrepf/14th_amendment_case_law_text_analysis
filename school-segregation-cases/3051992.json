Miller, Attorney General, and Kevin Cmelik and Grant\n\nDugdale, Assistant Attorneys General, for complainant.\n\n\n\n     Joseph R. Sevcik, Cedar Falls, pro se.\n\f                                        2\n\nCADY, Chief Justice.\n\n      The    Iowa   Commission     on       Judicial   Qualifications   filed   an\n\napplication for imposition of discipline against a part-time judicial\n\nmagistrate for misuse of expunged files.          The Commission found the\n\nmagistrate violated the Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct and recommended\n\nhe be publicly reprimanded. We grant the application and agree on our\n\nreview that the appropriate sanction for the magistrate’s conduct is a\n\npublic reprimand.\n\n      I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n      Joseph Sevcik has served as a part-time magistrate in Black Hawk\n\nCounty for nearly ten years. He has also practiced law in Iowa for more\n\nthan twenty-five years and maintains a law office in Cedar Falls.               We\n\nhave never disciplined Magistrate Sevcik as a judicial officer or as an\n\nattorney.\n\n      On November 5, 2013, Magistrate Sevcik, acting in his capacity as\n\na private attorney, represented a client in district court for a hearing on a\n\nmotion for temporary placement of a child.             Prior to the hearing, he\n\nretrieved four criminal and six domestic abuse court files from the office\n\nof the clerk of court. He had notified the clerk of court in advance that\n\nhe wanted the files and intended to ask the judge to take judicial notice\n\nof the contents of the file during the course of the hearing. Magistrate\n\nSevcik was uncertain whether he was on duty as a magistrate when he\n\nrequested the files, but was not on duty when he retrieved them from the\n\nclerk’s office.   He knew two of the criminal files included deferred\n\njudgments and had been expunged.                These files were marked as\n\nexpunged.     He understood the expunged files contained confidential\n\ndocuments and were only available to specific persons and agencies,\n\nincluding magistrates. Iowa Code §§ 907.4(2), .9(4)(b) (2013). Magistrate\n\f                                        3\n\nSevcik believed the district judge presiding over the hearing could take\n\njudicial notice of all the files, and he requested such judicial notice\n\nduring the hearing, placing them on the courtroom bench. In addition,\n\nMagistrate Sevcik used a document from one of the expunged files to\n\nimpeach a witness during the hearing.\n\n        The Commission found Magistrate Sevcik violated two of the\n\ncanons of judicial conduct with his actions. Specifically, the Commission\n\npinpointed rules 51:1.1, compliance with the law; 51:1.2, promote\n\nindependence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary while avoiding\n\nimpropriety; 51:1.3, abuse of judicial office to advance personal or\n\neconomic interests of the judge or others; and 51:3.5, intentional use of\n\nnonpublic information for a purpose unrelated to judicial duties.\n\n        The Commission recommended Magistrate Sevcik be publicly\n\nreprimanded. It relied on his candidness, his admission he should not\n\nhave requested or used the files, and his lack of prior discipline to\n\nmitigate    his   conduct.      Magistrate    Sevcik   requested    a   private\n\nadmonishment rather than a public reprimand.\n\n        II. Scope of Review.\n\n        It is our duty to discipline judicial officers for conduct violating the\n\ncanons of judicial ethics.      Iowa Code § 602.2106(3)(b); see also Iowa\n\nConst. art. V, § 19. We review recommendations for judicial discipline de\n\nnovo.    In re Block, 816 N.W.2d 362, 364 (Iowa 2012).             “The ethical\n\nviolation of a judge must be established by a convincing preponderance\n\nof the evidence.” In re Dean, 855 N.W.2d 186, 191 (Iowa 2014).\n\n        III. Violations.\n\n        The Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct applies to both judges and\n\npart-time magistrates, with some exceptions. See Iowa Code of Judicial\n\nConduct ch. 51, Application I, III. The exceptions recognize the leeway\n\f                                     4\n\nneeded for magistrates to balance their duties and responsibilities in the\n\npractice of law with the essential attributes of judicial service.       The\n\nexceptions carve out conduct relating to the judicial restrictions\n\ngoverning the practice of law, select extrajudicial activities, and public\n\nstatements concerning pending and impending cases when not serving\n\nas a judge. Id. Application III. Otherwise, the same canons of conduct\n\napplicable to Iowa judges apply to magistrates.             Additionally, the\n\napplicable canons and rules apply to magistrates even when they are\n\nwearing the hat of an attorney. In that respect, attorney-magistrates in\n\nIowa can be required to navigate through a host of challenges presented\n\nby these dual ethical obligations. They must be vigilant of both sets of\n\nrules and be cognizant of the critical importance of upholding both sets\n\nof standards.\n\n      The conduct of Magistrate Sevcik at issue in this case boils down\n\nto his actions in requesting and receiving two confidential court files from\n\na clerk of court, followed by his subsequent use of one of the files during\n\nhis cross-examination of a witness in a hearing before the district court\n\nin which he represented a party in the case. The question is whether his\n\nconduct violated rules 51:1.1, 51:1.2, 51:1.3, or 51:3.5.\n\n      A. Rule 51:1.1. Rule 51:1.1 provides that “[a] judge shall comply\n\nwith the law, including the Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct.” Id. r. 51:1.1.\n\nRead in the context of the broader canon sought to be upheld and\n\npromoted by rule 51:1.1, the rule addresses noncompliance with laws\n\nthat would undermine the independence, integrity, and impartiality of\n\nthe judiciary or project impropriety.      See id. Canon 1.         The rule\n\nspecifically identifies the code of judicial conduct as a part of the laws\n\ncovered by the rule, but not to make a violation of another judicial\n\nconduct rule a separate violation of its provisions. Cf. Iowa Supreme Ct.\n\f                                     5\n\nAtt’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Templeton, 784 N.W.2d 761, 769 (Iowa 2010)\n\n(“The purpose, however, of including [a rule requiring compliance with]\n\nthe Iowa Rules of Professional Conduct is to give notice to attorneys that\n\nthey are subject to discipline for violating the rules. The purpose of [the\n\nrule] was not to create a separate violation.” (Citation omitted.)). Instead,\n\nthis portion of the rule clarifies that all judges must comply with the\n\nrules of judicial conduct. See Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 556 U.S.\n\n868, 889–90, 129 S. Ct. 2252, 2266–67, 173 L. Ed. 2d 1208, 1225–26\n\n(2009) (indicating the integrity of the judiciary and the rule of law must\n\nbe upheld by all judicial officers). Thus, we must consider if the conduct\n\nof Magistrate Sevcik constituted noncompliance with the law.           If his\n\nconduct violated the law, we must further consider if the violation\n\nundermined the fundamental attributes of the judiciary sought to be\n\nprotected by Canon 1.\n\n      Under the law, a criminal record of a deferred judgment is\n\nexpunged following discharge from probation and payment of all financial\n\nobligations. Iowa Code § 907.9(4)(b). The record is then segregated by\n\nthe clerk of court in a secure area or database exempt from public\n\naccess.   Id. § 907.1(3).   The file becomes a confidential record exempt\n\nfrom public access under the open records law, but is available upon\n\nrequest to those agencies or persons granted access to the deferred\n\njudgment docket under section 907.4.         Id. § 907.9(4)(b).   A judicial\n\nmagistrate is a person given access to the deferred judgment docket. Id.\n\n§ 907.4(2).   The statute does not impose a further requirement that\n\naccess be limited to purposes related to judicial duties.           Thus, a\n\nmagistrate in Iowa may request and is entitled to access expunged files\n\ncontaining a deferred judgment.\n\f                                      6\n\n      As a result, Magistrate Sevcik did not violate the law by requesting\n\nand gaining access to the two expunged criminal files. Furthermore, the\n\nCommission did not identify any law he violated by using one of the\n\nexpunged files other than rule 51:3.5, involving the disclosure or use of\n\nnonpublic information for purposes unrelated to judicial duties.         See\n\nIowa Code of Judicial Conduct r. 51:3.5. We conclude Magistrate Sevcik\n\ndid not violate rule 51:1.1 and separately consider whether he violated\n\nrule 51:3.5.\n\n      B. Rule 51:3.5.     Rule 51:3.5 provides that “[a] judge shall not\n\nintentionally disclose or use nonpublic information acquired in a judicial\n\ncapacity for any purpose unrelated to the judge’s judicial duties.”       Id.\n\nTwo records obtained by Magistrate Sevcik had been expunged.            They\n\ncontained nonpublic information only available to Magistrate Sevcik\n\nbecause of his status as a magistrate.           See Iowa Code §§ 907.4(2),\n\n.9(4)(b). As such, the files constituted nonpublic information acquired in\n\nhis judicial capacity.   The remaining question is whether there was\n\nevidence of intentional disclosure or use of the information for a purpose\n\nunrelated to the judicial duties of the judge.\n\n      Magistrate Sevcik violated rule 51:3.5.        The record supports a\n\nfinding that he intentionally disclosed and used information in the\n\nexpunged files for purposes totally unrelated to his duties as a\n\nmagistrate. This intentional conduct was most evidenced in his use of\n\none of the files to cross-examine a witness. Additionally, he acquired the\n\nfiles from the clerk of court for purposes unrelated to his judicial duties.\n\n      C. Rule 51:1.2. Rule 51:1.2 requires judges to act “in a manner\n\nthat promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and\n\nimpartiality of the judiciary, and . . . avoid impropriety and the\n\nappearance of impropriety.”     Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct r. 51:1.2.\n\f                                                7\n\n“ ‘Integrity’     means       probity,       fairness,    honesty,   uprightness,        and\n\nsoundness of character.”             Id. Terminology.           “Impropriety” includes\n\n“conduct        that    undermines       a     judge’s    independence,     integrity,    or\n\nimpartiality.”         Id.   The rule focuses on conduct of a judge, not the\n\nsubjective intent of the judge.               In re Krull, 860 N.W.2d 38, 45 (Iowa\n\n2015).\n\n       A judge who acquires nonpublic information in a judicial capacity\n\nand uses the information for purposes unrelated to the judge’s judicial\n\nduties    can      undermine       the       judge’s     independence,    integrity,     and\n\nimpartiality. Here, the conduct by Magistrate Sevcik was in the nature of\n\nabuse of power and projected a willingness to misuse judicial authority\n\nto benefit his private practice of law. In this case, the violation of rule\n\n51:3.5 also constituted a violation of rule 51:1.2.\n\n       D. Rule 51:1.3. Rule 51:1.3 provides, “A judge shall not abuse\n\nthe prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic\n\ninterests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so.” Iowa Code of\n\nJudicial Conduct r. 51:1.3. A violation of the rule first requires conduct\n\nthat abuses “the prestige of judicial office.” Id. A judgeship is commonly\n\nviewed with prestige in society, and a judge must avoid purposely using\n\nthat prestige to gain special treatment or favoritism. As with the misuse\n\nof judicial authority, misuse of the prestige of judicial office can\n\nundermine the essential and fundamental qualities of a judge.                          In re\n\nMeldrum, 834 N.W.2d 650, 653 (Iowa 2013) (noting previously found\n\nabuses of prestige included selling private merchandise in chambers and\n\nidentifying self as a judge in advertisement for private attorney services);\n\nIn re Harned, 357 N.W.2d 300, 302 (Iowa 1984) (using judicial letterhead\n\nfor a letter to other magistrate judges about daughter’s traffic ticket);\n\nCharles Gardner Geyh, et al., Judicial Conduct and Ethics § 2.13, at 2-54\n\f                                        8\n\nto -64 (5th ed. 2013) (listing many possible abuses, including influencing\n\njudicial   proceedings    for   self   or   others,   evading   traffic   tickets,\n\nrecommendation abuses, and testifying before a jury).            As one judge\n\ndescribed it, this rule covers any “judge who in any manner gratuitously\n\ninterjects his or her judicial status in nonofficial dealings with law\n\nenforcement officials, school officials, insurance agents, neighbors,\n\njudges, or anyone else,” either through a specific request for favorable\n\ntreatment or when exploitation of the office can be inferred from the\n\ncircumstances.     Raymond J. McKoski, Judicial Discipline and the\n\nAppearance of Impropriety: What the Public Sees Is What the Judge Gets,\n\n94 Minn. L. Rev. 1914, 1970–71 (2010).\n\n      Yet, the rule recognizes that a violation requires the judge to\n\nengage in conduct that shows the judge is using or attempting to use the\n\nprestige of office. The lynchpin of the rule is judicial complicity.\n\n      In this case, there was insufficient evidence presented that\n\nMagistrate Sevcik projected the prestige of his office to gain access to the\n\nexpunged records or sought to use the prestige of his office.             To the\n\ncontrary, the clerk of court viewed the request by Magistrate Sevcik as\n\nany other request by a judge. Magistrate Sevcik did not display or use\n\nhis prestige of his judicial position to gain access, and the clerk\n\nconsidered Magistrate Sevcik to be exercising his legal authority to\n\nobtain the records.      Thus, his conduct did not constitute an abuse of\n\nprestige, but an abuse of authority previously addressed by rule 51:3.5.\n\n      IV. Sanction.\n\n      “The focus of sanctions in judicial disciplinary proceedings is not\n\nto punish the individual judge, but to restore and maintain the dignity,\n\nhonor, and impartiality of the judicial office, and to protect the public\n\nfrom further excesses.” In re McCormick, 639 N.W.2d 12, 16 (Iowa 2002).\n\f                                     9\n\n“The public must be protected, others must be deterred from similar\n\nmisconduct, and confidence in the judiciary must be vindicated.” In re\n\nEads, 362 N.W.2d 541, 551 (Iowa 1985).         As with attorney discipline\n\ncases, we do not have a standard sanction, but instead look to several\n\nfactors to impose the appropriate sanction for each individual case. In re\n\nMeldrum, 834 N.W.2d at 654. These factors include,\n\n      (a) whether the misconduct is an isolated instance or\n      evidenced a pattern of [mis]conduct; (b) the nature, extent\n      and frequency of occurrence of the acts of misconduct;\n      (c) whether the misconduct occurred in or out of the\n      courtroom; (d) whether the misconduct occurred in the\n      judge’s official capacity or in his [or her] private life;\n      (e) whether the judge has acknowledged or recognized that\n      the acts occurred; (f) whether the judge has evidenced an\n      effort to change or modify his [or her] conduct; (g) the length\n      of service on the bench; (h) whether there have been prior\n      complaints about this judge; (i) the effect the misconduct has\n      upon the integrity of and respect for the judiciary; and (j) the\n      extent to which the judge exploited his [or her] position to\n      satisfy [any] personal desires.\n\nIn re McCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 16 (alteration in original) (quoting In re\n\nDeming, 736 P.2d 639, 659 (Wash. 1987) (en banc)). We also consider\n\nthe sanctions imposed in similar cases. In re Krull, 860 N.W.2d at 46.\n\n      We have not been presented with a judicial discipline case similar\n\nto the facts of this case. In a recent judicial discipline case involving a\n\npart-time magistrate who failed to recuse himself from signing warrants\n\ndue to a conflict of interest, however, we imposed a public reprimand. Id.\n\nat 49–50. In a case in which a magistrate advertised his services as an\n\nattorney while noting he served as a magistrate, we again imposed a\n\npublic reprimand.    In re Meldrum, 834 N.W.2d at 654.       We have also\n\nimposed a public reprimand on a judge convicted of operation of a\n\nvehicle while intoxicated.   In re Block, 816 N.W.2d at 366.       We also\n\npublicly reprimanded a judge who participated in political activities and\n\f                                     10\n\nsubsequently made a false statement to the Commission regarding those\n\nactivities. In re McCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 17–18.\n\n       On the other hand, violations that harm public confidence in a\n\nmore severe way, such as intoxication while in the courtroom and\n\ncarrying on a campaign against a local attorney, have merited\n\nsuspensions. In re Dean, 855 N.W.2d at 188, 194 (imposing a thirty-day\n\nsuspension for holding court while intoxicated); In re Eads, 362 N.W.2d\n\nat 551 (imposing a sixty-day suspension for “institut[ing] and then\n\ncarr[ying] on an inexcusable campaign against a lawyer”). We have also\n\nsuspended a judge for using her office to request leniency for her\n\ndaughter’s speeding ticket.        In re Harned, 357 N.W.2d at 301–03\n\n(imposing a four-day suspension for using official stationery to write a\n\nletter and calling other magistrates to discuss her daughter’s speeding\n\nticket).\n\n       The Commission recommended a public reprimand.           Magistrate\n\nSevcik has requested a private admonishment.          “Where a violation\n\ninvolves conduct that is negligent in nature, with little known injury, an\n\nadmonition or a private reprimand is normally appropriate.           In re\n\nMcCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 17. But as we have noted before, “[o]nce we\n\ngrant an application in whole or in part, we are required to issue a\n\ndecree.    This decree is made public.”   In re Block, 816 N.W.2d at 366\n\n(footnote omitted). Last year in In re Krull, we considered the possibility\n\nof a public admonition as an intermediate sanction between a private\n\nadmonition and a public reprimand, noting the option was available if\n\nappropriate although we had never issued a public admonition in a\n\njudicial discipline application.   860 N.W.2d at 48 & n.4.    “We employ\n\nprofessional admonitions not so much by way of criticism as to\n\ninstruct . . . .”   Comm. on Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v. Liles, 430 N.W.2d\n\f                                   11\n\n111, 113 (Iowa 1988); see also In re Krull, 860 N.W.2d at 48.\n\nAdmonitions do not amount to discipline, but signal we do not condone\n\nthe conduct giving rise to the complaint. See Iowa Supreme Ct. Bd. of\n\nProf’l Ethics & Conduct v. Visser, 629 N.W.2d 376, 383 (Iowa 2001);\n\nComm. on Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v. Zimmermann, 522 N.W.2d 619, 621\n\n(Iowa 1994).\n\n      It is unnecessary for us to decide if we should adopt a public\n\nadmonition as a form of judicial discipline. Considering the nature of the\n\nconduct, this case does not present a need for us to provide instruction\n\nto magistrates on how to use their authority to access expunged records.\n\nThe misuse of authority in this case was not the result of a\n\nmisunderstanding, but a clear violation of the rule against using judicial\n\nauthority for purposes unrelated to the work of a magistrate.\n\n      We agree with the Commission that a public reprimand is the\n\nappropriate sanction.   It meets the goals of imposing sanctions and is\n\nsupported by the relevant circumstances in the case.\n\n      V. Conclusion.\n\n      We find Magistrate Joseph Sevcik violated Canons 1 and 3 of the\n\nIowa Code of Judicial Conduct as well as rules 51:1.2 and 51:3.5. We\n\nreprimand Magistrate Sevcik for his conduct.\n\n      APPLICATION GRANTED; JUDICIAL OFFICER REPRIMANDED.\n\f",

Miller, Attorney General, and Kevin Cmelik and Grant\n\nDugdale, Assistant Attorneys General, for complainant.\n\n\n\n     Joseph R. Sevcik, Cedar Falls, pro se.\n\f                                        2\n\nCADY, Chief Justice.\n\n      The    Iowa   Commission     on       Judicial   Qualifications   filed   an\n\napplication for imposition of discipline against a part-time judicial\n\nmagistrate for misuse of expunged files.          The Commission found the\n\nmagistrate violated the Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct and recommended\n\nhe be publicly reprimanded. We grant the application and agree on our\n\nreview that the appropriate sanction for the magistrate’s conduct is a\n\npublic reprimand.\n\n      I. Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n      Joseph Sevcik has served as a part-time magistrate in Black Hawk\n\nCounty for nearly ten years. He has also practiced law in Iowa for more\n\nthan twenty-five years and maintains a law office in Cedar Falls.               We\n\nhave never disciplined Magistrate Sevcik as a judicial officer or as an\n\nattorney.\n\n      On November 5, 2013, Magistrate Sevcik, acting in his capacity as\n\na private attorney, represented a client in district court for a hearing on a\n\nmotion for temporary placement of a child.             Prior to the hearing, he\n\nretrieved four criminal and six domestic abuse court files from the office\n\nof the clerk of court. He had notified the clerk of court in advance that\n\nhe wanted the files and intended to ask the judge to take judicial notice\n\nof the contents of the file during the course of the hearing. Magistrate\n\nSevcik was uncertain whether he was on duty as a magistrate when he\n\nrequested the files, but was not on duty when he retrieved them from the\n\nclerk’s office.   He knew two of the criminal files included deferred\n\njudgments and had been expunged.                These files were marked as\n\nexpunged.     He understood the expunged files contained confidential\n\ndocuments and were only available to specific persons and agencies,\n\nincluding magistrates. Iowa Code §§ 907.4(2), .9(4)(b) (2013). Magistrate\n\f                                        3\n\nSevcik believed the district judge presiding over the hearing could take\n\njudicial notice of all the files, and he requested such judicial notice\n\nduring the hearing, placing them on the courtroom bench. In addition,\n\nMagistrate Sevcik used a document from one of the expunged files to\n\nimpeach a witness during the hearing.\n\n        The Commission found Magistrate Sevcik violated two of the\n\ncanons of judicial conduct with his actions. Specifically, the Commission\n\npinpointed rules 51:1.1, compliance with the law; 51:1.2, promote\n\nindependence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary while avoiding\n\nimpropriety; 51:1.3, abuse of judicial office to advance personal or\n\neconomic interests of the judge or others; and 51:3.5, intentional use of\n\nnonpublic information for a purpose unrelated to judicial duties.\n\n        The Commission recommended Magistrate Sevcik be publicly\n\nreprimanded. It relied on his candidness, his admission he should not\n\nhave requested or used the files, and his lack of prior discipline to\n\nmitigate    his   conduct.      Magistrate    Sevcik   requested    a   private\n\nadmonishment rather than a public reprimand.\n\n        II. Scope of Review.\n\n        It is our duty to discipline judicial officers for conduct violating the\n\ncanons of judicial ethics.      Iowa Code § 602.2106(3)(b); see also Iowa\n\nConst. art. V, § 19. We review recommendations for judicial discipline de\n\nnovo.    In re Block, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364 (Iowa 2012).             “The ethical\n\nviolation of a judge must be established by a convincing preponderance\n\nof the evidence.” In re Dean, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 (Iowa 2014).\n\n        III. Violations.\n\n        The Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct applies to both judges and\n\npart-time magistrates, with some exceptions. See Iowa Code of Judicial\n\nConduct ch. 51, Application I, III. The exceptions recognize the leeway\n\f                                     4\n\nneeded for magistrates to balance their duties and responsibilities in the\n\npractice of law with the essential attributes of judicial service.       The\n\nexceptions carve out conduct relating to the judicial restrictions\n\ngoverning the practice of law, select extrajudicial activities, and public\n\nstatements concerning pending and impending cases when not serving\n\nas a judge. Id. Application III. Otherwise, the same canons of conduct\n\napplicable to Iowa judges apply to magistrates.             Additionally, the\n\napplicable canons and rules apply to magistrates even when they are\n\nwearing the hat of an attorney. In that respect, attorney-magistrates in\n\nIowa can be required to navigate through a host of challenges presented\n\nby these dual ethical obligations. They must be vigilant of both sets of\n\nrules and be cognizant of the critical importance of upholding both sets\n\nof standards.\n\n      The conduct of Magistrate Sevcik at issue in this case boils down\n\nto his actions in requesting and receiving two confidential court files from\n\na clerk of court, followed by his subsequent use of one of the files during\n\nhis cross-examination of a witness in a hearing before the district court\n\nin which he represented a party in the case. The question is whether his\n\nconduct violated rules 51:1.1, 51:1.2, 51:1.3, or 51:3.5.\n\n      A. Rule 51:1.1. Rule 51:1.1 provides that “[a] judge shall comply\n\nwith the law, including the Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct.” Id. r. 51:1.1.\n\nRead in the context of the broader canon sought to be upheld and\n\npromoted by rule 51:1.1, the rule addresses noncompliance with laws\n\nthat would undermine the independence, integrity, and impartiality of\n\nthe judiciary or project impropriety.      See id. Canon 1.         The rule\n\nspecifically identifies the code of judicial conduct as a part of the laws\n\ncovered by the rule, but not to make a violation of another judicial\n\nconduct rule a separate violation of its provisions. Cf. Iowa Supreme Ct.\n\f                                     5\n\nAtt’y Disciplinary Bd. v. Templeton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2119470\"><a href=\"/opinion/2119470/iowa-supreme-court-atty-disc-v-templeton/\"><span class=\"volume\">784</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769 (Iowa 2010)\n\n(“The purpose, however, of including [a rule requiring compliance with]\n\nthe Iowa Rules of Professional Conduct is to give notice to attorneys that\n\nthey are subject to discipline for violating the rules. The purpose of [the\n\nrule] was not to create a separate violation.” (Citation omitted.)). Instead,\n\nthis portion of the rule clarifies that all judges must comply with the\n\nrules of judicial conduct. See Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 889–90, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145867\"><a href=\"/opinion/145867/caperton-v-at-massey-coal-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Thus, we must consider if the conduct\n\nof Magistrate Sevcik constituted noncompliance with the law.           If his\n\nconduct violated the law, we must further consider if the violation\n\nundermined the fundamental attributes of the judiciary sought to be\n\nprotected by Canon 1.\n\n      Under the law, a criminal record of a deferred judgment is\n\nexpunged following discharge from probation and payment of all financial\n\nobligations. Iowa Code § 907.9(4)(b). The record is then segregated by\n\nthe clerk of court in a secure area or database exempt from public\n\naccess.   Id. § 907.1(3).   The file becomes a confidential record exempt\n\nfrom public access under the open records law, but is available upon\n\nrequest to those agencies or persons granted access to the deferred\n\njudgment docket under section 907.4.         Id. § 907.9(4)(b).   A judicial\n\nmagistrate is a person given access to the deferred judgment docket. Id.\n\n§ 907.4(2).   The statute does not impose a further requirement that\n\naccess be limited to purposes related to judicial duties.           Thus, a\n\nmagistrate in Iowa may request and is entitled to access expunged files\n\ncontaining a deferred judgment.\n\f                                      6\n\n      As a result, Magistrate Sevcik did not violate the law by requesting\n\nand gaining access to the two expunged criminal files. Furthermore, the\n\nCommission did not identify any law he violated by using one of the\n\nexpunged files other than rule 51:3.5, involving the disclosure or use of\n\nnonpublic information for purposes unrelated to judicial duties.         See\n\nIowa Code of Judicial Conduct r. 51:3.5. We conclude Magistrate Sevcik\n\ndid not violate rule 51:1.1 and separately consider whether he violated\n\nrule 51:3.5.\n\n      B. Rule 51:3.5.     Rule 51:3.5 provides that “[a] judge shall not\n\nintentionally disclose or use nonpublic information acquired in a judicial\n\ncapacity for any purpose unrelated to the judge’s judicial duties.”       Id.\n\nTwo records obtained by Magistrate Sevcik had been expunged.            They\n\ncontained nonpublic information only available to Magistrate Sevcik\n\nbecause of his status as a magistrate.           See Iowa Code §§ 907.4(2),\n\n.9(4)(b). As such, the files constituted nonpublic information acquired in\n\nhis judicial capacity.   The remaining question is whether there was\n\nevidence of intentional disclosure or use of the information for a purpose\n\nunrelated to the judicial duties of the judge.\n\n      Magistrate Sevcik violated rule 51:3.5.        The record supports a\n\nfinding that he intentionally disclosed and used information in the\n\nexpunged files for purposes totally unrelated to his duties as a\n\nmagistrate. This intentional conduct was most evidenced in his use of\n\none of the files to cross-examine a witness. Additionally, he acquired the\n\nfiles from the clerk of court for purposes unrelated to his judicial duties.\n\n      C. Rule 51:1.2. Rule 51:1.2 requires judges to act “in a manner\n\nthat promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and\n\nimpartiality of the judiciary, and . . . avoid impropriety and the\n\nappearance of impropriety.”     Iowa Code of Judicial Conduct r. 51:1.2.\n\f                                                7\n\n“ ‘Integrity’     means       probity,       fairness,    honesty,   uprightness,        and\n\nsoundness of character.”             Id. Terminology.           “Impropriety” includes\n\n“conduct        that    undermines       a     judge’s    independence,     integrity,    or\n\nimpartiality.”         Id.   The rule focuses on conduct of a judge, not the\n\nsubjective intent of the judge.               In re Krull, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (Iowa\n\n2015).\n\n       A judge who acquires nonpublic information in a judicial capacity\n\nand uses the information for purposes unrelated to the judge’s judicial\n\nduties    can      undermine       the       judge’s     independence,    integrity,     and\n\nimpartiality. Here, the conduct by Magistrate Sevcik was in the nature of\n\nabuse of power and projected a willingness to misuse judicial authority\n\nto benefit his private practice of law. In this case, the violation of rule\n\n51:3.5 also constituted a violation of rule 51:1.2.\n\n       D. Rule 51:1.3. Rule 51:1.3 provides, “A judge shall not abuse\n\nthe prestige of judicial office to advance the personal or economic\n\ninterests of the judge or others, or allow others to do so.” Iowa Code of\n\nJudicial Conduct r. 51:1.3. A violation of the rule first requires conduct\n\nthat abuses “the prestige of judicial office.” Id. A judgeship is commonly\n\nviewed with prestige in society, and a judge must avoid purposely using\n\nthat prestige to gain special treatment or favoritism. As with the misuse\n\nof judicial authority, misuse of the prestige of judicial office can\n\nundermine the essential and fundamental qualities of a judge.                          In re\n\nMeldrum, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 653 (Iowa 2013) (noting previously found\n\nabuses of prestige included selling private merchandise in chambers and\n\nidentifying self as a judge in advertisement for private attorney services);\n\nIn re Harned, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220935\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220935/matter-of-harned/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (Iowa 1984) (using judicial letterhead\n\nfor a letter to other magistrate judges about daughter’s traffic ticket);\n\nCharles Gardner Geyh, et al., Judicial Conduct and Ethics § 2.13, at 2-54\n\f                                        8\n\nto -64 (5th ed. 2013) (listing many possible abuses, including influencing\n\njudicial   proceedings    for   self   or   others,   evading   traffic   tickets,\n\nrecommendation abuses, and testifying before a jury).            As one judge\n\ndescribed it, this rule covers any “judge who in any manner gratuitously\n\ninterjects his or her judicial status in nonofficial dealings with law\n\nenforcement officials, school officials, insurance agents, neighbors,\n\njudges, or anyone else,” either through a specific request for favorable\n\ntreatment or when exploitation of the office can be inferred from the\n\ncircumstances.     Raymond J. McKoski, Judicial Discipline and the\n\nAppearance of Impropriety: What the Public Sees Is What the Judge Gets,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1914, 1970–71 (2010).\n\n      Yet, the rule recognizes that a violation requires the judge to\n\nengage in conduct that shows the judge is using or attempting to use the\n\nprestige of office. The lynchpin of the rule is judicial complicity.\n\n      In this case, there was insufficient evidence presented that\n\nMagistrate Sevcik projected the prestige of his office to gain access to the\n\nexpunged records or sought to use the prestige of his office.             To the\n\ncontrary, the clerk of court viewed the request by Magistrate Sevcik as\n\nany other request by a judge. Magistrate Sevcik did not display or use\n\nhis prestige of his judicial position to gain access, and the clerk\n\nconsidered Magistrate Sevcik to be exercising his legal authority to\n\nobtain the records.      Thus, his conduct did not constitute an abuse of\n\nprestige, but an abuse of authority previously addressed by rule 51:3.5.\n\n      IV. Sanction.\n\n      “The focus of sanctions in judicial disciplinary proceedings is not\n\nto punish the individual judge, but to restore and maintain the dignity,\n\nhonor, and impartiality of the judicial office, and to protect the public\n\nfrom further excesses.” In re McCormick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2010388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2010388/in-re-inquiry-concerning-mcmormick/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (Iowa 2002).\n\f                                     9\n\n“The public must be protected, others must be deterred from similar\n\nmisconduct, and confidence in the judiciary must be vindicated.” In re\n\nEads, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1708412\"><a href=\"/opinion/1708412/matter-of-inquiry-concerning-eads/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (Iowa 1985).         As with attorney discipline\n\ncases, we do not have a standard sanction, but instead look to several\n\nfactors to impose the appropriate sanction for each individual case. In re\n\nMeldrum, 834 N.W.2d at 654. These factors include,\n\n      (a) whether the misconduct is an isolated instance or\n      evidenced a pattern of [mis]conduct; (b) the nature, extent\n      and frequency of occurrence of the acts of misconduct;\n      (c) whether the misconduct occurred in or out of the\n      courtroom; (d) whether the misconduct occurred in the\n      judge’s official capacity or in his [or her] private life;\n      (e) whether the judge has acknowledged or recognized that\n      the acts occurred; (f) whether the judge has evidenced an\n      effort to change or modify his [or her] conduct; (g) the length\n      of service on the bench; (h) whether there have been prior\n      complaints about this judge; (i) the effect the misconduct has\n      upon the integrity of and respect for the judiciary; and (j) the\n      extent to which the judge exploited his [or her] position to\n      satisfy [any] personal desires.\n\nIn re McCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 16 (alteration in original) (quoting In re\n\nDeming, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1428733\"><a href=\"/opinion/1428733/in-re-disciplinary-proceeding-against-deming/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659 (Wash. 1987) (en banc)). We also consider\n\nthe sanctions imposed in similar cases. In re Krull, 860 N.W.2d at 46.\n\n      We have not been presented with a judicial discipline case similar\n\nto the facts of this case. In a recent judicial discipline case involving a\n\npart-time magistrate who failed to recuse himself from signing warrants\n\ndue to a conflict of interest, however, we imposed a public reprimand. Id.\n\nat 49–50. In a case in which a magistrate advertised his services as an\n\nattorney while noting he served as a magistrate, we again imposed a\n\npublic reprimand.    In re Meldrum, 834 N.W.2d at 654.       We have also\n\nimposed a public reprimand on a judge convicted of operation of a\n\nvehicle while intoxicated.   In re Block, 816 N.W.2d at 366.       We also\n\npublicly reprimanded a judge who participated in political activities and\n\f                                     10\n\nsubsequently made a false statement to the Commission regarding those\n\nactivities. In re McCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 17–18.\n\n       On the other hand, violations that harm public confidence in a\n\nmore severe way, such as intoxication while in the courtroom and\n\ncarrying on a campaign against a local attorney, have merited\n\nsuspensions. In re Dean, 855 N.W.2d at 188, 194 (imposing a thirty-day\n\nsuspension for holding court while intoxicated); In re Eads, 362 N.W.2d\n\nat 551 (imposing a sixty-day suspension for “institut[ing] and then\n\ncarr[ying] on an inexcusable campaign against a lawyer”). We have also\n\nsuspended a judge for using her office to request leniency for her\n\ndaughter’s speeding ticket.        In re Harned, 357 N.W.2d at 301–03\n\n(imposing a four-day suspension for using official stationery to write a\n\nletter and calling other magistrates to discuss her daughter’s speeding\n\nticket).\n\n       The Commission recommended a public reprimand.           Magistrate\n\nSevcik has requested a private admonishment.          “Where a violation\n\ninvolves conduct that is negligent in nature, with little known injury, an\n\nadmonition or a private reprimand is normally appropriate.           In re\n\nMcCormick, 639 N.W.2d at 17. But as we have noted before, “[o]nce we\n\ngrant an application in whole or in part, we are required to issue a\n\ndecree.    This decree is made public.”   In re Block, 816 N.W.2d at 366\n\n(footnote omitted). Last year in In re Krull, we considered the possibility\n\nof a public admonition as an intermediate sanction between a private\n\nadmonition and a public reprimand, noting the option was available if\n\nappropriate although we had never issued a public admonition in a\n\njudicial discipline application.   860 N.W.2d at 48 & n.4.    “We employ\n\nprofessional admonitions not so much by way of criticism as to\n\ninstruct . . . .”   Comm. on Prof’l Ethics & Conduct v.

It meets the goals of imposing sanctions and is\n\nsupported by the relevant circumstances in the case.\n\n      V.
