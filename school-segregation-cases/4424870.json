The judg-\nment of the circuit court is affirmed in part and reversed\nin part, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for\nresentencing.\n    Case Summary: Defendant, who was convicted of felony public indecency\nbased on incidents during which he exposed his genitals in public, argued that\nthe sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole imposed for\nthose convictions violated Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution, which\nrequires that all penalties be proportioned to the offense. Held: Under the cir-\ncumstances of this case, the penalty of life imprisonment without the possibility\nof parole was unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I, section 16, of\nthe Oregon Constitution.\n    The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed. The judgment of the circuit\ncourt is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded to the\ncircuit court for resentencing.\n\f372\t                                                    State v. Davidson\n\n\t          BREWER, J.\n\t         Defendant was convicted of two counts of public\nindecency under ORS 163.465 for exposing himself at a\npublic park; because he had two prior felony convictions for\npublic indecency, and the trial court found no ground for\ndownward departure, defendant was sentenced consecu-\ntively on each count to life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole under ORS 137.719(1).1 The Court of Appeals\naffirmed defendant’s convictions but held that the sentences\nviolated Article I, section 16, of the Oregon Constitution,\nwhich provides that all penalties shall be proportioned to\nthe offense.2 State v. Davidson, 271 Or App 719, 353 P3d 2\n(2015). Defendant sought review in this court, arguing that\nthe Court of Appeals erred in upholding his convictions. The\nstate also sought review, asserting, first, that defendant’s\nsentences are unreviewable because they are “presumptive”\nsentences and, second, that the sentences were not unconsti-\ntutionally disproportionate in light of the facts of this case\nand the circumstances of defendant’s previous crimes. We\nallowed both petitions. As explained below, we affirm defen-\ndant’s convictions, but we conclude that the sentences are\nunconstitutionally disproportionate as applied to defendant.\nAccordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals,\nand we reverse defendant’s sentences and remand to the cir-\ncuit court for resentencing.\n\t        This case presents some of the same issues that we\nrecently addressed in State v. Althouse, 359 Or 668, 375 P3d\n475 (2016). Althouse, in fact, forecloses the state’s review-\nability argument, and we therefore reject that argument\nwithout further discussion. See id. at 678 (holding that\nORS 138.222(2)(a) does not preclude review of sentence\nof life imprisonment without possibility of parole imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719). In addition to its reviewability\n\t1\n     ORS 137.719(1) provides:\n \t     “The presumptive sentence for a sex crime that is a felony is life impris-\n onment without the possibility of release or parole if the defendant has been\n sentenced for sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the cur-\n rent sentence.”\n\t2\n     Article I, section 16, provides, in part:\n “Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted, but all penalties shall\n be proportioned to the offense.”\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t373\n\nholding, Althouse set out a framework for the consideration of\nas-applied constitutional challenges to sentences imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719. Accordingly, we first address\ndefendant’s challenge to his underlying convictions under\nORS 163.465 and then evaluate the constitutionality of\nthe life sentences imposed for those convictions under the\nframework set out in Althouse.\n       I.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA.  Current Convictions\n\t        Because the jury found defendant guilty of the cur-\nrent charges, we view the evidence presented at trial in\nthe light most favorable to the state. State v. Agee, 358 Or\n325, 327, 364 P3d 971 (2015). A group of women and chil-\ndren were having lunch in a park in Salem when defendant\nwalked by and waved at them. After the older children left\nthe group to play on a nearby play structure, a man came by\nand told the group that defendant was behind a nearby tree.\nOne of the women, Davis, looked over her shoulder and could\nsee defendant peeking out at her from behind the tree.\n\t        When Davis stood up and turned, she was able to\nsee that defendant was exposing his genitals and mastur-\nbating. Davis called 9-1-1 and gathered her group together\nto return to their car. As they left, defendant approached\nand told Davis several times that he was leaving; he then\nleft through the south end of the park. Responding offi-\ncers searched the area to the south of the park and found\ndefendant standing at a fence bordering the park, looking\ninto the park. As the officers approached defendant, they\ncould see that he had his pants open and was masturbat-\ning. Defendant was then arrested and subsequently charged\nwith and convicted by a jury of two counts of public inde-\ncency, one count for the incident near Davis’s group and the\nother count for the incident at the border of the park shortly\nbefore he was apprehended.\nB.  Prior Public Indecency Convictions\n\t        Defendant’s prior convictions for public indecency\nwere relevant to his sentencing on his current convic-\ntions, because the prior convictions elevated those offenses\n\f374\t                                                      State v. Davidson\n\nfrom misdemeanors to felony public indecency. See ORS\n163.465(2).3 In the guilt phase of the trial in this case, for\nthe purpose of establishing that the current offenses were\nproperly charged as Class C felony offenses, defendant\nstipulated to the existence of three prior public indecency\nconvictions. The details of defendant’s prior convictions, as\ndescribed below, were presented in a presentence investiga-\ntion report in the course of the sentencing proceeding.4\n\t        In 2006, defendant was convicted of the crime of\nmisdemeanor public indecency and placed on probation.\nThat offense occurred when defendant was observed by a\nneighbor while defendant was standing on the porch of a\nhouse and masturbating. When defendant saw the neighbor,\nhe called out to her, “you want some of this?” as he continued\nto masturbate. The neighbor called the police. Nobody was\nhome at the house when the incident occurred, but, when\nquestioned by the police, defendant claimed to have been\nvisiting “Amy” at the house and suggested that he had some\nsort of intimate relationship with “Amy.” Defendant even\ndescribed some items inside the house. The police later con-\ntacted the homeowner, who was not named “Amy,” and she\ndenied knowing defendant. The police also discovered that\ndefendant’s grandmother lived near the house where the\noffense occurred, that defendant had stayed with his grand-\nmother at some point in time, and that his grandmother\nhad entered his bedroom and discovered him masturbating\nwhile looking out the window toward the house where the\noffense later occurred. Finally, the police located a letter in\ndefendant’s backpack written by defendant to another per-\nson, stating that he had a crush on her and had watched her\nmow her lawn. The woman who owned the house where the\noffense occurred acknowledged that she regularly mowed the\n\t3\n        ORS 163.465(2) provides:\n    \t     “(a)  Public indecency is a Class A misdemeanor.\n    \t     “(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, public indecency\n    is a Class C felony if the person has a prior conviction for public indecency or\n    a crime described in ORS 163.355 to 163.445 or for a crime in another juris-\n    diction that, if committed in this state, would constitute public indecency or\n    a crime described in ORS 163.355 to 163.445.”\n\t4\n        At sentencing, defendant also made a personal statement to the court, but\nneither party presented additional evidence beyond what was contained in the\npresentence investigation report.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t375\n\nlawn around her house. The woman subsequently obtained\na stalking protective order against defendant.\n\t        Defendant was convicted of misdemeanor public\nindecency arising out of the incident on the porch, and he\nwas sentenced to probation for that offense. Several months\nlater, while defendant was on probation for that offense,\na number of school staff members reported that they had\nobserved defendant expose his genitals while masturbating\nnear an elementary school playground. One of those staff\nmembers indicated that, when defendant saw her looking at\nhim through a window, he turned to face her as if he wanted\nher to observe him. Three children also saw defendant near\nthe school, although the record did not indicate whether\nthey saw him expose his genitals. Defendant was convicted\nof public indecency for that conduct, and, because he had a\nprior misdemeanor public indecency conviction, his convic-\ntion for the school incident was elevated to a felony under\nORS 163.465(2). Defendant served a 28-month prison sen-\ntence for that conviction.\n\t        Shortly after defendant was released from prison on\nhis sentence for the school incident, defendant again was\narrested for and convicted of felony public indecency. In that\nincident, a group of women (who had a child with them) were\nnear their car in a store parking lot when they observed\ndefendant looking at them while he exposed his genitals\nand masturbated. When the police arrived, an officer also\nobserved defendant masturbating in the parking lot. After\ndefendant was apprehended, he told the police that he had\nbeen masturbating inside a nearby pornography shop and\nthat he had masturbated in front of the women after he left\nthe store because he thought that it would make the women\n“hot” and that he would be able to get a “date.”\nC.  Other Prior Convictions and Misconduct\n\t        In evaluating disproportionality challenges to crim-\ninal sentences, it is appropriate for a court to consider any\nprior conviction, as well as misconduct that did not result\nin convictions. Althouse, 359 Or at 679; State v. Rodriguez/\nBuck, 347 Or 46, 78, 217 P3d 659 (2009). In the present case,\nthe presentence investigation report indicated that defen-\ndant first came into contact with police at age 10, when he\n\f376\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nwas accused of shoplifting a toy.5 He was first referred to\nthe juvenile court at age 14 based on a fighting incident at\nhis junior high school; that referral was disposed of infor-\nmally. When he was in his late teens and early twenties,\ndefendant had numerous contacts with law enforcement,\nprimarily involving possession of controlled substances. He\nalso was arrested twice for battery based on fights with his\ngirlfriend, but those charges were dismissed. He was con-\nvicted on one occasion of trespass and investigated for tres-\npass based on several other incidents, some of which arose\nin conjunction with the public indecency incidents described\nabove. Defendant also had a single prior conviction for driv-\ning while suspended.\n\t        Most of defendant’s convictions for offenses other\nthan public indecency resulted in probationary sentences.\nThe record shows that defendant consistently performed\npoorly on probation and post-prison supervision, regularly\ncommitting new offenses while under supervision, as well\nas failing to appear at various hearings concerning proba-\ntion violations. While incarcerated, defendant received sanc-\ntions for misconduct (generally for disobedience) on numer-\nous occasions. Defendant has been diagnosed with various\nsubstance dependence disorders, as well as with a cognitive\ndisorder due to a traumatic brain injury that occurred when\nhe was a teenager.\nD.  Sentencing\n\t         At defendant’s sentencing, the state argued that\na sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole was appropriate, noting in particular that defen-\ndant’s first two public indecency offenses were committed in\na brief time interval, that the third offense occurred within\ndays after he was released from prison on the prior offenses,\nand that the current crimes also occurred within days of his\nrelease from prison for the third offense. For the most part,\nthe state’s focus at sentencing was not on the specifics of\nany of the public indecency offenses themselves (other than\n\n\t5\n       Defendant does not challenge the trial court’s consideration of evidence of\nhis prior misconduct and other criminal offenses contained in the presentence\ninvestigation report.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t377\n\nnoting that they caused harm to the victims), but rather on\ndefendant’s recidivism.\n\t        In response, defense counsel emphasized the fact\nthat none of defendant’s offenses involved violence or physi-\ncal contact with anyone; he argued that a life sentence with-\nout the possibility of parole is simply too harsh a punishment\nfor masturbating in public, even for a repeat offender. In his\nown statement at sentencing, defendant showed little or no\nunderstanding that society views his public sexual behavior\nas unacceptable.6\n\t        The circuit court noted that, under ORS 137.719, the\npresumptive sentences for defendant’s current convictions\nwere life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and\nconcluded that it could not identify any mitigating factor that\nwould justify downward departures from those presumptive\nsentences.7 Accordingly, the court sentenced defendant to\nconsecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole\non the current convictions.\nE.  Appeal\n\t        Defendant appealed, arguing that (1) his convic-\ntions should be reversed because the trial court had erred\nin failing to give a requested jury instruction on attempted\npublic indecency; and (2) his sentences should be reversed\nbecause the life sentences without the possibility of parole\nthat the court imposed were unconstitutionally dispropor-\ntionate under Article I, section 16. Defendant did not argue\nthat ORS 137.719 is facially unconstitutional. Rather, he\nasserted that the application of that statute in the present\ncircumstances was unconstitutional under Article I, sec-\ntion 16, because the penalty was disproportionate to the\n\t6\n        Defendant’s statements were consistent with the opinions of several mental\nhealth professionals who had evaluated him over the years. For example, the\nreport of defendant’s 2009 mental health evaluation states:\n     “He has obviously distorted sexual attitudes and opinions, believing that\n     women might be attracted to him by masturbating in public in their presence.”\n\t7\n        Defendant did not assert before the circuit court, nor has he asserted on\nappeal or review, that his mental health circumstances, including his apparent\nlack of appreciation for the criminality of his conduct, amount to a mitigating fac-\ntor in assessing the proportionality of his sentences. We therefore do not consider\nthat issue here.\n\f378\t                                           State v. Davidson\n\noffense. Defendant emphasized that public indecency his-\ntorically has been a misdemeanor offense under Oregon law,\nsee ORS 161.615(1) (maximum term of imprisonment for\nhighest-level misdemeanor offense is one year), and he urged\nthat the penalties imposed in this case were disproportion-\nate in comparison to sentences for other offenses of similar\nor greater gravity.\n\t        The Court of Appeals rejected defendant’s jury\ninstruction argument without discussion, but it agreed with\ndefendant that, as applied to his circumstances, the life sen-\ntences imposed on the two convictions for public indecency\nwere unconstitutionally disproportionate and, therefore,\nreversed those sentences and remanded to the circuit court\nfor resentencing. Davidson, 271 Or App at 721 n 4, 745.\n\t       The state sought review of the Court of Appeals’\ndecision with respect to defendant’s sentences, and defen-\ndant sought review of the Court of Appeals’ disposition of\nhis assignment of error relating to the jury instruction.\nWe granted both petitions for review, and, for the reasons\nexplained below, we affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals with respect to both issues.\n             II.  CHALLENGE TO DEFENDANT’S\n                       CONVICTIONS\n\t        We first consider defendant’s challenge to his con-\nvictions. ORS 163.465(1) provides:\n   \t “A person commits the crime of public indecency if while\n   in, or in view of, a public place the person performs:\n   \t   “(a)  An act of sexual intercourse;\n   \t   “(b)  An act of deviate sexual intercourse; or\n   \t “(c)  An act of exposing the genitals of the person with\n   the intent of arousing the sexual desire of the person or\n   another person.”\nDefendant was charged under paragraph (c) of that statute.\n\t        At trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquit-\ntal, arguing that the state was required to prove that, when\nhe exposed himself, he intended other people to see what he\nwas doing, and asserting that a person who surreptitiously\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t379\n\nmasturbates in a public place but does not intend to be\nviewed by others does not violate that statute. That is, defen-\ndant argued, the state was required to prove that defendant\nexposed his genitals with the intent to arouse sexual desire\nby being seen exposing himself in public, not simply that he\nexposed his genitals intending to arouse sexual desire and\nthat that act occurred in, or view of, a public place. The trial\ncourt denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\t        Subsequently, in a colloquy regarding jury instruc-\ntions, defense counsel requested an instruction on attempted\npublic indecency, arguing: “[I]n this case, because especially\nin count two, or the second time [defendant] encountered\nsomeone else, no one else was around to see him and when\nhe was seen, he fled. It could be seen as an attempt[.]” When\nthe trial court asked for further clarification about how the\nevidence could support an attempt conviction, counsel indi-\ncated that the instruction could potentially apply to both\ncounts, adding: “Well, because ‘exposed,’ your Honor, can be\na couple of things. The fact that [Davis] had to get up and\nadjust her viewpoint to see what was going on, [defendant]\nwas not putting himself on display.” Defense counsel did not\nspecify precisely how he wanted the jury to be instructed\non attempted public indecency, but it is apparent from the\nquoted colloquy that he sought the “attempt” instruction\nas a basis for arguing to the jury that the state’s evidence\nwas insufficient to prove that defendant was trying to be\nobserved when he committed the “act of exposing the gen-\nitals” described in ORS 163.465(1)(c), an argument similar\nto the one that he had made in support of the motion for\njudgment of acquittal.\n\t        “A party is generally entitled to a jury instruction\nbased on its theory of the case if the instruction is war-\nranted by the particular facts and correctly states the law.”\nState v. Washington, 355 Or 612, 653, 330 P3d 596 (2014).\nWe presume that defendant wanted a standard instruction\non “attempt” that followed the text of the attempt statute\nand thus would have been a correct statement of the law.\nUnder ORS 161.405(1), an attempt crime occurs when a per-\nson “intentionally engages in conduct that constitutes a sub-\nstantial step toward commission of the crime.” The conduct\n\f380\t                                                      State v. Davidson\n\nthat constitutes the substantial step must “(1) advance the\ncriminal purpose charged and (2) provide some verification\nof the existence of that purpose.” State v. Walters, 311 Or 80,\n85, 804 P2d 1164 (1991). In sum, an attempt instruction is\nappropriate when the evidence could support a finding that\nthe defendant specifically intended to commit a crime and\ntook a substantial step toward doing so, but did not complete\nthe crime.\n\t        Defendant’s argument in this case, by contrast, was\nnot that the evidence permitted an inference that he intended\nto carry out the charged offenses of public indecency but did\nnot complete them. Rather, his argument was that the state\nwas required to prove that he intended to arouse himself\nby being observed exposing himself in public, and the state\nfailed to prove that he had the requisite intent to commit the\ncrimes at all. Stated differently, defendant’s theory was that\nno public indecency crime was committed because he lacked\nthe requisite intent to commit that offense.\n\t        So understood, an attempt instruction based on\nORS 161.405 would not have advanced defendant’s theory\nof the case. If defendant’s theory were correct, he would not\nhave been guilty of either an attempt—in that he would\nhave lacked the requisite specific intent to carry out that\noffense—or the completed offense. Accordingly, even assum-\ning that defendant’s theory of the case was sound—an issue\nthat we do not reach in this case—an attempt instruction\nwould not have been an appropriate vehicle for advancing the\nargument that defendant lacked the requisite intent to com-\nmit the charged crime.8 It follows that the trial court did not\nerr in declining to give the requested attempt instruction.\n                 III.  AS-APPLIED CHALLENGE\n                 TO DEFENDANT’S SENTENCES\n\t       We now turn to the state’s argument that the Court\nof Appeals erred in concluding that defendant’s sentences\nwere unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I,\nsection 16. As discussed, defendant had been convicted of\n\t8\n       As noted, defendant advanced the same theory of the case in his motion for\njudgment of acquittal. He did not, however, assign error on appeal to the denial of\nthat motion.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t381\n\nfelony sex crimes as defined in ORS 163A.005 twice before\nbeing sentenced for the present offenses, and, thus, he pre-\nsumptively was subject to the sentences of life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole that the trial court imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719. In its full text, that latter statute\nprovides:\n   \t “(1)  The presumptive sentence for a sex crime that\n   is a felony is life imprisonment without the possibility of\n   release or parole if the defendant has been sentenced for\n   sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the\n   current sentence.\n   \t “(2)  The court may impose a sentence other than the\n   presumptive sentence provided by subsection (1) of this sec-\n   tion if the court imposes a departure sentence authorized\n   by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission\n   based upon findings of substantial and compelling reasons.\n   \t   “(3)  For purposes of this section:\n   \t “(a)  Sentences for two or more convictions that are\n   imposed in the same sentencing proceeding are considered\n   to be one sentence; and\n   \t   “(b)  A prior sentence includes:\n   \t “(A)  Sentences imposed before, on or after July 31,\n   2001; and\n   \t “(B)  Sentences imposed by any other state or federal\n   court for comparable offenses.\n   \t “(4)  As used in this section, ‘sex crime’ has the mean-\n   ing given that term in ORS 163A.005.”\n\t        After the Court of Appeals issued its decision in\nthis case, we decided Althouse, 359 Or 668. In that case, we\nconsidered a challenge to the application of ORS 137.719 to\nconvictions for felony public indecency offenses under ORS\n163.465. The defendant in Althouse, like defendant here,\nhad been convicted of felony public indecency after already\nhaving been convicted of prior sexual offenses, thus trigger-\ning the application of ORS 137.719. We observed in that case\nthat the framework for the analysis of an as-applied dis-\nproportionality challenge to a true-life sentence under ORS\n137.719 requires consideration of the following factors:\n\f382\t                                           State v. Davidson\n\n   “ ‘(1) a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the\n   gravity of the crime; (2) a comparison of the penalties\n   imposed for other, related crimes; and (3) the criminal his-\n   tory of the defendant.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 684 (quoting Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or\nat 58). We further held in Althouse that, when a sentence\nis enhanced based on the defendant’s repeat-offender sta-\ntus, additional considerations come into play. For example, if\nthe defendant “ ‘is a menace to the community, his sentence\nshould be aimed at offering the most protection to the com-\nmunity, regardless of the relative innocuousness of the par-\nticular crime for which he is now convicted.’ ” Althouse, 359\nOr at 684 (quoting Tuel v. Gladden, 234 Or 1, 6, 379 P2d 553\n(1963)). We stated that the constitutionality of an enhanced\nsentence for repeated sexual offenses would “ ‘depend on the\nseriousness of repetitive sexual conduct of th[e] kind [pun-\nished by the statute] and the danger that it forecasts for\nothers unless the defendant is segregated from society.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 685 (quoting Jensen v. Gladden, 231\nOr 141, 144-45, 372 P2d 183 (1962) (brackets in Althouse)).\nWe concluded that, in the context of enhanced sentences for\nrepeat offenders, “the first and third of [the factors identi-\nfied in Rodriguez/Buck] overlap in comparing the severity\nof the penalty and the gravity of the crimes that gave rise to\nthe repeat offender sentence.” Althouse, 359 Or at 685.\n\t        In considering the first and third Rodriguez/Buck\nfactors in Althouse, we stated:\n   \t “We may agree with defendant that public indecency,\n   considered in isolation, is not as serious as some other sex\n   crimes. That much follows from the legislature’s classifi-\n   cation of that offense. The legislature has classified public\n   indecency as a misdemeanor unless the defendant previ-\n   ously has been convicted of public indecency or another\n   specified sex crime, in which case the offense is classified\n   as a Class C felony. ORS 163.465(2). This is not a case,\n   however, in which defendant’s criminal history consists of\n   a single conviction for public indecency, nor is it a case in\n   which the three convictions that resulted in a presumptive\n   life sentence under ORS 137.719(1) are three felony public\n   indecency convictions. Rather, this is a case in which defen-\n   dant, over a 30-year period, has been convicted of sexual\n   abuse and sodomy of his own and other people’s children,\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t383\n\n   as well as public indecency. And many of the charged and\n   uncharged instances in which defendant has engaged in\n   public indecency during that 30-year period have been\n   directed at or related to children.”\n359 Or at 687. We noted in Althouse that the defendant’s\ncriminal history “reflect[ed] a deeply ingrained pattern of\npredatory behavior” and concluded that, “[g]iven the seri-\nousness of [the] defendant’s repeated sexual misconduct and\nthe danger that it forecasts for others, we cannot say that\nimposing a presumptive life sentence in response to [the]\ndefendant’s pattern of criminal behavior violated Article I,\nsection 16.” Id. We further concluded that “an inability to\nreform one’s conduct despite repeated opportunities to do so\n* * * can justify the legislature’s decision to impose a life sen-\ntence without the possibility of parole.” Id. (citing Tuel, 234\nOr at 7).\n\t        We then examined the second Rodriguez/Buck fac-\ntor. With respect to that factor, the defendant in Althouse\nhad argued that ORS 137.719 covers numerous offenses,\nsome of which are much more serious than others, and thus\n“that three relatively low-level sex crimes can give rise to\nthe same presumptive life sentence under ORS 137.719(1)\nas three far more serious sex crimes.” In addressing that\nargument, we noted that the legislature, not the court, is\nprimarily responsible for ranking the severity of offenses,\nsubject to the caveat that, if the penalties for similar, yet\nmore “serious” crimes result in less severe sentences, the\nchallenged penalty may be unconstitutionally disproportion-\nate. Althouse, 359 Or at 689. We nevertheless rejected the\ndefendant’s comparative arguments that his sentence was\nmore severe than the sentence for other, related crimes. We\nobserved that (1) ORS 137.719 “does not require the same life\nsentence no matter how disparate the combination of convic-\ntions that give rise to a repeat-offender sentence under that\nstatute”; and (2) “[a] trial court may impose a downward\ndeparture sentence under ORS 137.719(2) for less egregious\ncombinations of offenses.” Id. at 690 (emphasis added). We\nultimately concluded in Althouse that, because the defen-\ndant’s “sentence appears proportionate to his particular\ncriminal history, the comparisons that he invites us to make\nprovide no reason to hold that a life sentence, as applied to\n\f384\t                                        State v. Davidson\n\nhim, is disproportionate in violation of Article I, section 16.”\nId. at 692.\n\t        We now turn to the application of the factors iden-\ntified in Rodriguez/Buck, as expanded on in Althouse, to\nthe present case. Under the first and third factors set out\nin Rodriguez/Buck, we examine the gravity of the current\noffenses and the severity of the penalty imposed for it, in\nlight of defendant’s criminal history. As noted, defendant\nfirst was convicted of misdemeanor public indecency in\n2006, based on an incident in which he masturbated on the\nporch of a woman in whom he had taken a sexual interest\nbut did not know. A neighbor observed his conduct, and the\nwoman on whose porch he committed the offense ultimately\nobtained a stalking protective order against him. Because\ndefendant did not have prior convictions for sexual offenses,\nthat public indecency crime was a Class A misdemeanor\nunder ORS 163.465(2).\n\t        Defendant’s other two public indecency convictions—\nthe ones that subjected him to enhanced sentences under\nORS 137.319(1) in this case—were not misdemeanors.\nRather, as noted, those convictions were classified as felo-\nnies under ORS 163.465(2)(b) because of his previous misde-\nmeanor conviction for public indecency. Defendant’s second\nconviction, as described above, involved indecent exposure in\nview of several adults on a school playground where children\nwere present. His third offense involved exposing himself in\na public parking lot in view of a number of people, and where\na child was present. All the prior offenses were observed\nby private citizens who were disturbed by defendant’s con-\nduct. Moreover, the first prior offense caused a significant\namount of fear to a person who did not directly witness\ndefendant exposing himself; as noted, the woman on whose\nporch defendant masturbated was concerned enough about\nhis behavior to obtain a stalking protective order. Thus, the\ncircumstances of defendant’s past public indecency offenses\ndemonstrated that they caused harm to others, and that\nthey often had at least the potential to cause even greater\nharm due to the presence of children nearby.\n\t       The two current public indecency convictions obvi-\nously are of greater concern in light of defendant’s significant\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t385\n\nhistory of committing similar offenses. The first of the two\ncurrent offenses involved conduct in a public park where—\ndespite defendant’s intimations to the contrary—numerous\npeople had the ability to see what he was doing. The second\nincident involved masturbation near the same public park,\nshortly after defendant had fled and presumably was aware\nthat he was being pursued. That he resumed his mastur-\nbation activities under those circumstances is consistent\nwith what his criminal history implies—that he has little\ncontrol over his behavior or understanding of the socially\nunacceptable nature of his conduct. In addition, defendant’s\nlengthy history of committing other minor crimes, his lack\nof success while under supervision, and his other nonsexual\nmisconduct all indicate that he is highly resistive to reform.\n\t          That said, the issue before us is the proportionality\nof a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a series\nof offenses that, if viewed in isolation and without consider-\nation of criminal history, would be misdemeanors that each\nwould merit, at most, incarceration for a period not to exceed\none year. As we stated in Althouse, the constitutionality of\nthe sentence will “ ‘depend on the seriousness of the repeti-\ntive sexual conduct’ ” as well as the “ ‘danger that it forecasts\nfor others[.]’ ” 359 Or at 685 (quoting Jensen, 231 Or at 144-\n45). The primary danger identified here is that defendant’s\nrepeated behavior will continue to cause upset and possi-\nble harm to people who observe him exposing himself and\nmasturbating.\n\t         The state asserts that that danger is very serious,\nciting a study that indicates that nearly 29 percent of the peo-\nple who witness acts of public exhibitionism have increased\nfear of sexual crime. See Sharon Riordan, Indecent Exposure:\nThe Impact Upon the Victim’s Fear of Sexual Crime, Journal\nof Forensic Psych, vol 10, No 2, 309, 313, 315 (1999). The state\nasserts that defendant’s history supports a conclusion that\nhe deliberately targets others, noting that, when he commit-\nted his first offense, he called out, “You want some of this?”\nto the neighbor who observed him; that one of the school\nemployees who observed his second offense thought that he\nwanted her to see him masturbate; and that when he was\napprehended after his third offense, he indicated that he\n\f386\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nthought that women who observed him masturbating might\nbecome sexually attracted to him. The state describes that\ncited conduct as “aggressive” behavior toward “vulnerable”\nmembers of the public.\n\t         Although we do not take such harm lightly, that\ntype of harm stands in contrast to the harms at issue in\nAlthouse. In that case, the defendant, who had a significant\nhistory of exposing himself in public, also had a lengthy his-\ntory of sexually abusing children, including attempting to\nestablish contact with children at or near the time he was\nexposing himself. 359 Or at 679-81. Unlike the defendant in\nAlthouse, nothing in defendant’s criminal history or history\nof other misconduct indicates that he specifically preys on\nchildren or that he has sexually abused a child. Cf. Jensen,\n231 Or at 144-45 (upholding life-with-possibility-of-parole\nsentence for public indecency, where defendant previously\nhad committed felony sex offense against a child). Although\nthe state is correct that defendant apparently has no inhi-\nbitions about committing the crime of public indecency in\nthe presence of children, and such behavior clearly puts chil-\ndren at risk of harm if they observe it, the record does not\nsuggest that he has specifically targeted children to observe\nhis acts, or that he has committed such acts in the course\nof or in furtherance of other crimes that target children, as\nwas the circumstance in Althouse.\n\t        More generally, unwillingly observing sexual behav-\nior by another person is not a harm of the same magnitude\nas being specifically and personally subjected to unwanted\nphysical sexual contact or sexual violence. Defendant’s\nbehavior, while not passive and certainly reprehensible to\nthose witnessing it, was not aggressive in the sense that he\nactively pursued victims or attempted to have physical con-\ntact with them; instead, he generally showed sexual interest\nin whomever happened to observe him.9\n\t9\n      Although there was evidence that defendant did, in fact, have a specific\nsexual interest in the woman on whose porch he masturbated when he committed\nhis first public indecency offense, that person did not witness the crime. Rather,\na neighbor of that woman witnessed the crime. There was no evidence that defen-\ndant either intended to expose himself to the woman on whose porch he stood or\nthat defendant’s exposure of himself to the neighbor was anything other than\nopportunistic.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t387\n\n\t         To recapitulate with respect to the first and third\nRodriguez/Buck factors (gravity of the offense compared to\nthe severity of the penalty, and defendant’s criminal history),\npublic indecency generally can be considered either a high-\nlevel misdemeanor or a low-level felony, depending on the\nperpetrator’s criminal history. ORS 163.465(2). It involves\nthe exposure of a defendant’s genitals in a public place or\nin view thereof, with the intent to arouse sexual desire, but\nit does not require that there be any physical contact with\nanother person. ORS 163.465(1)(c). In terms of gravity, it is\nnot as serious as a sexual offense that involves nonconsen-\nsual sexual contact or sexual behaviors targeting children,\nwhich, as discussed below in our evaluation of the second\nRodriguez/Buck factor, generally carry greater sentences.\nThe penalty involved—life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole—is the most severe penalty available under\nOregon law, other than the death penalty, which is available\nonly in certain cases of aggravated murder.10 Defendant’s\ncriminal history, although lengthy and varied, almost exclu-\nsively consisted of low-level offenses; it did not include sex-\nual offenses that entailed physical contact with victims or\nthat appeared to specifically target child victims. Those con-\nsiderations all tend to support defendant’s argument that\nhis sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole are disproportionate under Article I, section 16.\n\t        On the other side of the scale, the state accurately\nobserves that defendant’s criminal history demonstrates\nthat lesser criminal sanctions have not deterred him from\nre-offending. As this court stated in Tuel, one of the pur-\nposes of statutes that provide enhanced penalties for repeat\noffenders is to recognize that some offenders simply are not\ndeterred by criminal sanctions and such people likely will\ncontinue to re-offend if released from confinement. 234 Or\nat 6-7; see also Althouse, 359 Or at 685 (same). Nonetheless,\nthat consideration is only one among others, and, as indicated\n\t10\n        In Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 US 407, 128 S Ct 2641, 171 L Ed 2d 525, mod-\nified on denial of reh’g, 554 US 945, 129 S Ct 1, 171 L Ed 2d 932 (2008), the United\nStates Supreme Court held that imposition of the death penalty for the rape of\na child was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. The Court stated: “As it relates to crimes against individuals, * * *\nthe death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was\nnot taken.” Id. at 438.\n\f388\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nabove, the other considerations under the first and third\nRodriguez/Buck factors that are at issue here suggest that\nimposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole on a defendant who commits crimes such as\nthese, and whose criminal history does not reflect that he\nposes a significant physical danger to the public, does not\ncomport with Article I, section 16.\n\t        Our consideration of the second Rodriguez/Buck\nfactor reinforces that assessment. In applying that factor,\nwe consider the penalties imposed for other crimes that have\nsimilar characteristics to the crime at issue in this case. 347\nOr at 65. It is useful to compare the seriousness of similar\ncrimes that may result in the same penalty as defendant’s\nsentence, as well as to examine similar yet more serious\ncrimes that may result in a lesser sentence than the one\nimposed on defendant. Id. at 74-76. Looking at the serious-\nness of similar crimes that may result in the same penalty\nas defendant’s sentence, we note that, unlike felony public\nindecency, most of the other felony sex crimes that may result\nin the imposition of a true-life sentence under ORS 137.719\ninvolve nonconsensual sexual contact or sexual exploitation\nof child victims.11 A considerable number of those felonies\n(including first- and second-degree rape, first-degree sexual\nabuse, unlawful sexual penetration, sodomy, and kidnap-\nping) carry mandatory minimum sentences of at least 70\nmonths imprisonment. ORS 137.700(2). The remaining fel-\nonies are ranked under the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines\nbetween categories 5 and 10, with the majority being in\nthe higher ranges. Presumptive sentences in those ranges\ncan vary from between probation and 60 months’ imprison-\nment for offenders with no criminal history, to between 15\nand 130 months’ imprisonment for offenders with extensive\ncriminal histories. Most of the listed offenses are ranked\nhigher (more seriously) in the Sentencing Guidelines than is\nfelony public indecency. Felony public indecency also is one\nof the few crimes on the list that does not require—although\n\n\t11\n        ORS 163A.005(5), is partially incorporated by reference in ORS 137.719(1),\nlists both felony and non-felony sex crimes. ORS 137.719(1) applies only if the\nprior sex crimes were felonies, so the entire compendium of offenses contained in\nORS 163A.005(5) are not necessarily “related crimes” for purposes of our dispro-\nportionality analysis.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t389\n\nit certainly may have—an identifiable victim. In light of\nthose considerations, we conclude that the gravity of the\noffense of public indecency is relatively minor in comparison\nwith the majority of the other sex offenses identified in ORS\n163A.005(5) that may result in a true-life sentence under\nORS 137.719. Cf. Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or at 61 (where a\nstatute criminalizes “broad range of activity” and defen-\ndant “is convicted for engaging in only more minor conduct\nencompassed within the statute, the defendant may plau-\nsibly argue that the mandatory sentence, as applied to the\nparticular facts of his or her case, is unconstitutionally\ndisproportionate”).\n\t        Turning to similar yet more serious crimes that\nmay result in a lesser sentence than the one imposed on\ndefendant, we note that, in Rodriguez/Buck, this court\ndiscouraged “roam[ing] freely through the criminal code,\ndeciding which crimes are more or less serious than others.”\nId. at 64. In that case, which involved convictions for first-\ndegree sexual abuse, the court concluded that the pertinent\nrelated offenses were sexual offenses set out in ORS 163.305\nto 163.479. We reach the same conclusion here, given that\npublic indecency is one of the statutes in that range.\n\t        Most of the sexual offenses described in ORS\n163.305 to 163.479 are felonies that are “sex crimes”\nunder ORS 163A.005(5) and, thus, are subject—in some\ncircumstances—to the same type of sentence that defen-\ndant received here. Some, however, are not. For example,\npurchasing sex with a minor, a felony, is only considered a\n“sex crime” under some circumstances. ORS 163.413; ORS\n163A.005(5)(v). As another example, third-degree sexual\nabuse is a Class A misdemeanor and may involve (1) non-\nconsensual sexual contact; (2) sexual contact with a person\nunder the age of 18; or (3) propelling blood, urine, semen or\nfeces at a nonconsenting person with the intent of arous-\ning sexual desire. ORS 163.415. In addition, contributing\nto the sexual delinquency of a minor, which involves sex-\nual intercourse with a person under the age of 18, also is\na Class A misdemeanor. ORS 163.435. Sexual misconduct\nwith a person under the age of 18 is a Class C misdemeanor.\nORS 163.445. Second-degree custodial sexual misconduct,\nwhich involves sexual contact with a person in custody or\n\f390\t                                       State v. Davidson\n\non supervision by a supervisor, is a Class A misdemeanor.\nORS 163.454. Private indecency, which is similar to public\nindecency, except that it involves exposure of genitals at a\nlocation where the victim has a “reasonable expectation of\nprivacy,” similarly is a Class A misdemeanor. ORS 163.467.\nUnlawful dissemination of an intimate image, which can\nbe either a Class A misdemeanor or a felony, and involves\ndisclosure of intimate images on the internet for the pur-\npose of harassing, humiliating, or injuring another, is not\na “sex crime” for purposes of ORS 137.719(1). ORS 163.472.\nUnlawfully being in a location where children regularly\ncongregate, an offense that applies only to those previously\ndesignated as sexual offenders, is a Class A misdemeanor.\nORS 163.476. And finally, unlawful contact with a child,\nORS 163.479, another offense that applies only to offenders\nwho previously have committed sexual offenses, and which\ninvolves contact with a child “with the intent to commit a\ncrime or for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual\ndesires of the person or another person,” is a Class C felony\nthat is not listed under ORS 163A.005(5) and therefore not\nsubject to ORS 137.719(1).\n\t         We have no difficulty in concluding that most of,\nif not all, the sexual offenses described above that are not\nwithin the purview of ORS 137.719(1)—and, thus, not subject\nto a presumptive true-life sentence—can be viewed as being\nat least as serious as public indecency. Indeed, the two that\nare arguably the most similar (because they involve noncon-\nsensual conduct for the purpose of arousing sexual desire)\nare private indecency, which involves intrusion into a place\nwhere a victim has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and\nthe type of sexual abuse that involves flinging blood, urine,\nsemen or feces at another person. Both those offenses are\nclassified as misdemeanors. In sum, in light of the other sex-\nual offenses set out in ORS chapter 163 and their respective\npenalties, we conclude that a life sentence without the pos-\nsibility of parole for public indecency is among the harshest\nsentences available under Oregon law when the gravity of\nthe offense is compared to the severity of the penalty.\n\t        We do not mean to suggest that the inclusion of pub-\nlic indecency in ORS 137.719(1) is facially unconstitutional.\nIndeed, we upheld the facial constitutionality of that statute\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t391\n\nin State v. Wheeler, 343 Or 652, 175 P3d 438 (2007). And,\nas noted, we rejected an as-applied challenge to a life sen-\ntence under that statute for public indecency most recently\nin Althouse, 359 Or 668. But where, as here, a criminal\ndefendant—even an incorrigible one—has a criminal his-\ntory that includes no offenses more serious than public inde-\ncency (and no other misconduct that otherwise supports a\nconclusion that he poses a significant physical danger to\nsociety), a sentence of life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole for public indecency is unconstitutionally dis-\nproportionate under Article I, section 16.\n\t        The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nThe judgment of the circuit court is affirmed in part and\nreversed in part, and the case is remanded to the circuit\ncourt for resentencing.\n\f",

The\nstate also sought review, asserting, first, that defendant’s\nsentences are unreviewable because they are “presumptive”\nsentences and, second, that the sentences were not unconsti-\ntutionally disproportionate in light of the facts of this case\nand the circumstances of defendant’s previous crimes. We\nallowed both petitions. As explained below, we affirm defen-\ndant’s convictions, but we conclude that the sentences are\nunconstitutionally disproportionate as applied to defendant.\nAccordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals,\nand we reverse defendant’s sentences and remand to the cir-\ncuit court for resentencing.\n\t        This case presents some of the same issues that we\nrecently addressed in State v. Althouse, 359 Or 668, 375 P3d\n475 (2016). Althouse, in fact, forecloses the state’s review-\nability argument, and we therefore reject that argument\nwithout further discussion. See id. at 678 (holding that\nORS 138.222(2)(a) does not preclude review of sentence\nof life imprisonment without possibility of parole imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719). In addition to its reviewability\n\t1\n     ORS 137.719(1) provides:\n \t     “The presumptive sentence for a sex crime that is a felony is life impris-\n onment without the possibility of release or parole if the defendant has been\n sentenced for sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the cur-\n rent sentence.”\n\t2\n     Article I, section 16, provides, in part:\n “Cruel and unusual punishments shall not be inflicted, but all penalties shall\n be proportioned to the offense.”\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t373\n\nholding, Althouse set out a framework for the consideration of\nas-applied constitutional challenges to sentences imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719. Accordingly, we first address\ndefendant’s challenge to his underlying convictions under\nORS 163.465 and then evaluate the constitutionality of\nthe life sentences imposed for those convictions under the\nframework set out in Althouse.\n       I.  FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA.  Current Convictions\n\t        Because the jury found defendant guilty of the cur-\nrent charges, we view the evidence presented at trial in\nthe light most favorable to the state. State v. Agee, 358 Or\n325, 327, 364 P3d 971 (2015). A group of women and chil-\ndren were having lunch in a park in Salem when defendant\nwalked by and waved at them. After the older children left\nthe group to play on a nearby play structure, a man came by\nand told the group that defendant was behind a nearby tree.\nOne of the women, Davis, looked over her shoulder and could\nsee defendant peeking out at her from behind the tree.\n\t        When Davis stood up and turned, she was able to\nsee that defendant was exposing his genitals and mastur-\nbating. Davis called 9-1-1 and gathered her group together\nto return to their car. As they left, defendant approached\nand told Davis several times that he was leaving; he then\nleft through the south end of the park. Responding offi-\ncers searched the area to the south of the park and found\ndefendant standing at a fence bordering the park, looking\ninto the park. As the officers approached defendant, they\ncould see that he had his pants open and was masturbat-\ning. Defendant was then arrested and subsequently charged\nwith and convicted by a jury of two counts of public inde-\ncency, one count for the incident near Davis’s group and the\nother count for the incident at the border of the park shortly\nbefore he was apprehended.\nB.  Prior Public Indecency Convictions\n\t        Defendant’s prior convictions for public indecency\nwere relevant to his sentencing on his current convic-\ntions, because the prior convictions elevated those offenses\n\f374\t                                                      State v. Davidson\n\nfrom misdemeanors to felony public indecency. See ORS\n163.465(2).3 In the guilt phase of the trial in this case, for\nthe purpose of establishing that the current offenses were\nproperly charged as Class C felony offenses, defendant\nstipulated to the existence of three prior public indecency\nconvictions. The details of defendant’s prior convictions, as\ndescribed below, were presented in a presentence investiga-\ntion report in the course of the sentencing proceeding.4\n\t        In 2006, defendant was convicted of the crime of\nmisdemeanor public indecency and placed on probation.\nThat offense occurred when defendant was observed by a\nneighbor while defendant was standing on the porch of a\nhouse and masturbating. When defendant saw the neighbor,\nhe called out to her, “you want some of this?” as he continued\nto masturbate. The neighbor called the police. Nobody was\nhome at the house when the incident occurred, but, when\nquestioned by the police, defendant claimed to have been\nvisiting “Amy” at the house and suggested that he had some\nsort of intimate relationship with “Amy.” Defendant even\ndescribed some items inside the house. The police later con-\ntacted the homeowner, who was not named “Amy,” and she\ndenied knowing defendant. The police also discovered that\ndefendant’s grandmother lived near the house where the\noffense occurred, that defendant had stayed with his grand-\nmother at some point in time, and that his grandmother\nhad entered his bedroom and discovered him masturbating\nwhile looking out the window toward the house where the\noffense later occurred. Finally, the police located a letter in\ndefendant’s backpack written by defendant to another per-\nson, stating that he had a crush on her and had watched her\nmow her lawn. The woman who owned the house where the\noffense occurred acknowledged that she regularly mowed the\n\t3\n        ORS 163.465(2) provides:\n    \t     “(a)  Public indecency is a Class A misdemeanor.\n    \t     “(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this subsection, public indecency\n    is a Class C felony if the person has a prior conviction for public indecency or\n    a crime described in ORS 163.355 to 163.445 or for a crime in another juris-\n    diction that, if committed in this state, would constitute public indecency or\n    a crime described in ORS 163.355 to 163.445.”\n\t4\n        At sentencing, defendant also made a personal statement to the court, but\nneither party presented additional evidence beyond what was contained in the\npresentence investigation report.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t375\n\nlawn around her house. The woman subsequently obtained\na stalking protective order against defendant.\n\t        Defendant was convicted of misdemeanor public\nindecency arising out of the incident on the porch, and he\nwas sentenced to probation for that offense. Several months\nlater, while defendant was on probation for that offense,\na number of school staff members reported that they had\nobserved defendant expose his genitals while masturbating\nnear an elementary school playground. One of those staff\nmembers indicated that, when defendant saw her looking at\nhim through a window, he turned to face her as if he wanted\nher to observe him. Three children also saw defendant near\nthe school, although the record did not indicate whether\nthey saw him expose his genitals. Defendant was convicted\nof public indecency for that conduct, and, because he had a\nprior misdemeanor public indecency conviction, his convic-\ntion for the school incident was elevated to a felony under\nORS 163.465(2). Defendant served a 28-month prison sen-\ntence for that conviction.\n\t        Shortly after defendant was released from prison on\nhis sentence for the school incident, defendant again was\narrested for and convicted of felony public indecency. In that\nincident, a group of women (who had a child with them) were\nnear their car in a store parking lot when they observed\ndefendant looking at them while he exposed his genitals\nand masturbated. When the police arrived, an officer also\nobserved defendant masturbating in the parking lot. After\ndefendant was apprehended, he told the police that he had\nbeen masturbating inside a nearby pornography shop and\nthat he had masturbated in front of the women after he left\nthe store because he thought that it would make the women\n“hot” and that he would be able to get a “date.”\nC.  Other Prior Convictions and Misconduct\n\t        In evaluating disproportionality challenges to crim-\ninal sentences, it is appropriate for a court to consider any\nprior conviction, as well as misconduct that did not result\nin convictions. Althouse, 359 Or at 679; State v. Rodriguez/\nBuck, 347 Or 46, 78, 217 P3d 659 (2009). In the present case,\nthe presentence investigation report indicated that defen-\ndant first came into contact with police at age 10, when he\n\f376\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nwas accused of shoplifting a toy.5 He was first referred to\nthe juvenile court at age 14 based on a fighting incident at\nhis junior high school; that referral was disposed of infor-\nmally. When he was in his late teens and early twenties,\ndefendant had numerous contacts with law enforcement,\nprimarily involving possession of controlled substances. He\nalso was arrested twice for battery based on fights with his\ngirlfriend, but those charges were dismissed. He was con-\nvicted on one occasion of trespass and investigated for tres-\npass based on several other incidents, some of which arose\nin conjunction with the public indecency incidents described\nabove. Defendant also had a single prior conviction for driv-\ning while suspended.\n\t        Most of defendant’s convictions for offenses other\nthan public indecency resulted in probationary sentences.\nThe record shows that defendant consistently performed\npoorly on probation and post-prison supervision, regularly\ncommitting new offenses while under supervision, as well\nas failing to appear at various hearings concerning proba-\ntion violations. While incarcerated, defendant received sanc-\ntions for misconduct (generally for disobedience) on numer-\nous occasions. Defendant has been diagnosed with various\nsubstance dependence disorders, as well as with a cognitive\ndisorder due to a traumatic brain injury that occurred when\nhe was a teenager.\nD.  Sentencing\n\t         At defendant’s sentencing, the state argued that\na sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole was appropriate, noting in particular that defen-\ndant’s first two public indecency offenses were committed in\na brief time interval, that the third offense occurred within\ndays after he was released from prison on the prior offenses,\nand that the current crimes also occurred within days of his\nrelease from prison for the third offense. For the most part,\nthe state’s focus at sentencing was not on the specifics of\nany of the public indecency offenses themselves (other than\n\n\t5\n       Defendant does not challenge the trial court’s consideration of evidence of\nhis prior misconduct and other criminal offenses contained in the presentence\ninvestigation report.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t377\n\nnoting that they caused harm to the victims), but rather on\ndefendant’s recidivism.\n\t        In response, defense counsel emphasized the fact\nthat none of defendant’s offenses involved violence or physi-\ncal contact with anyone; he argued that a life sentence with-\nout the possibility of parole is simply too harsh a punishment\nfor masturbating in public, even for a repeat offender. In his\nown statement at sentencing, defendant showed little or no\nunderstanding that society views his public sexual behavior\nas unacceptable.6\n\t        The circuit court noted that, under ORS 137.719, the\npresumptive sentences for defendant’s current convictions\nwere life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and\nconcluded that it could not identify any mitigating factor that\nwould justify downward departures from those presumptive\nsentences.7 Accordingly, the court sentenced defendant to\nconsecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole\non the current convictions.\nE.  Appeal\n\t        Defendant appealed, arguing that (1) his convic-\ntions should be reversed because the trial court had erred\nin failing to give a requested jury instruction on attempted\npublic indecency; and (2) his sentences should be reversed\nbecause the life sentences without the possibility of parole\nthat the court imposed were unconstitutionally dispropor-\ntionate under Article I, section 16. Defendant did not argue\nthat ORS 137.719 is facially unconstitutional. Rather, he\nasserted that the application of that statute in the present\ncircumstances was unconstitutional under Article I, sec-\ntion 16, because the penalty was disproportionate to the\n\t6\n        Defendant’s statements were consistent with the opinions of several mental\nhealth professionals who had evaluated him over the years. For example, the\nreport of defendant’s 2009 mental health evaluation states:\n     “He has obviously distorted sexual attitudes and opinions, believing that\n     women might be attracted to him by masturbating in public in their presence.”\n\t7\n        Defendant did not assert before the circuit court, nor has he asserted on\nappeal or review, that his mental health circumstances, including his apparent\nlack of appreciation for the criminality of his conduct, amount to a mitigating fac-\ntor in assessing the proportionality of his sentences. We therefore do not consider\nthat issue here.\n\f378\t                                           State v. Davidson\n\noffense. Defendant emphasized that public indecency his-\ntorically has been a misdemeanor offense under Oregon law,\nsee ORS 161.615(1) (maximum term of imprisonment for\nhighest-level misdemeanor offense is one year), and he urged\nthat the penalties imposed in this case were disproportion-\nate in comparison to sentences for other offenses of similar\nor greater gravity.\n\t        The Court of Appeals rejected defendant’s jury\ninstruction argument without discussion, but it agreed with\ndefendant that, as applied to his circumstances, the life sen-\ntences imposed on the two convictions for public indecency\nwere unconstitutionally disproportionate and, therefore,\nreversed those sentences and remanded to the circuit court\nfor resentencing. Davidson, 271 Or App at 721 n 4, 745.\n\t       The state sought review of the Court of Appeals’\ndecision with respect to defendant’s sentences, and defen-\ndant sought review of the Court of Appeals’ disposition of\nhis assignment of error relating to the jury instruction.\nWe granted both petitions for review, and, for the reasons\nexplained below, we affirm the decision of the Court of\nAppeals with respect to both issues.\n             II.  CHALLENGE TO DEFENDANT’S\n                       CONVICTIONS\n\t        We first consider defendant’s challenge to his con-\nvictions. ORS 163.465(1) provides:\n   \t “A person commits the crime of public indecency if while\n   in, or in view of, a public place the person performs:\n   \t   “(a)  An act of sexual intercourse;\n   \t   “(b)  An act of deviate sexual intercourse; or\n   \t “(c)  An act of exposing the genitals of the person with\n   the intent of arousing the sexual desire of the person or\n   another person.”\nDefendant was charged under paragraph (c) of that statute.\n\t        At trial, defendant moved for a judgment of acquit-\ntal, arguing that the state was required to prove that, when\nhe exposed himself, he intended other people to see what he\nwas doing, and asserting that a person who surreptitiously\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t379\n\nmasturbates in a public place but does not intend to be\nviewed by others does not violate that statute. That is, defen-\ndant argued, the state was required to prove that defendant\nexposed his genitals with the intent to arouse sexual desire\nby being seen exposing himself in public, not simply that he\nexposed his genitals intending to arouse sexual desire and\nthat that act occurred in, or view of, a public place. The trial\ncourt denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\t        Subsequently, in a colloquy regarding jury instruc-\ntions, defense counsel requested an instruction on attempted\npublic indecency, arguing: “[I]n this case, because especially\nin count two, or the second time [defendant] encountered\nsomeone else, no one else was around to see him and when\nhe was seen, he fled. It could be seen as an attempt[.]” When\nthe trial court asked for further clarification about how the\nevidence could support an attempt conviction, counsel indi-\ncated that the instruction could potentially apply to both\ncounts, adding: “Well, because ‘exposed,’ your Honor, can be\na couple of things. The fact that [Davis] had to get up and\nadjust her viewpoint to see what was going on, [defendant]\nwas not putting himself on display.” Defense counsel did not\nspecify precisely how he wanted the jury to be instructed\non attempted public indecency, but it is apparent from the\nquoted colloquy that he sought the “attempt” instruction\nas a basis for arguing to the jury that the state’s evidence\nwas insufficient to prove that defendant was trying to be\nobserved when he committed the “act of exposing the gen-\nitals” described in ORS 163.465(1)(c), an argument similar\nto the one that he had made in support of the motion for\njudgment of acquittal.\n\t        “A party is generally entitled to a jury instruction\nbased on its theory of the case if the instruction is war-\nranted by the particular facts and correctly states the law.”\nState v. Washington, 355 Or 612, 653, 330 P3d 596 (2014).\nWe presume that defendant wanted a standard instruction\non “attempt” that followed the text of the attempt statute\nand thus would have been a correct statement of the law.\nUnder ORS 161.405(1), an attempt crime occurs when a per-\nson “intentionally engages in conduct that constitutes a sub-\nstantial step toward commission of the crime.” The conduct\n\f380\t                                                      State v. Davidson\n\nthat constitutes the substantial step must “(1) advance the\ncriminal purpose charged and (2) provide some verification\nof the existence of that purpose.” State v. Walters, 311 Or 80,\n85, 804 P2d 1164 (1991). In sum, an attempt instruction is\nappropriate when the evidence could support a finding that\nthe defendant specifically intended to commit a crime and\ntook a substantial step toward doing so, but did not complete\nthe crime.\n\t        Defendant’s argument in this case, by contrast, was\nnot that the evidence permitted an inference that he intended\nto carry out the charged offenses of public indecency but did\nnot complete them. Rather, his argument was that the state\nwas required to prove that he intended to arouse himself\nby being observed exposing himself in public, and the state\nfailed to prove that he had the requisite intent to commit the\ncrimes at all. Stated differently, defendant’s theory was that\nno public indecency crime was committed because he lacked\nthe requisite intent to commit that offense.\n\t        So understood, an attempt instruction based on\nORS 161.405 would not have advanced defendant’s theory\nof the case. If defendant’s theory were correct, he would not\nhave been guilty of either an attempt—in that he would\nhave lacked the requisite specific intent to carry out that\noffense—or the completed offense. Accordingly, even assum-\ning that defendant’s theory of the case was sound—an issue\nthat we do not reach in this case—an attempt instruction\nwould not have been an appropriate vehicle for advancing the\nargument that defendant lacked the requisite intent to com-\nmit the charged crime.8 It follows that the trial court did not\nerr in declining to give the requested attempt instruction.\n                 III.  AS-APPLIED CHALLENGE\n                 TO DEFENDANT’S SENTENCES\n\t       We now turn to the state’s argument that the Court\nof Appeals erred in concluding that defendant’s sentences\nwere unconstitutionally disproportionate under Article I,\nsection 16. As discussed, defendant had been convicted of\n\t8\n       As noted, defendant advanced the same theory of the case in his motion for\njudgment of acquittal. He did not, however, assign error on appeal to the denial of\nthat motion.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t381\n\nfelony sex crimes as defined in ORS 163A.005 twice before\nbeing sentenced for the present offenses, and, thus, he pre-\nsumptively was subject to the sentences of life imprisonment\nwithout the possibility of parole that the trial court imposed\npursuant to ORS 137.719. In its full text, that latter statute\nprovides:\n   \t “(1)  The presumptive sentence for a sex crime that\n   is a felony is life imprisonment without the possibility of\n   release or parole if the defendant has been sentenced for\n   sex crimes that are felonies at least two times prior to the\n   current sentence.\n   \t “(2)  The court may impose a sentence other than the\n   presumptive sentence provided by subsection (1) of this sec-\n   tion if the court imposes a departure sentence authorized\n   by the rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission\n   based upon findings of substantial and compelling reasons.\n   \t   “(3)  For purposes of this section:\n   \t “(a)  Sentences for two or more convictions that are\n   imposed in the same sentencing proceeding are considered\n   to be one sentence; and\n   \t   “(b)  A prior sentence includes:\n   \t “(A)  Sentences imposed before, on or after July 31,\n   2001; and\n   \t “(B)  Sentences imposed by any other state or federal\n   court for comparable offenses.\n   \t “(4)  As used in this section, ‘sex crime’ has the mean-\n   ing given that term in ORS 163A.005.”\n\t        After the Court of Appeals issued its decision in\nthis case, we decided Althouse, 359 Or 668. In that case, we\nconsidered a challenge to the application of ORS 137.719 to\nconvictions for felony public indecency offenses under ORS\n163.465. The defendant in Althouse, like defendant here,\nhad been convicted of felony public indecency after already\nhaving been convicted of prior sexual offenses, thus trigger-\ning the application of ORS 137.719. We observed in that case\nthat the framework for the analysis of an as-applied dis-\nproportionality challenge to a true-life sentence under ORS\n137.719 requires consideration of the following factors:\n\f382\t                                           State v. Davidson\n\n   “ ‘(1) a comparison of the severity of the penalty and the\n   gravity of the crime; (2) a comparison of the penalties\n   imposed for other, related crimes; and (3) the criminal his-\n   tory of the defendant.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 684 (quoting Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or\nat 58). We further held in Althouse that, when a sentence\nis enhanced based on the defendant’s repeat-offender sta-\ntus, additional considerations come into play. For example, if\nthe defendant “ ‘is a menace to the community, his sentence\nshould be aimed at offering the most protection to the com-\nmunity, regardless of the relative innocuousness of the par-\nticular crime for which he is now convicted.’ ” Althouse, 359\nOr at 684 (quoting Tuel v. Gladden, 234 Or 1, 6, 379 P2d 553\n(1963)). We stated that the constitutionality of an enhanced\nsentence for repeated sexual offenses would “ ‘depend on the\nseriousness of repetitive sexual conduct of th[e] kind [pun-\nished by the statute] and the danger that it forecasts for\nothers unless the defendant is segregated from society.’ ”\nAlthouse, 359 Or at 685 (quoting Jensen v. Gladden, 231\nOr 141, 144-45, 372 P2d 183 (1962) (brackets in Althouse)).\nWe concluded that, in the context of enhanced sentences for\nrepeat offenders, “the first and third of [the factors identi-\nfied in Rodriguez/Buck] overlap in comparing the severity\nof the penalty and the gravity of the crimes that gave rise to\nthe repeat offender sentence.” Althouse, 359 Or at 685.\n\t        In considering the first and third Rodriguez/Buck\nfactors in Althouse, we stated:\n   \t “We may agree with defendant that public indecency,\n   considered in isolation, is not as serious as some other sex\n   crimes. That much follows from the legislature’s classifi-\n   cation of that offense. The legislature has classified public\n   indecency as a misdemeanor unless the defendant previ-\n   ously has been convicted of public indecency or another\n   specified sex crime, in which case the offense is classified\n   as a Class C felony. ORS 163.465(2). This is not a case,\n   however, in which defendant’s criminal history consists of\n   a single conviction for public indecency, nor is it a case in\n   which the three convictions that resulted in a presumptive\n   life sentence under ORS 137.719(1) are three felony public\n   indecency convictions. Rather, this is a case in which defen-\n   dant, over a 30-year period, has been convicted of sexual\n   abuse and sodomy of his own and other people’s children,\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t383\n\n   as well as public indecency. And many of the charged and\n   uncharged instances in which defendant has engaged in\n   public indecency during that 30-year period have been\n   directed at or related to children.”\n359 Or at 687. We noted in Althouse that the defendant’s\ncriminal history “reflect[ed] a deeply ingrained pattern of\npredatory behavior” and concluded that, “[g]iven the seri-\nousness of [the] defendant’s repeated sexual misconduct and\nthe danger that it forecasts for others, we cannot say that\nimposing a presumptive life sentence in response to [the]\ndefendant’s pattern of criminal behavior violated Article I,\nsection 16.” Id. We further concluded that “an inability to\nreform one’s conduct despite repeated opportunities to do so\n* * * can justify the legislature’s decision to impose a life sen-\ntence without the possibility of parole.” Id. (citing Tuel, 234\nOr at 7).\n\t        We then examined the second Rodriguez/Buck fac-\ntor. With respect to that factor, the defendant in Althouse\nhad argued that ORS 137.719 covers numerous offenses,\nsome of which are much more serious than others, and thus\n“that three relatively low-level sex crimes can give rise to\nthe same presumptive life sentence under ORS 137.719(1)\nas three far more serious sex crimes.” In addressing that\nargument, we noted that the legislature, not the court, is\nprimarily responsible for ranking the severity of offenses,\nsubject to the caveat that, if the penalties for similar, yet\nmore “serious” crimes result in less severe sentences, the\nchallenged penalty may be unconstitutionally disproportion-\nate. Althouse, 359 Or at 689. We nevertheless rejected the\ndefendant’s comparative arguments that his sentence was\nmore severe than the sentence for other, related crimes. We\nobserved that (1) ORS 137.719 “does not require the same life\nsentence no matter how disparate the combination of convic-\ntions that give rise to a repeat-offender sentence under that\nstatute”; and (2) “[a] trial court may impose a downward\ndeparture sentence under ORS 137.719(2) for less egregious\ncombinations of offenses.” Id. at 690 (emphasis added). We\nultimately concluded in Althouse that, because the defen-\ndant’s “sentence appears proportionate to his particular\ncriminal history, the comparisons that he invites us to make\nprovide no reason to hold that a life sentence, as applied to\n\f384\t                                        State v. Davidson\n\nhim, is disproportionate in violation of Article I, section 16.”\nId. at 692.\n\t        We now turn to the application of the factors iden-\ntified in Rodriguez/Buck, as expanded on in Althouse, to\nthe present case. Under the first and third factors set out\nin Rodriguez/Buck, we examine the gravity of the current\noffenses and the severity of the penalty imposed for it, in\nlight of defendant’s criminal history. As noted, defendant\nfirst was convicted of misdemeanor public indecency in\n2006, based on an incident in which he masturbated on the\nporch of a woman in whom he had taken a sexual interest\nbut did not know. A neighbor observed his conduct, and the\nwoman on whose porch he committed the offense ultimately\nobtained a stalking protective order against him. Because\ndefendant did not have prior convictions for sexual offenses,\nthat public indecency crime was a Class A misdemeanor\nunder ORS 163.465(2).\n\t        Defendant’s other two public indecency convictions—\nthe ones that subjected him to enhanced sentences under\nORS 137.319(1) in this case—were not misdemeanors.\nRather, as noted, those convictions were classified as felo-\nnies under ORS 163.465(2)(b) because of his previous misde-\nmeanor conviction for public indecency. Defendant’s second\nconviction, as described above, involved indecent exposure in\nview of several adults on a school playground where children\nwere present. His third offense involved exposing himself in\na public parking lot in view of a number of people, and where\na child was present. All the prior offenses were observed\nby private citizens who were disturbed by defendant’s con-\nduct. Moreover, the first prior offense caused a significant\namount of fear to a person who did not directly witness\ndefendant exposing himself; as noted, the woman on whose\nporch defendant masturbated was concerned enough about\nhis behavior to obtain a stalking protective order. Thus, the\ncircumstances of defendant’s past public indecency offenses\ndemonstrated that they caused harm to others, and that\nthey often had at least the potential to cause even greater\nharm due to the presence of children nearby.\n\t       The two current public indecency convictions obvi-\nously are of greater concern in light of defendant’s significant\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t385\n\nhistory of committing similar offenses. The first of the two\ncurrent offenses involved conduct in a public park where—\ndespite defendant’s intimations to the contrary—numerous\npeople had the ability to see what he was doing. The second\nincident involved masturbation near the same public park,\nshortly after defendant had fled and presumably was aware\nthat he was being pursued. That he resumed his mastur-\nbation activities under those circumstances is consistent\nwith what his criminal history implies—that he has little\ncontrol over his behavior or understanding of the socially\nunacceptable nature of his conduct. In addition, defendant’s\nlengthy history of committing other minor crimes, his lack\nof success while under supervision, and his other nonsexual\nmisconduct all indicate that he is highly resistive to reform.\n\t          That said, the issue before us is the proportionality\nof a life sentence without the possibility of parole for a series\nof offenses that, if viewed in isolation and without consider-\nation of criminal history, would be misdemeanors that each\nwould merit, at most, incarceration for a period not to exceed\none year. As we stated in Althouse, the constitutionality of\nthe sentence will “ ‘depend on the seriousness of the repeti-\ntive sexual conduct’ ” as well as the “ ‘danger that it forecasts\nfor others[.]’ ” 359 Or at 685 (quoting Jensen, 231 Or at 144-\n45). The primary danger identified here is that defendant’s\nrepeated behavior will continue to cause upset and possi-\nble harm to people who observe him exposing himself and\nmasturbating.\n\t         The state asserts that that danger is very serious,\nciting a study that indicates that nearly 29 percent of the peo-\nple who witness acts of public exhibitionism have increased\nfear of sexual crime. See Sharon Riordan, Indecent Exposure:\nThe Impact Upon the Victim’s Fear of Sexual Crime, Journal\nof Forensic Psych, vol 10, No 2, 309, 313, 315 (1999). The state\nasserts that defendant’s history supports a conclusion that\nhe deliberately targets others, noting that, when he commit-\nted his first offense, he called out, “You want some of this?”\nto the neighbor who observed him; that one of the school\nemployees who observed his second offense thought that he\nwanted her to see him masturbate; and that when he was\napprehended after his third offense, he indicated that he\n\f386\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nthought that women who observed him masturbating might\nbecome sexually attracted to him. The state describes that\ncited conduct as “aggressive” behavior toward “vulnerable”\nmembers of the public.\n\t         Although we do not take such harm lightly, that\ntype of harm stands in contrast to the harms at issue in\nAlthouse. In that case, the defendant, who had a significant\nhistory of exposing himself in public, also had a lengthy his-\ntory of sexually abusing children, including attempting to\nestablish contact with children at or near the time he was\nexposing himself. 359 Or at 679-81. Unlike the defendant in\nAlthouse, nothing in defendant’s criminal history or history\nof other misconduct indicates that he specifically preys on\nchildren or that he has sexually abused a child. Cf. Jensen,\n231 Or at 144-45 (upholding life-with-possibility-of-parole\nsentence for public indecency, where defendant previously\nhad committed felony sex offense against a child). Although\nthe state is correct that defendant apparently has no inhi-\nbitions about committing the crime of public indecency in\nthe presence of children, and such behavior clearly puts chil-\ndren at risk of harm if they observe it, the record does not\nsuggest that he has specifically targeted children to observe\nhis acts, or that he has committed such acts in the course\nof or in furtherance of other crimes that target children, as\nwas the circumstance in Althouse.\n\t        More generally, unwillingly observing sexual behav-\nior by another person is not a harm of the same magnitude\nas being specifically and personally subjected to unwanted\nphysical sexual contact or sexual violence. Defendant’s\nbehavior, while not passive and certainly reprehensible to\nthose witnessing it, was not aggressive in the sense that he\nactively pursued victims or attempted to have physical con-\ntact with them; instead, he generally showed sexual interest\nin whomever happened to observe him.9\n\t9\n      Although there was evidence that defendant did, in fact, have a specific\nsexual interest in the woman on whose porch he masturbated when he committed\nhis first public indecency offense, that person did not witness the crime. Rather,\na neighbor of that woman witnessed the crime. There was no evidence that defen-\ndant either intended to expose himself to the woman on whose porch he stood or\nthat defendant’s exposure of himself to the neighbor was anything other than\nopportunistic.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t387\n\n\t         To recapitulate with respect to the first and third\nRodriguez/Buck factors (gravity of the offense compared to\nthe severity of the penalty, and defendant’s criminal history),\npublic indecency generally can be considered either a high-\nlevel misdemeanor or a low-level felony, depending on the\nperpetrator’s criminal history. ORS 163.465(2). It involves\nthe exposure of a defendant’s genitals in a public place or\nin view thereof, with the intent to arouse sexual desire, but\nit does not require that there be any physical contact with\nanother person. ORS 163.465(1)(c). In terms of gravity, it is\nnot as serious as a sexual offense that involves nonconsen-\nsual sexual contact or sexual behaviors targeting children,\nwhich, as discussed below in our evaluation of the second\nRodriguez/Buck factor, generally carry greater sentences.\nThe penalty involved—life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole—is the most severe penalty available under\nOregon law, other than the death penalty, which is available\nonly in certain cases of aggravated murder.10 Defendant’s\ncriminal history, although lengthy and varied, almost exclu-\nsively consisted of low-level offenses; it did not include sex-\nual offenses that entailed physical contact with victims or\nthat appeared to specifically target child victims. Those con-\nsiderations all tend to support defendant’s argument that\nhis sentences of life imprisonment without the possibility of\nparole are disproportionate under Article I, section 16.\n\t        On the other side of the scale, the state accurately\nobserves that defendant’s criminal history demonstrates\nthat lesser criminal sanctions have not deterred him from\nre-offending. As this court stated in Tuel, one of the pur-\nposes of statutes that provide enhanced penalties for repeat\noffenders is to recognize that some offenders simply are not\ndeterred by criminal sanctions and such people likely will\ncontinue to re-offend if released from confinement. 234 Or\nat 6-7; see also Althouse, 359 Or at 685 (same). Nonetheless,\nthat consideration is only one among others, and, as indicated\n\t10\n        In Kennedy v.

The Court stated: “As it relates to crimes against individuals, * * *\nthe death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim’s life was\nnot taken.” Id. at 438.\n\f388\t                                                     State v. Davidson\n\nabove, the other considerations under the first and third\nRodriguez/Buck factors that are at issue here suggest that\nimposing a sentence of life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole on a defendant who commits crimes such as\nthese, and whose criminal history does not reflect that he\nposes a significant physical danger to the public, does not\ncomport with Article I, section 16.\n\t        Our consideration of the second Rodriguez/Buck\nfactor reinforces that assessment. In applying that factor,\nwe consider the penalties imposed for other crimes that have\nsimilar characteristics to the crime at issue in this case. 347\nOr at 65. It is useful to compare the seriousness of similar\ncrimes that may result in the same penalty as defendant’s\nsentence, as well as to examine similar yet more serious\ncrimes that may result in a lesser sentence than the one\nimposed on defendant. Id. at 74-76. Looking at the serious-\nness of similar crimes that may result in the same penalty\nas defendant’s sentence, we note that, unlike felony public\nindecency, most of the other felony sex crimes that may result\nin the imposition of a true-life sentence under ORS 137.719\ninvolve nonconsensual sexual contact or sexual exploitation\nof child victims.11 A considerable number of those felonies\n(including first- and second-degree rape, first-degree sexual\nabuse, unlawful sexual penetration, sodomy, and kidnap-\nping) carry mandatory minimum sentences of at least 70\nmonths imprisonment. ORS 137.700(2). The remaining fel-\nonies are ranked under the Oregon Sentencing Guidelines\nbetween categories 5 and 10, with the majority being in\nthe higher ranges. Presumptive sentences in those ranges\ncan vary from between probation and 60 months’ imprison-\nment for offenders with no criminal history, to between 15\nand 130 months’ imprisonment for offenders with extensive\ncriminal histories. Most of the listed offenses are ranked\nhigher (more seriously) in the Sentencing Guidelines than is\nfelony public indecency. Felony public indecency also is one\nof the few crimes on the list that does not require—although\n\n\t11\n        ORS 163A.005(5), is partially incorporated by reference in ORS 137.719(1),\nlists both felony and non-felony sex crimes. ORS 137.719(1) applies only if the\nprior sex crimes were felonies, so the entire compendium of offenses contained in\nORS 163A.005(5) are not necessarily “related crimes” for purposes of our dispro-\nportionality analysis.\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t389\n\nit certainly may have—an identifiable victim. In light of\nthose considerations, we conclude that the gravity of the\noffense of public indecency is relatively minor in comparison\nwith the majority of the other sex offenses identified in ORS\n163A.005(5) that may result in a true-life sentence under\nORS 137.719. Cf. Rodriguez/Buck, 347 Or at 61 (where a\nstatute criminalizes “broad range of activity” and defen-\ndant “is convicted for engaging in only more minor conduct\nencompassed within the statute, the defendant may plau-\nsibly argue that the mandatory sentence, as applied to the\nparticular facts of his or her case, is unconstitutionally\ndisproportionate”).\n\t        Turning to similar yet more serious crimes that\nmay result in a lesser sentence than the one imposed on\ndefendant, we note that, in Rodriguez/Buck, this court\ndiscouraged “roam[ing] freely through the criminal code,\ndeciding which crimes are more or less serious than others.”\nId. at 64. In that case, which involved convictions for first-\ndegree sexual abuse, the court concluded that the pertinent\nrelated offenses were sexual offenses set out in ORS 163.305\nto 163.479. We reach the same conclusion here, given that\npublic indecency is one of the statutes in that range.\n\t        Most of the sexual offenses described in ORS\n163.305 to 163.479 are felonies that are “sex crimes”\nunder ORS 163A.005(5) and, thus, are subject—in some\ncircumstances—to the same type of sentence that defen-\ndant received here. Some, however, are not. For example,\npurchasing sex with a minor, a felony, is only considered a\n“sex crime” under some circumstances. ORS 163.413; ORS\n163A.005(5)(v). As another example, third-degree sexual\nabuse is a Class A misdemeanor and may involve (1) non-\nconsensual sexual contact; (2) sexual contact with a person\nunder the age of 18; or (3) propelling blood, urine, semen or\nfeces at a nonconsenting person with the intent of arous-\ning sexual desire. ORS 163.415. In addition, contributing\nto the sexual delinquency of a minor, which involves sex-\nual intercourse with a person under the age of 18, also is\na Class A misdemeanor. ORS 163.435. Sexual misconduct\nwith a person under the age of 18 is a Class C misdemeanor.\nORS 163.445. Second-degree custodial sexual misconduct,\nwhich involves sexual contact with a person in custody or\n\f390\t                                       State v. Davidson\n\non supervision by a supervisor, is a Class A misdemeanor.\nORS 163.454. Private indecency, which is similar to public\nindecency, except that it involves exposure of genitals at a\nlocation where the victim has a “reasonable expectation of\nprivacy,” similarly is a Class A misdemeanor. ORS 163.467.\nUnlawful dissemination of an intimate image, which can\nbe either a Class A misdemeanor or a felony, and involves\ndisclosure of intimate images on the internet for the pur-\npose of harassing, humiliating, or injuring another, is not\na “sex crime” for purposes of ORS 137.719(1). ORS 163.472.\nUnlawfully being in a location where children regularly\ncongregate, an offense that applies only to those previously\ndesignated as sexual offenders, is a Class A misdemeanor.\nORS 163.476. And finally, unlawful contact with a child,\nORS 163.479, another offense that applies only to offenders\nwho previously have committed sexual offenses, and which\ninvolves contact with a child “with the intent to commit a\ncrime or for the purpose of arousing or satisfying the sexual\ndesires of the person or another person,” is a Class C felony\nthat is not listed under ORS 163A.005(5) and therefore not\nsubject to ORS 137.719(1).\n\t         We have no difficulty in concluding that most of,\nif not all, the sexual offenses described above that are not\nwithin the purview of ORS 137.719(1)—and, thus, not subject\nto a presumptive true-life sentence—can be viewed as being\nat least as serious as public indecency. Indeed, the two that\nare arguably the most similar (because they involve noncon-\nsensual conduct for the purpose of arousing sexual desire)\nare private indecency, which involves intrusion into a place\nwhere a victim has a reasonable expectation of privacy, and\nthe type of sexual abuse that involves flinging blood, urine,\nsemen or feces at another person. Both those offenses are\nclassified as misdemeanors. In sum, in light of the other sex-\nual offenses set out in ORS chapter 163 and their respective\npenalties, we conclude that a life sentence without the pos-\nsibility of parole for public indecency is among the harshest\nsentences available under Oregon law when the gravity of\nthe offense is compared to the severity of the penalty.\n\t        We do not mean to suggest that the inclusion of pub-\nlic indecency in ORS 137.719(1) is facially unconstitutional.\nIndeed, we upheld the facial constitutionality of that statute\n\fCite as 360 Or 370 (2016)\t391\n\nin State v. Wheeler, 343 Or 652, 175 P3d 438 (2007). And,\nas noted, we rejected an as-applied challenge to a life sen-\ntence under that statute for public indecency most recently\nin Althouse, 359 Or 668. But where, as here, a criminal\ndefendant—even an incorrigible one—has a criminal his-\ntory that includes no offenses more serious than public inde-\ncency (and no other misconduct that otherwise supports a\nconclusion that he poses a significant physical danger to\nsociety), a sentence of life imprisonment without the possi-\nbility of parole for public indecency is unconstitutionally dis-\nproportionate under Article I, section 16.\n\t        The decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nThe judgment of the circuit court is affirmed in part and\nreversed in part, and the case is remanded to the circuit\ncourt for resentencing.\n\f</pre>",
