We affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       The following facts set the backdrop of this matter. We will provide additional facts as\n\nneeded in our discussion of the issues.\n\n       In 2001, Chicago, as owner and operator of O'Hare, proposed the O'Hare Modernization\n\nProgram (OMP), which would reconfigure and expand O'Hare's facilities, with the purpose of\n\nstreamlining air traffic and reducing flight delays. The primary measure in the OMP is the\n\ninstallation of parallel runways to replace O'Hare's existing body of intersecting runways, to which\n\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has attributed much of O'Hare's inefficiency. The OMP\n\noutlines a two-phased \"Master Plan\" for expansion. Phase 1 calls for the expansion of an existing\n\nrunway, the reconfiguration of taxiways and a concourse, and the construction of two new runways,\n\na new western satellite terminal, and an underground automated transit system or \"people mover\"\n\nconnecting the new satellite terminal with the main terminal.1 Phase 2 envisions the expansion of\n\nanother existing runway and the construction of two additional new runways as well as a \"world\n\ngateway terminal.\"\n\n       In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the O'Hare Modernization Act (Act) (620\n\nILCS 65/1 et seq. (West 2006)). In its prefatory findings, the legislature determined that \"O'Hare\n\ncannot efficiently perform its role in the State and national air transportation systems unless it is\n\nreconfigured with multiple parallel runways.\" 620 ILCS 65/5(a)(2) (West 2006). The legislature\n\nfound it \"essential\" that the OMP \"be completed efficiently and without unnecessary delay\" and that\n\n\"acquisition of property as required for the [OMP] be completed as expeditiously as practicable.\"\n\n620 ILCS 65/5(a)(6), (a)(7) (West 2006). To carry out Chicago's expansion efforts, it is empowered\n\n\n\n       1\n           An FAA document in the record states that construction of the western terminal is projected\n\nto be \"initiated\" during Phase l but is \"independent of other Phase 1 components.\"\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nby the Act to \"acquire by gift, grant, lease, purchase, [or] condemnation ***, or otherwise any right,\n\ntitle, or interest in any private property,\" including property outside Chicago's boundaries. 620 ILCS\n\n65/15 (West 2006). The Act allows acquisition of property \"that [Chicago] reasonably determines\n\nwill be necessary for future use, regardless of whether final regulatory or funding decisions have\n\nbeen made.\" (Emphasis added.) 620 ILCS 65/15 (West 2006). The Act also contains a broad\n\npreemption clause providing: \"Airport property shall not be subject to the laws of any unit of local\n\ngovernment except as provided by ordinance of [Chicago].\" 620 ILCS 65/25 (West 2006).\n\n       The OMP identifies 615 parcels in Bensenville that Chicago believes it must acquire in order\n\nto complete the expansion project at O'Hare. These parcels, situated off the southwest corner of\n\nO'Hare, are collectively identified by the OMP as the \"Southwest Acquisition Area\" (Acquisition\n\nArea). The properties in the Acquisition Area are variously improved with residential, commercial,\n\nand industrial structures. Plaintiffs all own properties in the Acquisition Area. Chicago has initiated\n\neminent domain proceedings against those properties. This suit, City of Chicago v. Forest Preserve\n\nDistrict of Du Page County, No. 06--ED--111, is pending before Judge Stephen J. Culliton in the\n\ncircuit court of Du Page County.2 As for the remaining properties in the Acquisition Area, it appears\n\nthat Chicago has acquired the great majority of them, though precisely how many is unclear. It also\n\nappears that some were acquired through eminent domain proceedings and some through voluntary\n\nsales, but again the respective numbers are not clear from the record.\n\n\n\n       2\n           The record does not clearly show whether all of the Residents have properties involved in\n\nthe Culliton proceeding or, moreover, whether any properties owned by Bensenville itself are\n\ninvolved. The parties appear to assume that the Residents and Bensenville all have properties at\n\nstake in the Culliton proceeding, and we proceed on that assumption.\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In 2006 and 2007, Chicago drafted plans for demolishing structures it acquired or planned\n\nto acquire in the Acquisition Area. Chicago also developed a \"Demolition Health and Safety Plan,\"\n\nwhich described Chicago's measures for insuring that the demolition would proceed without risk to\n\npublic safety.\n\n       On June 28, 2007, plaintiffs initiated the present action by filing a two-count complaint\n\nagainst Chicago. Count I sought a declaratory judgment that Chicago's demolition plans must\n\ncomply with Bensenville's recently enacted Demolition Ordinance, which provides detailed permit\n\nrequirements for all demolition within the Bensenville village limits. Bensenville Village Code\n\n§9--6a--2(F) (eff. February 27, 2008). The Demolition Ordinance provides that any application for\n\na demolition permit must include plans for replacing the structures planned for demolition.\n\nBensenville Village Code §9--6a--2(B) (eff. February 27, 2008). The Demolition Ordinance contains\n\na specific exception for Chicago's demolition of structures in the Acquisition Area, provided Chicago\n\ndemonstrates that the demolition is \"necessary\" to accomplish the OMP. Bensenville Village Code\n\n§9--6a--2(C)(2) (eff. February 27, 2008).\n\n       Count II of plaintiffs' complaint alleged that demolition under the plans proposed by Chicago\n\nwould constitute a public nuisance, as it would \"expose *** Bensenville residents and their families\n\nto toxic or hazardous substances and chemicals released by the demolition.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for an injunction barring Chicago from demolishing any\n\nproperties in the Acquisition Area during the pendency of the lawsuit. Plaintiffs alleged that Chicago\n\nplanned to demolish the properties without having quantified all potentially harmful substances in\n\nthe structures and soils of the properties or designed appropriate measures to control the release of\n\nsuch substances into the air or ground water during demolition. Plaintiffs attached to their motion\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nsworn declarations from Kenneth Mundt and Mark Travers, both employees of Environ, a firm\n\nretained by Bensenville to assess the health risks posed by demolition of structures in the Acquisition\n\nArea.\n\n        Mundt, an epidemiologist, averred in his declaration that the demolition as planned by\n\nChicago would \"create[] a significant potential endangerment to the health and safety of Bensenville\n\nresidents and their families.\" Mundt stated that he had reviewed Chicago's plan for controlling\n\nemissions of harmful substances during demolition and found it inadequate to protect either\n\ndemolition workers or Bensenville residents who live in the Acquisition Area or in the vicinity.\n\nMundt identified hazardous substances that are likely present in the structures or soils in the\n\nAcquisition Area:\n\n               \"Based on the mix of industrial, commercial, and residential structures in the\n\n        Acquisition Area (as well as the historical uses of the area), it is highly likely that the\n\n        following hazardous or toxic substances are present in the structures to be demolished (or in\n\n        the surrounding soils and groundwater):        lead, mercury, pesticides, insecticides and\n\n        herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical wood preservatives such as chromate\n\n        copper arsenate, pentachlorophenols, creosote, paint and solvent compounds containing\n\n        volatile organic compounds, petroleum wastes containing benzene and PAHs (polycyclic\n\n        aromatic hydrocarbons), pathogenic mold spores, and septic system wastes containing\n\n        bacterial and viral pathogens.\"\n\nMundt stated that these substances can, depending on their concentrations, cause \"severe adverse\n\nhealth effects including lung diseases, central nervous system damage, learning disabilities in\n\nchildren, cancer, birth defects, liver damage, and damage to reproductive systems.\" Mundt cautioned\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthat a full list of the hazardous substances in the Acquisition Area was not possible until the area was\n\ncomprehensively investigated and tested.\n\n       Mundt described a three-step process that he recommended be completed before demolition.\n\nThe first step is a comprehensive area-wide field investigation and sampling. This step involves\n\nidentifying \"the locations, types, and quantities of hazardous or toxic materials in and around the\n\nstructures to be demolished.\" Mundt contrasted this approach with Chicago's proposed method of\n\ntesting, which he criticized as \"start-stop\" because Chicago intended to test and demolish piecemeal\n\nrather than test the site in full before commencing demolition. Mundt opined that Chicago's method\n\nwas inadequate because it failed to consider the additive or cumulative effects of releases from\n\nmultiple parcels or structures.\n\n       The second step, according to Mundt, is to develop a baseline risk assessment, which\n\ninvolves using data from the field-testing stage to calculate the degree to which demolition will\n\nexpose to hazardous substances demolition workers and residents living in the Acquisition Area or\n\nits vicinity. If the exposure is likely to exceed \"accepted levels of public health protection,\" then\n\nstrict controls are necessary to reduce the exposure to acceptable levels. Mundt averred that, since\n\nChicago did not perform proper field testing, it necessarily could not have performed a proper risk\n\nassessment.\n\n       The third step, explained Mundt, is to establish \"sufficiently strict control measures\" to insure\n\nthat levels of exposure do not exceed \"accepted levels of public health protection.\" Mundt opined\n\nthat, since Chicago did not perform proper field testing or prepare a proper risk assessment, Chicago\n\nhas no basis for claiming that its demolition proposal will adequately protect public health.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In his declaration, Travers, a geologist, noted that Bensenville's Demolition Ordinance\n\nrequires an applicant for a demolition permit to submit plans for (in his words):                (1) \"a\n\ncomprehensive investigation of the location, type, and quantity of hazardous chemical[s] and\n\nmaterials in the entire area to be demolished\"; and (2) demolition controls that \"minimiz[e] the\n\npublic health risk from release of those hazardous chemicals during demolition.\" Travers opined that\n\nthe Demolition Ordinance \"is a carefully developed and organized set of requirements designed to\n\nprotect the public health and safety of Bensenville residents and their families from exposure to\n\nhazardous or toxic chemicals and materials that may be released during demolition activities.\"\n\nTravers averred that Chicago's compliance with the Demolition Ordinance was \"essential\" for public\n\nprotection.\n\n       At a July 2007 hearing on the motion for injunctive relief, the trial court held that count I did\n\nnot provide a basis for an injunction because plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits. The\n\ncourt reasoned that the Demolition Ordinance was preempted by section 25 of the Act, which\n\nprovides that \"[a]irport property shall not be subject to the laws of any unit of local government\n\nexcept as provided by ordinance of [Chicago].\" 620 ILCS 65/25 (West 2006). The court did,\n\nhowever, find a basis for injunctive relief in count II, alleging a public nuisance. The court entered\n\na preliminary injunction:\n\n       \"against [Chicago] on any further demolition of any kind or nature within [the Acquisition\n\n       Area] until an area-wide field investigation and sampling program is done identifying any\n\n       location, type and quantities of hazardous or toxic materials in or around the structures to be\n\n       demolished in the demolition area.\"\n\nAs for the duration of the injunction, the court said:\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       \"Once that area-wide field investigation and sampling program has been completed, then we\n\n       will hold an evidentiary hearing in regard to the findings that have been made, any expert\n\n       testimony that either Bensenville or [Chicago] may wish to put forth in open court, and any\n\n       other testimony that may be relevant in regard to same for this Court to make a determination\n\n       whether [the] preliminary injunction [should continue] *** or whether [it] [should] terminate\n\n       at that point with there being sufficient safeguards and protection for the public health of\n\n       those residents of Bensenville and the surrounding areas to satisfy this Court.\"\n\nThe court put the matter over for status.\n\n       In October 2007, plaintiffs filed a four-count amended complaint. Count I alleged common-\n\nlaw fraud, in that Chicago knowingly made to property owners in the Acquisition Area false\n\nstatements that all of their parcels are necessary for completion of the OMP. Plaintiffs alleged,\n\nwithout elaboration, that, \"[w]ith the exception of one parcel of property owned by [Bensenville],\"\n\nnone of the properties in the Acquisition Area are needed for Phase 1 of the OMP. Plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat only a portion of Phase 1 received the requisite approval from the \"Majority-In-Interest Airlines\"\n\n(MII Airlines) at O'Hare. Plaintiffs asserted that only Phase 2 could possibly warrant acquisition of\n\nplaintiffs' properties in the Acquisition Area but that Phase 2 was unlikely ever to be completed,\n\nbecause the MII Airlines probably would not approve Phase 2 given its projected cost. Plaintiffs\n\nasserted that Chicago knows that completion of Phase 2 is unlikely and that Phase 2 \"is little more\n\nthan a public relations creation by Chicago to provide a false justification for acquiring and\n\ndestroying the residential and commercial properties in the Acquisition Area.\"\n\n       Count II of the complaint pleaded constructive fraud based on the same false statements\n\nalleged in count I. Count III reasserted the first complaint's claim that the Demolition Ordinance\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ngoverns the demolition of properties in the Acquisition Area. Count IV realleged that the demolition\n\nwould constitute a public nuisance if it proceeded under the plans proposed by Chicago.\n\n       Chicago moved to dismiss counts I through III, pursuant to section 2--615 of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2--615 (West 2006)). The trial court granted the motion as to\n\ncounts I and II but not count III. The court dismissed count I on the grounds that: (1) Chicago's\n\nstatements as to Acquisition Area properties' necessity for the OMP were legal opinions based on\n\nstatutory or constitutional criteria for condemnation and therefore were not proper subjects of a fraud\n\naction, pursuant to Stern v. Norwest Mortgage, Inc., 284 Ill. App. 3d 506 (1996); (2) Chicago's\n\nstatements that it would use the properties for either Phase 1 or Phase 2 were statements of future\n\nintent and therefore not actionable as fraud (see People ex rel. Peters v. Murphy-Knight, 248 Ill. App.\n\n3d 382, 387 (1993) (\"[s]tatements regarding future events are considered opinions, not statements\n\nof fact,\" and therefore cannot be fraudulent)); (3) plaintiffs' alleged damages were \"speculative at\n\nbest\" because plaintiffs did not allege that Chicago had no intent to use the properties for Phase 1\n\nor Phase 2; and (4) relatedly, the lack of final approval for Phase 1 or Phase 2 did not vitiate\n\nChicago's ability to acquire the properties, because the Act allows acquisition of properties that\n\nChicago \"reasonably determines will be necessary for future use, regardless of whether final\n\nregulatory or funding decisions have been made\" (emphasis added) (620 ILCS 65/15 (West 2006)).\n\n       The court dismissed count II because plaintiffs set forth no facts that would prove \"the\n\nexistence of a fiduciary relationship between Chicago and Bensenville.\" In denying the motion to\n\ndismiss with respect to count III, the court reasoned that Chicago's sole contention was that the\n\nordinance was preempted by the Act, an affirmative matter not properly claimed in a section 2--615\n\nmotion. The court noted that the dismissal of counts I and II was without prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In November 2007, Chicago filed with the court a status report regarding its plans for\n\nsurveying and sampling the Acquisition Area as previously ordered by the court. Chicago informed\n\nthe court that it had retained the firm of Conestoga-Rovers and Associates (CRA) to conduct the\n\ninvestigation. The court set July 7, 2008, for an evidentiary hearing on whether the preliminary\n\ninjunction should continue.\n\n       On March 11, 2008, plaintiffs filed a five-count, second amended complaint. Count I of the\n\nsecond amended complaint was entitled \"Declaration and Injunctive Relief as to the Constitutionality\n\nof the O'Hare Modernization Act.\" In their foundational allegations, plaintiffs averred that Chicago\n\n\"has acquired--either through eminent domain or threat of eminent domain--several hundred ***\n\nresidential and commercial properties in Bensenville in the Acquisition Area.\" Plaintiffs further\n\nalleged that Chicago is currently seeking to acquire through eminent domain plaintiffs' own\n\nproperties.\n\n       Plaintiffs pleaded for two declarations. First, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Act does\n\nnot override the requirement of article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution, the takings clause,\n\nthat \"the courts *** decide after an evidentiary hearing whether any particular parcel is necessary\"\n\nfor a public purpose. See Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, §15 (\"Private property shall not be taken *** for\n\npublic use without just compensation as provided by law\"); People ex rel. Director of Finance v.\n\nYoung Women's Christian Ass'n, 86 Ill. 2d 219, 232 (1981) (YWCA) (the takings clause of the\n\nIllinois Constitution \" 'is a restraint and limitation placed upon the exercise of [the condemnation\n\npower] as against the right of the private citizen except in those cases where public necessity requires\n\nthe taking of private property for public use' \"), quoting Department of Public Works & Buildings\n\nv. Ryan, 357 Ill. 150, 154 (1934).\n\n\n\n                                                 -10-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Second, plaintiffs sought a declaration that Chicago did not satisfy the constitutional\n\nrequirement of necessity in \"taking\" properties in the Acquisition Area. In support, plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat only a portion of the OMP's Phase 1, i.e., the \"Phase 1 Airfield Project,\" was currently in\n\nprogress. Plaintiffs further alleged that, \"[w]ith the exception of a small number of properties on the\n\nnorth end of the so-called 'Acquisition Area,' Chicago has no need for any properties in Bensenville\n\nfor [Phase 1]--or the Phase 1 Airfield Project.\" With respect to Phase 2, plaintiffs averred that \"there\n\nis no certainty that [Phase 2] will be constructed within any reasonable period of time as required\n\nby the necessity limitations of the Illinois Constitution.\" Plaintiffs alleged that, \"despite this lack of\n\nnecessity for property in Bensenville, Chicago has acquired--through eminent domain proceedings\n\nor the threat of eminent domain--several hundred residential and commercial properties in\n\nBensenville on the false assertion that these properties are necessary\" for the OMP.\n\n        In addition to declaratory relief, plaintiffs asked that Chicago be ordered to restore \"to their\n\nprior state and condition\" the properties it \"acquired\" from the Acquisition Area. Plaintiffs also\n\nasked that Chicago be enjoined from \"further acquisitions\" of property in Bensenville \"under any\n\nclaim that the properties are necessary\" for the OMP, until Chicago proves its compliance with the\n\nconstitutional necessity requirement.\n\n        Count II pleaded common-law fraud. Plaintiffs made the following core allegations:\n\n                \"(A) False statement of material fact. Here the false statements of material fact are\n\n        Chicago's false factual allegations made to meet the necessity requirement of the Illinois\n\n        Constitution.\n\n                        i. That all of the properties in the Acquisition Area are needed for [Phase 1]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -11-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n             when at most only a few parcels are needed; the vast majority of Plaintiffs' properties\n\n             are not needed; and the vast majority of parcels in the Acquisition Area are not\n\n             needed for the 'Phase 1 Airfield Project' or any portion of [Phase 1].\n\n                     ii. That all of the properties in [the] Acquisition Area are needed for thefuture\n\n             [Phase 2] and that the necessity requirement of the Illinois Constitution is met\n\n             because [Phase 2] will be constructed by 2014. This statement of future need is false\n\n             because Chicago has no basis in fact to assert that [Phase 2] will be constructed by\n\n             2014 or any future date, if ever.\n\n             (B) Defendant's knowledge that the statement is false. Chicago knows that its\n\n      factual assertions as set forth in paragraph (A) are false.\n\n             (C) Defendant's intent that the false statement induce the Plaintiffs to act.\n\n      *** Here Chicago knew and intended its false factual statements as to necessity would cause\n\n      many property owners to sell their homes and businesses under threat of eminent domain.\n\n      The false statements by Chicago as to the facts--i.e., that Chicago had demonstrated a factual\n\n      basis of constitutional necessity in accordance with the Illinois Constitution's limitations on\n\n      the power of eminent domain--were made to property owners who sold their homes and\n\n      businesses under threat of eminent domain and to the DuPage [sic] County Circuit Court\n\n      which unwittingly accepted these assertions as the truth.\n\n             (D) Plaintiffs' reliance on the truth of the false statement. Here many--indeed\n\n      hundreds of property owners--sold their homes to Chicago under threat of eminent domain\n\n      in reliance on the truth of Chicago's false statements as to necessity to take their properties.\n\n      In turn by selling their homes in response to these false statements as to necessity, these\n\n\n\n                                                 -12-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       property owners (with the assistance and encouragement of Chicago) left the neighborhood\n\n       a deserted wasteland.\"\n\nPlaintiffs alleged as injuries that: (1) parts of the Acquisition Area have been turned into \"a virtual\n\nwasteland\" in that the acquired properties are uninhabited, and plaintiffs have suffered a resulting\n\n\"[l]ack of community\"; and (2) the loss of neighboring properties has diminished plaintiffs' property\n\nvalues and the reduction in the tax base has led to higher taxes.\n\n       Count III alleged unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs pleaded that \"Chicago has improperly and\n\nunjustly obtained and continue[s] to retain the use of the properties in the Acquisition Area by\n\nviolating the necessity limits of the Illinois Constitution and by false statements as to necessity.\"\n\n       Count IV realleged the claim from the prior complaints that demolition in the Acquisition\n\nArea was governed by the Demolition Ordinance. Count V realleged the public nuisance claim from\n\nthe prior complaints.\n\n       Plaintiffs also filed a motion for injunctive relief under counts I through III of the second\n\namended complaint. Also, under count V, plaintiffs sought the same injunctive relief that was\n\ncurrently in place. Plaintiffs did so to preserve the status quo in the event the court dissolved the\n\ninjunction at the July 2008 evidentiary hearing.\n\n       On April 11, 2008, Chicago moved to dismiss counts I and IV, pursuant to section 2--619\n\nof the Code (735 ILCS 5/2--619 (West 2006)), and counts II and III pursuant to section 2--615 of the\n\nCode. Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion. To particularize their allegations of fraud in count\n\nII, plaintiffs attached an affidavit from Joseph Del Balzo, former acting administrator of the FAA.\n\nDel Balzo averred that he reviewed documents relating to the OMP and found that Phase 1 requires\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nonly 33 properties in the Acquisition Area, not 615 properties as Chicago claimed. Del Balzo further\n\ndetermined that none of the documents indicates an estimated completion date for Phase 2.\n\n       On June 26, 2008, the trial court dismissed counts I and IV under section 2--619 and counts\n\nII and III under section 2--615. The court first addressed the grounds for dismissing counts I and IV.\n\nThe court construed count I as alleging \"that Chicago's acquisition of properties in Bensenville is\n\nunconstitutional because those properties are not necessary, as required by the Illinois Constitution.\"\n\nThe court proceeded from the premise that, \"[if] property is not necessary for [a] public project, there\n\nis no constitutional authority to take the property--despite what the Legislature has asserted in the\n\nauthorizing statute.\" The court distinguished between properties owned by plaintiffs, which Chicago\n\nis presently attempting to acquire in the proceedings before Judge Culliton, and all other properties\n\nin the Acquisition Area, which the court noted were \"owned by individuals who contracted with\n\nChicago for the sale of those properties.\"3\n\n       The trial court held that plaintiffs' claims respecting their own properties were barred on the\n\nground that there is \"another action pending between the same parties for the same cause\" (735 ILCS\n\n5/2--619(a)(3) (West 2006)), namely, the eminent domain action before Judge Culliton. The trial\n\ncourt found that the proceedings before Judge Culliton could provide plaintiffs \"complete relief\"\n\nwith respect to their own properties. As for the remaining properties, the trial court held that\n\nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge their acquisition by Chicago. The court noted plaintiffs'\n\nreliance on two cases, People ex rel. Klaeren v. Village of Lisle, 202 Ill. 2d 164 (2002), and Yusuf\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           This is contrary to plaintiffs' allegation, and the assumptions of the appellate briefs, that\n\nsome of these properties were acquired through eminent domain proceedings.\n\n                                                   -14-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nv. Village of Villa Park, 120 Ill. App. 3d 533 (1983), to establish standing, but the court found that\n\nplaintiffs alleged injuries unlike those in Yusuf or Klaeren.4\n\n       As for count IV, the court held that, in light of section 25 of the Act (620 ILCS 65/25 (West\n\n2006)) (\"Airport property shall not be subject to the laws of any unit of local government except as\n\nprovided by ordinance of [Chicago]\"), it is \"clear *** that any property acquired by the City of\n\nChicago for the purposes of OMP is not subject to the Bensenville Demolition Ordinance.\"\n\n       The court then turned to counts II and III, which alleged fraud and unjust enrichment,\n\nrespectively. On count II, the court reasoned:\n\n                 \"This court reaches the same conclusion it reached the last time plaintiffs presented\n\n       a fraud claim--the alleged damages are speculative at best. The acquired properties are to be\n\n       used for the benefit of the State of Illinois, and there is no evidence that Chicago plans to use\n\n       them for anything else.       Assurance as to future events is generally not considered\n\n       misrepresentation of fact. [Citation.] As such, Chicago's stated intention to use the acquired\n\n       properties for the [OMP] cannot be considered fraud. In addition, a legal position, even if\n\n       alleged to be wrong, is not fraud. [Citation.] Therefore, Chicago's legal position that it has\n\n       discretion (granted by the Illinois legislature) to determine what parcels of land it requires\n\n       for completion of the [OMP] cannot be considered a fraudulent statement.\"\n\nOn count III, the court said:\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Plaintiffs did not argue, and the trial court did not on its own consider, what standing\n\nBensenville might have as the municipality in whose territorial boundaries another government body\n\nseeks to acquire property by eminent domain.\n\n                                                 -15-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       \" 'To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must allege the defendant\n\n       unjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiff's detriment, and the defendant's retention violated\n\n       the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.' [Citation.] *** [T]here\n\n       is no fact pleading that supports the proposition that Chicago intends to use the acquired\n\n       properties for anything other than expansion of O'Hare. The properties are not for the benefit\n\n       of the City of Chicago. In addition, Chicago paid for each of the acquired properties in real\n\n       estate contracts with former owners of those properties. 'Where there is a specific contract\n\n       which governs the relationship of the parties, the doctrine of unjust enrichment has no\n\n       application.' [Citation.]\"\n\n       The court also denied, as moot, plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief under counts I through\n\nIII. On June 30, 2008, plaintiffs petitioned this court for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from\n\nthe denial of their motion. This court denied the petition.\n\n       On July 7-10, 2008, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on whether its injunction\n\nshould continue against demolition of the properties in the Acquisition Area. Chicago presented its\n\ncase first, and its first witness was Fred Blickle, an environmental engineer with CRA and an expert\n\nin developing and evaluating plans for the decommissioning and demolition of residential,\n\ncommercial, or industrial structures. Blickle explained that \"decommissioning\" is the process of\n\nremoving potentially hazardous material from a structure before demolishing it. Blickle testified that\n\nCRA was hired to perform an area-wide testing and investigation program in the Acquisition Area,\n\nto evaluate the results of the program, and to develop a decommissioning and demolition program\n\nthat would protect public health.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -16-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Blickle first explained the nature and scope of the testing and investigation. CRA inspected\n\nand sampled both structures and soils in the Acquisition Area. With respect to structures, CRA\n\ninspected \"600 plus\" parcels in the Acquisition Area and looked for any \"material[s] of concern that\n\nshould be decommissioned prior to demolition.\" CRA inspected the structures for lead and asbestos\n\nand for \"waste,\" subdivided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) into\n\nuniversal waste (fluorescent bulbs, batteries), household waste (cooking oils, cleaning agents,\n\npesticides), and hazardous waste (determined by a specialized test). CRA found materials containing\n\nasbestos. CRA did not test for lead in applied paint on the structures but, rather, assumed that there\n\nwas lead in all applied paint and planned to decommission the structures accordingly.\n\n       Blickle testified that CRA's inspection for waste included testing areas of concern, like\n\nstained concrete. This sampling was guided by the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. §2601\n\net seq. 2000)), which Blickle described as \"the only procedure prescribed by the [USEPA] for\n\nsampling solid materials.\" CRA gathered 4,400 samples in all and sent them to an independent lab\n\nto be tested for the presence of hazardous waste according to the criteria of the Resource\n\nConservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. §6901 et seq. (2000)). Blickle testified\n\nthat CRA found household and universal waste but no hazardous waste in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Blickle then explained CRA's methodology for soil sampling. CRA conducted two types of\n\nsampling: (1) sampling in areas of potential environmental concern (PECs); and (2) grid sampling.\n\nCRA identified PEC sites based on historical data showing the likely presence of contaminants in\n\nthe soil. Grid sampling consisted of random testing within a grid of acre-sized lots imposed on a\n\nmap of the Acquisition Area (with no overlap with PEC testing). Blickle testified that grid sampling\n\nwas not required by the USEPA but that CRA did it as an extra precaution. Blickle testified that\n\n\n\n                                                -17-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nCRA took samples at approximately 170 PEC sites and approximately 200 grid sites. About 400\n\ndiscrete samples were taken in all.5 CRA took samples at depths recommended by a document\n\nentitled \"Soil Screening Guidance: User's Guide,\" promulgated by the USEPA. CRA was not able\n\nto complete testing at 21 of the PEC sites because of \"access issues.\" Blickle testified that he was\n\nconfident that nothing was present at these 21 PEC sites that CRA had not already encountered\n\nelsewhere in the Acquisition Area. Blickle testified that CRA selected the chemicals for which to\n\ntest a PEC sample based on the contaminants, e.g., petroleum, that the usage history of the site\n\nindicated would likely be present in the soil. Blickle testified that grid samples were tested for\n\nsubstances listed on the Priority Pollutant List established by the Federal Water Pollution Control\n\nAct, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §1317 (2000)).\n\n       Blickle testified that the test results for each chemical were compared against the soil\n\nscreening level for that chemical. Blickle used soil screening levels developed by Dr. Elizabeth\n\nAnderson of Exponent Corporation. Blickle testified that Dr. Anderson's screening levels are\n\nconservative and that an exceedance does not necessarily indicate that disturbance of the soil will\n\nbe a risk to public health. Blickle testified that 99% of the PEC samples and 99% of the grid\n\nsamples were below the screening levels. Blickle testified that the exceedances that were found\n\nwould not preclude demolition, because CRA had measures to control emission of contaminants\n\nwithin levels acceptable for public safety.\n\n\n\n       5\n           There is some equivocation in the record between a \"parcel\" and a sampling \"site\" or\n\n\"location.\" From what we gather, CRA took samples at 370 \"locations\" or \"sites\" within the 615\n\nlegal parcels that comprise the Acquisition Area. A given parcel might contain more than one\n\nsampling site or location, and multiple samples might be taken at a given sampling site or location.\n\n                                               -18-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Blickle then described CRA's planned decommissioning procedures. Blickle testified that\n\nCRA intends to remove all waste that can be \"practically\" taken from the structures. As for asbestos,\n\nBlickle noted that the handling and disposition of materials containing asbestos is controlled by the\n\nNational Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (40 C.F.R. §61 et seq.\n\n(2008)), a series of federal regulations. Blickle explained that asbestos is of two types: \"Regulated\n\nAsbestos Containing Material\" (RACM) and non-RACM.                      The USEPA and the Illinois\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (IEPA) both must be notified of the presence of RACM in a\n\nstructure designated for demolition. Prior to demolition, RACM must be entirely removed from the\n\nstructure by a demolition contractor licensed in asbestos abatement. Non-RACM need not be\n\nremoved prior to demolition. Blickle explained that, though such a measure is not required by law,\n\nCRA will dismantle rather than crush or implode structures containing non-RACM. As for lead,\n\nCRA will assume that all applied paint contains lead and will remove all flaked or flaking paint.\n\n        Blickle next described the demolition controls that CRA developed to keep emissions of\n\ncontaminants to safe levels during demolition. CRA will enclose the demolition area to exclude the\n\npublic and will maintain a \"buffer zone\" between the demolition area and occupied properties. CRA\n\nwill apply water to all structures to control release of dust and will use silk screens to filter the water\n\nrunning off the structures. Blickle characterized the wetting of structures as CRA's \"primary\" control\n\non dust. CRA will also vacuum around the structures with a device designed to catch particles down\n\nto .3 microns in size. In addition, CRA will implement a \"real time\" air monitoring program in an\n\neffort to confine \"visible dust\" to the demolition area, per the dictates of the NESHAP. CRA will\n\nmonitor airborne asbestos according to the standards of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response\n\nAct of 1986 (AHERA) (15 U.S.C. §2461 et seq. (2000)) and lead levels according to the National\n\n\n\n                                                   -19-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nPrimary & Secondary Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (40 C.F.R. §50.1 et seq. (2008)).\n\nCRA derived from the AHERA and the NAAQS certain \"action\" and \"trigger\" levels for lead and\n\nasbestos. If an action level is exceeded, CRA will take corrective measures while continuing\n\ndemolition. If a trigger is exceeded, CRA will cease demolition altogether until it achieves\n\ncompliance with the emission standards. In addition to the foregoing, CRA will monitor the air for\n\nvolatile organic compounds. Blickle admitted that CRA will not monitor for substances other than\n\nlead, asbestos, and volatile organic compounds. Blickle explained that demolition teams \"never\n\nmonitor for every constituent that's present, no matter what the site.\" The custom rather is to \"select\n\ntarget compounds, indicator parameters to gauge your monitoring program.\"\n\n        Blickle testified that CRA will further minimize soil disturbance by demolishing just to the\n\n\"pad\" or slab of a structure and by filling basements with concrete rather than digging out the walls.\n\nBlickle opined that CRA's demolition controls will insure that no \"appreciable\" deposition of\n\nchemicals will occur in residential areas inside or outside the demolition area. Blickle admitted that\n\nCRA made no quantitative estimate of \"what would come off the site during demolition.\" CRA saw\n\nno need to make that calculation, because its controls \"are protective of any type of generation of that\n\nmaterial\" and it did not believe \"anything is going to come off\" the site during demolition.\n\n        Blickle acknowledged an October 31, 1997, letter from the IEPA to Nelson Steel & Wire,\n\nwhich had occupied in the Acquisition Area a parcel that is now the site of Pro Logis. The letter\n\nimplies that at the site there had been some environmental issue for which remediation had been\n\nrequired. The letter refers to presently contaminated soil at the site but states that \"no further\n\nremediation\" is required at the site as long as certain terms are followed. The letter states in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n\n\n                                                  -20-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      \"PREVENTIVE, ENGINEERING, AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS\n\n      3.

Dr. Anderson testified\n\nthat a proper assessment of the risk posed by a proposed demolition has three steps: (1)\n\ncharacterizing the demolition site, which involves identifying chemicals of potential concern; (2)\n\nidentifying potential receptors of emissions and pathways of exposure, such as inhalation and\n\ningestion; and (3) determining the overall risk on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nThe aim of the risk assessment approach is to insure that contaminants are not released in levels that\n\ncan threaten public health.\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, in her professional opinion, Blickle's plan for decommissioning\n\nthe structures, controlling dust, and monitoring for lead and asbestos was suitably protective of\n\npublic health. To evaluate the risk posed by soil disturbance, Dr. Anderson used a specialized risk\n\n\n\n                                                  -22-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nassessment paradigm called the \"screening level approach,\" which is approved by both the USEPA\n\nand the IEPA. Dr. Anderson explained that the aim of the screening level approach is to calculate\n\nthe maximum soil concentration at which a substance, if released during a soil disturbance, will not\n\nendanger public health. Dr. Anderson drew her soil screening levels from the baseline values\n\nprovided in the \"Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives\" (TACO) (35 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n§742.100 et seq., adopted at 21 Ill. Reg. 7942, eff. July 1, 1997, as amended) promulgated by the\n\nIEPA.6 Dr. Anderson explained that TACO assumes that there has been both \"a hazardous release\"\n\nand \"an enforcement action\" and, accordingly, prescribes soil screening levels by which to plan\n\nappropriate corrective action. TACO may also be used \"voluntarily,\" as she did here, where the issue\n\nis the risk involved in a prospective soil disturbance. Dr. Anderson testified that TACO soil\n\nscreening levels are calculated differently for carcinogenic substances than for noncarcinogenic\n\nsubstances. Under TACO, exposure to carcinogenic substances must not cause greater than a 1 in\n\n1 million (1 x 10-6) chance of developing cancer over one's lifetime. Risk associated with\n\nnoncarcinogenic substances, however, is measured not as a probability but as a hazard quotient, or\n\n\"the ratio of the expected exposure to the regulatory limit.\" Under TACO, the hazard quotient for\n\nnoncarcinogenic substances must not exceed one.\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that TACO considers the risk that demolition poses to both demolition\n\nworkers and adjacent residents. TACO provides three tiers of screening values. Tier 1 provides\n\n\n\n       6\n           It became apparent in later testimony that Dr. Anderson provided screening levels for\n\nchemicals she considered relevant to the risk analysis and did so independently of Blickle's test\n\nresults. Therefore, it was possible that Dr. Anderson calculated screening levels for chemicals that\n\nBlickle never detected.\n\n                                               -23-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nscreening values for a certain baseline scenario, and Tiers 2 and 3 allow for modification of those\n\nvalues if the circumstances of a chemical release from soils differ materially from the Tier 1\n\nscenario. Dr. Anderson explained that Tier 1 presupposes a release of contaminants due to a \"very\n\ngentle soil disturbance.\" Tier 1 also presupposes an exposure duration of 30 years for adjacent\n\nresidents and 30 days for demolition workers. Dr. Anderson modified the Tier 1 scenario in several\n\nways. First, she assumed, commensurate with the length of the planned demolition, that both\n\nresidents and demolition workers in the Acquisition Area would be exposed to released chemicals\n\nfor 260 days. Dr. Anderson testified that the baseline 30-year exposure for residents was not realistic\n\nin this case because contaminants were found at \"very low levels\" in the Acquisition Area and\n\nBlickle's demolition controls would forestall any \"large depositions that would then cause long term\n\nrisk.\"\n\n         Second, Dr. Anderson assumed a greater soil disturbance than the baseline Tier 1 scenario\n\nand in fact employed a \"Particulate Emission Factor\" (PEF) 10 times more conservative than the Tier\n\n1 default factor.\n\n         Third, as a precautionary measure, Dr. Anderson assumed that residents in the Acquisition\n\nArea would inhale released contaminants to the same degree as demolition workers. Dr. Anderson\n\ndid not, however, assume any ingestion of contaminants by residents as she did for demolition\n\nworkers, because ingestion by residents was unlikely given the degree of Blickle's controls.\n\n         The fourth manner in which Dr. Anderson departed from Tier 1 was to use an additive risk\n\nanalysis according to the guidelines of Tier 3. Dr. Anderson explained that an additive risk analysis\n\nconsiders the combined effect of exposure to multiple contaminants. Dr. Anderson emphasized that\n\nthe additive risk analysis considers \"contaminants detected--not suspected, not possibilities.\" Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                 -24-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nAnderson also emphasized that the additive risk analysis considers separately the effects of\n\nnoncarcinogenic and carcinogenic substances; TACO does not permit the combining of carcinogenic\n\nand noncarcinogenic effects into a single risk value. Finally, the additive risk analysis segregates\n\neffects to different parts of the body. Dr. Anderson testified that the screening levels resulting from\n\nher adjustments were more rigorous overall than even the conservative Tier 1 levels.\n\n          Dr. Anderson then described Blickle's test results and his comparison of them to her\n\nscreening levels.     Dr. Anderson noted that Blickle's test results showed \"very, very low\"\n\nconcentrations of contaminants in the Acquisition Area. Blickle took these concentrations and did\n\na \"chemical by chemical\" analysis, comparing each chemical to its screening level. Blickle found\n\nexceedances at 41 of the 370 locations he sampled. When Dr. Anderson did her own comparison\n\nusing the additive risk model, she found exceedances at only 11 locations sampled. Dr. Anderson\n\nattributed this somewhat counterintuitive disparity to the specialized nature of additive risk analysis\n\nunder TACO. For one, additive risk separates effects peculiar to discrete body parts; there is no\n\n\"mixing of body parts.\" Furthermore, under TACO, \"the cumulative risk of carcinogens [sic]\n\ncontaminants attacking the same target must not exceed 1 x 10-4,\" not the standard benchmark of 1\n\nx 10-6.\n\n          Dr. Anderson testified that, in an effort to be \"more public health protective,\" Blickle\n\ndesigned his controls based on the 41 site-exceedances derived from his chemical-by-chemical\n\nanalysis, not on the lower number of exceedances reached in Dr. Anderson's additive risk analysis.\n\nDr. Anderson noted that, of the 41 exceedance sites, no soil disturbance causing a release would\n\noccur at 25 of the sites because either there are no structures at all on those sites or the soil that is\n\ncontaminated is located below asphalt or concrete that will be undisturbed during demolition. Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                  -25-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nAnderson testified that another 12 of the 41 locations showed exceedances only for arsenic and\n\nbenzo(a)pyrene, and these were in concentrations at acceptable background levels that TACO sets\n\nfor chemicals found \"frequently in the environment.\" On yet another site, \"the limits of detection\n\nwere above the risk-base soil concentration levels,\" and Blickle \"had very generally just included [it]\n\nas a positive sample even though it was never detected.\" Thus, there remained just three sampling\n\nlocations with unmitigated exceedances.\n\n       Asked if CRA had taken enough samples at each sampling location to be confident that it had\n\nmeasured the highest concentration of each contaminant found at the location, Dr. Anderson\n\nanswered:\n\n               \"I suppose Mr. Blickle could have sampled every square inch. But that's not the point\n\n       of a sampling program.\n\n               The point of [a] sampling program is to capture the representative samples in a\n\nlocation.\"\n\nDr. Anderson further defended CRA's sampling program:\n\n               \"If you're doing a focus sampling plan and you're trying to sample particularly the\n\n       point where you think the concentration is going to be the highest and you don't really find\n\n       anything that is of enormous concern--we did not find huge levels of contamination at this\n\n       site--and then to proceed further to establish protective measures, I don't think you\n\n       necessarily need to establish sampling plans that just continue to sample and to sample and\n\n       to sample, when at this site, as I said ***, we really don't find that many enormous concerns.\n\n               We found very, very, few samples that exceeded the screening levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -26-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that CRA did not intend to remove the protective barrier in place at\n\nthe Nelson Wire/Pro Logis site, but, if there were a soil disturbance, \"it would need to be addressed\n\nwith the [IEPA].\"\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, in her professional opinion, the demolition planned by CRA will\n\nnot threaten public health because CRA's plan for decommissioning the Acquisition Area is\n\ncomprehensive and sound, the soil in the Acquisition Area has low concentrations of contaminants,\n\nand the demolition controls designed by CRA will adequately control emission of contaminants from\n\nthe structures and soils.\n\n       Plaintiffs' first witness was Stanley Popelar, a geologist and expert in site assessment\n\nemployed by Environ. Popelar's testimony was focused primarily on CRA's soil sampling program,\n\nwhich he found inadequate. Popelar emphasized first that soil samples were taken at a relatively\n\nsmall number of legal parcels in the Acquisition Area. Popelar noted that CRA took samples at only\n\n147 of the 615 parcels in the Acquisition Area. Moreover, CRA identified 61 PEC parcels but took\n\nsamples at only 37.7\n\n       Popelar criticized CRA's general sampling methodology. Popelar testified that CRA's PEC\n\nsampling concentrated almost exclusively on commercial and industrial properties even though\n\nresidential properties regularly contain such contaminants as lead from paint, pesticides, chemicals\n\n\n\n       7\n           Again, the testimony at the hearing draws a distinction between a parcel and a sampling\n\nlocation. As seen from Blickle's testimony, CRA often identified more than one sampling location\n\nwithin a given parcel and often took more than one discrete sample within a sampling location. Still,\n\nit is difficult to reconcile Blickle's testimony that only 24 PEC sampling sites remained to be tested\n\nwith Popelar's testimony that 37 legal parcels remained for PEC testing.\n\n                                                -27-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nfor treating lumber, heating oil residue, and household wastes. Popelar asserted that this deficiency\n\nin the PEC sampling was not remedied by the grid sampling, which also did not cover all residential\n\nproperties in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Popelar also criticized CRA's methodology with respect to the sites it did sample. Popelar\n\nnoted that, once CRA found a sample in a given location that tested positive for a contaminant, CRA\n\ndid not \"step out\" from the point of the sample, i.e., take further samples to determine the total\n\nquantity of that contaminant at the sampling location. Popelar testified that, without knowing the\n\ntotal quantity of a contaminant in an area, one cannot know what quantity of that contaminant will\n\nbe released during a soil disturbance, and, without knowing emission levels, one cannot design\n\nappropriate emission controls. Popelar also opined that CRA did not bore deeply enough when\n\ntaking samples. Additionally, in the residential properties that were grid-sampled, CRA \"typically\n\nput the soil borings out in the middle of the yard in areas [where CRA was] least likely to find\n\ncontamination, not near the structures, not near [the] sources of residential contaminants.\"\n\n       Popelar maintained that, though underground septic and heating oil tanks are common in\n\nresidential properties in the Acquisition Area, CRA did not search for such tanks in many of the\n\nresidential areas. Popelar identified specifically a residential area north of Irving Park Road in\n\nBensenville that CRA had not surveyed for septic or heating oil tanks.\n\n       Popelar concluded that CRA's sampling was \"not area-wide\" or \"comprehensive\" and that\n\nCRA failed to \"identify the maximum concentrations present and/or the quantities they might be\n\ndealing with.\" Popelar admitted that Environ did not take its own samples from the Acquisition\n\nArea. Robert Adams, also employed by Environ, testified that he has experience in developing and\n\nevaluating decommissioning and demolition plans. Adams testified that the basic shortcoming in\n\n\n\n                                                -28-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nCRA's demolition controls is that they are based on incomplete data. Adams observed that a large\n\nnumber of residential properties have not been sampled by CRA.           Even with respect to the\n\nproperties it has sampled, CRA has \"done no assessment or review to determine what kinds of\n\nemissions will be coming off the site during the demolition process.\" Because \"you need to know\n\nwhat is going to come off of the site [during demolition] to determine what the necessary controls\n\nare,\" CRA has no basis for claiming that its controls will limit emissions within levels consistent\n\nwith public health.\n\n       Adams also questioned aspects of CRA's air monitoring program. Adams asserted that\n\nCRA's monitoring system was not sufficiently comprehensive because asbestos, lead, and volatile\n\ncompounds are not reliable proxies for other contaminants, contrary to CRA's position. Adams also\n\nclaimed that CRA's lead monitoring instruments are not sensitive enough to detect emissions at\n\nCRA's proposed action and trigger levels.\n\n       Adams admitted that he has not taken samples from, or otherwise investigated or examined,\n\nthe Acquisition Area. He also admitted that he himself has made no estimate of the emission levels\n\nfor any contaminant that could be released during demolition.\n\n       Dr. Frank Jones, a toxicologist at Environ and an expert in risk assessment, testified to the\n\nmultiple points on which he disagreed with Dr. Anderson's screening level approach. First, Dr. Jones\n\ndisagreed with Dr. Anderson's rejection of ingestion as a possible pathway of exposure for residents\n\ninside or outside the Acquisition Area. Second, Dr. Jones challenged Dr. Anderson's PEF. Dr. Jones\n\nstated that TACO's baseline PEF is the \"Cowherd factor,\" which assumes \"just bare exposed soil\n\nwith wind blowing across the soil.\" Dr. Jones noted that Dr. Anderson, to account for the greater\n\nsoil agitation caused by demolition, simply multiplied the Cowherd factor by 10. Dr. Jones opined\n\n\n\n                                               -29-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthat, though TACO mandates multiplying the baseline factor by 10, there is no scientific basis for\n\nchoosing 10 as the multiplier. Dr. Jones dismissed TACO's enhanced PEF as \"simplistic\" and noted\n\nthat the USEPA has developed more sophisticated emissions factors.\n\n       Third, Dr. Jones asserted that Dr. Anderson was mistaken in substituting an exposure\n\nduration of 260 days for the 30-year default duration in TACO Tier 1. Dr. Jones explained that the\n\ndefault standard assumes that contaminants will travel from a demolition area into adjoining\n\nresidential areas and, once deposited, will cause continual exposure until dissipated or transported\n\nelsewhere. Dr. Anderson made the substitution because she believed there would be no deposition\n\nof material that could have long-term ill effects. Dr. Jones criticized this belief as unfounded\n\nbecause CRA had not measured the quantity of each contaminant in the soil and therefore had an\n\nincomplete picture of emission levels or deposition amounts. Dr. Jones cited a body of literature\n\nfinding that, even with \"dust suppression\" controls in place, demolition of structures causes\n\n\"significant levels of deposition of dust\" outside the demolition area. Dr. Jones concluded that Dr.\n\nAnderson had no cause for departing from the default exposure duration in TACO Tier 1. Dr. Jones\n\nadmitted, however, that the prevailing winds in the vicinity of the Acquisition Area blow from the\n\nsouthwest. Thus, the Acquisition Area, situated between O'Hare to the northeast and the remaining\n\nsections of Bensenville to the west and southwest, is mostly downwind from the other areas of\n\nBensenville.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that, though he disagreed with Dr. Anderson's screening levels, he did not\n\ncalculate his own screening levels but used Dr. Anderson's to perform an additive risk analysis that\n\nconsiders the combined effect of multiple agents. Dr. Jones employed the additive risk approach of\n\na USEPA document entitled \"Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Volume I, Human Health\n\n\n\n                                               -30-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nEvaluation Manual\" (RAGS). The method of the RAGS involves dividing \"your acceptable risk\n\nlevel by the number of potential chemicals that your--that you may have present at the site.\" Dr.\n\nJones stressed that he considered the additive effects of carcinogens separately from the additive\n\neffects of noncarcinogens; he agreed that the RAGS does not allow one \"to take the noncancer risk\n\nand add it to the cancer risk to determine the total risk.\" Dr. Jones testified that he calculated the\n\nrespective additive risks for carcinogens and noncarcinogens by first adding together all screening\n\nlevels Dr. Anderson provided, which yielded a total screening level. He then divided this figure, in\n\nthe case of noncarcinogens, by 120 (the total number of chemicals for which Dr. Anderson provided\n\nscreening levels), and, in the case of carcinogens, by 50 (the total number of carcinogenic chemicals\n\nfor which Dr. Anderson provided screening levels). The higher divisor for noncarcinogens was\n\nnecessary because \"all chemicals have a noncarcinogenic effect, whether they are a carcinogen or\n\na noncarcinogen.\" Dr. Jones acknowledged that he divided the total screening value not \"by the\n\nchemicals actually detected\" but by \"the total number of chemicals for which [Dr. Anderson]\n\nprovided a screening level.\"8 He noted that, \"even if it was nondetected, [a] chemical might still\n\nhave been of concern.\" He explained in the following colloquy:\n\n                 \"Q. You used *** the substances that were listed in Dr. Anderson's table [of\n\n       screening values] did you not?\n\n                 A. That is correct.\n\n                 Q. And you mentioned that some of the chemicals she had listed came back as\n\n       nondetect; isn't that right?\n\n\n\n       8\n           It is implied here that Dr. Anderson created her list of screening values independently of\n\nwhat Blickle detected in the Acquisition Area.\n\n                                                 -31-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n               A. That is what I've been told this morning.\n\n               Q. Okay. And one of the problems with nondetect is that the sensitivity level of the\n\n       chemistry may be above the level of health concern; isn't that right?\n\n               A. That is--in the field of risk assessment, if you have a detection limit that is higher\n\n       than your health-based concern, you would assume that the chemical might still be there at\n\n       half the detection level.\n\n               Q. Because the limits of the chemical lab may be, you have the chemical there and\n\n       a health risk, but the laboratory isn't able to analyze it; is that correct?\n\n               A. Exactly.\"\n\nDr. Jones claimed that TACO dictates the same divisors as the RAGS for an additive risk analysis.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that, under the additive risk analysis of the RAGS, he found exceedances\n\nat 52 of CRA's sampling locations, compared to Blickle's 41 exceedances. If he had used the\n\nunmodified TACO Tier 1 values (a risk limit of 1 x 10-6, exposure through both ingestion and\n\ninhalation, and an exposure duration of 30 years), he would have found exceedances at \"most\" of\n\nCRA's sampling locations. Dr. Jones noted that, under TACO, if an additive risk analysis yields\n\nscreening values more rigorous than the Tier 1 values, \"the number[s] would default back to the Tier\n\n1 number[s].\" Dr. Jones considered this proviso in TACO \"policy-based\" not \"health-based.\" If not\n\nfor it, an additive risk analysis using the strict Tier 1 values would yield exceedances at every\n\nsampling location in the Acquisition Area. Dr. Jones admitted that he was \"supposed to calculate\n\nadditive risk by target organ\" but did not do so.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that there were \"too many gaps\" in CRA's data for Chicago to conclude\n\nthat the demolition would not endanger public health. Particularly, CRA failed to calculate the total\n\n\n\n                                                 -32-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nquantities of contaminants found at each sampling location. Without this knowledge, CRA could\n\nnot develop appropriate demolition controls because, \"if you don't know what's there, you can't\n\ncontrol for it.\" Dr. Jones acknowledged that it is acceptable to obtain the average concentration of\n\na contaminant at a sampling location as long as the range of sampling is broad enough. CRA,\n\nhowever, did not attempt to find the average concentration at any sampling location.\n\n        Michael Paige, a Bensenville official responsible for insuring compliance with the village's\n\ncodes, testified that he met with Chicago officials to discuss the proposed demolition. During these\n\nmeetings, he informed Chicago officials about the likelihood of underground storage tanks and septic\n\nfields in the residential areas north of Irving Park Road. Paige also testified that, as of the hearing,\n\n13 residential parcels in the Acquisition Area were still occupied.\n\n        Kenneth Mundt, who had submitted a sworn declaration in support of plaintiffs' original\n\nmotion for injunctive relief, testified that he was the leader of the team of Environ employees who\n\nevaluated CRA's proposed decommissioning and demolition procedures. Mundt and his team tested\n\nCRA's work against the risk assessment framework Mundt had laid out in his sworn declaration.\n\nThis three-stage method consists of: (1) conducting a \"comprehensive area-wide sampling plan,\"\n\nwhich involves measuring the \"concentration, quantity[,] and type of contaminants\" in the area\n\ndesignated for demolition and calculating the extent to which the demolition will expose demolition\n\nworkers, and residents in the vicinity, to contaminants; (2) determining whether the likely exposure,\n\nif any, is consistent with acceptable levels of public health protection; and (3) developing measures\n\nto limit exposure to within acceptable levels. Mundt testified that step one is \"critical\" for the others\n\nbecause if \"good scientific data\" is lacking, \"whatever controls are based on [the] improper risk\n\nassessment might not be adequately protective.\"\n\n\n\n                                                  -33-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Mundt opined that CRA did not conduct step one properly. Mundt asserted that CRA's\n\nsurvey of the demolition site was deficient because CRA did not take PEC samples at all residential\n\nproperties, where the soils likely contained pesticides and lead from exterior paint. Mundt also noted\n\nthat CRA did not test for pesticides in any grid or PEC sample even though they were likely present\n\nin the Acquisition Area. Mundt considered these gaps in data \"irresponsible.\" Also, Mundt\n\nconsidered grid sampling intrinsically flawed as a sampling methodology because it is not directed\n\nby historical property use. Mundt testified that he did not consider grid sampling appropriate \"for\n\nany purpose\" and did not believe that the USEPA approves grid sampling.\n\n       Mundt criticized CRA's sampling program for the additional reason that it did not utilize\n\n\"stepping out\" sampling. Mundt noted that \"stepping out\" sampling is important because, \"[i]f levels\n\nof contaminants exceed certain thresholds, we would then want to know whether we were at the very\n\nedge of the contaminated area, [or] at the center of it.\" \"Stepping out\" sampling \"confirm[s] what\n\nthe highest concentrations are of a particular contaminant of concern as well as the quantity of the\n\nparticular contaminant of concern.\" Mundt admitted that he is not trained in soil sampling and has\n\nnever taken soil samples himself. Mundt also admitted that Environ did no soil sampling of its own\n\nbut simply critiqued CRA's methods.         Mundt concluded that, because CRA's sampling was\n\ninadequate, there was insufficient data \"to make a scientifically or technically supportable judgment\n\nthat going forward with the demolition at this time would not pose a significant health risk\" to\n\nresidential areas in or near the Acquisition Area.\n\n       In rebuttal, Chicago called Dr. Anderson, who addressed Dr. Jones' criticisms of her risk\n\nassessment methods and also critiqued his proposed methods. Dr. Anderson testified that a proper\n\nrisk assessment of the planned demolition in the Acquisition Area did not require her to measure the\n\n\n\n                                                -34-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ntotal quantity of each contaminant in a sampling location because she used a soil disturbance model\n\nthat assumed \"limitless amounts of contaminant in the soil.\" Referencing Dr. Jones' additive risk\n\nmethod, Dr. Anderson asserted that she knows of no government agency that prescribes including\n\n\"suspected\" or \"non-detected\" chemicals in the divisor for additive risk analysis. Dr. Anderson\n\nsuggested that such a method is \"arbitrary\" and \"make[s] no sense.\" Dr. Anderson followed instead\n\nTACO's additive risk method, which provides that the divisor need include only chemicals \"actually\n\ndetected at the site.\" Dr. Anderson noted that Dr. Jones, by his own admission, did not \"develop his\n\nscreening levels based on target organs.\" Dr. Anderson suggested that Dr. Jones' analysis was further\n\nflawed because \"he combined the cancer risk and the non-cancer risk to the same chemical to come\n\nup with his screening level.\"\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, since her testimony in Chicago's case-in-chief, she recalculated\n\nher screening levels using straightforward Tier 1 factors and found exceedances at 37 sampling\n\nlocations. Dr. Anderson testified that this was the same number of exceedances Popelar found when\n\nhe applied Dr. Jones' screening levels.\n\n       In surrebuttal, Dr. Jones testified that, since his testimony in plaintiffs' case-in-chief, he redid\n\nhis additive risk model using the number of chemicals detected, not merely suspected. The result\n\nwas still a set of screening levels that fell below TACO Tier 1 baseline norms (but that defaulted to\n\nthe Tier 1 standards due to TACO's reversionary clause). Dr. Jones admitted that he combined the\n\ncarcinogenic risk with the noncarcinogenic risk for at least three chemicals for which he provided\n\nscreening levels. Dr. Jones claimed that this was an \"inadvertent\" error and that he was \"a little\n\nsloppy\" in calculating his screening levels. Dr. Jones noted that, for the three examples he identified,\n\nthe noncarcinogenic risk had such a low value that it added virtually nothing to the carcinogenic risk.\n\n\n\n                                                  -35-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       On August 7, 2008, in a lengthy written opinion, the trial court dissolved the preliminary\n\ninjunction against Chicago's demolition of structures in the Acquisition Area. The trial court began\n\nwith a general overview of the evidence:\n\n               \"The Defendant, City of Chicago, presented two expert witnesses, Mr. Fred Blickle\n\n       of Conestoga-Rovers and Associates ('CRA') and Dr. Elizabeth Anderson of Exponent, Inc.\n\n       ('Exponent'), in support of its position: (i) that proper precautionary measures will be taken\n\n       during demolition to prevent unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful materials in the\n\n       Acquisition Area; (ii) that Plaintiffs' contention that the Acquisition Area presents significant\n\n       uncontrollable risks to public health is without foundation; and (iii) that Plaintiffs' claims of\n\n       endangerment were not only inaccurate and speculative at the time they were made\n\n       (particularly since they were not based on any investigation, sampling, testing, or modeling\n\n       of the Acquisition Area by the Plaintiffs), but[,] moreover[,] have no legitimate evidentiary\n\n       basis, now that there has been extensive area-wide investigation and sampling of the\n\n       Acquisition Area.\n\n               The Plaintiff[s], Village of Bensenville et al., countered with their position as\n\n       presented by their four expert witnesses, Mr. Stanley Popelar, Dr. Frank Jones, Mr. Robert\n\n       Adams, and Dr. Kenneth Mundt, all of ENVIRON International Corporation ('ENVIRON'),\n\n       that it is premature to determine whether there will be endangerment to the public health,\n\n       because more investigation and sampling must first be done in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Although Plaintiffs' experts acknowledged that they have not investigated, sampled[,] or\n\n       tested the Acquisition Area at any time and consequently have no data of their own on which\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -36-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       to base their contentions ***, Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that no demolition activities can\n\n       now proceed.\"\n\n       To illustrate what it considered the pith of the controversy between the parties, the trial court\n\ncollected the following subject headings from plaintiffs' proposed order and findings of fact:\n\n       \"A.

The area-wide field\n\n       investigation and sampling program that I ordered Chicago to complete was in fact\n\n       completed.\n\n               I was privileged to hear the expert testimony of both Plaintiff's [sic] and Defendant's\n\n       [sic] over the course of the four day hearing. Through that testimony, I 'became educated'\n\n       in regard to the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; the Illinois\n\n       EPA; the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the Asbestos\n\n       'NESHAP'; regulated ACM and non RACM; the Asbestos Hazardous Emergency Response\n\n       Act ('AHERA'); the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Lead ('NAAQS'); risk\n\n\n\n                                                -38-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      assessment procedures promulgated by the IEPA in its regulatory program called 'Tiered\n\n      Approach to Corrective Action Objectives,' Tier 1 and Tier 3 ('TACO'); as well as the Illinois\n\n      EPA's previously issued No Further Remediation Letter ('NFR') on October 31, 1997,\n\n      pertaining to the ProLogis site contained within the demolition area.\n\n             I now see that there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can\n\n      oversee this demolition project. In my opinion any further oversight by the Court would be\n\n      done without proper authority.\n\n             By this Court attempting to exceed it's [sic] authority and to go in and oversee the\n\n      entire environmental activities for the proposed demolitions would make this Court a\n\n      revolving door for the parties to constantly come in requesting the Court to evaluate and\n\n      review the various continuing steps and missteps which might occur in the demolition\n\n      process. This Court would be called upon to be a self-imposed 'environmental protection\n\n      agency' and/or risk assessment manager that would be constantly micromanaging the\n\n      demolition process and having numerous hearings with differing experts [sic] opinions on\n\n      what should and shouldn't be done at each step of the process.\n\n             That would leave the Court to impose its own judgment pertaining to environmental\n\n      issues where agencies and regulations already exist as an oversight.\n\n             As noted herein[,] there are guidelines as to what is appropriate and there are agencies\n\n      that can oversee same with their enforcement divisions as that of the EPA's.\n\n             In my opinion[,] I don't have a basis to impose any further guidelines. This Court\n\n      asked for a certain investigation to be done and in my opinion that investigation has been\n\n      successfully done. That investigation satisfied the basics of what this Court wanted to see\n\n\n\n                                              -39-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       from the Defendant before they [sic] started the process of demolition. I am now satisfied\n\n       by the fact that the environment protection and other agencies can continue to oversee this\n\n       project should there be violations of regulations, codes[,] or the like.\n\n               This Court has accomplished what it wanted to do when it issued the TRO and\n\n       Preliminary Injunction on a previous occasion and ordered the Defendant to do certain work\n\n       to ensure that the residents were protected from many concerns that might have existed\n\n       because of unregulated or uncontrolled activity by the City of Chicago in regards to\n\n       demolition.\n\n               It is appropriate for demolition to commence now under the standards laid out by the\n\n       expert testimony of the City of Chicago. Further delay creates inordinate safety issues\n\n       pertaining to the existence of vacant unoccupied structures as well as the resultant safety\n\n       issues within the approximate three hundred acres known as the Acquisition Area. That area\n\n       with all structures properly and safely removed eliminates the current eye sore condition and\n\n       eliminates the numerous concerns of fire, vandalism, and individual injuries to the public.\n\n               Based on the foregoing[,] there is a separate remedy with the enforcement divisions\n\n       of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require judicial\n\n       intervention.\" (Emphases in original and added.)\n\n       The trial court then made specific factual findings as to each of the prerequisites for a\n\npreliminary injunction. See Grandberg v. Didrickson, 279 Ill. App. 3d 886, 888-90 (1996) (stating\n\nprerequisites for a preliminary injunction). The court said:\n\n       \"1. Ascertainable Claim for Relief\n\n\n\n\n                                                -40-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n              Here, Plaintiffs claimed in their pleadings, in pertinent part, that they were entitled\n\n      to continuing injunctive relief because the City's planned demolition in the Acquisition Area\n\n      will endanger residents in Bensenville.\n\n              However, by the time of the July 7-10 hearing, the status quo as to residential\n\n      occupancy in the Acquisition Area had materially changed. *** [A]s the testimony\n\n      established, the number of residential occupied parcels has been reduced to only thirteen.\n\n      Moreover, as the evidence established, the planned demolition will be protective of all\n\n      remaining residents and Bensenville residents adjacent to the Acquisition Area.\n\n              Accordingly, the strength of Plaintiffs' ascertainable claims has been materially\n\n      diminished, a factor which the Court may take into account in deciding whether Plaintiffs are\n\n      entitled to continuing equitable relief.\n\n      2.Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n              ***.\n\n              A court may enjoin an anticipated nuisance only where it clearly appears that a\n\n      nuisance will necessarily result. [Citation.] ***\n\n              In this case, the Plaintiffs have not established that the City's planned demolition,\n\n      with the testing and controls to be put into place, constitutes a current, existing public\n\n      nuisance or that the public health will be endangered from demolition. Consequently,\n\n      Plaintiffs were required, but failed, to establish that there is a fair question that they have a\n\n      likelihood of success on the merits. I note this especially in light of the fact that the Plaintiffs\n\n      have not performed any independent testing or evaluative field studies of their own! They\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -41-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       have only taken issue with that performed by the Defendant. As such[,] the Plaintiff[s]\n\n       [have] not met their burden of proof for continuing injunctive relief.\n\n       3. Irreparable Harm\n\n              Plaintiffs have not established that they will be subject to irreparable harm as a result\n\n       of the demolition for much of the same reason that they have not established a fair question\n\n       of likelihood of success on the merits of their nuisance claim.\n\n              Plaintiffs have not established that they will be endangered by the City's planned\n\n       demolition. As discussed above, Plaintiffs' experts at most testified that there may be an\n\n       issue of concern or that they were uncertain or needed further data. However, these tentative\n\n       questions and concerns do not constitute actual harm. Moreover, as the evidence at the\n\n       hearing further established, not only will proper precautionary measures be taken during\n\n       demolition through the application of CRA's decommissioning and demolition controls ***\n\n       and air monitoring program *** to prevent any unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful\n\n       materials in the Acquisition Area, but Plaintiffs' claims that the Acquisition Area presents\n\n       significant uncontrollable risks to public health are simply without foundation.\n\n       4. No Adequate Remedy at Law\n\n              An additional element to be considered with regard to a decision as to whether\n\n       continuing injunctive relief should issue is whether Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at\n\nlaw.\n\n              If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that the City's demolition will endanger\n\n       public health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But, as indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                                -42-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      above, Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant the\n\n      continuing preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\n\n              A separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various federal and\n\n      state environmental protection agencies as created by the legislative bodies. There is no\n\n      further authority or basis for judicial intervention by this court.\n\n      5. Balancing the Hardships\n\n              The Court must also balance the hardships and the public interest in making its\n\n      determination regarding whether equitable injunctive relief should issue. *** Balancing the\n\n      hardships and the public interest clearly weigh in favor of terminating the preliminary\n\n      injunction. This determination is not made with an evaluation of necessity, which this Court\n\n      excluded from this hearing as that issue is currently pending in an eminent domain action\n\n      before Judge Culliton of the 18th Judicial Circuit. But the legislative history is relevant to\n\n      this determination.\n\n              The Illinois legislature has determined that the OMP is a project vital to the public\n\n      interest. ***\n\n              The evidence demonstrates that the demolition will occur in a manner protective of\n\n      public health. As previously referenced in this opinion, the prompt demolition of City-\n\n      owned buildings clearly outweighs Plaintiffs' unsubstantiated and admittedly uncertain\n\n      claims of harm concerning the planned demolition.\n\n              For all of these reasons, the balance of hardships weighs in favor of demolition in the\n\n      Acquisition Area, and the public interest amply supports proceeding with demolition as\n\n      planned by CRA on behalf of the City of Chicago.\" (Emphases in original and added.)\n\n\n\n                                               -43-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nThe court ordered that the demolition:\n\n       \"comply with all applicable state and federal environmental laws with respect to\n\n       decommissioning and demolition of the Acquisition Area buildings, and associated building\n\n       materials, equipment and contents, including but not limited to applicable provisions of the\n\n       Toxic Substances Control Act, and regulations thereunder, including 40 C.F.R. Part 761; the\n\n       Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations thereunder, including 40 C.F.R.\n\n       Part 273; the Clean Air Act NESHAP for asbestos, 40 C.F.R. Part 61, and other federal and\n\n       state regulations pertaining to asbestos in the demolition context; federal and state law\n\n       pertaining to removal of underground storage tanks; and the Occupational Safety and Health\n\n       Act and regulations issued thereunder, including 29 C.F.R. 1926, Subpart T.\"\n\nThe court further directed Chicago to complete any further testing of structures or soils that it\n\n\"determines is necessary\" before beginning demolition in those areas.\n\n       On August 8, 2008, plaintiffs moved for a stay of the order lifting the injunction, pending\n\nappeal. The court refused to grant \"an indefinite stay\" but entered a stay until September 10. On\n\nAugust 14, plaintiffs appealed, under Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (188 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1)), the\n\norder lifting the injunction. Plaintiffs also appealed under Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (210 Ill. 2d\n\nR. 304(a)) the order dismissing counts I through IV of plaintiffs' complaint.\n\n       On August 18, plaintiffs moved this court for a stay of the August 7 order lifting the\n\ninjunction. We granted the motion and stayed the order pending further order of this court.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                               I. Dismissal of Counts I through IV\n\n\n\n\n                                               -44-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        We address first plaintiffs' challenge to the dismissal of counts I through IV of their second\n\namended complaint. Counts I and IV were dismissed under section 2--619 of the Code and counts\n\nII and III under section 2--615 of the Code.\n\n                                          A. Counts I and IV\n\n        \"A motion to dismiss under section 2--619(a)(9) admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint\n\nand raises defects, defenses, or other affirmative matters that appear on the face of the complaint or\n\nare established by external submissions and that act to defeat the plaintiff's claim.\" Board of\n\nTrustees of Community College District No. 502 v. Department of Professional Regulation, 363 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 190, 196 (2006). A dismissal under section 2--619 is generally reviewed de novo. Board\n\nof Trustees, 363 Ill. App. 3d at 196.\n\n        Count I seeks a declaration that: (1) the Act does not override the requirement of the Illinois\n\nConstitution \"that the courts *** decide after an evidentiary hearing whether any particular parcel\n\nis necessary\" for a public purpose; and (2) Chicago did not provide the requisite justification for\n\n\"taking\" properties in the Acquisition Area. Count I also asks that Chicago be ordered to restore \"to\n\ntheir prior state and condition\" the properties it \"acquired\" from the Acquisition Area and that\n\nChicago be enjoined from \"further acquisitions\"of property in Bensenville \"under any claim that the\n\nproperties are necessary\" for the OMP until Chicago proves its compliance with constitutional\n\nrequirements.\n\n        Before reviewing the trial court's grounds for dismissing count I under section 2--619, we\n\ntouch briefly on that part of count I in which plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Act does not trump\n\nthe constitutional restrictions on the taking of property. The trial court did not expressly rule on this\n\nrequest, but its remarks evince agreement with plaintiffs on the Act's relationship to the Illinois\n\n\n\n                                                  -45-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nConstitution. In its recitation of the applicable law, the trial court stated: \"If property is not\n\nnecessary for the public project, there is no constitutional authority to take the property--despite what\n\nthe Legislature has asserted in the authorizing statute.\" (Emphasis added.) This is a correct\n\nstatement of the law. Article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution, the takings clause, provides:\n\n\"Private property shall not be taken *** for public use without just compensation as provided by\n\nlaw.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, §15. The takings clause \" 'is a restraint and limitation placed upon the\n\nexercise of [the condemnation power] as against the right of the private citizen except in those cases\n\nwhere public necessity requires the taking of private property for public use,' \" and \"[t]he legislature\n\n*** cannot, by delegating the power of eminent domain, dispense with constitutional requirements\n\nrestricting its use, including the requirement of 'necessity.' \" YWCA, 86 Ill. 2d at 232-33, quoting\n\nRyan, 357 Ill. at 154; see also Davis v. Brown, 357 Ill. App. 3d 176, 183 (2005) (\"the legislature\n\ncannot enact a statute that overrides or circumvents the constitution\").\n\n        Despite agreeing with plaintiffs that the Act is subservient to the Illinois Constitution, the\n\ntrial court dismissed the whole of count I. Presumably, the trial court considered the plea for a\n\ndeclaration moot upon finding other affirmative matter under section 2--619 that barred plaintiffs'\n\nclaim that Chicago did not meet the constitutional requirements for acquiring the properties in\n\nBensenville. See Sadler v. Creekmur, 354 Ill. App. 3d 1029, 1039-40 (2004) (mootness is a ground\n\nfor dismissal under section 2--619). In any event, plaintiffs complain of no error in the trial court's\n\ndisposition of their request for a declaration that the Act does not override constitutional\n\nrequirements. Rather, it seems their goal in pressing for that declaration was to clarify that, as they\n\nclaim in their brief, the Act does not prohibit them from \"proceed[ing] with adjudication of their\n\nallegations that Chicago's claims of constitutional necessity for hundreds of properties in Bensenville\n\n\n\n                                                  -46-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nare false and inaccurate.\" The trial court agreed, as do we, that the Act presents no such bar.\n\nWhether an obstacle in section 2--619 exists elsewhere is another matter.\n\n          In presenting its reasons for dismissing count I under section 2--619, the trial court\n\ndistinguished two groups of properties: (1) plaintiffs' own properties in the Acquisition Area,\n\ncurrently the subject of the eminent domain action before Judge Culliton; and (2) all other properties\n\nin the Acquisition Area. (The trial court assumed that all but plaintiffs' properties have been\n\nacquired by Chicago.) The trial court found these component claims barred by different affirmative\n\nmatter.\n\n          First, with respect to plaintiffs' own properties, the trial court determined that plaintiffs had\n\n\"an identical cause of action\" before Judge Culliton and could \"obtain complete relief\" in that\n\nproceeding. The court held, therefore, that this component of count I was barred under section\n\n2--619(a)(3) of the Code, which provides for dismissal where \"there is another action pending\n\nbetween the same parties for the same cause\" (735 ILCS 5/2--619(a)(3) (West 2006)).\n\n          \"Section 2--619(a)(3) furthers judicial economy by avoiding duplicative litigation.\"\n\nCombined Insurance Co. of America v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London, 356 Ill. App. 3d\n\n749, 753 (2005). \"With respect to whether the actions are for the same cause, the crucial inquiry is\n\nwhether both arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, not whether the legal theory, issues,\n\nburden of proof, or relief sought materially differs between the two actions.\" Jackson v. Callan\n\nPublishing, Inc., 356 Ill. App. 3d 326, 337 (2005). The \"same parties\" requirement of section\n\n2--619(a)(3) is satisfied \" 'where the litigants' interests are sufficiently similar, even though the\n\nlitigants differ in name or number.' \" Combined Insurance Co., 356 Ill. App. 3d at 754, quoting\n\nDoutt v. Ford Motor Co., 276 Ill. App. 3d 785, 788 (1995). Even when the \"same cause\" and \"same\n\n\n\n                                                    -47-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nparties\" requirements are met, section 2--619(a)(3) does not mandate automatic dismissal.\n\nCombined Insurance Co., 356 Ill. App. 3d at 754. Rather, the decision to grant or deny a section\n\n2--619(a)(3) motion is discretionary with the trial court, unlike motions under other subsections of\n\nsection 2--619 or under section 2--615. Combined Insurance Co., 356 Ill. App. 3d at 754. The\n\nreason is that \"a section 2--619(a)(3) motion *** is inherently procedural and urges the trial court\n\nto weigh several factors to determine whether it is appropriate for the action to proceed.\" Combined\n\nInsurance Co., 356 Ill. App. 3d at 753. The following factors are relevant: (1) comity; (2) the\n\nprevention of multiplicity, vexation, and harassment; (3) the likelihood of obtaining relief in the\n\nforeign jurisdiction; and (4) the res judicata effect of a foreign judgment in a local forum. In re\n\nEstate of Hoch, 382 Ill. App. 3d 866, 869 (2008). \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling\n\nis arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, or when no reasonable person would take the same view.\"\n\nFavia v. Ford Motor Co., 381 Ill. App. 3d 809, 815 (2008).\n\n         We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's application of section 2--619(a)(3) to\n\nplaintiffs' claim that Chicago has not fulfilled its constitutional burden of proving that their\n\nproperties are necessary for the OMP. First, the present proceeding and the proceeding before Judge\n\nCulliton are for the \"same cause.\" The matter before Judge Culliton is an eminent domain\n\nproceeding by which Chicago seeks to acquire plaintiffs' properties for the OMP. In that proceeding,\n\nplaintiffs contend that their properties are not necessary for either Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the OMP.\n\nPlaintiffs present the identical challenge here. The actions also involve the same parties. Plaintiffs\n\nare all parties to the suit before Judge Culliton and so their interests naturally are well represented\n\nthere.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -48-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Plaintiffs point out that \"none of the several hundred properties which Chicago has already\n\nacquired, which are the subject of this case, are involved in [Judge Culliton's case].\" (Emphasis\n\nadded.) This fact was fully grasped by the trial court, which found separate grounds (which we\n\nreview below) for granting the section 2--619 motion with respect to properties Chicago has already\n\nacquired.\n\n        Of course, as noted, the fulfillment of the \"same cause\" and \"same parties\" requirements does\n\nnot entail a reflexive dismissal but rather a look at the Hoch factors. Of the four Hoch factors, the\n\ntrial court gave special emphasis to the likelihood of relief in the Culliton proceeding. In seeking\n\nto upset the trial court's decision, plaintiffs offer surprisingly little argument on the Hoch factors.\n\nThey certainly do not convince us that the factors weigh so heavily against dismissal that the trial\n\ncourt's decision was arbitrary, fanciful, or irrational. Plaintiffs' only contention is that \"none of the\n\nequitable relief sought here is involved in [Judge Culliton's case].\" Presumably, plaintiffs mean the\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief they seek here, but they do not present any explanation or develop\n\nany argument regarding the noninvolvement of this relief in the case before Judge Culliton. We will\n\nnot make their case for them. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing,\n\nunder section 2--619(a)(3) of the Code, plaintiffs' request for a declaration that their properties are\n\nnot necessary for the OMP.\n\n        Turning to the trial court's grounds for dismissing count I as it relates to properties other than\n\nplaintiffs', we note that the trial court appeared to misconstrue count I, though not in a way fatal to\n\nits analysis. The trial court assumed that all of the property owners other than plaintiffs \"contracted\"\n\nwith Chicago \"for the sale of [their] properties.\" The source of this assumption is unclear to us.\n\nCount I alleges that Chicago acquired properties \"either through eminent domain proceedings or the\n\n\n\n                                                  -49-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthreat of eminent domain.\" (Emphases added.) Count II alleges that \"many--indeed hundreds of\n\nproperty owners--sold their homes to Chicago under threat of eminent domain in reliance on the truth\n\nof Chicago's false statements as to necessity to take their properties.\" (Emphasis added.) Yet count\n\nII also references condemnation proceedings involving some of the properties.\n\n       A distinction may possibly lie here. The complaint does not expound the phrase \"threat of\n\neminent domain,\" but, generally, a \"taking\" for constitutional purposes requires at least the formal\n\ninitiation of condemnation proceedings. See Kleinschmidt, Inc. v. County of Cook, 287 Ill. App.\n\n3d 312, 317 (1997) (\"where parties agree to compensation so as to forestall a condemnation\n\nproceeding, no taking occurs\"; thus, the takings clause was not triggered where, at the time of the\n\nsale, the government had not initiated eminent domain proceedings but had passed a resolution\n\nproviding for condemnation in the event the parties did not agree on a purchase price); Towne v.\n\nTown of Libertyville, 190 Ill. App. 3d 563, 568 (1989) (\"The taking of property in the constitutional\n\nsense is accomplished only by the filing of a petition, the ascertainment of value, and the payment\n\nof just compensation\"). For the sake of clarity, we treat count I as concerning properties acquired\n\nin eminent domain proceedings where constitutional strictures applied, and count II as concerning\n\nproperties acquired through voluntary sales where the constitution was not implicated but where\n\n\n\n\n                                                -50-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ncommon-law principles (such as fraud) of course applied.9 The lynchpin of both counts, however,\n\nis that the requisite necessity is lacking with respect to properties Chicago has acquired.\n\n       With this clarification in mind, we examine the trial court's specific grounds for dismissing\n\nthe remainder of count I. The trial court reasoned that plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the\n\ncondemnation of properties not their own. Lack of standing may be alleged in a motion pursuant to\n\nsection 2--619(a)(9) of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2--619(a)(9) (West 2006)), which provides for\n\ndismissal on the ground that \"the claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative\n\nmatter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.\" We review de novo the dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint for lack of standing. Winnebago County Citizens for Controlled Growth v. County of\n\nWinnebago, 383 Ill. App. 3d 735, 740 (2008).\n\n       In arguing that they have standing, plaintiffs cite Yusuf and Klaeren. In these cases, the\n\nplaintiffs were found to have standing to challenge the issuance of special use permits for properties\n\nadjoining or in the vicinity of theirs. The proposed development in Yusuf was a religious and\n\ncultural center that would also provide day-care services. The plaintiffs alleged that the development\n\n\"would result in additional traffic and noise at extended hours of the day and night, would have a\n\nsubstantial adverse impact upon [their] quiet enjoyment of their property, and would have an adverse\n\nimpact on the value of their property which is near the subject property.\" Yusuf, 120 Ill. App. 3d\n\n\n\n       9\n           Count II does also allege that Chicago made false statements about necessity to \"the DuPage\n\n[sic] County Circuit Court\" in condemnation proceedings involving some of the acquired properties.\n\nPlaintiffs do not, however, allege any reliance by \"the DuPage [sic] County Circuit Court\" on those\n\nstatements. Count II is reasonably construed, therefore, as concerning transactions outside of\n\ncondemnation proceedings.\n\n                                                  -51-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nat 538. The plaintiffs in Klaeren challenged the proposed construction of a retail store near their\n\nproperties, and they alleged that \"any increase in noise, traffic or light pollution created by the\n\ndevelopment would affect the use and enjoyment of [their] properties.\" Klaeren, 202 Ill. 2d at 176.\n\nIn each case, the court held that the plaintiffs alleged injuries \"distinct\" from that of the general\n\npublic and therefore could bring their claims. Klaeren, 202 Ill. 2d at 176; Yusuf, 120 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 538.\n\n          Here, the trial court held, without analysis, that plaintiffs \"alleged no such injuries\" as were\n\nclaimed in Klaeren and Yusuf. Plaintiffs disagree. They argue that they established standing by\n\nalleging the following injuries:\n\n                 \"(A) A portion of [Bensenville] has been turned into a virtual wasteland, which the\n\n          [Residents] are forced to live in or give in to the demands of Chicago;\n\n                 (B) Reduction in the value of [the Residents'] properties;\n\n                 (C) Decreased tax base in [Bensenville] causing a rise in taxes to those taxpayers\n\n          remaining in the Village; and\n\n                 (D) Lack of community on the eastern edge of [Bensenville] surrounding the property\n\n          owned by [the Residents].\"\n\nPlaintiffs argue that these injuries are analogous to those claimed in Klaeren and Yusuf.\n\n          We do not decide whether plaintiffs satisfy the general requirements of standing, because we\n\nhold that they manifestly fail to meet the specialized and stricter norms for intervention in an eminent\n\ndomain proceeding. Section 10--5--75 of the Eminent Domain Act (735 ILCS 30/10--5--75 (West\n\n2006)) provides:\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -52-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                       \"Intervening Petition. Any person not made a party may become a party by\n\n               filing an intervening petition setting forth that the petitioner is the owner or has an\n\n               interest in property that will be taken or damaged by the proposed work. The rights\n\n               of the petitioner shall thereupon be fully considered and determined.\"\n\nThis is a codification of the rule that, \"to challenge a taking, one must have a property interest\n\naffected, and one not alleging a property interest affected has no standing to challenge a taking.\"\n\nLake County Forest Preserve District v. First National Bank of Waukegan, 213 Ill. App. 3d 309, 314\n\n(1991). \"The entire purpose of the [Eminent Domain Act] is to regulate the rights and duties\n\nbetween the condemning authority and those holding property interests. It is designed to protect the\n\nlandowner from the taking of his property without just compensation.\" City of Crystal Lake v. La\n\nSalle National Bank, 121 Ill. App. 3d 346, 355 (1984). To establish standing under the Eminent\n\nDomain Act, one must allege a property interest that is directly infringed by the taking. See Lake\n\nCounty Forest Preserve, 213 Ill. App. 3d at 314 (City of Waukegan had standing to challenge\n\nproposed taking of property within its boundaries because the city owned a utility easement in the\n\nsubject property; Community Unit School District No. 60, however, could not base standing on the\n\nprospect of lost revenue because its \"interest in receiving tax revenue from the subject property is\n\ntoo remote to provide standing to appeal\"); City of Crystal Lake, 121 Ill. App. 3d at 355 (\"The only\n\ninterest which Crystal Lake can claim is that it has filed a petition seeking to condemn the same\n\nproperty previously condemned under which it seeks priority. It is doubtful that this is a property\n\nright\"); Midwest Television, Inc. v. Champaign-Urbana Communications, Inc., 37 Ill. App. 3d 926,\n\n934 (1976) (finding no standing for cable provider to challenge, as effecting a taking without just\n\ncompensation, an ordinance mandating that an easement previously granted to another public utility\n\n\n\n                                                -53-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nshould, if possible, be interpreted to grant a cable franchisee the same rights in the easement as the\n\nother public utility; to establish standing, plaintiff would have had to allege \"that it is a property\n\nowner who has granted such an easement to another utility which might be affected\"). Plaintiffs\n\nhave not alleged that Chicago's acquisition of other properties in the Acquisition Area directly\n\ninfringed any property interest of their own. They claim only consequential harm.10\n\n       As Chicago points out, plaintiffs would be no better off if they did have standing to challenge\n\nChicago's acquisition of the properties, for they are attacking prior judgments that carry preclusive\n\neffect. Section 2--619(a)(4) of the Code provides for dismissal on the ground \"[t]hat the cause of\n\naction is barred by a prior judgment.\" 735 ILCS 5/2--619(a)(4) (West 2006). In La Salle National\n\nBank v. County Board of School Trustees, 61 Ill. 2d 524 (1975), the supreme court described the\n\npreclusive effect of a condemnation judgment. In La Salle National Bank, two school boards sought\n\nto sell land they acquired in separate eminent domain proceedings but later decided not to use for\n\nthe purpose for which it was condemned, i.e., as sites for schools. The plaintiffs, banks that held the\n\nproperties as trustees at the time they were condemned, filed suit to stop the sales, alleging that they\n\nretained a reversionary interest in the properties that was triggered when the school boards decided\n\nnot to use them for school purposes. The supreme court held that the plaintiffs' claims were barred\n\nunder the doctrine of res judicata:\n\n       \"[Plaintiffs] had the opportunity to contend in the eminent domain action that the school\n\n       authorities would take less than a fee simple estate but did not do so. No appeals were taken\n\n\n\n       10\n            Bensenville may well have easements in some of the Acquisition Area properties it does\n\nnot own in fee simple, but plaintiffs do not distinguish Bensenville's standing from that of the\n\nResidents.\n\n                                                 -54-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        from those final judgments. The judgments are not now subject to collateral attack.\n\n        [Plaintiffs] cannot litigate the question they could have had decided in the original\n\n        proceedings.\" La Salle National Bank, 61 Ill. 2d at 530-31.\n\nLikewise here, plaintiffs, assuming arguendo that they possessed an interest to litigate in the\n\ncondemnation proceedings, cannot revisit the grounds for those prior judgments.\n\n        Counsel for plaintiffs intimated at oral argument that a constitutional violation may consist\n\nof the very demolition of properties for which the condemning authority has shown no necessity.\n\nCounsel's insinuation was that, if plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the acquisition of\n\nproperties other than their own, they have standing at least to seek the imposition of a constructive\n\ntrust on those properties in order to forestall what plaintiffs deem an unconstitutional demolition.\n\nAt least in count I, however, plaintiffs allege no illegality of the proposed demolition apart from the\n\nwrongful taking of the properties. As we have shown, plaintiffs either lack standing to challenge the\n\ncondemnation of properties other than their own or are barred from collaterally attacking those\n\ncondemnation judgments. For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the trial court's dismissal\n\nof count I.\n\n        Count IV, which was also dismissed under section 2--619, sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nthe Demolition Ordinance governs demolition of properties in the Acquisition Area. The trial court\n\ndismissed count IV on the ground that the Act preempts the Demolition Ordinance. \"Determination\n\nof preemption of a local ordinance by a state statute involves construction of the statute and is\n\nsubject to de novo review.\" City of Champaign v. Sides, 349 Ill. App. 3d 293, 299 (2004).\n\n        The trial court relied on section 25 of the Act, which provides: \"Airport property shall not\n\nbe subject to the laws of any unit of local government except as provided by ordinance of\n\n\n\n                                                 -55-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n[Chicago].\" 620 ILCS 65/25 (West 2006).11 The trial court noted that section 10 of the Act (620\n\nILCS 65/10 (West 2006)) defines \"airport property\" in relevant part as \"any property or an interest\n\nin property that is, or hereafter becomes, part of O'Hare International Airport.\" The trial court\n\nconcluded that \"any property acquired by the City of Chicago for the purposes of the OMP is not\n\nsubject to the Bensenville Demolition Ordinance.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs' challenge to the trial court's analysis is twofold. First, they contend that \"airport\n\nproperty\" is property legally acquired by Chicago for O'Hare, and, because this very lawsuit\n\nchallenges the legality of Chicago's acquisition of properties in Bensenville, those properties are not\n\n\"airport property.\" The issue, however, is which legal norms govern the acquisition of property. The\n\nAct does not attempt to override constitutional restrictions on Chicago's acquisition of property.\n\n(Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges fail on other grounds, as noted above.) The Act does, however,\n\nunequivocally override local restrictions on the acquisition of property pursuant to the OMP. Section\n\n30 of the Act (620 ILCS 65/30 (West 2006)) states:\n\n                 \"It is declared to be the law of this State *** that the regulation and supervision of\n\n       the City of Chicago's implementation of the [OMP] is an exclusive State function that may\n\n       not be exercised concurrently by any unit of local government.\"\n\n\"Implementation\" we take to encompass all stages of the OMP from property acquisition, to\n\ndemolition, to construction. The Demolition Ordinance, being the creature of a locality, is\n\npreempted by the Act to the extent that it attempts to regulate any stage in the implementation of the\n\nOMP.\n\n\n\n       11\n            There is no question that Chicago has not authorized regulation by any other local\n\ngovernment.\n\n                                                  -56-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Given the foregoing, we can dispense in short order with plaintiffs' second point, which is\n\nthat the Demolition Ordinance is a public safety measure akin to the police and fire protection that\n\nBensenville continues to provide in the Acquisition Area at Chicago's insistence. Plaintiffs wonder\n\n\"how Bensenville can enforce police, fire, and other public safety laws in the Acquisition Area while\n\nbeing barred from enforcing its public safety and health[-]based demolition ordinance.\" But the\n\nissue, as Chicago notes, is whether Bensenville's police and fire protection and other public safety\n\nservices \"constitute attempted regulation of the OMP.\" Plaintiffs' argument is undercut by the very\n\ncases they cite, both of which judge a county's obligation to comply with city ordinances by whether\n\nthe ordinances conflict with the statutory program carried out by the county. See Lake County Public\n\nBuilding Comm'n v. City of Waukegan, 273 Ill. App. 3d 15, 20 (1995) (county acting pursuant to\n\nPublic Building Commission Act (50 ILCS 20/1 et seq. (West 1994)) was obligated to comply with\n\ncity building ordinances designed to protect the health and safety of citizens of the city, because there\n\nwas no evidence that the act exempted the county from compliance or that the ordinances would\n\nthwart the county's operations under the act); Village of Swansea v. County of St. Clair, 45 Ill. App.\n\n3d 184, 188 (1977) (county acting pursuant to Animal Control Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1975, ch. 8, par.\n\n351 et seq.) not obligated to comply with city zoning ordinances that \"frustrate\" the aim of the act).\n\nPlaintiffs point to no way in which Bensenville's provision of fire and police services attempts to\n\nregulate the implementation of the OMP. Here lies the difference between those measures and the\n\nDemolition Ordinance, which overtly purports to restrict the demolition of properties in the\n\nAcquisition Area. We uphold the dismissal of count IV on the ground that the Demolition Ordinance\n\nis preempted by the Act.\n\n                                   II. Dismissal of Counts II and III\n\n\n\n                                                  -57-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       The trial court dismissed counts II and III pursuant to section 2--615 of the Code. The\n\nfollowing standards shape our review of dismissals under section 2--615.\n\n               \"The question presented by a section 2--615 motion to dismiss is whether the\n\n       allegations of the complaint, when viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff, are\n\n       sufficient to state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. [Citation.] Illinois is\n\n       a fact-pleading jurisdiction that requires a plaintiff to present a legally and factually sufficient\n\n       complaint. [Citation.] The plaintiff is not required to prove his or her case, but must allege\n\n       sufficient facts to state all the elements of the asserted cause of action. [Citation.]\n\n               When ruling on a section 2--615 motion to dismiss, the trial court should admit all\n\n       well-pleaded facts as true and disregard legal and factual conclusions that are unsupported\n\n       by allegations of fact. [Citation.] If, after disregarding any legal and factual conclusions, the\n\n       complaint does not allege sufficient facts to state a cause of action, the trial court must grant\n\n       the motion to dismiss. [Citation.] The standard of review on a section 2--615 motion to\n\n       dismiss is de novo.\" Neurosurgery & Spine Surgery, S.C. v. Goldman, 339 Ill. App. 3d 177,\n\n       182 (2003).\n\n       Count II alleges common-law fraud. As noted above, we construe count II as concerning\n\nalleged misrepresentations by Chicago in the course of voluntary transactions between Chicago and\n\nproperty owners other than plaintiffs. \"The elements of common-law fraud are: (1) a false statement\n\nof material fact; (2) defendant's knowledge that the statement was false; (3) defendant's intent that\n\nthe statement induce plaintiff to act; (4) plaintiff's reliance upon the truth of the statement; and (5)\n\nplaintiff's damages resulting from reliance on the statement.\" Wernikoff v. Health Care Service\n\nCorp., 376 Ill. App. 3d 228, 233 (2007). Corresponding to these elements, plaintiffs allege, in\n\n\n\n                                                  -58-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nrelevant part: (1) Chicago made false allegations \"to meet the necessity requirements of the Illinois\n\nConstitution,\" namely, that all of the properties in the Acquisition Area are needed for Phase 1 or\n\nPhase 2 of the OMP; (2) \"Chicago [knew] that its factual assertions [were] false; (3) Chicago\n\n\"intended its false factual statements as to necessity would cause many property owners to sell their\n\nhomes and businesses under threat of eminent domain\"; (4) \"hundreds of property owners *** sold\n\ntheir homes to Chicago under threat of eminent domain in reliance on the truth of Chicago's false\n\nstatements as to necessity to take their properties\"; and (5) plaintiffs have suffered \"a lack of\n\ncommunity,\" diminished property values, and higher property taxes.\n\n       The trial court dismissed count II upon finding that: (1) the alleged representations are not\n\nactionable both because they constitute legal positions rather than assertions of fact and because they\n\namount to \"[a]ssurance[s] as to future events\"; and (2) plaintiffs' damages are \"speculative at best.\"\n\n       In addition to defending these grounds, Chicago argues that count II fails because plaintiffs\n\nseek to recover based on statements made to and relied on by third parties (i.e., other property\n\nowners), not plaintiffs themselves. Chicago made this argument below but the trial court did not\n\ncomment on it. We, however, may consider it as a basis for affirmance. Paul H. Schwendener, Inc.\n\nv. Jupiter Electric Co., 358 Ill. App. 3d 65, 71 (2005) (dismissal under section 2--615 may be\n\naffirmed on any basis in the record).\n\n       We rely on principles laid out in Shannon v. Boise Cascade Corp., 208 Ill. 2d 517 (2004).\n\nThe plaintiffs in Shannon brought a claim under the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business\n\nPractices Act (Consumer Fraud Act) (815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. (West 1998)) against Boise Cascade,\n\nthe manufacturer of siding that was installed on the plaintiffs' homes when they were built. The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the siding deteriorated prematurely and that Boise Cascade made false\n\n\n\n                                                 -59-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nrepresentations about the durability of the siding in its product literature. The supreme court\n\naffirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for Boise Cascade. The court held that\n\n\"deceptive advertising cannot be the proximate cause of damages under the [Consumer Fraud] Act\n\nunless it actually deceives the plaintiff\" and that the plaintiffs' complaint was deficient for failing to\n\nallege such \"actual deception.\" Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 525. The court caveated that the deception\n\nneed not \"always be direct between the defendant and the plaintiff\" to satisfy the Consumer Fraud\n\nAct. Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 526. That is, the complaint would have been sufficient if the plaintiffs\n\nhad alleged that the literature for the siding deceived a builder, architect, or contractor resulting in\n\ninstallation of the siding on the plaintiffs' homes. \"In those circumstances, the purchaser, who may\n\nhave no independent knowledge of the qualities or expected performance standards of siding, is\n\ndeceived because of the deception of the builder, architect or contractor, who reasonably should have\n\nhad correct knowledge.\" Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 526. The plaintiffs, however, did not \"allege that\n\nany deceptive advertising by [Boise Cascade] was received by any plaintiff, or that it was received\n\nby any builder, architect, engineer, or other like person somehow connected with a plaintiff.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.) Boise Cascade, 208 Ill. 2d at 525. The plaintiffs' fraud claim thus failed. Boise\n\nCascade, 208 Ill. 2d at 526.\n\n        As support for its reasoning, the supreme court cited St. Joseph Hospital v. Corbetta\n\nConstruction Co., 21 Ill. App. 3d 925 (1974), where a hospital brought a common-law fraud claim\n\nagainst the manufacturer of wall paneling installed in the hospital. The hospital put forth evidence\n\nat trial that the manufacturer failed to disclose to the architect and the builder that product testing\n\nhad revealed the paneling to have a flame spread in excess of that allowed by the Chicago building\n\ncode. The appellate court upheld a jury verdict in favor of the hospital. St. Joseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d\n\n\n\n                                                  -60-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nat 957. The court held that there was sufficient evidence of reliance because the hospital could be\n\nsaid to have been deceived through the manufacturer's deception of the architect and the builder. St.\n\nJoseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d at 956. The court explained that privity \"in the traditional sense\" does not\n\napply in fraud cases. St. Joseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d at 954. \"It is enough,\" the court explained, \"that the\n\nstatements by the defendant be made with the intention that it reach the plaintiff and influence his\n\naction and that it does reach him and that he does rely upon it, to his damage.\" St. Joseph, 21 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 954. The court cited legal commentary for support. See St. Joseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d at 955\n\n(\" 'While some connection, direct or indirect, between a party charged with making false\n\nrepresentations and a party relying thereon must be shown, it is not essential, in support of a cause\n\nof action for damages resulting from false representations, that the false representations be shown\n\nto have been made directly to the party claiming to have relied upon them' \"), quoting 37 Am. Jur.\n\n2d Fraud & Deceit §190, at 252-53 (1968).\n\n       The suit in Boise Cascade was brought under the Consumer Fraud Act, but the supreme court\n\ncited with unqualified approval St. Joseph's requirement of actual deception in common-law fraud\n\ncases as well. Count II fails this requirement of actual deception. The claimed misrepresentations\n\nwere made to third parties--other property owners--and there is no allegation that these\n\nmisrepresentations flowed to plaintiffs and influenced their actions. Plaintiffs allege no reliance of\n\ntheir own and so fail to plead common-law fraud under Illinois law. See Premier Electrical\n\nConstruction Co. v. Morse/Diesel, Inc., 257 Ill. App. 3d 445, 458 (1993) (\"a common law fraud\n\nclaim requires actual reliance, which means that the misrepresentations must reach the plaintiff, who\n\nmust reasonably rely on them\").\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -61-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Plaintiffs are correct that Board of Education of the City of Chicago v. A, C & S, Inc., 131\n\nIll. 2d 428 (1989), allows a plaintiff to recover for damages caused strictly by a third party's reliance\n\non a defendant's misrepresentations, but plaintiffs overstate the scope of this liability. The plaintiffs\n\nin A, C & S sued manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos and alleged that the defendants made\n\nnegligent misrepresentations about that product. The defendants argued that the trial court's\n\ndismissal of the negligent misrepresentation claim was proper under Moorman Manufacturing Co.\n\nv. National Tank Co., 91 Ill. 2d 69, 88-89 (1982), which held that \"economic loss is recoverable\n\nwhere one intentionally makes false representations [citation], and where one who is in the business\n\nof supplying information for the guidance of others in their business transactions makes negligent\n\nrepresentations.\" The defendants noted that the plaintiffs made no allegation that the defendants\n\nwere in the business of supplying information for the guidance of others in their business\n\ntransactions. The supreme court held that it need not resolve \"the question of when and against\n\nwhom a plaintiff may recover economic losses for negligent misrepresentation\" (emphasis added)\n\nbecause the plaintiffs alleged not just economic loss but physical harm as well. A, C & S, 131 Ill.\n\n2d at 454. The court found a more apt standard in section 311 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,\n\nentitled \"Negligent Misrepresentation Involving Risk of Physical Harm.\" Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts §311 (1965). Section 311 declares:\n\n                \"(1) One who negligently gives false information to another is subject to liability for\n\n        physical harm caused by action taken by the other in reasonable reliance upon such\n\n        information, where such harm results\n\n                        (a) to the other, or\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -62-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                          (b) to such third persons as the actor should expect to be put in peril by the\n\n                   action taken.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts §311, at 106 (1965).\n\nThe court observed that section 311 creates \"broader liability\" than section 552 of the Restatement,\n\nentitled \"Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others,\" which requires, in part, that\n\nthe defendant make the representations \"in the course of his business.\" Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts §552, at 126 (1965).12\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that, in adopting section 311, the supreme court in A, C & S implicitly\n\nadopted its companion provision, section 310, which is entitled \"Conscious Misrepresentation\n\nInvolving Risk of Physical Harm\" and concerns fraudulent rather than negligent misrepresentations.\n\nSection 310 provides:\n\n                   \"An actor who makes a misrepresentation is subject to liability to another for physical\n\n        harm which results from an act done by the other or a third person in reliance upon the truth\n\n        of the representation, if the actor\n\n\n\n        12\n             Section 311 is broader also because, as we explain below, it permits recovery for parties\n\nwho did not themselves rely on the alleged misrepresentations but were damaged by those who did.\n\nThe supreme court in A, C & S did not, however, apply this feature of section 311. In remanding\n\nthe case, the court noted that the plaintiffs' allegations were \"very broad and unspecific\" and that they\n\nwould need to prove at trial \"what representations were made to them and who made [the]\n\nrepresentations.\" (Emphasis added.) A, C & S, 131 Ill. 2d at 456. Apparently, the plaintiffs alleged\n\ntheir own reliance, not that of others. Thus, the court relied on section 311 not for its expansive\n\nconcept of reliance but for its lack of a requirement that the defendant have made the\n\nmisrepresentation in the course of its business.\n\n                                                    -63-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                        (a) intends his statement to induce or should realize that it is likely to induce\n\n                action by the other, or a third person, which involves an unreasonable risk of physical\n\n                harm to the other, and\n\n                        (b) knows\n\n                                (I) that the statement is false, or\n\n                                (ii) that he has not the knowledge he professes.\" Restatement\n\n                        (Second) of Torts §310, at 103 (1965).\n\nSection 310 imposes liability on the defendant for physical harm to another \"which results from an\n\nact done by the other or a third person in reliance\" upon a conscious misrepresentation made by the\n\ndefendant. (Emphasis added.) Restatement (Second) of Torts §310, at 103 (1965). Likewise,\n\nsection 311 imposes liability where the defendant makes a negligent misrepresentation to another\n\nand the other's reliance causes physical harm to \"third persons.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n§311, at 106 (1965). Thus, sections 310 and 311 both permit recovery for parties who did not\n\nthemselves rely on the alleged misrepresentation but were damaged by those who did so rely.\n\nNeither section is applicable here, however, because each presupposes physical harm and plaintiffs\n\nhave not alleged that they incurred such harm.\n\n        Because plaintiffs have not alleged that they themselves relied on the misrepresentations for\n\nwhich they seek recovery, and because they do not claim physical harm, they have not adequately\n\npleaded the element of reliance. The trial court, therefore, did not err in dismissing count II. In light\n\nof this holding, we do not review Chicago's other proposed bases for affirming the dismissal.\n\n        Count III of plaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat \"Chicago has improperly and unjustly obtained and continue[s] to retain the use of the properties\n\n\n\n                                                  -64-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nin the Acquisition Area by violating the necessity limits of the Illinois Constitution and by false\n\nstatements as to necessity.\" The trial court dismissed count III because: (1) the properties \"are not\n\nfor the benefit of the City of Chicago,\" that is, there is no indication that Chicago \"intends to use the\n\nacquired properties for anything other than expansion of O'Hare\"; and (2) Chicago acquired the\n\nproperties through real estate contracts, and, therefore, unjust enrichment, a quasi-contractual\n\nremedy, is not available.\n\n        Chicago reiterates here an argument that it presented below but that drew no comment from\n\nthe trial court. Nonetheless, the argument may serve as a basis for affirmance. See Paul H.\n\nSchwendener, Inc., 358 Ill. App. 3d at 71. Chicago notes that count III deals strictly with Chicago's\n\nacquisition of properties other than plaintiffs'. Count III is deficient, Chicago suggests, because it\n\ndoes not allege that Chicago accepted any benefit from plaintiffs. This does not quite identify the\n\ntrue problem with count III. It is not itself fatal to count III that plaintiffs are complaining about what\n\nChicago acquired from others. \"To state a cause of action based on a theory of unjust enrichment,\n\na plaintiff must allege that the defendant has unjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiff's detriment,\n\nand that defendant's retention of the benefit violates the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and\n\ngood conscience.\" HPI Health Care Services, Inc. v. Mt. Vernon Hospital, Inc., 131 Ill. 2d 145, 160\n\n(1989). The doctrine of unjust enrichment permits \"recovery of a benefit that was transferred to the\n\ndefendant by a third party.\" (Emphasis added.) HPI Health Care Services, 131 Ill. 2d at 161. The\n\ndefendant's retention of a benefit transferred to it by a third party would be unjust where: \"(1) the\n\nbenefit should have been given to the plaintiff, but the third party mistakenly gave it to the defendant\n\ninstead [citation], (2) the defendant procured the benefit from the third party through some type of\n\nwrongful conduct [citation], or (3) the plaintiff for some other reason had a better claim to the benefit\n\n\n\n                                                   -65-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthan the defendant [citation].\" HPI Health Care Services, 131 Ill. 2d at 161-62. From these\n\npropositions it is apparent that the real flaw in plaintiffs' claim is their failure to allege how Chicago's\n\nacquisition of the properties from the other owners deprived plaintiffs of any \"benefit.\" Plaintiffs\n\nclaim damages flowing from Chicago's acquisition of the properties, but the basis of their complaint\n\nis not that the properties should have been conveyed to them instead. Plaintiffs assert no legal or\n\nequitable interest in the properties themselves, and therefore we cannot discern what \"benefit\"\n\nplaintiffs claim was wrongfully intercepted by Chicago when it acquired the properties. Cf. Harper\n\nv. Adametz, 142 Conn. 218, 225, 113 A.2d 136, 139 (1955) (real estate agent unjustly enriched when\n\nhe suppressed his client's purchase offer and acquired the property for himself). As plaintiffs have\n\nnot alleged that Chicago is retaining a \"benefit\" to their detriment, we hold that the trial court\n\nproperly dismissed count III of plaintiffs' second amended complaint.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of counts I through IV of\n\nplaintiffs' second amended complaint.\n\n                                 II. The Preliminary Injunction Hearing\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in dissolving its preliminary injunction against\n\ndemolition of properties in the Acquisition Area. To obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant\n\nmust establish:\n\n                  \"(1) that he or she possesses a clearly ascertainable right which needs protection; (2)\n\n        that he or she would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction; (3) there is no adequate\n\n        remedy at law for his [or her] injury; (4) there is a likelihood of success on the merits; and\n\n        (5) the plaintiff will suffer more harm without the injunction than the defendant will suffer\n\n        with it. ***\n\n\n\n                                                   -66-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                                                  ***\n\n                  *** In balancing these equities, the court should also consider the effect of the\n\n        injunction on the public.\" Grandberg, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 888-90.\n\n\"The decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt and on review the decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\" Klaeren, 202\n\nIll. 2d at 177.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that the trial court abused its discretion by \"abdicat[ing] *** its common law\n\npublic nuisance jurisdiction in favor of non-existent administrative agency protection.\" Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the trial court erroneously assumed that \"the judiciary either did not have independent\n\nnuisance jurisdiction, or that the trial court should somehow defer to the administrative agencies.\"\n\nPlaintiffs claim that these misapprehensions are evident in several of the trial court's remarks. For\n\nexample, in the prefatory findings in its written order, the trial court led with this statement:\n\n        \"I now see that there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can oversee\n\n        this demolition project. In my opinion any further oversight by the Court would be done\n\n        without proper authority.\"\n\nThe trial court determined that the \"enforcement division[s]\" of these \"agencies\" are adequate to\n\nredress \"violations of regulations, codes[,] or the like.\" The trial court found it \"appropriate for\n\ndemolition to commence now under the standards laid out by the expert testimony of the City of\n\nChicago\" and that the court \"[did not] have a basis to impose any further guidelines.\" The trial court\n\nconcluded its general findings by stating that \"there is a separate remedy with the enforcement\n\ndivisions of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require judicial\n\nintervention.\"\n\n\n\n                                                  -67-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       As plaintiffs note, these thoughts surfaced again in the trial court's specific findings. In\n\nconsidering whether plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law, the court determined:\n\n               \"If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that [Chicago's] demolition will\n\n       endanger the public health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But,\n\n       as indicated above, Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant\n\n       the continuing preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\n\n               A separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various federal and\n\n       state environmental protection agencies as created by legislative bodies. There is no further\n\n       authority or basis for judicial intervention by this court.\"\n\n       We agree with plaintiffs that the trial court's remarks are questionable on several levels.\n\nFirst, they are not consistent. At one point, the court claims that these \"agencies\" (unnamed but for\n\nthe \"EPA\") can \"oversee\" the demolition, which suggests active supervision. At another point, the\n\ncourt remarks that the agencies are available for redressing violations of regulations and codes,\n\nwhich implies not ongoing or active oversight but rather intervention as needed. Second, there is\n\nscant evidentiary ground for finding any administrative agency available to oversee the demolition\n\nin a manner active and thorough enough to prevent a public nuisance and so to serve as an adequate\n\nalternative to the equitable relief sought by plaintiffs, namely, a prospective injunction. The\n\ntestimony at the July 2008 hearing contains but two allusions to potential agency involvement. The\n\nfirst is the October 31, 1997, \"No Further Remediation\" in which the IEPA implies that further soil\n\ndisturbance at the Nelson Wire/Pro Logis site will lead to action by the IEPA, and the second is\n\nBlickle's testimony that the USEPA and IEPA both must be informed of the presence of RACM in\n\n\n\n\n                                                -68-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthe Acquisition Area. These two points of evidence do not establish potential agency involvement\n\nnearly on the scale the court conceived.\n\n       Following oral argument, Chicago filed a motion to cite statutes and regulations that vest the\n\nIEPA and the USEPA with power to enforce environmental laws and regulations. Chicago notes,\n\nfor instance, that the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Environmental Protection Act) (415\n\nILCS 5/31(d)(1) (West 2006)) provides that \"[a]ny person may file with the [Illinois Pollution\n\nControl] Board a complaint *** against any person allegedly violating this Act, any rule or\n\nregulation adopted under [this] Act, any permit or term or condition of a permit, or any Board order.\"\n\nThe Environmental Protection Act also permits the State to file enforcement actions in the circuit\n\ncourts. See generally 415 ILCS 5/42, 43, 44 (West 2006). We grant this motion, but note that these\n\nvarious authorities do not persuade us that the trial court acted correctly. Agency authority does not\n\ndisplace the judiciary's equitable powers in these circumstances.\n\n       Such is the lesson of Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 77 Ill. App. 3d 618 (1979),\n\nwhere a municipality and a county sued to enjoin the operation of a newly operational landfill for\n\nhazardous waste. The plaintiffs argued that the landfill was a public nuisance because there was a\n\nrisk that toxic or flammable substances would seep from the landfill. The IEPA had issued the\n\ndefendant an initial permit to operate the landfill, and afterward the defendant applied for and\n\nreceived from the IEPA a permit for each waste the defendant proposed to deposit at the landfill.\n\nThe trial court entered a permanent injunction against continued operation of the landfill.\n\nWilsonville, 77 Ill. App. 3d at 621-23.\n\n       The defendant appealed, and the court permitted the USEPA to file an amicus curiae brief\n\nin which it defended the public need for the landfill. The defendant argued to the court \"that the trial\n\n\n\n                                                 -69-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ncourt either lacked jurisdiction to hear the case or, in the alternative, should have deferred to the\n\nconcurrent jurisdiction of the administrative agencies, IEPA and the Pollution Control Board.\"\n\nWilsonville, 77 Ill. App. 3d at 623. The court rejected both positions while acknowledging \"the lack\n\nof expertise in courts to fully understand the complicated technical matters involved in a case of this\n\nnature.\" Wilsonville, 77 Ill. App. 3d at 625. The court found that Illinois law \"clearly indicate[s]\n\na policy *** not to leave the enforcement of environmental matters exclusively in the hands of\n\nadministrative agencies but to have a dual system of enforcement and civil relief.\" Wilsonville, 77\n\nIll. App. 3d at 625; see also People ex rel. Scott v. Janson, 57 Ill. 2d 451, 460 (1974) (\"there exists\n\njurisdiction [in the courts] to abate public nuisances which may endanger the general welfare\").\n\n       Proceeding to the merits of the case, the appellate court upheld the permanent injunction.\n\nThe defendant acknowledged that \"severe damage [was] likely to result if substantial amounts of\n\nhazardous substances escaped from the landfill,\" but argued that the possibility of a release was \"too\n\nuncertain and, in any event, too far in the distant future to form the basis for the issuance of an\n\ninjunction.\" Wilsonville, 77 Ill. App. 3d at 633. The court disagreed, holding that the \"extremely\n\nserious,\" indeed \"catastrophic,\" nature of the possible harm outweighed the consideration of\n\nlikelihood. Wilsonville, 77 Ill. App. 3d at 635, 638.\n\n       On appeal to the supreme court, the defendant argued for deference to the IEPA, which had\n\nlicensed the landfill, and to the USEPA, which had filed the amicus brief explaining the public need\n\nfor the landfill. The court declined to defer:\n\n               \"The defendant *** asserts that error occurred in the courts below when they failed\n\n       to defer to the IEPA and the USEPA, as well as when they failed to give weight to the\n\n       permits issued by the IEPA. This assertion has no merit, however, because the data relied\n\n\n\n                                                 -70-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        upon by the IEPA in deciding to issue a permit to the defendant were data collected by the\n\n        defendant, data which have been proved at trial to be inaccurate. In particular, defendant's\n\n        experts concluded that any subsidence at the site would be negligible. The IEPA (as well as\n\n        the USEPA) adopted this inaccurate conclusion in deciding to issue a permit to the\n\n        defendant.\" Village of Wilsonville v. SCA Services, Inc., 86 Ill. 2d 1, 27 (1981).\n\n        Reaching the merits, the supreme court upheld the permanent injunction. The court agreed\n\nwith the trial and appellate courts that \"a prospective nuisance is a fit candidate for injunctive relief.\"\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 25. The court held that \"the defendant is engaged\n\nin an extremely hazardous undertaking at an unsuitable location, which seriously and imminently\n\nposes a threat to the public health.\" Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 30. The court rejected the defendant's\n\ncontention that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law because they could have pursued relief\n\nthrough administrative channels:\n\n                \"We *** disagree with the defendant that since the plaintiffs could seek review from\n\n        the IEPA's decision to grant permits to the defendants through the Pollution Control Board\n\n        they have an adequate remedy at law and are unable to obtain relief in a court of equity.\n\n        First, the plaintiffs are not seeking a review of the issuance of permits. The plaintiffs [are\n\n        seeking] to enjoin a nuisance, a matter which is properly brought in a court of equity. This\n\n        court has stated that jurisdiction exists in the circuit court 'to abate public nuisances which\n\n        may endanger the general welfare.' [Citation.] Thus, the trial court has subject matter\n\n        jurisdiction to decide the issues raised herein, and to award appropriate equitable relief.\"\n\n        Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 27-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -71-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       From Wilsonville we see the error in the trial court's reasoning behind its termination of the\n\npreliminary injunction. Like Wilsonville, this case is an \"environmental matter[]\" (Wilsonville, 77\n\nIll. App. 3d at 625) in which a proposed activity is claimed to threaten a public nuisance in the form\n\nof release of hazardous substances into residential areas. Jurisdiction is no less certain here than in\n\nWilsonville. Having jurisdiction, the trial court had a responsibility to determine, under all relevant\n\nfactors, and without regard to the concurrent jurisdiction of administrative agencies, whether\n\ndemolition would constitute a public nuisance. The court, however, displayed an overt reliance on\n\nthe powers of administrative agencies in determining whether plaintiffs have an adequate remedy\n\nat law. The court found that \"a separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various\n\nfederal and state environmental protection agencies as created by the legislative bodies.\" This\n\nreliance was misplaced for two reasons. First, it was wrong from an evidentiary point of view\n\nbecause, as noted, the record contains virtually no evidence of any potential agency involvement.\n\nSee Liebert Corp. v. Mazur, 357 Ill. App. 3d 265, 276 (2005) (a trial court abuses its discretion when\n\nit relies on a factual finding that is against the manifest weight of the evidence, i.e., where the\n\nopposite conclusion is clearly evident). Second, it was wrong from an institutional view--that is, as\n\na matter of law--because, as Wilsonville teaches, the court had no cause to abdicate its judicial\n\nfunction even if a remedy could be found in administrative bodies. See Engel v. Loyfman, 383 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 191, 197 (2008) (a trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on a\n\n\"misapprehension of law\"). In Wilsonville, the supreme court rejected the defendant's argument that\n\nthe plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law because they could have pursued administrative review\n\nof the IEPA's decision to license the defendant's landfill. The supreme court reasoned that the\n\nplaintiffs were seeking \"to enjoin a nuisance, a matter which is properly brought in a court of equity.\"\n\n\n\n                                                 -72-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nWilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 27. In Wilsonville, there at least was an identifiable remedy available\n\nthrough administrative channels. Here, by contrast, there was no evidence of any available remedy,\n\nmuch less one comparable to the injunction sought. The trial court, we conclude, abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law.\n\n        We recognize, of course, that the trial court's discussion of the \"adequate remedy at law\"\n\nfactor appears at first blush to have alternative rationales. Immediately preceding the reference to\n\nadministrative agencies, the court stated:\n\n        \"If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that the City's demolition will endanger public\n\n        health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But, as indicated above,\n\n        Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant the continuing\n\n        preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\"\n\nIn actuality, this was not a finding that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law but rather an\n\nexplanation for not reaching the issue in light of the court's findings on other factors. In that respect,\n\nit does not jibe with the court's immediately following remark about the availability of remedies from\n\nadministrative agencies.\n\n        We also recognize that plaintiffs were obligated to satisfy all prerequisites for a preliminary\n\ninjunction. In theory, then, our disagreement with the trial court's finding that plaintiffs have an\n\nadequate remedy at law would pose no barrier to affirmance should we determine that plaintiffs\n\nfailed to meet one or more of the other prerequisites. We decline to take that avenue, since it is clear\n\nthat the trial court's entire analysis was influenced by its factually unfounded and legally erroneous\n\nview of the potential role of administrative agencies in the demolition. Although the trial court's\n\nerroneous perspective does not overtly surface in its discussion of the remaining findings, the general\n\n\n\n                                                  -73-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ndiscussion that precedes its specific findings is pervaded with a sentiment that the court had no place\n\nadjudicating matters on which administrative agencies may act. No fewer than five times does the\n\ncourt mention \"administrative agencies\" and their \"enforcement divisions.\" In fact, the court's\n\ndiscussion is bookended by two of these references. At the outset of its remarks, before even hinting\n\nat its own assessment of the alleged hazards in the proposed demolition, the court mentions that\n\n\"there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can oversee this demolition project\"\n\nand that \"further oversight by the Court would be done without proper authority.\" The court\n\nconcludes its remarks by stating: \"Based on the foregoing[,] there is a separate remedy with the\n\nenforcement divisions of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require\n\njudicial intervention.\" This is revealing, for, though the availability of another remedy is but one of\n\nmultiple considerations in weighing the propriety of injunctive relief, the court gives it exclusive\n\nattention here. Tellingly, the court's discussion ends not with an assertion of its own jurisdiction but\n\nwith an attitude of deference.\n\n       A further sign that the trial court's entire analysis was influenced by its notion of agency\n\ninvolvement is its failure to resolve the core conflicts in the testimony at the hearing. We have\n\nexhaustively set forth the evidence and find it teeming with polarized expert opinions on highly\n\ntechnical matters such as soil sampling, soil screening levels, emission factors, and demolition\n\ncontrols. The trial court made some reference to this testimony but its analysis shows no weighting\n\nof these radically opposed views. There is instead this summary finding:\n\n       \"[N]ot only will proper precautionary measures be taken during demolition through the\n\n       application of CRA's decommissioning and demolition controls *** and air monitoring\n\n       program *** to prevent any unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful materials in the\n\n\n\n                                                 -74-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Acquisition Area, but Plaintiffs' claims that the Acquisition Area presents significant\n\n       uncontrollable risks to public health are simply without foundation.\"\n\nSection 11--101 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/11–101 (West 2006)) provides that every order granting\n\nor denying an injunction \"shall set forth the reasons for its entry.\" Section 11--101 requires reasons\n\nclear and detailed enough to apprize the reviewing court of the basis for the decision. See In re\n\nMarriage of Grauer, 133 Ill. App. 3d 1019, 1026 (1985).13 The trial court's reasoning does not\n\ncontain specific enough findings based on proper considerations to allay our concern that the court\n\ndiminished its judicial function by impermissibly deferring to what it perceived as the capability of\n\nadministrative bodies to police the demolition. \"A court commits error when it fails to exercise its\n\ndiscretion due to a belief that it has no discretion to exercise.\" RTS Plumbing Co. v. DeFazio, 180\n\nIll. App. 3d 1037, 1041 (1989). We therefore reverse the trial court's order terminating the\n\n\n\n       13\n            At oral argument, Chicago claimed that the trial court's findings of fact are \"extensive\" and\n\nthat the court's reference to the authority of administrative agencies over the demolition was not the\n\n\"basis\" of its decision but rather a \"prefatory\" or \"background\" observation. Chicago was then asked\n\nwhere in its appellee's brief it argued that the trial court properly resolved the conflicting testimony\n\nat the injunction hearing. Counsel at the podium was given the opportunity to confer with co-\n\ncounsel on the question. Chicago mentioned the possibility of also submitting a written response.\n\nAfter counsel's conference, Chicago was unable to identify where in its brief it defended the formal\n\nsufficiency of the trial court's findings. Moreover, Chicago has since filed only a motion to cite\n\nvarious statutes and regulations, which motion we addressed above. Consequently, Chicago has\n\neffectively abandoned any effort to defend the trial court's findings as formally sufficient under\n\nsection 11--101.\n\n                                                   -75-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\npreliminary injunction and remand this case for the court to reanalyze the propriety of injunctive\n\nrelief in light of our finding that the record before the court was essentially devoid of evidence of\n\nremedies available from administrative agencies and, more importantly, our holding, pursuant to\n\nWilsonville, that any such remedies cannot replace judicial remedies in cases of this nature.\n\n       Last, we dispose of plaintiffs' \"motion to cite additional authority.\" Plaintiffs seek to apprize\n\nus that (1) the USEPA has heightened its standards for airborne lead emissions, and (2) certain\n\nairlines operating out of O'Hare have voiced opposition to Phase 2 of the OMP. These matters are\n\nmore in the nature of additional evidence than additional authority. We deny the motion without\n\nprejudice to plaintiffs seeking to raise these matters before the trial court on remand.\n\n                                           III. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing counts I through\n\nIV of plaintiffs' second amended complaint. We reverse, however, the judgment terminating the\n\npreliminary injunction that was entered in July 2007, and we remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n       Affirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded with directions.\n\n       ZENOFF, P.J., and GROMETER, J., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -76-\n\f",

We affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       The following facts set the backdrop of this matter. We will provide additional facts as\n\nneeded in our discussion of the issues.\n\n       In 2001, Chicago, as owner and operator of O'Hare, proposed the O'Hare Modernization\n\nProgram (OMP), which would reconfigure and expand O'Hare's facilities, with the purpose of\n\nstreamlining air traffic and reducing flight delays. The primary measure in the OMP is the\n\ninstallation of parallel runways to replace O'Hare's existing body of intersecting runways, to which\n\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has attributed much of O'Hare's inefficiency. The OMP\n\noutlines a two-phased \"Master Plan\" for expansion. Phase 1 calls for the expansion of an existing\n\nrunway, the reconfiguration of taxiways and a concourse, and the construction of two new runways,\n\na new western satellite terminal, and an underground automated transit system or \"people mover\"\n\nconnecting the new satellite terminal with the main terminal.1 Phase 2 envisions the expansion of\n\nanother existing runway and the construction of two additional new runways as well as a \"world\n\ngateway terminal.\"\n\n       In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly enacted the O'Hare Modernization Act (Act) (620\n\nILCS 65/1 et seq. (West 2006)). In its prefatory findings, the legislature determined that \"O'Hare\n\ncannot efficiently perform its role in the State and national air transportation systems unless it is\n\nreconfigured with multiple parallel runways.\" 620 ILCS 65/5(a)(2) (West 2006). The legislature\n\nfound it \"essential\" that the OMP \"be completed efficiently and without unnecessary delay\" and that\n\n\"acquisition of property as required for the [OMP] be completed as expeditiously as practicable.\"\n\n620 ILCS 65/5(a)(6), (a)(7) (West 2006). To carry out Chicago's expansion efforts, it is empowered\n\n\n\n       1\n           An FAA document in the record states that construction of the western terminal is projected\n\nto be \"initiated\" during Phase l but is \"independent of other Phase 1 components.\"\n\n                                                  -2-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nby the Act to \"acquire by gift, grant, lease, purchase, [or] condemnation ***, or otherwise any right,\n\ntitle, or interest in any private property,\" including property outside Chicago's boundaries. 620 ILCS\n\n65/15 (West 2006). The Act allows acquisition of property \"that [Chicago] reasonably determines\n\nwill be necessary for future use, regardless of whether final regulatory or funding decisions have\n\nbeen made.\" (Emphasis added.) 620 ILCS 65/15 (West 2006). The Act also contains a broad\n\npreemption clause providing: \"Airport property shall not be subject to the laws of any unit of local\n\ngovernment except as provided by ordinance of [Chicago].\" 620 ILCS 65/25 (West 2006).\n\n       The OMP identifies 615 parcels in Bensenville that Chicago believes it must acquire in order\n\nto complete the expansion project at O'Hare. These parcels, situated off the southwest corner of\n\nO'Hare, are collectively identified by the OMP as the \"Southwest Acquisition Area\" (Acquisition\n\nArea). The properties in the Acquisition Area are variously improved with residential, commercial,\n\nand industrial structures. Plaintiffs all own properties in the Acquisition Area. Chicago has initiated\n\neminent domain proceedings against those properties. This suit, City of Chicago v. Forest Preserve\n\nDistrict of Du Page County, No. 06--ED--111, is pending before Judge Stephen J. Culliton in the\n\ncircuit court of Du Page County.2 As for the remaining properties in the Acquisition Area, it appears\n\nthat Chicago has acquired the great majority of them, though precisely how many is unclear. It also\n\nappears that some were acquired through eminent domain proceedings and some through voluntary\n\nsales, but again the respective numbers are not clear from the record.\n\n\n\n       2\n           The record does not clearly show whether all of the Residents have properties involved in\n\nthe Culliton proceeding or, moreover, whether any properties owned by Bensenville itself are\n\ninvolved. The parties appear to assume that the Residents and Bensenville all have properties at\n\nstake in the Culliton proceeding, and we proceed on that assumption.\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In 2006 and 2007, Chicago drafted plans for demolishing structures it acquired or planned\n\nto acquire in the Acquisition Area. Chicago also developed a \"Demolition Health and Safety Plan,\"\n\nwhich described Chicago's measures for insuring that the demolition would proceed without risk to\n\npublic safety.\n\n       On June 28, 2007, plaintiffs initiated the present action by filing a two-count complaint\n\nagainst Chicago. Count I sought a declaratory judgment that Chicago's demolition plans must\n\ncomply with Bensenville's recently enacted Demolition Ordinance, which provides detailed permit\n\nrequirements for all demolition within the Bensenville village limits. Bensenville Village Code\n\n§9--6a--2(F) (eff. February 27, 2008). The Demolition Ordinance provides that any application for\n\na demolition permit must include plans for replacing the structures planned for demolition.\n\nBensenville Village Code §9--6a--2(B) (eff. February 27, 2008). The Demolition Ordinance contains\n\na specific exception for Chicago's demolition of structures in the Acquisition Area, provided Chicago\n\ndemonstrates that the demolition is \"necessary\" to accomplish the OMP. Bensenville Village Code\n\n§9--6a--2(C)(2) (eff. February 27, 2008).\n\n       Count II of plaintiffs' complaint alleged that demolition under the plans proposed by Chicago\n\nwould constitute a public nuisance, as it would \"expose *** Bensenville residents and their families\n\nto toxic or hazardous substances and chemicals released by the demolition.\"\n\n       Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for an injunction barring Chicago from demolishing any\n\nproperties in the Acquisition Area during the pendency of the lawsuit. Plaintiffs alleged that Chicago\n\nplanned to demolish the properties without having quantified all potentially harmful substances in\n\nthe structures and soils of the properties or designed appropriate measures to control the release of\n\nsuch substances into the air or ground water during demolition. Plaintiffs attached to their motion\n\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nsworn declarations from Kenneth Mundt and Mark Travers, both employees of Environ, a firm\n\nretained by Bensenville to assess the health risks posed by demolition of structures in the Acquisition\n\nArea.\n\n        Mundt, an epidemiologist, averred in his declaration that the demolition as planned by\n\nChicago would \"create[] a significant potential endangerment to the health and safety of Bensenville\n\nresidents and their families.\" Mundt stated that he had reviewed Chicago's plan for controlling\n\nemissions of harmful substances during demolition and found it inadequate to protect either\n\ndemolition workers or Bensenville residents who live in the Acquisition Area or in the vicinity.\n\nMundt identified hazardous substances that are likely present in the structures or soils in the\n\nAcquisition Area:\n\n               \"Based on the mix of industrial, commercial, and residential structures in the\n\n        Acquisition Area (as well as the historical uses of the area), it is highly likely that the\n\n        following hazardous or toxic substances are present in the structures to be demolished (or in\n\n        the surrounding soils and groundwater):        lead, mercury, pesticides, insecticides and\n\n        herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chemical wood preservatives such as chromate\n\n        copper arsenate, pentachlorophenols, creosote, paint and solvent compounds containing\n\n        volatile organic compounds, petroleum wastes containing benzene and PAHs (polycyclic\n\n        aromatic hydrocarbons), pathogenic mold spores, and septic system wastes containing\n\n        bacterial and viral pathogens.\"\n\nMundt stated that these substances can, depending on their concentrations, cause \"severe adverse\n\nhealth effects including lung diseases, central nervous system damage, learning disabilities in\n\nchildren, cancer, birth defects, liver damage, and damage to reproductive systems.\" Mundt cautioned\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthat a full list of the hazardous substances in the Acquisition Area was not possible until the area was\n\ncomprehensively investigated and tested.\n\n       Mundt described a three-step process that he recommended be completed before demolition.\n\nThe first step is a comprehensive area-wide field investigation and sampling. This step involves\n\nidentifying \"the locations, types, and quantities of hazardous or toxic materials in and around the\n\nstructures to be demolished.\" Mundt contrasted this approach with Chicago's proposed method of\n\ntesting, which he criticized as \"start-stop\" because Chicago intended to test and demolish piecemeal\n\nrather than test the site in full before commencing demolition. Mundt opined that Chicago's method\n\nwas inadequate because it failed to consider the additive or cumulative effects of releases from\n\nmultiple parcels or structures.\n\n       The second step, according to Mundt, is to develop a baseline risk assessment, which\n\ninvolves using data from the field-testing stage to calculate the degree to which demolition will\n\nexpose to hazardous substances demolition workers and residents living in the Acquisition Area or\n\nits vicinity. If the exposure is likely to exceed \"accepted levels of public health protection,\" then\n\nstrict controls are necessary to reduce the exposure to acceptable levels. Mundt averred that, since\n\nChicago did not perform proper field testing, it necessarily could not have performed a proper risk\n\nassessment.\n\n       The third step, explained Mundt, is to establish \"sufficiently strict control measures\" to insure\n\nthat levels of exposure do not exceed \"accepted levels of public health protection.\" Mundt opined\n\nthat, since Chicago did not perform proper field testing or prepare a proper risk assessment, Chicago\n\nhas no basis for claiming that its demolition proposal will adequately protect public health.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In his declaration, Travers, a geologist, noted that Bensenville's Demolition Ordinance\n\nrequires an applicant for a demolition permit to submit plans for (in his words):                (1) \"a\n\ncomprehensive investigation of the location, type, and quantity of hazardous chemical[s] and\n\nmaterials in the entire area to be demolished\"; and (2) demolition controls that \"minimiz[e] the\n\npublic health risk from release of those hazardous chemicals during demolition.\" Travers opined that\n\nthe Demolition Ordinance \"is a carefully developed and organized set of requirements designed to\n\nprotect the public health and safety of Bensenville residents and their families from exposure to\n\nhazardous or toxic chemicals and materials that may be released during demolition activities.\"\n\nTravers averred that Chicago's compliance with the Demolition Ordinance was \"essential\" for public\n\nprotection.\n\n       At a July 2007 hearing on the motion for injunctive relief, the trial court held that count I did\n\nnot provide a basis for an injunction because plaintiffs were not likely to succeed on the merits. The\n\ncourt reasoned that the Demolition Ordinance was preempted by section 25 of the Act, which\n\nprovides that \"[a]irport property shall not be subject to the laws of any unit of local government\n\nexcept as provided by ordinance of [Chicago].\" 620 ILCS 65/25 (West 2006). The court did,\n\nhowever, find a basis for injunctive relief in count II, alleging a public nuisance. The court entered\n\na preliminary injunction:\n\n       \"against [Chicago] on any further demolition of any kind or nature within [the Acquisition\n\n       Area] until an area-wide field investigation and sampling program is done identifying any\n\n       location, type and quantities of hazardous or toxic materials in or around the structures to be\n\n       demolished in the demolition area.\"\n\nAs for the duration of the injunction, the court said:\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       \"Once that area-wide field investigation and sampling program has been completed, then we\n\n       will hold an evidentiary hearing in regard to the findings that have been made, any expert\n\n       testimony that either Bensenville or [Chicago] may wish to put forth in open court, and any\n\n       other testimony that may be relevant in regard to same for this Court to make a determination\n\n       whether [the] preliminary injunction [should continue] *** or whether [it] [should] terminate\n\n       at that point with there being sufficient safeguards and protection for the public health of\n\n       those residents of Bensenville and the surrounding areas to satisfy this Court.\"\n\nThe court put the matter over for status.\n\n       In October 2007, plaintiffs filed a four-count amended complaint. Count I alleged common-\n\nlaw fraud, in that Chicago knowingly made to property owners in the Acquisition Area false\n\nstatements that all of their parcels are necessary for completion of the OMP. Plaintiffs alleged,\n\nwithout elaboration, that, \"[w]ith the exception of one parcel of property owned by [Bensenville],\"\n\nnone of the properties in the Acquisition Area are needed for Phase 1 of the OMP. Plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat only a portion of Phase 1 received the requisite approval from the \"Majority-In-Interest Airlines\"\n\n(MII Airlines) at O'Hare. Plaintiffs asserted that only Phase 2 could possibly warrant acquisition of\n\nplaintiffs' properties in the Acquisition Area but that Phase 2 was unlikely ever to be completed,\n\nbecause the MII Airlines probably would not approve Phase 2 given its projected cost. Plaintiffs\n\nasserted that Chicago knows that completion of Phase 2 is unlikely and that Phase 2 \"is little more\n\nthan a public relations creation by Chicago to provide a false justification for acquiring and\n\ndestroying the residential and commercial properties in the Acquisition Area.\"\n\n       Count II of the complaint pleaded constructive fraud based on the same false statements\n\nalleged in count I. Count III reasserted the first complaint's claim that the Demolition Ordinance\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ngoverns the demolition of properties in the Acquisition Area. Count IV realleged that the demolition\n\nwould constitute a public nuisance if it proceeded under the plans proposed by Chicago.\n\n       Chicago moved to dismiss counts I through III, pursuant to section 2--615 of the Code of\n\nCivil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2--615 (West 2006)). The trial court granted the motion as to\n\ncounts I and II but not count III. The court dismissed count I on the grounds that: (1) Chicago's\n\nstatements as to Acquisition Area properties' necessity for the OMP were legal opinions based on\n\nstatutory or constitutional criteria for condemnation and therefore were not proper subjects of a fraud\n\naction, pursuant to Stern v. Norwest Mortgage, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2011301\"><a href=\"/opinion/2011301/stern-v-norwest-mortg-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996); (2) Chicago's\n\nstatements that it would use the properties for either Phase 1 or Phase 2 were statements of future\n\nintent and therefore not actionable as fraud (see People ex rel.

The court noted that the dismissal of counts I and II was without prejudice.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       In November 2007, Chicago filed with the court a status report regarding its plans for\n\nsurveying and sampling the Acquisition Area as previously ordered by the court. Chicago informed\n\nthe court that it had retained the firm of Conestoga-Rovers and Associates (CRA) to conduct the\n\ninvestigation. The court set July 7, 2008, for an evidentiary hearing on whether the preliminary\n\ninjunction should continue.\n\n       On March 11, 2008, plaintiffs filed a five-count, second amended complaint. Count I of the\n\nsecond amended complaint was entitled \"Declaration and Injunctive Relief as to the Constitutionality\n\nof the O'Hare Modernization Act.\" In their foundational allegations, plaintiffs averred that Chicago\n\n\"has acquired--either through eminent domain or threat of eminent domain--several hundred ***\n\nresidential and commercial properties in Bensenville in the Acquisition Area.\" Plaintiffs further\n\nalleged that Chicago is currently seeking to acquire through eminent domain plaintiffs' own\n\nproperties.\n\n       Plaintiffs pleaded for two declarations. First, plaintiffs sought a declaration that the Act does\n\nnot override the requirement of article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution, the takings clause,\n\nthat \"the courts *** decide after an evidentiary hearing whether any particular parcel is necessary\"\n\nfor a public purpose.

In support, plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat only a portion of the OMP's Phase 1, i.e., the \"Phase 1 Airfield Project,\" was currently in\n\nprogress. Plaintiffs further alleged that, \"[w]ith the exception of a small number of properties on the\n\nnorth end of the so-called 'Acquisition Area,' Chicago has no need for any properties in Bensenville\n\nfor [Phase 1]--or the Phase 1 Airfield Project.\" With respect to Phase 2, plaintiffs averred that \"there\n\nis no certainty that [Phase 2] will be constructed within any reasonable period of time as required\n\nby the necessity limitations of the Illinois Constitution.\" Plaintiffs alleged that, \"despite this lack of\n\nnecessity for property in Bensenville, Chicago has acquired--through eminent domain proceedings\n\nor the threat of eminent domain--several hundred residential and commercial properties in\n\nBensenville on the false assertion that these properties are necessary\" for the OMP.\n\n        In addition to declaratory relief, plaintiffs asked that Chicago be ordered to restore \"to their\n\nprior state and condition\" the properties it \"acquired\" from the Acquisition Area. Plaintiffs also\n\nasked that Chicago be enjoined from \"further acquisitions\" of property in Bensenville \"under any\n\nclaim that the properties are necessary\" for the OMP, until Chicago proves its compliance with the\n\nconstitutional necessity requirement.\n\n        Count II pleaded common-law fraud. Plaintiffs made the following core allegations:\n\n                \"(A) False statement of material fact. Here the false statements of material fact are\n\n        Chicago's false factual allegations made to meet the necessity requirement of the Illinois\n\n        Constitution.\n\n                        i.

That all of the properties in [the] Acquisition Area are needed for thefuture\n\n             [Phase 2] and that the necessity requirement of the Illinois Constitution is met\n\n             because [Phase 2] will be constructed by 2014. This statement of future need is false\n\n             because Chicago has no basis in fact to assert that [Phase 2] will be constructed by\n\n             2014 or any future date, if ever.\n\n             (B) Defendant's knowledge that the statement is false. Chicago knows that its\n\n      factual assertions as set forth in paragraph (A) are false.\n\n             (C) Defendant's intent that the false statement induce the Plaintiffs to act.\n\n      *** Here Chicago knew and intended its false factual statements as to necessity would cause\n\n      many property owners to sell their homes and businesses under threat of eminent domain.\n\n      The false statements by Chicago as to the facts--i.e., that Chicago had demonstrated a factual\n\n      basis of constitutional necessity in accordance with the Illinois Constitution's limitations on\n\n      the power of eminent domain--were made to property owners who sold their homes and\n\n      businesses under threat of eminent domain and to the DuPage [sic] County Circuit Court\n\n      which unwittingly accepted these assertions as the truth.\n\n             (D) Plaintiffs' reliance on the truth of the false statement.

Plaintiffs pleaded that \"Chicago has improperly and\n\nunjustly obtained and continue[s] to retain the use of the properties in the Acquisition Area by\n\nviolating the necessity limits of the Illinois Constitution and by false statements as to necessity.\"\n\n       Count IV realleged the claim from the prior complaints that demolition in the Acquisition\n\nArea was governed by the Demolition Ordinance. Count V realleged the public nuisance claim from\n\nthe prior complaints.\n\n       Plaintiffs also filed a motion for injunctive relief under counts I through III of the second\n\namended complaint. Also, under count V, plaintiffs sought the same injunctive relief that was\n\ncurrently in place. Plaintiffs did so to preserve the status quo in the event the court dissolved the\n\ninjunction at the July 2008 evidentiary hearing.\n\n       On April 11, 2008, Chicago moved to dismiss counts I and IV, pursuant to section 2--619\n\nof the Code (735 ILCS 5/2--619 (West 2006)), and counts II and III pursuant to section 2--615 of the\n\nCode. Plaintiffs filed a response to the motion. To particularize their allegations of fraud in count\n\nII, plaintiffs attached an affidavit from Joseph Del Balzo, former acting administrator of the FAA.\n\nDel Balzo averred that he reviewed documents relating to the OMP and found that Phase 1 requires\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -13-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nonly 33 properties in the Acquisition Area, not 615 properties as Chicago claimed. Del Balzo further\n\ndetermined that none of the documents indicates an estimated completion date for Phase 2.\n\n       On June 26, 2008, the trial court dismissed counts I and IV under section 2--619 and counts\n\nII and III under section 2--615. The court first addressed the grounds for dismissing counts I and IV.\n\nThe court construed count I as alleging \"that Chicago's acquisition of properties in Bensenville is\n\nunconstitutional because those properties are not necessary, as required by the Illinois Constitution.\"\n\nThe court proceeded from the premise that, \"[if] property is not necessary for [a] public project, there\n\nis no constitutional authority to take the property--despite what the Legislature has asserted in the\n\nauthorizing statute.\" The court distinguished between properties owned by plaintiffs, which Chicago\n\nis presently attempting to acquire in the proceedings before Judge Culliton, and all other properties\n\nin the Acquisition Area, which the court noted were \"owned by individuals who contracted with\n\nChicago for the sale of those properties.\"3\n\n       The trial court held that plaintiffs' claims respecting their own properties were barred on the\n\nground that there is \"another action pending between the same parties for the same cause\" (735 ILCS\n\n5/2--619(a)(3) (West 2006)), namely, the eminent domain action before Judge Culliton. The trial\n\ncourt found that the proceedings before Judge Culliton could provide plaintiffs \"complete relief\"\n\nwith respect to their own properties. As for the remaining properties, the trial court held that\n\nplaintiffs lacked standing to challenge their acquisition by Chicago.

On count II, the court reasoned:\n\n                 \"This court reaches the same conclusion it reached the last time plaintiffs presented\n\n       a fraud claim--the alleged damages are speculative at best. The acquired properties are to be\n\n       used for the benefit of the State of Illinois, and there is no evidence that Chicago plans to use\n\n       them for anything else.       Assurance as to future events is generally not considered\n\n       misrepresentation of fact. [Citation.] As such, Chicago's stated intention to use the acquired\n\n       properties for the [OMP] cannot be considered fraud. In addition, a legal position, even if\n\n       alleged to be wrong, is not fraud. [Citation.] Therefore, Chicago's legal position that it has\n\n       discretion (granted by the Illinois legislature) to determine what parcels of land it requires\n\n       for completion of the [OMP] cannot be considered a fraudulent statement.\"\n\nOn count III, the court said:\n\n\n\n\n       4\n           Plaintiffs did not argue, and the trial court did not on its own consider, what standing\n\nBensenville might have as the municipality in whose territorial boundaries another government body\n\nseeks to acquire property by eminent domain.\n\n                                                 -15-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       \" 'To state a cause of action for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must allege the defendant\n\n       unjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiff's detriment, and the defendant's retention violated\n\n       the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and good conscience.'

In addition, Chicago paid for each of the acquired properties in real\n\n       estate contracts with former owners of those properties. 'Where there is a specific contract\n\n       which governs the relationship of the parties, the doctrine of unjust enrichment has no\n\n       application.' [Citation.]\"\n\n       The court also denied, as moot, plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief under counts I through\n\nIII. On June 30, 2008, plaintiffs petitioned this court for leave to take an interlocutory appeal from\n\nthe denial of their motion. This court denied the petition.\n\n       On July 7-10, 2008, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on whether its injunction\n\nshould continue against demolition of the properties in the Acquisition Area. Chicago presented its\n\ncase first, and its first witness was Fred Blickle, an environmental engineer with CRA and an expert\n\nin developing and evaluating plans for the decommissioning and demolition of residential,\n\ncommercial, or industrial structures. Blickle explained that \"decommissioning\" is the process of\n\nremoving potentially hazardous material from a structure before demolishing it. Blickle testified that\n\nCRA was hired to perform an area-wide testing and investigation program in the Acquisition Area,\n\nto evaluate the results of the program, and to develop a decommissioning and demolition program\n\nthat would protect public health.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -16-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Blickle first explained the nature and scope of the testing and investigation. CRA inspected\n\nand sampled both structures and soils in the Acquisition Area. With respect to structures, CRA\n\ninspected \"600 plus\" parcels in the Acquisition Area and looked for any \"material[s] of concern that\n\nshould be decommissioned prior to demolition.\" CRA inspected the structures for lead and asbestos\n\nand for \"waste,\" subdivided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) into\n\nuniversal waste (fluorescent bulbs, batteries), household waste (cooking oils, cleaning agents,\n\npesticides), and hazardous waste (determined by a specialized test). CRA found materials containing\n\nasbestos. CRA did not test for lead in applied paint on the structures but, rather, assumed that there\n\nwas lead in all applied paint and planned to decommission the structures accordingly.\n\n       Blickle testified that CRA's inspection for waste included testing areas of concern, like\n\nstained concrete. This sampling was guided by the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. §2601\n\net seq. 2000)), which Blickle described as \"the only procedure prescribed by the [USEPA] for\n\nsampling solid materials.\" CRA gathered 4,400 samples in all and sent them to an independent lab\n\nto be tested for the presence of hazardous waste according to the criteria of the Resource\n\nConservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. §6901 et seq. (2000)). Blickle testified\n\nthat CRA found household and universal waste but no hazardous waste in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Blickle then explained CRA's methodology for soil sampling. CRA conducted two types of\n\nsampling: (1) sampling in areas of potential environmental concern (PECs); and (2) grid sampling.\n\nCRA identified PEC sites based on historical data showing the likely presence of contaminants in\n\nthe soil. Grid sampling consisted of random testing within a grid of acre-sized lots imposed on a\n\nmap of the Acquisition Area (with no overlap with PEC testing). Blickle testified that grid sampling\n\nwas not required by the USEPA but that CRA did it as an extra precaution. Blickle testified that\n\n\n\n                                                -17-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nCRA took samples at approximately 170 PEC sites and approximately 200 grid sites. About 400\n\ndiscrete samples were taken in all.5 CRA took samples at depths recommended by a document\n\nentitled \"Soil Screening Guidance: User's Guide,\" promulgated by the USEPA. CRA was not able\n\nto complete testing at 21 of the PEC sites because of \"access issues.\" Blickle testified that he was\n\nconfident that nothing was present at these 21 PEC sites that CRA had not already encountered\n\nelsewhere in the Acquisition Area. Blickle testified that CRA selected the chemicals for which to\n\ntest a PEC sample based on the contaminants, e.g., petroleum, that the usage history of the site\n\nindicated would likely be present in the soil. Blickle testified that grid samples were tested for\n\nsubstances listed on the Priority Pollutant List established by the Federal Water Pollution Control\n\nAct, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §1317 (2000)).\n\n       Blickle testified that the test results for each chemical were compared against the soil\n\nscreening level for that chemical. Blickle used soil screening levels developed by Dr. Elizabeth\n\nAnderson of Exponent Corporation. Blickle testified that Dr. Anderson's screening levels are\n\nconservative and that an exceedance does not necessarily indicate that disturbance of the soil will\n\nbe a risk to public health. Blickle testified that 99% of the PEC samples and 99% of the grid\n\nsamples were below the screening levels. Blickle testified that the exceedances that were found\n\nwould not preclude demolition, because CRA had measures to control emission of contaminants\n\nwithin levels acceptable for public safety.\n\n\n\n       5\n           There is some equivocation in the record between a \"parcel\" and a sampling \"site\" or\n\n\"location.\" From what we gather, CRA took samples at 370 \"locations\" or \"sites\" within the 615\n\nlegal parcels that comprise the Acquisition Area. A given parcel might contain more than one\n\nsampling site or location, and multiple samples might be taken at a given sampling site or location.\n\n                                               -18-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Blickle then described CRA's planned decommissioning procedures. Blickle testified that\n\nCRA intends to remove all waste that can be \"practically\" taken from the structures. As for asbestos,\n\nBlickle noted that the handling and disposition of materials containing asbestos is controlled by the\n\nNational Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) (40 C.F.R. §61 et seq.\n\n(2008)), a series of federal regulations. Blickle explained that asbestos is of two types: \"Regulated\n\nAsbestos Containing Material\" (RACM) and non-RACM.                      The USEPA and the Illinois\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (IEPA) both must be notified of the presence of RACM in a\n\nstructure designated for demolition. Prior to demolition, RACM must be entirely removed from the\n\nstructure by a demolition contractor licensed in asbestos abatement. Non-RACM need not be\n\nremoved prior to demolition. Blickle explained that, though such a measure is not required by law,\n\nCRA will dismantle rather than crush or implode structures containing non-RACM. As for lead,\n\nCRA will assume that all applied paint contains lead and will remove all flaked or flaking paint.\n\n        Blickle next described the demolition controls that CRA developed to keep emissions of\n\ncontaminants to safe levels during demolition. CRA will enclose the demolition area to exclude the\n\npublic and will maintain a \"buffer zone\" between the demolition area and occupied properties. CRA\n\nwill apply water to all structures to control release of dust and will use silk screens to filter the water\n\nrunning off the structures. Blickle characterized the wetting of structures as CRA's \"primary\" control\n\non dust. CRA will also vacuum around the structures with a device designed to catch particles down\n\nto .3 microns in size. In addition, CRA will implement a \"real time\" air monitoring program in an\n\neffort to confine \"visible dust\" to the demolition area, per the dictates of the NESHAP. CRA will\n\nmonitor airborne asbestos according to the standards of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response\n\nAct of 1986 (AHERA) (15 U.S.C. §2461 et seq. (2000)) and lead levels according to the National\n\n\n\n                                                   -19-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nPrimary & Secondary Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) (40 C.F.R. §50.1 et seq. (2008)).\n\nCRA derived from the AHERA and the NAAQS certain \"action\" and \"trigger\" levels for lead and\n\nasbestos. If an action level is exceeded, CRA will take corrective measures while continuing\n\ndemolition. If a trigger is exceeded, CRA will cease demolition altogether until it achieves\n\ncompliance with the emission standards. In addition to the foregoing, CRA will monitor the air for\n\nvolatile organic compounds. Blickle admitted that CRA will not monitor for substances other than\n\nlead, asbestos, and volatile organic compounds. Blickle explained that demolition teams \"never\n\nmonitor for every constituent that's present, no matter what the site.\" The custom rather is to \"select\n\ntarget compounds, indicator parameters to gauge your monitoring program.\"\n\n        Blickle testified that CRA will further minimize soil disturbance by demolishing just to the\n\n\"pad\" or slab of a structure and by filling basements with concrete rather than digging out the walls.\n\nBlickle opined that CRA's demolition controls will insure that no \"appreciable\" deposition of\n\nchemicals will occur in residential areas inside or outside the demolition area. Blickle admitted that\n\nCRA made no quantitative estimate of \"what would come off the site during demolition.\" CRA saw\n\nno need to make that calculation, because its controls \"are protective of any type of generation of that\n\nmaterial\" and it did not believe \"anything is going to come off\" the site during demolition.\n\n        Blickle acknowledged an October 31, 1997, letter from the IEPA to Nelson Steel & Wire,\n\nwhich had occupied in the Acquisition Area a parcel that is now the site of Pro Logis. The letter\n\nimplies that at the site there had been some environmental issue for which remediation had been\n\nrequired. The letter refers to presently contaminated soil at the site but states that \"no further\n\nremediation\" is required at the site as long as certain terms are followed. The letter states in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n\n\n                                                  -20-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      \"PREVENTIVE, ENGINEERING, AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTROLS\n\n      3.

Dr. Anderson testified\n\nthat a proper assessment of the risk posed by a proposed demolition has three steps: (1)\n\ncharacterizing the demolition site, which involves identifying chemicals of potential concern; (2)\n\nidentifying potential receptors of emissions and pathways of exposure, such as inhalation and\n\ningestion; and (3) determining the overall risk on the basis of the qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nThe aim of the risk assessment approach is to insure that contaminants are not released in levels that\n\ncan threaten public health.\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, in her professional opinion, Blickle's plan for decommissioning\n\nthe structures, controlling dust, and monitoring for lead and asbestos was suitably protective of\n\npublic health. To evaluate the risk posed by soil disturbance, Dr. Anderson used a specialized risk\n\n\n\n                                                  -22-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nassessment paradigm called the \"screening level approach,\" which is approved by both the USEPA\n\nand the IEPA. Dr. Anderson explained that the aim of the screening level approach is to calculate\n\nthe maximum soil concentration at which a substance, if released during a soil disturbance, will not\n\nendanger public health. Dr. Anderson drew her soil screening levels from the baseline values\n\nprovided in the \"Tiered Approach to Corrective Action Objectives\" (TACO) (35 Ill. Adm. Code\n\n§742.100 et seq., adopted at 21 Ill. Reg. 7942, eff. July 1, 1997, as amended) promulgated by the\n\nIEPA.6 Dr. Anderson explained that TACO assumes that there has been both \"a hazardous release\"\n\nand \"an enforcement action\" and, accordingly, prescribes soil screening levels by which to plan\n\nappropriate corrective action. TACO may also be used \"voluntarily,\" as she did here, where the issue\n\nis the risk involved in a prospective soil disturbance. Dr. Anderson testified that TACO soil\n\nscreening levels are calculated differently for carcinogenic substances than for noncarcinogenic\n\nsubstances. Under TACO, exposure to carcinogenic substances must not cause greater than a 1 in\n\n1 million (1 x 10-6) chance of developing cancer over one's lifetime. Risk associated with\n\nnoncarcinogenic substances, however, is measured not as a probability but as a hazard quotient, or\n\n\"the ratio of the expected exposure to the regulatory limit.\" Under TACO, the hazard quotient for\n\nnoncarcinogenic substances must not exceed one.\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that TACO considers the risk that demolition poses to both demolition\n\nworkers and adjacent residents. TACO provides three tiers of screening values. Tier 1 provides\n\n\n\n       6\n           It became apparent in later testimony that Dr. Anderson provided screening levels for\n\nchemicals she considered relevant to the risk analysis and did so independently of Blickle's test\n\nresults. Therefore, it was possible that Dr. Anderson calculated screening levels for chemicals that\n\nBlickle never detected.\n\n                                               -23-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nscreening values for a certain baseline scenario, and Tiers 2 and 3 allow for modification of those\n\nvalues if the circumstances of a chemical release from soils differ materially from the Tier 1\n\nscenario. Dr. Anderson explained that Tier 1 presupposes a release of contaminants due to a \"very\n\ngentle soil disturbance.\" Tier 1 also presupposes an exposure duration of 30 years for adjacent\n\nresidents and 30 days for demolition workers. Dr. Anderson modified the Tier 1 scenario in several\n\nways. First, she assumed, commensurate with the length of the planned demolition, that both\n\nresidents and demolition workers in the Acquisition Area would be exposed to released chemicals\n\nfor 260 days. Dr. Anderson testified that the baseline 30-year exposure for residents was not realistic\n\nin this case because contaminants were found at \"very low levels\" in the Acquisition Area and\n\nBlickle's demolition controls would forestall any \"large depositions that would then cause long term\n\nrisk.\"\n\n         Second, Dr. Anderson assumed a greater soil disturbance than the baseline Tier 1 scenario\n\nand in fact employed a \"Particulate Emission Factor\" (PEF) 10 times more conservative than the Tier\n\n1 default factor.\n\n         Third, as a precautionary measure, Dr. Anderson assumed that residents in the Acquisition\n\nArea would inhale released contaminants to the same degree as demolition workers. Dr. Anderson\n\ndid not, however, assume any ingestion of contaminants by residents as she did for demolition\n\nworkers, because ingestion by residents was unlikely given the degree of Blickle's controls.\n\n         The fourth manner in which Dr. Anderson departed from Tier 1 was to use an additive risk\n\nanalysis according to the guidelines of Tier 3. Dr. Anderson explained that an additive risk analysis\n\nconsiders the combined effect of exposure to multiple contaminants. Dr. Anderson emphasized that\n\nthe additive risk analysis considers \"contaminants detected--not suspected, not possibilities.\" Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                 -24-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nAnderson also emphasized that the additive risk analysis considers separately the effects of\n\nnoncarcinogenic and carcinogenic substances; TACO does not permit the combining of carcinogenic\n\nand noncarcinogenic effects into a single risk value. Finally, the additive risk analysis segregates\n\neffects to different parts of the body. Dr. Anderson testified that the screening levels resulting from\n\nher adjustments were more rigorous overall than even the conservative Tier 1 levels.\n\n          Dr. Anderson then described Blickle's test results and his comparison of them to her\n\nscreening levels.     Dr. Anderson noted that Blickle's test results showed \"very, very low\"\n\nconcentrations of contaminants in the Acquisition Area. Blickle took these concentrations and did\n\na \"chemical by chemical\" analysis, comparing each chemical to its screening level. Blickle found\n\nexceedances at 41 of the 370 locations he sampled. When Dr. Anderson did her own comparison\n\nusing the additive risk model, she found exceedances at only 11 locations sampled. Dr. Anderson\n\nattributed this somewhat counterintuitive disparity to the specialized nature of additive risk analysis\n\nunder TACO. For one, additive risk separates effects peculiar to discrete body parts; there is no\n\n\"mixing of body parts.\" Furthermore, under TACO, \"the cumulative risk of carcinogens [sic]\n\ncontaminants attacking the same target must not exceed 1 x 10-4,\" not the standard benchmark of 1\n\nx 10-6.\n\n          Dr. Anderson testified that, in an effort to be \"more public health protective,\" Blickle\n\ndesigned his controls based on the 41 site-exceedances derived from his chemical-by-chemical\n\nanalysis, not on the lower number of exceedances reached in Dr. Anderson's additive risk analysis.\n\nDr. Anderson noted that, of the 41 exceedance sites, no soil disturbance causing a release would\n\noccur at 25 of the sites because either there are no structures at all on those sites or the soil that is\n\ncontaminated is located below asphalt or concrete that will be undisturbed during demolition. Dr.\n\n\n\n                                                  -25-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nAnderson testified that another 12 of the 41 locations showed exceedances only for arsenic and\n\nbenzo(a)pyrene, and these were in concentrations at acceptable background levels that TACO sets\n\nfor chemicals found \"frequently in the environment.\" On yet another site, \"the limits of detection\n\nwere above the risk-base soil concentration levels,\" and Blickle \"had very generally just included [it]\n\nas a positive sample even though it was never detected.\" Thus, there remained just three sampling\n\nlocations with unmitigated exceedances.\n\n       Asked if CRA had taken enough samples at each sampling location to be confident that it had\n\nmeasured the highest concentration of each contaminant found at the location, Dr. Anderson\n\nanswered:\n\n               \"I suppose Mr. Blickle could have sampled every square inch. But that's not the point\n\n       of a sampling program.\n\n               The point of [a] sampling program is to capture the representative samples in a\n\nlocation.\"\n\nDr. Anderson further defended CRA's sampling program:\n\n               \"If you're doing a focus sampling plan and you're trying to sample particularly the\n\n       point where you think the concentration is going to be the highest and you don't really find\n\n       anything that is of enormous concern--we did not find huge levels of contamination at this\n\n       site--and then to proceed further to establish protective measures, I don't think you\n\n       necessarily need to establish sampling plans that just continue to sample and to sample and\n\n       to sample, when at this site, as I said ***, we really don't find that many enormous concerns.\n\n               We found very, very, few samples that exceeded the screening levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -26-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that CRA did not intend to remove the protective barrier in place at\n\nthe Nelson Wire/Pro Logis site, but, if there were a soil disturbance, \"it would need to be addressed\n\nwith the [IEPA].\"\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, in her professional opinion, the demolition planned by CRA will\n\nnot threaten public health because CRA's plan for decommissioning the Acquisition Area is\n\ncomprehensive and sound, the soil in the Acquisition Area has low concentrations of contaminants,\n\nand the demolition controls designed by CRA will adequately control emission of contaminants from\n\nthe structures and soils.\n\n       Plaintiffs' first witness was Stanley Popelar, a geologist and expert in site assessment\n\nemployed by Environ. Popelar's testimony was focused primarily on CRA's soil sampling program,\n\nwhich he found inadequate. Popelar emphasized first that soil samples were taken at a relatively\n\nsmall number of legal parcels in the Acquisition Area. Popelar noted that CRA took samples at only\n\n147 of the 615 parcels in the Acquisition Area. Moreover, CRA identified 61 PEC parcels but took\n\nsamples at only 37.7\n\n       Popelar criticized CRA's general sampling methodology. Popelar testified that CRA's PEC\n\nsampling concentrated almost exclusively on commercial and industrial properties even though\n\nresidential properties regularly contain such contaminants as lead from paint, pesticides, chemicals\n\n\n\n       7\n           Again, the testimony at the hearing draws a distinction between a parcel and a sampling\n\nlocation. As seen from Blickle's testimony, CRA often identified more than one sampling location\n\nwithin a given parcel and often took more than one discrete sample within a sampling location. Still,\n\nit is difficult to reconcile Blickle's testimony that only 24 PEC sampling sites remained to be tested\n\nwith Popelar's testimony that 37 legal parcels remained for PEC testing.\n\n                                                -27-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nfor treating lumber, heating oil residue, and household wastes. Popelar asserted that this deficiency\n\nin the PEC sampling was not remedied by the grid sampling, which also did not cover all residential\n\nproperties in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Popelar also criticized CRA's methodology with respect to the sites it did sample. Popelar\n\nnoted that, once CRA found a sample in a given location that tested positive for a contaminant, CRA\n\ndid not \"step out\" from the point of the sample, i.e., take further samples to determine the total\n\nquantity of that contaminant at the sampling location. Popelar testified that, without knowing the\n\ntotal quantity of a contaminant in an area, one cannot know what quantity of that contaminant will\n\nbe released during a soil disturbance, and, without knowing emission levels, one cannot design\n\nappropriate emission controls. Popelar also opined that CRA did not bore deeply enough when\n\ntaking samples. Additionally, in the residential properties that were grid-sampled, CRA \"typically\n\nput the soil borings out in the middle of the yard in areas [where CRA was] least likely to find\n\ncontamination, not near the structures, not near [the] sources of residential contaminants.\"\n\n       Popelar maintained that, though underground septic and heating oil tanks are common in\n\nresidential properties in the Acquisition Area, CRA did not search for such tanks in many of the\n\nresidential areas. Popelar identified specifically a residential area north of Irving Park Road in\n\nBensenville that CRA had not surveyed for septic or heating oil tanks.\n\n       Popelar concluded that CRA's sampling was \"not area-wide\" or \"comprehensive\" and that\n\nCRA failed to \"identify the maximum concentrations present and/or the quantities they might be\n\ndealing with.\" Popelar admitted that Environ did not take its own samples from the Acquisition\n\nArea. Robert Adams, also employed by Environ, testified that he has experience in developing and\n\nevaluating decommissioning and demolition plans. Adams testified that the basic shortcoming in\n\n\n\n                                                -28-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nCRA's demolition controls is that they are based on incomplete data. Adams observed that a large\n\nnumber of residential properties have not been sampled by CRA.           Even with respect to the\n\nproperties it has sampled, CRA has \"done no assessment or review to determine what kinds of\n\nemissions will be coming off the site during the demolition process.\" Because \"you need to know\n\nwhat is going to come off of the site [during demolition] to determine what the necessary controls\n\nare,\" CRA has no basis for claiming that its controls will limit emissions within levels consistent\n\nwith public health.\n\n       Adams also questioned aspects of CRA's air monitoring program. Adams asserted that\n\nCRA's monitoring system was not sufficiently comprehensive because asbestos, lead, and volatile\n\ncompounds are not reliable proxies for other contaminants, contrary to CRA's position. Adams also\n\nclaimed that CRA's lead monitoring instruments are not sensitive enough to detect emissions at\n\nCRA's proposed action and trigger levels.\n\n       Adams admitted that he has not taken samples from, or otherwise investigated or examined,\n\nthe Acquisition Area. He also admitted that he himself has made no estimate of the emission levels\n\nfor any contaminant that could be released during demolition.\n\n       Dr. Frank Jones, a toxicologist at Environ and an expert in risk assessment, testified to the\n\nmultiple points on which he disagreed with Dr. Anderson's screening level approach. First, Dr. Jones\n\ndisagreed with Dr. Anderson's rejection of ingestion as a possible pathway of exposure for residents\n\ninside or outside the Acquisition Area. Second, Dr. Jones challenged Dr. Anderson's PEF. Dr. Jones\n\nstated that TACO's baseline PEF is the \"Cowherd factor,\" which assumes \"just bare exposed soil\n\nwith wind blowing across the soil.\" Dr. Jones noted that Dr. Anderson, to account for the greater\n\nsoil agitation caused by demolition, simply multiplied the Cowherd factor by 10. Dr. Jones opined\n\n\n\n                                               -29-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthat, though TACO mandates multiplying the baseline factor by 10, there is no scientific basis for\n\nchoosing 10 as the multiplier. Dr. Jones dismissed TACO's enhanced PEF as \"simplistic\" and noted\n\nthat the USEPA has developed more sophisticated emissions factors.\n\n       Third, Dr. Jones asserted that Dr. Anderson was mistaken in substituting an exposure\n\nduration of 260 days for the 30-year default duration in TACO Tier 1. Dr. Jones explained that the\n\ndefault standard assumes that contaminants will travel from a demolition area into adjoining\n\nresidential areas and, once deposited, will cause continual exposure until dissipated or transported\n\nelsewhere. Dr. Anderson made the substitution because she believed there would be no deposition\n\nof material that could have long-term ill effects. Dr. Jones criticized this belief as unfounded\n\nbecause CRA had not measured the quantity of each contaminant in the soil and therefore had an\n\nincomplete picture of emission levels or deposition amounts. Dr. Jones cited a body of literature\n\nfinding that, even with \"dust suppression\" controls in place, demolition of structures causes\n\n\"significant levels of deposition of dust\" outside the demolition area. Dr. Jones concluded that Dr.\n\nAnderson had no cause for departing from the default exposure duration in TACO Tier 1. Dr. Jones\n\nadmitted, however, that the prevailing winds in the vicinity of the Acquisition Area blow from the\n\nsouthwest. Thus, the Acquisition Area, situated between O'Hare to the northeast and the remaining\n\nsections of Bensenville to the west and southwest, is mostly downwind from the other areas of\n\nBensenville.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that, though he disagreed with Dr. Anderson's screening levels, he did not\n\ncalculate his own screening levels but used Dr. Anderson's to perform an additive risk analysis that\n\nconsiders the combined effect of multiple agents. Dr. Jones employed the additive risk approach of\n\na USEPA document entitled \"Risk Assessment Guidance for Superfund, Volume I, Human Health\n\n\n\n                                               -30-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nEvaluation Manual\" (RAGS). The method of the RAGS involves dividing \"your acceptable risk\n\nlevel by the number of potential chemicals that your--that you may have present at the site.\" Dr.\n\nJones stressed that he considered the additive effects of carcinogens separately from the additive\n\neffects of noncarcinogens; he agreed that the RAGS does not allow one \"to take the noncancer risk\n\nand add it to the cancer risk to determine the total risk.\" Dr. Jones testified that he calculated the\n\nrespective additive risks for carcinogens and noncarcinogens by first adding together all screening\n\nlevels Dr. Anderson provided, which yielded a total screening level. He then divided this figure, in\n\nthe case of noncarcinogens, by 120 (the total number of chemicals for which Dr. Anderson provided\n\nscreening levels), and, in the case of carcinogens, by 50 (the total number of carcinogenic chemicals\n\nfor which Dr. Anderson provided screening levels). The higher divisor for noncarcinogens was\n\nnecessary because \"all chemicals have a noncarcinogenic effect, whether they are a carcinogen or\n\na noncarcinogen.\" Dr. Jones acknowledged that he divided the total screening value not \"by the\n\nchemicals actually detected\" but by \"the total number of chemicals for which [Dr. Anderson]\n\nprovided a screening level.\"8 He noted that, \"even if it was nondetected, [a] chemical might still\n\nhave been of concern.\" He explained in the following colloquy:\n\n                 \"Q. You used *** the substances that were listed in Dr. Anderson's table [of\n\n       screening values] did you not?\n\n                 A. That is correct.\n\n                 Q. And you mentioned that some of the chemicals she had listed came back as\n\n       nondetect; isn't that right?\n\n\n\n       8\n           It is implied here that Dr. Anderson created her list of screening values independently of\n\nwhat Blickle detected in the Acquisition Area.\n\n                                                 -31-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n               A. That is what I've been told this morning.\n\n               Q. Okay. And one of the problems with nondetect is that the sensitivity level of the\n\n       chemistry may be above the level of health concern; isn't that right?\n\n               A. That is--in the field of risk assessment, if you have a detection limit that is higher\n\n       than your health-based concern, you would assume that the chemical might still be there at\n\n       half the detection level.\n\n               Q. Because the limits of the chemical lab may be, you have the chemical there and\n\n       a health risk, but the laboratory isn't able to analyze it; is that correct?\n\n               A. Exactly.\"\n\nDr. Jones claimed that TACO dictates the same divisors as the RAGS for an additive risk analysis.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that, under the additive risk analysis of the RAGS, he found exceedances\n\nat 52 of CRA's sampling locations, compared to Blickle's 41 exceedances. If he had used the\n\nunmodified TACO Tier 1 values (a risk limit of 1 x 10-6, exposure through both ingestion and\n\ninhalation, and an exposure duration of 30 years), he would have found exceedances at \"most\" of\n\nCRA's sampling locations. Dr. Jones noted that, under TACO, if an additive risk analysis yields\n\nscreening values more rigorous than the Tier 1 values, \"the number[s] would default back to the Tier\n\n1 number[s].\" Dr. Jones considered this proviso in TACO \"policy-based\" not \"health-based.\" If not\n\nfor it, an additive risk analysis using the strict Tier 1 values would yield exceedances at every\n\nsampling location in the Acquisition Area. Dr. Jones admitted that he was \"supposed to calculate\n\nadditive risk by target organ\" but did not do so.\n\n       Dr. Jones testified that there were \"too many gaps\" in CRA's data for Chicago to conclude\n\nthat the demolition would not endanger public health. Particularly, CRA failed to calculate the total\n\n\n\n                                                 -32-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nquantities of contaminants found at each sampling location. Without this knowledge, CRA could\n\nnot develop appropriate demolition controls because, \"if you don't know what's there, you can't\n\ncontrol for it.\" Dr. Jones acknowledged that it is acceptable to obtain the average concentration of\n\na contaminant at a sampling location as long as the range of sampling is broad enough. CRA,\n\nhowever, did not attempt to find the average concentration at any sampling location.\n\n        Michael Paige, a Bensenville official responsible for insuring compliance with the village's\n\ncodes, testified that he met with Chicago officials to discuss the proposed demolition. During these\n\nmeetings, he informed Chicago officials about the likelihood of underground storage tanks and septic\n\nfields in the residential areas north of Irving Park Road. Paige also testified that, as of the hearing,\n\n13 residential parcels in the Acquisition Area were still occupied.\n\n        Kenneth Mundt, who had submitted a sworn declaration in support of plaintiffs' original\n\nmotion for injunctive relief, testified that he was the leader of the team of Environ employees who\n\nevaluated CRA's proposed decommissioning and demolition procedures. Mundt and his team tested\n\nCRA's work against the risk assessment framework Mundt had laid out in his sworn declaration.\n\nThis three-stage method consists of: (1) conducting a \"comprehensive area-wide sampling plan,\"\n\nwhich involves measuring the \"concentration, quantity[,] and type of contaminants\" in the area\n\ndesignated for demolition and calculating the extent to which the demolition will expose demolition\n\nworkers, and residents in the vicinity, to contaminants; (2) determining whether the likely exposure,\n\nif any, is consistent with acceptable levels of public health protection; and (3) developing measures\n\nto limit exposure to within acceptable levels. Mundt testified that step one is \"critical\" for the others\n\nbecause if \"good scientific data\" is lacking, \"whatever controls are based on [the] improper risk\n\nassessment might not be adequately protective.\"\n\n\n\n                                                  -33-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Mundt opined that CRA did not conduct step one properly. Mundt asserted that CRA's\n\nsurvey of the demolition site was deficient because CRA did not take PEC samples at all residential\n\nproperties, where the soils likely contained pesticides and lead from exterior paint. Mundt also noted\n\nthat CRA did not test for pesticides in any grid or PEC sample even though they were likely present\n\nin the Acquisition Area. Mundt considered these gaps in data \"irresponsible.\" Also, Mundt\n\nconsidered grid sampling intrinsically flawed as a sampling methodology because it is not directed\n\nby historical property use. Mundt testified that he did not consider grid sampling appropriate \"for\n\nany purpose\" and did not believe that the USEPA approves grid sampling.\n\n       Mundt criticized CRA's sampling program for the additional reason that it did not utilize\n\n\"stepping out\" sampling. Mundt noted that \"stepping out\" sampling is important because, \"[i]f levels\n\nof contaminants exceed certain thresholds, we would then want to know whether we were at the very\n\nedge of the contaminated area, [or] at the center of it.\" \"Stepping out\" sampling \"confirm[s] what\n\nthe highest concentrations are of a particular contaminant of concern as well as the quantity of the\n\nparticular contaminant of concern.\" Mundt admitted that he is not trained in soil sampling and has\n\nnever taken soil samples himself. Mundt also admitted that Environ did no soil sampling of its own\n\nbut simply critiqued CRA's methods.         Mundt concluded that, because CRA's sampling was\n\ninadequate, there was insufficient data \"to make a scientifically or technically supportable judgment\n\nthat going forward with the demolition at this time would not pose a significant health risk\" to\n\nresidential areas in or near the Acquisition Area.\n\n       In rebuttal, Chicago called Dr. Anderson, who addressed Dr. Jones' criticisms of her risk\n\nassessment methods and also critiqued his proposed methods. Dr. Anderson testified that a proper\n\nrisk assessment of the planned demolition in the Acquisition Area did not require her to measure the\n\n\n\n                                                -34-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ntotal quantity of each contaminant in a sampling location because she used a soil disturbance model\n\nthat assumed \"limitless amounts of contaminant in the soil.\" Referencing Dr. Jones' additive risk\n\nmethod, Dr. Anderson asserted that she knows of no government agency that prescribes including\n\n\"suspected\" or \"non-detected\" chemicals in the divisor for additive risk analysis. Dr. Anderson\n\nsuggested that such a method is \"arbitrary\" and \"make[s] no sense.\" Dr. Anderson followed instead\n\nTACO's additive risk method, which provides that the divisor need include only chemicals \"actually\n\ndetected at the site.\" Dr. Anderson noted that Dr. Jones, by his own admission, did not \"develop his\n\nscreening levels based on target organs.\" Dr. Anderson suggested that Dr. Jones' analysis was further\n\nflawed because \"he combined the cancer risk and the non-cancer risk to the same chemical to come\n\nup with his screening level.\"\n\n       Dr. Anderson testified that, since her testimony in Chicago's case-in-chief, she recalculated\n\nher screening levels using straightforward Tier 1 factors and found exceedances at 37 sampling\n\nlocations. Dr. Anderson testified that this was the same number of exceedances Popelar found when\n\nhe applied Dr. Jones' screening levels.\n\n       In surrebuttal, Dr. Jones testified that, since his testimony in plaintiffs' case-in-chief, he redid\n\nhis additive risk model using the number of chemicals detected, not merely suspected. The result\n\nwas still a set of screening levels that fell below TACO Tier 1 baseline norms (but that defaulted to\n\nthe Tier 1 standards due to TACO's reversionary clause). Dr. Jones admitted that he combined the\n\ncarcinogenic risk with the noncarcinogenic risk for at least three chemicals for which he provided\n\nscreening levels. Dr. Jones claimed that this was an \"inadvertent\" error and that he was \"a little\n\nsloppy\" in calculating his screening levels. Dr. Jones noted that, for the three examples he identified,\n\nthe noncarcinogenic risk had such a low value that it added virtually nothing to the carcinogenic risk.\n\n\n\n                                                  -35-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       On August 7, 2008, in a lengthy written opinion, the trial court dissolved the preliminary\n\ninjunction against Chicago's demolition of structures in the Acquisition Area. The trial court began\n\nwith a general overview of the evidence:\n\n               \"The Defendant, City of Chicago, presented two expert witnesses, Mr. Fred Blickle\n\n       of Conestoga-Rovers and Associates ('CRA') and Dr. Elizabeth Anderson of Exponent, Inc.\n\n       ('Exponent'), in support of its position: (i) that proper precautionary measures will be taken\n\n       during demolition to prevent unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful materials in the\n\n       Acquisition Area; (ii) that Plaintiffs' contention that the Acquisition Area presents significant\n\n       uncontrollable risks to public health is without foundation; and (iii) that Plaintiffs' claims of\n\n       endangerment were not only inaccurate and speculative at the time they were made\n\n       (particularly since they were not based on any investigation, sampling, testing, or modeling\n\n       of the Acquisition Area by the Plaintiffs), but[,] moreover[,] have no legitimate evidentiary\n\n       basis, now that there has been extensive area-wide investigation and sampling of the\n\n       Acquisition Area.\n\n               The Plaintiff[s], Village of Bensenville et al., countered with their position as\n\n       presented by their four expert witnesses, Mr. Stanley Popelar, Dr. Frank Jones, Mr. Robert\n\n       Adams, and Dr. Kenneth Mundt, all of ENVIRON International Corporation ('ENVIRON'),\n\n       that it is premature to determine whether there will be endangerment to the public health,\n\n       because more investigation and sampling must first be done in the Acquisition Area.\n\n       Although Plaintiffs' experts acknowledged that they have not investigated, sampled[,] or\n\n       tested the Acquisition Area at any time and consequently have no data of their own on which\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -36-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       to base their contentions ***, Plaintiffs nonetheless contend that no demolition activities can\n\n       now proceed.\"\n\n       To illustrate what it considered the pith of the controversy between the parties, the trial court\n\ncollected the following subject headings from plaintiffs' proposed order and findings of fact:\n\n       \"A.

The area-wide field\n\n       investigation and sampling program that I ordered Chicago to complete was in fact\n\n       completed.\n\n               I was privileged to hear the expert testimony of both Plaintiff's [sic] and Defendant's\n\n       [sic] over the course of the four day hearing. Through that testimony, I 'became educated'\n\n       in regard to the standards of the United States Environmental Protection Agency; the Illinois\n\n       EPA; the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, the Asbestos\n\n       'NESHAP'; regulated ACM and non RACM; the Asbestos Hazardous Emergency Response\n\n       Act ('AHERA'); the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for Lead ('NAAQS'); risk\n\n\n\n                                                -38-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      assessment procedures promulgated by the IEPA in its regulatory program called 'Tiered\n\n      Approach to Corrective Action Objectives,' Tier 1 and Tier 3 ('TACO'); as well as the Illinois\n\n      EPA's previously issued No Further Remediation Letter ('NFR') on October 31, 1997,\n\n      pertaining to the ProLogis site contained within the demolition area.\n\n             I now see that there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can\n\n      oversee this demolition project. In my opinion any further oversight by the Court would be\n\n      done without proper authority.\n\n             By this Court attempting to exceed it's [sic] authority and to go in and oversee the\n\n      entire environmental activities for the proposed demolitions would make this Court a\n\n      revolving door for the parties to constantly come in requesting the Court to evaluate and\n\n      review the various continuing steps and missteps which might occur in the demolition\n\n      process. This Court would be called upon to be a self-imposed 'environmental protection\n\n      agency' and/or risk assessment manager that would be constantly micromanaging the\n\n      demolition process and having numerous hearings with differing experts [sic] opinions on\n\n      what should and shouldn't be done at each step of the process.\n\n             That would leave the Court to impose its own judgment pertaining to environmental\n\n      issues where agencies and regulations already exist as an oversight.\n\n             As noted herein[,] there are guidelines as to what is appropriate and there are agencies\n\n      that can oversee same with their enforcement divisions as that of the EPA's.\n\n             In my opinion[,] I don't have a basis to impose any further guidelines. This Court\n\n      asked for a certain investigation to be done and in my opinion that investigation has been\n\n      successfully done. That investigation satisfied the basics of what this Court wanted to see\n\n\n\n                                              -39-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       from the Defendant before they [sic] started the process of demolition. I am now satisfied\n\n       by the fact that the environment protection and other agencies can continue to oversee this\n\n       project should there be violations of regulations, codes[,] or the like.\n\n               This Court has accomplished what it wanted to do when it issued the TRO and\n\n       Preliminary Injunction on a previous occasion and ordered the Defendant to do certain work\n\n       to ensure that the residents were protected from many concerns that might have existed\n\n       because of unregulated or uncontrolled activity by the City of Chicago in regards to\n\n       demolition.\n\n               It is appropriate for demolition to commence now under the standards laid out by the\n\n       expert testimony of the City of Chicago. Further delay creates inordinate safety issues\n\n       pertaining to the existence of vacant unoccupied structures as well as the resultant safety\n\n       issues within the approximate three hundred acres known as the Acquisition Area. That area\n\n       with all structures properly and safely removed eliminates the current eye sore condition and\n\n       eliminates the numerous concerns of fire, vandalism, and individual injuries to the public.\n\n               Based on the foregoing[,] there is a separate remedy with the enforcement divisions\n\n       of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require judicial\n\n       intervention.\" (Emphases in original and added.)\n\n       The trial court then made specific factual findings as to each of the prerequisites for a\n\npreliminary injunction. See Grandberg v. Didrickson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888-90 (1996) (stating\n\nprerequisites for a preliminary injunction). The court said:\n\n       \"1. Ascertainable Claim for Relief\n\n\n\n\n                                                -40-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n              Here, Plaintiffs claimed in their pleadings, in pertinent part, that they were entitled\n\n      to continuing injunctive relief because the City's planned demolition in the Acquisition Area\n\n      will endanger residents in Bensenville.\n\n              However, by the time of the July 7-10 hearing, the status quo as to residential\n\n      occupancy in the Acquisition Area had materially changed. *** [A]s the testimony\n\n      established, the number of residential occupied parcels has been reduced to only thirteen.\n\n      Moreover, as the evidence established, the planned demolition will be protective of all\n\n      remaining residents and Bensenville residents adjacent to the Acquisition Area.\n\n              Accordingly, the strength of Plaintiffs' ascertainable claims has been materially\n\n      diminished, a factor which the Court may take into account in deciding whether Plaintiffs are\n\n      entitled to continuing equitable relief.\n\n      2.Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n              ***.\n\n              A court may enjoin an anticipated nuisance only where it clearly appears that a\n\n      nuisance will necessarily result. [Citation.] ***\n\n              In this case, the Plaintiffs have not established that the City's planned demolition,\n\n      with the testing and controls to be put into place, constitutes a current, existing public\n\n      nuisance or that the public health will be endangered from demolition. Consequently,\n\n      Plaintiffs were required, but failed, to establish that there is a fair question that they have a\n\n      likelihood of success on the merits. I note this especially in light of the fact that the Plaintiffs\n\n      have not performed any independent testing or evaluative field studies of their own! They\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -41-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       have only taken issue with that performed by the Defendant. As such[,] the Plaintiff[s]\n\n       [have] not met their burden of proof for continuing injunctive relief.\n\n       3. Irreparable Harm\n\n              Plaintiffs have not established that they will be subject to irreparable harm as a result\n\n       of the demolition for much of the same reason that they have not established a fair question\n\n       of likelihood of success on the merits of their nuisance claim.\n\n              Plaintiffs have not established that they will be endangered by the City's planned\n\n       demolition. As discussed above, Plaintiffs' experts at most testified that there may be an\n\n       issue of concern or that they were uncertain or needed further data. However, these tentative\n\n       questions and concerns do not constitute actual harm. Moreover, as the evidence at the\n\n       hearing further established, not only will proper precautionary measures be taken during\n\n       demolition through the application of CRA's decommissioning and demolition controls ***\n\n       and air monitoring program *** to prevent any unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful\n\n       materials in the Acquisition Area, but Plaintiffs' claims that the Acquisition Area presents\n\n       significant uncontrollable risks to public health are simply without foundation.\n\n       4. No Adequate Remedy at Law\n\n              An additional element to be considered with regard to a decision as to whether\n\n       continuing injunctive relief should issue is whether Plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at\n\nlaw.\n\n              If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that the City's demolition will endanger\n\n       public health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But, as indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                                -42-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n      above, Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant the\n\n      continuing preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\n\n              A separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various federal and\n\n      state environmental protection agencies as created by the legislative bodies. There is no\n\n      further authority or basis for judicial intervention by this court.\n\n      5. Balancing the Hardships\n\n              The Court must also balance the hardships and the public interest in making its\n\n      determination regarding whether equitable injunctive relief should issue. *** Balancing the\n\n      hardships and the public interest clearly weigh in favor of terminating the preliminary\n\n      injunction. This determination is not made with an evaluation of necessity, which this Court\n\n      excluded from this hearing as that issue is currently pending in an eminent domain action\n\n      before Judge Culliton of the 18th Judicial Circuit. But the legislative history is relevant to\n\n      this determination.\n\n              The Illinois legislature has determined that the OMP is a project vital to the public\n\n      interest. ***\n\n              The evidence demonstrates that the demolition will occur in a manner protective of\n\n      public health. As previously referenced in this opinion, the prompt demolition of City-\n\n      owned buildings clearly outweighs Plaintiffs' unsubstantiated and admittedly uncertain\n\n      claims of harm concerning the planned demolition.\n\n              For all of these reasons, the balance of hardships weighs in favor of demolition in the\n\n      Acquisition Area, and the public interest amply supports proceeding with demolition as\n\n      planned by CRA on behalf of the City of Chicago.\" (Emphases in original and added.)\n\n\n\n                                               -43-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nThe court ordered that the demolition:\n\n       \"comply with all applicable state and federal environmental laws with respect to\n\n       decommissioning and demolition of the Acquisition Area buildings, and associated building\n\n       materials, equipment and contents, including but not limited to applicable provisions of the\n\n       Toxic Substances Control Act, and regulations thereunder, including 40 C.F.R. Part 761; the\n\n       Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and regulations thereunder, including 40 C.F.R.\n\n       Part 273; the Clean Air Act NESHAP for asbestos, 40 C.F.R. Part 61, and other federal and\n\n       state regulations pertaining to asbestos in the demolition context; federal and state law\n\n       pertaining to removal of underground storage tanks; and the Occupational Safety and Health\n\n       Act and regulations issued thereunder, including 29 C.F.R. 1926, Subpart T.\"\n\nThe court further directed Chicago to complete any further testing of structures or soils that it\n\n\"determines is necessary\" before beginning demolition in those areas.\n\n       On August 8, 2008, plaintiffs moved for a stay of the order lifting the injunction, pending\n\nappeal. The court refused to grant \"an indefinite stay\" but entered a stay until September 10. On\n\nAugust 14, plaintiffs appealed, under Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (188 Ill. 2d R. 307(a)(1)), the\n\norder lifting the injunction. Plaintiffs also appealed under Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (210 Ill. 2d\n\nR. 304(a)) the order dismissing counts I through IV of plaintiffs' complaint.\n\n       On August 18, plaintiffs moved this court for a stay of the August 7 order lifting the\n\ninjunction. We granted the motion and stayed the order pending further order of this court.\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n                               I. Dismissal of Counts I through IV\n\n\n\n\n                                               -44-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        We address first plaintiffs' challenge to the dismissal of counts I through IV of their second\n\namended complaint. Counts I and IV were dismissed under section 2--619 of the Code and counts\n\nII and III under section 2--615 of the Code.\n\n                                          A. Counts I and IV\n\n        \"A motion to dismiss under section 2--619(a)(9) admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint\n\nand raises defects, defenses, or other affirmative matters that appear on the face of the complaint or\n\nare established by external submissions and that act to defeat the plaintiff's claim.\" Board of\n\nTrustees of Community College District No. 502 v. Department of Professional Regulation, 363 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 190, 196 (2006). A dismissal under section 2--619 is generally reviewed de novo. Board\n\nof Trustees, 363 Ill. App. 3d at 196.\n\n        Count I seeks a declaration that: (1) the Act does not override the requirement of the Illinois\n\nConstitution \"that the courts *** decide after an evidentiary hearing whether any particular parcel\n\nis necessary\" for a public purpose; and (2) Chicago did not provide the requisite justification for\n\n\"taking\" properties in the Acquisition Area. Count I also asks that Chicago be ordered to restore \"to\n\ntheir prior state and condition\" the properties it \"acquired\" from the Acquisition Area and that\n\nChicago be enjoined from \"further acquisitions\"of property in Bensenville \"under any claim that the\n\nproperties are necessary\" for the OMP until Chicago proves its compliance with constitutional\n\nrequirements.\n\n        Before reviewing the trial court's grounds for dismissing count I under section 2--619, we\n\ntouch briefly on that part of count I in which plaintiffs seek a declaration that the Act does not trump\n\nthe constitutional restrictions on the taking of property. The trial court did not expressly rule on this\n\nrequest, but its remarks evince agreement with plaintiffs on the Act's relationship to the Illinois\n\n\n\n                                                  -45-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nConstitution. In its recitation of the applicable law, the trial court stated: \"If property is not\n\nnecessary for the public project, there is no constitutional authority to take the property--despite what\n\nthe Legislature has asserted in the authorizing statute.\" (Emphasis added.) This is a correct\n\nstatement of the law. Article I, section 15, of the Illinois Constitution, the takings clause, provides:\n\n\"Private property shall not be taken *** for public use without just compensation as provided by\n\nlaw.\" Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, §15. The takings clause \" 'is a restraint and limitation placed upon the\n\nexercise of [the condemnation power] as against the right of the private citizen except in those cases\n\nwhere public necessity requires the taking of private property for public use,' \" and \"[t]he legislature\n\n*** cannot, by delegating the power of eminent domain, dispense with constitutional requirements\n\nrestricting its use, including the requirement of 'necessity.' \" YWCA, 86 Ill. 2d at 232-33, quoting\n\nRyan, 357 Ill. at 154; see also Davis v.

In any event, plaintiffs complain of no error in the trial court's\n\ndisposition of their request for a declaration that the Act does not override constitutional\n\nrequirements. Rather, it seems their goal in pressing for that declaration was to clarify that, as they\n\nclaim in their brief, the Act does not prohibit them from \"proceed[ing] with adjudication of their\n\nallegations that Chicago's claims of constitutional necessity for hundreds of properties in Bensenville\n\n\n\n                                                  -46-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nare false and inaccurate.\" The trial court agreed, as do we, that the Act presents no such bar.\n\nWhether an obstacle in section 2--619 exists elsewhere is another matter.\n\n          In presenting its reasons for dismissing count I under section 2--619, the trial court\n\ndistinguished two groups of properties: (1) plaintiffs' own properties in the Acquisition Area,\n\ncurrently the subject of the eminent domain action before Judge Culliton; and (2) all other properties\n\nin the Acquisition Area. (The trial court assumed that all but plaintiffs' properties have been\n\nacquired by Chicago.) The trial court found these component claims barred by different affirmative\n\nmatter.\n\n          First, with respect to plaintiffs' own properties, the trial court determined that plaintiffs had\n\n\"an identical cause of action\" before Judge Culliton and could \"obtain complete relief\" in that\n\nproceeding. The court held, therefore, that this component of count I was barred under section\n\n2--619(a)(3) of the Code, which provides for dismissal where \"there is another action pending\n\nbetween the same parties for the same cause\" (735 ILCS 5/2--619(a)(3) (West 2006)).\n\n          \"Section 2--619(a)(3) furthers judicial economy by avoiding duplicative litigation.\"\n\nCombined Insurance Co. of America v.

First, the present proceeding and the proceeding before Judge\n\nCulliton are for the \"same cause.\" The matter before Judge Culliton is an eminent domain\n\nproceeding by which Chicago seeks to acquire plaintiffs' properties for the OMP. In that proceeding,\n\nplaintiffs contend that their properties are not necessary for either Phase 1 or Phase 2 of the OMP.\n\nPlaintiffs present the identical challenge here. The actions also involve the same parties. Plaintiffs\n\nare all parties to the suit before Judge Culliton and so their interests naturally are well represented\n\nthere.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -48-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Plaintiffs point out that \"none of the several hundred properties which Chicago has already\n\nacquired, which are the subject of this case, are involved in [Judge Culliton's case].\" (Emphasis\n\nadded.) This fact was fully grasped by the trial court, which found separate grounds (which we\n\nreview below) for granting the section 2--619 motion with respect to properties Chicago has already\n\nacquired.\n\n        Of course, as noted, the fulfillment of the \"same cause\" and \"same parties\" requirements does\n\nnot entail a reflexive dismissal but rather a look at the Hoch factors. Of the four Hoch factors, the\n\ntrial court gave special emphasis to the likelihood of relief in the Culliton proceeding. In seeking\n\nto upset the trial court's decision, plaintiffs offer surprisingly little argument on the Hoch factors.\n\nThey certainly do not convince us that the factors weigh so heavily against dismissal that the trial\n\ncourt's decision was arbitrary, fanciful, or irrational. Plaintiffs' only contention is that \"none of the\n\nequitable relief sought here is involved in [Judge Culliton's case].\" Presumably, plaintiffs mean the\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief they seek here, but they do not present any explanation or develop\n\nany argument regarding the noninvolvement of this relief in the case before Judge Culliton. We will\n\nnot make their case for them. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing,\n\nunder section 2--619(a)(3) of the Code, plaintiffs' request for a declaration that their properties are\n\nnot necessary for the OMP.\n\n        Turning to the trial court's grounds for dismissing count I as it relates to properties other than\n\nplaintiffs', we note that the trial court appeared to misconstrue count I, though not in a way fatal to\n\nits analysis. The trial court assumed that all of the property owners other than plaintiffs \"contracted\"\n\nwith Chicago \"for the sale of [their] properties.\" The source of this assumption is unclear to us.\n\nCount I alleges that Chicago acquired properties \"either through eminent domain proceedings or the\n\n\n\n                                                  -49-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthreat of eminent domain.\" (Emphases added.) Count II alleges that \"many--indeed hundreds of\n\nproperty owners--sold their homes to Chicago under threat of eminent domain in reliance on the truth\n\nof Chicago's false statements as to necessity to take their properties.\" (Emphasis added.) Yet count\n\nII also references condemnation proceedings involving some of the properties.\n\n       A distinction may possibly lie here. The complaint does not expound the phrase \"threat of\n\neminent domain,\" but, generally, a \"taking\" for constitutional purposes requires at least the formal\n\ninitiation of condemnation proceedings.

In La Salle National Bank, two school boards sought\n\nto sell land they acquired in separate eminent domain proceedings but later decided not to use for\n\nthe purpose for which it was condemned, i.e., as sites for schools. The plaintiffs, banks that held the\n\nproperties as trustees at the time they were condemned, filed suit to stop the sales, alleging that they\n\nretained a reversionary interest in the properties that was triggered when the school boards decided\n\nnot to use them for school purposes. The supreme court held that the plaintiffs' claims were barred\n\nunder the doctrine of res judicata:\n\n       \"[Plaintiffs] had the opportunity to contend in the eminent domain action that the school\n\n       authorities would take less than a fee simple estate but did not do so.

The judgments are not now subject to collateral attack.\n\n        [Plaintiffs] cannot litigate the question they could have had decided in the original\n\n        proceedings.\" La Salle National Bank, 61 Ill. 2d at 530-31.\n\nLikewise here, plaintiffs, assuming arguendo that they possessed an interest to litigate in the\n\ncondemnation proceedings, cannot revisit the grounds for those prior judgments.\n\n        Counsel for plaintiffs intimated at oral argument that a constitutional violation may consist\n\nof the very demolition of properties for which the condemning authority has shown no necessity.\n\nCounsel's insinuation was that, if plaintiffs have no standing to challenge the acquisition of\n\nproperties other than their own, they have standing at least to seek the imposition of a constructive\n\ntrust on those properties in order to forestall what plaintiffs deem an unconstitutional demolition.\n\nAt least in count I, however, plaintiffs allege no illegality of the proposed demolition apart from the\n\nwrongful taking of the properties. As we have shown, plaintiffs either lack standing to challenge the\n\ncondemnation of properties other than their own or are barred from collaterally attacking those\n\ncondemnation judgments. For the foregoing reasons, we find no error in the trial court's dismissal\n\nof count I.\n\n        Count IV, which was also dismissed under section 2--619, sought a declaratory judgment that\n\nthe Demolition Ordinance governs demolition of properties in the Acquisition Area. The trial court\n\ndismissed count IV on the ground that the Act preempts the Demolition Ordinance. \"Determination\n\nof preemption of a local ordinance by a state statute involves construction of the statute and is\n\nsubject to de novo review.\" City of Champaign v.

First, they contend that \"airport\n\nproperty\" is property legally acquired by Chicago for O'Hare, and, because this very lawsuit\n\nchallenges the legality of Chicago's acquisition of properties in Bensenville, those properties are not\n\n\"airport property.\" The issue, however, is which legal norms govern the acquisition of property. The\n\nAct does not attempt to override constitutional restrictions on Chicago's acquisition of property.\n\n(Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges fail on other grounds, as noted above.) The Act does, however,\n\nunequivocally override local restrictions on the acquisition of property pursuant to the OMP. Section\n\n30 of the Act (620 ILCS 65/30 (West 2006)) states:\n\n                 \"It is declared to be the law of this State *** that the regulation and supervision of\n\n       the City of Chicago's implementation of the [OMP] is an exclusive State function that may\n\n       not be exercised concurrently by any unit of local government.\"\n\n\"Implementation\" we take to encompass all stages of the OMP from property acquisition, to\n\ndemolition, to construction. The Demolition Ordinance, being the creature of a locality, is\n\npreempted by the Act to the extent that it attempts to regulate any stage in the implementation of the\n\nOMP.\n\n\n\n       11\n            There is no question that Chicago has not authorized regulation by any other local\n\ngovernment.\n\n                                                  -56-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n        Given the foregoing, we can dispense in short order with plaintiffs' second point, which is\n\nthat the Demolition Ordinance is a public safety measure akin to the police and fire protection that\n\nBensenville continues to provide in the Acquisition Area at Chicago's insistence. Plaintiffs wonder\n\n\"how Bensenville can enforce police, fire, and other public safety laws in the Acquisition Area while\n\nbeing barred from enforcing its public safety and health[-]based demolition ordinance.\" But the\n\nissue, as Chicago notes, is whether Bensenville's police and fire protection and other public safety\n\nservices \"constitute attempted regulation of the OMP.\" Plaintiffs' argument is undercut by the very\n\ncases they cite, both of which judge a county's obligation to comply with city ordinances by whether\n\nthe ordinances conflict with the statutory program carried out by the county.

(West 1998)) against Boise Cascade,\n\nthe manufacturer of siding that was installed on the plaintiffs' homes when they were built. The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the siding deteriorated prematurely and that Boise Cascade made false\n\n\n\n                                                 -59-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nrepresentations about the durability of the siding in its product literature. The supreme court\n\naffirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for Boise Cascade. The court held that\n\n\"deceptive advertising cannot be the proximate cause of damages under the [Consumer Fraud] Act\n\nunless it actually deceives the plaintiff\" and that the plaintiffs' complaint was deficient for failing to\n\nallege such \"actual deception.\" Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 525. The court caveated that the deception\n\nneed not \"always be direct between the defendant and the plaintiff\" to satisfy the Consumer Fraud\n\nAct. Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 526. That is, the complaint would have been sufficient if the plaintiffs\n\nhad alleged that the literature for the siding deceived a builder, architect, or contractor resulting in\n\ninstallation of the siding on the plaintiffs' homes. \"In those circumstances, the purchaser, who may\n\nhave no independent knowledge of the qualities or expected performance standards of siding, is\n\ndeceived because of the deception of the builder, architect or contractor, who reasonably should have\n\nhad correct knowledge.\" Shannon, 208 Ill. 2d at 526.

The court held that there was sufficient evidence of reliance because the hospital could be\n\nsaid to have been deceived through the manufacturer's deception of the architect and the builder. St.\n\nJoseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d at 956. The court explained that privity \"in the traditional sense\" does not\n\napply in fraud cases. St. Joseph, 21 Ill. App. 3d at 954. \"It is enough,\" the court explained, \"that the\n\nstatements by the defendant be made with the intention that it reach the plaintiff and influence his\n\naction and that it does reach him and that he does rely upon it, to his damage.\" St. Joseph, 21 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d at 954. The court cited legal commentary for support. See St. Joseph, 21 Ill.

The court found a more apt standard in section 311 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,\n\nentitled \"Negligent Misrepresentation Involving Risk of Physical Harm.\" Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts §311 (1965). Section 311 declares:\n\n                \"(1) One who negligently gives false information to another is subject to liability for\n\n        physical harm caused by action taken by the other in reasonable reliance upon such\n\n        information, where such harm results\n\n                        (a) to the other, or\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -62-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                          (b) to such third persons as the actor should expect to be put in peril by the\n\n                   action taken.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts §311, at 106 (1965).\n\nThe court observed that section 311 creates \"broader liability\" than section 552 of the Restatement,\n\nentitled \"Information Negligently Supplied for the Guidance of Others,\" which requires, in part, that\n\nthe defendant make the representations \"in the course of his business.\" Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts §552, at 126 (1965).12\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that, in adopting section 311, the supreme court in A, C & S implicitly\n\nadopted its companion provision, section 310, which is entitled \"Conscious Misrepresentation\n\nInvolving Risk of Physical Harm\" and concerns fraudulent rather than negligent misrepresentations.\n\nSection 310 provides:\n\n                   \"An actor who makes a misrepresentation is subject to liability to another for physical\n\n        harm which results from an act done by the other or a third person in reliance upon the truth\n\n        of the representation, if the actor\n\n\n\n        12\n             Section 311 is broader also because, as we explain below, it permits recovery for parties\n\nwho did not themselves rely on the alleged misrepresentations but were damaged by those who did.\n\nThe supreme court in A, C & S did not, however, apply this feature of section 311. In remanding\n\nthe case, the court noted that the plaintiffs' allegations were \"very broad and unspecific\" and that they\n\nwould need to prove at trial \"what representations were made to them and who made [the]\n\nrepresentations.\" (Emphasis added.) A, C & S, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 456. Apparently, the plaintiffs alleged\n\ntheir own reliance, not that of others. Thus, the court relied on section 311 not for its expansive\n\nconcept of reliance but for its lack of a requirement that the defendant have made the\n\nmisrepresentation in the course of its business.\n\n                                                    -63-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                        (a) intends his statement to induce or should realize that it is likely to induce\n\n                action by the other, or a third person, which involves an unreasonable risk of physical\n\n                harm to the other, and\n\n                        (b) knows\n\n                                (I) that the statement is false, or\n\n                                (ii) that he has not the knowledge he professes.\" Restatement\n\n                        (Second) of Torts §310, at 103 (1965).\n\nSection 310 imposes liability on the defendant for physical harm to another \"which results from an\n\nact done by the other or a third person in reliance\" upon a conscious misrepresentation made by the\n\ndefendant. (Emphasis added.) Restatement (Second) of Torts §310, at 103 (1965). Likewise,\n\nsection 311 imposes liability where the defendant makes a negligent misrepresentation to another\n\nand the other's reliance causes physical harm to \"third persons.\" Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n§311, at 106 (1965). Thus, sections 310 and 311 both permit recovery for parties who did not\n\nthemselves rely on the alleged misrepresentation but were damaged by those who did so rely.\n\nNeither section is applicable here, however, because each presupposes physical harm and plaintiffs\n\nhave not alleged that they incurred such harm.\n\n        Because plaintiffs have not alleged that they themselves relied on the misrepresentations for\n\nwhich they seek recovery, and because they do not claim physical harm, they have not adequately\n\npleaded the element of reliance. The trial court, therefore, did not err in dismissing count II. In light\n\nof this holding, we do not review Chicago's other proposed bases for affirming the dismissal.\n\n        Count III of plaintiffs' second amended complaint alleges unjust enrichment. Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat \"Chicago has improperly and unjustly obtained and continue[s] to retain the use of the properties\n\n\n\n                                                  -64-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nin the Acquisition Area by violating the necessity limits of the Illinois Constitution and by false\n\nstatements as to necessity.\" The trial court dismissed count III because: (1) the properties \"are not\n\nfor the benefit of the City of Chicago,\" that is, there is no indication that Chicago \"intends to use the\n\nacquired properties for anything other than expansion of O'Hare\"; and (2) Chicago acquired the\n\nproperties through real estate contracts, and, therefore, unjust enrichment, a quasi-contractual\n\nremedy, is not available.\n\n        Chicago reiterates here an argument that it presented below but that drew no comment from\n\nthe trial court. Nonetheless, the argument may serve as a basis for affirmance. See Paul H.\n\nSchwendener, Inc., 358 Ill. App. 3d at 71. Chicago notes that count III deals strictly with Chicago's\n\nacquisition of properties other than plaintiffs'. Count III is deficient, Chicago suggests, because it\n\ndoes not allege that Chicago accepted any benefit from plaintiffs. This does not quite identify the\n\ntrue problem with count III. It is not itself fatal to count III that plaintiffs are complaining about what\n\nChicago acquired from others. \"To state a cause of action based on a theory of unjust enrichment,\n\na plaintiff must allege that the defendant has unjustly retained a benefit to the plaintiff's detriment,\n\nand that defendant's retention of the benefit violates the fundamental principles of justice, equity, and\n\ngood conscience.\" HPI Health Care Services, Inc. v.

To obtain a preliminary injunction, the movant\n\nmust establish:\n\n                  \"(1) that he or she possesses a clearly ascertainable right which needs protection; (2)\n\n        that he or she would suffer irreparable harm without the injunction; (3) there is no adequate\n\n        remedy at law for his [or her] injury; (4) there is a likelihood of success on the merits; and\n\n        (5) the plaintiff will suffer more harm without the injunction than the defendant will suffer\n\n        with it. ***\n\n\n\n                                                   -66-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n                                                  ***\n\n                  *** In balancing these equities, the court should also consider the effect of the\n\n        injunction on the public.\" Grandberg, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 888-90.\n\n\"The decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction lies within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt and on review the decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.\" Klaeren, 202\n\nIll. 2d at 177.\n\n        Plaintiffs claim that the trial court abused its discretion by \"abdicat[ing] *** its common law\n\npublic nuisance jurisdiction in favor of non-existent administrative agency protection.\" Plaintiffs\n\nassert that the trial court erroneously assumed that \"the judiciary either did not have independent\n\nnuisance jurisdiction, or that the trial court should somehow defer to the administrative agencies.\"\n\nPlaintiffs claim that these misapprehensions are evident in several of the trial court's remarks. For\n\nexample, in the prefatory findings in its written order, the trial court led with this statement:\n\n        \"I now see that there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can oversee\n\n        this demolition project. In my opinion any further oversight by the Court would be done\n\n        without proper authority.\"\n\nThe trial court determined that the \"enforcement division[s]\" of these \"agencies\" are adequate to\n\nredress \"violations of regulations, codes[,] or the like.\" The trial court found it \"appropriate for\n\ndemolition to commence now under the standards laid out by the expert testimony of the City of\n\nChicago\" and that the court \"[did not] have a basis to impose any further guidelines.\" The trial court\n\nconcluded its general findings by stating that \"there is a separate remedy with the enforcement\n\ndivisions of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require judicial\n\nintervention.\"\n\n\n\n                                                  -67-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       As plaintiffs note, these thoughts surfaced again in the trial court's specific findings. In\n\nconsidering whether plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law, the court determined:\n\n               \"If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that [Chicago's] demolition will\n\n       endanger the public health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But,\n\n       as indicated above, Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant\n\n       the continuing preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\n\n               A separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various federal and\n\n       state environmental protection agencies as created by legislative bodies. There is no further\n\n       authority or basis for judicial intervention by this court.\"\n\n       We agree with plaintiffs that the trial court's remarks are questionable on several levels.\n\nFirst, they are not consistent. At one point, the court claims that these \"agencies\" (unnamed but for\n\nthe \"EPA\") can \"oversee\" the demolition, which suggests active supervision. At another point, the\n\ncourt remarks that the agencies are available for redressing violations of regulations and codes,\n\nwhich implies not ongoing or active oversight but rather intervention as needed. Second, there is\n\nscant evidentiary ground for finding any administrative agency available to oversee the demolition\n\nin a manner active and thorough enough to prevent a public nuisance and so to serve as an adequate\n\nalternative to the equitable relief sought by plaintiffs, namely, a prospective injunction. The\n\ntestimony at the July 2008 hearing contains but two allusions to potential agency involvement. The\n\nfirst is the October 31, 1997, \"No Further Remediation\" in which the IEPA implies that further soil\n\ndisturbance at the Nelson Wire/Pro Logis site will lead to action by the IEPA, and the second is\n\nBlickle's testimony that the USEPA and IEPA both must be informed of the presence of RACM in\n\n\n\n\n                                                -68-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nthe Acquisition Area. These two points of evidence do not establish potential agency involvement\n\nnearly on the scale the court conceived.\n\n       Following oral argument, Chicago filed a motion to cite statutes and regulations that vest the\n\nIEPA and the USEPA with power to enforce environmental laws and regulations. Chicago notes,\n\nfor instance, that the Illinois Environmental Protection Act (Environmental Protection Act) (415\n\nILCS 5/31(d)(1) (West 2006)) provides that \"[a]ny person may file with the [Illinois Pollution\n\nControl] Board a complaint *** against any person allegedly violating this Act, any rule or\n\nregulation adopted under [this] Act, any permit or term or condition of a permit, or any Board order.\"\n\nThe Environmental Protection Act also permits the State to file enforcement actions in the circuit\n\ncourts. See generally 415 ILCS 5/42, 43, 44 (West 2006). We grant this motion, but note that these\n\nvarious authorities do not persuade us that the trial court acted correctly. Agency authority does not\n\ndisplace the judiciary's equitable powers in these circumstances.\n\n       Such is the lesson of Village of Wilsonville v.

The court agreed\n\nwith the trial and appellate courts that \"a prospective nuisance is a fit candidate for injunctive relief.\"\n\n(Emphasis in original.) Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 25. The court held that \"the defendant is engaged\n\nin an extremely hazardous undertaking at an unsuitable location, which seriously and imminently\n\nposes a threat to the public health.\" Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 30. The court rejected the defendant's\n\ncontention that the plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law because they could have pursued relief\n\nthrough administrative channels:\n\n                \"We *** disagree with the defendant that since the plaintiffs could seek review from\n\n        the IEPA's decision to grant permits to the defendants through the Pollution Control Board\n\n        they have an adequate remedy at law and are unable to obtain relief in a court of equity.\n\n        First, the plaintiffs are not seeking a review of the issuance of permits. The plaintiffs [are\n\n        seeking] to enjoin a nuisance, a matter which is properly brought in a court of equity. This\n\n        court has stated that jurisdiction exists in the circuit court 'to abate public nuisances which\n\n        may endanger the general welfare.' [Citation.] Thus, the trial court has subject matter\n\n        jurisdiction to decide the issues raised herein, and to award appropriate equitable relief.\"\n\n        Wilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 27-28.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   -71-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       From Wilsonville we see the error in the trial court's reasoning behind its termination of the\n\npreliminary injunction. Like Wilsonville, this case is an \"environmental matter[]\" (Wilsonville, 77\n\nIll. App. 3d at 625) in which a proposed activity is claimed to threaten a public nuisance in the form\n\nof release of hazardous substances into residential areas. Jurisdiction is no less certain here than in\n\nWilsonville. Having jurisdiction, the trial court had a responsibility to determine, under all relevant\n\nfactors, and without regard to the concurrent jurisdiction of administrative agencies, whether\n\ndemolition would constitute a public nuisance. The court, however, displayed an overt reliance on\n\nthe powers of administrative agencies in determining whether plaintiffs have an adequate remedy\n\nat law. The court found that \"a separate remedy does exist with the enforcement divisions of various\n\nfederal and state environmental protection agencies as created by the legislative bodies.\" This\n\nreliance was misplaced for two reasons. First, it was wrong from an evidentiary point of view\n\nbecause, as noted, the record contains virtually no evidence of any potential agency involvement.\n\nSee Liebert Corp. v. Mazur, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092015\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092015/liebert-corp-v-mazur/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Second, it was wrong from an institutional view--that is, as\n\na matter of law--because, as Wilsonville teaches, the court had no cause to abdicate its judicial\n\nfunction even if a remedy could be found in administrative bodies. See Engel v. Loyfman, 383 Ill.\n\nApp. 3d 191, 197 (2008) (a trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is based on a\n\n\"misapprehension of law\"). In Wilsonville, the supreme court rejected the defendant's argument that\n\nthe plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law because they could have pursued administrative review\n\nof the IEPA's decision to license the defendant's landfill. The supreme court reasoned that the\n\nplaintiffs were seeking \"to enjoin a nuisance, a matter which is properly brought in a court of equity.\"\n\n\n\n                                                 -72-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\nWilsonville, 86 Ill. 2d at 27. In Wilsonville, there at least was an identifiable remedy available\n\nthrough administrative channels. Here, by contrast, there was no evidence of any available remedy,\n\nmuch less one comparable to the injunction sought. The trial court, we conclude, abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law.\n\n        We recognize, of course, that the trial court's discussion of the \"adequate remedy at law\"\n\nfactor appears at first blush to have alternative rationales. Immediately preceding the reference to\n\nadministrative agencies, the court stated:\n\n        \"If Plaintiffs had established their allegations that the City's demolition will endanger public\n\n        health, the Plaintiffs would likely have no adequate remedy at law. But, as indicated above,\n\n        Plaintiffs have failed to do so, and consequently, the Court cannot grant the continuing\n\n        preliminary injunctive relief which Plaintiffs seek.\"\n\nIn actuality, this was not a finding that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law but rather an\n\nexplanation for not reaching the issue in light of the court's findings on other factors. In that respect,\n\nit does not jibe with the court's immediately following remark about the availability of remedies from\n\nadministrative agencies.\n\n        We also recognize that plaintiffs were obligated to satisfy all prerequisites for a preliminary\n\ninjunction. In theory, then, our disagreement with the trial court's finding that plaintiffs have an\n\nadequate remedy at law would pose no barrier to affirmance should we determine that plaintiffs\n\nfailed to meet one or more of the other prerequisites. We decline to take that avenue, since it is clear\n\nthat the trial court's entire analysis was influenced by its factually unfounded and legally erroneous\n\nview of the potential role of administrative agencies in the demolition. Although the trial court's\n\nerroneous perspective does not overtly surface in its discussion of the remaining findings, the general\n\n\n\n                                                  -73-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\ndiscussion that precedes its specific findings is pervaded with a sentiment that the court had no place\n\nadjudicating matters on which administrative agencies may act. No fewer than five times does the\n\ncourt mention \"administrative agencies\" and their \"enforcement divisions.\" In fact, the court's\n\ndiscussion is bookended by two of these references. At the outset of its remarks, before even hinting\n\nat its own assessment of the alleged hazards in the proposed demolition, the court mentions that\n\n\"there are sufficient governmental agencies and regulations that can oversee this demolition project\"\n\nand that \"further oversight by the Court would be done without proper authority.\" The court\n\nconcludes its remarks by stating: \"Based on the foregoing[,] there is a separate remedy with the\n\nenforcement divisions of the various environmental protection agencies that would not require\n\njudicial intervention.\" This is revealing, for, though the availability of another remedy is but one of\n\nmultiple considerations in weighing the propriety of injunctive relief, the court gives it exclusive\n\nattention here. Tellingly, the court's discussion ends not with an assertion of its own jurisdiction but\n\nwith an attitude of deference.\n\n       A further sign that the trial court's entire analysis was influenced by its notion of agency\n\ninvolvement is its failure to resolve the core conflicts in the testimony at the hearing. We have\n\nexhaustively set forth the evidence and find it teeming with polarized expert opinions on highly\n\ntechnical matters such as soil sampling, soil screening levels, emission factors, and demolition\n\ncontrols. The trial court made some reference to this testimony but its analysis shows no weighting\n\nof these radically opposed views. There is instead this summary finding:\n\n       \"[N]ot only will proper precautionary measures be taken during demolition through the\n\n       application of CRA's decommissioning and demolition controls *** and air monitoring\n\n       program *** to prevent any unsafe exposure to any potentially harmful materials in the\n\n\n\n                                                 -74-\n\fNo. 2--08--0769\n\n\n       Acquisition Area, but Plaintiffs' claims that the Acquisition Area presents significant\n\n       uncontrollable risks to public health are simply without foundation.\"\n\nSection 11--101 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/11–101 (West 2006)) provides that every order granting\n\nor denying an injunction \"shall set forth the reasons for its entry.\" Section 11--101 requires reasons\n\nclear and detailed enough to apprize the reviewing court of the basis for the decision.
