PHA hires Zachry to construct a wharf and understands Zachry plans\n         to use a freeze-wall means and methods. ..................................................... 1\n\nII.      The Contract makes Zachry solely responsible for choosing the means\n         and methods of construction and precludes PHA control. ........................... 4\n\nIII.     PHA belatedly adds an extension to the wharf design and recognizes\n         only Zachry can timely build it and only with the frozen-cutoff wall. ........ 5\n\nIV.      PHA conceals its unsubstantiated “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff\n         wall to induce Zachry into agreeing to build the extension. ........................ 8\n\nV.       PHA waits to reject the frozen-cutoff wall until after Zachry is bound\n         by CO4, which plainly incorporates the frozen-cutoff wall. ...................... 11\nVI.      PHA issues its R&R Order, which everyone understands rejected the\n         frozen-cutoff wall and which Zachry makes clear to PHA constitutes a\n         breach. ......................................................................................................... 15\n\nVII. PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall forces Zachry to complete\n     construction in the wet. ............................................................................... 16\n\nVIII. Working in the wet causes Zachry substantial damages for which it\n      sues.............................................................................................................. 21\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ............................................................................ 24\nARGUMENT ........................................................................................................ 26\n\n\n                                                              iv\n\fI.    Ample evidence supports the jury’s breach-of-contract findings. ............. 26\n\n      A.       Section 5.10 prohibited PHA’s R&R Order, and no other\n               Contract provision authorized it. ...................................................... 26\n\n               1.        Section 5.10 forbids PHA control of Zachry’s means and\n                         methods. ................................................................................. 26\n               2.        Section 4.07 forbids PHA control over Zachry’s health-\n                         and-safety plans...................................................................... 28\n\n               3.        None of PHA’s other cited provisions authorize the R&R\n                         Order. ..................................................................................... 29\n\n               4.        PHA is not remediless. ........................................................... 32\n\n               5.        The drilled-shaft submittal is consistent with Zachry’s\n                         reading. ................................................................................... 32\n\n      B.       PHA’s R&R Order breached CO4. .................................................. 33\n      C.       Question 1 was proper. ..................................................................... 35\n\nII.   The jury's verdict on causation and damages is supported by the\n      evidence. ..................................................................................................... 35\n\n      A.       Draper’s assumptions on damages were supported by the\n               evidence and did not vary materially from undisputed facts. .......... 36\n               1.        Draper’s treatment of freeze-pipe removal was supported\n                         by the evidence....................................................................... 37\n\n               2.        Draper’s treatment of sheet-pile installation was\n                         supported by the evidence...................................................... 39\n\n      B.       The evidence establishes causation. ................................................. 40\n\n               1.        Ample evidence supported the jury’s causation finding........ 40\n\n               2.        PHA’s “Contract completion deadline” argument fails......... 41\n\n               3.        PHA’s “alternative cause” argument fails. ............................ 42\n      C.       PHA’s lack-of-authority argument does not defeat causation. ........ 43\n\n                                                          v\n\fIII.   Sections 5.41 and 5.42 do not bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim. ...... 45\n\n       A.      The “changes” clauses are inapplicable by their terms. ................... 45\n\n       B.      Alternatively, common-law and statutory rules preclude\n               application of the “changes” clauses here. ....................................... 48\n\n               1.       The Shintech doctrine. ........................................................... 48\n                        a.       Green does not preclude application of Shintech. ....... 49\n                        b.       Technip does not preclude application of Shintech. .... 50\n\n               2.       The radical-change doctrine................................................... 51\n               3.       Section §16.071...................................................................... 52\n\n       C.      The “changes” clauses were not tried. ............................................. 53\n\n       D.      If the trial court erred, remand—not rendition—is required............ 54\n\n       E.      Zachry’s failure to seek a §5.08 extension was irrelevant. .............. 54\n\nIV.    The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding PHA’s $8.6\n       million in alleged harms claimed as offsets. .............................................. 55\n\nV.     PHA’s “open-the-door” theory did not support admission of PHA’s\n       alleged harms regarding the no-damages-for-delay exceptions. ................ 58\n\n       A.      The trial court properly excluded PHA’s actual-harms evidence\n               under Rule 403. ................................................................................ 58\n       B.      Any error was harmless. ................................................................... 60\n\nVI.    The trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to fraud. ..................... 60\n       A.      The Supreme Court approved the recklessness instruction. ............ 60\n\n       B.      No charge error tainted the no-damages-for-delay exceptions. ....... 61\n\nVII. The apparent-authority instructions were proper. ...................................... 62\n\n       A.      Apparent authority is a fact issue. .................................................... 62\n\n       B.      Zachry pleaded apparent authority. .................................................. 63\n\n                                                       vi\n\fVIII. PHA is not entitled to attorneys’ fees if Zachry prevails on any theory. ... 64\n\nIX.      Zachry’s recovery on its pass-through claim should be affirmed. ............. 67\n\n         A.        Zachry asserts a valid pass-through claim. ...................................... 67\n\n         B.        The Court correctly charged the jury on pass-through. ................... 70\n\n         C.

Mike Engelhart, 151st Judicial District, Harris County.\n\nJury Verdict:        The jury found PHA breached both §5.10 of the Bayport\n                     Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n                     (“the Contract”) and Change Order 4 thereto. CR59:17390-\n                     91(A4).1 The jury further (1) awarded Zachry $18,602,697 in\n                     damages, CR59:17392-93(A4);2 (2) found that PHA’s breach\n                     was not excused by waiver, equitable estoppel, quasi-estoppel,\n                     release, or fraudulent inducement, CR59:17396-99(A4);\n                     (3) found that PHA did not fail to comply with the Contract by\n                     withholding $600,000 for dredging from PHA’s payment on\n                     amounts invoiced by Zachry, CR59:17402(A4); (4) with\n                     respect to the trial court’s determination that PHA failed to\n                     comply with the Contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36\n                     million that PHA withheld as liquidated damages, found\n                     (a) PHA’s breach was excused to the extent of $970,000 that\n                     PHA withheld from payments to Zachry for allegedly defective\n                     fenders, and (b) PHA’s breach was not excused based on\n                     release, CR59:17405-06(A4); and (5) found the reasonable fees\n                     for the necessary services of PHA’s attorneys totaled\n                     $10,697,750 for all stages of litigation and breach of contract\n                     theories, CR59:17407-08(A4).\n\nJudgment:            Judge Engelhart rendered judgment on the verdict, awarding\n\n1\n  Abbreviations in this brief are the same as in Zachry’s previously filed briefs in this case.\n“PHASupp.” refers to PHA’s Post-Remand Supplemental Brief of Appellant.\n2\n The jury found 58.13% of these damages to be delay damages, CR59:17394(A4), but the trial\ncourt entered an agreed order disregarding the jury’s answer, finding that 100% of those\ndamages were conclusively established to have been delay damages, CR60:17526.\n\n                                             xiv\n\f                 Zachry $19,992,697 in damages, which the court calculated by\n                 adding the $2.36 million in improperly withheld liquidated\n                 damages the court awarded Zachry on directed verdict plus the\n                 $18,602,697 jury award for a total of $20,962,697, and then\n                 deducting the $970,000 offset found by the jury.\n                 CR62:18166(A1). The court declined to award Zachry the\n                 $600,000 that Zachry claimed PHA wrongfully withheld from\n                 Zachry’s payments but that the jury had declined to award to\n                 Zachry. Id. The court also declined to award PHA attorneys’\n                 fees. CR62:18163-67(A1). The court awarded pre- and post-\n                 judgment interest and taxable costs. CR62:18166-67(A1).\n\nCourt of\nAppeals:         PHA appealed, and Zachry cross-appealed. CR64:18706-11;\n                 CR64:18925-27. A panel of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals\n                 consisting of Justices McCally, Christopher, and Boyce heard\n                 oral argument. In an opinion authored by Justice McCally, the\n                 Panel reversed and rendered judgment against Zachry, holding\n                 that (1) the no-damages-for-delay provision in §5.07 of the\n                 Contract precluded Zachry’s damages as a matter of\n                 law, (2) Zachry unambiguously released its claims for\n                 liquidated damages and for $600,000 withheld for dredging\n                 (Christopher, J., dissenting), (3) the trial court did not err in\n                 offsetting the judgment against PHA by $970,000 for allegedly\n                 defective wharf fenders, and (4) PHA should recover its\n                 attorneys’ fees from Zachry. The Port of Houston Authority of\n                 Harris County v. Zachry Construction Corporation, 377\n                 S.W.3d 841 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012), rev’d,\n                 449 S.W.3d 98 (Tex. 2014)(A2).\n\nSupreme Court: In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Fourteenth\n               Court’s judgment. Zachry Construction Corporation v. Port of\n               Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98, 119-20\n               (Tex. 2014)(A3). In an opinion authored by Justice Hecht, the\n               majority held that Zachry’s claim for delay damages was not\n               barred by governmental immunity or by the no-damages-for-\n               delay provision of the Contract. It also held that Zachry was\n               entitled to recover liquidated damages withheld by PHA, but\n               that there was some evidence to support the jury’s award of the\n               $970,000 offset for allegedly defective wharf fenders. Finally,\n                                      xv\n\fit concluded that PHA was not entitled to attorneys’ fees.\nBecause PHA had raised a number of other issues, the Supreme\nCourt remanded the case to the Fourteenth Court for further\nconsideration. Id. at 120(A3).\n\n\n\n\n                   xvi\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    Breach of §5.10. The jury’s finding in Question 1 that PHA failed to\n\ncomply with §5.10 of the Contract is supported by factually and legally sufficient\n\nevidence, because, inter alia,\n\n      (a)    §5.10 provided PHA had no “right to control” Zachry's means and\n\n             methods,\n\n      (b)    no other provision of the Contract gave PHA such a right of control,\n\n             and\n\n      (c)    the evidence established that PHA exercised control over Zachry’s\n\n             means and methods by issuing a revise-and-resubmit order (“R&R\n\n             Order”) in response to Zachry's frozen-cutoff wall design.        See\n\n             Argument Part I.A.\n\n2.    Breach of CO4. The jury’s finding that PHA failed to comply with Change\n\nOrder 4 (“CO4”) is supported by factually and legally sufficient evidence, because,\n\ninter alia, PHA only challenges Zachry's interpretation of the change order—not\n\nwhether PHA failed to comply with it—and the evidence established that PHA\n\nagreed in CO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall embodied in the\n\nSeptember 9 design, thereby obviating any purported right PHA had to issue the\n\nR&R Order. See Argument Part I.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xvii\n\f3.    Instruction in Question 1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ninstructing the jury in Question 1 that it was “not being asked to decide whether\n\nPHA failed to comply with §5.10.” See Argument Part I.C.\n\n      (a)   The instruction properly clarified that the jury was being asked to\n\n            decide in Question 1 whether CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the\n\n            frozen-cutoff wall embodied in the Sept. 9 design, and if so, whether\n\n            PHA failed to comply with such a right, as distinguished from the\n\n            question whether PHA complied with §5.10, which the jury\n\n            considered in Question No. 2. See Argument Part I.C.\n\n      (b)   PHA has not shown and cannot show reversible error, because the\n\n            jury found in Question 2 that PHA failed to comply with §5.10;\n\n            Zachry was entitled to a directed verdict on its claim for breach of\n\n            CO4, and Question 1 should not have been submitted; and PHA has\n\n            not otherwise shown harm. See Argument Part I.C.\n\n4.    Damages. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\n\njury's finding of damages in Question 3. See Argument Part II.A. And the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude Draper’s testimony. See\n\nArgument Part II.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                      xviii\n\f5.     Causation. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\n\njury’s finding that PHA’s failure to comply with §5.10 and/or CO4 caused\n\nZachry’s damages. See Argument Part II.B.\n\n       (a)   Zachry offered sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of\n\n             causation, and expert testimony was not required. See Argument Part\n\n             II.B.\n\n       (b)   PHA waived its argument that Zachry was required to prove that,\n\n             absent PHA’s breach, it would have completed all of Milestone-A in\n\n             the dry before either February 15 or May 15, 2006. See Argument\n\n             Part II.B.\n\n       (c)   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in charging the jury as to\n\n             apparent authority, and PHA shows no harm. See Argument Part II.C.\n\n6.     Sections 5.41/5.42. The trial court did not err in holding that §§5.41/5.42\n\n(and §5.52 to the extent it imposes the same requirements as §5.41) do not bar\n\nZachry’s breach-of-contract claim based on the R&R Order. See Argument Part\n\nIII.\n\n       (a)   The plain language of §§5.41/5.42 applies to changes during the\n\n             performance of the Contract, not to PHA’s breach of contract. See\n\n             Argument Part III.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xix\n\f(b)   The Shintech rule precludes application of §§5.41/5.42 to bar\n\n      Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim. See Argument Part III.B.1.\n\n(c)   The radical-change doctrine precludes application of §§5.41/5.42 to\n\n      bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim. See Argument Part III.B.2\n\n(d)   Section 16.071 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n      precludes application of §5.42 to bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract\n\n      claim. See Argument Part III.B.3.\n\n(e)   Zachry’s compliance with §§5.41/5.42 was not tried to the jury\n\n      because the trial court ruled before trial that §§5.41/5.42 were invalid\n\n      and/or inapplicable, the jury was instructed that it could only consider\n\n      §§5.41/5.42 for state of mind, and no jury question was submitted\n\n      regarding §§5.41/5.42. Even if §5.42 could be considered to have\n\n      been tried in such circumstances, there was factually and legally\n\n      sufficient evidence that Zachry substantially complied with §5.42.\n\n      See Argument Part III.C.\n\n(f)   Because §§5.41/5.42 were inapplicable, the trial court did not abuse\n\n      its discretion in instructing the jury that, to recover its damages from\n\n      the R&R Order, Zachry was not required to obtain a §5.41 change\n\n      order or give §5.42 notice, but could consider these provisions only in\n\n\n\n\n                                  xx\n\f            assessing state of mind, and PHA shows no harm. See Argument Part\n\n            III.\n\n      (g)   Even if PHA could establish error with respect to §§5.41/5.42, the\n\n            proper remedy is remand, not rendition. See Argument Part IV.D.\n\n7.    Section 5.08.   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding\n\nevidence that Zachry did not seek an extension of time under §5.08 for PHA’s\n\nbreach of contract, given that §5.08 does not apply to breaches of contract and is\n\nthus irrelevant; any probative value of such evidence is outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice to Zachry; and PHA has shown no harm, because the evidence\n\nis not controlling on a dispositive, material issue, nor did it probably cause the\n\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Argument Part IV.E.\n\n8.    Exclusion of $8.6 Million in Alleged Harms. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in excluding PHA's claimed $8.6 million in alleged “actual harms”\n\nclaimed as offsets based on PHA’s failure to timely disclose any intent to seek\n\nthese harms as an offset defense to be deducted from Zachry’s damages award.\n\nPHA is not entitled to a new trial to try an additional offset defense based on the\n\ntrial court’s exclusion of PHA’s claimed harms. See Argument Part IV.\n\n9.    PHA’s Open-the-Door Theory. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding a subset of PHA’s claimed actual-harms evidence with respect to the\n\n\n\n\n                                        xxi\n\farbitrary-and-capricious and bad-faith no-damages-for-delay exceptions despite\n\nfinding that the “door” had been “opened.” See Argument Part V.\n\n      (a)   There was no misimpression to correct, because Zachry only argued\n\n            that PHA promised that it would not charge liquidated damages if the\n\n            crane-ship could dock when it arrived—not that PHA would not\n\n            charge LDs if it suffered no harm at all. See Argument Part V.A.\n\n      (b)   In any event, the probative value of PHA’s actual-harms evidence in\n\n            refuting any minor misimpression would be substantially outweighed\n\n            by undue delay and the danger of unfair prejudice to Zachry. See\n\n            Argument Part V.A.\n\n      (c)   Any error in excluding the evidence was harmless. See Argument\n\n            Part V.B.\n\n10.   Recklessness instruction. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury\n\nthat recklessness could support fraud based on a promise made with an intent not\n\nto perform. And PHA shows no harm. See Argument Part VI.\n\n      (a)   The Texas Supreme Court held that the trial court properly instructed\n\n            the jury as to the no-damages-for-delay exceptions, including fraud.\n\n            See Argument Part VI.A.\n\n      (b)   The instruction was consistent with Texas law and the pattern charge.\n\n            See Argument Part VI.A.\n\n\n                                       xxii\n\f      (c)   There is factually and legally sufficient evidence that PHA\n\n            intentionally defrauded Zachry (as PHA claims it must be defined) by\n\n            entering into CO4 with no intent to perform. See Argument Part\n\n            VI.B.\n\n      (d)   Even if error, remand for a new trial is not necessary, because the\n\n            Court can be reasonably certain that the jury was not significantly\n\n            influenced by the fraud issue. See Argument Part VI.B.\n\n      (e)   PHA’s evidentiary challenge to the fraud finding is limited to the\n\n            sufficiency of the evidence to show that PHA knew that CO4 included\n\n            an agreement that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall, because\n\n            that was the only basis for its evidentiary challenge in its original\n\n            Brief of Appellant. See Aple.Br:48.\n\n11.   Apparent Authority Instruction. The trial court did not err in instructing the\n\njury on apparent authority. See Argument Part VII.\n\n      (a)   Apparent authority is a fact issue, and there was factually and legally\n\n            sufficient evidence that CH2M-Hill had apparent authority.          See\n\n            Argument Part VII.A.\n\n      (b)   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Zachry\n\n            pleaded apparent authority. See Argument Part VII.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xxiii\n\f      (c)   Any error in instructing the jury regarding apparent authority is\n\n            harmless. Aple.Br:73-74.\n\n12.   Attorneys’ fees. PHA is not entitled to attorneys’ fees if any judgment is\n\nentered for Zachry in this case. See Argument Part VIII.\n\n13.   Pass-through damages. The trial court properly entered judgment allowing\n\nZachry to recover damages that were incurred by the subcontractor that it created\n\nin a corporate reorganization and that performed some of the Contract work\n\npursuant to a “pass-through agreement” with Zachry, as authorized by Interstate\n\nContracting Corp. v. City of Dallas, 135 S.W.3d 605, 610 (Tex. 2004). See\n\nArgument Part IX.\n\n      (a)   Zachry asserted a valid pass-through claim. See Argument Part IX.A.\n\n      (b)   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in instructing the jury with\n\n            respect to the pass-through damages. See Argument Part IX.B.\n\n      (c)   Governmental immunity does not bar Zachry's pass-through claim.\n\n            See Argument Part IX.C.\n\n14.   Waiver. PHA cannot obtain reversal of the judgment based on arguments\n\nnot raised in the trial court, errors as to which PHA has shown no harm, errors\n\nraised for the first time in its supplemental brief, and errors as to which PHA on\n\nappeal has provided no meaningful argument and/or has not cited authority or\n\nevidence.\n\n\n                                       xxiv\n\f                          STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n      In the Supreme Court, PHA and Zachry briefed the facts pertaining to\n\nPHA’s multiple issues, all of which PHA raises again here. The Court observed\n\nthe evidence “was hotly disputed” and the standard of review required it to view\n\ndisputed evidence in Zachry’s favor:\n\n      In reviewing any case tried to a jury, we must view the evidence “in\n      the light most favorable to the verdict”—in this case a verdict for\n      [Zachry]—“crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could,\n      and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could\n      not”....\n\nZachry, 449 S.W.3d at 101 n.3(A3). The Court recited the evidence “in that light.”\n\nId.\n\n      The same standard applies to this Court’s review on remand. Yet PHA\n\nnever mentions the governing standard and ignores the Supreme Court’s factual\n\nrecitations pursuant to it. As a result, PHA erroneously portrays the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to PHA, not Zachry.\n\n      This fact statement comports with the standard governing this Court’s\n\nreview on remand.\n\nI.    PHA hires Zachry to construct a wharf and understands Zachry plans\n      to use a freeze-wall means and methods.\n      In 1999, PHA hired DMJM to design a 1660-foot wharf. 6:8-9, 90. The\n\nproject was subsequently delayed five years. 67:40-41; PX466.0004. In 2004,\n\nPHA hired CH2M-Hill as construction manager—PHA’s on-site representative\n\n                                        1\n\fand primary point-of-contact with the project’s general contractor (ultimately,\n\nZachry). 6:84-86; 20:38; 44:43-44.\n\n      That same year, PHA chose Zachry to build the wharf because, among other\n\nreasons, Zachry’s unique means and methods of construction—a frozen wall—\n\nused fewer emissions credits, as the freeze-wall would enable Zachry to build the\n\nwharf primarily on dry land (“in the dry”), rather than in the water (“in the wet”).\n\n7:15-16; 39:46.\n\n      Zachry’s choice of means and methods was critical to sequencing\n\nconstruction tasks.    The project originally entailed installing the following\n\nalongside the bay:\n\n      *     a five-section, concrete wharf deck;\n\n      *     thousands of under-deck concrete drilled shafts, or piers; and\n\n      *     concrete revetment blocks protecting the under-deck soil slope. 9:25,\n            27-28, 59-61.\n\n      To accomplish these tasks in the dry, Zachry’s unique means and methods\n\nentailed building a frozen, u-shaped soil berm around the construction site to hold\n\nback the bay. 9:58-61. Zachry would sink pipes into the berm and then freeze it\n\nby circulating sub-freezing brine through the pipes. While building the wall,\n\nZachry would simultaneously build the wharf in the dry behind it, drilling concrete\n\npiers into the ground and then building the deck on top, using the ground as a\n\nconcrete form. Zachry would then excavate dirt under the wharf and among the\n                                         2\n\fpiers using dry-land equipment (e.g., bulldozers). Once the u-shaped berm was\n\nfrozen, Zachry could excavate even deeper. As it completed excavation, Zachry\n\nwould place revetment on the under-deck slope. Zachry would then breach the\n\nfreeze-wall, allowing water to reach the wharf, and then remove the remainder of\n\nthe freeze-wall in the wet. See 9:27-28, 59-73.\n\n      This plan depended on using the freeze-wall and—importantly—working in\n\nthe dry until the freeze-wall was breached: a contractor working in the wet would\n\nnever build the piers and deck before excavating, given the difficulty and cost of\n\nexcavating and placing revetment underwater, beneath the deck, and among the\n\npiers. 9:76-77; 47:34.\n\n      By October 2003, PHA began asking Zachry about the effect of freezing soil\n\nnear piers. 7:24-27; 37:31-32; PX49.0002-3; PX67; PX116.           Among other\n\nprecautions, Zachry and freeze-wall-designer Dan Mageau stated they would keep\n\nfrozen soils nine feet away from the drilled shafts “wherever possible.” PX6.006.\n\nThus, if it were not possible, they would not. 9:149. PHA—which had no soil-\n\nfreeze expertise—requested the nine-foot distance, which had no scientific basis.\n\n29:62-63. Mageau, the project’s only soil-freeze expert, established through tests\n\nprovided to PHA that “one freeze-thaw cycle does not appear to reduce the shear\n\nstrength in the soil.” PX138.0014; PX7.0010; 29:106-08; see 21:112.\n\n      PHA and Zachry executed the Contract June 1, 2004. DX1. It was PHA’s\n\n\n                                         3\n\fform contract. 6:21-24. Given its 5-year delay, PHA imposed a tight, two-year\n\ncompletion deadline. 6:88; 64:22; DX1-1.0002. There was an interim deadline\n\n(“Milestone-A”) of February 1, 2006 to finish 660 feet of wharf to allow a ship to\n\ndeliver cranes from China. 9:79.\n\nII.      The Contract makes Zachry solely responsible for choosing the means\n         and methods of construction and precludes PHA control.\n         The freeze-wall (and later, frozen-cutoff wall) was undisputedly Zachry’s\n\nconstruction means and methods. 6:76; 8:90, 94; 26:123; 37:52-53. Contract\n\n§5.10 made Zachry solely responsible for its means and methods and barred PHA\n\ninterference:\n\n         The Port Authority shall not have the right to control the manner in which\n         or prescribe the method by which the Contractor performs the Work. As an\n         independent Contractor, the Contractor shall be solely responsible for\n         supervision of and performance of the Work and shall prosecute the Work\n         at such time and seasons, in such order or precedence, and in such manner,\n         using such methods as Contractor shall choose....\n\nDX1-1.0214(A13). 3 Nothing in §5.10 permitted PHA to reject Zachry’s methods.\n\n27:26-27; pp.26-27.\n\n         PHA conceded §5.10’s purpose was to “isolat[e] the Port Authority from\n\nhaving any responsibilities for the contract[or]’s means and methods,” and “keep\n\nthe responsibility and liability on [the contractor’s] side of the table.” 8:91, 93; see\n\n6:39-42; 27:6-7. The Supreme Court recognized this “provision benefitted the\n\n3\n    Emphasis added unless noted otherwise.\n\n                                             4\n\fPort, insulating it from liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising\n\ncontrol over Zachry’s work.” 449 S.W.3d at 102 & n.4(A3)(citing Gen. Elec. v.\n\nMoritz, 257 S.W.3d 211, 214 (Tex. 2008)).\n\n       Consistent with this purpose, nothing in the Contract gave PHA the right to\n\nissue the October 11, 2005 revise-and-resubmit order (“R&R Order”). See pp.26-\n\n34. To avoid any claim of control and attendant liability, PHA did not approve or\n\nreject the main freeze-wall, but simply ensured it had been approved by a Texas\n\nProfessional Engineer (“PE”) and “accepted [it] for records.” 37:115-16; 44:90;\n\npp.28-29.\n\nIII.   PHA belatedly adds an extension to the wharf design and recognizes\n       only Zachry can timely build it and only with the frozen-cutoff wall.\n       Nine months into the Contract—less than a year before Milestone-A—PHA\n\nbelatedly realized its 5-year-old wharf design was too short, and added a 332-foot\n\nsixth section. PX130.0004; PX141.0016; 7:34-37. PHA concluded only Zachry\n\ncould timely build the extension within emissions limits. PX3(A28); PX224(A24);\n\n8:22-27; 22:103-07; 45:138-40; see 7:37-40, 78; 38:34-35; PX192.002. PHA knew\n\nZachry was pressed to timely finish, and that PHA had to move quickly to avoid\n\ndelay. PX164, ¶9; PX172 at 3; 7:35-37, 44, 84-85; 25:50-53; 45:79.\n\n       To accommodate PHA’s belated addition, Zachry would have to modify its\n\nmethods to add a “frozen-cutoff wall” to ensure it could timely complete\n\nMilestone-A to allow the crane-ship to dock and finish the remainder of the wharf\n\n                                        5\n\fin the dry. 7:99-101; 9:138-39; 27:96; 38:51-53; PX8.0011(A20). On April 5,\n\n2005, Zachry’s Project Manager Andy Anderson told CH2M-Hill’s Construction\n\nManager Andy Thiess and Design Manager Jeff Ely that Zachry’s extension\n\nproposal was based on using a frozen-cutoff wall, which he sketched and explained\n\nwould encompass one B-row pier. PX8.0004-5, .0013(A20); 10:18-29; 21:128-30;\n\n38:39, 46, 48-49, 61-62, 130-31. Thiess and Ely understood the frozen-cutoff wall\n\nwould also be 4.5 feet from two rows of piers, and promptly sketched and\n\ndescribed the wall to PHA officials, including Project Manager Jim McQueen and\n\nBayport Engineer Mark Vincent (who reported to Chief Engineer Steve DeWolf,\n\nmanaged the project for him, and was charged with helping administer the Contract\n\ncorrectly on PHA’s behalf). 7:32, 104-11; 21:104-08, 128-29; 24:120, 135-39;\n\n38:62-63; 44:83; 45:41-46; 64:34-35; PX61.\n\n       PHA contends Thiess and Ely were not concerned about the design at the\n\nApril 5 meeting because they believed the frozen soil would impact only the single\n\nB-row pier entirely encompassed by the frozen-cutoff wall. PHASupp:5. But Ely\n\nand Vincent testified they were concerned because the 4.5-foot distance between\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall and piers was half the nine-foot buffer Zachry said it would\n\nmaintain “whenever possible.”4         21:110-11, 138-39; 45:63; p.3.         Furthermore,\n\n4\n PHA’s assertion that Thiess was unconcerned because he thought 4.5 feet (1½ pier diameters)\nwas acceptable based on a “rule of thumb” was discredited: nothing documented the “rule,” and\nPHA’s geotechnical experts were unaware of it. 27:121-23; 38:68-69, 73-74.\n\n                                             6\n\fThiess, Ely, Vincent, and DeWolf knew the “freeze front” would migrate away\n\nfrom the freeze-pipes and “go around” the piers 4.5 feet away (if not stopped).\n\n7:52-53, 106-14; 10:26-27; 21:139; 25:38-39; 29:68; 37:117-18; 45:63;\n\nPX138.0018. Ely told Vincent, Thiess, and McQueen that freezing would occur\n\nvery close to some piers, in his view potentially reducing their capacity. 22:96-97,\n\n128-29; 23:5-8, 24.\n\n      PHA also asserts Anderson had considered a frozen-cutoff wall as an option\n\nto help Zachry timely complete Milestone-A. PHASupp:4.              However, PHA\n\nunderstood the frozen-cutoff wall became “required if Zachry were going to do the\n\nextension” and still meet the Milestone-A deadline. 7:99-101; see 9:138-39; 10:31,\n\n112; 27:96; 28:31-32; 38:51-53; PX8.0011(A20). The reason was simple. With\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry could timely accommodate the crane-ship’s arrival\n\non one side of the cutoff-wall and still finish the remainder of the wharf, including\n\nthe extension, in the dry on the other. 10:35; 38:38; 7:100-01; 28:31-33; PX172 at\n\n4-5. Without the frozen-cutoff wall, the addition of the sixth wharf section meant\n\nZachry would have to try to complete, excavate, and place revetment under the\n\nentirety of the now-20% longer wharf by the Milestone-A deadline; at that time,\n\nthe main freeze-wall would be breached to dock the crane-ship, and Zachry would\n\nhave to finish the entire project in the wet.          9:135-36; 21:94; 28:33-34;\n\nPX8.0011(A20).\n\n\n                                         7\n\fIV.   PHA conceals its unsubstantiated “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff\n      wall to induce Zachry into agreeing to build the extension.\n      On April 13, 2005, Zachry sent PHA a proposal to build the wharf extension\n\nbased on an “[u]ninterrupted work process” and the “[u]se of a freeze wall—cut off\n\nwall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling.” PX9(A21); 10:111. These conditions\n\nwere unchanged by a May 18 proposal and July 11 supplemental proposal.\n\nPX179(A22); PX219(A23).\n\n      PHA understood Zachry’s price was based on these conditions, and that the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall in the proposals was the same one described to Thiess and Ely\n\non April 5. 22:22-25; 25:44-47; 38:96-97; 45:75-76. PHA also knew the frozen-\n\ncutoff wall was Zachry’s only means and methods to timely complete the wharf.\n\n22:125-26; 26:119-20; 38:112; 45:103-04; 46:40.\n\n      Even though PHA knew the frozen-cutoff wall was “required,” it never told\n\nZachry its concerns, 11:13; 22:96, 146, despite knowing quick resolution of such\n\nconcerns was critical to avoid delaying Zachry under the tight schedule.\n\nPX46.0001; 7:43-44, 67-68; 20:53-56.\n\n      The Supreme Court recognized that PHA—afraid Zachry might decline to\n\nbuild the extension—induced Zachry into entering Change Order 4 (“CO4”) to\n\nbuild it by intentionally concealing PHA’s concerns about the frozen-cutoff wall:\n\n      As a practical matter, only Zachry could perform the additional work.\n      . . . The Port had reservations about this [frozen-cutoff wall] plan. But\n      the Port was also concerned that if it rejected Zachry’s plan, Zachry\n\n                                         8\n\f      might simply refuse to undertake the addition of a sixth section. So\n      the Port did not raise its concern with Zachry.\n\n449 S.W.3d at 102-03(A3).\n\n      The Supreme Court’s conclusion was amply supported. PHA knew only\n\nZachry could build the extension without undue additional cost and delay. See p.5.\n\nBut Zachry was already on a tight schedule. See pp.4, 5. Adding the sixth section\n\nmeant Zachry would have to do 20% more work, p.7, though CO4 would only\n\nextend Milestone-A by 15 days, see p.4; PX12.0004 (A30).\n\n      However, PHA had not signed CO4. 8:36; 27:40. As a result, Zachry could\n\nnot begin working on the extension, exacerbating the already-tight schedule.\n\nPX225 at 4-5; PX226 at 3-6; PX228; PX229; PX232 at 13; 10:52-54, 68, 73;\n\n26:68; 18:84-87; 26:93-94, 102-09. And Zachry was not contractually bound to\n\nbuild it. 27:40. PHA Project Manager McQueen blamed PHA “bureaucrats” for\n\nthe delay. PX215 at 7.\n\n      Aware of Zachry’s time-crunch and that Zachry was not yet bound, PHA\n\n“management [wa]s afraid ZCC w[ould] back out of the extension agreement.”\n\nPX280(A29); 27:40; 45:113. PHA therefore acted to keep Zachry on the hook by\n\ninducing it into CO4.\n\n      First, although PHA knew throughout the summer of 2005 that Zachry\n\nprojected it would not timely complete Milestone-A (because Zachry was\n\nincluding an extension of time it claimed under Contract §5.08 due to a global-\n                                        9\n\fcement shortage), PHA decided to pay Zachry anyway and delay taking any formal\n\naction against it—such as demanding a recovery schedule—until after CO4’s\n\nexecution. PX159; PX176; PX210; PX280(A29); PX319; 18:143-49; 22:109-11;\n\n27:36-40; 39:17-18; see p.17.\n\n      Second, PHA allayed Zachry’s concerns about the $20,000/day Milestone-A\n\nliquidated damages (“LDs”).      PHA had denied Zachry’s request to extend\n\nMilestone-A based on the global-cement shortage. PX159; PX175; PX176; 25:60-\n\n61. Zachry thus sought assurances that PHA would not charge LDs if the crane-\n\nship could dock upon arrival. 25:66-67; PX177. In that case, PHA would not be\n\ncharged demurrage—the basis for Milestone-A’s $20,000/day LDs. 45:65-66; see\n\nalso PX935 at 1, PX936 at 4; DX1-1.0021(A17).         Recognizing the ship was\n\ndelayed, PHA’s Vincent told McQueen that “[a]lthough we will not put it in\n\nwriting,” McQueen should tell Zachry PHA “will not charge penalties if no\n\nexpense or loss to PHA occurs….” PX176; 28:71. McQueen complied, telling\n\nAnderson PHA would not charge LDs if the ship could dock upon arrival (because\n\nPHA would not be charged demurrage). 10:41; see 28:74.\n\n      Although PHA contends it promised not to charge LDs only if PHA\n\nsustained no harm whatsoever, McQueen confirmed Zachry’s understanding: he\n\ntestified PHA acted contrary to its promise in charging LDs even though the crane-\n\nship docked upon arrival. 28:74; see also PX205.0002. The Supreme Court\n\n\n                                       10\n\fcorrectly concluded that “[i]n negotiating [CO4], PHA had promised not to impose\n\n[LDs]...as long as the [crane-]ship…could dock when it arrived,” but\n\n“[n]evertheless, after the ship successfully docked,…began withholding [LDs].”\n\n449 S.W.3d at 103(A3).\n\n      Third, despite its “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff wall it knew was\n\n“required” to allow Zachry to meet Milestone-A, PHA did not object to it before\n\nCO4 was signed. 11:13, 106; 19:80-81; 22:76, 96, 119. PHA instead agreed in\n\nCO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall. See pp.12-13, 33-34.\n\nV.    PHA waits to reject the frozen-cutoff wall until after Zachry is bound by\n      CO4, which plainly incorporates the frozen-cutoff wall.\n      On September 9, 2005, soil-freeze expert Mageau sent Zachry the frozen-\n\ncutoff-wall design. PX10(A25). It was identical in all material respects to the wall\n\ndiscussed at the April 5 meeting and incorporated into the proposals. PX10.0001-\n\n.0002, .0005(A25); 8:42-43, 53; 10:94-98, 111; 22:73-77; 29:123-24.\n\n      Anderson directed the design be sent to PHA “for review. Not approval—\n\nbut review.” PX267; 10:92-93. On September 12, Zachry labeled the design\n\n“Correspondence” (not “Submittal”) and uploaded it to PHA, noting PHA could\n\n“see what will be happening and gather questions.”        PX897; 8:39; 11:33-34;\n\n38:152, 157; 45:143. PHA knew it was not provided as a Submittal, and that\n\nZachry was not asking for approval, just comments. 38:152-53, 157; 45:143-44.\n\nLike the main freeze-wall, PHA could review it for a Texas PE’s approval, but\n\n                                        11\n\fcould not approve, reject, or order Zachry to revise and resubmit it. 9:49-50;\n\n11:28; 22:70-72, 93-94; 23:91-92; DX5.002; pp.5, 28-29. CH2M-Hill’s Thiess\n\ntold PHA’s McQueen internally, “[t]his isn’t going to be an approval-type thing,”\n\nPX274 at 3(A26); 39:37-38, but recognized PHA “need[ed] due diligence to\n\nidentify and communicate any technical issues,” PX11(A27); 22:93-94.\n\n      Based on the September 9 design, PHA’s Vincent and McQueen understood\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall “was freezing up and near the shafts.” 46:5; see 26:150-52.\n\nCH2M-Hill’s Ely noted they needed to “verify the freeze wall won’t reduce the\n\ncapacity of the…piers.”       PX11(A27).    Nevertheless, PHA management on\n\nSeptember 14 formally recommended PHA execute CO4. PX3(A28); 26:161-63;\n\n39:44-49; 45:147-48.\n\n      PHA finally executed CO4 on September 27. PX12.0002(A30). As the\n\nSupreme Court recognized, CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall embodied in the September 9 design:\n\n      To complete the two sections of the wharf needed by February 2006\n      and to continue to work ‘in the dry,’ Zachry proposed to build another\n      freeze-wall—a cutoff wall—through the middle of the\n      project....Change Order 4, using Zachry’s approach to add a sixth\n      section of the wharf...was finalized September 27, 2005.\n\n449 S.W.3d at 101, n.3(A3).\n\n      CO4 provided Zachry would construct the extension “in accordance with the\n\nattached Scope, Time and Price Modifications,” which incorporated Zachry’s\n\n\n                                       12\n\fproposals conditioned on an “[u]ninterrupted work process” and the “[u]se of a\n\nfreeze wall—cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling.” See pp.8, 33-34;\n\nPX12.0001, .0004(A30); 26:112-14. PHA had reviewed the September 9 design,\n\nwhich embodied the April 5 design described in the proposals, for two weeks\n\nbefore executing CO4. 10:111-16, 118, 8:50-51; 22:92, 119-20; 27:37; 45:147-48;\n\np.34.\n\n        Although PHA’s Vincent and McQueen had known for two weeks (and\n\nreally since April 5, p.6-7) that the frozen-cutoff wall design involved freezing\n\nnear piers, Ely—on the same day PHA signed CO4—reiterated to McQueen that\n\nfrozen soils would be kept only one foot from piers, allegedly putting 23 piers “at\n\nrisk for capacity reduction.” PX286. He did so despite freeze-soil expert Mageau’s\n\ntests proving “one freeze-thaw cycle does not appear to reduce the shear strength in\n\nthe soil.” See p.3.\n\n        On September 28, Mageau provided PHA more analyses proving that even if\n\nsoil were frozen all the way around the piers, there would be virtually no increase\n\nin settlement. PX14.0001(A31); 22:150-51; 27:66; 29:76-77; 39:66-69. PHA\n\nknew there was no reason for concern. 39:66-69; PX504(A36). But no one\n\nassociated with PHA would take responsibility for allowing Zachry to move\n\nforward:\n\n*       McQueen told CH2M-Hill “I have a problem and we need an answer\n        ASAP,” and that Ely and Thiess had “to take the lead in resolving this\n                                        13\n\f      problem w/a solution.” PX301.\n\n*     CH2M-Hill would not opine on the design, because it did not want to incur\n      liability for Zachry’s methods. 23:89; 30:84-85; 46:43.\n\n*     Wharf-designer DMJM refused to review the design because it was Zachry’s\n      means and methods. 30:63-64; 46:41-42.\n\n*     PHA had not yet hired its geotechnical engineer, GeoTest, to review the\n      design, and knew GeoTest would never give a definitive answer anyway.\n      PX1(A32); 23:23, 75-76.\n\nInstead, Ely surveyed CH2M-Hill’s geotechnical experts about his “concern,”\n\nexplaining he wanted to “give our client some guidance without incurring\n\nadditional liability if possible.” PX15; 22:157-61; 23:25-28. Most responders—\n\nincluding some with soil-freeze experience—concluded the design presented no\n\nconcern.   PX290; PX292; PX293; 23:31-47; 46:19-24.           Nevertheless, Ely\n\ndisregarded these geotechnical experts, and sent PHA a memo expressing\n\nunsubstantiated “concerns” about this geotechnical issue “from a structural\n\nengineering, not geotechnical perspective.” PX301; 23:56-62; see PX11(A27).\n\n      PHA conceded at trial it had not determined—or even tried to determine—\n\nthat the frozen-cutoff wall was likely to adversely affect piers, 8:79-80, 89-90;\n\n22:84; 23:97, 101-02; 24:112-14; 27:32, 80-84; 46:30-36, 58-59, although Chief\n\nEngineer DeWolf expected his engineers to get GeoTest involved, 6:7, 10; 7:110-\n\n14. PHA’s only information consisted of soil-freeze expert Mageau’s reports\n\nproving freezing would have no adverse effect. 24:112-13; 27:66; 39:96; 46:27,\n\n\n                                       14\n\f30-31, 57-59; PX14(A31); PX138.0014.\n\nVI.   PHA issues its R&R Order, which everyone understands rejected the\n      frozen-cutoff wall and which Zachry makes clear to PHA constitutes a\n      breach.\n      Despite knowing the tight schedule and imminent Milestone-A deadline,\n\npp.4, 5, 9, on October 11, 2005, PHA switched the September 9 design’s label\n\nfrom “Correspondence” to “Submittal” and issued the R&R Order. PX266(A33);\n\n11:31, 33-34; 27:82, 88-89. The order expressed concern about freezing’s effect\n\n“on the friction resistance of the piles,” and stated “preliminary indications are\n\nthat the design may have an indeterminate affect [sic] on a significant number of\n\nnearby shafts which may present unacceptable risk to the Port”—a concern\n\nVincent and McQueen admitted was “speculation.” PX266(A33); 27:84; 46:49-50.\n\n      Everyone knew the R&R Order rejected the frozen-cutoff wall. See, e.g.,\n\n39:133-36; PX1(A32); PX2(A35); PX358.0001. PHA conceded this at trial. 4:94;\n\n27:74; 39:135. The frozen-cutoff wall was undisputedly Zachry’s means and\n\nmethods, and Zachry had the right to use it under Contract §5.10 and CO4. See\n\npp.4-5, 12-13, 26-34. Yet, as the Supreme Court recognized, “[t]he practical effect\n\nof the Port’s [R&R] order was to refuse to allow the construction of the cutoff\n\nwall.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3); see 8:69-70; 21:58-59; 45:34-35; DX1-1.0219-20,\n\n§5.22(A13) (subject of revise-and-resubmit order “may not be used for\n\nperformance of the Work”). Although PHA now claims Zachry could have offered\n\n\n                                        15\n\fa means of mitigating the frozen-cutoff wall’s “risk,” PHA demanded a nonfrozen\n\nalternative. PX4.0003 (“The cut-off wall…cannot be constructed using freeze-wall\n\ntechnology.”); PX314 at 3-4(A34); 11:56; 23:101; 27:87-88; 68:114.\n\n      Although PHA mischaracterizes this as a “secret breach,” the Supreme Court\n\ncorrectly concluded Zachry told PHA it was a breach: “Zachry protested that,\n\nunder [§]5.10…, the Port had no right to determine the method and manner of the\n\nwork, but the Port would not budge.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3). At the October 11\n\nmeeting where the R&R Order was delivered, Anderson immediately objected that\n\nit was contrary to the Contract: he told PHA the design was “not a submittal that\n\nrequires approval,” but “is for information purposes only,” and Zachry’s risk to\n\naccept. PX314 at 4, 6-7(A34); 11:33-34, 39; 18:127-28; 23:102-04; 27:88-89.\n\nMcQueen responded, “I understand.” PX314 at 7(A34).          McQueen expressed\n\nconcern PHA could be liable and admitted he knew Anderson was saying PHA\n\nviolated the Contract. PX1(A32); PX287; 23:82-85; 27:48-49, 89-90, 93-94; see\n\nalso 44:82-83 (Vincent). Later on October 11, Anderson told Thiess the R&R\n\nOrder was a breach. 11:40-41. A month later, Thiess acknowledged Zachry had\n\nclaimed PHA’s “rejection of the cutoff-wall design is a breach of the change order\n\ncontract.” PX2(A35); 39:130; 68:122.\n\nVII. PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall forces Zachry to complete\n     construction in the wet.\n      Contrary to PHA’s claim that Zachry voluntarily switched to working in the\n\n                                       16\n\fwet, the evidence establishes PHA forced Zachry to do so. First, PHA barred\n\nZachry from using its frozen-cutoff wall—the means and methods PHA knew was\n\n“required” to timely complete the wharf in the dry, given the additional extension\n\nwork. See pp.7, 8, 15. Then, three days later, despite having known for months\n\nthat Zachry projected a delayed Milestone-A completion, pp.9-10, 18.        Chief\n\nEngineer DeWolf for the first time sent Zachry a letter demanding a recovery\n\nschedule (showing Zachry would finish by the Contract deadlines, which were\n\nconditioned on the frozen-cutoff wall) and threatening LDs. PX319; 19:29-31.\n\nHigher-ranking PHA officials repeated this demand in October and November.\n\nSee, e.g., 40:32-33, 38-40; 46:82-83; 66:86-87; DX85; DX205.003; PX373.0003;\n\nPX925. See also 35:6; 36:5-7.\n\n      By demanding a recovery schedule after barring Zachry’s frozen-cutoff wall,\n\nPHA necessarily forced Zachry to begin working in the wet far earlier than it\n\notherwise would have. 18:115-17, 123-26; 28:31-33; see 9:137-38; 11:82-96;\n\n19:33-50; DX404. Without the frozen-cutoff wall, neither Milestone-A nor the\n\nremainder of the wharf could be constructed in the dry. 9:137-38; 11:85-86; p.7,\n\n20.   There was no viable alternate cutoff wall.     46:83; p.20.   This demand\n\nconstituted a direction to perform additional work, because—as PHA knew,\n\n40:131; 46:133-34; PX373.0003; PX461—building the wharf in the wet would\n\ntake far more time and money than building it in the dry, id.; 10:62; 29:40-42;\n\n\n                                       17\n\f33:6; 47:60-61; 52:31, 102; 61:110.\n\n       Zachry refuted PHA’s assertion that Zachry voluntarily switched to working\n\nin the wet because it could not meet the schedule using the freeze-walls. In late\n\nSeptember/early October, Zachry was still projecting a March 22 Milestone-A\n\ncompletion. 18:116-18; DX404. But PHA knew—based on reports from PHA’s\n\non-site inspectors and Zachry’s scheduler—that Zachry could finish Milestone-A\n\nby the February 15 deadline and that schedules showing a March 22 completion\n\nwere a “paperwork trail” preserving Zachry’s claim for extension of time based on\n\nthe global-cement shortage.5        PX251; PX252; PX283; 26:100-02; 45:103-05;\n\n65:92-93, 99-100, 105; pp.9-10.\n\n       Three days after PHA’s rejection, Mageau projected Zachry could finish\n\nMilestone-A by the February 15 deadline and certainly by March 22—before the\n\ncrane-ship’s arrival. PX320; 30:115-16; 32:105-06. And Larry Applegate, the\n\nfreeze-wall subcontractor’s president, stated on November 11, 2005 that freeze-\n\ndown Phase 1 could begin immediately with the remainder starting by\n\nThanksgiving. PX360.0002; 33:47, 50-54. Mageau and Anderson agreed, despite\n\nfreeze-pipe-related and other challenges Zachry faced. 18:105-11; 30:115-18;\n\n32:100-01; PX320. This would have allowed Zachry to finish Milestone-A before\n5\n  Anderson’s comment post-Hurricane Rita that there wasn’t “a snowball’s chance in hell of\nhaving that wharf open by March...’cause the math don’t work,’” DX1157A, referred to Zachry’s\n9-day extension request for hurricane-caused delays. 19:113-15. Adding 9 working days to the\nprojected March 22 date pushed completion into April. Id.\n\n                                             18\n\fthe crane-ship arrived. 19:43-45.\n\n      PHA points to schedules Zachry created on October 31 purportedly showing\n\nZachry finishing much later than projected in its October 3 schedule. But the\n\nOctober 31 schedules were unfinished, non-concurrent schedules: they listed tasks\n\nend-to-end rather than accurately reflecting concurrent performance, thereby\n\nappearing artificially lengthy. 40:45-47, 55. See PX779.0005; PX777.0005;\n\nPX780.0005; 18:119-23; 19:50-55; 28:11-13, 16.\n\n      More importantly, these schedules were brain-storming exercises created\n\nafter PHA’s October 11 rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall that PHA knew was\n\n“required” to allow Zachry to meet the Milestone-A deadline. See pp.7, 8, 11.\n\nWithout the frozen-cutoff wall, it was difficult for Zachry to create schedules\n\nwithout knowing its means and methods. 19:38-43; 40:69-79; 46:67.          Zachry\n\ncreated 38 draft schedules in an attempt to determine which construction method to\n\nuse. 11:83-87; 40:70-71; PX373. Unlike the pre-October 11 schedules, none used\n\na frozen-cutoff wall under the wharf—thus confirming its rejection. 18:124-25;\n\n35:101; 46:76-82; see 28:22, 31-33.\n\n      PHA contends the schedules showed Zachry would finish soonest by\n\nremoving the main freeze-wall and working in the wet. PHASupp:12. But these\n\nschedules were the result of PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall—combined\n\nwith the lack of a viable alternate-cutoff wall.   Zachry’s alternate-cutoff-wall\n\n\n                                       19\n\fschedule projected a later finish date because the alternative method of building the\n\ncutoff wall was still “unidentified,” and Zachry had to project extra time to design\n\nit, procure materials, and build it. PX779; 40:45, 48; 46:91. Zachry quickly\n\ndetermined an alternate cutoff wall was not viable, because there were serious\n\ndoubts it could be designed and no time to implement it, given the imminent\n\nMilestone-A deadline. 19:38-50; 28:22; 46:78-79, 90-92. Indeed, when Mageau\n\ndelivered an alternate-cutoff-wall design on November 16, it was unworkable,\n\nunsafe, and could have damaged piers. 11:50, 52-58; 19:45-50; 42:64-67, 77-79,\n\n91-98; PX366; PX931 at 19-21; see 58:107-08.\n\n      PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall made meeting the Contract\n\ndeadlines “an impossible task,” in light of the wharf extension. 19:57-60. Without\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry would now have to complete the entire main freeze-\n\nwall, freeze it, and excavate the entire 2,000 feet of the now-extended wharf by the\n\nMilestone-A deadline, 28:33-34—all of which would take far longer than the prior\n\nplan of completing only the Milestone-A area. 11:45-49; 32:131-33. For this\n\nreason, someone at Zachry noted on November 3 that—in the absence of the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall—the main “freezewall” was “killing [the] baseline schedule.”\n\nDX82.006; 19:56-58.\n\n      Given PHA’s rejection and recovery-schedule demands, Zachry’s only hope\n\nof meeting the Milestone-A deadline was to use the unfrozen berm as a seawall as\n\n\n                                         20\n\flong as possible, completing Milestone-A and excavating under the wharf as\n\nquickly as possible, then breaching the berm for the crane-ship’s arrival and\n\nfinishing the remainder in the wet. 11:87-89.       The Supreme Court correctly\n\nconcluded that, following the R&R Order, “Zachry’s only option was to finish the\n\nwestern-most sections in time for the ship from China to dock, then remove the\n\nwall altogether and continue to work ‘in the wet,’ which would delay completion\n\nof the project and increase its cost.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3).\n\n      Having now deprived Zachry of its freeze-wall methods, PHA grew\n\nconcerned about its liability. 24:70-73. It met with lawyers, and on November 18\n\ntold Zachry, “[i]n accordance with...[§]5.10,” PHA had no right to interfere with\n\nZachry’s methods. PX18; 46:123-24. But PHA did not withdraw its rejection.\n\n46:126. Instead, PHA insisted PHA’s lawyers choose from among the schedule\n\noptions, and they chose an in-the-wet schedule with a May 28 Milestone-A\n\ncompletion date. PX367.002; PX373.0002, PX380; 19:66-71; 40:120-22, 128.\n\n      On January 16, 2006, Zachry sent PHA a letter confirming its change to\n\nworking in the wet was the “direct result” of PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, recovery-schedule demands, and LD threats. PX20.0003.\n\nVIII. Working in the wet causes Zachry substantial damages for which it\n      sues.\n      Zachry worked in the dry behind the berm as long as possible. 47:47-58.\n\nAfter it was breached, Zachry completed the wharf in the wet under “nightmare”\n\n                                        21\n\fconditions, excavating and placing revetment underwater beneath the deck with\n\nalmost zero visibility. 29:40-42; 40:131; 47:79.\n\n      Zachry sufficiently completed Milestone-A to allow the crane-ship to dock\n\nupon arrival May 15, 2006. 11:117; 40:131-33; 47:68-69; PX893.0076. Yet PHA\n\nback-charged Zachry $2.36 million in LDs from the Milestone-A deadline forward,\n\nalthough PHA incurred no demurrage. 40:131-32; 45:72-73. McQueen admitted\n\nthis was contrary to his promise. 28:73-74.\n\n      In October 2008, Zachry substantially completed the project. 47:80-81;\n\nPX578. Despite heavy losses, Zachry sought only damages caused by PHA’s\n\nbreach—the increased cost of construction as a result of PHA’s delays and forcing\n\nZachry to work in the wet earlier than it otherwise would have. 47:86-87.\n\n      After a three-month trial, the jury found PHA failed to comply with CO4\n\nand §5.10, causing Zachry $18,602,697 in damages. CR59:17390-93(A4). The\n\njudgment awarded those damages, plus $2.36 million PHA withheld as LDs, minus\n\na $970,000 offset for wharf fenders, for a recovery of $19,992,697, plus interest.\n\nCR62:18166(A1).\n\n      This Court, based on its holdings that the no-damages-for-delay clause\n\nprecludes Zachry’s recovery and that PHA’s release defense barred Zachry’s\n\nrecovery of the LDs, reversed and rendered judgment that Zachry take nothing and\n\nPHA recover $10,500,000 in attorney’s fees, plus contingent appellate fees. 377\n\n\n                                        22\n\fS.W.3d at 865(A2).\n\n      The Supreme Court held governmental immunity did not bar Zachry’s\n\nclaims, reversed this Court’s judgment regarding the no-damages-for-delay clause\n\nand LDs, and remanded. 449 S.W.3d at 119-20(A3).\n\n\n\n\n                                      23\n\f                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The Supreme Court rejected PHA’s main appellate points—immunity, no-\n\ndamages-for-delay, and release. PHA is left with a laundry list of second-tier\n\narguments that largely invite this Court to revisit evidentiary disputes resolved by\n\nthe jury, issues committed to the trial court’s discretion, and issues the Supreme\n\nCourt previously decided against PHA. PHA’s invitation should be declined.\n\n      In Questions 1 and 2, the jury properly rejected PHA’s contrived reading of\n\nCO4 and §5.10. Unlike Zachry, PHA offers no interpretation that harmonizes all\n\nContract provisions and satisfies PHA’s business purpose—to avoid liability from\n\ncontrol of Zachry’s methods. PHA’s challenge to the damages and causation\n\nfindings in Question 3 likewise ignores the substantial evidence supporting them.\n\n      Nor do Contract §§5.41/5.42 bar Zachry’s claims. These “changes” clauses\n\nplainly allow PHA to change the scope of the Work during Contract performance.\n\nThey do not govern Zachry’s rights in the event of a PHA breach. If they did, they\n\nwould be inapplicable under common-law and statutory rules.\n\n      PHA’s remaining arguments are also without merit. The trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in rejecting PHA’s eleventh-hour attempts to inject $8.6\n\nmillion of claimed “harms” into the case. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held,\n\nthe trial court properly instructed the jury on the no-damages-for-delay exceptions,\n\nincluding recklessness. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding\n\n\n                                        24\n\fZachry pleaded apparent authority, and its instruction was proper. And PHA is not\n\nentitled to attorneys’ fees so long as the judgment awards Zachry damages.\n\nFinally, PHA’s attempt to deny Zachry pass-through recovery for the work of its\n\nsubcontractor—a    Zachry entity created     during   corporate   restructuring—\n\ncontravenes Interstate Contracting v. City of Dallas, 135 S.W.3d 605, 610 (Tex.\n\n2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                       25\n\f                                  ARGUMENT\n\nI.    Ample evidence supports the jury’s breach-of-contract findings.\n      PHA contends the Contract and CO4 unambiguously authorized PHA to\n\nissue the R&R Order barring Zachry’s freeze-wall means and methods. But PHA\n\nfails to “consider the entire writing and…harmonize and give effect to all the\n\nprovisions….” Frost Nat’l Bank v. L&F Distrib’rs, 165 S.W.3d 310, 312 (Tex.\n\n2005). Nor does PHA “construe [the] contract[] from a utilitarian standpoint\n\nbearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served.” Id. PHA also\n\nignores that specific provisions control over general. See McCreary v. Bay Area\n\nBank & Trust, 68 S.W.3d 727, 731-32 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet.\n\ndism’d).\n\n      Applying these principles, there is only one reasonable interpretation: PHA\n\nhad no right to issue the R&R Order.         At a minimum, Zachry’s reading is\n\nreasonable, and ample evidence supported the jury findings in Questions 1 and 2.\n\n      A.    Section 5.10 prohibited PHA’s R&R Order, and no other\n            Contract provision authorized it.\n\n            1.     Section 5.10 forbids PHA control of Zachry’s means and\n                   methods.\n      Section 5.10 plainly barred PHA from controlling Zachry’s means and\n\nmethods, which undisputedly included the frozen-cutoff wall. See p.4. It stated,\n\n“[PHA] shall not have the right to control the manner in which or prescribe the\n\n\n                                        26\n\fmethod by which the Contractor performs the Work,” and that Zachry was “an\n\nindependent Contractor…solely responsible for the supervision and performance of\n\nthe Work…in such manner, using such methods as Contractor shall choose.”\n\nDX1-1.0214(A13).\n\n      This prohibition on PHA control was not “subject to” the “proviso” at the\n\nend of §5.10, PHASupp:1: it merely clarified that Zachry’s right to choose its\n\nmethods did not eliminate its obligation to comply with the Contract. DX1-1.0214,\n\n§5.10(A13) (“…provided, however…the order, time, manner and methods of\n\nprosecution shall be…in accordance with the Contract Documents”). When the\n\nR&R Order was issued, Zachry was in compliance with the Contract; PHA does\n\nnot argue otherwise.\n\n      As discussed below, some Contract provisions allowed PHA to receive\n\nmeans-and-methods-related submittals.        However, none authorized PHA to\n\nexercise control over Zachry’s methods by barring Zachry from using them and\n\nordering Zachry to revise them. Arguing these clauses granted PHA such control\n\nfails to harmonize all Contract provisions and renders §5.10’s prohibition on PHA\n\ncontrol meaningless. It also vitiates PHA’s business purpose: “insulating [PHA]\n\nfrom liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising control over\n\nZachry’s work.” 449 S.W.3d at 102 & n.4(A3); see pp.4-5. Finally, PHA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\fargument improperly gives controlling weight to general provisions relating to\n\nsubmittals, like §5.22, rather than specific provisions, like §5.10.\n\n             2.     Section 4.07 forbids PHA control over Zachry’s health-and-\n                    safety plans.\n      Contract §4.07 required Zachry to submit a health-and-safety plan to PHA,\n\nbut made clear PHA could not control it:\n\n      Notwithstanding the Chief Engineer’s review of the health and safety\n      plan, the Contractor, and not the Port Authority, shall be responsible\n      for and have control over ensuring the safety of its personnel and its\n      Subcontractors…\n\nDX1-1.0204(A13).\n\n      Zachry agreed to submit the main freeze-wall design as a shoring-safety-\n\nplan addendum to its previously filed health-and-safety plan, “in accord[] with\n\nTechnical Specification [‘T.S.’]02161(1.3)” and “conforming to OSHA standards,\n\nwith a statement signed and sealed by a registered Professional Engineer licensed\n\nin…Texas.” PX86; see DX1-1.0325, §1.3(A14); PX93.0007; 21:78; 6:60.\n\n      T.S.02161 required the shoring-safety plan to include details about the\n\nContractor’s means and methods but did not authorize PHA to control them. DX1-\n\n1.0325, §1.3(A14).     Nor could it: T.S.02161 was expressly “[s]ubject to the\n\nGeneral and Special Conditions,” which included §5.10 and §4.07. DX1-1.0324,\n\n§1.1(A14). Instead of PHA approval, T.S.02161 required Zachry to obtain a Texas\n\nPE’s approval. Id. The purpose of this review was to ensure the shoring plan\n\n\n                                          28\n\fsatisfied OSHA safety rules, so the wall would not harm workers; as PHA\n\nwitnesses testified, it did not allow PHA to approve or reject the wall based on any\n\npurported effect on the wharf. 6:62-67; 7:62; 20:111; 27:19-21; 37:106-07. The\n\nTexas PE’s approval ensured PHA would not be liable for Zachry’s activities.\n\n44:90.\n\n         Consistent with §4.07 and §5.10, PHA did not “approve” the original freeze-\n\nwall design, but rather “accepted [it] for records” based on the Texas PE’s\n\ncertification. 37:115-16, 120-21; 37:114-16; 38:5-6, 156-57; 44:100-01, 109-11;\n\n45:32; PX88(A19). PHA’s witnesses testified PHA did not approve or reject the\n\noriginal freeze-wall or safety submittals to avoid claims it controlled Zachry’s\n\nmethods and any attendant liability. 37:115; 44:95-97. No one contemplated PHA\n\ncould approve or order Zachry to revise its main freeze-wall plan: Zachry built it\n\nand installed freeze-pipes before giving PHA the design. 44:110-11.\n\n               3.    None of PHA’s other cited provisions authorize the R&R\n                     Order.\n         Section 5.22. Although §5.22 allowed PHA to “review” Submittals “to\n\ndetermine whether Contractor is complying with…the Contract Documents,” it did\n\nnot authorize PHA to control Zachry’s means and methods—contrary to §5.10—by\n\nrejecting them.\n\n         Consistent with §5.10 and §4.07, §5.22 specifically forbade PHA to approve\n\nZachry’s safety plan or means and methods: “The Port Authority’s…review and\n\n                                          29\n\facceptance of the Contractor’s Submittals shall not constitute approval of safety\n\nprecautions or any construction means, methods….” DX1-1.0220(A13); 6:70-71.\n\nThus, §5.22 insulated PHA from liability for Zachry’s methods. 6:57, 71.\n\n      In contrast, §5.22 did not disclaim PHA’s right to approve Submittals\n\nrelating to matters PHA was authorized to control under the Contract: Submittals\n\nrelating to the “Work.” Section 5.22 required Zachry to provide submittals to\n\nPHA’s Design Consultant, DMJM, “showing all materials and details of Work to\n\nbe incorporated into the Project.” DX1-1.0218(A13). “Work” was defined as “the\n\nconstruction” and “services” “required by the Contract” or “pursuant to the\n\nContract.” DX1-1.0190, §1.42. Thus, the wharf and any contractually specified\n\nmeans and methods—for example, the Technical Specification requiring a\n\nparticular method for vibrating concrete pours—would be part of the “Work” and\n\nsubject to PHA approval. 6:47, 53-55; 9:36-37; 21:33; DX1-10430. This ensured\n\nthe permanent Work (wharf) was built according to the Contract specifications.\n\n6:58-59; 8:11.\n\n      In contrast, Zachry’s chosen means and methods—the freeze-walls—were\n\nnot required by the Contract, 20:96; 37:66, 99; 44:78, would not be part of the\n\nWork, 21:33, 63; 27:11, and would not be required Submittals under this clause,\n\n6:54-57, 59, 74-75; 21:71-73; 37:99. In August 2004, Thiess confirmed this:\n\n“[r]egarding the freeze wall, we have no requirement for a submittal as it was not\n\n\n                                       30\n\fanticipated by the designers.” PX84(A18). PHA’s designer refused to approve any\n\nfreeze-wall, because it was Zachry’s means and methods. 20:110-11; 44:95;\n\nPX93.0007.    Submittals relating to Zachry’s safety plan and methods were\n\ncontrolled by §5.22’s prohibition on PHA approval.\n\n      T.S.01500. Although T.S.01500 required Zachry to protect the Work, it did\n\nnot authorize the R&R Order. DX1-1.0271, §1.1A(A15); 27:29-30. T.S.01500\n\nwas “[s]ubject to the General and Special Conditions,” DX1-1.0271, §1.1A(A15);\n\nsee DX1-1.0191, §2.02(a)(A13), including §5.10’s bar on PHA control, and §4.07\n\nand §5.22’s prohibition of PHA approval of Zachry’s safety plans and methods.\n\nConsistent with PHA’s goal of avoiding liability, T.S.01500 required Zachry to fix\n\nany damage “done by, or on account of...the Contractor.” DX1-1.0278,\n\n§1.11A.4(A15). PHA’s argument grants PHA control, destroying this protection.\n\n      Section 1.39. Nothing in §1.39 authorized PHA to order Zachry to revise\n\nZachry’s means and methods. It defined “Submittals” as “information provided\n\nby [Zachry] for approval of proposed Equipment, Materials, means or methods.”\n\nDX1-1.0189(A13). Critically, §5.22 prohibited PHA from approving Zachry’s\n\nmeans and methods (as opposed to contractually specified methods). See pp.29-\n\n31. Thus, any submission of Zachry’s methods was not “information provided by\n\n[Zachry] for approval.” And reading §1.39’s general “Submittal” definition to\n\nauthorize the R&R Order improperly allows §1.39 to control over §5.10 and\n\n\n                                       31\n\f§4.07’s specific prohibitions on PHA control.\n\n            4.     PHA is not remediless.\n      PHA contends Zachry’s argument deprives PHA of any recourse if PHA\n\nbelieved Zachry’s means and methods “could cause the Wharf to collapse.”\n\nPHASupp:25.      Even if such a belief could authorize the R&R Order, ample\n\nevidence established PHA did not actually or reasonably believe the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall could cause wharf collapse. See pp.13-15.\n\n      Furthermore, the Contract contains numerous provisions allocating to\n\nZachry the risk of damage from Zachry’s methods and providing PHA a remedy.\n\nSee, e.g., DX1-1.0198, .0200, .0223, .0229, .0234, §§ 3.06, 3.08, 5.36, 5.53,\n\n6.14(A13); DX1-1.0278, §1.11A.4(A15); 9:33-35; 27:13-18, 23-25. And if PHA\n\nwere truly concerned about wharf collapse, it could terminate the Contract without\n\ncause. DX1-1.0227, §5.47(A13). The one thing the Contract did not allow PHA\n\nto do was control Zachry’s means and methods by issuing the R&R Order. PHA\n\ndrafted the Contract, pp.3-4, and the Court should not rewrite it to grant PHA\n\nrights omitted from it and contrary to PHA’s business purpose.\n\n            5.     The drilled-shaft submittal is consistent with Zachry’s\n                   reading.\n      PHA suggests Zachry’s drilled-shaft submittal shows PHA’s right to issue\n\nthe R&R Order. PHASupp:2. But it related only to piers—which were part of the\n\n“Work,” which PHA had the right to approve—not Zachry’s freeze-wall methods,\n\n                                        32\n\fwhich PHA had no right to approve. See PX6; PX69; 7:45; pp.26-32. PHA\n\nrecognized this, warning “any ice…encountered during drilled-shaft construction\n\nwill be cause for rejecting the affected work”—not Zachry’s freeze-wall methods.\n\nDX133.002\n\n         B.    PHA’s R&R Order breached CO4.\n\n         PHA argues CO4 did not “delete PHA’s §5.22 right to require Zachry to\n\nrevise and resubmit Zachry’s frozen-COW design.” PHASupp:25. But §5.22\n\nafforded no such right. See pp.29-31.\n\n         Even if PHA had such a right, ample evidence supported the jury’s finding\n\nthat PHA agreed in CO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall, and CO4\n\ncontrols. DX1-1.0191, §2.02(a)(A13).\n\n         CO4 incorporated “Proposer’s Specifications and Proposal dated April 13,\n\n2005, as amended by Proposals for 330 feet Wharf Extension [the May 18\n\nproposal, 26:110-12] and as further amended by Proposer’s Supplemental Proposal\n\ndated July 11, 2005….”          PX12.0001, .0004(A30).       Both the April and May\n\nproposals were conditioned on an “[u]ninterrupted work schedule” and the “freeze\n\nwall-cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling”—the same one described\n\nto PHA representatives on April 5 and memorialized in the September 9 design.\n\nPX9(A21); PX179(A22); pp.8, 11. 6 The July 11 proposal did not delete these\n\n\n6\n    PHA’s claim it rejected the April 13 proposal is immaterial. The May 18 proposal—which\n                                             33\n\fconditions: it was merely a “[s]upplemental proposal” that offered “additions and\n\nclarifications.” PX219(A23); 8:60; 10:116. PHA signed CO4 after reviewing the\n\nSeptember 9 design—which embodied the April 5 design described in the\n\nproposals—for two weeks. 10:111-16, 118, 8:50-51; 22:92, 119-20; 27:37; 45:148;\n\np.13. 7     Thus, CO4 included PHA’s agreement that Zachry could use the frozen-\n\ncutoff wall. See pp.12-13.\n\n          PHA concedes CO4 is at least ambiguous as to Zachry’s right to use the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall, but argues there is “no intent evidence.” PHASupp:27. CO4’s\n\nlanguage incorporating the April and May proposals refutes this. Furthermore,\n\nZachry’s Anderson testified CO4 “included language with the frozen-cutoff wall”\n\nand “expressly said that we had the right to use it as a result of this change order.”\n\n15:61. PHA cites nothing for its argument CO4 did not bind the parties if it\n\nauthorized, but did not require, Zachry to use the frozen-cutoff wall.\n\n          Thus, the evidence supports the jury’s finding that CO4 authorized Zachry to\n\nuse the frozen-cutoff wall. PHA does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nof breach under this interpretation to support Question 1, because it cannot. See\n\npp.15-16.\n\nPHA does not claim was rejected—was also conditioned on the frozen-cutoff wall.\nPX179(A22). Furthermore, PHA cites nothing holding a previously rejected proposal cannot be\nincorporated into an agreement.\n7\n PHA’s irrelevant claim that Zachry changed its theory on CO4 is disproved by PHA’s citations.\nCR31:8541; 1(9/11/09):27, 80.\n\n                                             34\n\f       C.     Question 1 was proper.\n\n       The instruction in Question 1 that the jury was “not being asked to decide\n\nwhether PHA failed to comply with §5.10” was necessary to obtain separate\n\nfindings on whether CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the frozen-cutoff wall\n\n(Question 1) and whether §5.10 barred PHA from issuing the R&R Order\n\n(Question 2). CR59:17390(A4). The instruction was within the court’s broad\n\ndiscretion. Kiefer v. Continental Air., 10 S.W.3d 34, 37 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1999, pet. denied).\n\n       Any error was harmless. The jury found PHA breached §5.10 in Question 2;\n\nthus, deleting the instruction from Question 1 would not have changed anything.\n\nSee id. at 38; Shupe v. Lingafelter, 192 S.W.3d 577, 579-80 (Tex. 2006).8\n\nII.    The jury's verdict on causation and damages is supported by the\n       evidence.\n       Given the evidence that PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall, demands\n\nfor a recovery schedule, and threats of LDs caused Zachry to switch to working in\n\nthe wet, pp.16-21, the remaining issue was the quantification of the effect of the\n\nswitch (damages). 51:152-54; 52:4-10. Zachry’s damages expert, Gary Draper,\n\ntestified about that quantification; he did not also need to opine on the cause of the\n\nswitch. Id.; p.40.\n\n8\n  Question 1 should never have been submitted: CO4 unambiguously authorizes Zachry to use\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, pp.12-13, 33-34, and PHA does not dispute breach under this reading,\np.34. Zachry was entitled to a directed verdict. CR59:17299-313.\n\n                                            35\n\f      Draper (a) identified the construction activities the switch impacted; (b) as to\n\neach impacted activity, calculated the cost Zachry would have incurred absent\n\nPHA’s breach working in the dry as long as possible; (c) compared those costs to\n\nthe costs Zachry reasonably incurred as a result of switching to the wet earlier than\n\nit would have absent PHA’s breach; and (d) excluded all other costs. 52:4-10, 16,\n\n26, 72-74, 103-111; 117:172, 261. Draper calculated the costs of the switch (after\n\nexcluding other costs) to be approximately $27 million. 52:7-10, 110-11. After\n\nhearing the evidence, the jury awarded Zachry $18,602,697. CR59:17393(A4).\n\n      A.     Draper’s assumptions on damages were supported by the\n             evidence and did not vary materially from undisputed facts.\n      PHA incorrectly asserts the assumptions underlying Draper’s model failed to\n\ncomply with Burroughs Wellcome v. Crye, which holds that experts may not\n\n“assume[] facts that vary materially from the actual, undisputed facts.”          907\n\nS.W.2d 497, 499 (Tex. 1995).\n\n      PHA ignores the substantial evidence supporting Draper’s model, and\n\ninstead asserts Draper’s dry schedule “varies drastically” from “dozens of\n\nschedules Zachry prepared around the time of the” Port’s rejection. PHASupp:29.\n\nBut Draper scheduled a frozen-cutoff-wall methodology. 52:8. In contrast, the\n\nschedules PHA cites were not based on a frozen-cutoff wall, because they were\n\ncreated after the rejection. See PHASupp:29; p.19-20. Thus, these schedules did\n\nnot even attempt to project what Draper projected—a completion schedule using a\n\n                                         36\n\ffrozen-cutoff wall.    Moreover, because they were drafts, they did not reflect\n\nconcurrent performance of tasks to accurately project completion dates. 11:49-50,\n\n83-86; 18:124-25, 151-57; 19:32-60; p.19.\n\n      PHA’s other challenges to Draper’s assumptions—regarding freeze-pipe\n\nremoval and sheet-pile installation—ignore evidence supporting Draper’s\n\nassumptions and do not show his assumptions vary materially from undisputed\n\nevidence.\n\n               1.    Draper’s treatment of freeze-pipe removal was supported\n                     by the evidence.\n      PHA incorrectly asserts the “undisputed” evidence showed freeze-pipe\n\nremoval would occur prior to berm removal and in a manner that would add a\n\nmaterial amount of time to Draper’s overall dry schedule.\n\n      First, Draper’s dry model—consistent with the evidence—provided for\n\nfreeze-pipe removal to occur concurrently with berm removal. 53:31-32; PX320;\n\n30:106-08, 116-17.\n\n            • Zachry’s dry approach was to remove the berm and freeze-pipes\n\n               simultaneously and using the same equipment.      53:31-32; 10:61;\n\n               DX404.004.\n\n            • PHA’s own freeze-wall expert at trial, Mageau, concluded at the time\n\n               of the R&R Order that Zachry could remove the freeze-pipes and\n\n               perform the remainder of the work by mid-February to mid-March\n\n                                         37\n\f             2006 so the crane-ship could timely dock—even though he was aware\n\n             of freeze-pipe issues and other challenges Zachry faced.    PX320;\n\n             30:106-08, 116-17; pp.18-19.\n\n           • Draper’s schedule was consistent with the contemporaneous frozen-\n\n             cutoff-wall project schedule created by Zachry shortly before the\n\n             rejection. DX404; 18:115-18, 124.\n\n      Second, even if freeze-pipe removal would occur separately from berm\n\nremoval, it would account for no more than one day of the critical path of the\n\nschedule: the day after pipe-removal started, Zachry would begin the more time-\n\nconsuming critical-path activity of berm removal where the pipes had been\n\nremoved.      After the first day, pipe and berm removal would proceed\n\nsimultaneously. 53:29-30. Draper included sufficient “float” to accommodate this.\n\nId.; 54:91-93.\n\n      PHA incorrectly characterizes Draper’s testimony as “assum[ing] a thousand\n\nfreeze-pipes could be removed in one day.” PHASupp:31 (emphasis original).\n\nPHA’s suggestion that Draper should have scheduled more than one day to remove\n\npipes incorrectly assumes that pipe and berm removal could not occur\n\nconcurrently. See, e.g., 53:31-32; 10:61; DX404.004.\n\n      Third, PHA cross-examined Draper on this point, and the jury’s award––\n\nsubstantially less than Zachry sought––accounted for any weight the jury gave it.\n\n                                       38\n\f53:29-32; America’s Favorite Chicken Co. v. Samaras, 929 S.W.2d 617, 629\n\n(Tex.App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied).\n\n              2.     Draper’s treatment of sheet-pile installation was supported\n                     by the evidence.\n       PHA contends “it is undisputed…Zachry was not ready to install…sheet pile\n\nuntil after November 15—40 days later than Draper assumed.” PHASupp:31. 9\n\nBut PHA’s citations provide no support.          PHA relies on Anderson’s testimony\n\nreferencing a November 15 list of remaining tasks. Neither that list nor\n\nAnderson’s testimony references sheet-pile-installation timing for the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, because it was rejected a month earlier. See DX91; 16:29-31; 14:93-104.\n\nPHA nevertheless inserts “frozen” into Anderson’s testimony “that there was work\n\nto be done before we were ready for the [frozen] cutoff wall.” PHASupp:31. But\n\nAnderson was discussing the status as of November 15—when Zachry was\n\nconsidering the alternate-cutoff wall’s viability. See p.19-20. PHA’s argument\n\nincorrectly   assumes      that,   after   PHA's     October    11    rejection,    Zachry\n\nproceeded exactly as if PHA had not breached. See, e.g., 16:135-36; 54:91.\n\n       Even if Anderson was saying work remained as of October 11, Anderson\n\ntestified it would take “a couple of days at best.” 14:103; see 16:30. Although\n\nDraper’s schedules showed sheet-pile installation starting October 7, it was on\n\n9\n  “Sheet pile”—steel sheets—would have lined the frozen-cutoff wall berm and would have\ncomposed Mageau’s alternate-cutoff wall. 10:21-22; 11:52-53.\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\f“early start,” meaning it could start later with no impact on his analysis. 53:159-\n\n60; 54:91-94; PX580 at 273. Indeed, his schedule’s float allowed sheet-pile\n\ninstallation to be delayed until November 15 or later. Id. The evidence supports\n\nDraper’s assumption that—absent the breach—Zachry could have accomplished\n\npre-freeze-down work like sheet-pile installation in time to freeze-down the walls\n\nand complete Milestone-A before the crane-ship arrived. See pp.18-19; 52:14-15.\n\n      Third, PHA raised this issue during Anderson’s cross-examination, and the\n\njury’s award––less than Zachry sought––accounted for any weight the jury gave it.\n\n16:29-31; Samaras, 929 S.W.2d at 629.\n\n      B.    The evidence establishes causation.\n            1.     Ample evidence supported the jury’s causation finding.\n      Contrary to PHA’s assertion, expert testimony was not required to prove\n\nPHA’s breach caused Zachry to abandon its dry-construction methodology. See\n\nHelena Chemical Co. v. Wilkins, 47 S.W.3d 486, 504 (Tex. 2001) (non-expert\n\ntestimony may establish causation, exclude alternative causes).\n\n      Abundant evidence supported the jury’s finding that PHA’s rejection of the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall caused Zachry to switch to a wet-construction methodology.\n\nSee pp.16-21. Anderson and geotechnical expert Hugh Lacy testified that—in the\n\nface of PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall—Zachry had no viable\n\nalternative-cutoff wall to bifurcate the project and complete the wharf in the dry\n\n\n                                        40\n\fwhile still allowing the crane-ship to dock, and thus had to switch to the wet far\n\nearlier than it otherwise would have. 19:32-50; 42:59-104; p.19-20.10\n\n             2.     PHA’s “Contract completion deadline” argument fails.\n      PHA asserts Draper did not opine that Zachry could have met the Contract\n\ndeadlines by working in the dry with the frozen-cutoff wall. PHASupp:34-35. But\n\nZachry was not required to show it would have completed all its work in the dry by\n\nthe Contract deadlines to prove the R&R Order caused Zachry’s damages. The\n\njury could have reasonably found a causal connection between PHA’s breach and\n\nthe damages awarded based on evidence showing PHA’s breach caused Zachry to\n\nuse a wet approach for a far greater portion of the work than if Zachry had been\n\nallowed to use the frozen-cutoff wall. 52:41-43, 94-97, 102-07; p.17-18; Abraxis\n\nPetrol Corp. v. Hornburg, 20 S.W.3d 741, 758 (Tex.App.—El Paso 2000, no pet.).\n\nDraper calculated that increased cost, 52:110-11, and excluded the cost of work\n\nZachry would have performed in the wet even with the frozen-cutoff wall, 52:41-\n\n43, 94-98; 10:59-62. PHA’s contention that Zachry failed to prove causation\n\nbecause Draper’s model assumed a small amount of work in the wet is unfounded.\n\n      But even if required, Zachry presented ample evidence it would have\n\ncompleted Milestone-A in the dry by February 15, 2006, if PHA had not rejected\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall. See, e.g., PX320; 30:115-16; PX357; 19:43-45; 18:107-11;\n10\n   PHA’s argument that Zachry’s schedules showed Zachry finishing faster and cheaper by\nabandoning its dry methodology was debunked at trial. See pp.19-20, 36-37.\n\n                                          41\n\f32:100-01; PX893.0055; PX251; PX252; 26:100-02; 45:103-05; see also 29:35-36,\n\n115-16; 123-24; pp.18-19. 11 Other evidence showed that absent PHA’s breach,\n\nZachry could have completed Milestone-A by May 15, 2006—the crane-ship’s\n\nactual arrival date, see, e.g., id.; 56:96-97; pp.18-19,—and achieved final\n\ncompletion by the Contract deadline, 16:102-04; PX771; 19:86-90; 18:115-18;\n\n27:40-42; 35:57-58.        PHA ignores this evidence and that Draper adopted a\n\nconservative approach in preparing his analysis. 52:60-63.\n\n               3.     PHA’s “alternative cause” argument fails.\n       PHA incorrectly argues Draper “failed to rule out alternative causes of\n\nZachry’s switch to working ‘in the wet.’” PHASupp:33. Expert testimony was not\n\nrequired to rule out alternative causes. See p.40.\n\n       PHA’s suggestion Zachry was planning on eliminating the freeze-wall was\n\nrefuted by evidence establishing that, until the R&R Order, Zachry intended to use\n\nthe freeze-walls and was building the wharf and freeze-walls consistent with that\n\nintent. See 10:99-102, 118, 124; 19:33; 35:63. Anderson testified that in the\n\nabsence of an alternative-cutoff wall, Zachry’s only option was to work in the wet.\n\n18:151-57; 19:32-50; see also pp.17, 19-21. And geotechnical expert Lacy offered\n\nunrebutted expert testimony that the alternative-cutoff wall design was not safe or\n\n11\n   Anderson also testified about scheduling and construction progress in light of his construction\nexperience and first-hand observation of the work. 9:81-86, 94, 101-02, 109-110; 11:49-50, 82-\n86, 91-93; 12:111; 18:64-65, 115-25, 151-57; 19:32-76. Anderson testified Zachry would have\ntimely completed the project with the frozen-cutoff wall. 19:43-45.\n\n                                               42\n\ffeasible. 42:59-104. The jury could reasonably have found that—in the absence of\n\na viable alternative method to bifurcate construction and allow the crane-ship to\n\ndock—PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall, demands that Zachry comply\n\nwith the Contract deadlines, and threats of LDs forced Zachry to switch to a\n\npredominantly wet methodology earlier than it otherwise would have. See pp.16-\n\n21.\n\n         Finally, PHA’s argument that Anderson offered conclusory testimony lacks\n\nmerit.        Anderson was questioned for days regarding scheduling options he\n\nanalyzed after PHA’s breach.        See, e.g., 11:49-50, 83-86; 18:124-25, 151-57;\n\n19:32-45, 50-60. Anderson’s contemporaneously prepared schedules showed that,\n\nwithout a frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry could only dock the crane-ship if it moved to\n\nwet construction far earlier than planned. Id.\n\n         C.      PHA’s lack-of-authority argument does not defeat causation.\n         PHA contends that because “Thiess had no authority [under Special\n\nCondition §12(d)] to change Contract terms, Thiess’s R&R response could\n\nnot…have caused Zachry’s R&R damages.” PHASupp:38-39. However, §12(d) is\n\ninapplicable: the R&R Order was not a change to the Contract, but a breach. Cf.\n\np.45-48.\n\n         Furthermore, PHA’s argument is based on the incorrect premise that “Thiess\n\nissued the R&R response.” PHASupp:37.            The R&R Order, which bore PHA’s\n\n                                          43\n\fseal, was PHA’s decision and act; Thiess (with PHA’s McQueen) was simply\n\nPHA’s messenger. 8:16; 46:50-51, 53-54; PX266(A33); PX314(A34); DX1-\n\n1.0244, §12(c)(A16). The day before the R&R Order issued, PHA’s McQueen\n\ntold Thiess and Ely, “[t]he cutoff wall was rejected.” PX1(A32).          Vincent\n\nconcurred. 46:39.\n\n      But even if Thiess made the R&R-Order decision, it would still have been\n\nPHA’s act. Chief Engineer DeWolf testified he delegated his §5.22 authority to\n\nreview safety-related Submittals to PHA’s Vincent and McQueen, who were\n\nresponsible for getting CH2M-Hill’s assistance. 8:16. Apparent authority is a fact\n\nissue. See p.62.\n\n      Moreover, other PHA acts caused Zachry’s damages. Three days after the\n\nR&R Order’s issuance, Chief Engineer DeWolf sent Zachry a letter demanding\n\nZachry finish by the Contract deadlines (which were conditioned on use of the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall) and threatening LDs. PX319; 19:29-31. DeWolf’s superiors\n\nrepeated this demand in October and November. See p.17. By demanding a\n\nrecovery schedule after barring Zachry from using its “required” frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, PHA—not Thiess—forced Zachry to spend more money and time building\n\nthe newly extended wharf in the wet. See pp.17-18, 21-22.\n\n      The Water Code and Chapter 271 impose no bar: the Contract PHA\n\nbreached was undisputedly written and properly executed as required by PHA’s\n\n\n                                       44\n\fcited statutes. See PHASupp:37-38 (citing TEX. WATER CODE §60.408(i); TEX.\n\nLOC. GOV’T CODE §§271.151(2), 271.152)(A42).\n\nIII.   Sections 5.41 and 5.42 do not bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim.\n\n       A.    The “changes” clauses are inapplicable by their terms.\n       By their plain terms, §5.41 and §5.42 do not apply to breach-of-contract\n\nclaims for damages. Instead, they set forth procedures allowing PHA to make\n\nchanges within the scope of the Work during performance of the Contract, either\n\nthrough     Change   Orders    (§5.41)   or    “Changed   Conditions    or    Contract\n\nInterpretations” (§5.42).\n\n       Section 5.41 applies to “changes and modifications to the Contract\n\nDocuments within the general scope of the Work,” and requires a Change Order to\n\n“stipulate the Work to be performed” and “any difference in the Contract Price.”\n\nDX1-1.0224-25(A13).         Similarly, §5.42 requires five days’ notice of any\n\n“interpretation of the Contract” by PHA “the Contractor believes...constitutes a\n\nchange to the Contract,” “[i]f the Contractor believes it is entitled to an adjustment\n\nin the Contract Time [or] Contract Price.”         DX1-1.0225(A13).          The Chief\n\nEngineer’s determination as to whether there should be a “modification” or\n\n“equitable adjustment” is “final and conclusive,” and the Contractor is forbidden to\n\n“begin performing that portion of the Work affected by such interpretation” before\n\ngiving notice. Id.\n\n\n                                          45\n\f        Zachry does not assert that in forbidding Zachry to use the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, PHA effected “changes or modifications to the Contract Documents within\n\nthe general scope of the Work” as in §5.41, or that PHA made an “interpretation\n\nof the Contract” that “constitutes a change to the Contract” as in §5.42. Rather,\n\nPHA breached the Contract and CO4 by rejecting the frozen-cutoff wall. Thus,\n\nZachry never sought the “difference in the Contract Price” under §5.41 nor “an\n\nadjustment in the...Contract Price” under §5.42. Rather, Zachry sought—and the\n\njury properly awarded—damages for PHA’s breach of the Contract. CR29:08142-\n\n44(A8); CR59:17390-93(A4). Furthermore, §§5.41/5.42 apply only to changes\n\nrelating to “the Work,” which does not include Zachry’s means and methods. See\n\np.30.\n\n        Authorities recognize that “changes” clauses like §§5.41/5.42 do not apply\n\nto claims the owner breached and is liable for damages. See, e.g., Shintech, Inc. v.\n\nGroup Constructors, Inc., 688 S.W.2d 144, 151-52 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 1985, no writ) (delay damages recoverable despite “changes” clause); Board\n\nof Regents v. S&G Constr. Co., 529 S.W.2d 90, 97 (Tex.Civ.App.—Austin 1975,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.). Instead, “changes” clauses are a “vehicle to add or delete work,\n\nsubstitute materials, alter geographic locations, increase or decrease quantities,\n\nextend or reduce contract time and adjust contract price....” 1 BRUNER &\n\nO’CONNOR CONSTR. LAW §4.23.           They “necessarily exclude[] the power to\n\n\n                                        46\n\funilaterally change the terms of the contract or its general risk-allocation\n\nprovisions, as distinguished from the work itself.” Id. §4:23.\n\n       For example, §5.42 would apply if the specifications required “steel,” and\n\nPHA interpreted that to mean galvanized steel, but Zachry believed black steel\n\ncomplied. RR16:62. But §5.42 would not allow PHA to unilaterally change the\n\nContract’s General Conditions precluding PHA from interfering with Zachry’s\n\nmethods or CO4’s frozen-cutoff-wall authorization.\n\n       S&G rejected the owner’s argument that the contractor could recover for\n\nbreach only under the change-order provision, holding the argument ignored the\n\ndifference between (1) suits seeking breach-of-contract damages and (2) suits\n\nseeking additional compensation in the absence of a breach. 529 S.W.2d at 96-97.\n\n“Changes” clauses apply only to (2), and S&G distinguished cases (cited by PHA)\n\napplying “changes” clauses, finding there was no breach in those cases.        Id.\n\n(distinguishing State v. Martin Bros., 160 S.W.2d 58 (Tex. 1942); State v. F&C\n\nEng’g Co., 438 S.W.2d 647 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1969, writ ref’d\n\nn.r.e.)).\n\n       PHA’s reading also improperly fails to construe §§5.41/5.42 in light of the\n\nentire contract. Frost, 165 S.W.3d at 312. PHA knew how to write a condition\n\nprecedent to filing a lawsuit, but did not in §§5.41/5.42. DX1-1.0230, §5.55(A13).\n\nFurthermore, according to PHA, every PHA breach would be a “change” PHA’s\n\n\n                                         47\n\fChief        Engineer    had    the   right        to   make   under   §5.41    or   an\n\n“interpretation...constituting a change” for which the Chief Engineer was the final\n\narbiter under §5.42. Zachry could never recover damages, because its remedy\n\nwould be a “claim for compensation” calculated under §5.43. DX1-1.0225-26,\n\n§5.43(A13).          PHA’s reading fails to give meaning to other contract clauses\n\nrecognizing PHA could have liability under the contract not only for a “claim for\n\ncompensation” but also a “claim for damages.”              DX1-1.0192, §2.03(A13); see\n\nDX1-1.0217, §5.16(A13); DX1-1.0217, §5.19(A13).\n\n        At a minimum, Zachry’s reading of §§5.41/5.42 as inapplicable to breach-\n\nof-contract claims is reasonable. Any ambiguity should be construed against PHA\n\nas the drafter. See S&G, 529 S.W.2d at 99; p.3-4. Furthermore, “forfeiture by\n\nfinding a condition precedent is to be avoided when another reasonable reading…\n\nis possible.” Criswell v. European Crossroads Shopping Ctr., 792 S.W.2d 945,\n\n948 (Tex. 1990). Even if ambiguous, §§5.41/5.42 should be construed not to\n\nimpose a condition precedent to breach-of-contract recovery.\n\n        B.      Alternatively, common-law and statutory                rules   preclude\n                application of the “changes” clauses here.\n\n                1.      The Shintech doctrine.\n\n        Even if §§5.41/5.42 apply to breach-of-contract claims, the trial court\n\ncorrectly held that they do not bar Zachry’s claim. “[W]hen an owner breaches a\n\nconstruction contract, it relinquishes its contractual procedural rights concerning\n\n                                              48\n\fchange orders and claims for additional costs.” Shintech, 688 S.W.2d at 151. This\n\nCourt and others have held Shintech precludes breaching owners like PHA from\n\ninvoking procedural clauses to bar contractors’ claims. See, e.g., Shintech, 688\n\nS.W.2d at 151 (written-notice requirement); West v. Triple B Servs., LLP, 264\n\nS.W.3d 440, 446-47 & n.4, 449-50 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no writ)\n\n(30-day notice requirement); North Harris Cty. Jr. College Dist. v. Fleetwood\n\nConstr. Co., 604 S.W.2d 247, 254 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1980, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.) (change-order requirement); S&G, 529 S.W.2d at 96 (same).\n\n                   a.    Green does not preclude application of Shintech.\n      PHA’s argument that Shintech does not apply if the contractor continued to\n\nperform after the breach is incorrect: in the cases above, the contractors continued\n\nto perform after defendants’ breaches.\n\n      Nor does Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997),\n\nsupport PHA. In Green, the general contractor asserted the subcontractor’s lien\n\nreleases barred its claim for extra work. Id. at 388. The Supreme Court disagreed,\n\nbut for a different reason than the Court of Appeals, which had characterized the\n\nquestion as a Shintech problem—whether the general contractor relinquished\n\nprocedural rights by breaching. In dictum, the Supreme Court recognized the\n\nquestion in Green was instead whether “the remedy of excuse of performance”\n\napplied—that is, whether the breaching defendant was precluded from relying on\n\n\n                                         49\n\fits substantive right to a lien release to bar its subcontractor’s claims.       The\n\nSupreme Court did not address the Shintech rule. See id. at 389.\n\n      Green’s citation of Hanks v. GAB Bus. Servs., 644 S.W.2d 707 (Tex. 1982),\n\nconfirms the Court did not reject Shintech, but rather recognized its inapplicability\n\nto substantive contract rights.    Like Green, Hanks involved a nonbreaching\n\nplaintiff’s failure to perform a substantive requirement: the defendant-buyer of a\n\nbusiness asserted the plaintiff-seller’s breach of a covenant-not-to-compete\n\nexcused the buyer’s failure to pay the full price. 644 S.W.2d at 708. Hanks relied\n\non S&G to hold that the nonbreaching party’s performance was not excused\n\nbecause it continued to perform. Id. The Court did not disavow S&G’s application\n\nof the Shintech rule to procedural requirements. Compare id., with S&G, 529\n\nS.W.2d at 96.\n\n                   b.     Technip does not preclude application of Shintech.\n      Tennessee Gas Pipeline v. Technip USA Corp., 2008 WL 3876141\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2008, pet. denied), is distinguishable. It involved a\n\nprovision requiring the owner to give notice of defective work. Id. at *17. As the\n\nCourt observed, if the contractor’s alleged breach based on defective work excused\n\nthe owner from giving notice of defective work, the provision would never apply,\n\nrendering it “meaningless.” Id. at *23 n.11. The court did not disapprove but\n\ndistinguished cases—including Fleetwood—holding when an owner breaches a\n\n\n                                         50\n\fbuilding contract, it relinquishes procedural rights concerning change orders and\n\nadditional-cost claims. Id. Technip’s refusal to apply the Shintech rule turned not\n\non the fact that the provision required notice, but rather that applying the provision\n\nas the owner argued would require “circular reasoning” rendering it “without\n\neffect.” Id.\n\n      In contrast, applying Shintech here would not render §5.42 “without effect,”\n\nas it would still apply in the absence of a breach to differing Contract\n\ninterpretations relating to the Work when the contractor seeks an adjustment to the\n\nContract Price/Time. Indeed, this Court has applied Shintech to failures to comply\n\nwith notice provisions. See, e.g., p.49.\n\n               2.   The radical-change doctrine.\n      The trial court also concluded that §§5.41/5.42 are inapplicable to Zachry’s\n\nclaim by analogy to the radical-change doctrine. Under this doctrine, “changes”\n\nclauses do not apply to changes “requir[ing] contractors to perform large quantities\n\nof work, radically different in its character, nature, and cost from that originally\n\ncontemplated....” B.F.&C.M. Davis v. W.E. Callaghan Constr., 298 S.W. 273, 279\n\n(Tex.Comm’nApp. 1927). The trial court’s analogy did not turn Zachry’s claim\n\nfor breach of the written Contract into an implied-contract claim.         Besides, a\n\nradical change can constitute a breach giving rise to damages (not quantum\n\n\n\n\n                                           51\n\fmeruit). See Nat’l Env’l Serv. v. Homeplace Homes, 961 S.W.2d 632, 635 & n.3\n\n(Tex.App.—San Antonio 1998, no writ).\n\n             3.    Section §16.071.\n\n      According to PHA, §5.42 makes giving 5-days’ notice of Zachry’s breach-\n\nof-contract-damages claim a condition precedent to suit. However, any “contract\n\nstipulation that requires a claimant to give notice” “within less than 90 days” “of a\n\nclaim for damages as a condition precedent to the right to sue on the contract” is\n\n“void.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE §16.071(a)(A43); see Taber v. W. Union\n\nTele. Co., 137 S.W. 106, 109 (Tex. 1911); Atwood Oceanics v. Zust Bachmeier,\n\n2007 WL 2766192, *1 (5th Cir. 2007).\n\n      American Airlines Emp. Federal Credit Union v. Martin, 29 S.W.3d 86\n\n(Tex. 2000), is distinguishable.    That clause required a bank customer to give\n\nnotice of unauthorized signatures or be barred from asserting they were\n\nunauthorized. Id. at 91-92. In contrast, PHA argues §5.42 requires Zachry to give\n\n5-days’ notice of its breach-of-contract-damages claim and that failure to do so\n\nbars Zachry’s claim.    Plus, in PHA’s view, §5.42 gives PHA the “final and\n\nconclusive” right to decide the correct “interpretation” and thus whether there was\n\na breach. Unlike American, where the clause’s purpose was to inform the bank of\n\nunauthorized signatures, §5.42 (under PHA’s reading) has no purpose except to bar\n\n\n\n\n                                         52\n\fZachry’s breach-of-contract claim.12\n\n      C.     The “changes” clauses were not tried.\n\n      PHA asserts that whether Zachry complied with §§5.41/5.42 was tried to the\n\njury, that Zachry failed to prove that it obtained a change order or gave notice, and\n\nthat rendition is appropriate. However, Zachry’s compliance with these clauses\n\nwas expressly not tried, because the court held pre-trial that §§5.41/5.42 are\n\ninapplicable to Zachry’s claims. CR46:13299-301, 13305(A5). Zachry was not\n\nrequired to continue litigating these issues. Provident Life & Accident Ins. v.\n\nHazlitt, 216 S.W.2d 805, 807 (Tex. 1949). Although the jury was instructed that it\n\nmay consider §§5.41/5.42 for state of mind, it was not required. See, e.g., 49:112;\n\nCR59:17392(A4).13 Indeed, the jury was instructed Zachry was not required to\n\nobtain a §5.41 Change Order or give §5.42 notice. CR59:17392(A4). Zachry had\n\nno obligation to offer evidence on §§5.41/5.42. But if §5.42 notice was tried,\n\nZachry substantially complied.       See Aple.Br:61 n.54; 11:39-40; PX2(A35);\n\nPX314(A34); 27:89-90, 93-94; 35:95-96; p.16.\n\n\n\n\n12\n   PHA asserts the notice period should be reformed to 90 days under Contract §3.12.\nPHASupp:46 n.3. However, §3.12 is an unenforceable agreement to agree. Ft. Worth ISD v.\nCity of Ft. Worth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000); CR42:12179. PHA never sought\nreformation on any other basis.\n13\n   PHA notes the instruction also concerned §5.52. PHASupp:45 n.2. Zachry’s §§5.41/5.42\narguments apply equally to §5.52.\n\n                                          53\n\f      D.    If the trial court erred, remand—not rendition—is required.\n\n      Even if §§5.41/5.42 could reasonably be read to govern Zachry’s recovery of\n\nbreach-of-contract damages—which Zachry disputes—the proper remedy is not\n\nrendition, but rather remand to permit Zachry to offer evidence. County of Dallas\n\nv. Wiland, 216 S.W.3d 344, 357 (Tex. 2007). Zachry’s reading—that these clauses\n\ndo not apply to its damages claim for breach of §5.10/CO4—is at least one\n\nreasonable reading.   Accordingly, if not resolved by rules of construction in\n\nZachry’s favor, a jury should resolve this dispute.   Alternatively, a jury should\n\ndetermine whether Zachry substantially complied with §5.42. Finally, PHA must\n\nprove prejudice from any lack of notice. Prodigy Comms. Corp. v. Agricultural\n\nExcess & Surplus Ins., 288 S.W.3d 374, 377-78 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      E.    Zachry’s failure to seek a §5.08 extension was irrelevant.\n      Zachry’s failure to seek a §5.08 time extension for PHA’s breach was\n\nirrelevant: Zachry sought damages—not a time extension—for PHA’s breach.\n\nRequesting a §5.08 extension was not a prerequisite to damages.\n\n      Furthermore, §5.22 states, “revision and…resubmission of Submittals shall\n\nnot entitle…Contractor to any extension of time.” DX1-1.0219(A13). Zachry’s\n\nfailure to request an extension for PHA’s R&R Order thus proves nothing.\n\nAdditionally, any suggestion Zachry had to request an extension would have\n\ncaused unfair prejudice. TEX. R. CIV. P. 403. And PHA shows no harm.\n\n\n                                       54\n\fIV.   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding PHA’s $8.6\n      million in alleged harms claimed as offsets.\n      PHA asserts the trial court improperly “denied PHA its offset defense” by\n\nexcluding PHA’s evidence that it allegedly suffered $8.6 million in harms from\n\nZachry’s performance. PHASupp:50. Parties must timely disclose their theories\n\nof the case and amount of damages—for defenses as well as claims—or face\n\nmandatory exclusion. TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.1, 193.6, 194.2(c), (d) & cmt.; Alvarado\n\nv. Farah Mfg., 830 S.W.2d 911, 914 (Tex. 1992) (“The rule is mandatory, and its\n\nsole sanction—exclusion of evidence—is automatic….”); Harris Cty. v. Inter Nos,\n\nLtd., 199 S.W.3d 363, 367-68 (Tex.Civ.App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.)\n\n(litigant must disclose basis for contesting damages).     The interpretation of\n\npleadings and determination of the adequacy of disclosures are within the trial\n\ncourt’s discretion.   See Secure Comm. v. Anderson, 31 S.W.3d 428, 430 n.2\n\n(Tex.App.—Austin 2000, no pet.); Robinson v. Lubbering, 2011 WL 749197, *3, 7\n\n(Tex.App.—Austin 2011, no pet.).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding PHA’s alleged $8.6\n\nmillion in harms, because as shown below, PHA’s limited disclosures of alleged\n\nharms were made solely in connection with its attempt to prove the LD clauses\n\nwere reasonable forecasts of just compensation and thus enforceable. They did not\n\ngive Zachry notice that PHA intended to seek an $8.6 million jury finding on an\n\noffset defense to be deducted from Zachry’s damages award. An $8.6-million-\n\n                                       55\n\foffset claim would have required Zachry to conduct substantial discovery into\n\nwhether PHA sustained the harms, causation, and quantification.\n\n      From this suit’s beginning in 2006, Zachry sued for sums PHA wrongfully\n\nwithheld, including the $25,000/day LDs for Milestone-A.               CR1:00005;\n\nCR4:00934. When PHA disclosed—for the first time on June 3, 2009—that it\n\nsustained actual damages, its disclosure was solely in the context of arguing the\n\nLD provisions were a “reasonable forecast of just compensation because…the Port\n\nAuthority sustained actual damages in an amount that was not disproportionate to\n\nthe [LDs].” CR45:13023, ¶41(A9). The next day, PHA filed its Second Amended\n\nDisclosures stating PHA had suffered general categories of actual damages, but\n\nagain solely in the context of arguing the LD provisions were enforceable:\n\n       The difficulty of quantifying and proving…actual damages is\n       one…reason[] the parties included liquidated damages provisions in\n       the Contract…The [LD] provisions are enforceable….The [LDs]\n       were a reasonable forecast of just compensation because…[PHA]\n       sustained actual damages in an amount that is not disproportionate to\n       the [LDs] ….\n\nCR46:13076(A10).\n\n      Zachry immediately sent PHA an interrogatory on June 11 asking it to\n\nquantify these harms. CR46:13105(A11). That PHA responded by Zachry’s July\n\n24 deadline by quantifying more than $8 million in alleged actual harms does not\n\nhelp PHA: Zachry sent its interrogatory in response to PHA’s disclosure that it\n\nsuffered harm proportional to its LDs, and PHA’s response again referenced the\n                                        56\n\fdifficulty in “know[ing] the precise nature and extent of damages,” and did not\n\ndisclose it sought to offset them against Zachry’s damages. CR46:13108(A11);\n\nsee CR46:13105-10(A11). And PHA’s general, conclusory pleadings of an offset\n\ndefense failed to notify Zachry of the amount of damages PHA sought to offset.\n\nSee PHASupp:51 (citing CR47:13428, §57).\n\n      Even if these disclosures were not limited to LDs, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in excluding them as untimely. Trial had been scheduled to\n\nbegin July 20, 2009, and the discovery deadline had lapsed six months earlier, on\n\nJanuary 16. CR45:12933; CR17:04679. See Sprague v. Sprague, 363 S.W.3d 788,\n\n800 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied) (continuance does not\n\nnullify scheduling-order deadlines).\n\n      PHA later increased its claimed harms to approximately $10.5 million on\n\nSeptember 16, but continued to make this disclosure in the LD context.\n\nCR46:13117-20. Nothing disclosed PHA intended to submit these harms to the\n\njury as an offset defense to reduce Zachry’s damages. Indeed, PHA’s September\n\n17 draft charge did not seek any finding as to PHA’s actual damages for an offset\n\ndefense to reduce Zachry’s damages award. See CR43:12401-20(A12).\n\n      Not until the eve of trial did PHA reveal it intended to seek an $8.6 million\n\nalleged-harms offset as a defense to reduce Zachry’s damages. (10/9/09):19-21.\n\nThe trial court correctly ruled PHA disclosed the harms only in support of the LD\n\n\n                                        57\n\fprovision, not as an offset defense. CR51:14949-51(A6). It also correctly found\n\nPHA failed to show good cause and that injection of the $8.6 million in alleged\n\nharms would require extensive discovery and “dramatically change the landscape\n\nof what promises to be a lengthy and complicated trial.” CR51:14951-52(A6).\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nV.     PHA’s “open-the-door” theory did not support admission of PHA’s\n       alleged harms regarding the no-damages-for-delay exceptions.\n\n       A.    The trial court properly excluded PHA’s actual-harms evidence\n             under Rule 403.\n       PHA contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow PHA to prove—with\n\nrespect to the bad-faith and arbitrary-and-capricious no-damages-for-delay\n\nexceptions—that PHA suffered actual harm to rebut a purported “misimpression”\n\nZachry allegedly gave the jury. PHASupp:54-56.       But Zachry never opened the\n\ndoor to PHA’s claimed harm.\n\n       Zachry never argued PHA suffered no harm at all. Rather, Zachry argued\n\nPHA:\n\n       (1)   promised not to charge Milestone-A LDs if the crane-ship was able\n             to dock on arrival, but\n\n       (2)   nevertheless charged LDs even though the crane-ship was able to\n             dock on arrival.\n\nSee, e.g., 4:51; 25:61-62, 66-68; 71:98; p.10. Zachry did not argue PHA:\n\n       (1)   promised it would not charge LDs if it suffered no harm at all, but\n\n\n                                           58\n\f      (2)    charged LDs even though it suffered no harm.\n\n      At most Zachry opened the door to evidence the ship was not able to dock\n\non arrival—evidence that did not exist, as the ship was able to dock on arrival. See\n\np.22. There was no misleading impression.\n\n      Moreover, any probative value of PHA’s actual-harms evidence in refuting\n\nany minor misimpression would be substantially outweighed by undue delay and\n\nthe unfair prejudice to Zachry. 1SCR6:1116(A7). The trial court noted direct and\n\ncross-examination of PHA witnesses would be lengthy and could devolve into a\n\nlong battle over the alleged harms, causation, and quantification.         Id.   Plus,\n\nrequiring Zachry to cross-examine without discovery would be highly prejudicial.\n\nId.\n\n      PHA incorrectly contends once evidence is deemed admissible under an\n\nopen-the-door theory, Rule 403 cannot exclude it. But PHA’s case reached no\n\nsuch holding. See PHASupp:55-56 (citing Horizon/CMS Healthcare. v. Auld, 34\n\nS.W.3d 887, 905-07 (Tex. 2000)). Authorities have concluded that “even if a party\n\nopens the door to rebuttal evidence, the trial judge still has the discretion to\n\nexclude the evidence under Rule 403.” Hayden v. State, 296 S.W.3d 549, 554\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 2009); accord Brown & Rondon, TEXAS RULES            OF   EVIDENCE\n\nHANDBOOK §107, at 95 (2015); Goode, Wellborn & Sharlot, 1 TEX. PRACTICE:\n\nTEX.

Any error was harmless.\n      The case did not turn on actual-harms evidence: any misimpression was\n\nminimal, as Zachry argued only that PHA said it would not charge LDs if the\n\ncrane-ship docked on arrival—not if PHA suffered no harm at all, p.10; PHA’s\n\nevidence of harms from the Milestone-A delay was nonexistent, 26:16-17, 20-21,\n\nor weak at best, 67:5-10; 70:15-27; and PHA did offer actual-harms evidence,\n\n35:24-26; 64:44-45; 65:57-59; DX419; Aplt.Br:68.           Plus, other evidence—\n\nincluding PHA’s last-minute rejection of Zachry’s methods PHA knew were\n\n“required”—supported the arbitrary-and-capricious and bad-faith findings. See\n\npp.5-9, 11-22.\n\nVI.   The trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to fraud.\n\n      A.    The Supreme Court approved the recklessness instruction.\n      The Supreme Court rejected PHA’s argument—briefed in that Court—that\n\nrecklessness does not support a promise-of-future-performance-made-with-an-\n\nintent-not-to-perform fraud: it quoted the fraud charge in full, and held “[t]he\n\ncharge correctly described the misconduct that cannot be covered by a no-\n\ndamages-for-delay provision.” Zachry, 449 S.W.3d at 104 n.7, 118(A3). In its\n\nrehearing   motion, PHA      asked   the    Court   to   reconsider   this   holding,\n\nPHAMot/Reh’g:25, but it declined.\n\n\n                                       60\n\f      Authorities confirm a promise with no intent to perform may be based on\n\neither knowledge of falsity or recklessness. See Beneficial Personnel Servs. v. Rey,\n\n927 S.W.2d 157, 167-70 (Tex.App.—El Paso 1996, vac. w.r.m.); Mann v.\n\nFitzhugh-Straus Medina Ranch, 640 S.W.2d 367, 371 (Tex.App.—San Antonio\n\n1982, no writ); TEX. P.J.C. BUSINESS §§105.2, 105.3B. PHA’s first four cases do\n\nnot consider whether promise-with-no-intent-to-perform fraud can be based on\n\nrecklessness. See PHASupp:57. The last three contain no analysis, and cannot\n\noverrule the Supreme Court’s Zachry decision. Id.\n\n      B.    No charge error tainted the no-damages-for-delay exceptions.\n      Assuming error, PHA asserts a new trial is required because the jury might\n\nhave concluded PHA was reckless. PHASupp:57. But there is ample evidence\n\nPHA intentionally defrauded Zachry as PHA defines it. See Zachry, 449 S.W.3d at\n\n103(A3); pp.10-11; Aple.Br:48-50. Any error was harmless.\n\n      Furthermore, Casteel would not require retrial, because it is “reasonably\n\ncertain” the jury was “not significantly influenced” by the allegedly erroneous\n\nfraud issue, since PHA never challenged the evidentiary sufficiency of the other\n\nno-damages-for-delay exceptions. See Thota v. Young, 366 S.W.3d 678, 688 (Tex.\n\n2012); Aple.Br:48-49 n.38.\n\n\n\n\n                                        61\n\fVII. The apparent-authority instructions were proper.\n\n      A.     Apparent authority is a fact issue.\n      Section 12(d)’s limits on Thiess’s authority to “change” the Contract are\n\nirrelevant to Zachry’s claim PHA breached it. Cf. pp.45-48.            PHA’s assertion\n\nThiess—not PHA—directed Zachry to work in the wet is likewise incorrect. See\n\np.43-44.14\n\n      Regardless, apparent authority is a fact issue even when limitations are\n\npresent. See Equitable Life Assur. Soc’y v. Ellis, 147 S.W. 1152, 1158 (Tex.\n\n1912); Paramount Nat’l Life Ins. v. Williams, 772 S.W.2d 255, 261-62\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1989, writ denied). PHA’s case merely holds that\n\nif the only evidence regarding apparent authority is a limitation, the limit controls.\n\nSee Douglass v. Panama, 504 S.W.2d 776, 779 (Tex. 1974).\n\n      CH2M-Hill and Theiss had apparent authority to convey decisions and\n\ninformation to and from Zachry on PHA’s behalf:\n\nQ.    And you had designated in your dealings with Zachry, CH2M-Hill to be\n      your representative for those purposes in exchanging information back and\n      forth…?\n\nA.    [DeWolf]: That was one of their roles, yes.\n14\n   PHA’s additional-work argument appears limited to its incorrect causation argument. PHA\ndoes not challenge damages under TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE §271.153(a)(2)’s additional-work\nmeasure. Nor could it: the Supreme Court confirmed delay damages are recoverable under\n§271.153(a)(1), and PHA obtained an order finding 100% of Zachry’s damages are delay\ndamages. CR60:17517-18; 60:17526. The Court can be “reasonably certain” the jury was “not\nsignificantly influenced” by the additional-work measure (which was proper anyway,\nAple.Br:50-52). See Thota, 366 S.W.3d at 688.\n\n                                           62\n\f6:86; see 6:84-87; 8:44-46; 25:9-12. Other evidence proved PHA expected Zachry\n\nto rely on CH2M-Hill communications, 6:85-86; 8:45-46; 21:34; 44:47-48;\n\nCH2M-Hill was DeWolf's representative, 8:45-46; DX1-1.0244, §12(c)(A16);\n\nCH2M-Hill was PHA’s primary point-of-contact with Zachry, 44:43-44; see 37:36;\n\nand PHA executives treated CH2M-Hill like PHA staff, 46:74-75.\n\n      Additionally, the PHA-approved Construction Management Plan—posted on\n\nthe Constructware website for Zachry to view—told Zachry CH2M-Hill is “an\n\nextension of the PHA staff,” would “act as [PHA’s] representative on site,” and\n\nwould “have all authority normally attributed to a [construction manager] acting as\n\nowner’s agent (not at risk).” PX57.0009, §2.2(A39); see 9:46-47; 37:37-38; 44:54-\n\n58; 47:156-57; see also 44:44; 68:101; 69:106.\n\n      Thus, even if §5.42 notice was tried, Zachry substantially complied by\n\ngiving notice to CH2M-Hill’s Thiess, whom PHA led Zachry to believe was\n\nauthorized to accept such information for PHA. See pp.62-63.\n\n      B.    Zachry pleaded apparent authority.\n      The trial court’s determination that Zachry pleaded apparent authority was\n\nwithin its “broad discretion when interpreting pleadings.”      Pace Concerts v.\n\nResendez, 72 S.W.3d 700, 703 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2002, pet. denied).\n\nZachry pleaded PHA “expressly charged and designated its Construction Manager,\n\nCH2M-Hill, to act on its behalf on this critical cutoff-wall issue.” CR29:8137,\n\n                                        63\n\f¶13(A8); see id. at 8138, ¶13 (calling CH2M-Hill “PHA’s designated agent”).\n\nZachry also alleged PHA took actions a non-human entity like PHA could only\n\ntake through agents. See id. at 8133-46. Because PHA did not specially except,\n\nZachry’s pleadings are construed “liberally…to include all claims that reasonably\n\nmay be inferred….” Allison v. Service Lloyds Ins., 437 S.W.3d 589, 592 n.2\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. denied).\n\n      Zachry’s agency allegation is not limited to actual authority. Both actual\n\nand apparent authority are based on a principal's designation of authority; they\n\ndiffer only as to whether the designation is communicated to the agent or a third\n\nparty. See In re ADM Inv. Servs., 304 S.W.3d 371, 374 (Tex. 2010). Courts have\n\nheld apparent authority alleged in the absence of those words. See, e.g., Iron Mtn.\n\nBison Ranch v. Easley Trailer Mfg., 42 S.W.3d 149, 157 (Tex.App.—Amarillo\n\n2000, no pet.); Cox v. Humble Oil & Refining, 16 S.W.2d 285, 286 (Tex.Comm’n\n\nApp.1929); Chapapas v. Delhi Taylor Oil, 323 S.W.2d 64, 66 (Tex.Civ.App.—San\n\nAntonio 1959, writ ref'd n.r.e.).\n\nVIII. PHA is not entitled to attorneys’ fees if Zachry prevails on any theory.\n      PHA is not entitled to attorneys’ fees because judgment for Zachry should\n\nbe affirmed. See DX1-1.0201, §3.10(A13).\n\n      Even if Zachry does not prevail on its R&R-Order breach-of-contract theory,\n\nPHA is not entitled to attorneys’ fees. Contract §3.10 permits PHA to recover fees\n\n\n                                        64\n\fon the Contractor’s claim only “[i]f…Contractor does not prevail with respect to\n\nsuch claim.” DX1-1.0201(A13). A party prevails if it recovers some relief on its\n\nclaim, regardless of the amount. Intercontinental Grp. Ptnrshp. v. KB Home Lone\n\nStar, 295 S.W.3d 650, 654 (Tex. 2009); Flagship Hotel. v. City of Galveston, 117\n\nS.W.3d 552, 564 (Tex.App.—Texarkana 2003, pet. denied). “[I]t is the judgment,\n\nnot the verdict, that we must consider in determining whether attorneys’ fees are\n\nproper.” Intercontinental, 295 S.W.3d at 656.\n\n      Zachry brought one claim: breach of contract. CR29:08142-44. Zachry\n\nasserted PHA breached the parties’ Contract in multiple ways, including by issuing\n\nthe R&R Order and withholding LDs. The judgment awarded Zachry one lump\n\nsum for this breach-of-contract claim, without distinguishing between damages for\n\neach underlying theory. CR62:18166(A1).\n\n      Indeed, Texas law holds a single claim may include multiple liability\n\ntheories, and a plaintiff prevails on that single claim if it prevails on any theory.\n\nSee, e.g., 4901 Main, Inc. v. TAS Automotive, 187 S.W.3d 627, 633-35\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.); Flagship Hotel, 117 S.W.3d at\n\n564-66; Solar Soccer Club v. Prince of Peace Luth. Church, 234 S.W.3d 814, 829\n\nn.2 (Tex.App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied); Structural Metals, Inc. v. S&C Elec.\n\nCo., 590 Fed. Appx. 298, 305 (5th Cir. 2014). PHA’s cases defining “claim” as\n\n\n\n\n                                         65\n\f“demand for compensation” do not address whether a claim can encompass\n\nmultiple theories. See PHASupp:61. 15\n\n       Accordingly, if Zachry obtains relief on any theory underlying its breach-of-\n\ncontract claim—for example, its judgment for improperly withheld LDs affirmed\n\nby the Supreme Court—then Zachry prevails, and PHA is not entitled to fees.\n\n       PHA argues it should recover attorneys’ fees if it wins on the R&R claim\n\nbecause it is the “main issue.” PHASupp:62-63. But the judgment determines\n\nwhether attorneys’ fees are proper. Intercontinental, 295 S.W.3d at 656. As long\n\nas Zachry obtains relief in the judgment on its breach-of-contract claim, regardless\n\nof theory, it prevails. See id. at 654; see Flagship, 117 S.W.3d at 564 (inquiry is\n\nwhether agreement was breached, “not the extent of the breach.”). Furthermore,\n\nIntercontinental cast doubt on whether the prevailing party should be determined\n\nby “main issue” analysis. See Intercontinental, 295 S.W.3d at 661; see also id. at\n\n659 n.42.\n\n       Even if “main–issue” analysis is viable, when only one party receives\n\n15\n  PHA implies that because the attorneys’-fee question segregated fees between breach-of-\ncontract theories, Zachry does not assert a single claim. PHASupp:61-62. Nothing required\nZachry to object to the Charge—which broke out fees by theory to avoid any need for retrial if\nZachry was incorrect—to preserve its argument that Zachry prevails if it wins any breach-of-\ncontract theory.\n\n        But Zachry did object. 71:72(A41) (“Attorneys’ fees should not be submitted at all….”).\nAs here, it argued, “regardless of what happens on the remaining breach-of-contract theories,\nZachry will have a net recovery on its breach-of-contract claim, and as a matter of law, [PHA]\ncannot be the prevailing party.” Id.\n\n                                              66\n\fjudgment in its favor, “regardless of the amount of damages,” “courts have\n\nconcluded that party prevailed on the main issue.” Flagship, 117 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n“Main-issue” analysis applies (if at all) in cases—like those cited by PHA—where\n\nthe Court must determine who prevails when neither party obtains relief. See\n\nBhatia v. Woodlands North Houston Heart Ctr., 396 S.W.3d 658, 663, 671\n\n(Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied); SEECO, Inc. v. K.T. Rock, 416\n\nS.W.3d 664, 666, 674 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, pet. denied).\n\nIX.   Zachry’s recovery on its pass-through claim should be affirmed.\n      On January 1, 2008, Zachry reorganized. PX529; 47:123-29. Under the\n\nnew structure, Zachry subcontracted with a new Zachry entity, “the Sub,” to finish\n\nthe wharf. Id.; 47:129-31; PX643(A37); PX642(A38). The Sub employed the\n\nsame people that worked on the project pre-reorganization.       47:129.   Going\n\nforward, the Sub incurred the costs from PHA’s breach. PX642(A38);\n\nPX643(A37); 47:132-34. Zachry must reimburse the Sub for those costs, including\n\nany recovery in this case. Id.\n\n      A.     Zachry asserts a valid pass-through claim.\n      PHA contends Zachry cannot assert a pass-through claim because it hired\n\nthe Sub after PHA’s breach, and thus “PHA’s…breach…did not cause Zachry to\n\nbreach the subcontract.” PHASupp:65. But nothing in the seminal case approving\n\npass-through agreements requires a breach by Zachry. See Interstate Contracting\n\n\n                                       67\n\fCorp. v. City of Dallas, 135 S.W.3d 605, 619-20 (Tex. 2004) (outlining\n\n“requirements”).    Interstate requires only that Zachry “remain liable to the\n\nsubcontractor for damages sustained by the subcontractor.” Id. at 619.\n\n      Interstate also recognizes a general contractor’s decision to hire a sub to\n\nperform work necessitated by the owner’s breach does not preclude the contractor\n\nfrom recovering the cost for the sub. Id. at 611. “Otherwise, the owner could\n\nreceive a windfall because the subcontractor lacked privity with the owner and the\n\ncontractor lacked standing to sue the owner for damages suffered by the\n\nsubcontractor.” Id. at 615-16.\n\n      Here, Zachry established its continuing liability to the Sub for the costs the\n\njury assessed. In the Management Services Agreement (“MSA”), Zachry promised\n\n(1) “to pay to [the Sub] the Reimbursable Costs” it incurred while performing\n\nServices for Zachry, and (2) to pay to the Sub any payments it received from the\n\nowner.    PX643.0004, ¶3.1(A37).        In the Pass-Through Agreement, Zachry\n\n“agree[d]...it is liable to [the Sub], to present the ZCC Claims and remit any\n\nrecovery from the Port of Houston to [the Sub], in accordance with the terms of\n\nthis Agreement.” PX642, ¶1.1(A38). Testimony confirmed Zachry’s continuing\n\nliability to the Sub. 47:127, 130-34.\n\n      The burden therefore shifted to PHA to negate this continuing liability: “If\n\nthe owner disputes that this requirement [of continuing liability] has been met, it\n\n\n                                         68\n\fbears the burden of proving, as an affirmative defense, that the pass-through\n\narrangement negates the contractor's responsibility for the costs incurred by the\n\nsubcontractor.” 135 S.W.3d at 619-20 (“The owner disproves…contractor’s\n\ncontinuing liability only if it can show… contractor is not obligated to remit any\n\nrecovery to…subcontractor.”).\n\n      PHA asserts Zachry might not remain liable to the Sub. PHA speculates—\n\nincorrectly—that owners on other MSA contracts might have paid Zachry more\n\nthan the Reimbursable Costs on their contracts, and that any such excess payments\n\nlimit Zachry’s liability for Reimbursable Costs for the PHA Contract. PHA’s\n\nargument fails to meet its burden.\n\n      First, PHA misunderstands the MSA. It unambiguously states, “Zachry\n\nagrees to pay to Manager [the Sub] the Reimbursable Costs.”          PX643.0004,\n\n§3.1(A37).    PHA incorrectly reads §3.2 to limit Zachry’s obligation to pay\n\nReimbursable Costs when Contract Payments exceed Reimbursable Costs. To the\n\ncontrary, it unambiguously provides the parties shall divide “such excess amounts”\n\nin “a mutually satisfactory allocation.” Id. at §3.2(A37).   Nothing in the MSA\n\nsuggests that allocation of “such excess amounts” limits Reimbursable Costs\n\nZachry must pay to the Sub on other contracts. Id.(A37).\n\n      Second, even if PHA reads the MSA correctly, PHA proved no other\n\ncontract “windfall” to negate Zachry’s liability for the Sub’s Reimbursable Costs\n\n\n                                       69\n\fon this Contract.\n\n       B.       The Court correctly charged the jury on pass-through.\n       PHA’s charge-error arguments likewise fail. Zachry unambiguously agreed\n\nto pay the Sub Reimbursable Costs, and PHA failed to negate Zachry’s liability to\n\nthe Sub.        Accordingly, the trial court properly granted a directed verdict\n\nrecognizing the pass-through agreement’s validity and Zachry’s right to recover\n\nthe Sub’s damages, and properly declined to charge the jury to include those costs\n\nonly “to the extent” Zachry agreed to reimburse the Sub for them. 71:11-13(A40);\n\nCR59:17365-74. Nor was the Court’s instruction that the jury “should” include in\n\ndamages any Reimbursable Costs an improper comment.\n\n       C.       Waiver of immunity applies to the pass-through claims.\n       Nor does immunity bar pass-through claims.                City of San Antonio v.\n\nValemas, 2012 WL 2126932, *7 (Tex.App.—San Antonio 2012, no pet.); Hensel\n\nPhelps Constr. v. McCarthy Bld'g, 2005 WL 1489932, *4 (N.D. Tex. 2005). Cf.\n\nGalveston I.S.D. v. Clear Lake Rehab. Hosp., 324 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex.App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.) (“§271.152’s waiver…[applies to] a class of\n\nsuits—suits for purposes of adjudicating a claim for breach of contract subject to\n\n[Chapter 271]—without restricting which parties can bring suit”) (emphasis\n\noriginal)).16\n\n16\n  The pass-through did not evade the no-assignment clause. PHASupp:63 n.6. Zachry expressly\ndid not assign the Contract. PX643.0001, ¶C (A37). Interstate recognized the validity of pass-\n                                             70\n\f                                       PRAYER\n\n      The trial court’s judgment should be affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                             Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                             By: /s/ Robin C.

Plaintiff Zachry Construction\n                                       '                                 .\nCorporation, now known as Zachry IndustriaL Inc., appeared through its representatives and\n\nthrough its attorneys and announced ready for trial. Defendant, Port of Houston Authority of\n\nHarris County, Texas, appeared through its representatives and through its attorneys and\n\nannounced ready for trial.\n\n       After the jury was impaneled and sworn, it heard the evidence and arguments of counsel.\n\nAfter the close of the defendant's cast und the clost! of ull evidence. Zachry Construction\n\nCorporation moved fo r a directed vcn.lict. The Court or:Jlly b'TOnted a directed verd ict on certain\n\nissues, as stated in open court on January 14, 2009. The Charge of the Court was then submitted\n\nto the jury, and in response, the jury made tindings that the Court received, filed, and entered of\n\nrecord. The questions submitted to the jury and the jury's findings arc attached as Exhibit A to\n\nZachry's Motion for Judgment and Mt..,tion to Disregard Jury Findings or for JNOV with Respect\n\nto Certain Jury Findings and   im:orporat~d   by retcrcnce.\n\n       After the verdict, Zachry Constructilm Corporation filed its Motion for Judgment and\n\nMotion to Disregard Jury Findings or for JNOV with Respect to Certain Jury Findings,\n\nspeci ficall y asking the Court to disregard   th~   jury's answers to Question Nos. 12.A. and 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   !Si·€2\n\f                                •                                                 •\n   Zachry later filed its Supplemental Motion for Judgment and to Disregard Certain Jury Findings,\n\n   specifically asking the Court to also disregard the jury's answers to Question Nos. 4 and 9, and\n\n   to disregard Question No. 5 as a basis for reducing Zachry's damages.\n\n              While the parties have extensively briefed myriad issues after the jury rendered its\n\n   verdict. the Court wishes to write briefly on the cent ral issue on which Defendant Port of\n                                                                              .\n   Houston Authority seems to havt focused, so\\'creign immunity: The Court has carefully\n\n   considered the authority that the parti es presented (m this issue. The Court is not persuaded that\n\n   Texas Jaw precludes an award to Plaintiff Zachry Construction Corporation for the damages\n\n   found by the jury. The Court has read and considered. among many other cases, Tooke v. City of\n\n   Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325 (Tex.. 2006), McKinney & Moore, Inc. \\'. City of Longview, No. 14-08-\n\n   00628-CV, 2009 WL 4577348 (Tex. App. ··-Houston ll4'h Dist.] Dec.' 8, 2009, pet. fi led), and\n                                                                          .                          -\n   Ciry of 1/ousron v. Southern Electri<.: Sen·ices, 273 S. W.3d 739 (Tex.. App.- Houston [I 51 Dist.]\n\n   2008, pet. denied). .\n\n          The last case, Sourhern Electric. providcs guidance for the Court. The Court understands\n\n- that the case involved a plt:a to the jurisdiction. id. at 744. and that the current matter docs not.\n\n   Nevertheless, the court in Sorahern Electric was still squarely tuced with the question of whether\n\n   a pleading of damages that were not c:<prl·ssly contemplated by the contract at issue, but were\n\n   instead,   clear~v   owsidc of the contract, deprived   th~   trial court of j urisdiction as being outside of\n\n   the damages permitted in section 271.153. Jd. The court in Sou/hem Eleclric seems to have\n\n   understood what it was dealing with. and could easily have concluded that the pleading of the\n\n  damages for increased costs to perform the contract. which was unquestionably outside of 1he\n\n   four comers of the contract, id.. ueprivt!d the trial court of jurisdiction. The court did not, and\n\n   instead essentiall y found section 271.153 to be a mcrc limitation on damages (and it was\n\n\n\n\n                                                       2\n                                                                              /\n\f                             •\n  published after the Supreme Court's opinion in Tooke) . Id.\n                                                                        •\n                                                                       Indeed, the court in Southern\n\n  Electric seems to have held that by pleading tor damages that were clearly outside the express\n\n  terms of the contract, the plaintiff in that case nevertheless had \"alleg[ed] facts to support their\n\n  claim that the City has not paid the balance due and owed under the contract.\" !d. (internal\n\n  quotations omitted). Finally, contrary to the Defendant Pon of' Houston Authority's arguments.\n\n  both Southern Electric, 273 S.W.3d at 744, and Cit,v u,(Mesquite v. PKG Contracting, Inc., 263\n\n  S.W.3d 444, 448 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.) (both written after Tooke) seem to conclude\n\n  that section 271.153 is not jurisdictional. but merely a limitation on damages.\n\n          In the end, the Court is unwilling to find that the \"balance due and owed\" language in\n\n  271.153   et seq.   requires that the types of damages that a contractor sues for after an alleged\n\n- breach of contract by tht:: owner have to be expressly li sted in the contract. The Co.urt believes\n\n  that despite Defendant Port of Houston Authority's excellent briefing and arguments to the\n\n  contrary, such a finding would likely lead to absurd results. The Court can imagine contracts\n\n  expanding to include hundreds of pages of boilerplate and surplussage, drafted by battalions of\n\n  lawyers (not that the Court    ~as   anything against lawyers). that no one reads just to cover any ·\n\n  possible contingency, and any permutation or derivation of any such contingency. If that were\n\n  so, and if Mr. Nixon's statements in the legislative history really carried the day, then such\n\n  language could have easily been includt:d in section 271.153. It was not.\n\n         The Court believes that it understands and appreciates Defendant Port of Houston\n\n  Authority's position that the limitation on damages contained in Texas Local Gov't Code section\n\n  271 .153 et seq. is part of the limited waiver of sovc:reign immunity and thus those provisions\n\n  should be construed narro,vly. The bottom line is that. whether that position is correct or not, the\n\n  Court docs not find that this issue to be dispositive. The Court's \\'iew is that the answer is in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n\f ..                            •                                                    •\nlanguage of sections 271 .153(a)(l) and (2). That is, the Court tinds that the damages arc direct\n\ndamages and constitute (a) the balance due and owed by the local governmental entity under the\n\ncontract as it may have been amended, including any amount owed as compensation for the\n\nincreased cost to perfonn the work as a direct result of owner-caused delays or accelera~ion; or\n\n(2) the amount owed for change orders or additional work the contractor is directed to pcrfonn\n\nby a local governmental entity in connection with the contract, or both. That is true whether the\n\nsection is interpreted narrowly or broadly. 1\n\n         The Court has considered Zachry Construction Corporation's motions, the Port's Motions\n\nfor JNOV, the parties responses, as well as the parties replies and sur-replies, the record in this\n\nmatter, and the jury verdict, and RENDERS jud~:,rment t{lr Zachry Construction Corporation and\n\nagainst the Port of Houston Authority of Harris County.

Further, the Court has not awarded the $600,000 withheld for\n\ndredging work that the jury refused to award to Plaintiff;\n\n         (2)      lt   is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Zat:hry\n\nConstruction Corporation recover from the Defendant Port of Houston Authority of Harri$\n\nCounty, Texas prejudgment interest on that sum in the amount of $3,451 ,022.40, which is\n\n\n\n1\n  The Coun is also not persuaded that any narrow reading of se~:ti on 271 .153 relates to the continued existence of\ncommon law exceptions to the no-damages-for-dday clause in the Wharf :md Dredging Contract.

Following a three-month\njury trial, the trial court entered a final judgment, awarding Zachry damages in the amount $19,992,697, plus pre- and\npost-judgment interest. The Port appeals the final judgment in eleven issues. Zachry also brings three issue on cross-appeal.\nWe reverse and render.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2003, the Port solicited bids to construct a wharf at the Bayport Ship Channel. The wharf consisted of five sections, each\napproximately 330 feet in length. Zachry’s bid proposed building the wharf “in the dry” by using a U-shaped, frozen earthen\nwall to seal out water from Galveston Bay from the construction site. Zachry proposed to freeze the wall by sinking 100–foot\npipes into the wall and circulating chilled brine through the pipes. Then, Zachry would install drilled shafts into the ground,\npour a concrete deck on top of the drilled shafts and dirt using the ground as the bottom of the concrete form, excavate the\ndirt under the deck, and place revetment to stabilize the slope. After completing the wharf, Zachry would breach the freeze\nwall, flooding the area, and remove the remainder of the freeze wall so that ships would be able to dock at the wharf and\nunload their cargo.\n\nAn advantage of working “in the dry” instead of “in the wet” is that fewer “NOx” emission credits would be consumed. The\nPort accepted Zachry’s bid because of the environmental benefits of using the freeze wall. On June 1, 2004, Zachry entered\ninto the Bayport Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract with the Port for the construction of a 1,660–foot wharf. The Port\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nhad concerns about the possible impact of the frozen soil on adjacent structures but provided in the contract that Zachry\nwould control the means and methods. Zachry hired RKK–SoilFreeze Technologies, which, in turn, hired Dan Mageau of\nGeoEngineers, a geotechnical engineer, to design the freeze wall.\n\nThe contract also provided a strict timeline. Specifically, Zachry was to complete construction of the wharf by June 1, 2006.\nZachry was also to meet an interim deadline of February 1, 2006—Milestone A—by which a portion of the wharf would be\nsufficiently complete to allow delivery of large ship-to-shore cranes that were to be shipped from China. The contract also\nprovided that Zachry’s sole remedy for any delay on the project was an extension of time.\n\nIn March 2005, the Port decided to extend the original wharf Zachry was constructing by 332 feet. Zachry submitted price\nquotes for the wharf extension on April 13, May 18, and July 11. The Port and Zachry executed Change Order 4 for the wharf\nextension on September 27, 2005. Change Order 4 extended the dates for Milestone A to February 15, 2006, and final\ncompletion to July 15, 2006.\n\nFrom Zachry’s perspective, Change Order 4 incorporated the April 13 proposal as further modified by the May 18 and July\n11 proposals. So, Zachry had Mageau design a frozen cutoff wall (frozen COW), a perpendicular wall to the main freeze\nwall, to split the project into two phases: a west side including Area A, and an east side. Zachry sent that September 9, 2005\nfrozen COW design to the Port for “review,” not “approval.” Zachry believed it had the right to use the frozen cutoff wall and\nto do so with “uninterrupted work process.”\n\n*845 From the Port’s perspective, Zachry’s September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff wall design was subject to a contractual\ntechnical specification that provided the Port with the right to respond. Because the contract specifically provided the Port a\nright to respond with a “revise and resubmit” (R & R), and because the Port had serious concerns about the design, that is\nprecisely what it did. The Port provided its R & R response that (1) noted preliminary indications that the design may have an\nindeterminate effect on up to 14 shafts, (2) directed Zachry either to “present [an] alternative cutoff wall design” or to\n“present the Port of Houston with an alternate means of mitigating risk” to the shafts, and (3) allowed Zachry to use the\nfrozen COW design if the shafts were protected.\n\nUltimately, in late November 2005, Zachry abandoned the frozen COW and switched to an “in the wet” scenario. The Port\nurges the course was Zachry’s voluntary change in recognition that the freeze wall was “killing the schedule.” Zachry urges\nthat it was due to the Port’s rejection of the frozen COW (Zachry’s means and methods) and unwillingness to depart from the\ncontract deadlines.\n\nIn May 2006, the Port notified Zachry that, due to Zachry’s delay, the Port would begin withholding liquidated damages from\npayments on Zachry’s monthly invoices. After withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages, the Port voluntarily stopped\nwithholding liquidated damages.\n\nIn late 2006, Zachry sued the Port for breach of contract, i.e., the R & R response, by failing to comply with Change Order 4\nand section 5.10 of the contract, for the difference between the cost that Zachry would have incurred had it been allowed to\ncomplete the wharf “in the dry,” i.e., using the frozen cutoff wall, and the actual cost Zachry incurred in completing the wharf\n“in the wet,” i.e., without the frozen cutoff wall. Zachry also sued the Port for withholding liquidated damages for delays in\nthe amount of $2.36 million, and for the Port’s withholding of $600,000 as a purported offset for alleged defective dredging\nunder Change Order 1. The Port filed a counterclaim for attorney’s fees under section 3.10 of the contract, which provides\nthat Zachry is liable for the Port’s attorney’s fees if Zachry brings a “claim” against the Port and “does not prevail with\nrespect to such claim.” Over two years after suing the Port, Zachry declared the wharf complete on January 26, 2009.\n\nAfter a three-month trial, the case was submitted to the jury. The jury found that the Port had breached the contract by failing\nto comply with Change Order 4 and section 5.10, and found compensatory damages in the amount of $18,602,697 for the\nPort’s breach of the contract. These damages represented Zachry’s increased costs for switching to working in the “wet.” The\njury found that 58.13% of those damages were for delay or hindrance.\n\nThe jury did not find that the Port failed to comply with the contract by withholding $600,000 from the Port’s payment on the\namounts invoiced by Zachry for defective dredging.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nThe trial court instructed the jury that the Port had failed to comply with the contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36 million\nwithheld as liquidated damages. Thus, the jury needed only to determine whether the Port was entitled to offset; the jury\nfound for the Port on the offset defense in the amount of $970,000 for Zachry’s defective work on the Wharf fenders.\n\nThe jury found reasonable attorney’s fees for the Port with respect to Zachry’s claim relating to Change Order 4 and/or\nsection 5.10: (1) $10,500,000 for trial; (2) *846 $90,000 for appeal to the court of appeals; and (3) $22,500 for appeal to the\nTexas Supreme Court. The jury found reasonable attorney’s fees for the Port as to Zachry’s claim for withholding the $2.36\nmillion as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging: (1) $80,250 for trial; (2) $3,750 for appeal to the court of\nappeals; and (3) $1,250 for appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nIn its final judgment, the trial court awarded Zachry damages in the amount of $19,992,697—$18,602,697 plus $2.36 million\nin liquidated damages, less the $970,000 offset for the defective fenders, pre-judgment interest in the amount of\n$3,451,022.40, post-judgment interest on the total sum award of $23,443,719, and taxable costs. The trial court did not award\nthe $600,000 withheld for defective dredging that the jury refused to award to Zachry. The trial court did not award\nattorney’s fees to the Port.\n\nIn this appeal, the Port claims that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s findings on breach,\ncausation, and damages; governmental immunity bars Zachry’s claim for R & R damages; the no-damages-for-delay clause\nbars Zachry’s delay damages; Zachry’s failure to obtain a change order bars its recovery of R & R damages; Zachry’s failure\nto provide written notice of a breach bars its R & R damages; governmental immunity bars Zachry’s “pass-through” claim\ndamages incurred by its subcontractor; the trial court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the Port’s harms and\nlosses; the Port’s failure to comply with the contract by withholding liquidated damages was excused by release, as a matter\nof law; the trial court erred by instructing the jury on apparent authority; and the Port is entitled to attorney’s fees.\n\nIn its cross-appeal, Zachry claims it is entitled to judgment, as a matter of law, for the $600,000 the Port withheld for\ndefective dredging; the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support to support the jury’s findings that the Port did\nnot fail to comply with the contract with respect to the fenders; and the evidence is factually insufficient to support the jury’s\nfindings on the amount of the Port’s attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         II.

In Issue 4A, the Port\ncontends that section 5.07’s no-damages-for-delay clause bars Zachry’s R & R damages. Specifically, the Port complains that\nthe trial court erred by applying a common-law, tort-like “exception” to the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause. Section\n5.07—the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause—provides:\n\n             The Contractor shall receive no financial compensation for delay or hindrance of the Work. In no event\n             shall the Port Authority be liable to the Contractor or any Subcontractor or Supplier, any other person\n             or any surety for or any employee or agent of any of them, for any damages arising out of or associated\n             with any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance, including\n             events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM,\n             ARISES OUT OF OR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF\n             CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY. The Contractor’s sole remedy in\n             any such case shall be an extension of time.\n\n*847 Question No. 3 asked the jury: “What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly compensate Zachry for its\ndamages, if any, that resulted from the Port’s failure to comply?” Relevant to this issue, the trial court instructed the jury that\nthe contract’s no-damages-for-delay provision precluded Zachry’s R & R damages for delay or hindrance unless the jury\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nfound that such damages resulted from the Port’s “arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or\nfraud.”1 The jury found R & R damages in the amount of $18,602,697.\n\n1\n              In Question No. 3, the trial court instructed the jury as follows with respect to section 5.07:\n                  You are instructed that § 5.07 of the Contract precludes Zachry from recovering delay or hindrance damages, if any, unless\n                  you find that the delay or hindrance damages, if any, resulted from a delay or hindrance that was the result of the Port’s\n                  actions, if any, that constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.\n\n\n\nQuestion No. 4 asked the jury: “What percentage of the damages that you found in your answer to Question No. 3 was for\ndelay or hindrance damages?” The jury found 58.13% of Zachry’s R & R damages resulted from delay or hindrance.\nHowever, in an agreed motion, the Port and Zachry asked the trial court to disregard the jury’s finding that 58.13% of such\ndamages were the result of delay or hindrance because such finding was not supported by legally and factually evidence and,\ninstead, asked the trial court to find that the evidence conclusively established, as a matter of law, that the answer to Question\nNo. 4 is 100%. The trial court entered an agreed order disregarding the jury’s answer of 58.13% to Question No. 4 and found\nthat it was conclusively established, as a matter of law, that the answer to Question No. 4 is 100%.\n\n         Our primary concern when we construe a written contract is to ascertain the parties’ true intent as expressed in the\n[1] [2] [3]\n\ncontract. In re Serv. Corp. Int’l, 355 S.W.3d 655, 661 (Tex.2011) (per curiam) (orig. proceeding); Epps v. Fowler, 351\nS.W.3d 862, 865 (Tex.2011). “We must examine and consider the entire writing ‘in an effort to harmonize and give effect to\nall the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless.’ ” Grohman v.

Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 662 (Tex.2005)). “We begin this\nanalysis with the contract’s express language.” Italian Cowboy Partners, Ltd. v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 341 S.W.3d 323,\n333 (Tex.2011). The construction of an unambiguous contract is a question of law for the court, which we consider under a\nde novo standard of review. Tawes v. Barnes, 340 S.W.3d 419, 425 (Tex.2011); see also Exxon Corp. v. Emerald Oil & Gas\nCo., L.C., 348 S.W.3d 194, 214 (Tex.2011) (op. on reh’g) (“Where an ambiguity has not been raised by the parties, the\ninterpretation of a contract is a question of law.”).\n\nZachry alleged that it suffered delay or hindrance damages on the project attributable to conduct by the Port, and the jury\nagreed. We have long recognized that “[i]n the absence of provision to the contrary, a contractor ... is entitled to recover\ndamages from a contractee ... for losses due to delay and hindrance of work if it proves (1) that its work was delayed or\nhindered, (2) that it suffered damages because of the delay or hindrance, and (3) that the contractee was responsible for the\nact or omission which caused the delay or hindrance.” *848 City of Houston v. R.F. Ball Constr. Co., 570 S.W.2d 75, 77\n(Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1978, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (citing Anderson Dev. Corp. v. Coastal States Crude Gathering\nCo., 543 S.W.2d 402 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1976, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).\n\nThe Port of Houston alleged that section 5.07 is a “provision to the contrary.” The trial court rejected the Port’s construction\nof section 5.07 as a blanket prohibition of delay damages. Instead, through its instruction in Question No. 3, the trial court\ndetermined, as a matter of law, that the Port could not enforce section 5.07 to preclude delay or hindrance damages resulting\nfrom any action by the Port that constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith, or fraud.\n\nInasmuch as the delay damages constitute 100% of the damages awarded, a threshold question this court must resolve on\nappeal is whether the damage award is tainted because the trial court misinterpreted the contract and engrafted common-law\nexceptions onto the contractual no-damages-for-delay provision.\n\nGenerally, courts of many other jurisdictions give only a “restrained approval” of no-damages-for-delay provisions because\nof their harshness. See Maurice T. Brunner, Annotation, Validity and Constructions of “No Damage Clause” with Respect to\nDelay in Building or Construction Contract, 74 A.L.R.3d 187, 201 (1976). Those courts, again generally, construe the\nprovisions strictly against the owner/drafter. Id. It is this strict construction that formed the genesis for common-law\nexceptions to the no-damages-for-delay clause.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Texas Supreme Court has not resolved whether Texas recognizes these exceptions. See Green Int’l,\nInc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 387–88 (Tex.1997) (“Assuming that these ... exceptions preclude the enforcement of\nno-damages-for-delay clauses, these exceptions have not been established in this case.”). However, this court is not facing the\n\n                      © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\napplication of common-law exceptions to a no-damages-for-delay clause for the first time. See R.F. Ball Constr. Co., 570\nS.W.2d at 77–78. Because the parties dispute the application of our precedent,2 we explore it in depth.\n\n2\n        The Port states that “[t]his Court did not hold in R.F. Ball that Texas recognizes common law ‘exceptions.’ ” On the other hand,\n        citing R.F. Ball, among others, Zachry states that “Texas courts have repeatedly recognized and applied the\n        [no-damages-for-delay] exceptions.”\n\n\n\nIn R.F. Ball, the City of Houston appealed a judgment in favor of its contractor arising from the construction of portions of\nthe Houston Intercontinental Airport. Id. at 76. Ball was scheduled to complete the project on April 30, 1967, but did not do\nso until June 9, 1969. During the project, Ball faced “several hundred ‘Change Items’ and between eight hundred and nine\nhundred ‘Clarifications.’ ” Id. The City paid direct costs associated with these changes, but did not pay indirect or impact\ncosts associated with the changes. Id. The types of indirect costs included disruption to the project and “general hindrance of\nefficient work which inevitably resulted from the changes.” Id.\n\nAfter a two-month trial, the jury awarded substantial damages to Ball and specifically found inter alia that (1) the number of\nchanges was greater than foreseen by the parties; (2) the unforeseen changes caused Ball’s delay; and (3) such delay was not\nforeseen when the parties entered into the contract. Id.\n\nThus, on appeal, this court faced these jury findings and a no-damages-for-delay clause that provided, in pertinent part:\n\n             The Contractor shall receive no compensation for delays or hindrances to the *849 work, except when\n             direct and unavoidable extra cost to the Contractor is caused by the failure of the City to provide\n             information or material, if any, which is to be furnished by the City.... If delay is caused by specific\n             orders given by the Engineers to stop work, or by the performance of extra work, or by the failure of\n             the City to provide material or necessary instructions for carrying on the work, then such delay will\n             entitle the Contractor to an equivalent extension of time ....\n\nId. at 77.\n\n\nAs a starting point, and citing to other jurisdictions, this court acknowledged that “one of the exceptions to the application of\na [no-damages-for-delay] provision is that a delay which was not intended or contemplated by the parties to be within the\npurview of the provision is not governed by it.” Id. (citing Ace Stone, Inc. v. Twp. of Wayne, 47 N.J. 431, 435, 221 A.2d 515\n(1966); W. Eng’rs, Inc. v. State Rd. Comm’n, 20 Utah 2d 294, 296, 437 P.2d 216 (1968)). Referring again to other\njurisdictions, we also noted three additional generally recognized exceptions to enforcement of no-damages-for-delay\nclauses.3\n\n3\n        The additional exceptions we mentioned are: (1) delay resulting from fraud, misrepresentation, or other bad faith on the part of one\n        seeking the benefit of the provision; (2) delay that has extended such an unreasonable length of time that the party delayed would\n        have been justified in abandoning the contract; and (3) delay not within the specifically enumerated delays to which the\n        no-damages-for-delay clause applies. R.F. Ball Constr. Co., 570 S.W.2d at 77 n. 1 (citing W. Eng’rs, Inc., 20 Utah 2d at 296, 437\n        P.2d 216).\n\n\n\nWith this background, we examined the intent of the parties arising from the specific language of the contract. Significantly,\nwe specifically rejected Ball’s line of cases that held that “if the delays or their cause were beyond the contemplation of the\nparties, then the [no-damages-for-delay] clause does not apply.” Id. at 78 n. 2 (“We disagree with such cases since they\npreclude operation of the clause in situations where the character of the delay was unforeseen[,] the precise sort of delays the\nclause is designed to cover.”). Ball obtained specific jury findings that the delay it occasioned fell directly within the\ncommon-law exception upon which it relied. Id. at 77–78. Nonetheless, we determined that, because the\nno-damages-for-delay clause was unambiguous and did not limit its application to foreseen delays, Ball could not establish a\nright to compensation for the indirect costs of the delay. Id. at 78.\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   11\n\fPort of Houston Authority of Harris County v. Zachry Const. Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nFinally, we specifically addressed the policy underlying some courts’ rejection or restriction of no-damages-for-delay\nclauses: such provisions are very harsh. Id. Nevertheless, relying explicitly on the “instructive” language of the United States\nSupreme Court, we explained:\n\n            “Men who take $1,000,000 contracts for government buildings are neither unsophisticated nor\n            careless. Inexperience and inattention are more likely to be found in other parties to such contracts than\n            the contractors, and the presumption is obvious and strong that the men signing such a contract as we\n            have here protected themselves against such delays as are complained of by the higher price exacted\n            for the work.”\n\nId. (quoting Wells Bros. Co. v. United States, 254 U.S. 83, 87, 41 S.Ct. 34, 65 L.Ed. 148 (1920)).\n\nThus, in R.F. Ball, we noted that the common-law exceptions to no-damages-for-delay provisions are “generally recognized”\nand, further, we analyzed one of the exceptions—that the “delay which was not intended or contemplated by the parties to be\nwithin the purview of the provision.” *850 Id. at 77. However, we did not apply the exception because the contractor “ha[d]\nnot established that the [no-damages-for-delay] clause was not intended to apply to unforeseen delays and hindrances and that\nit was only intended to apply to foreseeable ones.” Id. at 78.\n\nHere, the exceptions applied by the trial court addressed: “delay or hindrance that was the result of the Port’s actions, if any,\nthat constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.” Under R.F. Ball, then, we must\ndetermine whether Zachry established that the no-damages-for-delay clause at issue was not intended to apply to delay or\nhindrance that was the result of the Port’s actions. The plain language of the pertinent portion of the provision is as follows:\n“arising out of or associated with any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance\nincluding events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM, ARISES OUT OF\nOR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF\nTHE PORT AUTHORITY.” Thus, the parties’ agreement states there are no damages for delay “regardless of the source.”\n\nFurther, though the parties had already stated that the source of the delay was immaterial, they gave emphasis to their intent\nthat delay due even in part to conduct by the Port was something they were specifically contemplating. And, as if specific\nmention might be insufficient, the parties typed the matters regarding conduct by the Port in all capital letters, which set it\napart from the remainder of the paragraph. Finally, to give utmost emphasis, the parties described three categories of fault:\n(1) negligence, (2) breach of contract; or (3) other fault.\n[4]\n   We know that the delay or hindrance damages were caused, at least in part, by breach of contract. By its response to\nQuestion Nos. 1 and 2, the jury determined that the Port breached the contract—both Change Order 4 and section 5.10 of the\ncontract. The jury answered Question No. 3 by finding damages “that resulted from” the breach in the amount of\n$18,602,697. By the parties’ agreement regarding Question No. 4, the evidence conclusively established that 100% of those\ndamages are delay or hindrance damages. Thus, 100% of the delay or hindrance suffered by Zachry resulted from the conduct\nof the Port, that is, breach of contract. In accord with R.F. Ball, we conclude that Zachry has failed to establish that the\nno-damages-for-delay clause was not intended to apply to the Port’s breach of contract.\n\nThe jury was not asked to make a specific finding on whether the Port’s conduct “constituted arbitrary and capricious\nconduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.” However, we conclude that even a specific jury finding would not\ninterfere with the application of the no-damages-for-delay clause in this case. By the parties’ emphasis on “other fault” to the\nspecific exclusion of “negligence,” the parties have communicated their intent that Port conduct that rises above mere\nnegligence or is a departure from the standard of care does not preclude enforcement of the no-damages-for-delay clause.\nAgain, in keeping with R.F. Ball, we conclude that Zachry has failed to establish that the no-damages-for-delay clause was\nnot intended to apply to Port conduct including, arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith, or fraud.\n\nAs harsh as this result seems, Texas law respects the objective intent of the parties where contract provisions show that the\nparties contemplated delay when entering *851 into the contract. See United States ex rel. Straus Sys., Inc. v. Associated\nIndem. Co., 969 F.2d 83, 85 (5th Cir.1992) (citing R.F. Ball Constr. Co., 570 S.W.2d at 77). Here, the parties clearly\ncontemplated that delay, even due to the Port’s conduct, was a possibility and negotiated accordingly. Moreover, parties to a\ncontract might foresee or consider the possibility of delay and contractually provide for a remedy to be applied upon such\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Here, the parties did just that by agreeing that, in case of\ndelay, Zachry’s “sole remedy in any such case shall be an extension of time.” We need not go so far as to hold, as some\ncourts of other jurisdictions do, that because the parties provided a remedy for delay, such remedy is the exclusive remedy.\nSee id.

Instead, “[p]arties to a contract are\nmasters of their own choices and are entitled to select what terms and provisions to include in or omit from a contract.”\nThedford Crossing, L.P. v. Tyler Rose Nursery, Inc., 306 S.W.3d 860, 867 (Tex.App.-Tyler 2010, pet. denied) (citing\nBirnbaum v. SWEPI LP, 48 S.W.3d 254, 257 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2001, pet. denied)). Specifically, “[the parties] are\nentitled to select what terms and provisions to include in a contract before executing it. And, in so choosing, each is entitled\nto rely upon the words selected to demarcate their respective obligations and rights. In short, the parties strike the deal they\nchoose to strike and, thus, voluntarily bind themselves in the manner they choose.” Natural Gas Clearinghouse v. Midgard\nEnergy Co., 113 S.W.3d 400, 407 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2003, pet. denied) (citing Cross Timbers Oil Co. v. Exxon Corp., 22\nS.W.3d 24, 26 (Tex.App.-Amarillo 2000, no pet.)) (emphasis in original).\n\nZachry argues that if we do not apply the common-law exceptions to the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause, then the\ncontract would be unbreachable and illusory. Zachry asserts, for example, that the Port could force Zachry to switch its\nmeans and methods and thereby cause serious delays in Zachry’s performance. Zachry also avers that the Port could create a\ndelay that lasts in perpetuity and then grant Zachry an extension of time that lasts in perpetuity, thereby breaching the\ncontract while leaving Zachry with no remedy. However, the parties are free to negotiate and agree upon the conditions under\nwhich (1) the contractor will recover damages for delay, and (2) another remedy is available to the contractor for any such\ndelay. In June 2004, Zachry unambiguously agreed that it would perform the contract without the benefit of delay damages,\neven if the delay was caused by the Port’s breach of contract, negligence, or other fault. Zachry faced significant delays;\ndelays it alleged—and the jury agreed—were caused by the Port’s breach of contract. In November 2005, Zachry *852\nproceeded with construction “in the wet,” knowing the contract afforded no damages for delay. We cannot rewrite the\nprovision without depriving the Port of the benefit of the bargain the parties reached in June 2004.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the no-damages-for-delay clause in the parties’ contract precludes Zachry’s recovery of damages\nfor its R & R claim. We sustain Issue 4A.4\n\n4\n              In Issue 4B, the Port further asserts that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding of any\n              common law “exceptions” included in the court’s charge that could be recognized under Texas law. However, we need not address\n              those arguments in light of our disposition of Issue 4A.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             B. Liquidated Damages\n\nBy Issue 9A, the Port also seeks reversal of the judgment for liquidated damages. The Port began withholding liquidated\ndamages of $20,000 per day for Zachry’s failure to meet Milestone A and the Wharf’s final completion pursuant to sections\n5.05 and 5.06 of the contract.5 The trial court determined that the Port’s withholding liquidated damages constituted a failure\nto comply with the contract. The Port does not appeal that ruling. Rather, the Port argues that any failure to comply with the\ncontract by withholding liquidated damages was excused because Zachry released such claims as a matter of law.\n\n5\n              Section 5.05 is entitled “Time of Completion and Liquidated Damages,” while section 5.06 is entitled “Actual Damages in Lieu of\n              Liquidated Damages.” The Port does not appear to complain about the trial court’s invalidation of sections 5.05 and 5.06.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\n       points out that the Port does not appeal the directed verdict that the Port breached the contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36\n       million based on an invalid liquidated damages clause. In its October 5, 2009 order, the trial court held that section 5.06—the\n       liquidated damages provision—is an unenforceable penalty because it does not make clear that the liquidated damages are in lieu\n       of other damages.\n\n\n\nThe trial court charged the jury that the Port had failed to comply with the contract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated\ndamages. The trial court also charged the jury in Question No. 12 that the failure to comply would be excused to the extent of\nany dollar amounts as to which Zachry had released its claim for withholding liquidated damages.6 Specifically, the trial court\ninstructed the jury to determine “the meaning” of the “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction\nCorporation” pertaining to Payment Estimate Nos. 21–31 in the context of whether the “[f]ailure to comply by the Port is\nexcused” by the doctrine of release. The jury answered “No.” Thus, in order to prevail here, the Port must conclusively\nestablish that Zachry released its claim for sums withheld as liquidated damages.\n\n6\n       The trial court instructed the jury in Question No. 12 regarding excuse as to release:\n            You may also find excuse if you find, by a preponderance of the evidence [,] that Zachry released its claim for the failure to\n            comply.\n         The court also instructed the jury in Question No. 12 regarding excuse as to offset and/or withholding regarding the fenders. The\n         jury’s finding that the Port is excused for the withholding to the extent of $970,000 for the fenders is addressed in Zachry’s\n         cross-appeal.\n\n\n\nSection 6 of the contract governs the parties’ rights and responsibilities regarding payments on the agreement. Section 6.01\nprovides the Contractor’s obligation to create a “Schedule of Costs,” which includes the unit-price basis for all of the various\nitems of work that “shall be the basis for the preparation of and submission of monthly estimates.”\n\n*853 The parties’ payment exhibits confirm this procedure for payment. Zachry submitted its monthly invoice package,\nwhich included a “Payment Estimate—Contract Performance.” Each of Zachry’s Payment Estimate forms identified items of\nwork completed during the period; represented the percentage of the unit that was complete; and requested payment for the\nwork completed that month. By item 12, each Payment Estimate form was “presented for payment” by a representative of\nZachry. By item 13, the construction manager verified the completion status claimed for the period at issue and approved the\nrequest for payment. Item 14 set out categories of deductions—A through N—for items such as prior payments, contractual\nretainage, and “other deductions.” Items 14(C) and 14(M) are “previous liquidated damages” and “liquidated damages this\nperiod.”\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Port faxed a letter to Zachry stating that the Port was (1) “process[ing] [Zachry’s] March 2006 ...\ninvoice” and (2) deducting, from payment on that invoice, “[l]iquidated damages total[ing] $820,000, based on 41 calendar\ndays from February 16 through March 28, 2006 at $20,000 per calendar day.” Zachry’s March 2006 invoice corresponded to\nZachry’s Payment Estimate No. 23. By that Payment Estimate, Zachry sought a total payment of $1,885,807.26. The Port\nwithheld $820,000 in liquidated damages from payment on Zachry’s Payment Estimate No. 23.\n\nNevertheless, on May 17, 2006, Zachry signed an Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction Corporation\nas follows:\n\n            ZCC hereby acknowledges and certifies that Port of Houston Authority (PHA) has made partial\n            payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Twenty-three (23) and that it has no\n            further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs\n            in Payment Number Twenty-three (23).\n\nFor the period February/March, 2006 through November, 2006, the Port withheld a total of $2.205 million in liquidated\ndamages. In connection with each of these Payment Estimate–Contract Performance forms, Zachry executed an “Affidavit\nand Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction Corporation.” The chart that follows depicts the Payment Estimate\nnumber, the period covered, the total liquidated damages withheld, and the date of the Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien:\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Subsequent Partial Release and Indemnity documents reflect that the\n       PHA estimate numbers are not the “Payment Estimate” numbers referenced in each release.\n\n\n\nThe Port argues that, by signing the May 17, 2006 release, as well as releases covering invoices through November 2006\n(Payment Estimate Nos. 23–31), Zachry, *854 as a matter of law, released its claim to $2.205 million in liquidated damages,\nwhich the Port withheld cumulatively from payment on those invoices/Payment Estimates. Therefore, according to the Port,\nany failure to comply with the contract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages is excused to the extent of $2.205\nmillion. Zachry counters that each release, styled “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien,” unambiguously released nothing\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

See Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 955\nS.W.2d 120, 127 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1997), aff’d sub nom., Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of\nPittsburg, Pa., 20 S.W.3d 692 (Tex.2000). Releases are subject to the usual rules of contract construction. Id. As in other\ninstances of contract construction, our primary concern is to ascertain the intent of the parties at the time of the execution of\nthe alleged release as expressed in the release. See generally In re Serv. Corp. Int’l, 355 S.W.3d at 661; Epps, 351 S.W.3d at\n865.\n\n           To construe the release, we may examine evidence of the circumstances surrounding the negotiation and execution\n[11] [12] [13]\n\nof the release. See Baty v. ProTech Ins. Agency, 63 S.W.3d 841, 848 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied); see\nalso Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.1981) (holding the proper rule is that “evidence of\nsurrounding circumstances may be consulted” and, “[i]f in light of the surrounding circumstances, the language of the\ncontract appears to be capable of only a single meaning, the court can then confine itself to the writing”). We may also\nconsider “the deletions made by the parties” in the course of drafting the instrument at issue. See Houston Pipe Line Co. v.\nDwyer, 374 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex.1964). Finally, we may consider the title of the document, but such is not dispositive.\nEnter. Leasing Co. of Houston v. Barrios, 156 S.W.3d 547, 549 (Tex.2004) (per curiam) (“Although we recognize that in\ncertain cases, courts may consider the title of a contract provision or section to interpret a contract, ‘the greater weight must\nbe given to the operative contractual clauses of the agreement.’ ” (quoting Neece v. A.A.A. Realty Co., 159 Tex. 403, 322\nS.W.2d 597, 600 (1959))).8\n\n8\n            Zachry points out that the word “release” appears only once—in the title, immediately followed by “of lien,” and argues that title\n            may be considered in determining intent.\n\n\n\n   For a release to be effective, it must “mention” the claim to be released. Victoria Bank & Trust Co. v. Brady, 811 S.W.2d\n[14]\n\n931, 938 (Tex.1991). However, the release need not specifically describe a particular cause of action. See Mem’l Med. Ctr. of\nE. Tex. v. Keszler, 943 S.W.2d 433, 434–35 (Tex.1997) (per curiam).\n\n        We begin with the plain language of the release at issue. Its title is “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry\n[15] [16]\n\nConstruction Corporation.” It states that Zachry “has no further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed\nand listed on the Schedule of Costs” in the respective Payment Estimate. The body of the document contains neither the word\n“release” nor the word “lien.”9 Yet, the plain language of the *855 sworn statement unambiguously avers that the Port has\npaid “all sums owing” on the Payment Estimate at issue and that Zachry has “no further claims against PHA for the portion\nof the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs” in the Payment Estimate at issue. Zachry’s proposed\ninterpretation of these words to mean “no liens” rather than “no further claims” is not a reasonable interpretation of the\nlanguage.\n\n9\n            That the body of the provision does not contain the word “release” or “lien” or traditional boilerplate associated with releases or\n            liens is not dispositive of our analysis. Even where the parties’ agreement does not contain the term “release,” “the intent of the\n            parties controls, and the legal effect of the instrument may be a general release.” Knutson v. Morton Foods, Inc., 603 S.W.2d 805,\n            811 (Tex.1980) (Denton, J., concurring) (citing W. PROSSER, HANDBOOK OF THE LAW OF TORTS, § 49 at 303 (4th ed.\n            1971)). Zachry provides and we find no authority for the proposition that an agreement cannot legally release a claim unless it uses\n            the word “release.” In fact, if Zachry were correct, then an agreement to “voluntarily relinquish a right known to me” could not\n            operate as a waiver because the magic word is not uttered. We believe such an artificial approach to construing agreements\n            between parties finds no support in Texas law and would be contrary to the primary purpose of contract interpretation-determining\n            the parties’ intent.\n\n\n\nThe parties also rely on surrounding circumstances to construe the release. Specifically, they compare the language of the\nrelease at issue to both the prior and subsequent release forms. Even if we accept the invitation to look beyond the four\ncorners of the affidavit at issue, these surrounding circumstances do not support Zachry’s proposed interpretation of the\nlanguage at issue.\n\n                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

This litigation is styled Cause No.2006–72970, Zachry\n     Construction Corporation v. the Port of Houston Authority, pending in the 151st Judicial District Court of Harris County,\n     Texas (the “Lawsuit”). Each of Zachry Construction Corporation and the Port of Houston Authority agrees that Zachry\n     Construction Corporation’s execution of this Lien Release for pay Estimate No. [ ] does not in any way release or modify\n     the parties’ rights and obligations under the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract or constitute a release of any claim or\n     claims that the parties may present in the Lawsuit with respect to Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.\n\nThus, the first form included, in addition to the release language at issue here, broad, general release language that purported\nto cover “all causes of action” including legal or equitable, common-law or statutory claims arising in contract, tort, or\nproperty rights. The parties deleted this general release language from the second version of the release at issue here. And,\nwhen litigation ensued, the parties revised the form again to reinsert general release language, but to specifically except the\nclaims in this suit. Still, the third version contained the release language at issue here. Thus, the “deletion” gives no support\nto Zachry’s argument that the release was transformed into a mere release of lien.10\n\n10\n          Zachry stresses that “the second version deleted the general release language.” (emphasis in original). Zachry contends that “[t]he\n          deletion of the general release language in the second lien release version—the version on which the Port relies—shows the second\n          version was not a general release.” Id. at 70. Zachry’s reliance upon Houston Pipe Line Co., 374 S.W.2d at 664, and Hall v. Lone\n          Star Gas Co., 954 S.W.2d 174, 176 (Tex.App.-Austin 1997, pet. denied), for that argument blurs an important distinction between\n          deletions and omissions in this context. To be precise, the language upon which Zachry focuses was not deleted in the sense of\n          appearing on a preprinted form and then being stricken through using an “x” or some other mark visible on the face of the\n          document. See, e.g., Houston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462, 466 (Tex.2011);\n          Houston Pipe Line Co., 374 S.W.2d at 663; Gibson v. Turner, 156 Tex. 289, 294 S.W.2d 781, 782 (1956). The language upon\n          which Zachry focuses was omitted from the operative version of the document but appeared in other versions. There is reason to\n          question how much weight properly can be given to omitted language from other versions of the document in light of the parol\n          evidence rule.

And while we have looked at a prior policy in deciding between\n         reasonable constructions of a current one, we have never done so in lieu of construing the current one at all.”)\n\n\n\nFurther, the parties point to section 6.07 of the contract to guide the interpretation of the release. Section 6.07 required Zachry\nto release any further “claim[s] for payment” as to Zachry’s prior invoice/Payment Estimate.11 It further provides, in *857\npertinent part, that such waivers and releases of liens shall provide, “at a minimum, that all amounts due and payable to the\nContractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier, as of the date of such invoice ... have been paid in full.” Zachry relies\non the “to the extent set out in the preceding sentence” language as an indication that the contract did not require it to release\na claim that payment had not been made in full; just a release of any lien arising out of the failure to do so. The Port urges\nthat the subject provision unambiguously released any further claim for payment for the work accomplished and billed on the\nrelevant payment estimate and, thus, released any claim that there was no payment in full by virtue of a liquidated damages\noffset. Zachry argues that the subject provision unambiguously released nothing more than claims for payment to assure an\neffective release of liens. Once the parties eliminated the “general release language,” Zachry insists it no longer released its\nbreach of contract claim with each payment.\n\n11\n         Section 6.07 of the contract states, in pertinent part:\n              As a condition precedent to the obligation of the Port Authority to make payment on any invoice, the Contractor shall supply\n              the Port Authority with waivers and releases of liens (including without limitation all mechanics’ and materialmens’ liens and\n              any other type of security interest), which waivers and releases shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the Contractor\n              and each Subcontractor and Supplier expecting payment from [the] Contractor in respect of such invoice in order to assure an\n              effective release of such liens to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. The waivers and releases of liens shall\n              provide, at a minimum, that all amounts due and payable to the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier, as of\n              the date of such invoice and as of the date of the last payment received by the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and\n              Supplier have been paid in full and that the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier waives, releases and\n              relinquishes any lien (including without limitation any mechanic’s or materialman’s lien), security interest and claim for\n              payment to the extent set out the preceding sentence.\n\n\n[17]\n    Zachry’s construction of version two of the release is inconsistent with the surrounding circumstances. First, as\nmentioned, the only reference to “lien” is the heading of the affidavit. It cannot be limiting language, however, because it is\nthe same heading for each of the three versions, including the first version that Zachry admits operated as a broad release of\nclaims.12 Second, section 6.07 does not provide a limiting circumstance. Although section 6.07 may not require Zachry to\nrelease anything more than liens arising from failure to make payment, even Zachry acknowledges that it released far more in\nconnection with version one because version one mentions claims, including liens. Similarly, version two mentions claims,\nnot liens, for the portion of the Work completed and listed. As such, any limitation of section 6.07 is not a limitation on our\nconstruction of the release provision.\n\n12\n         A broad, general release releases every potential cause of action pertaining to the subject matter. See Keck, Mahin & Cate, 20\n         S.W.3d at 698.\n\n\n\nWe conclude the provision is subject to one reasonable interpretation, that is: the provision at issue (version two) releases any\nfurther claim for payment for work accomplished and billed by the relevant payment estimate, which also operates to release\nany lien for that same work because payment is made in full. Because the general release language is omitted, the provision\ndoes not release:\n\n       • claims arising in tort;\n\n       • claims to adjudicate property rights;\n\n       • claims for any and all causes of action, claims, demand, debts, liabilities, *858 expenses, or costs of any kind and\n       every character and nature whatsoever; or\n\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\n       • all claims for breach of contract.\n\nBut, even without the general release language, the specific release language of version two releases claims for breach of\ncontract predicated upon a failure to make payment for work accomplished, billed, and paid—in whole or in part—on a\nparticular payment estimate.\n\nOur dissenting colleague concludes that the Port has failed to establish release as a matter of law because the documents at\nissue are, at a minimum, ambiguous. Meticulously comparing the release documents to the Payment Estimates at issue, the\ndissent urges that the release leaves open the question of what document is referenced in each release. Such asserted\nambiguity is not one argued by Zachry, however. Zachry does not urge that the releases do not match the payment estimates.\nZachry does not urge that the term Payment Estimate is ambiguous in its reference to Zachry’s payment estimates rather than\nthe Port’s. Zachry does not urge that the absence of evidence identifying a payment release seeking payment in the same\nquantity released defeats the release. To the contrary, Zachry urges that the release is a release to the full extent of the\npayment estimates; it simply urges that the release is a full release of lien, rather than a full release of payment.\n[18]\n     Moreover, there is no ambiguity in “what exactly has been released” as the dissent suggests. The language of the release\ngoes beyond saying Zachry has no further claims against PHA. The release says “[Zachry] has no further claims against PHA\nfor the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Number –––.” (emphasis added).\nIt is undisputed on this record that the Port had already withheld all of the liquidated damages that it ever did withhold by the\ntime Zachry signed the subject release in January 2007. Thus, it released any further claim for the work that had been\ncompleted and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate 31. Texas law requires identification of the claim to be\nreleased—not quantification.\n\nIn summary, we conclude that, when Zachry signed the “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien,” stating that the Port “has\nmade partial payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Thirty (30) and that it has no further claims\nagainst PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number 30,”\nZachry unambiguously discharged or released the Port from any further duty or obligation to pay sums billed through\nPayment Estimate No. 29. See Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa., 955 S.W.2d at 127. The “Affidavit and Partial\nRelease of Lien” mentions the claims being released: “claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed\non the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number 30.” See Victoria Bank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at 938. As Payment\nEstimate No. 30 included offsets for liquidated damages in the sum of $2.205 million, Zachry has no further claims for\npayment arising from the work completed and listed on that Payment Estimate.\n\nWe conclude that if the Port failed to comply with the contract by withholding liquidated damages, such failure was excused,\nin part, as a matter of law by Zachry’s release.13 We sustain the Port’s Issue 9A.\n\n13\n         The Port also raises the same release argument in response to Zachry’s issue on cross-appeal regarding the $600,000 withheld for\n         dredging. For the same reason we sustain the Port’s Issue 9A, we overrule Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 1A and B, in which\n         Zachry claims that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the $600,000 withheld for dredging. The jury found in Question\n         No. 9 that the Port did not fail to comply with the contract by withholding $600,000 for dredging. Zachry’s claim to recover the\n         $600,000 for dredging is barred by release as a matter of law, just the same as the $2.205 million in liquidated damages withheld\n         from invoice payments addressed above.\n\n\n\n\n                                           *859 C. $970,000 Offset for Defective Fenders\n\nThe Port claimed a right under section 6.05 of the contract to withhold or offset certain liquidated damage amounts because\nof alleged damages related to Wharf fenders. Question No. 12A asked the jury whether the Port’s failure to comply with the\ncontract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages was excused, in whole or part, “by offset and/or withholding”\nfor Zachry’s failure to comply with the contract with respect to fender corrosion.14 The jury found that the Port was entitled to\nwithhold or offset for fender damage in the amount of $970,000. The trial court entered judgment on Zachry’s R & R claim,\nbut offset the $970,000 against Zachry’s damage award.\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\n\n14\n         The trial court instructed the jury in Question No. 12 regarding excuse as to offset and/or withholding:\n              You may find excuse if you find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Port is entitled to withhold for fenders under §\n              6.05 of the General Conditions of the Contract and/or that the Port is entitled to offset for fenders under § 6.17 of the General\n              Conditions of the Contract.\n              The Port is entitled to withhold and/or offset for fenders under these provisions if you find, by a preponderance of the\n              evidence, that, with respect to the fenders, Zachry failed to comply with the Contract resulting in a loss to the Port.\n\n\n\nBy its Cross–Appeal Issue 2, Zachry contends that it is entitled to judgment rendered in its favor on the $970,000 because the\nevidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s findings (1) that Zachry breached the contract in\nconstructing the fenders, (2) that any breach caused the fenders’ corrosion and the Port’s damage, or (3) as to any amount of\ndamages the Port suffered as a result. Although we agree that (a) the presentation of evidence on the fenders was brief and\nnot emphasized with the jury; and (b) there is competing evidence on the subject, we disagree that that evidence is legally or\nfactually insufficient.\n[19]\n    In reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the fact finding,\ncrediting favorable evidence if reasonable persons could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable persons could\nnot. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822, 827 (Tex.2005). We may not sustain a legal sufficiency, or “no evidence”\npoint unless the record demonstrates that: (1) there is a complete absence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by the rules of\nlaw or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) the evidence to prove a vital fact is\nno more than a scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively established the opposite of the vital fact. Id. at 810. To evaluate the\nfactual sufficiency of the evidence, we consider all the evidence and will set aside the finding only if the evidence supporting\nthe finding is so weak or so against the overwhelming weight of the evidence that the finding is clearly wrong and unjust.\nMaritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406–07 (Tex.1998); Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex.1986) (per\ncuriam).\n\nThe Port’s Bayport engineer Mark Vincent testified about the Wharf fenders, *860 which had a life expectancy of 30 years\nbut corroded within 90 days. He stated that the Port incurred damages in the approximate amount of $978,000 for “recoating”\nrepairs. He also noted that the Port sent a warranty deficiency notice to Zachry on the fenders but Zachry refused to repair\nthem.\n[20]\n    The coating at issue is governed by Technical Specification Section 09950. The jury received evidence that (a) this\nspecification requires Zachry to “apply 2–3 mils of the specified epoxy” coating; and (b) “[t]hickness tests conducted on the\nupper portion of the fenders ranged from 18 to 26 mils including the seal coat.” From this evidence, the jury was entitled to\ninfer that Zachry applied coating well above the 2–3 mils level specified by the contract. Thus, the evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding that Zachry failed to comply with the contract and, specifically, Technical\nSpecification Section 09950.\n[21]\n    The jury also heard evidence that the purpose of the above technical specification on coating is “to obtain full continuity\nof the epoxy and total sealing of porosity.” The fenders were to be sealed because a portion of each fender is installed under\nwater. By his report,15 admitted without objection, Stephen Pinney, an engineer hired by the Port to inspect the fenders,\nindicated that his personal inspection revealed that the three-foot portion of the fenders submerged “failed down to the bare\nsteel” but that the portion of the fenders “above the splash zone” remained intact. Pinney stated that the most probable cause\nof the failure is:\n\n15\n         Zachry cites no case, and we find none, to support Zachry’s suggestion that if documentary evidence is “not discussed by any\n         witness” or “otherwise brought to the jury’s attention,” it may be discounted or disregarded on appellate review.\n\n\n\n\n       • the seal coat applied to the metalizing was insufficiently thinned;\n\n            • because the seal coat was insufficiently thinned, it was not able to penetrate into the porous metalized aluminum\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Zachry urges that this testimony is legally insufficient16 because at no point does Vincent or any other witness\nprovide an opinion that $970,000 is the “reasonable and necessary” cost to repair the fenders. The Port counters that the cost\nto repair the fenders need not be “reasonable and necessary” where, as here, the contract itself does not require that the loss\nbe “reasonable and necessary.”\n\n16\n       Zachry also argues that, even if the damages evidence is sufficient, the court should reverse and remand for a new trial, as the trial\n       court failed to instruct the jury that it could only award “reasonable and necessary” damages. We address these points together.\n\n\n\n*861 We agree with the Port and conclude that the trial court did not err with regard to the jury charge. For this court to\nimply a requirement that the costs to repair be “reasonable and necessary” would be tantamount to modifying the contract.\nSee Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Marshall, 699 S.W.2d 896, 902 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1985), aff’d, 724 S.W.2d 770\n(Tex.1987); see also Simien v. Unifund CCR Partners, 321 S.W.3d 235, 248 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\nZachry’s authority is inapposite as it pertains to interpreting an oral contract. See Walker & Assocs. Surveying, Inc. v. Austin,\n301 S.W.3d 909, 919 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2009, no pet.) (ascertaining the terms of an oral contract where there was “little\nor no agreement reached about the level of competence of the workers provided”). Therefore, the jury’s determination of\n$970,000 as the cost to repair the fender is supported by Vincent’s testimony about $978,000–worth of repairs.\n\nWe overrule Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 2 regarding the Wharf fender offset award.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          D. Attorney’s Fees\n\nIn Issue 11, the Port argues that it is entitled to the attorney’s fees found by the jury for the R & R and withholding claims\nbecause the Port is entitled to judgment on those claims.\n\nZachry brought multiple claims or theories of the Port’s breach of the contract: the R & R claim, i.e., failure to comply with\nChange Order 4 and section 5.10 of the contract, and claims for withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages and\n$600,000 for dredging. The jury determined that a “reasonable fee for necessary services of the Port’s attorneys” on\n“Zachry’s Claim Relating to Change Order 4 and/or § 5.10 of the Contract” is $10,500,000 for trial; $90,000 for an appeal to\nthe court of appeals; and $22,500 for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. The jury determined that a reasonable fee for\n“Zachry’s Claim for Withholding the $2.36 million as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging” is $80,250 for\ntrial; $3,750 for an appeal to the court of appeals; and $1,250.00 for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nSection 3.10 of the contract makes Zachry liable for the Port’s attorney’s fees if Zachry brings “a claim” and “does not\nprevail with respect to such claim.”17 We have determined that Zachry has not prevailed with respect to “Zachry’s Claim\nRelating to Change Order 4 and/or § 5.10 of the Contract.” We also have determined that Zachry has not prevailed with\nrespect to “Zachry’s Claim for Withholding the $2.36 million as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging,” i.e., we\nhave sustained the Port’s Issue 9A that the Port’s withholding liquidated damages was excused by $2.205 million of the\n$2.36 million damages awarded, and we have overruled Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 2 on the Port’s $970,000 offset of the\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nsum awarded for liquidated damages. Having determined that Zachry did not prevail on the three claims or theories presented\nto the jury, we need not determine whether Zachry brought one or two or three claims.18 We need only determine whether\n*862 the sums awarded by the jury for the Port’s reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees are supported by factually\nsufficient evidence.\n\n17\n       Section 3.10 states:\n            If Contractor brings any claim against the Port Authority and Contractor does not prevail with respect to such claim,\n            Contractor shall be liable for all attorney’s fees incurred by the Port Authority as a result of such claim.\n\n\n\n18\n       If the Port had succeeded on appeal on only the judgment for the R & R claim, Zachry claims that the Port would not be entitled to\n       any attorney’s fees on the R & R claim because Zachry would still have prevailed on its breach of contract claim. That is, Zachry\n       argues that it brought one breach of contract claim, but different theories of breach: R & R damages and withholding damages. The\n       Port contends that Zachry brought multiple claims, entitling the Port to the segregated attorney’s fees on the R & R claim if a\n       take-nothing judgment is rendered on the R & R claim, but not the withholding claims. However, because Zachry has not prevailed\n       on any of its “claims” or “theories,” we need not address these arguments.\n\n\n\nBy Cross–Appeal Issue 3, Zachry contends that in the event that Zachry does not prevail on any theory underlying its\nbreach-of-contract claim, Zachry would still be entitled to a new trial on attorney’s fees. In support of its claim for attorney’s\nfees, the Port offered the testimony of its billing attorney, Karen White, and its designated attorney’s fees expert, Dan\nDowney. Zachry claims that (1) the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of White because she was not designated as\nan attorney’s fees expert; and (2) Downey’s testimony is factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding on the amount of\nthe Port’s attorney’s fees.\n\nWe first address whether the trial court erred in admitting White’s testimony. Prior to White’s testifying, the trial court ruled\nthat she could testify as a fact witness, but not as an expert because she had not been designated as an expert.19 That is, White\nwould not be allowed to testify as the reasonableness of the segregation of the attorney’s fees. Zachry complains here that\nWhite did, in fact, provide expert testimony. The Port urges that Zachry waived any objection to White’s testimony by failing\nto obtain a ruling.\n\n19\n       Specifically, the trial court ordered that White could “testify as a fact witness only and without reference to these billing records,\n       period, the end.... And so no reference to the billing records and no opinions.” In response to Zachry’s counsel’s clarification that\n       White would “only testify as to the methodology by which this segregation and she [will] not be given [sic] any kind of an opinion\n       as to the reasonableness of segregation. That would be Mr. Downey,” the trial court responded, “Right.”\n\n\n[23]\n    During White’s testimony, Zachry objected twice that White’s testimony was drifting into expert opinions. The first\noccurred when White, after describing the document production process, stated “[w]e didn’t feel that they had produced\nevery document to us that they should have....” Zachry “object[ed] at this point” because White was to be “a very limited fact\nwitness, not an expert,” and was being tendered as a witness for the “limited purpose of segregation. That is, to tell us exactly\nhow the segregation of the fees was identified and determined.” The trial court overruled the objection, stating that it would\n“let White testify about these subjects.” White provided further testimony on the document-production process, including the\nhuge volume of documents produced by each side and the process for reviewing those documents. We find the trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in ruling that document-production testimony was not expert testimony.\n\nThe second objection occurred during White’s response the question: “[W]hat was your role as a billing attorney?” White\nexplained the process of inputting time and then stated that, “as billing attorney, then I review the bills to make sure that\neverything’s properly chargeable to the client, that it’s properly....” Zachry’s counsel objected, again complaining about the\ntestimony in light of the trial court’s expert-opinion ruling. The trial court agreed that when White “talks about whether a\nparticular item was properly billable to the client,” she is offering an *863 opinion. Therefore, the Port agreed to “ask Ms.\nWhite not to add whether something was properly billable to the client.” Thus, the trial court did not make a ruling adverse to\nZachry or otherwise deny Zachry relief.20\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\n20\n       Although Zachry mentions the Port’s failure to disclose fee statements as a basis for excluding White’s testimony, the trial court\n       did not rule on this objection because the Port’s attorney withdrew the pending question. Therefore, we do not address that\n       argument.\n\n\n\nWe now address Zachry’s complaint that the testimony of the Port’s expert, Dan Downy, was not factually sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s findings on attorney’s fees.21 Downey opined that the attorney’s fees incurred by the Port were reasonable\nand necessary, and that the fees were properly segregated. The jury heard about the Port’s process for compiling factual data\non attorneys’ services rendered. Port paralegal Holly Gray searched the computerized records with certain search terms and\ncreated a spreadsheet that included all of the hours and times for any entry that “had any of the terms in it.” Gray provided\nthat spreadsheet to Downey.\n\n21\n       Downey testified that he had been a Harris County trial judge from 1988 to 1994, and had been a lawyer or judge in Texas for\n       about 33 years. Downey further stated that he had not testified previously as an attorney’s fees expert in any cases other than his\n       own and that, as a trial judge, attorney’s fees did not frequently come before him as a contested issue.\n\n\n\nDowney identified the bases for his opinions as to the reasonableness and necessity of the Port’s legal fees. In addition to the\nspreadsheet, Downey reviewed the pleading and discovery index and requested to see particular pleadings and motions “so\n[he] could get a handle on what was involved.” Downey then conducted separate interviews with individual attorneys\ninvolved in the case concerning “what their role was and how they set about performing that task.” Downey “was trying to\nget a handle on how much work is involved in those tasks, to see if it makes sense and matches up with the time that they\nhave logged for those tasks.” Downey interviewed the attorneys more than once. Downey also interviewed the legal\nassistants. The jury saw several exhibits containing Downey’s notes as well as compilations of fees by month and attorney.\n\nZachry’s attorney’s fees expert, William Junell, agreed that the lawsuit between Zachry and the Port amounted to an\n“all-out-war between the parties for ... three years.”22 However, Junell disagreed with Downey’s opinion on the\nreasonableness and necessity of the fees incurred by the Port.\n\n22\n       Junell testified that he had been practicing law for over 38 years and had served as an expert witness on attorney’s fees\n       approximately a dozen times.\n\n\n\n   Both Junell and Downey testified about the factors applicable to an attorney’s fee award.23 The jury heard that the *864\n[24]\n\nPort’s fees were two-and-a-half times more than Zachry’s in October 2008. That “raised red flags in [Junell’s] mind.”\nDowney, however, explained that the primary difference related to the review of documents. Downey was satisfied that the\nwork the Port lawyers performed in reviewing documents “was fair and reasonable and necessary.”\n\n23\n       The factors are (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill required to\n       perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n       employment; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved and the results\n       obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional\n       relationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8)\n       whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been rendered.\n       Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex.1997). This court considers those factors to be guidelines\n       rather than elements of proof. See Academy Corp. v. Interior Buildout & Turnkey Const., Inc., 21 S.W.3d 732, 742\n       (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, no pet.).\n\n\n[25]\n    The jury also heard Junell’s criticism that Downey did not review any of the underlying bills for the 44,000 hours of\nattorney time for which the Port sought recovery.24 Junell testified that “we do not have the required information that tells you\nwhat services were rendered by what lawyers on the occasion in case and at what rate for those services.” But Downey\nexplained that he favored individual interviews over the actual bills because he felt it was likely that the bills contained\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                    23\n\fPort of Houston Authority of Harris County v. Zachry Const. Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nprivileged information and would inadequately explain the activities of the attorneys that he needed to consider. He also\nexplained that he had taken out certain aspects of Port fees that he did not consider appropriate.\n\n24\n       Here, the Port urges that Zachry has waived its sufficiency issue because its complaints are “waived challenges to his\n       methodology.” However, Zachry urges a factual sufficiency challenge to fees, not a legal sufficiency challenge. The Port cites no\n       case, and we find none, that holds that failure to challenge a fee expert’s methodology waives a factual sufficiency complaint on\n       appeal.\n\n\n\nUltimately, through a thorough cross-examination of Downey, Zachry made the jury aware of the weaknesses in the Port’s\nattorney’s fee claim: the Port was seeking $15 million in attorney’s fees to defend Zachry’s $30 million claims; the Port had\nfour separate law firms defending it; Downey had not documented what tasks were performed by each attorney; and Downey\nhad not used actual bills to form his opinion even though that is the standard practice for attorney’s fee witnesses, and though\nthey would have provided some verification of the attorneys’ representation of their time spent.\n[26]\n    We conclude that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the fee award in this case, though the evidence would also\nhave supported far less. The most significant concern about this award is the relationship between the fee awarded and the\namount in controversy, particularly when compared to the fees incurred by Zachry. However, this court has previously\ndetermined, albeit on much smaller sums, that a fee award that was two times the amount in controversy was supported by\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence. See Bencon Mgmt. & Gen. Contracting, Inc. v. Boyer, Inc., 178 S.W.3d 198, 209–10\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) The relationship between the fee and the amount in controversy is merely a\nfactor that we examine. See USAA Cnty. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Cook, 241 S.W.3d 93, 103 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no\npet.). Moreover, the testimony provides sufficient evidence to support this discrepancy. Downey’s and White’s testimony\nillustrated that the majority of the differential occurred in the area of discovery and, specifically, the pursuit and review of\ndocument production. White testified that rather than provide copies of responsive documents to the Port, Zachry asked the\nPort’s attorneys “to come out to the site facility and review documents there.” Thus, two Port attorneys went to an un-air\nconditioned, metal container facility “crammed full of boxes not organized in any manner.” They pulled boxes outside of the\ncontainer, one at a time, “and sat under a tree in May out at the wharf site *865 and reviewed documents searching for things\nthat might be responsive.” While Junell testified about the volume of material reviewed by each side, he spoke of electronic\ndocuments; thus, the jury was free to believe that the method of document production played a role in the number of hours\nthe Port attorneys needed to spend to accomplish the task. We conclude that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding on attorney’s fees.\n\nWe overrule Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, we hold that the application of the no-damages-for-delay clause precludes Zachry’s claim for delay or\nhindrance damages on its claim for damages on its R & R claim.\n\nWe further hold that Zachry released, as a matter of law, $2.205 million of its $2.36 million claim for the Port’s withholding\nliquidated damages. We further hold that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding of the\nPort’s offset of $970,000 for defective fenders. Because the amount of liquidated damages that Zachry released and the\namount of offset the jury found for defective fenders is greater than the $2.36 million that Zachry sought for the Port’s\nwithholding of liquidated damages, we hold that Zachry may not recover on its $2.36 million claim for withholding\nliquidated damages.\n\nWe further hold that the trial court did not err in failing to rule, as a matter of law, that the Port breached the contract by\nwithholding $600,000 for dredging.\n\nWe further hold that the Port is entitled to recover attorney’s fees as found by the jury with respect to Zachry’s R & R claim\nas follows: (1) $10,500,000 for trial, (2) $90,000 for appeal to the court of appeals, and (3) $22,500 for appeal to the Texas\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We render judgment that the Port have and recover\nattorney’s fees from Zachry with respect to the R & R claim as follows: (1) $10,500,000 for trial, (2) $90,000 for appeal to\nthe court of appeals, and (3) $22,500 for appeal to the Texas Supreme Court; and with respect to the withholding claims: (1)\n$80,250 for trial, (2) $3,750 for appeal to the court of appeals, and (3) $1,250 for appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nAccordingly, we render judgment that the Port recover attorney’s fees and reverse and render judgment that Zachry take\nnothing on its claims.\n\n\n\n\nJustice CHRISTOPHER, J., dissenting\n\n*866 TRACY CHRISTOPHER, Justice, dissenting.\n\nI respectfully dissent from Part B of the majority’s opinion, in which liquidated damages are addressed. In my opinion, the\ndocuments titled “Partial Release of Lien” do not release Zachry’s claim for the wrongfully withheld liquidated damages. I\nwould uphold the trial court’s decision that the documents are ambiguous and the jury’s decision that Zachry did not release\nthose damages.\n\nThe majority concludes that the documents at issue are unambiguous. I disagree. Applying the following rules of\nconstruction, I would hold that, at most, the documents are ambiguous and that the issue was properly submitted to the jury. I\nwould consider what a release is, how to construe it, and the special provisions related to releases.\n\n\n\nA. Rules of Construction\n\n\n1. A release extinguishes a claim or cause of action.\n\nA release is a writing providing that a duty or obligation owed to one party to the release is discharged immediately or on the\noccurrence of a condition. See Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 955 S.W.2d 120, 127\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1997), aff’d sub nom. Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 20 S.W.3d 692\n(Tex.2000); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 284 (1981). A release of a claim or cause of action extinguishes the claim\nor cause of action. Dresser Indus., Inc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex.1993).\n\n\n\n2. A release is subject to the rules governing contract construction.\n\nUnder Texas law, a release is a contract and is subject to the rules governing contract construction. See Williams v. Glash,\n789 S.W.2d 261, 264 (Tex.1990) (holding that a release is a contract subject to avoidance on same grounds as any other\ncontract); Loy v.

The primary concern is to ascertain the true intent of the parties.\n\nIn construing a written contract, the primary concern of the court is to ascertain the true intentions of the parties as expressed\nin the instrument. Coker v. Coker, 650 S.W.2d 391, 393 (Tex.1983); Nat’l Union, 955 S.W.2d at 127. The intention of the\nparties is discovered primarily by reference to the words used in the contract. Nat’l Union, 955 S.W.2d at 127. To determine\nthe parties’ intentions, courts should examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all\nthe provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless. Coker, 650 S.W.2d at 393; Nat’l Union, 955 S.W.2d\nat 127. No single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect; rather, all of the provisions must be considered with\nreference to the entire contract. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                  b. The court may consider surrounding circumstances.\n\nEvidence of circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract may be considered in the construction of an\nunambiguous instrument, even though oral statements of the parties’ intentions are inadmissible to vary or contradict the\nterms of the agreement. Med. Towers, Ltd. v. St. Luke’s Episcopal Hosp., 750 S.W.2d 820, 823 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th\nDist.] 1988, writ denied) (citing *867 Sun Oil Co. (Delaware) v. Madeley, 626 S.W.2d 726, 731 (Tex.1982)). The\ncircumstances help to illuminate the contractual language chosen by the parties and enable evaluation of “ ‘the objects and\npurposes intended to be accomplished by them in entering into the contract.’ ” Id. (quoting Garcia v. King, 139 Tex. 578,\n585, 164 S.W.2d 509, 512 (1942)). A contract should be construed by determining how the “reasonable person” would have\nused and understood such language, considering the circumstances surrounding its negotiation and keeping in mind the\npurposes intended to be accomplished by the parties when entering into the contract. Nat’l Union, 955 S.W.2d at 128 (citing\nManzo v. Ford, 731 S.W.2d 673, 676 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1987, no writ)).\n\n\n\n\n                      c. The court may consider other contracts pertaining to the same transaction.\n\nInstruments pertaining to the same transaction should be read together to ascertain the parties’ intent as to the meaning of the\nrelease, even if the parties executed them at different times and the instruments do not expressly refer to each other. See Fort\nWorth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 840 (Tex.2000); In re Sterling Chems., Inc., 261 S.W.3d 805,\n810 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.); Dorsett v.

The court may consider deletions made by the parties.\n\nWe may also consider “the deletions made by the parties” in the course of drafting the instrument at issue. See Hous.\nExploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462, 470–71 (Tex.2011); Hous. Pipe Line Co. v.\nDwyer, 374 S.W.2d 662, 664 (Tex.1964).\n\n\n\n\n                                       e.

Barrios, 156 S.W.3d 547, 549 (Tex.2004) (per\ncuriam) (“Although we recognize that in certain cases, courts may consider the title of a contract provision or section to\ninterpret a contract, ‘the greater weight must be given to the operative contractual clauses of the agreement.’ ” (quoting Neece\nv. A.A.A. Realty Co., 159 Tex. 403, 322 S.W.2d 597, 600 (1959))). The title also can create ambiguity when it differs from\nthe body. See Lone Star Cement Corp. v. Fair, 467 S.W.2d 402, 404–05 (Tex.1971) (when caption of a judicial order\ndismisses only one party while the body purports to dismiss an entire cause, the order is ambiguous); Forbau v.

Specific rules apply to releases.\n\nIn addition to these basic contract construction rules, however, we must take into account the rules that specifically apply to\nreleases.\n\n\n\n\n                               a. A release must specifically mention the claim to be released.\n\nTo effectively release a claim in Texas, the releasing instrument must mention the claim to be released.

Application of the Rules to the Documents at Issue\n\n\n1. There is little evidence about the parties’ intent and surrounding circumstances.\n\nThere was very little testimony at trial about the Partial Release of Liens. As to the intent of the parties and the surrounding\ncircumstances, we know only the following: Zachry initially signed a document (“Release Form No. 1”) containing broad\nrelease language in the body of the document. See majority opinion, ante at 855–56. Beginning in September of 2004, Zachry\nrevised the release agreement, leaving only two paragraphs in the body of the document and deleting the broad release\nlanguage (“Release Form No. 2”).1 In 2007, after all of the liquidated damages had already been withheld, the Port rejected an\ninvoice from Zachry with the note, “not accepted at this time without proper release of lien form.” The lawyers for Zachry\nand the Port then got together and came up with an acceptable release form, which once again included the broad release\nlanguage with a carve-out for all claims in this lawsuit (“Release Form No. 3”). See majority opinion, ante at 856. The Port’s\nwitness, Andy Thiess, called the documents “releases” but claimed that he did not know their legal effect. Zachry’s witness\nJean Abiassi claimed that the releases were only releases of liens, as could be seen by the titles of the documents and section\n6.07 of the contract.\n\n1\n       Although I do not think that Release Form No. 2 should be called a release at all, I will refer to it as a release as the majority has\n       done.\n\n\n\n\n2. The releases refer to other documents.\n\nThe jury was asked to decide whether certain numbered documents released the liquidated-damages claim. Each release\nrefers to another document, and to understand what was being released, it was necessary to know the contents of the\nreferenced document. But, the record contains no testimony matching a release and the document to which it refers. The jury\nreceived no charge instructions about how to match a release with the document to which it refers, and the referenced\ndocuments are not attached to the exhibits in *869 the record. The absence of evidence from which to identify the document\nreferenced in a given release is itself a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the Port has failed to prove anything as a\nmatter of law. While the majority contends that Zachry failed to make these arguments, it is the Port’s burden to show exactly\nwhat the “releases” released, in order to prevail on its point of error. The evidence presented at trial does not support the\nPort’s claim as to what was released. To illustrate why this is so, I will address the specific releases at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           a. Release No. 23\n\nI begin by examining the release cited by the majority as an example. Release No. 23 provides as follows:\n\n            ZCC hereby acknowledges and certifies that Port of Houston Authority (PHA) has made partial\n            payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree (23) and that it has\n            no further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of\n            Costs in Payment Number Twenty-[T]hree (23).\n\nThis release was signed May 17, 2006.\n\nThe majority contends that the language “it has no further claims against PHA” is a release. See majority opinion, ante at\n855. But what exactly has been released? The agreement identifies such claims only as the claims “for the portion of the\nWork completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three (23).” In order to know\nwhat was released you must refer to the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three.\n\nIn the charge, the trial court instructed the jury, “you must decide the meaning of DX1114.012 and PX884.0159 (re Payment\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                     28\n\fPort of Houston Authority of Harris County v. Zachry Const. Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\nestimate 23)....” As the majority notes, the Payment estimate and schedule of costs were to be prepared by Zachry under the\ncontract. The referenced numbers in the jury charge refer to different copies of the same document. The documents that\nfollow these exhibit numbers differ from one another. DX1114 is a 14–page document starting with DX1114.001 and ending\nat DX1114.014. It does not include “Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree (23).” PX884 is a 307–page document,\nstarting with PX884.0001 and ending with PX884.0307. It also does not include “Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree\n(23).” It instead includes three copies of Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Two, and then jumps to Payment Estimate\nNumber Twenty–Four.\n\nThere is one document, PX884.0145, that might be Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three. Although the first page states\n“Estimate 22,” the second page states “Estimate 23.” Without knowing exactly what document is referenced in the release,\nhow could that release be unambiguous?\n\nThat Estimate contains both typed and handwritten notations. There was no testimony as to who prepared the handwritten\nnotations, or when those notations were made, or whether those notations were communicated to Zachry. The typed\ndocument has a stated date of March 25, 2006. At the bottom of the page there is a typed reference to “LIQ. DAMAGES (C +\nM)” and the number $0.00 is typed in. “C” is listed above as “Previous Liquidated Damages” with a “$0.00” notation. “M” is\nlisted as “Liquidated Damages this period” and the typed “$0.00” is crossed out and the number “820,000” has been written\nby hand. The document appears to contain the signature of Andy Thiess for the Port and the handwritten date of April 17,\n2006. At the bottom of the last page of that estimate there is a handwritten notation “-(820,000) Feb. + March LD’s.”\n\n*870 The majority puts together a letter written by the Port dated May 10, 20062 and Release No. 23 to somehow link the\nliquidated-damages deduction with the release. But, the release in question does not mention this letter at all, and the letter\nitself does not refer to Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three. The notation at the bottom can hardly be considered an\nunambiguous description of the Port’s liquidated-damages claim, especially without any testimony that this was even sent to\nZachry. Again, this can only raise an ambiguity that the jury resolved against the Port.\n\n2\n       While the majority in footnote 10 contends that other versions of the release may violate the parol evidence rule, they somehow\n       consider this letter as affirmative evidence as to what was released.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          b. Release No. 24\n\nRelease No. 24, signed June 7, 2006, suffers from some of the same problems. The jury was told to decide the meaning of\n“DX1115.017 and PX884.0168 (re Payment Estimate 24).” DX1115 does not contain Payment Estimate Number 24. PX884\nappears to contain Payment Estimate 24, but at page 884.0154. That Estimate contains both typed and handwritten notations.\nThere was no testimony as to who prepared the handwritten notations, when those notations were made, or whether those\nnotations were communicated to Zachry. The top of the typed document has a stated date of April 10, 2006. At the bottom of\nthe page there is a typed reference to “LIQ. DAMAGES (C + M)” and the number “$0.00” is typed in. The typed number has\nbeen crossed out and the number 600,0003 is handwritten above it. The “C” line above for previous liquidated damages has\nthe typed amount “$0.00,” but on the “M” line, the typed amount “$0.00” has been crossed out and replaced with the\nhandwritten figure, “820,000.” The document appears to contain the signature of Andy Thiess for the Port and the\nhandwritten date of May 10, 2006.\n\n3\n       This number does not match the majority’s chart.\n\n\n\nAll of the remaining releases suffer from the same problems. For the releases that contained handwritten notations, there was\nno testimony as to who prepared the handwritten notations, when those notations were made, or whether those notations were\ncommunicated to Zachry. Each release listed below was in the jury charge but did not have the appropriate payment estimate\nattached, and there was no testimony that the documents that I am referencing below were in fact the appropriate payment\nestimate.\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Release No. 30, dated December 15, 2006\n\nRelease No. 30 refers to Payment Estimate No. 30, which I will assume is PX884.0207. It was prepared November 20, 2006.\nIt apparently was approved by Thiess on November 30, 2006. The first page contains the typed notation “LIQ.

The “C” line contains\nthe typed figure “$0.00,” which is not crossed out, while the “M” line contains the typed number “$0.00” with a handwritten\nnumber of 155,000 inserted.\n\n\n\n\n                                           i. Release No. 31, dated January 31, 2007\n\nRelease No. 31 refers to Payment Estimate No. 31, which I will assume is PX884.0217. It was prepared December 15, 2006.\nIt apparently was approved by Thiess on January 1, 2007. The first page contains the typed notation “LIQ. DAMAGES (C +\nM) $0.00.” This is not crossed out. The “C” line above contains the typed amount “$0.00,” and it has not been crossed out.\nThe “M” line contains the typed amount “$0.00,” but that has been crossed out and the handwritten number 150,000 inserted.\n\nIt appears that every time Zachry sent its payment estimate, it listed “$0.00” in the blank for liquidated damages. On this\nrecord, we do not know whether the referenced payment estimate that was listed in the release was Zachry’s estimate—with\nzero liquidated damages—or the Port’s estimates with its handwritten notations. On this record, the Port cannot prevail as a\nmatter of law.\n\n*872 If the handwritten notations were made by Port personnel to refer to the liquidated damages in question here, then the\nPort was very inconsistent in its treatment of the liquidated damages. On some documents, the Port approved a listing of\n“$0.00” on Line “C” for “previous liquidated damages,” even though the Port had withheld previous liquidated damages.\nBecause the documents do not conclusively establish that a release occurred, I would not hold that a release occurred as a\nmatter of law.\n\nThe majority’s chart also cannot be supported by the actual releases themselves. Assuming that the handwritten notations\nindicated a liquidated-damages deduction, those handwritten numbers do not match the amounts that the majority believes\nwere the actual deductions from Zachry’s invoices.\n\nFinally, even assuming that the document included a reference to the Port’s handwritten notations, the actual release says it\nhas no further claims with respect to the Schedule of Costs in the Payment Estimate—in other words, that Zachry has no\nfurther claim that the work done cost any more than was listed in its Schedule of Costs for the work done that month. Zachry\ncannot later contend that the work cost more than listed on the Schedule. The release does not say that Zachry is to be bound\nby any summary or deductions made by the Port, or that Zachry agrees that the deductions made by the Port are correct.\nThus, the releases violate the fundamental rule that they must mention the claim to be released—it is simply missing from the\nevidence at trial. Under this evidence, we do not know what amount, if any, was allegedly released. While the majority\ncontends that the release does not have to identify the amount released, how else could the majority conclude that a release of\n$2.205 million occurred as a matter of law?\n\n\n\n3. Section 6.07 of the contract supports a release of liens only.\n\nBoth sides cite to the contract to support their claims. Section 6.07 of the contract states in pertinent part as follows:\n\n             As a condition precedent to the obligation of the Port Authority to make payment on any invoice, the\n             Contractor shall supply the Port Authority with waivers and releases of liens (including without\n             limitation all mechanics’ and materialmens’ liens and any other type of security interest), which\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                          31\n\fPort of Houston Authority of Harris County v. Zachry Const. Corp., 377 S.W.3d 841 (2012)\n\n\n\n            waivers and releases shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the Contractor and each\n            Subcontractor and Supplier expecting payment from [the] Contractor in respect of such invoice in\n            order to assure an effective release of such liens to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.\n            The waivers and releases of liens shall provide, at a minimum, that all amounts due and payable to the\n            Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier, as of the date of such invoice and as of the date\n            of the last payment received by the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier have been\n            paid in full and that the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier waives, releases and\n            relinquishes any lien (including without limitation any mechanic’s or materialman’s lien), security\n            interest and claim for payment to the extent set out the preceding sentence.\n\nI agree with Zachry’s interpretation of this section that the two sentences show an intent to release liens and not a release of a\nclaim that payment had been made in full. The second sentence limits the release to the preceding sentence which is clearly\nlimited to liens. Even the majority concedes that this section only required Zachry to release a lien. See majority opinion, ante\nat 857. But then the majority uses that against Zachry when it discusses *873 the title of the release forms, noting that\nRelease Form No. 1 was a broad release yet was titled “Partial Release of Lien.” Section 6.07 shows the parties’ intent to\nrelease liens in connection with this Release Form No. 2.\n\n\n\n4. The titles and deletions in the various forms show a limited release.\n\nThe different forms of the release show an intent by Zachry to provide a very limited release. The deletion of the broad-form\nrelease language that was present in Release Form No. 1 shows Zachry’s intent to limit its release. The fact that the Port was\nultimately unhappy with Release Form No. 2 indicates that the Port knew that this release did not provide them any\nprotection at all. See Hous. Exploration Co., 352 S.W.3d at 470–71 (deletions in a contract can be considered in its\nconstruction). While not controlling, a document’s title also can create ambiguity. See Lone Star Cement Corp., 467 S.W.2d\nat 404–05. Here, however, the titles of the documents match up with the contract provision calling only for a release of lien.\n\n\n\n5. This release violates the general rules of construction for a release.\n\nUnder general rules of contract construction, this release is, at most, ambiguous. But when the specific rules of construction\nconcerning releases are incorporated into the analysis, the release fails. To effectively release a claim in Texas, the releasing\ninstrument must mention the claim to be released. See Victoria Bank, 811 S.W.2d at 938. The releases here do not do this.\nReleases must be construed narrowly, see id., yet here, the majority expands the releases’ meaning. And unlike typical\nreleases, the releases in this case do not use language that the parties “release, discharge, [and] relinquish” their claims. Cf.\nDerr Constr. Co., 846 S.W.2d at 859 (“Release language is generally ‘release, discharge, relinquish.’ ”); MG Bldg. Materials,\nLtd. v. Moses Lopez Custom Homes, Inc., 179 S.W.3d 51, 64 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 2005, pet. denied) (same); Wallerstein\nv. Spirt, 8 S.W.3d 774, 780 (Tex.App.-Austin 1999, no pet.) (same). Despite footnote 9, the majority is unable to cite any\nmajority opinion in which the court construed a document to be a release where the document lacked such typical release\nlanguage. See also Green Int’l, 951 S.W.2d at 387 (contract language that “Contractor shall not be liable to the Subcontractor\nfor delay to Subcontractor’s work by the act, neglect or default of Owner” is not a release because it neither extinguishes a\nclaim nor establishes an absolute bar to any right of action on the released matter).\n\nFor all of these reasons I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion as to the release of the liquidated damages claim.\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

A contractor may agree to excuse the owner from liability for delay damages, even when the\nowner is at fault. The contractor thereby assumes the risk of delay from, say, an owner’s change of plans, even if the owner is\nnegligent. But can a no-damages-for-delay provision shield the owner from liability for deliberately and wrongfully\ninterfering with the contractor’s work? Before this case, a majority of American jurisdictions—including Texas courts of\nappeals, courts in all but one jurisdiction to consider the issue, and five state legislatures—had answered no. We agree with\nthis overwhelming view and also conclude that the answer is the same if the owner is a local governmental entity for which\nimmunity from suit is waived by the Local Government Contract Claims Act.1\n\n1\n       TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODEE §§ 271.151–.160.\n\n\n\nContractors are usually paid as work progresses and, in exchange for payment, must waive liens and claims related to the\nwork paid for. But does such a general waiver release a claim the contractor has already asserted? Not, we think, unless the\nclaim is specifically mentioned or the intent to do so is clear.\n\nOur conclusions require us to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals2 and remand the case to that court for further\nproceedings.\n\n2\n       377 S.W.3d 841 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   I3\n3\n       The evidence in this case was hotly disputed at almost every turn. We do not pause in this rehearsal of the proceedings to note each\n       disagreement. In reviewing any case tried to a jury, we must view the evidence “in the light most favorable to the verdict”—in this\n       case a verdict for the petitioner—“crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence\n       unless reasonable jurors could not” and so summarize the evidence in that light.

Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\n\n\nPetitioner, Zachry Construction Corporation, contracted to construct a wharf on the Bayport Ship Channel for respondent, the\nPort of Houston Authority of Harris County, Texas. The wharf would be a concrete deck supported by piers, extending out\nover the water. It would be used for loading and unloading ships carrying containerized goods and would be long\nenough—1,660 feet—for two ships to dock stern to bow. It would be built in five sections, each 135 feet wide and 332 feet\nlong. The channel was to be dredged to a *102 depth of 40 feet beneath the wharf and surrounding area, and revetment placed\nalong the shore beneath the wharf to prevent erosion. The total cost was $62,485,733.\n\nThe contract made Zachry an independent contractor in sole charge of choosing the manner in which the work would be\nconducted. Specifically, Section 5.10 of the contract provided:\n\n            The Port Authority shall not have the right to control the manner in which or prescribe the method by\n            which the Contractor [Zachry] performs the Work. As an independent Contractor, the Contractor shall\n            be solely responsible for supervision of and performance of the Work and shall prosecute the Work at\n            such time and seasons, in such order or precedence, and in such manner, using such methods as\n            Contractor shall choose....\n\nThe provision benefitted the Port, insulating it from the liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising control over\nZachry’s work.4 Still, the Port was fully engaged in reviewing Zachry’s plans and overseeing construction.\n\n4\n       See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Moritz, 257 S.W.3d 211, 214 (Tex.2008) (“Generally, an owner or occupier does not owe a duty to\n       ensure that independent contractors perform their work in a safe manner. But one who retains a right to control the contractor’s\n       work may be held liable for negligence in exercising that right.”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\nZachry’s plan was innovative. It would use soil dredged from the channel to construct an 8–foot–wide earthen berm starting\nfrom the shore at either end of the worksite, extending out toward the center of the channel, then running parallel to the shore,\nforming a long, flat U-shaped wall in the channel around the construction area. Zachry would install a refrigerated pipe\nsystem in the wall and down into the channel floor that would carry supercooled brine, freezing the wall to make it\nimpenetrable to the water in the channel. Zachry would then remove the water from the area between the wall and the shore.\nIn this way, Zachry could work “in the dry”, using bulldozers and other land equipment for the excavation and revetment\nwork. Another advantage to this freeze-wall approach was that it would lower diesel emissions and require fewer nitrous\noxide credits under environmental laws, giving the Port more flexibility in other construction projects. Zachry believed this\napproach would make the work less expensive and allow it to be completed more quickly.\n\nAnd time was of the essence to the Port. Work began in June 2004 and was to be completed in two years. But two sections of\nthe wharf had to be completed within 20 months—by February 2006—so that a ship from China could dock, delivering\ncranes to be used on the wharf. Zachry agreed to pay $20,000 per day as liquidated damages for missing the deadlines.\n\nNine months into the project, the Port realized that it would need two 1,000–foot berths to accommodate the ships it\nultimately expected to service. A sixth 332–foot section would have to be added to the wharf. As a practical matter, only\nZachry could perform the additional work, and Zachry and the Port began discussions on a change order. To complete the\ntwo sections of the wharf needed by February 2006, and to continue to work “in the dry”, Zachry proposed to build another\nfreeze-wall—a cutoff wall—though the middle of the project, perpendicular to the shoreline out to the existing wall, splitting\nthe project into two parts. Zachry would finish the west end where the ship from China would dock, remove the wall\nbarricading water from that area, then continue working on the east end “in the dry”.\n\n*103 The Port had reservations about this plan. Near the shore, the cutoff wall would have to be built through the area where\npiers had already been driven into the channel floor. The Port’s engineers were concerned that freezing the ground near the\npiers might destabilize them, weakening the wharf and making it unsafe. But the Port was also concerned that if it rejected\nZachry’s plan, Zachry might simply refuse to undertake the addition of a sixth section. So the Port did not raise its concerns\nwith Zachry. Zachry, for its part, had already identified the issue, but its own engineers had concluded that any piers that\nmight be affected could be insulated from the frozen ground. Change Order 4, using Zachry’s approach to add a sixth section\nof the wharf at a cost of $12,962,800, was finalized September 27, 2005.\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ct. J. 1378\n\n\n\nTwo weeks later, the Port ordered Zachry to revise and resubmit its plans without the cutoff wall. The practical effect of the\nPort’s order was to refuse to allow construction of the cutoff wall. Zachry protested that, under Section 5.10 of the contract,\nthe Port had no right to determine the method and manner of the work, but the Port would not budge. Zachry’s only option\nwas to finish the westmost sections in time for the ship from China to dock, then remove the wall altogether and continue to\nwork “in the wet”, which would delay completion of the project and increase its cost.\n\nIn negotiating Change Order 4, the Port had promised not to impose liquidated damages for delay as long as the ship from\nChina could dock when it arrived, though the Port had refused to put its promise in writing. Nevertheless, after the ship\nsuccessfully docked, the Port began withholding liquidated damages from Zachry’s payments. Eventually the Port desisted,\nbut not until it had withheld $2.36 million. Zachry completed the project in January 2009, more than two-and-one-half years\nafter the contract deadline.\n\nIn November 2006, several weeks after the Port refused to allow construction of the cutoff wall, Zachry sued. Zachry\neventually claimed some $30 million in damages from delays caused by the Port. The Port countered that Section 5.07 of the\ncontract precluded delay damages. That provision states:\n\n            [Zachry] shall receive no financial compensation for delay or hindrance to the Work. In no event shall\n            the Port Authority be liable to [Zachry] or any Subcontractor or Supplier, any other person or any\n            surety for or any employee or agent of any of them, for any damages arising out of or associated with\n            any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance, including\n            events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM,\n            ARISES OUT OF OR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF\n            CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY. [Zachry’s] sole remedy in any such\n            case shall be an extension of time.\n\nZachry argued, and the trial court ultimately agreed, that such a no-delay-damages provision could not be enforced if the\nPort’s intentional misconduct caused the delay.\n\nZachry also sought recovery of the $2.36 million in delay damages withheld by the Port. The trial court held that the\ncontract’s liquidated damages provisions were invalid, and the Port has not challenged that ruling on appeal. But the Port\nresponded that Zachry’s claim to the liquidated damages was precluded by the releases it executed to obtain the periodic\npayments from which liquidated damages were withheld. The releases shared language stating:\n\n            *104 [Zachry] hereby acknowledges and certifies that [the Port] has made partial payment to [Zachry]\n            on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number [–––] and that it has no further claims against [the\n            Port] for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate\n            Number [–––].5 The trial court concluded that this language did not unambiguously release Zachry’s\n            claim to the liquidated damages withheld and asked the jury to decide what effect it had.\n\n5\n       There are releases in other forms, at least one of which specifically acknowledged, and excluded any effect on, contract claims at\n       issue in pending litigation between the parties. The release for Payment Estimate Number 35 provided that the parties agreed “that\n       Zachry Construction Corporation’s execution of this Lien Release ... does not in any way release or modify the parties’ rights and\n       obligations under the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract or constitute a release of any claim or claims that the parties may\n       present in the Lawsuit with respect to Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.”\n\n\n\nAfter a three-month trial, the jury found that the Port breached the contract by rejecting Zachry’s cutoff wall design, causing\nZachry to incur $18,602,697 in delay damages.6 The jury also found that the delay “was the result of the Port’s ... arbitrary\nand capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.”7 The jury failed to find that Zachry had released its claim\nto the $2.36 million liquidated damages the Port withheld, but found that the Port was entitled to offset $970,000 for\ndefective wharf fenders. The trial court rendered judgment for Zachry on the verdict.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\n6\n       The jury was asked to find damages for “[t]he balance due and owed by the Port, if any, under the Contract, including any amount\n       owed as compensation for any increased cost to perform the work as a direct result of Port-caused delays, and ... [t]he amount\n       owed, if any, for additional work that Zachry was directed to perform by the Port in connection with the Contract.” The jury found\n       that the percentage of damages for hindrance or delay, as opposed to additional work, was 58.13%. The Port and Zachry have since\n       stipulated that 100% of the damages found by the jury were for hindrance or delay.\n\n\n\n7\n       In assessing damages, the jury was instructed as follows:\n            You are instructed that § 5.07 of the Contract precludes Zachry from recovering delay or hindrance damages, if any, unless\n            you find that the delay or hindrance damages, if any, resulted from a delay or hindrance that was the result of the Port’s\n            actions, if any, that constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.\n            “Arbitrary and capricious” means willful and unreasoning action without due consideration and in disregard of the facts,\n            circumstances, and rights of other parties involved.\n            “Active interference” means affirmative, willful action that unreasonably interferes with the other party’s compliance with the\n            contract. “Active interference” requires more than a simple mistake, error in judgment, lack of total effort, or lack of complete\n            diligence.\n            “Bad faith” is conscious doing of a wrong for a dishonest purpose.\n            “Fraud” occurs when\n               1. a party makes a material misrepresentation,\n               2. the misrepresentation is made with knowledge of its falsity or made recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as\n               a positive assertion,\n               3. the misrepresentation is made with the intention that it should be acted on by the other party, and\n               4. the other party suffers injury as a result of its reliance on the misrepresentation.\n            “Misrepresentation” means a promise of future performance made with an intent, at the time the promise was made, not to\n            perform as promised, and the promise of future performance is that the Port would comply with the terms of Change Order 4.\n\n\n\nBoth the Port and Zachry appealed. The court of appeals held that the no- *105 delay-damages provision of the contract\nbarred Zachry’s recovery of delay damages,8 that Zachry unambiguously released its claims to $2.205 million of the\nliquidated damages withheld,9 and that the Port was entitled to the $970,000 found by the jury for defective wharf fenders.10\nThe court reversed the judgment for Zachry and rendered judgment for the Port, awarding it the $10,697,750 in attorney fees\nfound by the jury.11\n\n8\n       377 S.W.3d 841, 850–851 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012).\n\n\n\n9\n       Id. at 857–858. The court was divided on this issue.\n\n\n\n10\n       Id. at 861. Since the $155,000 in liquidated damages to which Zachry had not released its claim was completely offset by the\n       $970,000 for the defective fenders, Zachry recovered nothing.\n\n\n\n11\n       Id. at 865. Section 3.10 of the contracts states: “If [Zachry] brings any claim against the Port Authority and [Zachry] does not\n       prevail with respect to such claim, [Zachry] shall be liable for all attorneys’ fees incurred by the Port Authority as a result of such\n       claim.”\n\n\n\nWe granted Zachry’s petition for review.12\n\n12\n       56 Tex.

The Port disagrees but also\nargues that even if the provision has no effect, the contract is otherwise silent on the recovery of delay damages, and the\nLocal Government Contract Claims Act (“the Act”)13 does not waive governmental immunity from suit for any recovery a\ncontract does not itself provide for. The court of appeals concluded that the no-damages-for-delay provision is enforceable\nand thus found it unnecessary to reach the immunity issue.14 That approach was impermissible. Immunity “implicates a\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction over pending claims”,15 and “ ‘[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any\ncause; it may not assume jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits of the case.’ ”16 We must consider first whether\nthe Act waives a local governmental entity’s immunity from suit on a contract claim for delay damages the contract does not\ncall for.\n\n13\n          Tex. Loc. Gov’t Code §§ 271.151–.160.\n\n\n\n14\n          377 S.W.3d at 865 n. 25. The Port asserted governmental immunity in the trial court but did not request a ruling.\n\n\n\n15\n          Rusk State Hosp. v. Black, 392 S.W.3d 88, 95 (Tex.2012).\n\n\n\n16\n          Fin.

One is whether the Act’s limitations on recovery help define and restrict the scope of the waiver of\nimmunity. If not, those limitations have no role in determining a court’s jurisdiction over a claim.17 If so, as we conclude, the\nsecond part of the immunity issue is whether the delay damages Zachry seeks are permitted by the Act, so that the *106\nPort’s immunity from suit is waived. We conclude they are.\n\n17\n          The effect of the Act’s limitations on recovery is important, though not in this case, in responding to a governmental entity’s plea\n          to the jurisdiction, the ruling on which is subject to interlocutory appeal. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 51.014(a)(8).

The Port—known until 1971 as the Harris County Houston Ship Channel\n          Navigation District—is a navigation district created in 1927 under the authority of article XVI, section 59 of the Texas\n          Constitution, with the authority to sue and be sued. Guillory v. Port of Houston Auth., 845 S.W.2d 812, 812–813 (Tex.1993); see\n          also Jones v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 397 S.W.2d 304, 306–307 (Tex.Civ.App.-Houston 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (concluding in part\n          that the Houston Ship Channel’s immunity from tort liability was not waived by a “sue and be sued” clause). In 1970, the Court\n          held that the same “sue and be sued” clause waived a navigation district’s governmental immunity from suit. Mo. Pac. R.R.

The Port would then have been subject to suit, and possible contract\n          liability, until the Missouri Pacific decision was overruled in Tooke v.

As a\nrule, a modifier like the last “subject to” phrase in Section 271.152 applies to the nearest reasonable referent.28 The candidates\nare “contract”, “claim”, “adjudicating”, and “waives”. We do not think the phrase modifies “contract”. Earlier in the\nsentence, the Act is made applicable to any “contract subject to this subchapter”, and it would be needlessly redundant to\nreiterate a few words later that the contract is subject to the Act’s terms and conditions.29 Nor do we think the phrase modifies\n“claim”. Section 271.158,30 for example, provides only that the Act does not grant immunity and says nothing about the\nnature of the claim for which immunity is waived. And we do not think the “subject to” phrase modifies “adjudicating”. If it\ndid, only the adjudicatory process would be governed by the Act’s terms and conditions. This reading might make sense for\nthe recovery limits and preservation of procedures and defenses provided in Sections 271.153,31 271.154,32 and Section\n271.155,33 respectively. Those three sections relate to the litigation and adjudication *108 of a claim. But the other four\nsections, limiting the Act’s coverage to suits in state court on contract claims, providing that immunity is not granted, and\nprecluding a finding of joint enterprise, have little, if anything, to do with the adjudication on claims. These\nsections—271.156,34 271.157,35 271.158,36 and 271.160,37 respectively—relate to the scope of immunity rather than the\nconduct of litigation.\n\n28\n       See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A.

The waiver does not extend to tort suits, suits in federal court, or allow recovery beyond that\npermitted by Section 271.153. But Section 271.152, as qualified by this “subject to” phrase also does not preclude other\ndefenses or other contractual procedures, or confer immunity or suggest joint enterprise. The “subject to” phrase most\nreasonably refers to “waives”, thus making the provisions of the Act limitations on the waiver of immunity. Section 271.152\nmust be read as follows: “A local governmental entity ... waives sovereign immunity to suit ... subject to the terms and\nconditions” of the Act.\n\nWe reached this result in Tooke v. City of Mexia38 without the analysis just laid out because it seemed obvious. The Tookes\nsued the City of Mexia for breach of contract, “asserting that they had relied on a three-year term in purchasing equipment.\nThey claimed unspecified damages, but requested jury findings only on lost profits and attorney fees”.39 They did not claim\nthat the City failed to pay for work actually performed; rather, they sought recovery only for lost profits they would have\nmade had the contract continued—“consequential damages excluded from recovery under [Section 271.153].”40 Even though\nthe Tookes’ contract claim fell within Section 271.152,41 we concluded—because they did not “claim damages within\n[Section 271.153’s] limitations”—that “the City’s immunity from suit on the Tookes’ claim has not been waived.”42 This was\ntrue even though the Tookes might have proved that the City breached the contract.\n\n38\n       197 S.W.3d 325 (Tex.2006).\n\n\n\n39\n       Id. at 330.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Clear Lake City Water Authority43 to retreat from Tooke. There, developers sued\nan area water authority for reimbursement of part of their costs of building water and sewer facilities, which the authority had\nagreed to pay out of voter-approved bond funds.44 No bonds had been approved, but the developers claimed that the water\nauthority had breached the contract by campaigning against approval, thereby forestalling its reimbursement obligation.45 The\nwater authority argued in *109 part that because no bonds had been approved, its obligation to reimburse the developers had\nnot been triggered, nothing was “due and owed” under Section 271.153(a)(1), and for that reason, immunity was not\nwaived.46 In other words, because there was no liability, there were no recoverable damages and, therefore, no waiver of\nimmunity. But the premise—no liability—was disputed, and if the water authority had breached the contract by opposing\nbond approval, then the developers claimed only the reimbursement under the contract as damages. And such damages, we\nheld, were “due and owed” under Section 271.153(a)(1).47 “The purpose of section 271.153,” we explained, “is to limit the\namount due by a governmental agency on a contract once liability has been established, not to foreclose the determination of\nwhether liability exists.”48 We did not suggest that Section 271.153 permits a waiver of immunity from suit for a claim for\ndamages this Section prohibits altogether. The developers argued that they had damages recoverable under Section 273.153;49\nthey did not address, and we did not consider, whether immunity would have been waived for their claim of breach even if\nthey sought only damages not recoverable under Section 271.153. We would not have engaged in such an analysis without\nacknowledging the conflict with our opinion in Tooke.50\n\n43\n       320 S.W.3d 829 (Tex.2010).\n\n\n\n44\n       Id. at 833–834.\n\n\n\n45\n       Id. at 834 (re 2006 bond election); see also Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v.

City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d 407, 412–413 (Tex.2011), Sharyland contracted to build a\n          water-supply system for the City of Alton. Sharyland sued the City for breach, claiming damages for injury to its system caused by\n          contractors engaged by the City under another contract to build a sanitary sewer system. We concluded that while the claim was\n          covered by Section 271.152 and was therefore one for which immunity was waived, the damages sought had nothing to do with the\n          contract between Sharyland and the City and thus were “not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract” recoverable under\n          Section 271.153. Id. at 413. As in Kirby Lake, however, the issue whether Section 271.153 is jurisdictional did not arise, and we\n          did not consider it.\n\n\n\n      The Austin Court of Appeals has laid out the case for confining the scope of the Act’s waiver to Section 271.152 in its\n[5] [6]\n\nopinion in City of San Antonio v. Lower Colorado River Authority.51 LCRA reasons that immunity from suit and immunity\nfrom liability are distinct concepts, that the former may be waived for a claim on which a governmental entity is not liable,\nand that the Act serves this very purpose.52 We agree with all but the conclusion. As we have explained, Section 271.153’s\nlimitations on recovery are incorporated into Section 271.152 by its last “subject to” clause and are thereby conditions on the\nAct’s waiver of immunity. We disagree with LCRA that this reading of the Act makes its waiver of immunity dependent on\nultimate liability. The Act waives immunity for contract claims that meet certain conditions: the existence of a specific type\nof contract, a demand for certain kinds of damages, a state forum, etc. The waiver does not depend on the outcome, though it\ndoes require a showing of a substantial claim that meets the Act’s conditions. LCRA argues that this view of the Act makes\nSection 271.153 a grant of immunity, a construction precluded by *110 Section 271.158. But again, Section 271.153 does not\nadd immunity that Section 271.152 takes away; Section 271.152 uses Section 271.153 to further define to what extent\nimmunity has been waived.\n\n51\n          369 S.W.3d 231 (Tex.App.-Austin 2011, no pet.).\n\n\n\n52\n          369 S.W.3d at 235–238.\n\n\n[7]\n   By “substantial” claim we mean, as we held in Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda, that the claimant must\nplead facts with some evidentiary support that constitute a claim for which immunity is waived, not that the claimant will\nprevail.53 In Tooke, the only damages claimed were precluded by Section 271.153, and therefore immunity was not waived.\nHad the Tookes claimed payment for work done, immunity would have been waived, regardless of whether the Tookes could\nprevail, as long as the Tookes had some supporting evidence.\n\n53\n          133 S.W.3d 217, 226–228 (Tex.2004) (“When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the pleadings, we determine if the pleader has\n          alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court’s jurisdiction to hear the cause. We construe the pleadings liberally in favor\n          of the plaintiffs and look to the pleaders’ intent. If ... the issue is one of pleading sufficiency [ ] the plaintiffs should be afforded the\n          opportunity to amend [unless] the pleadings affirmatively negate the existence of jurisdiction.... However, if a plea to the\n          jurisdiction challenges the existence of jurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary\n          to resolve the jurisdictional issues raised.... If the evidence creates a fact question ... the trial court cannot grant the plea to the\n          jurisdiction, and the fact issue will be resolved by the fact finder.” (citations omitted)).\n\n\n\nWe conclude that the Act does not waive immunity from suit on a claim for damages not recoverable under Section\n271.153.54\n\n54\n          We disapprove the following cases to the extent they are to the contrary: Santa Rosa Indep.

Port of Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\n\n\n65\n       The dissent argues that because an amount cannot be “due and owed” unless it is “provided for or contemplated in” the contract,\n       delay damages, which are expressly included in Section 271.153(a)(1), must also be “provided for or contemplated in” the contract.\n       Post at 113. If the premise were true, then the conclusion would follow. “A including B” usually means that A is the larger group.\n       But the dissent’s “provided for or contemplated in” limitation simply is not in or suggested by the text. The “including” phrase\n       proves the flaw in the dissent’s position: “any amount as compensation for ... delay damages” (emphasis added), which amount\n       may or may not be provided for in the contract, cannot be included in “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” if that\n       phrase is limited to amounts provided for in the contract. Of course, “any Texas city, including Athens”, to use the dissent’s\n       example, is limited to one, but the example, like the dissent’s statutory construction, assumes a limitation to Texas cities when that\n       is the very issue in dispute. A more apt example is “a city, including any named Athens”, which is a longer list.\n\n\n[9]\n   Furthermore, Section 271.153(b) excludes from the “[d]amages awarded ... under a contract” consequential damages\nexcept as allowed in Subsection (a)(1). If the latter provision limited recovery to amounts stated in the contract, Subsection\n(b) would be surplusage: a claimant could recover all amounts stated in the contract, and all consequential damages stated in\nthe contract. Read together, Subsections (a)(1) and (b) allow recovery of contract damages, including delay damages, but\nexcluding other consequential damages. Nothing in the rest of Section 271.153 suggests that recoverable damages must be\nstated in the contract.66\n\n66\n       The dissent argues that damages “under” a contract are only those “provided for or contemplated in” the contract, but “under the\n       contract” is used to refer generally to damages available on a contract claim. See, e.g., CVN Group, Inc. v. Delgado, 95 S.W.3d\n       234, 244 (Tex.2002) (referring to “liability for money damages under the contract”); Great Am. Ins. Co. v. N. Austin Mun. Util.\n       Dist. No. 1, 950 S.W.2d 371, 373 (Tex.1997) (referring to the need for “extrinsic evidence ... to calculate damages under the\n       contract”). Further, parties entering into a contract presumably contemplate that contract damages will be available if that contract\n       is breached. See City of Houston v. Williams, 353 S.W.3d 128, 141 (2011) (“[I]t is ‘settled that the laws which subsist at the time\n       and place of the making of a contract ... form a part of it, as if they were expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.’ ”) (suit\n       by retired firefighters based in part on city ordinances could be characterized as one for breach of contract under Section 271.152);\n       Wessely Energy Corp. v. Jennings, 736 S.W.2d 624, 626 (Tex.1987) (“The law[ ] existing at the time a contract is made becomes a\n       part of the contract and governs the transaction.”); Kerr v. Galloway, 94 Tex. 641, 64 S.W. 858, 860 (1901) (“Under a familiar\n       rule, frequently announced, the law enters into the contract, and becomes a part of it.”); see also Hardware Dealers Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n       Berglund, 393 S.W.2d 309, 315 (Tex.1965) (“Contracting parties generally select a judicially construed clause with the intention of\n       adopting the meaning which the courts have given to it.”). The dissent argues that limiting recovery to contractual damages is no\n       limit at all, but damages are but one item in a list that includes attorney fees and interest, even if not provided for in the contract.\n       The dissent argues that allowing recovery of contractual damages under Section 271.153(a)(1) renders subsection (2) superfluous,\n       but the latter provision clarifies that change orders can be the basis for recovery, even if it were argued that they were not “under\n       the contract”.\n\n\n\n*113 In support of its argument, the Port cites two sentences from the remarks made by the bill sponsor introducing the Local\nGovernment Contract Claims Act during a House committee hearing. But we have repeatedly held that “[s]tatements made\nduring the legislative process by individual legislators or even a unanimous legislative chamber are not evidence of the\ncollective intent of the majorities of both legislative chambers that enacted a statute.”67 The Port also cites our opinion in\nKirby Lake, where we stated that the reimbursement obligation stated in the contract was “due and owed”.68 But we did not\nanalyze the phrase, and we certainly did not suggest that damages not set out in the contract cannot be “due and owed”.69\n\n67\n       Molinet v.

City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d 407 (Tex.2011), for its argument that\n       recoverable damages must be “provided for or contemplated in” the contract. In that case a city contracted for construction of a\n       water supply system, and later the contractor sued for the cost of remediating injury to the system caused by the city’s sewer\n       contractors. Id. at 410–411. We concluded that the damages sought “were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water\n       Supply Agreement and [were] not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract. Nor [were] these costs the ‘direct result of\n       owner-caused delays or acceleration....’ ” Id. at 413. The dissent argues that the phrase, “provided for or contemplated in”, was\n       really intended to be a standard for determining whether an amount is “due and owed ... under” a contract. But the Court clearly\n       gave two independent reasons for concluding that the claimed damages were not recoverable: they were not “provided for or\n       contemplated in” the contract, “and” they were not “due and owed under” the contract. Sharyland’s claimed damages were not a\n       “balance due and owed” because they were completely unrelated to the Water Supply Agreement. And by adding, “nor” were the\n       damages for delay, referencing the “including” phrase in Section 157.053(a)(1), we suggested that if the damages had been for\n       delay, they would have been recoverable even if neither “due and owed under” nor “provided for or contemplated in” the contract.\n       We treated the “including” phrase in the statutory provision as stating independently that delay damages are recoverable. Instead of\n       supporting the dissent, Sharyland contradicts it.\n\n\n\n*114 [10] [11] [12] More than half a century ago, we observed that “[t]he universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of\na contract is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.”70 While the Legislature clearly intended to limit the\nrecovery of consequential damages on contract claims permitted by the Act,71 nothing in the Act suggests that the Legislature\nintended to create a unique and somehow limited standard for measuring direct damages for breach of contract. Generally, a\ncontractor has a right to delay damages for breach of contract. The parties are free to modify or exclude it by agreement, but\nunless they do, the right provided by law is as much a part of the contract as the rights the contract expressly creates.72\n\n70\n       Stewart v. Basey, 150 Tex. 666, 245 S.W.2d 484, 486 (1952).\n\n\n\n71\n       “Consequential damages are those damages that result naturally, but not necessarily, from the defendant’s wrongful acts.” Basic\n       Capital Mgmt. v. Dynex Commercial, Inc., 348 S.W.3d 894, 901 (Tex.2011); El Paso Mktg., L.P. v. Wolf Hollow I, L.P., 383\n       S.W.3d 138, 144 (Tex.2012). Delay damages are consequential damages.\n\n\n\n72\n       See supra note 66.\n\n\n\nWe conclude that the Local Government Contract Claims Act waives immunity for a contract claim for delay damages not\nexpressly provided for in the contract.73 We now turn to whether Zachry’s claim is barred by the no-damages-for-delay\nprovision of the contract.\n\n73\n       The dissent notes that the State Agency Contract Claims Act, enacted in 2013, contains a provision similar to Section\n       271.153(a)(1) except that the “including” phrase permits recovery of delay damages only “if the contract expressly provides for\n       that compensation”. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § 114.004(a)(1) (Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1260, H.B.\n       586, § 1, http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/83 R/billtext/pdf/HB00586F.pdf# navpanes= 0 (last visited August 25, 2014)). The\n       dissent argues that the proviso states what is implicit in Section 271.153(a)(1). But if anything, the addition of the proviso suggests\n       that it was not intended in the other three statutes waiving immunity from suit on contract claims.\n          It should also be noted that the State Contract Claims Act was amended in 2005 (Act of May 27, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 988,\n          H.B.1940, § 1, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 3292), the same year the Local Government Contract Claims Act was adopted (Act of May\n          23, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 604, H.B.2039, § 1, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 1548), to provide for recovery of delay damages, but did\n          so using the word “and” instead of “including”. Supra note 59. Using the dissent’s argument, one might contend that both\n          statutes intended that delay damages be recoverable whether or not provided for by contract.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In support of Zachry’s petition for review, we\n          received amicus briefs and letters from the Texas Aggregates and Concrete Association; the Texas Civil Justice League;\n          Associated General Contractors of Texas; Texans for Lawsuit Reform; Zurich Surety; Associated Builders and Contractors of\n          Texas; Associated General Contractors—Texas Building Branch; the National Electrical Contractors Association; the National\n          Systems Contractors Association; and the American Subcontractors Association and the American Subcontractors Association of\n          Texas. Amicus briefs in support of the Port have been submitted by The Texas Conference of Urban Counties; the City of Houston;\n          the Texas Municipal League and the Texas City Attorneys Association; Harris County; Travis County; the City of Fort Worth; the\n          City of Arlington; the City of Dallas; and the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport Board.\n\n\n\nRegardless, the purpose of the second Ball exception is to preclude a party from insulating himself from liability for his own\ndeliberate, wrongful conduct.\n[14]\n    We have indicated that pre-injury waivers of future liability for gross negligence are void as against public policy.86\nGenerally, a contractual provision “exempting a party from tort liability for harm caused intentionally or recklessly is\nunenforceable on grounds of public policy.”87 We think the same may be said of contract liability. To conclude otherwise\nwould incentivize wrongful conduct and damage contractual relations. This conclusion is supported by lower court decisions\nin Texas88 and court decisions in at least 28 American jurisdictions.89 We join this overwhelming consensus. The Port *117\nargues that the cases from other jurisdictions are inapposite because those jurisdictions all recognize a party’s duty of good\nfaith in performing a contract, and Texas does not.90 But the law need not impose a duty of good faith on a party to prohibit\nhim from attempting to escape liability for his future, deliberate, wrongful conduct. The Port argues that withholding\n\n                   © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                21\n\fZachry Const. Corp. v. Port of Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\nenforcement of a no-damages-for-delay provision is in derogation of freedom of contract. But that freedom has limits. “As a\nrule, parties have the right to contract as they see fit as long as their agreement does not violate the law or public policy.”91\nEnforcing such a provision to allow one party to intentionally injure another with impunity violates the law for the reasons\nwe *118 have explained. The Port also argues that Zachry is a sophisticated party, a very large construction company that can\nprotect itself. But the law’s protection against intentional injury is not limited to the helpless. Finally, the Port argues that the\nconduct found by the jury does not qualify for the exception. But the jury charge tracked the language of the second and fifth\nexceptions. The charge correctly described the misconduct that cannot be covered by a no-damages-for-delay provision.\n\n86\n       Fairfield Ins. Co. v.

For each progress payment, Zachry executed a document entitled “Affidavit and Partial\nRelease of Lien”, which contained the following language:\n\n            [Zachry] hereby acknowledges and certifies that [the Port Authority] has made partial payment to\n            [Zachry] on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number [–––] and that it has no further claims\n            against [the Port Authority] for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs\n            in Payment Estimate Number [–––].\n\nZachry contends that the releases covered only liens. The Port counters that the releases covered all claims for payment. The\ntrial court concluded that the release language was ambiguous on the issue and charged the jury to determine its effect. The\njury failed to find that the release language covered Zachry’s claims for liquidated damages withheld by the Port. The court\nof appeals held that the releases unambiguously covered Zachry’s claim for liquidated damages and reversed.92 We agree that\nthe releases are unambiguous, but we conclude that they do not cover Zachry’s claim.\n\n92\n       377 S.W.3d 841.\n\n\n\nSection 6.07 of the contract conditioned the Port’s obligation to make progress payments on Zachry’s execution of “waivers\nand releases of liens” providing “that all amounts due and payable” to Zachry and all subcontractors and suppliers “have been\npaid in full” and that Zachry “waives, releases and relinquishes any lien ..., security interest and claim for payment”. The Port\nargues that the releases must be construed in light of this requirement because the contract and releases are related contracts\nand must be read together.93 While Section 6.07 could be read to require Zachry to release its claims for liquidated damages\nwithheld by the Port in order to obtain progress payments, that is not the issue. Had the Port insisted on express language to\nthat effect, and had Zachry refused, the interpretation of Section 6.07 would be important. Now, however, the issue is not\nwhat releases Zachry was contractually required to execute, but the effect of the releases Zachry actually did execute.\n\n93\n       City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 811 (Tex.2005).\n\n\n\nThe release forms were captioned “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien”. In the form language, Zachry acknowledged\n“partial payment ... on all sums owing” on a specified invoice and stated that it had “no further claims against [the Port] for\nthe portion of the Work completed and listed on” the invoice. The release plainly refers only to claims for work completed,\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Port of Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\nnot for *119 liquidated damages withheld for delays—work not completed. Furthermore, Zachry actively disputed the Port’s\nright to withhold liquidated damages from the first time the Port did so, and that dispute was never resolved. The purpose of\nprogress payment releases is to ensure that the contractor will not accept payment for work performed and then insist on\nadditional payment for that work. Zachry’s releases can no more be interpreted to extend to its claim for liquidated damages\nthe Port withheld than to its claim for delay damages. The jury failed to find that the releases in fact covered Zachry’s claim.\nWe agree, as a matter of law.\n\nSecond: The trial court did not award Zachry the entirety of the $2.36 million in withheld payments because the jury found\nthat the Port was entitled to an offset of $970,000 as damages for Zachry’s use of defective wharf fenders. Zachry contends\nthat the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s finding.\n\nTo prove its claim for the offset, the Port submitted evidence that the wharf fenders, which protect vessels from damage\nduring the mooring process, were supposed to last for 30 years but became corroded after only 90 days. The Port’s expert\nwitness testified that this occurred because the fenders were improperly sealed and, as a result, “the aluminum pores [ ]\nremain[ed] open [and] filled with sea water.” A lab analysis and tests that a structural fabrication company conducted\nsupported the expert’s conclusion. Zachry contends that the evidence does not establish that it breached the contract because\nthe sealing or coating on the fenders was “thinned” at 25% in accordance with the contract specifications, and if more\nthinning was required then the blame lies with the specifications and not with Zachry. Even if there were a breach of contract,\nZachry argues that the evidence does not establish that the fenders were in fact defective or that the breach caused the\ndamages that the jury awarded.\n[16]\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we cannot agree that the evidence was legally insufficient\nto support the jury’s verdict. Although Zachry submitted evidence that tended to contradict the Port’s evidence, we conclude\nthat there was “more than a mere scintilla” of evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that Zachry breached its\nobligation to provide fenders that were supposed to last 30 years by providing fenders that began corroding within 90 days,\nand that the Port sustained damages in the amount of $970,000 as a result, entitling it to an offset against the damages\nrecovered by Zachry.\n\nThird: The contract provided that “[i]f [Zachry] brings any claim against the Port Authority and [Zachry] does not prevail\nwith respect to such claim, [Zachry] shall be liable for all attorney’s fees incurred by the Port Authority as a result of such\nclaim.” The jury found that the Port incurred $10.5 million in attorney fees as a result of Zachry’s claim for delay damages,\nplus additional fees on appeal. Separately, the jury found that the Port incurred $80,250 in attorney fees as a result of\nZachry’s claim to recover the payments that the Port withheld as liquidated damages, plus additional fees on appeal. In light\nof our holdings that Zachry prevails on both its claims for delay damages and to recover part of the withheld payments, we\nreverse the court of appeals’ judgment awarding the Port attorney fees.\n\n******\n\nWe hold that Zachry’s claim for delay damages is not barred by immunity or by the no-damages-for-delay provision of the\ncontract. We also hold that Zachry is entitled to recover the liquidated damages *120 withheld by the Port, but that there is\nevidence to support the jury’s award of an offset. We conclude that the court of appeals erred in awarding the Port attorney\nfees. We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment, and because the Port has raised a number of other issues, we remand the\ncase to that court for further consideration.\n\n\n\n\nJustice BOYD filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice JOHNSON, Justice WILLETT, and Justice LEHRMANN joined.\n\nJustice BOYD, joined by Justice JOHNSON, Justice WILLETT, and Justice LEHRMANN, dissenting in part.\n\nChapter 271 of the Texas Local Government Code waives a local governmental entity’s immunity against suits for breach of\nwritten contracts for goods and services, but it does so only to allow contractors to recover “the balance due and owed by the\nlocal governmental entity under the contract.” TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1) (emphases added). The Court\nholds that this waiver allows Zachry Construction Corporation to recover common law delay damages that are not part of\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

J. 1378\n\n“the balance due and owed ... under the contract” it entered into with the Port Authority of Houston. In fact, in this contract,\nZachry expressly agreed that the Port Authority would never owe damages for costs that Zachry incurred due to any delay or\nhindrance. The Court invalidates this no-damages-for-delay clause for public policy reasons. But even after striking that\nclause, the contract does not provide for or in any way contemplate that the Port Authority would pay for Zachry’s delay\ncosts. Because delay costs are not part of “the balance due and owed by [the Port Authority] under [this] contract,” I would\nhold that Chapter 271 does not waive the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim for delay damages, and I would\ndismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction. Because governmental immunity bars Zachry’s claim for delay damages, I would\nnot reach the issue of whether the no-damages-for-delay clause is void for public policy reasons. I therefore respectfully\ndissent in part.1\n\n1\n       For the reasons the Court explains, I agree with its holding in Part II(A) that section 271.153’s limitation on recoverable damages\n       is jurisdictional because chapter 271 “does not waive immunity from suit on a claim for damages not recoverable under Section\n       271.153.” Ante at 110. I would not reach the public policy issue in Part III of the Court’s opinion. In Part IV of its opinion, the\n       Court holds that Zachry can recover on its separate claim for $2.36 million that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated damages,\n       less a $970,000 offset for damages resulting from Zachry’s use of defective wharf fenders. Ante at 119. I agree with this portion of\n       the Court’s opinion, for the reasons the Court has explained. The funds that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated damages\n       were part of the monthly progress payments that the Port Authority agreed to make for Zachry’s services and were part of “the\n       balance due and owed ... under the contract.” Section 271.153 thus waives the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim to\n       recover those funds, and the courts have jurisdiction to resolve that claim. The mere fact that the Port Authority denies liability on\n       the claim does not negate the statute’s waiver of immunity from suit for damages that are provided for or clearly contemplated\n       under the contract. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE §§ 271.152–.153.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    I.\n\n\n\n                                      Governmental Immunity Against Contract Actions\n\nAs a local governmental entity, the Port Authority “enjoy[s] governmental immunity from suit, unless immunity is expressly\nwaived.” Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v. Clear Lake City Water Auth., 320 S.W.3d 829, 836 (Tex.2010). Governmental immunity\n*121 includes both immunity from liability, “which bars enforcement of a judgment against a governmental entity, and\nimmunity from suit, which bars suit against the entity altogether.” Tooke v. City of Mexia, 197 S.W.3d 325, 332 (Tex.2006).\nA governmental entity that enters into a contract “necessarily waives immunity from liability, voluntarily binding itself like\nany other party to the terms of agreement, but it does not waive immunity from suit.” Id. Unlike immunity from liability,\nimmunity from suit deprives the courts of jurisdiction and thus completely bars the plaintiff’s claim. Wichita Falls State\nHosp. v. Taylor, 106 S.W.3d 692, 696 (Tex.2003).\n\nWhile most damages awards justly impose the financial consequences of a party’s wrongdoing on the wrongdoer, a damages\naward against a governmental entity imposes the financial consequences on innocent third parties: taxpayers. Thus, although\n“[t]he doctrine of governmental immunity arose hundreds of years ago from the idea that ‘the king can do no wrong,’ ... it\nremains a fundamental principle of Texas law, intended ‘to shield the public from the costs and consequences of improvident\nactions of their governments.’ ” Lubbock Cnty. Water Control & Improvement Dist. v. Church & Akin, L.L.C., 442 S.W.3d\n297, 300 (Tex.2014) (quoting Tooke, 197 S.W.3d at 331–32). In some circumstances, however, justice may demand that the\ngovernment compensate innocent injured parties even though innocent taxpayers must pay the bill. The challenge is in\ndeciding which circumstances justify a waiver of immunity to allow for such compensation.\n\nBecause this decision “requires balancing numerous policy considerations, we have consistently deferred to the Legislature,\nas the public’s elected representative body, to decide whether and when to waive the government’s immunity.” Lubbock\nCnty., 442 S.W.3d at 301. The Legislature may waive the government’s immunity, and thereby “consent to suit[,] by statute\nor by legislative resolution.” Fed. Sign v. Tex. S. Univ., 951 S.W.2d 401, 405 (Tex.1997). The Legislature has declared that\nwe cannot construe a statute to waive immunity “unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.” TEX.\nGOV’T CODE § 311.034; see also Tooke, 197 S.W.3d at 328–29 (agreeing that statutory waiver of immunity must be “by\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

If a statute seeks to waive immunity, it “must do so beyond doubt.” Wichita Falls State\nHosp., 106 S.W.3d at 697.\n\nFor the first 154 years of Texas’ existence, parties who contracted with the government could not recover for the\ngovernment’s breach unless they first convinced the Legislature to pass a special resolution waiving immunity for their\nspecific claim. See Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 408 (reaffirming previous holdings that “the State is immune from suit arising\nfrom breach of contract suits”); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 107.001–.005 (governing resolutions granting\npermission to sue the State). Not surprisingly, this often made it difficult for governmental entities to find qualified\ncontractors who were willing to provide goods and services. In 1999, the Legislature enacted Chapter 2260 of the Texas\nGovernment Code, providing an administrative procedure through which parties to certain contracts with a State agency or\ndepartment could recover damages for the agency’s breach. See TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 2260.001–.108. Chapter 2260 did\nnot waive the State’s immunity, id. § 2260.006, but instead provided an alternative administrative process through which the\ncontractor could seek relief. See id. The statute provides this option only for parties to certain kinds of contracts, and it limits\nthe administrative award to $250,000 unless the Legislature *122 separately authorizes a higher award in a specific case. See\nid. § 2260.105.2\n\n2\n       Under chapter 2260, an administrative law judge can only award up to $250,000 for a valid breach of contract claim. See TEX.\n       GOV’T CODE § 2260.105. Valid claims above $250,000 are referred to the Legislature to decide, in light of appropriate policy\n       considerations, whether to authorize additional funds for payment of the claim. See id. § 2260.1055; Gen. Servs. Comm’n v.\n       Little–Tex Insulation Co., Inc., 39 S.W.3d 591, 596 (Tex.2001).\n\n\n\nAlthough Chapter 2260 provides a limited avenue of relief for those who contract with State agencies and departments,3 it\nprovides no remedy at all for those who contract with a local governmental entity. The Legislature first addressed local\ngovernmental entities in 2003, when it enacted a limited waiver of immunity for certain breach of contract suits against Texas\ncounties. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 262.007. Then, in 2005, the Legislature enacted the provisions of Chapter 271\nthat are at issue in this case, providing the same limited waiver for certain breach of contract suits against all other types of\nlocal governmental entities. See id. §§ 271.151–.160. Most recently, in 2013, the Legislature enacted Chapter 114 of the\nTexas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, providing the same limited waiver of immunity from suits for certain contract claims\nagainst State agencies. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 114.001–.013.\n\n3\n       See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2260.001(4) (defining “unit of state government”).\n\n\n\nAs it had done in Chapter 2260, the Legislature strictly limited the immunity waivers in Chapters 262, 271, and 114, not only\nin terms of the types of contracts under which a party can sue, but also in terms of the types and amounts of damages the\nparty can recover. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE §§ 262.007(b), (c), 271.153; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §\n114.004. Thus, the Legislature has only recently acted to waive immunity for contract claims, and each time it has done so, it\nhas strictly limited the scope of that waiver. Respectful of the Legislature’s prerogative to decide whether, when, and how to\nwaive the State’s immunity, and mindful of our obligation to find waivers only in “clear and unambiguous language” that\nleaves “no doubt,” we must carefully and strictly construe and apply these statutory limitations. I dissent in this case because\nthe Court’s holding that Zachry’s delay damages are recoverable under section 271.153 ignores the statute’s limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                II.\n\n\n\n                                                         Section 271.153\n\nSection 271.153 is entitled “LIMITATIONS ON ADJUDICATION AWARDS.” Id. § 271.153 (emphasis added).4 Consistent\n*123 with its title, subsection (a) of section 271.153 identifies three exclusive categories of damages that a contractor can\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While I agree that delay damages can\nbe part of “the balance due and owed by [a] local governmental entity under [some ] contract[s],” I do not agree that they are\npart of “the balance due and owed by [the Port Authority] under [this ] contract.” To the contrary, this contract expressly\nprovided that the Port Authority would have no liability for any delay damages. And while I agree that “the balance due and\nowed ... under the contract” can include “compensation for ... owner-caused delays,” compensation for owner-caused delays\nare not part of the balance due and owed under this contract, which stated that the contractor “shall receive no financial\ncompensation for delay or hindrance to the Work ... EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM,\nARISES OUT OF OR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF THE CONTRACT OR\nOTHER FAULT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY.”\n\n\n\nA.

Entergy Gulf States, Inc., 376\n       S.W.3d 742, 747 (Tex.2012).\n\n\n\nIn the context of payment obligations, the term “balance” means “the difference between the debits and credits of (an\naccount).” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 170 (10th Ed.). The term “due” means (1) “payable; owing; constituting a debt,”\nwhen used in relation to a “fact of indebtedness,” or (2) “immediately enforceable,” when used in relation to “the time of\npayment.” Bryan A. Garner, A DICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE, 298–99 (2nd ed.); see also Black’s Law\nDictionary 609 (10th Ed.). The Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage notes that the second definition, “immediately\nenforceable,” is “almost invariably the applicable one” today. DICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 299. And\nthe term “owing” means “[t]hat is yet to be paid; owed; due.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1279 (10th Ed.); see also\nDICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 633 (noting that “owed” is the preferred modern usage, over “owing”).\nThe difference between the terms “due” and “owed” is reflected in the fact that something can be owed but not yet due\nbecause the date for payment or the contingency on which payment is conditioned has not yet come to pass. See\nDICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 299. A “balance” that is both “due” and “owed” is thus an amount by\nwhich an account’s debits exceed its credits that is yet to be paid and immediately enforceable. Stated another way, a balance\ndue and owed is a mature debt. This understanding of the phrase is consistent with both the statutory context, which relates to\nrecoverable monetary obligations under a contract, and with our prior use of the phrase “due and owed” or “due and owing,”\nboth in our construction of this statute and more generally.6\n\n6\n       See, e.g., Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v. Clear Lake City Water Auth., 320 S.W.3d 829, 840 (Tex.2010) (“The existence of a balance ‘due\n       and owed’ is thus incorporated within the contract—a balance that would come due when voters approve payment in a bond\n       election.”); Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Mktg. on Hold Inc., 308 S.W.3d 909, 922 (Tex.2010) (“After rigorous analysis, the trial court found\n       that the alleged misrepresentation on each bill—an amount due and owing for a municipal charge—‘is uniform to all members of\n       the class....’ ”); Bailey v. Cherokee Cnty. Appraisal Dist., 862 S.W.2d 581, 587 (Tex.1993) (“There is little question that debts,\n       including ad valorem taxes, that are due and owing by an individual during his lifetime are liabilities of that individual.”)\n       (emphasis omitted); Summers v. Consol. Capital Special Trust, 783 S.W.2d 580, 581 (Tex.1989) (“On October 1, 1983, the Sill\n       note became due and owing.”); Sherman v. First Nat. Bank in Ctr., Tex., 760 S.W.2d 240, 241 (Tex.1988) (“In December of 1981,\n       Sherman received a letter from the Bank demanding the payment of several notes, including the $75,000 real estate note which was\n       not due and owing at that time.”); Inwood N. Homeowners’ Ass’n, Inc. v. Harris, 736 S.W.2d 632, 641 (Tex.1987) (“The\n       developer, or the association, is a general creditor who ... must stand in line along with [other creditors] for payment of sums due\n       and owing.”).\n\n\n\nImportantly, section 271.153 modifies the phrase “the balance due and owed” with the prepositional phrase “under the\ncontract.” TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1). Under the “rules of grammar,” see TEX. GOV’T CODE § 311.011,\na preposition (here, “under”) imposes a relationship between its object (here, “the contract”) and its antecedent (here, “the\nbalance due and owed”). See, e.g., THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE § 5.173, at 248 (16th ed.); Bryan A. Garner, THE\nREDBOOK: A MANUAL ON LEGAL STYLE, 176 (2nd ed.). As a result, section 271.153(a)(1) does not allow recovery of\nall amounts that may be “due and owed by the local governmental entity,” but instead limits the recovery to a due-and-owed\nbalance that arises “under” the written contract for goods and services *125 to which the statute applies. See TEX. LOCAL\nGOV’T CODE §§ 271.151(2)(A), 271.153(a)(1). Thus, under section 271.153(a)(1), the amount recoverable “is limited to”\nthe amount of all mature debts owed under a qualified contract, less any credits due.\n\nThe Court, by contrast, concludes that “[a] ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of damages for\nbreach of contract payable and unpaid.” Ante at 111. I do not agree that a “balance due and owed ... under a contract”\nincludes all common law damages regardless of whether they are contemplated in the parties’ contract. When a payment is\nnot provided for under the contract, but instead arises under the common law, that payment may later be due and owed under\nthe cort’s jud Aent, MMs not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.” See TEX.

Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\n\n\nThe Court’s construction of the statute is contrary to the statute’s language and its structure. First, the Court’s construction\nseparates the phrase “balance due and owed” from the phrase “under the contract,” and then alternatively reads each of them\nout of the statute. On the one hand, the Court equates the phrase “the balance due and owed” with the phrase “damages ...\npayable and unpaid,” ante at 111, and by doing so ignores the statute’s actual words. On the other hand, the Court treats the\nphrase “under the contract” as if it said “under a court’s judgment,” but does so only by relying on court opinions that address\ndamages under a contract, not a “balance due and owed ... under a contract.” Ante at 111 n. 62, 64. We must read the two\nphrases together, just as they appear in the statute, and the Court’s alternatives for each simply are not equivalents. By\nequating “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” with “the amount of damages for breach of contract payable and\nunpaid,” the Court shifts the focus from the mature debt that exists “under the contract” when suit is filed to prospective\nliability that a Court may impose in a breach of contract action.\n\nSecond, by holding that “a ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of damages for breach of\ncontract payable and unpaid,” the Court renders subsection (a)(1) a tautology. Under the Court’s construction, the amount of\ndamages that is recoverable for a breach of contract is “limit [ed]” to the amount of damages that is recoverable for a breach\nof contract. Under that construction, the amount of damages is not “limit[ed]” at all.7\n\n7\n       In response, the Court contends that the statute does “limit [ ] recovery” because “damages are but one item in a list that includes\n       attorney’s fees and interest, even if not provided for in the contract.” Ante at 113 n. 66. But section 271.153(a) places\n       “LIMITATIONS ON ADJUDICATION AWARDS” by authorizing courts to award only amounts that fall within the expressly\n       enumerated categories, which under the current version of the statute include:\n               • certain types of damages: “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” under section 271.153(a)(1) and “the amount\n               owed for change orders or additional work” under (a)(2);\n               • certain types of attorney’s fees: “reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees that are equitable and just” under (a)(3); and\n               • all interest allowed by law under (a)(4).\n          See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153. The Court’s reading of section (a)(1) does not alter the scope of recoverable\n          attorney’s fees or interest, it simply expands the scope of authorized damages to include all recoverable damages. Therefore, it\n          does not limit recoverable damages at all.\n\n\n\nThird, the Court’s construction of subsection (a)(1) renders subsection (a)(2) superfluous. Subsection (a)(2) expressly\nauthorizes the recovery of “the amount owed *126 for change orders or additional work the contractor is directed to perform\nby a local governmental entity in connection with the contract.” TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(2). If, as the\nCourt holds, subsection (a)(1) authorizes the recovery of all common law damages recoverable for breach of the contract,\nthen subsection (a)(1) already authorizes recovery of amounts owed for change orders and additional work, and subsection\n(a)(2) adds nothing to the mix.8 But if, as I contend, subsection (a)(1) only authorizes recovery of the amounts actually\nprovided for or contemplated within the contract (that is, “the balance due and owed ... under the contract”), then subsection\n(a)(2) adds to that any amounts owed for change orders and additional work that were not originally provided for or\ncontemplated in the parties’ contract.\n\n8\n       The Court responds that its construction does not render subsection (a)(2) superfluous because subsection (a)(2) “clarifies that\n       change orders can be the basis for recovery, even if it were argued that they were not ‘under the contract.’ ” Ante at 113 n. 66. But\n       this is exactly the point: under the Court’s construction, there is no need for such clarification because everything that the law\n       permits to be a basis for recovery in a breach of contract action (the only claim that can be brought under the statute) can be the\n       basis for recovery under the 271.153(a), regardless of whether it is “under the contract.”\n\n\n\nFinally, under the Court’s construction of subsection (a)(1), the exception to the exclusion of consequential damages in\nsubsection (b)(1) would completely swallow the rule. Subsection (b)(1) provides that recoverable damages may not include\n“consequential damages, except as expressly allowed under Subsection (a)(1).” Id. § 271.153(b)(1). As the Court notes,\n“[d]elay damages are consequential damages.” Ante at 114 n. 71. If subsection (a)(1) authorizes the recovery of all common\nlaw damages for breach of contract, then consequential damages, which are recoverable for a breach of contract, are\n“expressly allowed under Subsection (a)(1).” And in that case, subsection (b)(1) would not exclude any consequential\ndamages. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1), (b). In short, under the Court’s construction, subsection (a),\nwhich says recoverable amounts are “limited” to those specified in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4), does not in fact “limit”\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                    29\n\fZachry Const. Corp. v. Port of Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\nanything; and subsection (b), which says recoverable amounts “may not include” those listed in subsection (b)(1), does not in\nfact exclude anything.\n\nIn addition to the language of the statute, the Court’s holding contradicts our precedent on this very point. We have addressed\nsection 271.1 53(a)(1) in three prior decisions, and in each of them we have held, or at least indicated, that a “balance” is\n“due and owed ... under the contract” only if it is “stipulated,” “provided for,” or at least “contemplated” within the parties’\nwritten agreement. See Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v. City of Alton, 354 S.W.3d 407, 413 (Tex.2011) (“The kind of\ndamages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and are not a\n‘balance due and owed’ under that contract.”); Kirby Lake, 320 S.W.3d at 840 (holding that the damages sought were part of\nthe balance due and owed under the contract because “the Agreements do stipulate the amount of reimbursement owed upon\napproval of bond funds”); Tooke, 197 S.W.3d at 346 (holding that lost profits from additional work “are consequential\ndamages excluded from recovery under the statute”).\n\nIn Tooke, the Court held that the claimants could not recover after the City of Mexia prematurely terminated their service\ncontract because they “claim [ed] only lost profits on additional work they should have been given,” which “are\nconsequential *127 damages excluded from recovery under the statute.” 197 S.W.3d at 346; see TEX. LOCAL GOV’T\nCODE § 271.153(b)(1). If, as the Court holds today, “a ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of\ndamages for breach of contract payable and unpaid,” ante at 125, the Tookes should have been able to recover lost profits\nunder section 271.153(a)(1), and they should not have been excluded as consequential damages under subsection (b)(1)\nbecause they fall within the exception for consequential damages expressly authorized under subsection (a)(1). In short, the\nlost profits in Tooke were consequential damages not authorized under the parties contract, just as the Court recognizes\nZachry’s delay damages to be. Yet we held that the Tookes’ lost profits were not recoverable even though they, like Zachry’s\ndelay damages, were “damages ... payable and unpaid” and recoverable under the common law for breach of contract.\n\nSimilarly, in Sharyland, the contractor, the Sharyland Water Supply Corporation, sought to recover its “increased cost to\nperform” its contractual duty to repair and maintain a water system, which allegedly resulted from the City of Alton’s breach\nof its own contractual duties. 354 S.W.3d at 413. We held that section 271.153(a)(1) did not authorize Sharyland to recover\nits increased repair and maintenance costs because “[t]he kind of damages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for\nor contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and are not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract.” Id.9\n\n9\n       The Court notes that, in the next sentence in Sharyland, the Court stated: “Nor were these costs the ‘direct result of owner-caused\n       delays or acceleration....’ ” Ante at 113 n. 69 (quoting Sharyland, 354 S.W.3d at 413). The Court asserts that, by this sentence, we\n       treated the “including” clause at the end of subsection 271.153(a)(1) “as stating independently that delay damages are\n       recoverable,” and “we suggested that if [the damages sought had been for owner-caused delays], they would have been recoverable\n       even if neither ‘due and owed under’ nor ‘provided for or contemplated in’ the contract.” Id. The Court reads far too much into this\n       language. What we actually said in Sharyland was:\n             The kind of damages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and\n             are not a “balance due and owed” under that contract. Nor are these costs the “direct result of owner-caused delays or\n             acceleration,” or the “amount owed for change orders or additional work the contractor [was] directed to perform by [the]\n             local governmental entity in connection with the contract.”\n          Sharyland, 354 S.W.3d at 413. We thus addressed all provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), demonstrating that there was\n          no possible basis on which any of them could have authorized the recovery of the repair and maintenance costs that Sharyland\n          sought. See id. Sharyland did not argue that its damages were independently recoverable as “owner-caused delay damages,” and\n          we did not address the issue for which the Court now cites this language. See id. Instead, we simply explained that the damages\n          Sharyland sought did not fit within any of the descriptions in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2). See id. And, consistent with Tooke and\n          Kirby Lake, we equated “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” with the amounts “provided for or contemplated” in\n          the parties’ agreement. See id. I address the issue of whether the “including” clause at the end of subsection (a)(1) authorizes\n          delay damages that are not “due and owed ... under the contract” in the next section.\n\n\n\nIn Kirby Lake, by contrast, we held that the damages the claimant sought were recoverable as “the balance due and owed ...\nunder the contract” because “the Agreements do stipulate the amount of reimbursement owed upon approval of bond funds.”\n320 S.W.3d at 840 (emphasis added). Consistent with the language of the statute and our precedent, I would hold that section\n271.153 does not authorize Zachry to recover its delay damages because those damages are not provided for or contemplated\nin the parties’ agreement, *128 which instead expressly bars recovery of delay costs, and thus are not part of “the balance due\nand owed by the [Port Authority] under the contract.” See TEX.

Port of Houston Authority of Harris County, 449 S.W.3d 98 (2014)\n57 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\n\n\n\nB. “Including Any Amount Owed as Compensation for the Increased Cost to Perform....”\n\nRelying on the language at the end of section 271.153(a)(1), the Court asserts that “Section 272.153(a)(1) does not require the\n‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ to be ascertainable from the contract because, for one thing, this Section\nexpressly includes ‘any amount owed as compensation ... for owner-caused delays,’ an amount which cannot be determined\nin advance, when the contract is executed.” Ante at 111. To the extent the Court is arguing that the statute authorizes recovery\nof amounts that are not quantified in the contract or ascertainable at the time of contracting, I agree. Amounts need not be\nquantified in the contract or ascertainable at the time of contracting to be “due and owed ... under the contract.” Delay costs,\nin particular, cannot be quantified at the time of contracting because the parties cannot predict the length of the delay or how\nthe delay will impact the contractor’s work. But parties can, and sometimes do, agree that the owner will compensate the\ncontractor for owner-caused delays, and when they do, the delay costs are recoverable under the statute. Here, however, the\nparties did not agree that the Port Authority would compensate Zachry for owner-caused delays; instead, they expressly\nagreed that Zachry would receive “no financial compensation for delay or hindrance to the Work ... EVEN IF SUCH DELAY\nOR HINDRANCE” was owner-caused.\n\nThe Court misconstrues the language at the end subsection (a)(1) to independently authorize recovery of “any amount owed\nas compensation ... for owner-caused delays,” even if that amount is not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the\ncontract.” Ante at 111. In doing so, the Court overlooks the key word that connects these two phrases: “including.” The word\n“including” in this subsection does not expand the meaning of the words that come before it (“the balance due and owed”);\nrather, it limits the meaning of the words that come after it (“any [owner-caused delay damages]”) to “include” only those\nowner-caused delay damages that are in fact “due and owed.” See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY at 766 (defining\n“include” to mean “contain as part of something”). The Court thus reads subsection (a)(1) as authorizing recovery of the\nbalance due and owed ... under the contract and (or plus) any delay damages, when in fact the statute authorizes recovery of\n“the balance due and owed ... under the contract ..., including any amount owed ” as damages for owner-caused delays. TEX.\nLOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\nFor example, if a franchise agreement authorized a franchisee to operate “in any Texas city, including Athens,” the agreement\nwould permit operations in Athens, Texas, but not in Athens, Greece, or Athens, Georgia. The word “including” is not a\nsynonym for the word “and.” It does not expand the meaning of “any Texas city” to include Athens, Greece, or Athens,\nGeorgia, merely because those cities are also named “Athens.” Instead, it limits the scope of the reference to “Athens” to the\n“Texas city” by that name.10 In the *129 same way, the word “including” in subsection 271.153(a)(1) does not mean “and.” It\ndoes not expand the meaning of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” to include “owner-caused delay damages”\nthat are not due and owed under the contract. Instead, it limits the scope of the reference to “owner-caused delay damages” to\nthose “owner-caused delay damages” that are part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.”\n\n10\n       Or, to use the Court’s “more apt example,” see ante at 112 n. 65, the phrase “a city, including any named Athens,” includes any\n       city named Athens, which (as the Court notes) is “a longer list,” but it still only “includes” cities named Athens. It would not\n       include a corporation, or person, or pet named “Athens,” because the word “including” limits the second word “Athens” to those\n       that fit within the first word “city.” In the same way, the word “including” in section 271.153(a)(1) limits the second phrase “delay\n       damages” to those that fit within the first phrase “balance due and owed ... under the contract.” Any delay damages that are not part\n       of the balance due and owed under the contract are not “included” in the statute’s waiver.\n\n\n\nThe language the Legislature used in its most recent statutory waiver of immunity for breach of contract suits further\nconfirms this point. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 114.004. In this statute, through which the Legislature waived\nimmunity for certain contract claims against state agencies just last year, the Legislature used the same language it used in\nsection 271.153, but added a final clause to further clarify that the amount recoverable “is limited to”:\n\n            the balance due and owed by the state agency under the contract as it may have been amended,\n            including any amount owed as compensation for the increased cost to perform the work as a direct\n            result of owner-caused delays or acceleration if the contract expressly provides for that\n            compensation....\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Sup. Ct. J. 1378\n\nId. § 114.004(a)(1) (emphasis added). While the Court contends that the inclusion of the emphasized language gives this\nstatute a meaning that is different than the meaning of section 271.153(a)(1), which does not include the emphasized\nlanguage, that contention is unsupportable within this context. The language of sections 114.004 and 271.153 (and, for that\nmatter, 262.007) are in all material respects the same, demonstrating that the Legislature intended to follow a uniform\napproach in strictly limiting the scope of these statutory waivers of immunity. More importantly, by using the same\n“including” language that appears in section 271.153, section 114.004 confirms that both statutes only permit recovery of\nowner-caused delay damages that are “included” within “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.” If anything,\nsection 114.004(a)(1) narrows the scope of recoverable damages by requiring that the contract “expressly provide[ ] for” the\npayment of such compensation.\n\nParties to construction contracts often allocate unquantified costs between themselves, just as Zachry and the Port Authority\ndid with delay costs. Zachry and the Port Authority allocated all of Zachry’s delay-related expenses and losses to Zachry,\neven if the Port Authority was at fault for the delay. But parties to construction contracts sometimes choose a different\nallocation, obligating an owner to reimburse the contractor for some or all owner-caused delay costs. See, e.g., MasTec N.\nAm., Inc. v. El Paso Field Servs., L.P., 317 S.W.3d 431, 452 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2010) (involving construction\ncontract in which owner agreed to compensate contractor for certain owner-caused delays) rev’d, 389 S.W.3d 802 (Tex.2012)\n(holding that contract allocated all risk of unknown obstructions in construction path to contractor); Shintech Inc. v. Group\nConstructors, Inc., 688 S.W.2d 144, 148 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1985, no writ) (involving contract that allocated to\nthe owner’s account undue expenses incurred by the contractor as a result of owner-caused delays). If this contract had *130\nincluded such a clause, I would agree that whatever portion of the delay costs the Port Authority had agreed to pay would\nconstitute a balance due and owed by the Port Authority under the contract, and would thus be recoverable under section\n271.153(a)(1). But since the Port Authority did not agree to pay any of Zachry’s delay damages, and the contract does not\nprovide for or contemplate the Port Authority’s payment of such damages, those damages are not part of “the balance due and\nowed ... under the contract” and thus are not recoverable under section 271.153.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            III.\n\n\n\n                                                        Conclusion\n\nI agree with the Court that Zachry’s claim to recover installment payments that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated\ndamages are recoverable under section 271.153 and that Zachry did not unambiguously release that claim, but I would hold\nthat section 271.153 does not waive the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim for delay damages. Based on the\nlanguage and our prior constructions of the statute, I would hold that section 271.153 permits an award of delay damages\nonly if those damages are provided for or contemplated in the agreement and are thus part of “the balance due and owed ...\nunder the contract.” Because this contract did not provide for or contemplate the Port Authority’s payment of Zachry’s delay\ndamages, I would hold that Zachry’s delay damages are not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract”; section\n271.153 therefore does not authorize an award of those damages in this case; and thus section 271.152 does not waive the\nPort Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s suit for such damages.\n\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n57 Tex.

Equitable estoppel\n\n       Failure to comply by the Port is excused if Zachry is equitably estopped from asserting\n       that f<1ilure to comply. Equitable estoppel is established if all of the following\n       circumstances occurred:\n\n       I.       Zachry\n                a.     by words or conduct made a false representation or ~.:oncealed material\n                       facts when there was a duty to disclose,\n                b.     with knowledge of the facts or with knowledge or information that would\n                       lead a reasonable person to discover the facts, and\n                c.     with the intention that the Port would rely on the false representation or\n                       concealment in acting or deciding not to act; and\n\n       2.

Quasi-estoppel\n\n     Failure to comply by the Port is excused if the doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies. Quasi-\n     estoppel bars a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a\n     position previously taken by that party. This doctrine applies when it would be\n     unconscionable to allow a party to maintain a position inconsistent with one in which it\n     had acquiesced, or from which it had accepted a benefit.\n\n     Answer \"yes\" or \"no.''\n\n     Answer:                No\nD.

PH/\\ ·s response on page 40 asks the\n\n     Court to find tlwt \"'the Port had the express right under the Contract to issue the ·rcYise and\n\n     resubmit' response.'\" PHA 's point seems to be that it was free to ask Zachry to revise and\n\n     rcsLtbmit. but it did not order Zachry to do so nnd had no po\\ver to do so. and thcrelorc it could\n\n     not han: breached the contract by simply asking. nicely, that Zachry do                      SLl.

Zachry claims that\n\n    Pill\\ was not allowed to do so. and PIIA says it ncwr tried to. To that extent. at kast. those two\n\n    positions seem to line up in logical agreement to the Court.\n\n            The Court is unwilling to ruk. at this time. that no other pro\\·ision of the contract gave\n\n    PHA the right to prevent Zachry from conducting itsclrin a particular way. and some of the\n\n    provisions that PHA cites on pages 38 and 39 or its Response may in fact han:: allowed\n\n    something akin to at least partial rejection. The Court will have to hear more evidence                      ab~)ut\n\n\n    those proposed bases for rejection (though this is not intended to undo any prior ruling by this\n\n    Court regarding any particular clause ol'the contract). The Court                h~.:rchy   DENIES 7achr;'s\n\n    request for a determination as a matter of b\\v at this time that NO provision or the Contract gave\n\n    PI lAthe right to reject or otherwise command Zachry to conduct itself in a particular way. Even\n\n    ifno provision allowed Pll/\\ to complL.·tcly reject the frozen cutoiT\\\\:alL there may be other\n\n    pro\\·isions cited hy Pl-IA that gave PHA          th~   right to oth<.:rwisc limit/achry's conduct at the\n\n    project in whole or in part. At this point. the Court is not willing to say. as              :.1   matkr of law. that.\n\n    one or more of the provisions liskd in the boltom paragraph of page 39 of PHA ·s Response\n\n    could not bL· read tu limit Zachry's operations under the contract to some extent.

Zachry asks for a pretrial determination that none uJ' Zachry's\n\n      hreach of contract claims are harred by untimely notice. Previously, this Court denied PliA's\n\n      Motion for Summary Judgment that was bused on section 5.42 or the main contract. That section\n\n      provides for a live day notice period for Zachry after any interpretatiun or the Contract\n\n      Documents by any agent of PH/\\ i I' Zachry considered such an interpretation to he a change to\n\n      the contract. PHA argued that section 5.42 upplied to the claims asserted by Zachry and Zachry\n\n      argued that the section Jid not govern its claims in this lawsuit. and that the section was void\n\n      under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.071. The Court entered an order in\n\n      March 2009 denying the .\\t1otion for Summary Judgment and tinding that PI lA was not entitled\n\n      to summary judgment because it was not clear that the section was applicahle to the facts of this\n\n      case. The Court further found that the section was void under section 16.071 iJ' it was applicable.\n\n              The hasis for not finding that the section \\vas applicable as a m:.1ttcr        or law in t\\1arch 2009\n      \\\\as that the Court felt that thL· matter was controlled hy B.

PI I/\\ argued that the Du\\'il' ( 'o. case is neither on point IK'r\n\n      controlling because it applies to a situation       wh~:r~:   the contractor could bL· required to perform\nc\n\n      changes in the \\\\'ork, and the owner could unilaterally determine any            ad.ju~tment   in the contract\n\n      price to account for such changes. Jn contm:-;1. in this case, PHA argues, the provision is merely\n\n      :.1notice pro\\·ision. not a unilateral change in the scope or quantity oJ'work provision.\n\n\n;z:\n\f            The Court did not      articulut~   this   w~ll   at the   S~ptcmher      11. 2009     h~aring,   but upon further\n\n    ret1e~tion   and re-n:ading of the Daris Cu. case. it now understands the point that PIIA was\n\n    making: PH;\\\\; point is thut the Davis Co. case's \"radicul change'' issue did not have to do vvith\n\n    whether a contractual notice period applied to a radical change in                     th~   scope of the \\Vork, but\n\n    ruther. vvhethcr the radical change could           h~   unilaterally imposed in the scope           ol\"th~   work with\n\n    littk or no change in the amount of' the           C\\H11p~nsation.    That is. the Duris C'o. case. according to\n\n    PHA. only stands lor the proposition that an owner cannot impose radically mon: work upon the\n\n    contractor for the same price. but rath~r. such unilateral prerogative clauses only apply to minor\n\n    chang1..'S to the scope or amount of work. That. argues PI l1\\. distinguishes Dul'is C'o. !\"rom thi::;\n\n    case.\n\n            The Court does not see it that way. The Court still Jinds Dm·is Co. to be applicable to\n\n    this case because the clause at issue here. section 5.42. is a roundabout way of getting to the\n\n    same place. PllA argues that         s~ction   5.42 is different than       th~   facts of Doris Co. as section 5.42\n\n    only allows ti.!r an   ~:quitablc   adjustment irthcrc is a change order, which. by ddl.nitit!n, must he\n\n    agreed to by /.achry. That is to say. in the second paragraph of section 5.42. the cbusc states\n\n    that if Zachry gin:s the notice reg11rding the perceived change                   to   the contract. the Chief\" Engineer\n\n    or PHA \\vill conduct un investigation and determine whether the change will necessitate a\n    modilicution t1.1 the contract. und if so, whether to go forward. ft: and only if, the                     Chicl'Engine~:.T\n\n\n    determines that it is a change that will require u modilication. and decides to go forward, then the\n\n    Chief' Engineer \\Viii (perhaps) issue a construction               ch~mgc   Jirecti\\'e. or recommend to the\nc\n\n    Commission      w1   equit11hlc adjustment to the Contract Price as applicable. I lowcvcr, iithe Chid\n\n    Engin~~r     detem1ines thllt thL' contractor is wrong and the change                  pcrc~iwd    by the contractor is\n\n    not actually a chang~ requiring modi ticution. the Chief [ngi neer then will contact the contr::1ctor\n\n    and ''the determination by the Chief Engineer in such respect shall be final and conclusive.\" ln\nz\n\f      other words. in th~ end. it is a unilateral          d~krminution         by PHA     wheth~::r   a change. large or small.\n\n      is a ch~mge requiring modi lication to the wntract. PHi\\ 's argument that a change                           to th~   contract\n\n      price n::quirL'S a changL' L)rdcr that is, hy de!initinn. agreed to by /:1chry bas little meaning if it is\n\n      the PHA 's Chief Engineer that retains sole decision-making authority                        ov~:r   \\vhether a change\n\n      p~rceivcd    by Zachry requin:s a moditication to the contract price in the tirst pbce. That is why\n\n      the Coun believes that the Dm·is Co. case is. i r not controlling. at least persuasive. analogous\n\n      authority here. i\\ section like section 5.42 can only apply to non-radical changes. otherwise. just\n\n      as in the Da1·is C'o. case, it \\VOtild allow the owner to unilaterally change                    th~   scope of the work in\n\n      signiticm1t ways without atlording any rights               to   the contractor.-'\n\n               further. the Court continues to find that               ~:vcn   ir section 5.42 applies to this     cas~:.   it is void\n\n      under fe:-:as Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.071. PIIA argues strenuously that                                 th~:\n\n\n      Court errone-ously applied section 16.071 to this section and that the Texas                         Suprcm~    Court\"s\n\n      decision in .lmcricun ..Jirlinu.\\ l:.'mpluyeus Federal Credil Union\\' ..\\!arlin. :29 S.W.Jd 86.97-98\n\n      (TL·x. 2000) dictates thut section 5.4:2 is not void.

Th~ Court has now re-read the decision and still believes that that\n\n      case is not cLmtrolling here.\n\n               First, in Aml.:'rit:an Airlines, the Courl wus interpreting: the Uniform Commen:inl Code.\n\n      anJ in petrticular. section 4.406(J) \\\\hic-h requires a custnmc-r who rccei\\es a statement and\n\n      believes u payment \\vas not authorized to nutil'y the betnk \"promptly ...

That\n\nsection states that '·[a]ny notice not timely made by the Contractor shull he deemed a wai\\·cr by\n\nthe Contractor of its right to assert a claim in respect or such interpretation:· It is not analogous\n\nto the Americun Airlines or Fleck cases cited abuve.

The CLlUrl. quoting\n\n        the l.:mgungc- from Cili::ens Guaranty Bank above. concluded that regardless of the fact that it\n\n        \\vas ostensibly part    or a definitional paragraph. it was nevertheless a condition precedent to a\n        claim lor damuges that was voiJ under the predecessor to sc<:tion 16.071. !d. at 659. Of course.\n\n        a purpose ot'the notice requirements in insuram:e policies is, as in this case and in Amaican\n\n        Airlinl's. to allow the non-claimant to investigate the matter. Nevertheless. under !.at ham. that\n\n        notice rl:'quircment alsu acted as a conditiun precedent to a claim for damages. and was found to\n\n        he void. Likewise. the language regarding wain:r or a claim ir notice is                         not   provided under\n\n        section 5.42 is void.

This is a question of law for the Court, and the Court finds that Nexsrur\n\n    Broadcasling. Inc. d'b.;a KBTV NBC'    ..f   v. Gray. N. 09-07-364-CV. 2008 WL 25:21967, *2-*3\n\n    (Tex. App.-Beaumont June 26. 2008, no pet.) is controlling. The purpose of a liquidated\n\n    damages provision is to allow a party to n:cover damages where. at the time of contracting. it is\n\n    difticult or impossible to a..<;certain an amount of damages as a reasonable forecast of just\n\n    compensation. !d. at *3. The contract has to make clear that the amount ofliquidated damages\n\n    will be in lieu of other damages. HirdH\"ell r. Ferrell, 746 S. W.2d 338, 340 (Tex. App.-Austin\n\n    1988. no writ). This one does exactly the opposite by allo\\.ving the liquidated damages to be a\n\n    minimum, and allowing PliJ\\ to seek its actual damages instead if they exceed the liquidated\n\n    damages amount. Section. 5.06. There is no practical distinction between the contract in this\n\n    ca..'>e, and the contract in Nexstar even though in Nexstar the contract used the term \"additional\n\n    compensatory and consequential damages.\" 1lwugh unstated in this case, the language in\n\n    section 5.06 permits the exact same approach by PJ-IA.

The Court.\n\n         having considered PHA 's Request. Plaintiffs December 10, 2009 Response, as well as PHA's\n\n         Supplement to its Request and the arguments of counsel, is of the opinion that PHA 's Request\n\n         should be DEN JED .\n\n                The issue in this Request is the application ofTe)tas Rule of Evidence 107. Underlying\n\n         the request, generally speaking, is the following aspect of this trial. Under prior rulings by this\n\n         Court, Zachry hus to prove one or more common law exceptions to the no damages for delay .\n\n         clause contained in the Wharf and Dredge contract made the basis of this suit in order to defeat\n\n         that clause. One of those common law exceptions is referred to loosely in this record as the \"bad\n\n         faith exception,'' and Zachry contends that a certain promise that PHA 's Mark Vincent allegedly\n\n         made in an internal PHA e-mail, and which PitA then allegedly breached, is evidence ofbad\n\\()\n......\n 0       faith on PllA 's part. The promise, according to Zachry. was essentially that, as of May 2005.\n\n         PI JA would not charge liquidated damages ifPHA suffered no actual losses or harms by the time\n\n         the Chinese crane ship--scheduled tor first February 2006 and later May 2006--arrivcd.\n\n                In contrast, PH A e<:mtends that if any such promise was made. it related not to the date\n\n         tor the Chinese crane ship's arrival. but to a broader, more onerous Milestone A deadline, and\n cv\n E\n ::I\n 0\n 0\nCl\n\"0\n v\nt.=\n•t:\n v\n()\n                                                                                                    : 01112\n\f                                 •                                            •\n        potentially, the fi nal completion deadline. That is. PHA 's position is that if any \"promise\" was\n\n        made regarding liquidated damages, it was thot no LOs would he charged if PI lA sutlered no\n\n        actual damages or harms 1hrouglz the Milestone A deadline or, possibly. the eventual fina l\n\n        completion date of January 2009. It was not, PHA argues (if any promise was made), limited to\n\n        the date of arrival of the Chinese crane ship arrival.\n\n               Thus, PHA 's position is that the discussion by Zachry of the alleged \"promise\" not to\n\n        charge liquidated damages at all, coupled w ith ( I) the Andy Anderson April and May 2005\n\n        letters which mention the final completion deadl ine, as well as the \"milestone'' deadl ine, and (2)\n\n        Mr. Abiasi's recent testimony about ships routinely docking at the wharf during 2006 and 2007\n\n        (and possibly later), have opened the door to the introduction of evi dence by PHA of all of the\n\n        alleged \"harms\" (actual expenses and losses) allegedly suffered by PH A. T his discussion, PHA\n\n        contends, is necessary to rebut Zachry's bad fa ith aq,rumcnt by showing that, in fact, there 1\\'ere\n\n        actual ham1s suffered by PHA.    Therefore~   the arbrumcnt continues, even if thejury believes that\n\n        the promise related to the crane ship arrival or the Milestone A deadline (which PHA argues is a\n\n        much later date), PHA did in fact suffer actual harms. Thus, PH A contends, they did not hreach\n\n        any alleged promise because they indeed lzad actual harms. Indeed, they argue, if there was any\n\n        promise, they lived up to it.\n\n                         Texas Rule of Evidence I 07 - Rule of Optional Completeness\n\n                Under the case law pertaining to TRE 107. the Court believes that the door was opened as\n\n        to the discussion of actual harms up to the date of the May IS, 1006 letter in which PH A\n\n        communicated that it would charge liquidated damages. It is logical to conclude that it was on\n0\n\\0\n00      that date, at the very latest, that PHA decided it would charge liquidated damages, and at that\n0\\\n0\n\n;       therefore, under either version of the all eged promise (whether it wa<; the date of the Chinese\n ;..;\n u\n.D\n E      crane ship arrival. or the date of Milestone A completion), it had suffered actual harms at that\n :::s\nz\ncu\n E\n :::s\n u\n 0\nCl\n-o                                                         2\n 0\nt;:;\n'€\n<3\n                                                                                                  ~ 01113\n\f                              •                                                    •\ntime, or reasonably anticipated such actual harms to necessarily flow from the alleged delay.\n\nOtherwise, it would not have decided to charge liquidated damages at that time in light of either\n\nalleged version of the alleged promise (if there was uny promise at all).\n\n         Given this, the Court believes that the discussion of (I) the Andy Anderson letters of the\n\nSpring of2005. and (2) Mr. Vincent's e-mail as the basis of the alleged promise not to charge\n\nliquidated damages, and (3) Mr. Abiasi's discussion of the ships arriving rc&'Ularly after the\n\nChinese crane ship· .s arrival, is the same subject matter as PI!A· s alleged hann.s that were both\n\nactually incurred, and reasonably expected to be incurred as of the date it sent the May 15. 2006\n\nletter charging liquidated damages. See, Williams \\'. State, No. 12-01-0020 1-CR, 2003 WL\n\n356010,   •s (Tex. App.-Tyler February 19. 2003, pet. ref d) (not designated for publication).\nThe Court also bcliev<...'S that the discussion of the promise and the other ships· arrival uftcr the\n\nChinese crane ship's arrival could have leH the jury with the misimpression that PHA suffered\n\nno ac:wal harms that underlie their decision to charge liquidated damages on or about May 15.\n\n2006. !d. Thus, the test under TRE I 07 would seem to he .satisfied. 1\n\n         1t is important to note that in response to the Court's earlier \"open-the-door\" oral ruling,\n\nin which the Court stated that Zachry had opened the dollr allowing PHA to discuss evidence of\n\n\"any harms that occurred up to the date of the crane ship arrival,\" PHA stated that it had no\n\ndollar amounts of any harms it had actuall y sutlcrcd as of the date that the Chinese crane ship\n\nhad arrived. Very recently, however, PHA hegan to ar&'UC that while it had not suffered out of\n\n\n\n1\n   fun hcr. thflugh PHA 's counsel has pointed out thai this rea:>oning docs not seem 10 underpin C3Sl' law pertaining\nto TRE 107 (but rather, it applies to case law regarding trial by cons~nt). it is worth noting that the eviden~e of the:\n:;hips r~gularly arriving at th~ wharf during the ongoing con!'truction that Zachry adduced through Mr. Abiasi is\nrdcvant to rebut PI! A's allegation that Zachry took far too long to complete its work. Zachry says th!! cvidem:~ of\nships arriving during construction, and Zachry's accommodation of those arriving ships. explains some llr ollllf the\ndelays. Thus, 10 be fair, the cvidcnvc was aT!,'Uably not adduced Ill show that Pl lA sufTcrcd no hanns because ships\ncould arri\\'C at the wharf. Rather, it was adduced, in Zachry'!\\ view, to c.1tplain the delays of which it was accused hy\nPllA. So therefore, argues Zachry. it did not really OJXn the door because the cvidc:ncc: has rt:le\\o·anc<: 10 somtthing\nother than PHA 's alleged ha rms. PHA nonetheless argues that it do'<s not matter why it was introduced, out that the\nonly consideration is the jury's potential misapprchen:>ion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          =01114\n\f                                •                                              •\n       pocket losses or harms as of the date of the Chinese crane ship's arrival, it knew at that time that\n\n       it would necessarily suffer actual harms that would actually be incurred after that date. Why\n\n       PHA did not ask tor clarification of the Court's oral ruling to determine whether anticipated\n\n       harms ofwhicb it was aware as ofthc ~ate of the Chinese crane ship arrival date were included\n\n       in that ruling is unclear. Nevertheless, it is possible there is evidence of reasonably anticipated\n\n       actual harms of which PHA was aware as of the May 15, 2006 letter charging liquidated\n\n       damages. The Court has not heard this evidence as of the date ofthis Order.\n\n              To be clear, however, the Court believes that the door has only been opened to a dc1,rree.\n\n       It has onJy been opened to the extent that, if the Court were to allow the evidence to come in, it\n\n       would only do so to the point where PHA could discuss discrete categories of actual harms.\n\n       However, the Court would not al low PHA to discuss the specitic dollar amounts or quantities of\n\n       those alleged harms. Eliciting evidence of the types or categories or actual harms, the Court\n\n       believes. would allow PHA to correct any misimprcssion held by the jury that PHA suffered no\n\n       actual harms which would underlie or support its May 15, 2006 decision to charge liquidated\n\n       dum ages. There is no need to go the additional step of discussing the actual amounts of those\n\n       alleged harms.\n\n                                           Texas Rule of Evidence 403\n\n              Now, despite having opened the door to the discussion of the actual harms either actually\n\n       incurred as of the date of the May 15, 2006 liquidated damages letter, or those reasonably\n\n       anticipated as of that date which necessarily would have flowed from the alleged delays up to\n\n       that date, the Court believes the evidence should nevertheless be excluded under Texas Rule of\n0\n\\0\n00\n       Evidence 403. Zachry has also expressly objected to this evidence on Rule 403 grounds.\n0\\\n0\n\n~             First, the Court~ at the outset of the. trial. ruled that other than 3 specitic categories of\n ;_:\n Q)\n.D\n E     actual harms, because of late or no-supplementation of discovery, PITA would not be permitted\n ~\n;z:\ncQ)\n E\n ~\n 0\n 0\na                                                         4\n13\nt.::\n·t:\n Q)\nu\n                                                                                                   : Ol111~\n\f                            •                                           •\nto discuss 8 to 10 million dollars worth of alleged actual harms. Without modifying that ruling,\n\nthe main   rcas~m   for that decision was that the Court did not want to-at the last minute--\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the trial by adding many days or weeks of testimony about\n\nwhether those alleged harms were actually suffered, and in what amounts. Moreover, the Court\n\ndid not want to disrupt the trial by having the parties have to undertake substantial amounts of\n\ndiscovery in the middle of what already promised to be a lengthy trial. At bottom. it would have\n\nbeen unfair to inject all of that evidence of about $1 0 million worth of an offset claim by PHA\n\ninto the trial at the last moment. The Court does not believe that there is any basis to change that\n\nruling.\n\n          Second, undc=r Rule 403 , the Court believes that any probative value of injecting al l of the\n\nevidence of alleged hanns into the trial would be substantially outweighed by the danger of (I)\n\nunfair prejudice to Zachry, and (2) considerations of undue delay. In particular, not only would\n\nit take a lot of time for the information to be elicited in the tirst place from a PHA witness. it\n\nwould necessarily require a lengthy cross-examination. That cross-examination could very\n\nquickly devolve into a lcnhrthy battle over not only the nature of the alleged harms, but their\n\ncause and quantitication. As stated above, the reason this information was kept out in the first\n\nplace was because of dcticicncics in PI iA 's discovery responses. For Zachry to then have to\n\ncross-examine on this issue when it has not had a chance w conduct discovery ot' any\n\nsignificance on these issues would certainly be highly prejudicial. And, all of this testimony\n\nwould take a lot of time·- we are now in the 8111 week of testimony in this trial as of this writing.\n\n          Texas Rule of Evidence I 07 is subject to Rule 403.

Plaintiff Zachry is a DelmvaJe corporation, ·with its principal place of business in\n\nSan Antonio, Bexar County, Texas.\n\n       2.      Def'endant PHA is a Texas novigation district established under i\\rticle XVI,\n\nSection 59 of the Texas Constitution, with its prim:,ipal place of business in Houston, Harris\n\nCounty, Texas. Defendant PHA has appeared .in this lawsuit and may be served through its\n\n\n                                                    1\n\fcounsel of recordt David H.

Venue is proper in this Court as Harris County is the county \"in which all or\n\nsubstantial part of the events ... giving rise to (this] claim occutred.'' TEX. Ctv. PRAC. &REM.\n\nCor>t~    ANN. § 15.002(a)(l). Venue is also proper as Harris County is the county of PHA's\n\n\"principal office in this state.''   TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §       15,002(a)(3). Finally,\n\nvenue is proper in this Court because Harris County is the county in which the parties have\n\n\"contracted in writing to perform. an oblfgation,H expressly naming Harris County in that 'Nriting.\n\nTt::X.   C!v, PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 15,035(a).\n\n                                          !V.   Jurisdiction\n\n          4.     Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy is in excess of the\n\nminimal judsdictional requirements of this Court. Further, this Conrl has personal jurisdictitm\n\nover Defendant as it is a Texas navigation district located in Harris County. Texas.\n\n          5.     This court has jurisdiction over this suit against PHA because the Texas\n\nlegislature has waived sovereign immunity from suit \\vhh respect to breach of contract claim!l\n\nagainst navigation districts such as PHA. TEx. Lac, Gov;T CODE ANN. § 271.151, et seq.\n\nFurther, it is well settled that when the State or a political subdivision contracts with private\n\ncitizens~   as PHA has done, it waives sovereign immunity from liability. See Tooke v, Ciiy of\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\flvfexlat 197 S.W.3d 32:5,332 (Tex. 2006); Gen. Servs. Comm 'n v, Little~1ex. Insulation Co., Inc.•\n\n39 S. \\VJd 591, 594 (Tex. 2001). Tl1is suit involves claims for PHA's breach of a written\n\ncontract within the Textis Legislature 1 s express waiver of sovereign immunity. TEX. Loc. Gov'T\n\nCODE ANN. § 271.1        Bayport Phase l A Wharf and Dredging Contract (H\\l·/h.arf and Dredge\n\nContract\").1 Based on !he facts alleged below, Zachry seeks to recover damages under §§\n\n27L153(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Texas Local Government Code. Accordingly, PHA may not\n\nassert sovereign immuni.ty from suit or from liability with respect to the claims asserted herein.\n\n\n\n       6.      On or about June 1, 2004, af\\er soliciting proposals and awarding the project to\n\nZachry, PHA and Zachry executed the \\Vharf and Dredge Contract Pursuant to the written\n\n\\Vharf and Dredge Contract, Zachry was to construct a J 660...:foot wharf facility in Pasadena,\n\nTt:xas. Under the original terms of the Wharf and Dr<:dge Contruct, construction \\Vas to be\n\ncompleted by June 1, 2006, ln addition, by February l, 2006, Zachry wa.') to meet an intertm\n\ndeadline by which a portion of the wharf PHA had designated {\"Milestone A\") would be\n\nsufficiently completed supposedly to allow the delivery of certain large ship~teH;hore cranes that\n\n\\Vere to be delivered by ship from China.\n\n       7.      Shortly thereafter, Zachry began construction of the wharf: At the     outset~   and as\n\nPHA understood before it awarded Zachry the contract) Zachry's chosen construction\n\nmethodology and construction plans involved the construction of a temporary frozen shoring\n\n\n\n       1\n          Because the Wharf and Dredge Contract is too volurninous to physically attach to this\npetition, Zachry hereby expressly incorporates by reference the copy of the Wharf and Dredge\nContract filed hy Defendant PHA as .Exh.ibit B to its Plea to the Jurisdiction and to Hs First\nSpecial Exceptions.\n\n                                                 3\n\fwall {a \"'freeze wall'') al<mg the ch;mnel side of the wharf,         The   freeze~wall   construction\n\nmethodology involved building a large berm along the channel side of the wharf, placing pipes\n\ninto the berm, circu!at1ng a sub-iteezing brine solution through the pipes, and freezing the.\n\nearthen berm into a frozen soil mass or walL The resulth1g freeze wall would allow Zachry to\n\nexcavate the earth between the channel and the fmthcoming \\Vharf, under the wharf deck, and\n\namong the wharf's piers in dry conditions without having to resort to more difficult and more\n\ncostly mechanical dredging and \"'vet\" excavation techniqt1es. Based upon this known plan,\n\nZachry proceeded to build the earthen berm, gather and place the pipes necessary to crea.tc the\n\nfreeze wall into the berm, drive support piles, and generally work toward fulfilling its contractual\n\nobligations by executing its construction n1e1hodology.\n\n       8.      In or before March 2:005, because     Pl1A~s   contractual design underestimated the\n\nwharf length nec:essaq to meet its own wharf demand, PHA notified Zachry that it needed to\n\nincrease the size ofthe \\VharfZachry \\Vas then building. PHA's original wharf design (for which\n\nPHA had contracted vvith Zachry to build and which Zachry was building at the time) was not\n\nlong enough to accommodale the volume and/or type of ship traffic that was expected to call at\n\nBayport upon the fac-ility's opening. 2 .Due to its o\\vn error) PHA requested that Zachry submit a\n\nproposal to construct a longer wharf than the one for \\Vhi.ch the parties had originally contracted\n\nin the Wharf and Dredge Contract. Specifically, PHA requested that Zachry provide a proposal\n\nto add an additional 332 feet in length of wharf to the existing design, thereby substantially\n\nincreasing the siG:e of the wharf and !.he amount of remaining work. ln addltiont because PBA\n\n\n\n       2\n        The determination ofthe wharflength for which the Port c011tractcd in the original\nWharf & Dredge Contract was u rnalter solely wiihin PHA's control.\n\n                                                 4\n\fhad also underestimated the size of the Chinese     crane~delivery   ship, PHA also later requested a\n\nsubstantial increase in the size of Milestone A so that the cranes used to operate the facility could\n\nbe docked and unloaded?\n\n         9.       PHA1 :s immediate need for an additional 332-foot section of wharf required\n\nZachry to re\\vork its construction methodology. In early April 2005: in response to PHNs\n\nsolicitation of Zachry for a proposal to perform the additional work PHA needed, Zachry\n\ndescribed to PHA the construction methodology modification that it would need to perfom1 the\n\nwork. Specifically, PHA's new design necessitated a critical modification to Zachry's freeze\n\nwall construction methodology,\"·,,the addition of a freeze \\Vall that would run perpendicular to lhe\n\noriginal freeze \\Vall (the perpendicular \\vall being referred to herein as the 11 frozen cutoff wall\"),\n\nTl1e frozen cutoff waH was needed so that Zuch1y could similltuneously accomplish three main\n\nobj~;;ctives;   (l) completing Milestone A on time; (2) allowing the Chinese ship carrying the\n\ncranes to dock 1 unload, and depart; and, critically (3) maintaining the remainder of the wharf\n\n(i.e,, the non~Mllestone A portion of the wharf) i.n the dry so that Zachry's construction\n\nmethodology could continue to be irnplemented. On April 13, 2005, Zachry provided a written\n\npropostll to perfom1 the a.dditio1ia:l work PHA needed for      a certain price,   Zachry's price \\\\'as\n\nexpressly conditioned on Zachry's \"[u]se of a freeze wall-cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) 'B'\n\nrowpiling,\" which \\Vas exactly \\vhat Zachry had previously described to PHA.\n\n         10.      In August 2005, PHA, informed Zachry that it intended to issue a change order\n\nauthorizing the additional work PHA had requested,           Ftowcverl   PHA~-\\vhHe     continuing to\n\n\n\n        3\n         The designation ofthe length of the Milestone A portion of the \\Vharfwas a matter\nsolely Within PHA's controL\n\n\n                                                  5\n\frequest that Zachry cr.mstruct the iiddhional wharf section·~simultaneously informed Zachry that\n\nuntil it issued that change order, Zachry would proceed at its      O\\Vtl    risk . On or about September\n\n12. 2005, at Pl·IA's request. Zachry presented PHA with a detailed design of the frozen cutoff\n\n\\'Vall that Zachry planned to use in connection with the c.bange order work as provided under ils\n\nproposal. That design was consistent with Zachry's prior description of the frozen cutoff walt\n\n          11.      On September 27, 2005, two weeks after Zachry had provided its frozen cmoff\n\n\\Vall design, PHA executed Change Order Nurnber 4. ofl1cially agreeing that Zachry was to\n\npertbrm the additional work under the terms set forth in Zachry's proposal, unless otherwise\n\nspecified in the modifications to the April 13 proposal that were made in the change order.\n\nChange Order 4 never rnodified Zachry's April 13 proposal            tt'l   exclude the use of the frozen\n\ncutoff wall and, thus. the frozen cutoff wall was approved. in Change Order Number 4. Change\n\nOrder Number 4 clearly and expressly contemplated the use of the frozen cutoff wall design in\n\nthe C(m1pletion of the \\Vharf-indecd, it was the explicit basis for the negotiation of pricing and\n\nscheduling under Change Order Number 4. But just two weeks after executing Change Order\n\nNumber 4, PHA changed course and precluded Zachry from implementing its proposed,\n\ncontracruaJJy approved frozen cutoffwall design. PHA rejected that design. 4\n\n          12,      PHA's rejection of Zachry~s trozen cuwtf walL which actively interfered with\n\nZachry's      \\VOrk,   was done in bad ta.ith, arbitrarily, capriciously, and without any legitimate or\n\nreasm1ahle bash~. 5 Moreover; despite recognizing this immediately as a geotechnical problem,\n\n\n          4\n              Stated another way. PHA impermissibly precluded Zachry from implementing the\ndesign.\n          5\n              PHA' s bad faith, arbitrary, and capricious conduct, which interfered with Zachri s\n\\Vork, is described in greater detail in Zachry's discovery responses.\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fPHA did not bother to engage its gedtechnicaJ engineer, GeoTest> until after PHA had rejected\n\nthe frozen cutoff walL Moreover, nothing in GeoTest's report would support a rejection of the\n\nfrozen cutoff wall. 1n addition, PHA's own Chief Engineer, who had the ultimate responsibility\n\nat PHA for resolving all engineering questions on the project, admitted that PHA did not have\n\nenough infom1ation to judge whether or not the freeze wall violated the standard of care. He also\n\nadmitted that no one at PHA had concluded that there would be an adverse impact or that the\n\ncutoff wall design in any way violated the standard of care. Further demonstrating the Port's bad\n\nfaith, arbitrary, and capricious conduct regarding the rejection, Zachry's freeze wan          experts~\n\nGeoEngineers, provided additional research demonstrating that there was no adverse affec.t to\n\nfreezing the :soil around the drilled shafts. Consistent with the freeze \\Vall expert's opinions at the\n\ntime, PllA's Construction Manager, CH2MHILL, provided the frozen cutoff wall design to its\n\nown in-bouse geoteclmicaJ engineering experts, who returned comments confirming that the\n\nproposed frozen cutoff \\Vall design did not pose any issue. PHA's own expert .in this lawsuit has\n\nlikewise testified that the frozen cutoff wall was a viable and safe design and that he had no basis\n\nto believe it would have any negative impact on the structure.\n\n        13.     Another example of the Port's bad faith,    arbitrary~   and. capricious conduct is the\n\nfact that PHA expressly charged and designated its Construction Manager, CH2MHILL, to act\n\non its behalf on this critical cutoff wall issue despite the fact that PHA knew and understood that\n\nCH2MH1LL had a poor record and was HI-equipped to deal with such an issue. Indeed, PHA had\n\npreviously admitted that CH2MHLL responded to project and design issues in a ''CYA\"' mode\n\nrather than appropriately addressing the issues. This CYA approach was evidenced again when\n\neven after identifying any issues concerning freezing as geotedmical h1 nature, even after\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  i.\n\freceiving CH2MHILL's senior geotechnical engineering experts' opinions stating they did not\n\nsee a problem, and even after receiving Zachry's freeze waH expert's           follow~up   analysis   re~\n\nconfinning there was not a problem CH2MH1LL·-PHA 's designated agent on this cutoff wall\n\nissue--communicated several problems from a \"structural engineering perspective,\" none of\n\nwhich were viable concerns, none of which were assessed prior to the Port's rejection> and all of\n\nwhich were simply designed to divert any potential liability from CH2MHfLL. On October\n\nlO~espite    the unanimous approval from freeze wall experts on both. sides and notwithstanding\n\nthe fact th<\\t PHA had not even hired its own geotechnical engineer to look at this issue (much\n\nless nx:cived the result of any such review), PHA rejected the fq.:cze, walL\n\n       14.      PHA 's reJection of the frozen cutoff wall constituted a breach of both Change\n\nOrder 4 and the General Conditions of the Wharf & Dredge Contract. 6 Notwithstanding PHNs\n\n\"'bail and switch\" tac:tics·-including PHA 1 s delay in approving Change Order Number 4 and\n\nsubsequent improper   r~jection   of the frozen cutoff wall methodology stated 1n Change Order\n\nNumber 4--PHA remarkably continued to insist that Zachry complete the expanded project\n\nvtithin the parameters set forth in Change Order Number 4.\n\n       15.     Moreover, when it executed Change Order 4, PHI\\. had no present intent to>\n\nperform its requirement that Zachry be permitted the right to use the frozen cutoff wall. Texas\n\nlaw clearly provides that when one enters into an agreement that it has no present intent to\n\nperfonn, this constitutes fraud. Here, on September 27, 2005 PHA executed a contract that\n\npe1mitted Zachry to use the frozen cutoff waiL PHA induced Zachry to agree this contract at a\n\n\n       6\n         Alternatively, to the extent PHA contends that it only require<;l Zachry to ''revise and\nresubmit\" its frozen cutoff\\vall design, such conduct also constituted a breach of Change Order\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fprice and schedule based on a particular frozen cutoff wall design. PHA then rejected the very\n\ndesig11 that formed the basis for the contract only days after signing the agreement because it\n\nnever intended to allmv Zadrry to use the fi•ozen cutoff wall. To this day PHA denies that it ever\n                                                                                           7\nintended to approve Zachry's use the frozen cutoffv•tall \\Vhen executing Change Order 4.\n\n        16,     Zachry, unable to implement the agreed-upon frozen cutoff wall construction\n\nmethod due to PHA 's conduct, found itself short on thne because the work needed to be\n\ncompleted under the freeze. \\vall approach 1 the Port had precluded the use of that approach, and\n\nthere was a crane ship that was to arrive frnm China in the near f\\rture. Thus, after a review of\n\nthe alternative proposed solutions) Zachry ultimately decided it would have to forego the entire\n\nfreeze-wall construction method in order to prepare the wharf in a rnanner that would allow the\n\nChinese crane ships to dock and unload. Zachry therefore was forced in large part to complete.\n\nthe wharf using unanticipated \"'wet'' excavation techniques.       hl doing so, Zachry incurred\n\nsubstantial additional costs. The completion of interim Milestone A and the entire project was\n\ndelayed as a result, as well.\n\n        17.     Even though the delays were caused by PHA's breach of the Wharf ar1d Dredge\n\nContract, PHA has withheld and threatens to further withhold liquidated daxnages based on an\n\nunenforceable penalty provision in the contract. First, because the purported liquidated damages\n\nprovision attempts to enforce liquidated damages vvhilc simultaneously allowing (and, indeed\n\ncalling tor) the recovery of actual damages, it is void as a matter of Texas law. Second, the\n\nliquidated damages provision is unenforceable because PHA suffered no harm. Third, the\n\n\nNumber 4 and the General Conditions of the Contract\n\n        i PHA's bad-faith, fraudulent; arbitrary, and capricious conduct tKtively interfered with\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fliquidated damages provision is unenforceable because Zachry's compliance with the contractual\n\ndeadlines \\Vas precluded by PHA's own errors and misconduct.\n\n        18.     By its conduct, PITA has breached the Wharf and Dredge Contract in several\n\nrespects.     Jn particular by precluding Zachry lrom implementing its frozen cutoff wall\n\nconstntction methodology and ultimately the entire freeze wall construction methodology, PHA\n\nhas breached Change Order 4 and Section 5. l 0 of the Wharf and Dredge Contract. See Change\n\nOrder Number 4 to Wharf and Dredge Contract; Wharf and Dredge Contract 11 5.10. PHA has\n\nfurthet breached the Wharf and Dredge Contract by \\vrongful!y witltholding as \"liquidated\n\ndamages'' sltms nthenvise due Zachry under the Wl1r1rf & Dredge Coutntct pursuant to an\n\nunenforceable penalty clause and for time overruns that were themselves caused by PHA's\n\nconduct. See Wharf and Dredge Contract, 1j 5.05, ~. 5.06, Addendum No.8 (lll·15) (purporting to\n\nprovide PHA the right to recover liquidated damag.es as a dttmage \"f1oor,\" while also purporting\n\nto allow recovery of actual damages if they exceed the          liq\\tidated~damages   amount).

The conset1uences of PHA 's misconduct have caused Zachry significant damage,\n\nPHA 's bad faith conduct, at its core, derives from PHA 's bmTmucratic mentality, incompetence,\n\nand desire to punish Zachry for asserting its legal rights. This is evidencc,d by, in addition to the\n\nmatters pleaded above, PH A's racking up of excessive, unreasonable, and urmecessary legal fees\n\nas a means of attempting to mtinufactuni a meritless cmmterc1aim, delay the payment of it.s\n\nobligations under the \\Vharf & Dredging Contractj and avoid the payment of its debt by spending\n\nZachry into submission. PHA 's bad faith pauem ofconduct has persisted up until the present,\n\nincluding PFIA's rec.ent additional bad faith steps at the end of the project done in order ro\n\nsqueeze its contractor. This bad faith conduct includes PHA 's apparent decision to stop pS.)'ing\n\nZachry's invoices {including .invoice Number 39), PHNs failure to declare that the status of\n\nZachry's \\vork under the 'A'harf & Dredge contract is complete despite (11) that fact that it is\n\ncomplete, and (b) its contractual obligation to determine the status of the Work, and PHA 1 s\n\ntallurc to permit an assignment of the contract without a legitimate basis to the affiliated Zachry\n\n\n\nof the Contract Docurnents. n ld. at 2.

The Wharf\n\nand Dredge Contract, including vvithout limitation all Change Orders and Addenda to the Wharf\n\nand Dredge Contract, is a legally binding \\Witten agreement within the meaning of Texas Local\n\nGovernment Code Section 271.152.         Zachry has performed and continues to perfom1 its\n\nobligations under the Wharf and Dredge Contract, or alternatively, was prevented from\n\nperforming certain obligations by PHA's material breach of contract.          Zachry has met all\n\nconditions precedent to recovery. 10 As detailed above, the Wharf and Dredge Contract l1as not\n\n\n       9\n            On December lZ, 2007, Zachry notified PHA that the remaining work on the project\n(as of January 1, 2008) would be completed by the same personnel) but thatthe personnel \\Vould\nbe employed by a sister Zachry affitiate due to a Zachry corporate reorganization. On. January\n181 2008, PHA indicated that lt was \"prepared to approve such assignment\" to Lhe Zachry\naffiliate that finished the project work as of January 1, 20081 but under certain conditions. Ghien\nPHA' s lack of consent to the assignment, Zachry did not assign the contract. Instead, it\ncompleted the project as it had described to PHA in December 2007. On April 7, 2009. with the\nconditions PHA previously stated satisfied by the cm11pletion of the \\York and/or by additional\nZachry assurances provided, Zachry again requested the assignment of the Cm1tract; PHA has\nnot responded and, thus, not pennitted the Contract's assignment. Accordinglyt given PHA's\nrecent bad faith conduct with regard to its lack of consent to assignment and in an abundance of\ncaution, Zachry has entered into a pass~through agreement with its af11liate. Under that\nagreement, Zachry would be entitled to recover the darnages incurred by and through its anlliate\n(approximately $8,5.78,712 of the damages alleged by Zachry) because Zachry would be liable to\nits aniliate for damages sustained by the subcontractor pursuant to the pass~tlu·ough agreement.\nSee Interstate Contracting Corp. v. City of Dallas, 135 S.W. 3d 605, 607 (Tex. 2004). Under\nthat agreement. Zachry is obligated to remit certain recoveries to its affiliate. /d. at 619-20.\nUnder Texas law, PHA has waived its sovereign immunity for such claims. See Hensel Phelps\nConst. Co. v.

Those damages generally include the following\n\ncategories of damages; ( 1) the difterence bet\\veen the cost that Zachry would have Incurred had\n\nil been a!Imved to complete the wharf \"in the. dry\" (i.e.• using the frozen cutoff wall) and the\n\nactual cost Zachry incurred in completing the wharf \"in the wet\" (i.e., wilhout the frozen cutoff\n\n\\.vall), (2} liquidated damages and pena!Ues \\Vrongfully \\vithhe!d by PielA, in the amounl of\n\napproximate!:>• $2,360,000, (3) damages in the amount of approxhnately $6()0,000 that has been\n\nwrongfully withheld by PHA as a purported ''offset,n and (4) damages for the remainder of the\n\nContract Price, which the Port has refused to pay. Zachry is also entitled to interest as allowed\n\nby laYv, including pre~ and post.:jud:;,rn1<:mt interest.\n\n        23.      ln regards to the fitsi category ofdamages listed above, Zachry has designated an\n\nexpert witness, Oary W.

Zachry denies that it breached the \\Vharf &\nDredge Contract. ln the alternative, to the extent PHA alleges that Zachry committed any\nmaterial breach of the Wharf & Dredge Contract1 J)HA has deprived itself of the defense of prior\nmaterial breach because it elected to treat the Wharf & Dredge Contract as continuing and, in\nadditiont insisted that Zachry perfonn the \\Vharf & Dredging Contract.\n        11 Because construction of the \\Vharffacility is ongoing Zachry's total damages are\n                                                                1\n\n\n\n\n                                                      13\n\fZachry's economic darnagcs and the method by which those damages have been calculated.

Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas R11lcs of Civil Procedure, the P<lrt Authority\n\ngcneraliy denies the allegations of Plaintiff Zachry Gonstructit)ll Corporation (HZachryll).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     EXHIBIT\n\f                                STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n        3,     The Port Authority is charged with mvning, building, and operating tho publically\n\nowm.:d portions of the Port of Houston. Among the lund owned and operated by the Port\n\nAuthority is the vast Bayport Tenninal Complex    (\"Bayport~').   tn 1998, the Port Authority began\n\ndeveloping a master plan for Bayport that includes some 7)000 linear feet of wharf, modern shlp·\n\nto-shon:1 oranes for mpid loading and unloading of cargo~ 380 acres of container yards) and a\n\ncruise terminal. These facilities are being developed over timej with the design and timing of\n\neach phm;e tlctom1ined by market demand, availability of funds 1 and environn:tt.mtfll permitting\n\nlimitations.\n\n       4.      By 2003, the Port Authority was ready to begin building what is latown as Phase\n\nlA ofBayport, which lndudtxll,660 linear feet ofwhar( dredging~ an adjoining container ;'atd,\n\nand rclatt!d facilities. 'I'he engineeriog design called for the wharf to be supported by more than\n\nI ,100 concrete piers drilled to various depths (some to u depth of 120' below sealevel).\n\n        5.     The Port Authority solicited competitiv<l     set~ted   proposals for the contract\n\nZachry, while not the low proposer, Sllbmitted a proposal wilh scvcnd attractive features.   Thes<:.~\n\nim::luded 1 most prominently, Zuchrts proposal to build the wharf by using unconventional\n\nmeans by first drilling the piers and installing the wharf deck on <ky la.nd and then excavating\n\nunder the wharf deck and among the piers \"in the dry, 1'\n\n       6.      Znclwy proposed to create the dry environment for ils work beneath the wlmrf\n\ndook by usc of a freeze walL Tho freeze wall would be created by installing a network of\n\nhundreds of''itooze pipes\" in an earthen berm or cofferdmn along tho wharrs entire channclsidc\n\nlenglh. Zachry would then circulate sub~ freezing brine through the freeze pipes, ceeat1ng a wall\n\nof frozen soil strong enough to stand without other structural support ami strong enough to hold\n\fback the bay water while Zachry excavated beneath the wharf deck and around the wharf.\n\nZachry did not propose to use a freeze wall on the land side of the excavation; it planned to use\n\nconventional dewatering techniques to deal \\Yith groundwater infiltration from !he land side.\n\nOnce the excavation was complete; Zachry would remove the freeze pipes, thaw and breach the\n\nwall to admit the bay waters 1 and clred ge away the soil.\n\n        7.      Zaclu·y's freeze wall proposal offered the Port Authority a creative way in which\n\nto meet federal standards regarding emissions of nitrogen oxides. ln seeking the award of the\n\ncontrm:;t1 Zachry made other representations that were attractive to the Port Authority. Zachry\n\npledged to involve Rnmll businesll enteq)dses in the project and to work with the Port Authority\n\nin a cooperative spirit. lt tonted itselfas a large and expetienced construction company that had\n\nsuccessfully undertaken other Jlovel and cotnplex projects, and represetited that would undertillte\n\nappropriate due diligence to detr.:11:nine how to capably und compe~ently prosecute the Phase lA\n\nwork. It promised that it would place in      cl1t-~rge   of the Phase lA project the experlencud senior\n\nmanagt!r who had taken the lead in presenting Zachry's proposal to the J>()).'t Authority.        Zachry\n\nassured tho Port Authority thatthe Port could rely on Zachry as a team          player~   and that Zachry\n\nwould work with the Port in a struightl'orward manner and not engage in any \"claims game.\"\n\n        8.      Regrettably, all of these representations, on which the Port Authority relied,\n\nproved to be    untruE~;   At the   time~   however, persuaded by these representations, the Port\n\nAuthority entered into negotiations with Zachry which culminated in the Phase !A Wharf and\n\nDredging Contract dated Jm1e J, 2004 (the \".(;Qptract\"). Early In !he Project and in response to\n\nthe Port Authority's concerns regarding freez;ing the soil, Zachry a1>surcd the Port that the\n\nfh:ezing would remain far enough awuy from lhe piers that it \\Vould not compromise the \\vharf's\n\nstructural integrity. The Port Aulhodty's concern was well justified; the drllled piers' abillty to\n\fbear weight comes mostly from \"skin friction\" at the itttorface of the soil and pier down the\n\nlength of tim pier~ Freezing tl1e earth near the piers could decrease their load-bearing capacity.\n\nIn addition, the expanded volume of the soil from fn:>eidng could even move, bend, or bret~k the\n\npiers. Zachry, which had a contractual duty to protect the cmnpletcd portions of the wharf\n\ns!ruch1rc while it wus prosecuting its work, promised thut it would maintain at least nine feet\n\nbtSlWt1Cn the frozen soil amlthl;l:;urface of the piers.\n\n        \\1.     The Contract Included two crucial deadlines n.nd stipuli:lled !hat time was of the\n\nessem~e   regarding perforrnance of the Work, The iin~t was Pobmary l, 2006 (u date defined in\n\ntho Contract as thn \"Milestone A\"       date)~   by which Zachry agreed to have one portion of the\n\nwharf fully completed, Tile Port Authority needed that portion of U1e wharf completed by the\n\nMilestone A dnte so that four huge cran<'.S, which were being fabdcated in China and wert} to\n\nardve ln Houston by ship, could be de!lvered and assembled, and rben the cnme operators tndned\n\non the crnncs, in time tbr the completion of the remainder of the wlmrf. The se(.:ond was the\n\n''I1inal Conlplction\" date of June I, 2006. by which the wharf fnoilities nnd dredging work were\n\nto be completely finished,\n\n        10.     At the outset, Zachry fell behind schedule. Among other things, il was late in\n\nmobilizing its on-site work force, submitting its concrcle mix formu!atlon 1 and preparing its\n\nccmcrele butch plant     Th~;t   ::;tart of both ctmcrclc work and the freeze wall   inslallt~tion   were\n\nsignificantly delayed. Further, there was a series of blunders involving the freeze walL Most          or\nthe blunders have their origin in the character and decisions of Zachry's construction manager,\n\nHarold (Andy) Anderson.\n\n          IL    Anderson     wa~   not even a Zachry employee when the Contract was signed.\n\nZnt;hry hired him several weeks later, nftcr a short and hasty search. Although the freeze wall\n\n                                                     4\n\fwus a cen!tn'!)lece of Zachry~s constmction phm, Anderson did not want to use it Rather than\n\nimmediately lnoving forwnrd with the freeze waH, he spem months fi:ultlessly searching for an\n\nnltcmative1 putting the freeze wan behind schedule. He even delayed entering into a subcontract\n\nwith the freeze wall subcontractor whom Zachry had chosen \"\" RKK SoilFreeze Technologies\n\n(\"RKK\"). lnde<:xl 1 Za<~hry .fitially signed the RKK subcontract) and thus freed RKK lo submit a\n\nfi·cezc wall design, only after the date on which Znchty had l>larmed to hove the freeze wall\n\ncompletely installed,\n\n        12.     Anderson compounded his mistakes and delays by compromising Zachry's ability\n\nto properly pcrfonn the freeze wall .installation. F'or example, RKK had spent a substantial\n\namo1n'tt of time working with Fanner Foundation, Zachry's drilling Stlboontractor which was to\n\ninstall both the J)iers and the freeze pipes, to assurttthat Fanner Foundation was acquainted witl1\n\nthe ptt.>eise teehniqua't and tolerunces necessary in plndne, and installing freeze pipes. After all\n\nthis prepumtion work1 Anderson gave the tusk of installing tho freeze pipe to another, cheaper\n\nsub<mntractor. 'l11c replacement subcontractor's wurk was abysmal; it seldom drilled the pipe in\n\nthe location or at the angles specit1ed, and as a consequence the freeze wall design had to be\n\namended to include additional freeze plpt::s to fill in nU!iler011S gar)s. ln another ill,.;arlvised cost\n\nsaving effort, Anderson bought used and dirty freeze pipe inslead of new pipe. Ultimately, after\n\nmuch lime was wasted, approximately 70% of the used pipe was determined to be defective, and\n\nhnd to be replaced,\n\n        13,     In Febmary of 2005 1 havlng concluded that Zachry was behind schedule and in\n\ndanger <>f being unable to satisfy the Mile.'itone A obligation (but having failed to so advise the\n\nPort Authority), Anderson began planning to use a \"cut·off \\VIlli\" running perpendicular from the\n\nfrliez() wall to the land, Under his plan, Zachry would attempt to divid\\fi the pmjeGt in two,. If\n\fwould first excavate beneath the wharf on one side of the cut-off walt, and n:tter so excavating\n\nwould breach the main freeze wall on i'hat side so the ship carrying the cranes COtt!d dock and\n\nunload. Tl1cn 1 Zachry would excavate on the: other side of the cut-off wall to complete the\n\nremnimler ofit!l work.\n\n        14.    Several weeks after Zachry determined that it likely would need a cut~offwall, the\n\nPort Authority advised Zachry that the Pm·t was considering extending the w1mrf's length by 332\n\nfoot Zachry appreciated that the extension would not m.erely be u v.alunble piece of work~ but\n\nalso would offer an opportunfty tu hlivc the Port Authority pay for whatever cut~off wall Zachr)'\n\nultimately would build. Zacl)ry urged the Port Authority not to J)Ut the wharf extension oul Lor\n\nproposals by other conlracwrs, but instead to add the worl<' lo Zaclu·y's Contract. Although it\n\nknJ.>'<V better, Zachry assured the Port that it was on schedule under the 0xisting Contract and\n\ncould build the whttrf extension and still moot. tho Milestone A date.\n\n       15.     On April 5, 2005; Anderson briotly explained a concept !br a cut'-off wall nt n\n\nmeeting with the Port Authority's consultants. He promised that Zachry would soon furnish the\n\nPort Authority with a proposed design forth<:: cut¥ofr \\Vall. Aware of the Port's concem about\n\nlrcozing ncar piers, he promised that freezing was not an issue,\n\n        16.    Atlcr several months of ncgoti ations; dtlring which Zachry continued to provide\n\nthe Port Authority with inaccurate schedules and to give other assurances thai it remained on\n\nschedule1 the parties agreed on the terms of t11e \\vhmf exteusion work ln Change Order 4 to the\n\nContract. The change order, which added approximately SB million to the Contmct price and\n\nextended tim Milestone A date by 15 days~ was approved by the Port Commission in lme July of\n\n2005. The l'ort At1thority prepared the    ~.:hange   ordcw paperwotk .and delivered it to Zachry on\nAugt\\st I0. By then, Zachry already had authorized its       sub(~ontractors   to begin working on the\n\n                                                  6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               r~         11\n                                                                                               ...:::..   ....:4.\n\fextension. Zachry held the cbange order for several weeks ;,vhile it tried to negotiate added\n\nbenefits under the change order. Finally,; on August 29, 2005; Zachry delivered the signed\n\nchange order to the Port A:Uihority.\n\n         11.       lAter, on or about September 12, 2005, Zachry t1nally submitted a draft design for\n\nthe cut~off waiL Like the odginul freeze wall design, the draft cut-off wnU design was prepared\n\nby RKK's engineering        firm~   GeoEngineers. The late delivery dutu of tliis   da~igtt   was another\n\ninstance of inexcusable delay by Zachry. Despite having known since at least Febt·uury that it\n\n\n\ndesign wm: tmdcrway, Zachry waited uutil All gust to autho.rize the de.sig11 work.\n\n         18.       Consistent with Zachry's earlier slate.tntmts that it intended to provide the Pori\n\n\n\nexpre.\"sly invited such review and comment. GeoEngim:crs noted that its desigo            \\Vas   l1Jcrely a\n\ndraft and would be made final only atier GeoBi1gineers incorporated comments fh:nn the Port\n\nAuthority's eommltanis. Zachry's transmittal message underlined this point, stating thar the draft\n\nwas intt:Jnded to give the Port Authority \"the ability to     se~   what   wm be happening and gather\nquestions they might have fbr the engineer.\"\n\n\n\nthe   cuL~on'   wall wmild include freezing in and around the piers to a much greater extent and at\n\ngre<ttter dtsp!hs lhan Zachry had disclosed in discussions in A11dl<             Contrary to Zachry's\n\nrepresentations during the negotiation of Change Order 4, freezing was lndee4 an issue in the\n\nsubmitted design; the design showed freciing at greater depths, and aJ'fecling many more piers,\n\nthan Zachry had represented. The Pmt Authority had no <Jbjection either to the use of a cut-off\n\nwall or to the use offh:eze wall tcc:hnology in the Cl.ltmoffwttlL Howt::ver1 it was concemed about\n\n                                                     7\n\fthe prox irnity of the. freezing to the drilled piers and the resultant risk to the structure. ThUS1 the\n\nPort Authmity responded tn the draft design on October 11, 2005 by noting its concern over the\n\npropnsed freezing near the piers and by instructing Zachry to. ' 1revise and resubmit\" the draft\n\ndesign by presenting either an alten1ative cutoff wall dm;ign or            1u1   \"alternative means of\n\nmitig{tting risk to tho :stnwtural integrity of the wharf.''\n\n        zo.     TJ1e Port Authority delivered its    r~sponse   at an October 11, 2005 meeting at' the\n\nBuyport site. After the Pmt Authority explained its conre!TJ) Andet•son promised that Zachry\n\nwould work with the Port Authority to come up with acceptable desiE:,'TI nmdificaJions. The Port\n\nAutl:J.otity believed Zachry,      GenEnginecrs already had told one of the Port Authority's\n\nconsultants that OeoEnginecrs could easily modily his d<:Sign, or crcnte an alternative design, to\n\naddress the Poresoonccms.\n\n        21.     Within a few weeks, GcoBnginccrs did prepare a ntodlflr~d design whlch, while\n\ncontinuing to use tl'eeze technology, avoided any freezing in rmd among the drilled piers. When\n\nGeol!:nglnecrs showed the modified design to the Port Authority's consultant, he smted that if\n\nZachry !lubmittod the modified deslgrJ, he would npprove it without delay~\n\n        22.     By that point, however, Zachry's mas:·iivo scheduling problems ovetwhe1med all\n\notl1er considerations, including the out-off wall. In earl}t Octohet· of 2005, aficr submission of\n\nthe draft cutoff wall design andprior to the Port Authority's response to the dralt cutoff wall\n\ndesign, Zachry .revealed to the Port Authority that it \\\\tould be 35 days late in meeting the\n\nMilestone A   date~   the very date to which Zachry hod just agreed in Change Order 4. The Port\n\nAuthority, surprised by this revelation, demanded thal Zachry present a schedule recovery plan\n\nin accordance wiih the Contract.\n\f        23.     17oe the first time, Zachry finally began to attempt to detail the ft·eeze wall and\n\ncutoff wall activities in its schedules. It quickly discovered that 35 days late was a gross\n\nunderestimate; in eady November Zachry prepmed detailed schedules (which it concealed from\n\nthe Port Authority) reflecting that Milestone A would not be achieved until Deccn1ber 30, 2006.\n\nAs Zachry further refined its schedules, matters only became worse.              By   mid~Novcmber,\n\nZachry's scheduk1s showed that with a freeze wall, it would not achieve Milestone A until May\n\nof 2007.      Moreover, those schedules predicted it could achieve Milestone A and Final\n\nCompletion much sooner by abandoning the freeze waiL\n\n        24.      When Anderson saw the refined sclmdules, which showed Zachry desperately\n\nbehind schedule, he detennined that the only way Zachry touid hope to have !he wharf prepared\n\nto land the cranes would be to abandon the freeze wall, dig as deeply as possible without a freeze\n\nwall, and then work in the wet. (Even at that, Zachry would not he able to perform all tbe\n\ndredging and excavation required by the Contract as part of the Milestone A work, and \\vould\n\nhave to defer such work until ailer the ctancs were unloaded.) On November l, 2005; Anderson\n\ngave orders to cancel all orders for freeze wall rnatedals and to slowly rernove Zachry personnel\n\n.itom the ii·eeze walt area,\n\n        25.      Amazingly; Anderson did not advise the Port Authority or RKK that he had given\n\nthese inslmctiot1S. instead, he confected lies      to Zachryts management to e>:J)luin why he was\nabandoning    H fi·eeze   wall in vvhich Zachry ttlre.ady had invested some $9 million. He reported to\n\nhJs m1pervisors that chitters .needed to cool the brine that would cin~uLa1e through the freeze pipes\n\nhad been \"commandeered\" hy FEMA in consequence ofHunicum~s Rita and Katrina. He then\n\nattempted to {jnlist RKK in this fraud, mging RKK to report a clliller shmtage so Anderson could\n\nJbrward the false report to the Port Authority. Anderson threatened RKK with financial harm if\n\n                                                     9\n\fattempt to Zachry*s management. Zachry's management, however, never bothered to investi.gate\n\nthis shocking report. To the contrary, Zachry's management continued to rely on Anderson for\n\ninformation about wbat was happening at the l3aypolt job site.\n\n       26,     Appreciating that his lie about commandeered chillers would not find support,\n\nAnderson modified tl1e lie by reporting to Zachry management tbat some chillers were available,\n\nbut not enough to operate the freeze wall adequate1y1 and in consequence the fi·eezing would take\n\nmuch longer thnn planned.\n\n       27.     Anderson also invented n second lie tn Zachry mtmagement: that sheet pile\n\nrequired ibr the alternative cut-off wall de;Jign was unavailable, and would remain unavailable\n\nfor months. Anderson lold this He desnite knowing that the sheet. pile was available for\n\ni:n.unedinte delivery from !ievernl different suppliers; RKK had oonfinned this fuct to Anderson.\n\n       zs.     In making the decision to abandon the freeze wall, Zachry had not prepared any\n\ncost or Cllf:,rincerlng analysis to determine whether its revised conslruclion plan, which Zachry\n\nhas somethncs referred lo as \"Ptan H,jj wus sensible or, indeed, even feasible.          h had not\n\nevaluated whether il1l estimated excavation rales or o!htlf production rat(}s were realistic. It had\n\nnot determined how it would excavate bem7nth the wharf deck. It had not dctem1ined how\n\ndeeply it could snfely excavate with an unfi·ozen berm. H hod not addressed the problems\n\ncreated by u,roundwater infiltration. It had$ in short, nq reliable way of evaluating the time\n\nrequired fbr, tlm costs entailed by, or tl1e risks and benefils of Plan B, and no rcHable way of\n\nc.ompadng the time, costs, risks, and benetits of Plana with those of the freeze walL\n\n       29.     Representatives of Zachry nml the Port Authority had n series of meetings and\n\nphone conversations in October, Novernber, nm1 December of 2005 to discuss the scheduling\n\n                                                 !Q\n\fissues. Zut1hry told the Port that it had detem1ined to abandon the main freeze wan because it\n\nwas out of time to implement the freeze wall and stilt meet the contractually required completion\n\ndates for Milestone A and Final Completion. Zachry told the Port Authority that more water was\n\nflowing fhnn tl1e land side than Zachry had anticipated and that it could not freeze the soil\n\nquieldy enough,        Zachry suid its schedules     show~d   thttt abandoning the freeze Viall and\n\nproceeding instead \\\\1th Plan 13 ·-working in the dry behind a n\\>tv11~ozen berm to a certfti n depth\n\nand   lh~m   working ln the wet thet'eailcr •w would result iu the earliest practicable achievement of\n\nthe Miles.tnne A and Final Completion dates.\n\n        30.       At no point during any of the many rneetings or convenmtions .in late 2005 did\n\nZ.n:chty ever sta.tc or even suggest, as it much later would clairn ln this lawsuit~ that its decision to\n\nabandon tho freeze     Wti!l \\VM   connected with any supposed 1'rejection\" of the draft cut:..offwall\n\ndesign, as Zachry now ctairns in this lawsuit .Zachry made no sucl1 rmggestion because the\n\ntnodificalions thnt the Pott Authority requested to the submittal of the draft design played no role\n\nin Znchry;s decision to abandon the frcczo Wtill.\n\n        :l l.     Bad Zachry asserted in any of the coiwersations in late :wos, a.'! it later would in\n\nthis lawsuit, that it was abandoning the ti:ee%e wall as a result of the Port Authority•s i'evise and\n\nresubmit rc._<;ponse to the dmfl cut~off waH design submittal, that abandonment .of the freeze wall\n\n\\vas going to del11y Zachry's completkm of the project and increase Zachry's cost tb complefe1\n\nand thut the Port was somehow responsible for the resulliog delay and increased costs to Zachry,\n\nthen there is no doubt that the entire tenol' of those cmwersnHonN would have chtmgcd~ and that\n\nthe Ptwt Authority promptly would have, at a minimum. instructed Zachry to delete the '''harf'\n\nexlensitm from the scope of ils work under the Contract\n\f                32.     Zachry's planning, estimating1 and execution have proved to be no better since it\n\n         abandoned the fi·eeze waH tl1au before it did so. Through no fault of the Port Authority! Zacluy\n\n         failed to execute the work in accordance with any of the numerous schedules it prepared for\n\n         complc!lng the project using the Plan B construction method. Zacht'y did not dec!u:ro final\n\n         completion of its work until January of2009.\n\n                33.     Unbeknownst to the Port Authority, the \"Zachry\" entity with \\Yhich the Port\n\n         Authority contractt1d apparently Cklased perfom1ing the Work on the Contract. Instead. Zacluy\n\n         ch1mged its nmne and Zachry's parent company created a       new comp!l.nY to assume Zachry's\n                                                                                          \"\n         name - lhc name Zachry Constmction Corporation.           In lnte 2007 r Zachry asked the Pmt\n\n         Authority for its oonsent to an assignment of the Contract The Port Authority responded that it\n\n         would consent to the assignment upon satisfttction by Z11chry of several reasonable conditions.\n\n         Zachry di.d nm agree to or satisfy the conditions. In fact, Zachry ignmed the Por! Authority's\n\n         response.    Instead of respondit1g to the Port Authority or satisfying the conditions, on\n\n         infbrmntkm and belief., on January 1, 2008 and without knowledge of the Port Authority, the nmv\n\n         company apparently began pertbrming Zac1ny's CJbligutions ~mdcr tl1e Contract. Zachry assigned\n\n         its obligations under the Contract to the new company in breach o:f Section 3.13, apparently\n\n         ceased to employ   OJHiite   supervision in breacll of Section 5J 61 and apparently ceased self-\n\n         peribrming the Work and engaged a subc~)ntractor not disclosed to the Port Authority in breach\n\n         oJ Scclion 5.11 of the General Conditions.\n\n                34.     Apparently, the new company (which did uot have u contract wit11 the Port\n\ni.f\"\".   Authority but had assumed the name of Znchry) with Zachry's knowledge and at Zachry's\n\n         instruction submitted invoices for Work and signed releases to induce the Port Authority to make\n\n         payment. Zachry thereafter represented to the Port Authority that the claims in this titigntion\n\n                                                         12\n\fw<:r(: Zachry's claims and that all cost.'l which it sought as damages were incurred by Zachry,\n\nEven Zachry's damages documentation- disclosed to the Port Authority only after order of the\n\nCow·t -· states that all costs were incurred by Zachry.

In addition, Z,achry failed to properly perform Work and\n\nthe Port Autlmdty had to puy another contractor to correct or mitigate harm caused by Ztwl1ry's\n\ndefective Work.

(Each of these objections, individually or collectively, \"Beyond the\n      Rules.\"). The P01t of Houston specifically objects to Interrogatory 1\\o. I us Vague with respect to\n      the term \"vn!ue, and the phrase \"in regards to performance of the Contract.\"\n\n      The Port of Houston objects to the defmition of \"Zachry\" set forth in puragraph 2 of Plaintiffs\n      Fourth Set of interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the Port of Houston as\n      Vague, because the tem1 is defined in relevant part as meaning \"Zachry Construction\n      Corporation\", a name in fact used by more than one company that was involved on the Project:\n      one is the Port of Houston's counterparty as named, defined and agreed upon in the Bayport\n«\"I   Tenninal Complex Phase 1A V./harl' & Dredging Contract; at least one other is not. furthermore,\nc\n      the Port of Houston understands that the correct name of Plaintiff is now Zachry Industrial, lnc.\n      Il appears that the entity formerly known as \"Zachry Construction Corporation\" engaged in\n      transactions such that it no longer performed the Work under the Phase lA Wharf and Dredging\n      Contract, without the prior knowledge of the Port of Houston and in breach of the Contract. The\n      Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"Zachry\" to the extent that it suggests thut the Port of\n      Houston has a contract for the work under the Phase l A Wharf & Dredging Contract with any\n      entiry other than the entity that originally executed the Ph.lA vVharf & Dredging Contract as the\n      \"Contractor.\" The Port of Houston, by its use of the te1m \"Zachry'' in these objections and\n      responses, refers to the entity that is the \"Contractor\" under the Phase IA Wharl' & Dredging\n      Contract.\n\n\n                                                        2\n\f      The Po11 of Houston objects to the definition of \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\" and\n      each and every interrogatory that includes the tenn \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\"\n      to the extent that Zachry intends for the tenn ''Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\" to\n      mean that tl1e Bayport Terminal Complex Phase lA Wharf and Dredging Contract includes a\n      greater scope of work or authority or discretion for Zachry than, in fact, it does. For example,\n      Zachry's definition states thal the contract is for the \"d~ign, construction and procurement\" of a\n      wharf facility, but, in fact, the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract is not a design build\n      contract or 'm engineer, procure and construct contract as implied by the definition. Zachry's\n      scope of work is set forth in the Phase IA Wharf and Dredging Contract and the Pot1 of Houston\n      will respond in accordance with the actual scope of the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.\n\n      The Port of Houston further objects to the interrogatories to the extent they would require\n      information protected or exempted from discovery by any applicable privilege or immunity. In\n      all instances, the Port of Houston intends to preserve and claim, where applicable, the\n      attomey/client privilege, the work product immunity, the common interest privilege, the\n      consulting expert privilege, the executive session privilege pursuant to Sections 551.104 and\n      551.146, Texas Government Code, of the Texas Open Meetings Act, the maritime security\n      privilege pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114 and 49 C.F.R. pt. 1520, and any other privilege, immunity or\n      other legal ptinciple or rule that protects or exempts from disclosure documents or other\n      information requcgted by the Plaintiff.\n\n      Pursuant to Texas RuleofCivil Procedure 197.1 and its comment no. I, parts (i) and (vii) ofthe\n      interrogatories are expressly objected to to the extent that the interrogatories \\vould require the\n      Port of Houston to state all of its factual assertions about its subject matter. 111e Port of Houston\n      assumes that in propounding the interrogatories, Zachry is not asking the Port of Houston to\n      marshal the evidence with respect to the subject matters addressed by the interrogatory and the\n      Port of Houston, pursuant to Texas Rule of Procedure 197.1 and its comment no. 1, objects to\n      any request or demand by Zachry that the P011 of Houston so marshal.\n\n      Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 197 .2(c), to the extent the answer to the\n      inte1Togat.ories may be derived or ascertained tlum the Pmt of Houston's business records that\n      httve been or will be produced in this case, the Port of Houston objects on the basis that the\n      burden for deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the Port of Houston\n      as it is for Zachry.\n\n      Subject to its objections and based on the stated assumptions, the Port of Houston answers\nC'l   Zachry's Fourth Set of Interrogatories as follows:\n\n              Under the Contract, Zachry was required to complete Area A by February 15, 2006 and\n      the entirety of tlle Work by July 15, 2006. Both deadlines were subsequently extended 9 days\n      for Hunicane Rita. Zachry failed to meet either deadline. Zachry did not declare completion of\n      the Work under the Contract until January of 2009 and continued to work on Area A unlit that\n      time. The Work, however, still is not complete, a point of discussion between the pat1ies.\n\n             The Port of Houston does not know the universe of work that may not have been properly\n      performed by Zachry or the universe of Zachry's failure to comply with the Contract. Jvloreover,\n      Zachry has continuing warranty obligations that apply to any work that was not properly\n\n\n                                                        3\n\f        performed by Zachry and the Port of Houston expects that Zachry will comply with such\n        obligations. The Port of Houston's knowledge of deficient Work by Zachry, however, includes\n        deficient crane ruil installation, deficiencies in the fender coatings, deficiencies in the pavement\n        striping, deficient dust plan, and deficiencies in advanced cruise dredging. Furthermore, the Port\n        of Houston has been har-med by Zachry's failure to pay for overtime inspections and the Port of\n        Houston's various concessions in an effort to facilitate Zachry's completion of the work. These\n        concessions include agreeing to allow Zachry to install fabric fonned revetment in lieu of the\n        articulated block mat Zachry was contractually required to install. In addition, the Port of\n        Houston incurred significant costs in evaluating proposals from Zachry in Zachry's effort to\n        provide the Port of Houston with less than it had agreed to provide, such as Zachry's proposal to\n        revise the l.mder wharf slope.\n\n                The Port of Houston cannot know the precise nature and extent of damages caused by\n        Zachry's failure to timely meet the Milestone A deadline, failure to timely complete the Project,\n        failures to properly perfonn the Work, and fi·aud. In addition to the readily quantifiable harm\n        Zachry caust:d the Port of Houston, Zachry hunncd the Port of Houston in ways thut are very\n        difficult to quantify.\n\n                Subject to the foregoing, the estimated costs associated with the above identiiled known\n        deficiencies in Zachry's Work include the following:\n\n                    •   Cost to correct defective fender coating: estimated as S509,312.48\n\n                    •   Co~>t   to install fenders: estimated as $478,450.00\n\n                    •   l'ailure to complete clearing and grubbing on the South side of Port Road:\n                        $25,200.00 (to be deducted from amounts due Zachry per agreement with Zachry)\n\n                    •   Deficient crane rail installation: inspection cost S7,460.00; future cost unknown at\n                        this time\n\n                    •   Defective striping: approximately $180,000.00\n\n                    o   Deficient dust plan: approximately $10,000.00\n\n                    •   Cost for Work outside of normal hours: at least $73,536.22\nC'l\n                    •   Investigate means of removing soil from under wbatf deck: at least $24,900.00\n\n'<J\n                    •   Cost to evaluate fabric fonned revetment: at least $30,246.77\n :;[}\n :c\nc..\n                    o   Decrease in cost to Zachry for substitution of fabric f01med revetment: at least\n                        $450,000.00\n\n                    •   Jncrea<;e in cost to Port of Houston for maintenance of fabric fonned revetment:\n ij\n                        Not yet dctennined\n.:::.\n\nz-                  •   Cost to evaluaL~ altemrnive anchor design: at least $7,500.00\n\n                                                            4\n\f                 •    Cost to evaluate elimination of revetment: at least $20,170.73\n\n                 •    Cost to evaluate various under wharf deck slopes: at least $245,491 .58\n\n                 •    Cost to inspect and review proposed repair of defective drilled shafts: at least\n                      $26,195.00\n\n             With respect to Zachry's defective dredging under Change Order ;\\o. I to the Contract,\n      i.e. the \"advanced cruise dredging\" work, Zachry dredged outside of the dredge profile of the\n      Contract, destabiJizing the adjacent shoreline and altering the condition of the site as advertised\n      in hid proposal documents for the Cmise Wharf and Dredging Contract. Zachry's failures\n      necessitated the Port of Houston having the contractor of the Cruise Wharf and Dredging\n      Contract, Orion, mitigate and repair the hann caused by Zachry, The amount of such payments\n      to Orion is $600,000.00.\n\n              Tho Port of Houston's harm due to Zachry's failure to timely complete Milestone A and\n      the entire Project includes, without limitation, additional progrrun management consuJtant and\n      engineering fees, additional time spent and resources devoted by the Pmt of Houston's\n      engineering department, lost business, and loss of use of construction materials. The difficulty\n      of quantifying and proving such actual damages is one of the reasons the purties agreed to the\n      Contract price reduction and liquidated damages provisions in the Contract. The full amount of\n      harm caused by the delay is unknown.\n\n              Subject to the foregoing, the Port of Houston incurred at least the following additional\n      costs for additional consultant services perfmmed through January 2009 as a result of Zachry's\n      failure to timely complete the work:\n\n                 •    $46,970.85 for Geotest;\n\n                 •    $1,118,953.24forCH2MHill;\n\n                 •    $130,750.00 for Overlond Assessments; and\n\n                  •   $74,617.29torDMJ!vl\n\n              In addition, the Port of Houston paid $172,871.82 to Paradigm for services after July\n      2006 in connection with both the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging l>roject and the Container Yard\nC'l\n      project. A portion, which can be detennined from the documents produced in discovery, is\n      associated with the Zachry caused delay on the Phase l A Wharf & Dredging Project.\n\n             Zachry also caused the Port of Houston's engineering department to expend ao additional\n      approximately 3,299 man hours on the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Project from August 2006\n      through Junuary 2009, which represents an expense to the Port of Houston of $220,044.98.\n      Other Port of Houston personnel were required to expend additional time on the Phase I A \\Vharf\n      & Dredging Project as well, but do not keep track of their time, so a readily quantifiable amount\n      representing the additional increased expense to the Port of Houston on the Phase lA Wharf &\n      Uredging for their time is not cummtly available.\n\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f              In addition to the additional expense incurred on the Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Project\n      for extended personnel time, the time spent by the Port of Houston personnel on the Phase l A\n      Wharf & Dredging Project during this time period would have been spent on other projects,\n      resulting in additional losses to the Port of Houston. These losses of are difficult to quantify.\n\n             Zachry's failure to timely complete the Work of the on the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging\n      Project precluded Porl of Houston customers from using the Bayport Tenninal Complex as soon\n      as they otherwise could have. The steamship lines that moved from Barbours Cut Terminal to\n      Bayport collectively increased container volume from 77,586 vessel lifts in 2006 to 102,413\n      vessel lifls in 2007 (an increase of 32%). At the same time, steamship lines remaining at\n      Barbours Cul Tenninal filled the void left by the relocation of can·iers to Bayport, and Barbours\n      Cut Terminal <:ontainerizt::d cargo still incn::ttsed by 3% over the previous year. The Port of\n      Houston believes that the same full capacity use would have occurred if the wharf had opened on\n      time in July 2006. Thus, the Port of Houston lost over six months of cargo resulting in an\n      estimated $620,000 decrease in revenue as a result of late completion of the entirety of the work.\n      In addition, when the first customer began using Bayport, the customer leased a portion of the\n      container yard. The Port of Houston believes that it would have leased tht:: container yard earlier\n      had the project been completed on time in July 2006, resulting in a loss of lease revenue of\n      $210,000.\n\n               BC(;ause Zachry did not complete the dredging in a timely manner using mechanical\n      means, Zachry was allO\\'led to utilize hydraulic dredging in the fall of 2006, after the project\n      completion deadline, to complete the dredging so that the Port of Houston could utilize the\n      facility upon Zachry's sufficient completion of a portion of the wharf (albeit still incomplete).\n      The estimated h<mn to the P011 of Houston as a result of Zuchry's use of hydraulic drt::dging due\n      to its failure to complete the dredging within the contract time is ut least $2,500,000. The harm\n      includes U1e cost to manage the hydraulic dredge material and close the hydraulic dredge ponds\n      to prepare for future constn.1ction.\n\n              Moreover, Zachry's failure to timely dredge material from the Bayport channel and to\n      excavate material from beneath the wharf deck deprived the Port of Houston of the opportunity\n      to have the matetials available as fill as soon as the materials should have been for usc on other\n      projects. Thus, fill material that should have been provided from one or both of such sources,\n      because of Zachry's delays, had to be obtained from borrow pits at an estimated cost of\n      $470,000.\n\nC'l          The full amount of the harm to the Port of Houston as a result of Zachry's failure to\n      timely meet the Milestone A deadline, failure to timely complete the Project, and failures to\n      properly perform the Worl< is difficult to quantify. The Port of Houston has suffered at least\n      $8,079,799 in quantifiable damages, but the total hmm to the Port of Houston is higher.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       6\n\f                                    REQUESTS FOR PRODUCI'ION\n\n      GENERAL 0BJEGI'IONS TO R EQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION:\n\n      With respect to Zachry's Fourth Request for Production, the Port of Houston hereby objects as\n      follows:               ·\n\n      1.      The Port of llouston objects to each and every request to the extent that such request\n      would requjre infonnation protected or exempted from discovery by any applicable privilege or\n      immunity. In all instances, the Port of Houston intends to preserve and claim, where applicable,\n      th~ uttomey/clitmt privilege, the work product immunity, the common interest p1ivi!ege, the\n      consulting expert p1ivilege, the executive session privilege pursuant to Sections 551.104 and\n      55 1.146, Texas Government Code, of the Texas Open Meetings Act, the maritime security\n      privilege pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114 and 49 C.F.R, pt. 1520, and any other privilege, immunity or\n      other legal principle or rule that protects or exempts from disclosure documents or other\n      information requested by the Plaintiff.

The Port of Houston objects to each and every request to U1e extent that it is vague\n      (\"Vague\"), unduly burdensome (\"Unduly Burdensome\"), overly broad (\"Overly Broad\") or\n      seeks to impose obligations or burdens on the Port of Houston beyond those imposed by the\n      Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, including without limitation the Rules of Civil Procedure\n      applicable to discovery of magnetic or electronic data (each of these objections, individually or\n      collectively, \"Beyond the Rules.\")\n\n      3.      The Pmt of 1-touston objects to the definition of ''Zachry\" set forth in paragraph 2 of\n      Plaintiff's Fourth Set nf Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the Port of\n      Huustun as Vague, because the term is defined in relevant patt as meaning \"Zachry Constn1cUon\n      Corporation\", a name in fact used by more than one company that was involved on the Project:\n      one is the Port of Houston's counter-party as named, defined and agreed upon in the Bayport\n      Te1minal Complex Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Contract; nt least one other is not. Furthennore,\n      tJ1e P011 of Houston understands that the corret:l m1me of Plaintiff is now Zachry Industrial, Inc.\n      lt appears that the entity formerly known as \"Zachry Constn1ction Corporation\" engaged in\n      transactions such that it no longer perfonned the Work lmdcr the Phase lA Wbarf & Dredging\n      Contract, without the prior knowledge of the Port of Houston and in breHch of the Contract. The\n      P011 ofHouston objects to the definition of\"Zachry\" to the extent that it suggests that the Port of\nC'l\n      Houston has a contract for the work under the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Contract with any\n      entity other than the entity that originally executed the Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Contract as\n      the \"Contractor.\" The Port of Houston, by its use of the tenn \"Zachry\" in these objections, refers\n      to the entity that is the \"Contractor\" under the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Contract.\n\n      4.     The Pott of Houston objects to the definition of \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" and each and every request that includes the tenn \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" to the extent that Zachry intends for the term \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" to mean that the Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n      includes a greater scope of work or authority or discretion for Zt~chry than, in tact, it does. For\n      example, Zachry's definition states thnt the contract is for the \"design, construction and\nz\n\n                                                       7\n\f       procurement\" of a wharf facility, but, in fact, the Phase lA Wharf and Dredging Contract is not a\n       design bui1d contract or an engineer, procure and construct contracl as implied by the definition.\n       Zachry's scope of work is set forth in the Phase IA Vv'harfand Dredging Contract and the Port of\n       Houston will respond in accordance with the actual scope of the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging\n       Contract The foregoing objection is referred to below as \"Contract.\"\n\n       5.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaint(ffs Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production to the extent that the definition (i) inaccurately characterizes or seeks to\n       expand Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(b), (ii) could be construed to require the Port ofHouston to locate\n       or produce doctm1ents no longer in its possession, custody, or control, (iii) would result in any\n       obligation or burden that is Beyond the Rules, and (iv) calls for documents that can be obtained\n       from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive than\n       demanding these documents from the Port of Houston.\n\n       G.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production as Unreasonably Burdensome, duplicative, Vague and Beyond the Rules\n       to the extent that the definition could be construed to require the Porl of Houston to produce both\n       paper and electronic versions of the same identical document, notwithstanding use of the term\n       \"non-identical\" in the definition.\n\n       7.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production and the phruse \"care, custody or control\" as used therein to the extent-\n       PlaintifT seeks to expand the scope of the Port of Houston's obligation to produce documents\n       beyond Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(b) and 192.7(b) or thut is othen.vise Beyond the Rules.\n\n       8.     The Port of Houston objects to paragraph ll under the Definitions and Instructions\n       heading of Plaint(ff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to require a privilege Jog that is Beyond the Rules or to reqtJirc the Port of\n       Houston to provide a privilege log sooner than required by the Texas Rules of Civjl Procedure.\n\n       9.     The Port of Houston objects to paragraph 12 under the Definitions and Instructions\n       heading of Plaint!ffs Fourth Set of interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to impose obligations upon the Port of Houston that are Beyond the Rules,\nC\"'l   including without limitation obligations in excess of those imposed by Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.4.\n\n       l 0.    Tbe Port of Houston objects to paragraph 13 under the Definitions and Instmctions\n       heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to impose obligations upon the Port of Houston that are Beyond the Rules.\n\n       11.     The Port of Houston objects to Zachry's Fourth Requests for Production as duplicative\n       (''Duplicative\").\n\n\n\n\n                                                        8\n\f     12.

THIESS: Okay. Anyone have other\n8    issues with the wharf?\n9                   MR. ANDERSON: Yeah I have two items I\n10 want to bring up. We need to get like an official okay\n11 about bringing this ship in on the west end of the\n12 wharf. We have talked about it. We put it in, I think\n13 the last time Mark was going to look at whether or not\n14 there was a conflict with the electrical service that\n15 went to the west. We haven't heard back. We've always\n16 been - - since the beginning, we've been moving on the\n17 basis that the ship would come in on the west end\n18 rather than the east.\n19                  MR. ELY: You're talking about the barge\n20 to unload the cranes?\n21                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah.\n22                  MR. ELY: Okay.\n23                  MR. THIESS: Now, with this new potential\n24 section it's really critical.\n25                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah with the 330-foot\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0002\n\f                                                               3\n1    extension, it now almost mandates that the ship come in\n2    on the west end. So we need to get something concrete\n3    from the Port that says it's okay. Because under the\n4    contract, I'm required to give you the east end. I just\n5    need to get that clarified.\n6                   MR. THIESS: I think the best way would\n7    be to get an RFI in and get it on the clock.\n8                   MR. ANDERSON: I think - did we not put\n9    one in already?\n10                  MR. ROGERS: No. We were - -\n11                  MR. ANDERSON: I know we were talking\n12 about doing it. All right. Let's get one in and let's\n13 put some verbiage in it about the fact that with this\n14 upcoming 330-foot extension it mandates that the ship\n15 come in on the west end. The last - if I remember the\n16 conversation the last time, I think even Mark said that\n17 even if they unloaded at the west end it still wasn't\n18 an issue because if they had to move the crane, they\n19 could always tow it -\n20                  MR. GLASGOW: Tow it down.\n21                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, they could always\n22 tow it wherever they needed to go. And from what I\n23 understand, once the cranes are on the track, it's just\n24 a commissioning issue. So they really don't have to\n25 move anywhere. And so that's the - - that's the big.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0003\n\f                                                                  4\n1                   issue that I have, is getting that\n2    clarified.\n3                   MR. THIESS: Okay.\n4                   MR. ELY: Hang on just a second. If we\n5    did that, if we pushed all the cranes - - how many cranes\n6    are we getting, four?\n7                   MR. THIESS: Four.\n8                    MR. ELY: If we pushed all of the cranes\n9    over to the west side, would we be able to hook up\n10 temporary power to do the commissioning?\n11                   MR. ANDERSON: Oh, I would think so.\n12                   MR. ELY: Okay. Because I think that's\n13 probably the only issue, right? Because the cables are\n14 not going to reach that far. And so if we could run\n15 just a temporary conduit across the deck, and I can get\n16 power to the cranes, then I don't see any issue.\n17                   MR. ANDERSON: I don't see that being a\n18 problem. We've come up with a design that we'll be\n19 proposing to you guys on the freeze wall, where - - you\n20 know, in this 330-foot extension, we are going to\n21 design in a cutoff wall that will allow us to reach the\n22 freeze wall and open 900 feet of it up while we\n23 continue to work towards the east end. All right.\n24                There,is one upcoming issue that we are going\n25 to have that we have - we believe we have found a\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0004\n\f                                                                5\n1    solution to. We'll probably, once we finalize it, we'll\n2    give it to you formal, but you may as well know about it\n3    now.\n4               There is - - the cutoff wall involves a sheet\n5    pile bin wall structure being built about 8 feet wide\n6    that the soil between the bin walls will be frozen. This\n7    encompasses one B row piling right in the middle of it.\n8    Now, the freezing is not the issue, because the pile\n9    goes 40 feed deep or 50 feet deeper than the soil\n10 that's being frozen - -\n11                  MR. THIESS: Andy, I'm sorry. One thing\n12 with that - - how deep is the wall?\n13                  MR. ANDERSON: About 100 feet.\n14                  MR. THIESS: How deep is the pile?\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, actually, it's 90\n16 feet below zero, so 90 feet cuz elevation's plus 10 at\n17 the top.\n18                  MR. THIESS: And the B row pile is --\n19                  MR. ANDERSON: About 130.\n20                  MR. THIESS: Okay. So it's about 30 feet\n21 below --\n22                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, there's 30 or 40\n23 feet of piling below the freezing matrix.\n24                  MR. THIESS: Yeah, but you still have\n25 about 40 or 50 feet of affected skin friction of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0005\n\f                                                                6\n1    pile?\n2                   MR. ANDERSON: Yes.\n3                   MR. THIESS: All right.\n4                   MR. ANDERSON: Now, but that's not the --\n5    that's not our concern. The biggest concern is that in\n6    the excavation process, eventually they're going to have\n7    unequal pressure against that bin wall because we are\n8    going to remove it on one side and you're to have the\n9    dirt pushing on it. And then eventually it's going to\n10 be\n11 reversed. You're going to have water and air on the\n12 other side. So there is a deflection in this - - in\n13 this bin wall. And first blush says that the deflection\n14 will be somewhere in the vicinity of 4 to 6 inches.\n15              That was only done it based on a\n16 two-dimensional model, so they are - - right now they\n17 have new software we're programming on a\n18 three-dimensional model to see if we can get a more\n19 accurate look at the deflection.\n20              The idea that we're using is that that one\n21 specific pile will be drilled and cased to probably 42\n22 or 48 inches, and then we'll establish a casing at 36\n23 inches, in the middle of this secondary casing. That\n24 will allow this casing to deflect with the wall and not\n25 put any lateral pressure against the piling. Our\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0006\n\f                                                               7\n1    biggest concern is not the freezing, it's the lateral\n2    pressure - -\n3                   MR. THIESS: Preloading - -\n4                   MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, preloading the pile.\n5    And - - but I think that that, you know, I think that\n6    that will solve the problem. I am fairly comfortable\n7    with what I saw, if we can keep the movement contained\n8    within that secondary casing, we should be okay.\n9                   MR. FARHAT: Do you have a sketch of what\n10 you are talking about?\n11                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, I can draw it on the\n12 board for you if you want to see it.\n13                  MR. ELY: How low would the casing go\n14 down?\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: The casing is - - the 42\n16 inch will go down as - - probably as deep as the - - what\n17 do you call it - - how deep do we want?\n18                  MR. ELY: Would it go all the way to the\n19 bottom of the sheet pile? Probably not, right?\n20                  MR. ANDERSON: No, it doesn't have to go\n21 that deep.\n22                  MR. ELY: Right.\n23                  MR. ANDERSON: And that has to be - - and\n24 obviously, once the --\n25                  MR. ELY: See that's a design mod\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0007\n\f                                                                8\n1    basically. Is that what you're saying? Right?\n2                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah. And what we'll do\n3    is, when it comes time to remove it, divers are going to\n4    have to go down and cut the casing off the outer\n5    casing.\n6                  MR. ELY: You can't pull it, you mean?\n7                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, see, no, we can't\n8    because we're continuing to build the deck over this - -\n9                  MR. ELY: Oh, you're going to leave it in\n10 place?\n11                 MR. ANDERSON: Yes.\n12                 MR. ELY: Oh, I see.\n13                 MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, it's - - we intend - -\n14 this cutoff wall is being designed in such a fashion\n15 that we're still going to be able to build the subdeck\n16 while the freeze wall stands there.\n17                 MR. ELY: I gotcha.\n18                 MR. ANDERSON: So even that freeze wall,\n19 what we are going to do is when it comes time to do the\n20 excavation, we'll do all of the excavation that we need\n21 to do on it. And then eventually, divers are going to\n22 go down and they are going to cut through the sheeting\n23 off-\n24                 MR. ELY: (Inaudible) or whatever.\n25                 MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, a couple of feet\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0008\n\f                                                               9\n1    below the mud line, and we're going to cut the sheeting\n2    wall down. All right. And then in that, we're then\n3    going to cut the outer casing of the pile and be right\n4    back to what we need.\n5                   MR. ELY: Could you back fill that casing\n6    with some kind of hard material that - -\n7                   MR. ANDERSON: Sure. I mean, we --\n8                   MR. ELY: Lean concrete or something.\n9                   MR. ANDERSON: I was going to say we can\n10 pour - - we can pour concrete in the casing for all that\n11 matters, in order to fill that void up. That would be\n12 a no-brainer. We could easily do that.\n13                  MR. ELY: Okay. That's something our\n14 Geotech will have to look at.\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: And we're not done on the\n16 calculations, but I wanted to give you a head's-up.\n17 Jerry, did you want me to show you what it - -\n18                  MR. FARHAT: Okay. Maybe --\n19                  MR. ANDERSON: - - what we're going to do\n20 is this (inaudible). We're looking at if this is the\n21 freeze wall here, and we have the wharf face here, and\n22 of course we have the piles here, and then we have B\n23 row that sits in through here. All right. The bin\n24 wall that we're talking about building is actually\n25 shaped about like this, and runs all the way back to H\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0009\n\f                                                                   10\n1    row, all right, and cut off here. What this does is,\n2    this ties up into the freeze wall in this fashion which\n3    gives it its stability.\n4                 This is the piling that is in question right\n5    here. And what we want to do is, we want to put an\n6    outer casing around that piling to allow this bin wall\n7    to deflect as as needed. Because eventually, when this\n8    is all excavated out, of course you've got this - -\n9    you've got soil - - the worst case is when we've\n10 excavated this side, and you haven't excavated this\n11 side, and you have all this pressure of the soil laying\n12 against this bin wall.\n13                All right. So this whole thing is going to be\n14 frozen, along with this. Eventually, what we would have\n15 here is in the slope matrix, you've got the B row piling\n16 that goes down here with the deck up above it. The\n17 sheathing is going to be installed in the freeze wall at\n18 this level. It's going to be well under the deck by\n19 several feet. And this casing will more than likely\n20 come into play in here, just enough depth to be able to\n21 protect it from the deflection. Because once we get\n22 into the soil, the bin wall is not going to move.\n23                You know, once you get into the soil, the soil\n24 is going to act as shoring to hold it in place anyway.\n25 The deflection is going to occur primarily at close to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        0008.0010\n\f                                                                 11\n1    the top.\n2                  MR. FARHAT: Do you have only one bin\n3    wall or just so many of them?\n4                  MR. ANDERSON: Just one. All this is is\n5    that in the complete matrix of the freeze wall what\n6    we've done now - - it used to be that the freeze wall was\n7    going to end at this point. But now, with this 330-foot\n8    extension, it's going to be extended out. Under our\n9    current schedule, we have to finish the entire subdeck\n10 before I can breach the freeze wall to bring the ship\n11 in. It doesn't work if I got another three or four\n12 months' worth of work. So at about - - at about the 900\n13 foot mark, at this point, we are going to put the cutoff\n14 wall so that I can take this freeze wall out when\n15 necessary, whenever we're there.\n16                 MR. McKENNEY: You're going to drive that\n17 casing in first and then drill it in?\n18                 MR. ANDERSON: Well, I think we'll drive\n19 _.. we're probably gonna end up drilling it.\n20                 MR. ELY: No, we can't drive it. Our\n21 permit doesn't allow it.\n22                 MR. ANDERSON: No, we can drive it.\n23                 MR. ELY: You can?\n24                 MR. ANDERSON: There's nothing in the\n25 permit that says I can't drive it .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0011\n\f                                                                12\n1                  MR. ELY: Really? Okay.\n2                  MR. ANDERSON: In fact, the sheeting - -\n3    it's about two days' worth of work to drive the\n4    sheeting, so there's going to be a myriad of phone calls\n5    and complaints and bitches while we are doing this for\n6    two days. And then you guys can yell at me and slap my\n7    hand and say bad contractor, and I say, okay, we won't\n8    do it anymore. But - -\n9                  MR. THIESS: Well, the only thing is, I\n10 remember when the GeoEngineers were talking about this\n11 at the Port, they said that they might lose like 5 to 10\n12 percent shear strength on the soil. So we might\n13 just have to make that B row pile a little deeper, huh?\n14                 MR. ELY: There's going to be - - some\n15 more discussion is going to occur, because the testing\n16 that they've done shows there's no degradation after\n17 that cycle.\n18                 MR. THIESS: Oh, really?\n19                 MR. ELY: But, you know, nobody is sure\n20 if they believe that yet, so...\n21                 MR. ANDERSON: Okay. One of the things\n22 we had talked about is taking that one particular piling\n23 another 10, 20 feet deeper in order to pick up that skin\n24 friction. And if that's what it's going to take for you\n25 guys to get comfortable with it, I have no problem,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     0008.0012\n\f                                                               13\n1    we'll take it down another 20 feet, you know, just to\n2    get it. How much end bearings do you have on these\n3    pilings? What percentage of end bearings on it?\n4                   MR. FARHAT: Oh, I don't know. They may\n5    be 40 percent end bearing. I have to check.\n6                   MR. ANDERSON: Because, you know, as we\n7    Get deeper in there, that soil becomes much, much more\n8    stable, and you're going to pick up some additional end\n9    bearing if I take it another 20, 30 feet, plus the\n10 additional skin friction. Okay? So I just - - like I\n11 said, this is just the first blush to give you an idea\n12 of what's coming when we give you the - - when we get\n13 this pricing together for the 330-footer, that - -\n14                  MR. THIESS: It's going to include that.\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: - - it's going to include\n16 the cost of this. RKK is already working on the\n17 engineering calculations and stuff to be able to make\n18 sure that we're not - - that this piling is not going to\n19 cause us a problem. All right.\n20                  MR. THIESS: So what we will have is\n21 stamped engineering on that pile.\n22                  MR. ANDERSON: Yes, yes.\n23                  MR. THIESS: Okay.\n24                  MR. McKENNEY: If he drills that in\n25 there, how's Bobby gonna have - - is he going to still\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0013\n\f                                                                   14\n1    have a 36 inch shaft?\n2                       MR. ANDERSON: He's going to set another\n3    casing inside the - - yes. It will be a double-cased\n4    pile.\n5                       MR. ELY: Just make sure when they do\n6    that, when they do the analysis, make sure they include\n7    the stiffness of the shaft - -\n8                       MR. ANDERSON: Okay.\n9                       MR. ELY: Because I mean, a lot of times\n10 what people will do is, they go down and say, oh, the\n11 deflection is pretty small down here, so we're not\n12 going to include that. But make sure they include that\n13 stiffness. Because even a small deflection below ground\n14 will cause a lot of stress in concrete piles.\n15                      MR. ANDERSON: Yes. Yeah, we're going to\n16 take the casing probably down to the relief point. And\n17 it - - itisn't - -\n18                      MR. ELY: The (inaudible) point you mean?\n19 Well, okay (inaudible.)\n20                      MR. ANDERSON: Yes, yes. And I don't\n21 believe that the point is going to be very deep into the\n22 soil, because it's pretty damned stiff as you start\n23 dropping down to that level. Remember, in the B row\n24 piling, we're actually into that 45-foot sand strata,\n25 all right, and that's going to give us some pretty good\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        0008.0014\n\f                                                                 15\n1    holding force.\n2                     MR. THIESS: Okay. All right. Anyone\n3    else? Is that it, Andy? Is there anything else?\n4    Anyone else comments on the wharf? I have one comment\n5    I'd like to - - we have one outstanding submittal on the\n6    welding. And it's for - - for the wharfside for the\n7    supplies. The QC or the welding rod, electrodes, we need\n8    to get that and finish out. Otherwise you're not - -\n9    you're not 100 percent passing your welding - -\n10                    MR. ANDERSON: What do you need, just the\n11 (Inaudible) the rods?\n12                    MR. THIESS: No, we need the QC\n13 procedures, the dry control box, the storage - -\n14                    MR. ANDERSON: Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.\n15 Gotcha.\n16                    MR. THIESS: Like to have that. Okay.\n17 That's it. If no one else has anything on the wharf,\n18 we'll move to the container yard.\n19                    (End of requested portion of\n20                    Construction Coordination Meeting.)\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0015\n\f                                                                     16\n\n 1 ,STATE OF TEXAS)\n 2   COOPt OF     HARRIS)\n 3        ~            REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n 4     ~I, ~L.

Projected increases in demand ft:rr containerized\n                 cargo will require two 1,000-foot berths at terminal opening. Exte:-:ding the wharf 332 feet under the\n                 current contract is feasible and wm assure the reQuired berths are available. Construction of the\n                 extension can only be conducted within lhe schedule by the present Wharf and Dredging contractor\n                 because of construction structures currently in place which cannot be removed or relocated withou1\n                 adversely affecting on-going wharf construction.. Additionally, the current contractor's unique method\n                 of construction is the only practicable means of achieving strict emissions requirements for this\n                 contrac1. The contractor has submitted a proposal in the estimated amount of $12,962,800 for the 332\n                 root wharf extension. The Engineering Department and the Phase 1A Program Manager have\n                 reviewed the contraclo(s proposal and found it to be fair and reasonable.\n\n                 It is therefore recommended that the Por1 Commission at its July 25, 2t1()5 meeting authorize a change\n                 order in the estimated amount of $12,962.800 to the Zachry Construction Corporation contract for\n                 Bayport T enninal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging and that such action further au1horize the\n                 Executive Director to do any and alllhings in his opinion reasonable or necessary to g..:Ye effect to the\n                 foregoing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   006.016.033.Z6Z\n\n                                                                            V.LM.CJL.tk                             PHA 0014992\n                                                                           ExHIBIT NO.\\~~\n\n                                                                           Jo... 1q -o 7 :::J1.f\n\n                                                                                                                                 No. 2006-72970\n                                                                                                                                ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                                     224\n\n                                                                                                                                             0224.0001\n\f...   -: ·. :·      ,·· ·\n\n ·'\nJ'\n                                        •                                     •\n                              Change Order to Zacllry ConstnJ<;tlon Corporation for-\n                    Bayport TenninaJ Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging-Wharf Extension\n\n                 Dascription:   ·   Staff recommends construction of a 332' wharf extension to the\n                                    current contract.

The remaining eastern portion, as well as the 330-foot extension, will then be\ncompleted after that time with the cutoff wall separating the east and west portions, The cutoff wall will be\ncomprised of a combination of frozen soil and steel sheet piles to provide retention of soil and groundwater\nduring construction and excavation. This wall will then be removed from the final grade up, in the same\nfashion as the primary frozen soil shoring wall that runs east-west in front of the wharf. However, the wharf\ndeck will cover most of the cutoff wall and therefore, wall removal will need to be accomplished in water by\ndivers after both sides are excavated out. As this design is draft and presented to the construction team for\ncomments, some refinement of the details presented herein may be appropriate. A final version, together with\na drafted set of plans will be prepared afler comments from the construction team and Port consu ltants, as\nappropriate: have been incorporated.\n\n                                                   CUTOFF WALL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe cutoff wall 'will be located perpendicular to the wharf at drilled shaft line no. 59.5 (Station ~81+50), as\nshown on the attached plan, Figure 1. Zachry has left this portion of the pile caps and decking open to allow\naccess for installing the cutoff wall. After the cutoff sheet piles and freeze pipe system are in place, Zachry\nwill complete the closure section of tbe decking.\n\nAt its deepest point near A-Line, the cutoff wall \\'\\1.11 need to retain soil and groundwater from the design\nwater level elevation of +8 feet MLL W to the bottom of the excavation (-53 feet Elevation after the keyway is\nbackfilled), for a total free-face height of 61 feet. South of A-Line, the height of the wall will reduce at a rate\nof2H:1V, following the final grade of the slope as shown in Figure 2. The south wall will end about 4 inches\nfrom the from the Il-line piles. The north end will be embedded WIthin the primary frozen soil shoring wall,\n\nThe sheet sheets will be AZ26 steel sections driven to depths ranging from about 6 to 15 feet below the\nbottom of excavation (-9 to 18 feet below the bottom of final grade). The soil in between the two sheets will\nbe frozen using primarily 2 to 3 rows of freeze pipes in the 8-foot-wide wharf area plus additional rows in the\nwider area between the wharf and the primary frozen soil shoring wall.

These freeze pipes will extend\ndown to depths of 80 to 100 feet, as shown on Figure 2 to provide additional lateral support and to cut off\ngroundwater within the dense sand layer encountered in borings between about 55 and 75 feet in depth. The\ntop of the frozen ground in between the steel sheets will be at Elevation +8 feet, the same as the primary\nfrozen soil shoring wall. The top of the steel sheets will be at Elevation +9 feet, one foot above the soil\ninside, to provide a buffer from waves and to contain brine manifold lines. A whaler consisting of a W12x79\nsection will be attached to the top of the wall. Steel Lies located just below the ground surface and spaced at 8\nfeet on center will be installed through the two sheets and whaler to provide a positive connection of the two\nsheets at the top. A detail cross section at the top of the wall is shown in Figure 4.\n\n                                        ENGINEERING ANALYSIS\n\nOne of the key elements of til is design is to limit the horizontal wall deformation, and therefore deformation\nof the soil retained behind it, to a small amount such that this movement will not adversely affect the\nstructural integrity of the drilled shafts that support the wharf. 1\\ second key element is to limit the growth of\nthe frozen soil such that it does not freeze these same drilled shafts.\n\nWe completed dozens of thermal and structural finite-element analyses to evaluate the expected deformation\nof the frozen soil/sheet pile cutoff wall. To optimize the thermal aspects, we used TEMP/W, a 2D finite\nelement thermal model program. To evaluate the deformation of the wall under various loading conditions,\nwe used both 2D and 3D versions of PLAXIS, a finite element soil/structure model. The 2D TEMP/Wand\nthe 2D PLAXIS programs are discussed in more detail in our report for tile primary frozen soil shoring wall,\ndated February 4, 2005. The cutoff wall is a high, wide, stiff structural element that is essentially fixed at\neach end (the frozen soil shoring wall at the north and the slope at the south). Without the embedment at the\nwall ends, our 2D analyses indicate that wall horizontal movement after one side is excavated in the dry will\nlikely be excessive. The end effects of this wall can only be evaluated using a 3D model as discussed in a\nsubsequent section.\n\nTHERMAL ANALYSES\n\nWe analyzed numerous freeze pipe layouts and brine temperatures using TEMP/W to evaluate the impact on\n1) the average temperature of the soil within the steel sheets and 2) the extent of frozen soil into the ground\nrelative to the wharf piles. The two goals are opposite. Colder brine and more freeze pipes freezes the soil\ncolder, which results in stronger and stiffer ground and very small wall movements, however, frozen soil\nextends outward past the sheets over 5 feet, the approximate distance to the wharf piles, after 3 or 4 months of\nfreezing. Warmer brine and less freeze pipes and limits the extent of frozen ground so that it does not reach\nthe existing wharf piles, however, the frozen soil is less strong and wall movements will increase. Our\nthermal analyses were completed to optimize the freeze system to satisfy both constraints.\n\nOur analyses indicate that the optimal layout of freeze pipes is as shown approximately on Figure 5. These\nresults from TE\\1P/W show a close-up view of an 8-fa or-wide section of wall beneath the wharf that includes\nseven freeze pipes, the steel sheet and one of the existing drilled shafts. The overall layout of freeze pipes is\nshown in Figure I and includes freeze pipe locations in the wider zone of the wall north of tile wharf. Most of\nthe 8-foot section has 2 rows of freeze pipes spaced at ~4 feet (4. J 3 feet = I per 2 AZ26 sheets) that extend\ndown 80 to 100 feet in depth to cut off groundwater in the dense sand and provide adequate structural\nstability. Five extra freeze pipes are to be installed as a third row in tbe highest P3.1.t of the wall between A\nand D lines. Our plan is to freeze down the soil in between the freeze pipes as quickly as practical using cold\nbrine in all three rows of freeze pipes. After 2 months or so of freezing, the outside rows will be maintained\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           ZCC-40-009167\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                     0010.0002\n\fMemorandum to Larry Applegate(SoiIFreeze) and Charles Rogers (Zachry)\nSeptember 9,2005\nPage 3\n\n\nto about +20F while the inside row is maintained at -20F. This limits frozen soil growth to more than 1 foot\nfrom the wharf piles after 6 months of freeze, as shown in Figure 5. The extent of frozen ground is\nprogressively less with less time of freezing. To accomplish this zoned type of freeze control, SoilFreeze will\nneed to install two separate freezing systems for this wall. The colder freeze section will be applied to those\nfreeze pipes encircled on Figure 1. The single black dots on Figure I represent pipes connected to a variable\nfreeze system. The average ground temperature inside the sheet piles is maintained below 20F, even in the\nwanner freeze section, which is needed to provide sufficient wall stiffness and strength, discussed more in the\nfollowing section.\n\nSome modification of the brine temperatures will be needed during the project, the extent of which will\ndepend on the specific ground response to freezing. As with the primary wall, ground temperatures will be\nmonitored throughout the process so that we can change the brine temperatures as appropriate to maintain\ncold temperatures inside the cutoff wall while limiting frozen soil growth outside.\n\nAfter the first (west) side of the wharf is excavated, the west side of the sheet pile wall will be exposed. At\nthis time it will be necessary to spray the surface of the steel with foam insulation. Tile insulation is needed to\nprevent the soil inside the wall from melting when this west side is filled with water.\n\nP~SSTRUCTURALANALYSES\n\nThe frozen soil temperatures obtained from TEMP/W, discussed above, were used to obtain frozen soil\nstrength and stiffness values for use as input to PLAXlS 3D. 1110 problem is quite complex to model and\nrequired nearly 10,000 elements as illustrated in Figure 6, which represents the 3D grid for this analysis. We\ncompleted several dozen computers run varying wall geometry, frozen soil strength, sheet pile sections and\nother variables in order to develop a solution that results in little wall movement and moderate wall thickness\nand depth. We also performed a series of 2D PLAXIS analyses to evaluate the relationship between wall/soil\nmovement and the impact on the drilled shafts. These:2D analyses indicate that up to about 2 inches of soil\ndeflection near the piles before the onset of plastic hinging. The results of the PLAX1S J D analyses indicate\nthe maximum horizontal wall movement will be on the order of I inch for an eight foot wide wall that utilizes\nAZ26 sections embedded as shown in Figure 2. This results in a factor of safety against plastic hinging of 2.\nThis deformation estimate is considered to be a conservative estimate because we did not include the positive\neffect of the numerous concrete piles or the whaler on reducing soil movement in our modeling. Based on\nthese analyses, it is our opinion that the cutoff wall should retain soil and groundwater after excavation on one\nside is completed with little wall movement which should not impact the existing wharf piles.\n\nThe cutoff wall is located in between pile rows 59 and 60, which are 20.5 feet apart. The steel sheets will be\nlocated about 5 feet from the wharf piles along these rows. Line B has additional piles so that one of Line B\npiles is located within the cutoff wall, as seen on Figure 1. To reduce the impact of the cutoff wall on this one\npile, we have included a 42\" to 48\" diameter casing to be installed around the Line B pile before the start of\nfreezing. The purpose of the casing is to protect the Line B pile as the wall moves during excavation. If it\nwas embedded in frozen soil, the very rigid cutoff wall movement may exert undue forces on this pile. The\ncollar will extend to the bottom of the excavation. The annulus between the pile and the casing will be\ncleaned out by Zachry and air will remain in the annulus throughout the life of the cutoff walL As the cutoff\nwall moves laterally the estimated 1 inch during excavation, the Line B pile will remain vertical and\nuntouched by the wall within the zone above the excavation depth.\n\n\n\n\n

Jackson\n\nSubject:        Recommendation for Approval of Change Order No. 4 in the Estimated\n                Amount of $12,962,800 to Zachry Construction Corporation for Bayport\n                Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging                             .\n\nBy Minute 2004-0524-13, the Port Commission awarded a contract in the estimated amount of\n$62,485,733 to Zachry Construction Corporation (ZCC) for Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A\nWharf and Dredging.\n\nThe initial contract provides for a 1,660-foot wharf. Projected increases in demand for\ncontainerized cargo will require two 1·,OOO-foot berths at terminal opening. Extending the wharf\n332 feet under the current contract is feasible and will assure the required berths are available.\nConstruction of the extension can only be conducted within the schedule by the present Wharf\nand Dredging contractor because of construction structures currently in place which cannot be\nremoved or relocated without adversely affecting ongoing wharf construction. Additionally, the\ncurrent contractor's unique method of construction is the only practicable means of achieving\nstrict emissions requirements for this contract. The contractor has submitted a proposal in the\nestimated amount of $12,962,800 forthe 332-foot wharf extension. The Engineering Department\nand the Phase 1A Program Manager have reviewed the contractor's proposal and found it to be\nfair and reasonable.\n\nBy Minute 2005-0725-18, the Port Commission authorized the issuance of a change order in the\nestimated amount of $12,962,800 to Zachry Construction Corporation for the above described\nchanges. Accordingly, please sign the attached change order and return it to the Engineering\nDepartment for further handling.\n\n\n\n\nJBJ/SHD/MV: ~\n\nAttachment\n\nC:      Mr.   Andrew Thless, P.E. - CH2M HILL, Inc.\n        Mr.   Forbes Baker\n        Mr.   James Turner\n        Mr.   Mark Vincent, P.E.\n        Mr.   Jim McQueen, P.E.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             005.010.019069\n\n                                                                                             PHA0012047\n\n\n                                                                                                         0012.0003\n\f                                      SCOPE, TIME,AND PRICE MODIFICATIONS\n                                        TO SPECIFICATIONS AND PROPOSAL\n                                    Bayport Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n\n                                            PORT OF HOUSTON AUTHORITY\n                                                       P.

As a result of negotiation, the following\nscope. time. and price modifications were made to Proposer's Specifications and Proposal dated April 13, 2005, as\namended by Proposals for 330 feet Wharf Extension and as further amended by Proposer's Supplemental Proposal dated\nJuly 11, 2005 except Ditch K construction will not be part of this agreemenl\n\n\n1. Contractor shall construct 332 linear feet of Wharf utilizing the same construction methods outlined in the original 1,660\nlinear feet of wharf, for a total price of $12,962,800.\n\n2. The Proposal price includes incorporation of change orders. RFl's to the original 1,660 linear feet of wharf incorporated\nthrough July 25, 2005.\n\n3. PHA will furnish pile depths not later than August 12,2005. PHA shall furnish remaining wharf design documents by\nNovember 25, 2005.\n\n4. Change order includes construction of an additional 332 linear feet of chain link fencing with three-strand anti-climb\nbars installed and, a drainage swell at the East end of the wharf extension to connect 10 the existing drainage, for an\ninclusive cost not to exceed $15.500.\n\n5. The basis of drilled shaft construction is 21,266.5 linear feet of drilled shafts at a unit cost of $82/LF for a total cost not\nto exceed $1,743,853, included in the change order price. Adjustments to shaft length will be made at a rate-of $82 per\nlinear foot of increased shaft length or cost reduction of $43 per linear foot of shaft length reduction.\n\n6. The 332-feel Wharf Exlension Construction and all other components of the contract shall be completed by July 15.\n2006. The interim completion date to accommodate the ship-to-shore crane arrival, as per the original contract is revised\nto February 15, 2006. and the length of wharf available at that time is changed to 850 linear feet, along with associated\ndredging to receive the crane transport vessel. The February 15, 2005 milestone completion date requires that the\npermanent power components as described in the contract documents be provided for the Ship to Shore Cranes. The\noriginal 1660 linear feet of wharf main deck and drilled piers shall be completed by June 1,2006.\n\n7. The contractor's proposal originally assumed only 80,000 cubic yards of dredge malerial. The dredge quantity was\nrevised from 80,000 to 110,000 cubic yards based upon actual survey. The Contractor will dredge and place 110,000\ncubic yards of material in designated disposal areas at a rate of $13.15/cubic yard. for an increase of $1,446.500 inclusive\nin the change order price. Any quantity dredged short of the base quantity of 110,000 cubic yards, the remaining balance\nof the yardage to equal 110,000 cubic yards shall be paid to ZCC at a rate of $ 0.54 per cubic yard. this equals a credit to\nPOHA at a rate of $12.61 per cubic yard on Ihe under dredge quantity. Any quantity dredged in excess of 110,000 cubic\nyards will be paid at the unit rate of $13.15/ cy_\n\n8.

Using the design load {250 tons) and shaft embedment shown on DMJM Harris drawings and the\n                       unfrozen soil strength ·data presented in Geotest's report, we had the program calculate the shaft settlement\n                       and factor of safety (FS) for 4 cases: 1} no soU strength reduction (current condition), 2) 10% strength\n                       reduction, 3) 20% strength reauction and 4) 30\"/0 strength reduction. Keep in mind that the shafts extend\n                       below the bottom of the freezing, so the lower portion wi II not be 1m pacted at all by freezing. To be\n                       conservat.i ve we assumed that the entire soil mass around the shaft between final slope grade and the\n                       10Q-foot depth was frozen and then thaw~, not just up to 1 foot away as shown In our submittal.\n\n                       The results are as follows:\n\n                                CASE                                           FS         Settlement at Design Load\n                       1. No reduction in soil strength                        3.2               0.14D\n                       2. 10% reduction in soil strength                       3.1               0.15\"\n                       3. 20% reduction in soil strength                       2.9               0.16\"\n                       4. 30% reduction in soil strength                       2.5               0.17\"\n\n                       I also calculated the average unfrozen and thawed strength of the clay soil from the Houston Bayport project\n                       from the data presented in our 2125/05 soils report. As it turns out the avera_   ge unfrozen compressive\n                       strength {no freezing) from a total of 3 tests is -7 ksf while the average thawed strength for the same samples\n                       is -9.ksf, which indicates an increase instead of a decrease in strength due to freezing and thawing. This\n                      probably isn't real and is likely due to the natural scatter in soil properties. I would expect that we would see\n                       some minor reduction in the average strength after thawing if we completed lots more of the same type of\n                      tests. A good article was written about affect of freeze-thaw on strength of son by Graham and Au in 1985.\n                      From many tests, they found that the strength reduction of silt (very similar to our clay) is about 3b<'lo after 5\n                      freeze-thaw cycles. Unfortunately, they did not do a test after just one f~eeze-thaw cycle {like we will have at\n                      this project) which should show a higher strength than soil exposed to 5 freeze-thaw cycles. After talking\n                      with Dave Sego, other researchers have found similar results. We also have dense sand at depth. The effect\n                      of freeze-thaw on the strength of sand is typically less than on clay because of the fact that the sand generally\n                      does not develop much ice formation. Based on all this information, we may see no more than about a 10%\n                      to 15% reduction in overall strength for the Houston Bayport soil, in my opinion.\n\n                      Assuming a conservative 15% strength reduction in the soil after thawing and considering the results from\n                      PLAXIS shown above, it appears that even if we freeze all the soil around the drilled shafts (not just up to 1\n                      foot away) we will only see a minor reduction in the factor of safety (3.2 to 3.0) and virtually no increase in\n                      shaft settlement. From this information, it looks to me as if we really don't need to worry too much about\n                      freezing the soil around the shafts.\n.... ··:..\n\n                      DISCL'.IMER: Any electronic form, facsimile Of hard copy of the original document          (J--------.,).if provided, and any\n                      attachments we only a copy of the llfiginal document The original document is                     ~                             an:!   wm serve as   the\n                      official document or rElC()fd.                                                                    ~\n\n                                                                                                                       EXHIBIT NO• .fll\n                                                                                                                       II ~o' -6 7 .:r I-f\n                                                                                                                                                                P- FIP.015421\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                  0014.0001\n\f                          ...........·   .....                .. .

ZCC's submittal for the cutoff wall, however, indicates freezing of soil as close as one foot\n                from as many as 14 piles, which is inside the zone of soil that has structural impact on the\n                friction resistance of the piles. However, preliminary Indications are that the design may have\n                an indeterminate affect on a significant number of nearby shafts which may present\n                unacceptable risk to the Port of Houston.\n                Contractor must present alternative cutoff wall design, such as a cellular sheet pile wall or\n                grout wall, that provides the desired cutoff effect with.less risk to the structural integrity of the\n                wharf. Or the contractor may present the Port of Houston with an altemate means of\n                mitigating risk to the structural integrity of the wharf.\n  Primary       Revise and Resubmit\n  Response\n  Submission\n  Notes\n\n\n Dates\n\n Material                                       Required Lead Time (days}\n Required on\n Site\n Approved                                       Required Review Time (days)        20\n Submittal\n Required By\n Submission\n Due\n\n\n  Linked Documents\n\n  Document Type          Document                            Description                               Date\n  Doc                    C70-1A-D01-01636                                                             9/12/2005\n\n\n                                                                           No. 2006-72970\n                                                                        ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                    ZCC-EXP-0000073\n                                                                             266\n                                                                                                                        0266.0001\n\fDistribution\n\n    Recipient                 Company                             Method               Date\nCharles Rogers   Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email: rogersc@zachry.com        10/11/2005\nDavid Griffin    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email : griffindg@zachry.com     10/11/2005\nDavid Griffin    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Message                          10/11/2005\nJeff Ely         CH2M HILL                           Email: jelyl@ch2m.com             9/14/2005\nJeff Ely         CH2M HI LL                          Message                           9/14/2005\nRich Kl assen    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Message                          10/11/2005\nRich Klassen     Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email: andersonhe@zachry.com     10/11/2005\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    ZCC-EXP-0000074\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   0266.0002\n\f                TAB 34\n\n     Transcript of October 11, 2005\nWeekly Construction Coordination Meeting\n                (PX314)\n\f1                  IN THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF\n                        HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS\n2\n3    ZACHRY CONSTRUCTION           )\n     CORPORATION,                  )\n4                                  )\n              Plaintiff,           )\n5                                  )\n     V.                            )\n6                                  )\n     PORT OF HOUSTON               )      CAUSE NO.\n7    AUTHORITY,                    )      2006-72970\n                                   )\n8             Defendant.           )\n                                   )\n9                                  )\n                                   )\n10                                 )\n11\n12\n13\n14\n             Weekly Construction Coordination Meeting\n15\n                      Date: October 11, 2005\n16\n                      Minutes: 08:40- 13:29\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n                                                         No. 2006-72970\n                                                        ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                           314\n\f         2\n          1 Audio Reporting Transcribed by:\n          2\n          3    JENNIFER HAYNIE\n               ALPHA REPORTING CORPORATION\n          4    236 Adams Avenue\n               Memphis, Tennessee 38103\n          5    901.523.8974\n          6\n          7\n               Proper names and inaudibles or undiscernible\n          8 testimony was provided Andy Anderson.\n          9\n         10\n         11\n         12\n         13\n         14\n         15\n         16\n         17\n         18\n         19\n         20\n         21\n         22\n         23\n         24\n         25\n\n.;:\n~·\n\n·:,'..\n\f                                                           3\n     1 Date:     October 11, 2005\n     2 Minutes: 8:40 - 13:29\n     3    (Requested portion of Weekly Construction\n     4           Coordination Meeting.)\n     5          ANDY THIESS: Then the pile\n:·   6 redesign for the cut off wall.

Now, the\n     10 answer to this it says that the contractor --\n     11 first of aU, this says \"no, resubmit. 11 All\n     12 right. There's a number of avenues to go here.\n     13 Number one, they ask for an alternative cutoff\n     14 such as a ceUular sheet pile wall. There is a\n     15 cellular sheet pile wall between the freeze pipe\n     16 and the piles. That's the cut off wall. That's\n     17 the structure.\n     18          ANDY THIESS: I understand.\n     19          ANDY ANDERSON: I don't think they\n     20 understand.\n     21          ANDYTHIESS: No. Theyunderstand.\n     22          ANDY ANDERSON: Well, then what are they\n     23 talking about? The freeze pipes are contained\n     24 within the sheet pile wall.\n     25          ANDY THIESS: They're talking about\n\f4\n1 a cellular meaning like a honeycomb structure.\n2 Some sort of structural sheet pile wall.\n3           ANDY ANDERSON: Okay. Now, we get\n4 it.\n5           JOHN GLASGOW: Then we don't have to\n6 freeze it.\n7           ANDYTHIESS: Correct.\n8           JIM MCQUEEN: Yeah. Yeah. That's\n9 the concem.\n10          ANDY THIESS: Or slurry or soil\n11 cement or any other -- any other method of\n12 putting in this wall that is not such a high\n13 risk to the structure.\n14          JOHN GLASGOW: DanMageau was\n15 supposed to be here today, right?\n16           CHARLES RODGERS: Tomorrow.\n17          JOHN GLASGOW Tomorrow. And Corey\n18 was going to bring that up with him and see if it\n19 willfly.\n20          ANDY ANDERSON: We will look at it, but two things.\n21 Number one, if we want to accept the\n22 risk. It's not -- it's not a submittal. It\n23 is for information purposes only, okay, and\n24 number two, our price is predicated on current\n25 construction methods and that was clearly\n\f                                                         5\n1 defined. Now, chances are based on the price\n2 of this goddamn cut off wall you know, we can design\n3 something and stay within the parameters of what\n4 we got.\n5           ANDY THIESS: That's all the Port's\n6 asking for.\n7           ANDY ANDERSON: And we will look at that,\n8 and we need to look at it very, very quickly.\n9           ANDY THIESS: But I think ify'all\n10 design something alternate, if it can be done,\n11 it will be real easy--\n12          JIM MCQUEEN: I want you to\n13 understand the spirit of this whole thing is\n14 that we -- the problem is that it jeopardizes\n15 some footings on either side, piers on\n16 either side.\n17          There's a possibility of that, okay,\n18 and there's a tisk. We know that you guys are\n19 taking that, but we're not-- we're not\n20 necessarily sure that we want you to take that. .\n21 There's a lot of concern and we're not rejecting\n22 it all together as we're not going to do it.\n23 We're still throwing money at evaluation, but we\n24 would like to know if there's another\n25 alternative.\n\f6\n 1          ANDY ANDERSON: We'll look at it. I\n 2 half way looked at a bin wall early on in this,\n 3 but to be quite honest with you, I looked at a\n 4 bin wall for replacement of the freeze wall\n 5 itself Not the cut off wall. The problem was\n 6 in the freeze wall was that the soil has no\n 7 abiJity to handle the stress of the bin wall.\n 8 It would just collapse.\n 9          Now, the cut off wall is something a little\n10 something different, you know, and I need to\n11 look at that. The problem I see with that is we\n12 still have to design it so that it runs between\n13 the piles and does not encase the pile row because\n14 I'm worried about the lateral movement of the\n15 wall when pressure is relived on one side and I\n16 don't want to side load these piles.\n17          At any rate, a semicircular cell\n18 possibly could work. Now I have to, you fucking ruined my\n19 whole a:ftemoon, now I'll have to sit down and .. .\n20          .TIM MCQUEEN: Because we heard you\n21 were out playing golf.\n22          ANDY ANDERSON: That's tomon·ow. But\n23 we'll look at it and see what we can do on it,\n24 but I want to caution-- the designers need to\n25 understand that this is not a submittal that\n\f                                                             7\n     1 requires approval, and we are worlcing with you and\n     2 we'll come up with something else.\n     3          JIM MCQUEEN: We understand, or at\n     4 least I understand, and the latter part too, the\n     5 cost issue.\n     6          ANDY ANDERSON: I do not want to\n     7 have to have to readdress that issue.\n     8          JIM MCQUEEN:       rm not-- no one\n     9 in our... but we just want you to look.\n     10         ANDY ANDERSON: I will look at it\n     11 very hard. Luckily Mageau is going to be here\n     12 tomorrow so we may actually be able get\n     13 something resolved quickly.

Based on designer input prior to design\nof the original freeze wall, it was expected that the cutoff wall would be designed in a way to avoid\ncompromising any piers by freezing, except for one pier in Row B that was identified by ZCC beforehand.\nThe original freeze wall design accomodated a 6 feet setback from the nearest piers as requested by the\ndesigners. Potential freezing of piers resulting in loss of load capacity is the basis for PHA concerns\nregarding the cutoff wall design. These concerns have not been adequately addressed in the cutoff wall\nsubmittal.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to include this in your memo. Zachry has implied that they believe our review\nand rejection of the cutoff wall design is a breach of their change order contract, as they told us there would\nbe a cutoff wall. They believe this gives them a claim for time. We need to make the point that we\nanticipated it being designed according to the criteria of the original freezed wall. Otherwise we will have to\nstate this separately in another letter.\n\n\n\nFrom: Ely, Jeff/HOU\nSent: Friday, November 11,20052:49 PM\nTo: James McQueen; Mark Vincent; Farhat, Jerry; Thiess, AndrewjHOU; Johnson, Robert/HOU\nee: Emsley, Laurence/HOU\nSubject: cutofCwalLresponse.doc\n\n All:\n Please provide any comments by COB Monday, November 14.

Management Plan (CMP) is to provide the framework for\nconstruction management consistency, continuity, quality control, timeliness and teamwork\nfor successful completion of Phase 1A of the Port of Houston Authority's (PHA) Bayport\nTerminal Complex.\nThe CMP will outline common procedures to be utilized by the Construction Management\nTeam (CMT), which consists of CH2M HILL Program and Construction Management (CM)\nstaff, PHA representatives, contractors and the Designers of Record (DOR) for the Phase 1A\nconstruction contracts. The CMP will be the reference document providing continuity for\nall CMT members involved in Phase 1A construction. It will define the construction\ncontracts' specific quality assurance requirements, consolidate current construction\nmanagement field policy for easy reference and retrieval, and outline the relationships of\nthe various functions to be performed by the CMT members. The CMT members will use\nthe CMP as a guidance document to ensure Phase 1A of the Bayport terminal complex is\nbuilt to the highest available standards of quality and in accordance with the general and\ntechnical provisions of each Phase 1A contract.\n\n\n1.2 Project Description\nCH2M HILL is providing Program and Construction Management services to PHA for the\ninitial development phase of the estimated $1.2 billion Bayport Terminal Complex. The Port\nof Houston is the busiest port origination/ destination on the United States Gulf. The Port is\nthe world's sixth largest port and is the number one u.s port in foreign tonnage,\ntransshipping more than 150 million tons of cargo annually. At ultimate build-out, the\nBayport Terminal Complex will be the largest container transshipment facility in the United\nStates and include inter-modal rail transfer facilities, cruise terminals and associated\ncommercial developments supporting both the container and cruise terminals.\nCH2M HILL acts as the Port's primary contact for the initial project development phase,\nproviding oversight, communication and coordination for multiple facility design and\nconstruction contracts. Phase lA, the initial development, consists of the design and\nconstruction of 1,660 linear feet of reinforced concrete container wharf supported by\nreinforced concrete drilled piers; reinforced concrete tangent bulkhead wall;\naccess/berthing dredging and on-site disposal of dredged materials; clearing, grubbing and\nearthwork; heavy duty reinforced concrete and asphalt paved container handling, storage\nand transfer yard; signage and pavement markings; electrical substation, transmission and\ndistribution utilities; elevated water storage tank, fire and potable water transmission and\ndistribution lines; storm water drainage lines and storm water pollution prevention\nfacilities; sanitary sewer, pumping station and force mains; site lighting; site\nsecurity/monitoring, fire alarm/ detection, communications and electronic data utilities;\ntemporary and Amenities buildings; and associated construction activities.\n\n                                                             2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 0057.0007\n\f    2.0 Staffing Plan\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n                        0057.0008\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n2.1      Project Organization\nThe Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A CMT will serve as the construction administration\nand management representatives for PHA. The CMT, in this role, will coordinate all\nconstruction activities and services required for the successful completion of Phase 1A\nconstruction. The on-site CM Field Staff will consist of a Construction Manager (CM), an\nOffice Engineer, a Lead Inspector, and Civil/Structural/Electrical Inspectors. This staff will\nbe provided by CH2M HILL and its sub-consultants. The CMT also includes PHA project\nmanagement and construction administration staff; Designers of Record (DaR) for each\nconstruction contract; CH2M HILL construction administrative and technical support staff;\nPHA construction materials testing firms; and any other involved parties performing\nconstruction related activities and services.\nThe CM will report directly to PHA's Bayport Project Manager, Chief Engineer, Project\nEngineer, and Chief Inspector as well as the CH2M HILL Program Manager (PM). The CM\nwill coordinate and oversee the daily activities of the CM Field Staff, 3rd party testing\nlaboratory personnel, 3rd party surveyors, 3rd party inspectors and auditors, and other\nCMT members involved in the construction work. The CM is directly responsible for the\ncoordination and oversight of the CM Field Staff.\nThe CMT organizational chart is shown on Attachment 1, \"Construction Management Team\nOrganizational Chart.\" The individual roles and responsibilities of the CM Field Staff are\nshown on Attachment 2, \"CM Field Staff Responsibilities Matrix.\"\n\n\n2.2 Construction Manager\nThe CM shall act as the PHA's representative on site during construction of Phase 1A. The\nCM shall be the Inspector for the work and have all authority delegated to the Inspector by\nthe contract documents. The CM will coordinate the activities of all contractors and DOR\nperforming work on site during Phase 1A construction, and will be responsible for\nimplementation of the Staffing Plan, Communications Plan, Field Work Plan, Quality\nAssurance Plan, Risk Mitigation Plan, and Closeout Plan as described in this CMP.\n\n         2.2.1 Construction Manager Level of Authority\n         As an extension of the PHA staff, the CM will have all authority normally attributed\n         to a CM acting as owner's agent (not at risk) on a construction project. The CM will\n         have the authority to inspect, monitor and control activities on the project site as\n         necessary to protect PHA's liability with regard to project scope, schedule, quality,\n         security, and permit compliance, in accordance with industry-standard practice.\n\n         The CM will not have any authority to make changes to any provisions of the PHA-\n         Contractor construction contract documents in regard to costs (increase or decrease\n         in contract price); time for completion (accelerated or extended contract completion\n\n                                                            4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 0057.0009\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n         time); or quality of in-place work (lessen or increase the contract quality\n         requirements for construction materials and/ or workmanship).\n\n         The CM will have the authority to control communications and documentation\n         contributing to the permanent project record, clarify and interpret construction\n         contract documents, and make on-site field administrative/ engineering/ quality\n         assurance decisions, subject to the limitations outlined above. The CM will promote\n         harmonious communication, cooperation and coordination between all contractors\n         and construction activities. The CM will investigate on-site field\n         deficiencies/ discrepancies/ problems and resolve them, if no changes to the\n         construction contract cost, time for completion and/ or construction materials and/ or\n         workmanship are required. If the resolution of an on-site field\n         deficiency/discrepancy/problem requires a change to the contract cost, time for\n         completion and/ or quality of construction materials and/ or workmanship, the CM\n         will investigate and make recommendations to the Port of Houston Authority's\n         Chief Engineer for resolution.\n\n         The CM will provide no direction related to the Contractor's construction means,\n         methods, procedures, safety, sequencing and/ or techniques. The CM will observe\n         and report on the Contractor's construction safety, workmanship and materials, as it\n         relates to quality assurance and the in-place construction work being in conformance\n         with Construction Contract Documents (CCD) (i.e., construction contract General\n         and Special Conditions, drawings, technical specification sections and approved\n         Contractor submittals).\n\n\n2.3 Lead Inspector\nThe Lead Inspector will be responsible for the construction documentation and quality\nassurance of multiple construction contracts awarded for Phase lA. The Lead Inspector will\nreport to the CM and will oversee and direct the work efforts of the Inspectors. The Lead\nInspector will be expected to maintain complete, up-to-date and detailed knowledge of all\npertinent construction contract documents; administrative and technical submittals; change\norders; field orders; progress schedules; drawings; plans; technical specifications; and\nadministrative status reports. The Lead Inspector will observe and monitor the contractors'\nplanning and execution of the work and perform quality assurance inspections of materials\nand workmanship to assure compliance with the CCD. The Lead Inspector will act as\nliaison between the contractors, Inspectors and PHA's construction inspection and materials\ntesting personnel. The Lead Inspector will be responsible for the use and implementation of\nPersonal Digital Assistants (PDA's) for field inspection activities; use of the proprietary\nAssure-It database for analysis and reporting of QA/QC data; preparation of daily, weekly,\nand monthly construction progress reports; making recommendations on contractors'\nprogress payment requests and invoices; maintaining a daily log and photos of the\ncontractors' construction activities, staffing, equipment, and materials; documenting\ncontractor performance and safety issues; and resolving on-site construction conflicts.\n                                                            5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  0057.0010\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n         4.28.3 Phase 1A Milestone Schedule\n         The CM Field Staff will create and maintain an overall Phase lA Milestone Schedule\n         based on the Contractors' approved baseline Progress Schedules.\n\n         The CM will use the contractors' accepted Progress Schedule Updates to update the\n         Phase lA Milestone Schedule on a monthly basis, or more frequently, as requested\n         by the PHA.\n\n\n4.29 Spare Parts\nCM Field Staff will take possession of all spare parts to be provided by construction\ncontractors, in accordance with the requirements of the project CCD. Contractors will tag\n(CH2M HILL Standard Spare Parts Identification Tag-Form No. 399) all spare parts to be\nturned over to the CM Field Staff. This turnover action will be documented (CH2M HILL\nStandard Spare Parts Transfer Form-Form No. 289) by the contractor and CM Field Staff.\nCM Field Staff will prepare and maintain a record (CH2M HILL Standard Spare Parts\nTransfer Log-Form No. 404) of all spare parts transfers.\n\n\n4.30 Submittals\nThe Contractor for each Phase lA construction contract will be responsible for developing a\nlist of submittals required by the CCD. Submittals lists will be reviewed by the CM for\ncompleteness. A static electronic copy of each Submittal List will be posted in\nConstructware®.\nAll submittals requiring action to be taken by a reviewing/ approving party will be\nsubmitted by the contractor (PHA General Conditions Section 5.20 \"Submittals to be\nFurnished by the Contractor after Award\") to the CM using Constructware®. The\nContractor will be responsible for following any electronic submittal with hard copy\nmaterials, if any, sent to the appropriate party for review.\nThe CM will distribute these submittals to the appropriate reviewing party. Once the\nreviewing party has reviewed, approved or indicated the actions to be taken by the\ncontractor to obtain approval, the submittal will be returned to the contractor through the\nCM. The reviewing party will electronically annotate all reviewed contractor submittals,\nindicating action(s) to be taken by the contractor: no exception taken; make corrections\nnoted; rejected; revise and resubmit; or submit specified item. The review notation will\ninclude places for the reviewer's electronic signature and date of signature.\nInformational submittals will also be submitted by the contractor through the CM in the\nsame manner as described above.\nThe CM Field Staff will document, distribute, file and log all submittals using\nConstructware®.\n                                                            28\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              0057.0033\n\f             TAB 40\n\nCourt’s Ruling on Directed Verdict\n             (71:8-15)\n\f                                                              8\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   denied.\n\n 2                    MS. YEATES:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:    Now, would you give me a\n\n 4   moment with respect to Zachry's motion?       I just want to\n\n 5   make a couple of quick notes.\n\n 6                    Okay.   Ms. Greer, or Mr. Gibbs, whoever.\n\n 7              PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR DIRECTED VERDICT\n\n 8                    MR. GIBBS:    Yes, Your Honor.     At this\n\n 9   time, Your Honor, the Plaintiff, Zachry Construction\n\n10   Corporation reurges its motion for directed verdict at\n\n11   the close of the Defendant's case and the close of all\n\n12   the evidence.\n\n13                    We filed with you our motion on Monday,\n\n14   January the 11th.    I think we gave you a copy on\n\n15   January the 11th.    And it was filed January the 13th.\n\n16                    And we reurge that motion for instructed\n\n17   verdict, and we also urge the argument Zachry made at\n\n18   the hearing on January the 13th, 2009 (sic) on the\n\n19   record, yesterday, as part of our motion for directed\n\n20   verdict.\n\n21                    THE COURT:    All right.   I'd like to go\n\n22   through the table of contents of that motion, if you\n\n23   have a copy.\n\n24                    MR. GIBBS:    We do, Your Honor.\n\n25                    THE COURT:    And also ask that -- if\n\f                                                              9\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   Ms. Greer wants to -- only because we all worked on the\n\n 2   jury charge together -- and the things that I'm\n\n 3   prepared to grant with respect to your directed verdict\n\n 4   are essentially what's in the jury charge.\n\n 5                 And so -- at this point, so if we could\n\n 6   go through that, point by point.       And you maybe could\n\n 7   bring to the Court's attention the ones that you think\n\n 8   that are granted by virtue of the current language of\n\n 9   the jury charge.\n\n10                 MS. GREER:     Do you want me to -- well, I\n\n11   know a couple of things off the top of my head, then\n\n12   maybe can I take half a minute to look through it?\n\n13                 THE COURT:     Please.\n\n14                 MS. GREER:     Okay.     Your Honor, we\n\n15   believe that you have ruled -- or we would ask you to\n\n16   rule on directed verdict that Zachry is entitled as a\n\n17   matter of law to recover the damages sustained by New\n\n18   Zachry on the pass-through claim.\n\n19                 We believe that's what you've instructed\n\n20   the jury, and we would ask you to grant our directed\n\n21   verdict on that issue.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     Okay.\n\n23                 MS.

Okay.   And I\n\n 3   have ruled on that, and I will grant that aspect of\n\n 4   your motion.\n\n 5                  MS. GREER:   And then, Your Honor, we've\n\n 6   also moved for directed verdict on Zachry's failure to\n\n 7   comply a claim for the Port's failure to pay $2.36\n\n 8   million in the liquidated damages.\n\n 9                  We believe that you have instructed the\n\n10   jury in --\n\n11                  THE REPORTER:   Are the mikes on?\n\n12                  MR.

GREER:   Yes.\n\n23                  And we would ask you to grant a directed\n\n24   verdict to Zachry on that basis.\n\n25                  THE COURT:   All right.   Go ahead, yes.\n\f                                                           11\n                      Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1                  MS.

What I've put in\n\n 5   the jury charge and what I'm prepared to grant is that\n\n 6   I have determined that the Port has failed to comply\n\n 7   with the contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36\n\n 8   million that the Port withheld as liquidated damages.\n\n 9                  Insofar as you have asked for that in a\n\n10   directed verdict, I'm granting that aspect of your\n\n11   motion.\n\n12                  MS. GREER:    Okay.   Thank you,\n\n13   Your Honor.\n\n14                  I believe that's all, Your Honor.\n\n15                  THE COURT:    All right.   I was -- so if\n\n16   you would look at the table of contents with me for a\n\n17   moment.   I was looking at -- in the table of contents\n\n18   Roman numeral -- Page Number Roman Numeral II, where\n\n19   you have Roman Numeral V -- 5, where it says, Zachry is\n\n20   entitled to a directed verdict on its right to recover\n\n21   damages sustained by New Zachry.\n\n22                  Is that covered by what I've previously\n\n23   set?\n\n24                  MS. GREER:    Yes, Your Honor, that is the\n\n25   portion of the directed verdict motion starts on Page\n\f                                                          12\n                     Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   69, that is the portion, that part, Part 5, Roman V is\n\n 2   the part that we believe that you have granted a\n\n 3   directed verdict motion on in the jury charge, and we\n\n 4   ask that you confirm that you granted directed verdict\n\n 5   on the arguments made therein.\n\n 6                 THE COURT:   All right.   It goes on to\n\n 7   say in subparts A -- in Subpart A of that -- in the\n\n 8   table of contents or in the motion, The direct verdict\n\n 9   is proper because the Port has met the burden to prove\n\n10   that Zachry is not liable to New Zachry and has -- and\n\n11   has not met that burden -- excuse me, because the Port\n\n12   has the burden of proof that Zachry is not liable to\n\n13   New Zachry and has not met that burden.\n\n14                 I guess my ruling is as a matter of law\n\n15   that I find that the -- there's a valid pass-through\n\n16   claim and any objections or legal arguments to the\n\n17   contrary by the Port are overruled.\n\n18                 MS. GREER:   Okay.   Thank you,\n\n19   Your Honor.\n\n20                 THE COURT:   Does that satisfy what\n\n21   you're asking for?\n\n22                 MS. GREER:   Well, we're asking you to\n\n23   rule as a matter of law that New Zachry,\n\n24   notwithstanding the Port's arguments to the contrary,\n\n25   has the right to -- that Zachry, notwithstanding the\n\f                                                             13\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   Port's arguments to the contrary, has the right to\n\n 2   recover New Zachry's damages as a matter of law in this\n\n 3   lawsuit.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Right.   I think that's what\n\n 5   I've granted.   I will grant that part of your motion.\n\n 6                   MS. GREER:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:    And I know the Port is\n\n 8   opposed to that.\n\n 9                   MS. YEATES:    (Moving head up and down)\n\n10                   THE COURT:    And I've granted with\n\n11   respect -- I indicated with respect to Roman Numeral VI\n\n12   on Page Roman Numeral III with respect to the $2.36\n\n13   million, and you've moved with respect to the clearing\n\n14   and grubbing, and I'm not speaking for the Port, but\n\n15   it's my understanding that the Port has essentially\n\n16   abandoned that claim in that there was not evidence\n\n17   that the 25,000 or so for clearing and grubbing has\n\n18   been paid?\n\n19                   MS. YEATES:    That's correct, Your Honor.\n\n20                   THE COURT:    All right.   So I'm granting\n\n21   that part of Zachry's motion.\n\n22                   The Port, in our charge conference, we\n\n23   talked about the defense of both release and waiver,\n\n24   and it's my understanding that the Port's contention\n\n25   has been that the waiver argument, not the affirmative\n\f                                                             14\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   defensive waiver but with respect to I guess the\n\n 2   liquidated damages claim?\n\n 3                 MS. YEATES:     Right, Your Honor.    With\n\n 4   respect to the liquidated damages, we took away or out\n\n 5   of the charge, Your Honor took it out, and we're only\n\n 6   arguing release.\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     All right.    So I guess I\n\n 8   will grant a directed verdict then with respect to the\n\n 9   waiver aspect of the release argument?\n\n10                 MS. GREER:     If they're going to abandon\n\n11   it, I think that's sufficient.    But --\n\n12                 THE COURT:     Are you -- do you want to\n\n13   abandon it on the record or what?\n\n14                 MS. YEATES:     No, Your Honor.    The point\n\n15   was that we wanted the charge to be submitted as\n\n16   release as opposed to release and waiver.       And that's\n\n17   what Your Honor has done with respect to the liquidated\n\n18   damages.\n\n19                 MS. GREER:     My understanding was that\n\n20   they aren't seeking submission of waiver because it\n\n21   brought (inaudible) -- well, I'm not going to\n\n22   characterize why they're doing it, but that they are\n\n23   not asking you to submit it is my understanding.\n\n24                 MS. YEATES:     Your Honor, I won't be\n\n25   objecting or requesting waiver instruction with respect\n\n26   to liquidated damages.\n\f                                                             15\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                          COURT'S RULING\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    All right.   Then I will make\n\n 3   no ruling.\n\n 4                    And I believe, unless you would bring my\n\n 5   attention to anything else that we've spoken about with\n\n 6   respect to the jury charge, the rest of the motion for\n\n 7   directed verdict will be denied.\n\n 8                    MS. GREER:    It is all I can think of\n\n 9   right now, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Keep your voice up, please.\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    That's all I can think of\n\n12   right now, Your Honor.\n\n13                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, I think we're\n\n14   ready to do the charge objections.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let's hear the charge\n\n16   objections.\n\n17                    (At the bench, on the record)\n\n18        DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT'S CHARGE\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Defendant\n\n20   makes its objections to the Court's charge in the\n\n21   presence of the Court and opposing counsel and the\n\n22   court reporter and before the charge has been read to\n\n23   the jury.\n\n24                    After we finish making our objections,\n\n25   Your Honor, we get a ruling, then we'll be tendering\n\f        TAB 41\n\nObjections to the Charge\n       (71:15-73)\n\f                                                             15\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                          COURT'S RULING\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    All right.   Then I will make\n\n 3   no ruling.\n\n 4                    And I believe, unless you would bring my\n\n 5   attention to anything else that we've spoken about with\n\n 6   respect to the jury charge, the rest of the motion for\n\n 7   directed verdict will be denied.\n\n 8                    MS. GREER:    It is all I can think of\n\n 9   right now, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Keep your voice up, please.\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    That's all I can think of\n\n12   right now, Your Honor.\n\n13                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, I think we're\n\n14   ready to do the charge objections.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let's hear the charge\n\n16   objections.\n\n17                    (At the bench, on the record)\n\n18        DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT'S CHARGE\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Defendant\n\n20   makes its objections to the Court's charge in the\n\n21   presence of the Court and opposing counsel and the\n\n22   court reporter and before the charge has been read to\n\n23   the jury.\n\n24                    After we finish making our objections,\n\n25   Your Honor, we get a ruling, then we'll be tendering\n\f                                                            16\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   requested instructions to the Court for the Court's\n\n 2   consideration.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n 4                    MS. YEATES:    Our first objection is to\n\n 5   the agency instructions and the preliminary\n\n 6   instructions in the charge, Your Honor.         Because those\n\n 7   instructions we believe erroneously include the\n\n 8   apparent authority theory.\n\n 9                    As Your Honor knows, we believe there's\n\n10   no pleading to support the apparent authority theory\n\n11   and there's been no trial by consent and there's no\n\n12   trial amendment.    So we believe that theory should not\n\n13   be in the charge and we object to including it in the\n\n14   charge.\n\n15                    Your Honor, I'll ask you to rule on all\n\n16   of them at the end, Your Honor.\n\n17                    THE COURT:    Oh, all right.\n\n18                    MS. YEATES:    We believe the apparent\n\n19   authority in the charge is erroneous as a matter of\n\n20   law, Your Honor, because with respect to CH2M Hill's\n\n21   actual authority, Zachry was undisputedly on notice of\n\n22   the limitations of that actual authority.\n\n23                    And under Douglass versus Panama, that\n\n24   means the apparent authority theory cannot apply in\n\n25   this case.\n\f                                                           17\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  We also object to instructing the jury\n\n 2   on apparent authority because the Port is a public\n\n 3   entity that can only contract --\n\n 4                  THE COURT:    Slow down a little bit.\n\n 5                  MS. YEATES:    Can only contract in\n\n 6   writing and therefore apparent authority cannot apply\n\n 7   as a matter of law.   I believe you've heard all these.\n\n 8                  Furthermore, Your Honor, inclusion of\n\n 9   the apparent authority theory will improperly allow the\n\n10   jury to believe that CH2M Hill --\n\n11                  THE COURT:    Ms. Yeates, you got to slow\n\n12   down just a little.\n\n13                  MS. YEATES:    Okay.   Well, I'm sorry,\n\n14   Your Honor, my team is anxious.\n\n15                  Inclusion of the apparent authority\n\n16   theory in the charge will improperly allow the jury to\n\n17   believe that CH2M Hill could have apparent authority\n\n18   based on some conduct by the Port that held CH2M Hill\n\n19   out as the Port's agent.\n\n20                  In order, you see, Your Honor, to allow\n\n21   -- so that Zachry can argue that they could recover\n\n22   additional work directed by the Port, which is the\n\n23   Texas 271 -- Section 271 of the government code\n\n24   standard.\n\n25                  THE COURT:    Local government code,\n\f                                                           18\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   right?\n\n 2                   MS. YEATES:    Right, Your Honor.   And I'm\n\n 3   bringing that to the Court's attention because that\n\n 4   demonstrates the harmful error in including apparent\n\n 5   authority instruction in the charge.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n 7                   MS. YEATES:    We also object, Your Honor,\n\n 8   to the instruction concerning the imputation of\n\n 9   knowledge, which is included in the Court's agency\n\n10   instructions.\n\n11                   That's the instruction that starts, A\n\n12   party's knowledge includes facts known to the party,\n\n13   etcetera.   The PJC authorizes no such instructions.     As\n\n14   Your Honor knows, we found no Texas case that\n\n15   authorizes such an instruction, and so we object to\n\n16   including it in the charge.\n\n17                   Your Honor, we also object to the\n\n18   absence from the charge of an instruction that an agent\n\n19   can be an agent for a party for one purpose but not\n\n20   other purposes.\n\n21                   That instruction is supported by the law\n\n22   and the evidence.   We don't believe it's submitted by\n\n23   implication from other instructions.     And the addition\n\n24   of that instruction is necessary in order for the\n\n25   Court's instructions on agency to be substantially\n\f                                                             19\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   correct.\n\n 2                    Because in this case, a central fact\n\n 3   issue presented is whether CH2M Hill was the Port's\n\n 4   agent for certain purposes but not the Port's agent for\n\n 5   other purposes.    In order properly to answer the\n\n 6   question, we believe the jury needs this instruction.\n\n 7                    At the conclusion of our objections, the\n\n 8   Port will tender Defendant's Requested Instruction No.\n\n 9   1, which would state that that other party may be\n\n10   authorized to act on behalf of a party for some\n\n11   purposes, while not being authorized to act on behalf\n\n12   of that party for other purposes.\n\n13                    And the Port objects to the omission\n\n14   from the Court's charge of that instruction.\n\n15                    The Port also objects to the omission\n\n16   from the charge, Your Honor, of an instruction charging\n\n17   the jury that in this case, authority for another to\n\n18   act for the Port can arise only from a written\n\n19   agreement made by the Port that allows the other party\n\n20   to act on behalf of and for the benefit of the Port.\n\n21                    And again, our argument there,\n\n22   Your Honor, is that the Port can only contract in\n\n23   writing, and therefore it could only can have an agent\n\n24   by writing.\n\n25                    The Port will be tendering Defendant's\n\f                                                          20\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Requested Instruction No. 2, which will state in this\n\n 2   case, authority for another to act for the Port can\n\n 3   arise only from a written agreement made by the Port\n\n 4   that allows the other party to act on behalf and for\n\n 5   the benefit of the Port.\n\n 6                 Furthermore, the Port objects to the\n\n 7   inclusion in the charge of apparent authority because\n\n 8   as a matter of law that theory cannot apply to the Port\n\n 9   given the Port's status as a governmental entity with\n\n10   governmental immunity, and so we object on that basis\n\n11   too, Your Honor.\n\n12                 Moving to the definition of New Zachry,\n\n13   Your Honor, that's in there because of Your Honor's\n\n14   pass-through ruling.\n\n15                 And obviously, we object to the ruling,\n\n16   Your Honor, and to -- well, I'll be objecting to those\n\n17   parts of the charge that go to the ruling because we\n\n18   believe that New Zachry is not the Plaintiff in the\n\n19   case and that Zachry does not have a valid pass-through\n\n20   claim for all the reasons that we argued in our motion\n\n21   to strike, which Your Honor overruled.\n\n22                 And principally, Your Honor, you'll\n\n23   remember that's because New Zachry was created and\n\n24   retained by Zachry to be the subcontractor only after\n\n25   the breach occurred and therefore the Port's breach\n\f                                                            21\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   could not have caused the damages to New Zachry in this\n\n 2   context.\n\n 3                   So we object to the New Zachry\n\n 4   definition, and we'll be objecting to the other\n\n 5   instructions on that basis.\n\n 6                   Your Honor, in your instructions, you\n\n 7   instruct multiple times concerning ambiguity and trade\n\n 8   custom.    We've talked about that.\n\n 9                   It's our belief that those instructions,\n\n10   because they appear multiple times in the charge,\n\n11   should be in the preliminary instructions one time in\n\n12   the front of the charge.\n\n13                   I'm particularly concerned about this\n\n14   with respect to trade/usage because it's our position\n\n15   that there is no evidence to raise a fact issue on the\n\n16   legal standard from when a trade custom or usage\n\n17   arises.\n\n18                   And that by instructing the jury\n\n19   multiple times on that, the Judge -- the Court\n\n20   improperly comments on the weight of the evidence by\n\n21   nudging or telling the jury that the Court thinks,\n\n22   Well, there must be a trade custom or usage because I'm\n\n23   asking about it several times in the charge.\n\n24                   And we believe that because the trade\n\n25   custom or usage relates to the ambiguity instruction,\n\f                                                             22\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   the proper thing to do would be to take the ambiguity\n\n 2   instruction and trade custom and usage and put them\n\n 3   both in the front of the charge.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:    Slow down.   If you want this\n\n 5   on the record, you've got to slow down.\n\n 6                    MS. YEATES:    Okay.\n\n 7                    And if you put it in the front of the\n\n 8   charge, Your Honor, you would lead the instruction by\n\n 9   saying, In answering questions that require you to\n\n10   decide the meaning of an agreement, you must decide the\n\n11   meaning by determining the intent of the parties at the\n\n12   time of the agreement, and then continue with the\n\n13   Court's instructions on ambiguity.\n\n14                    Your Honor, the Port further objects to\n\n15   the inclusion instruction in the charge on trade custom\n\n16   and usage because, as I've stated, Your Honor, there's\n\n17   no evidence to raise an issue on that.\n\n18                    Your Honor, I've talked about the\n\n19   ordering of the questions in the charge and we object\n\n20   to the fact that the charge does not have the excuse\n\n21   questions in each cluster following liability.\n\n22                    We think that's the appropriate, proper\n\n23   way to do it and we object to not doing it that way,\n\n24   Your Honor.\n\n25                    On Question No. 1, I think our only\n\f                                                           23\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   objection there at this point is that the Port is\n\n 2   charging the jury as to what the jury may consider in\n\n 3   deciding Question No. 1, and that's the ambiguity\n\n 4   instruction.   And again, we think that should be in the\n\n 5   front of the charge.\n\n 6                  Your Honor, moving to Question No. 2 --\n\n 7   oh, I'm sorry, also on Question No. 1, the Court\n\n 8   instructs the jury not to consider Section 5.10 with\n\n 9   respect to breach of 5.10.     And the Port objects to the\n\n10   Court giving that instruction.\n\n11                  THE COURT:    I thought we -- didn't we\n\n12   change that?\n\n13                  MS. YEATES:    No.   It's limited to\n\n14   breach, Your Honor.    But remember my position was it\n\n15   shouldn't be in there at all.\n\n16                  That's Ms. Greer's concern that there\n\n17   could be an irreconcilable conflict between the two\n\n18   findings.\n\n19                  THE COURT:    How -- did we change the\n\n20   wording of that though?     What question is it?\n\n21                  MS. YEATES:    It's Question 1.\n\n22                  MS. GREER:    1.\n\n23                  I think what you had in the draft last\n\n24   night was, In answering this question only, you're not\n\n25   being asked to decide whether the Port failed to comply\n\f                                                          24\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   with Section 5.10 of the contract.\n\n 2                   MS. YEATES:    And, you know,\n\n 3   Your Honor --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Question 1?\n\n 5                   MS. YEATES:    Right.     Well, that's\n\n 6   just --\n\n 7                   THE COURT:    Oh, yeah.     Yeah.\n\n 8                   MS. YEATES:    -- Ms. Greer's concern\n\n 9   about irreconcilable findings, Your Honor.\n\n10                   But we believe the instruction will\n\n11   mislead and confuse the jury into believing that the\n\n12   jury cannot consider Section 5.10 in determining\n\n13   whether the Port failed to comply with Change Order 4.\n\n14                   And we believe that's error, Your Honor,\n\n15   erroneous because Change Order 4 incorporates the rest\n\n16   of the contract to the extent the rest of the contract\n\n17   is not in conflict with Change Order 4.\n\n18                   Therefore, at the conclusion of these\n\n19   objections -- well, we object to having the instruction\n\n20   in there at all.\n\n21                   But at the inclusion of the objections,\n\n22   we'll be requesting Defendant's Requested Question No.\n\n23   3, which states, However, you may consider Section 5.10\n\n24   in determining whether the Port failed to comply with\n\n25   Change Order 4.    You may consider it in deciding\n\f                                                             25\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Question 1.\n\n 2                    And we think if you're going to give\n\n 3   that instruction that's in the charge, Your Honor, that\n\n 4   this additional instruction would also be required.\n\n 5                    And again, this is something we\n\n 6   discussed last night.\n\n 7                    MS. GREER:    Our response would be a\n\n 8   comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n 9                    MS. YEATES:    Right.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    What?\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    Our response to that\n\n12   argument was that it would be a comment on the weight\n\n13   of the evidence designed to nudge the jury.\n\n14                    And in fact, it would tell the jury to\n\n15   adopt the position that Section 2.02, Precedence\n\n16   Provision, as a matter of law does not cause Change\n\n17   Order 4 to trump the general conditions and the\n\n18   technical specifications, 5.10, all those.\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    And of course, our\n\n20   position, Your Honor, is if we're going to point the\n\n21   jury in the instruction you're giving and tell them not\n\n22   to consider whether 5.10 is breached, that that leads\n\n23   the jury to believe they're not supposed to look at\n\n24   5.10.\n\n25                    THE COURT:    I understand.\n\f                                                           26\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  MS. YEATES:   Okay.\n\n 2                  Your Honor, on the next instruction I\n\n 3   would like to go to under Question 1 is the instruction\n\n 4   that states, Furthermore, in answering this question\n\n 5   only, you are instructed that nothing in Section 5.41\n\n 6   gave the Port the right to issue its revise and\n\n 7   resubmit.\n\n 8                  We believe this instruction is erroneous\n\n 9   because it's based on an incorrect construction and\n\n10   interpretation of the contract.\n\n11                  It's not -- we don't believe it's a\n\n12   proper -- restatement of what the Court's ruling was\n\n13   intended to go to with respect to your ruling on the\n\n14   meaning of 5.41.\n\n15                  And we thought the Court's ruling was\n\n16   going to the point that Zachry was not required to\n\n17   obtain a written change directive or change order in\n\n18   order to recover.   And so we believe this instruction\n\n19   goes beyond what we thought the point of the Court's\n\n20   pretrial ruling was.\n\n21                  Furthermore, we believe it's erroneous\n\n22   as a matter of law as explained in all our previous\n\n23   objections to the Court's instructions concerning 5.41.\n\n24                  And the Court's instruction is based on\n\n25   the erroneous application, we believe, of the so-called\n\f                                                             27\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   radical change doctrine, and on the Shintech and\n\n 2   Columbia Gas line of cases.\n\n 3                    And we believe those are inapplicable\n\n 4   here because Section 3.09 of the contract, you'll\n\n 5   recall, provides that no action or failure to act by\n\n 6   the Port can constitute a waiver of a right of the Port\n\n 7   under the contract.\n\n 8                    Moreover, here, the Port didn't\n\n 9   relinquish its contractual procedural rights under\n\n10   Section 5.41 even in the event of a breach because the\n\n11   Port's procedural rights under 5.41 go directly to the\n\n12   breach issue, and that's the legal rationale of the\n\n13   Technip case that we've discussed.\n\n14                    I believe you've heard these arguments,\n\n15   Your Honor.\n\n16                    Also, under the Texas Water Code and\n\n17   other provisions of Texas law, the Port is statutorily\n\n18   prohibited from making any binding contract that's not\n\n19   in writing.    And that's exactly what Section 4.1 (sic)\n\n20   is going to when it says, If a contractor is going to\n\n21   do additional work, he has to get a written change\n\n22   order.\n\n23                    MS. GREER:    That's --\n\n24                    THE COURT:    4.1 or 5.41?\n\n25                    MS. YEATES:    I'm sorry, 5.41. I\n\f                                                           28\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   apologize, Your Honor.\n\n 2                  THE COURT:    I just wanted your record to\n\n 3   be clear.\n\n 4                  MS. YEATES:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 5                  Furthermore, the Court's instruction is\n\n 6   erroneous as a matter of law because the Port has\n\n 7   governmental immunity, which is waived only to the\n\n 8   extent permitted by Chapter 271 of the Texas Local\n\n 9   Government Code.\n\n10                  And we believe Section 5.41 goes\n\n11   directly to whether the amount sought by Zachry comes\n\n12   within that waiver of immunity.    The Shintech and\n\n13   Columbia Gas line of cases are not attempting to deal\n\n14   with the situation of governmental immunity.\n\n15                  Even if the radical change doctrine or\n\n16   the Shintech line of law applied, they would not make\n\n17   Section 5.41 relevant to whether the Port had the right\n\n18   to revise and resubmit.\n\n19                  We believe Section 5.41 does not go to\n\n20   that issue, and that is why we believe the instruction\n\n21   given in connection with Question No. 1 is erroneous as\n\n22   a matter of law.\n\n23                  And -- now, Your Honor, it also, the\n\n24   instruction on 5.41 also, we believe, constitutes an\n\n25   impermissible comment --\n\f                                                             29\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    THE COURT:    Slow down.\n\n 2                    MS. YEATES:    And impermissible comment\n\n 3   on the weight of the evidence serving to tilt or nudge\n\n 4   the jury to find in Zachry's favor.         And the\n\n 5   instruction, we believe, is not correct or helpful to\n\n 6   the jury.\n\n 7                    Your Honor, I would now like to, with\n\n 8   respect to Question 1, simply reurge our matter of law\n\n 9   arguments that we believe we've made to you previously\n\n10   on why the Port believes that it is correct as a matter\n\n11   of law that Change Order 1 didn't -- Change Order 4 did\n\n12   not entitle Zachry to use the frozen cutoff wall.\n\n13                    And we've argued all those things,\n\n14   Your Honor, in opposition to the Port's Rule 166(g)\n\n15   motion, and so I'm not going to repeat them here.      It's\n\n16   just a law argument.\n\n17                    Your Honor, on Question No. 2, we again,\n\n18   have the instruction on ambiguity and trade/usage.\n\n19   And again, we object to including it multiple times in\n\n20   the charge.\n\n21                    The Port objects to the instruction\n\n22   under Question No. 2 telling the jury that it may\n\n23   decide the meaning of Section 5.10 and 5.22 by\n\n24   considering trade usage or custom.\n\n25                    Your Honor, as you know, there's -- the\n\f                                                           30\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   PJC says it's not even clear, it's an appropriate\n\n 2   instruction in the charge.    And most importantly,\n\n 3   Zachry has not adduced evidence to meet the legal\n\n 4   standard to raise a fact issue on whether there's any\n\n 5   trade custom or usage.    So we would object on that\n\n 6   basis.\n\n 7                  We further object to this instruction\n\n 8   concerning 5.41 given in connection with Question 2.\n\n 9   We believe it's based on an incorrect construction and\n\n10   interpretation of the contract.    And therefore, is not\n\n11   a proper restatement of the Court's prior rulings with\n\n12   regard to Section 5.41.\n\n13                  We continue to assert all the\n\n14   objections, Your Honor, that we've made during trial to\n\n15   Your Honor's instructions with respect to Section 5.41.\n\n16                  Two hours of sleep last night.\n\n17                  MS. GREER:    Quit bragging.\n\n18                  (Laughing)\n\n19                  MS. YEATES:    And so I'm not going to\n\n20   repeat all of our arguments that I just made a minute\n\n21   ago about why the Shintech line doesn't support the\n\n22   ruling or why the radical change doctrine doesn't the\n\n23   ruling.   I won't repeat any of that.\n\n24                  And we believe again, that this\n\n25   instruction would be an impermissible and harmful\n\f                                                          31\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   comment on the weight, serving to tilt or nudge the\n\n 2   jury to find in favor of Zachry.\n\n 3                 And then I would like to go on now to\n\n 4   Question No. 3 on the statutory measure of damages, we\n\n 5   agree that Your Honor's instruction is correct, that\n\n 6   that is the statutory measure.\n\n 7                 Our objection here is we believe\n\n 8   Zachry's adduced no proof of amounts due and owing\n\n 9   under the contract.   That's our argument.\n\n10                 And therefore, I want to assert it here\n\n11   that we think it's error to ask Question No. 3 because\n\n12   we believe Zachry has no evidence to raise a fact issue\n\n13   that would allow the submission of the statutory\n\n14   measure of damages.\n\n15                 Your Honor, we also with respect to the\n\n16   statutory measure of damages, Subpart B in the\n\n17   instruction under Question No. 3, the Port objects\n\n18   because, among other reasons, outside of the written\n\n19   executed change order, the Port cannot direct work for\n\n20   Zachry -- cannot direct Zachry to do additional work.\n\n21                 And there is no evidence that Zachry was\n\n22   directed by the Port to do additional work.   And\n\n23   therefore, we object to the submission of the second\n\n24   prong of Section 271 because we think there's no\n\n25   evidence to raise the issue and there's no evidence of\n\f                                                          32\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   a written executed change order.\n\n 2                 Your Honor, now we come to the\n\n 3   pass-through instructions and I'm not going to repeat\n\n 4   all the arguments we made before, Your Honor, but\n\n 5   obviously, we believe the pass-through instruction,\n\n 6   which is the instruction under Question 3, telling the\n\n 7   jury that they should include reimbursable costs\n\n 8   incurred by New Zachry.\n\n 9                 We believe that instruction is improper\n\n10   because we don't think there is a valid -- legally\n\n11   valid, pass-through claim in this case for all the\n\n12   reasons we stated in our motion to strike the\n\n13   pass-through claim.\n\n14                 Your Honor, we also object to the way --\n\n15   telling the jury in the pass-through instruction that\n\n16   the jury should include reimbursable costs.\n\n17                 We believe that that's an impermissible\n\n18   comment on the weight, nudging the jury to find for\n\n19   Zachry and we think it should say the jury may include\n\n20   reimbursable costs.\n\n21                 To make the instruction correct, the\n\n22   Court would need to add the following sentence at the\n\n23   end of the instruction.\n\n24                 THE COURT:    This is question?\n\n25                 MS. YEATES:    This is Question 3, the\n\f                                                          33\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   pass-through instruction.\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let me get there.\n\n 3                    MS. YEATES:    The instruction that we\n\n 4   think would have to be added is, You may include such\n\n 5   reimbursable costs only to the extent that Zachry\n\n 6   agreed, in the management service agreement, to pay New\n\n 7   Zachry such reimbursable costs.\n\n 8                    At the conclusion of the objections,\n\n 9   Your Honor, I'll request that instruction as\n\n10   Defendant's Requested Instruction No. 4.\n\n11                    And we believe omitting that instruction\n\n12   makes the pass-through instruction legally defective\n\n13   and erroneous as a matter of law because the\n\n14   fundamental premise of a pass-through claim is that the\n\n15   Plaintiff asserting the claim has to prove the\n\n16   liability of that Plaintiff contractor to the\n\n17   subcontractor.\n\n18                    And we believe that's what our requested\n\n19   instruction goes to.\n\n20                    Your Honor, you have instructions on\n\n21   Section 5.41, 5.42 and 5.52 and that's under Question 3\n\n22   and that's the instruction which begins, You are\n\n23   instructed that Zachry was not required to take certain\n\n24   actions.\n\n25                    We believe the instruction is incorrect\n\f                                                             34\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   as a matter of law.    I'm going to separately object to\n\n 2   this on 5.40 -- as to the extent it goes to 5.41, on\n\n 3   the one hand, 5.52, on the other hand and 5.42, on the\n\n 4   other hand.\n\n 5                    The Port continues to assert and does\n\n 6   not waive all the objections that we've previously\n\n 7   raised to the Court's instructions concerning -- given\n\n 8   to the jury already -- concerning 5.41.\n\n 9                    And for all the reasons I've already\n\n10   articulated, Your Honor, concerning how the radical\n\n11   change doctrine doesn't apply, Shintech line of cases\n\n12   doesn't apply, all those arguments I've already made as\n\n13   to why we believe Your Honor's ruling on Section 5.41\n\n14   is in error, we believe all those reasons make the\n\n15   instructions with respect to this instruction also in\n\n16   error.\n\n17                    And we believe the instructions and\n\n18   impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence,\n\n19   the effect would be to tilt or nudge the jury to find\n\n20   for Zachry.\n\n21                    The Court's instruction concerning 5.41\n\n22   not requiring a written change order is particularly\n\n23   harmful to the Port because the measure of damages in\n\n24   the charge allows the jury to recover for additional\n\n25   work that Zachry was directed to perform.\n\f                                                          35\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                 And under Section 5.41 the requirement\n\n 2   of a written change order before the contractor is\n\n 3   entitled to be paid for additional work is precisely\n\n 4   what Section 5.41 is designed to require.   And so that\n\n 5   is why we believe the instruction and the Court's\n\n 6   ruling with respect to 5.41 is harmful error in the\n\n 7   case.\n\n 8                 And we also believe Your Honor's already\n\n 9   charged the jury with respect to what they should\n\n10   consider on 5.41 and that they should not be charged in\n\n11   this instruction again.\n\n12                 Your Honor, with respect to your\n\n13   instruction on 5.52, here under Question 3, it applies\n\n14   5.52 to the extent 5.52 makes requirements consistent\n\n15   with Section 5.41.\n\n16                 And so, therefore, we would just say all\n\n17   of the same objections that we asserted against the\n\n18   instruction on 5.41 also apply with respect to 5.42\n\n19   (sic).\n\n20                 And now that takes me to the objections\n\n21   with respect to the instruction on Section 5.42.     And\n\n22   the Port objects to those instructions because again,\n\n23   Your Honor, we believe the Court's ruling on Section\n\n24   5.42 is erroneous as a matter of law.\n\n25                 We've already explained that we think\n\f                                                          36\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   the radical change doctrine doesn't apply to 5.42.     And\n\n 2   we believe that 5.42 is not invalid under Section\n\n 3   16.071 of the Remedies Code because it's not the kind\n\n 4   of notice provision that comes within that section\n\n 5   under the American Airlines case.   And nor does\n\n 6   Shintech or Columbia Gas line of cases make 5.42\n\n 7   inapplicable in this case.\n\n 8                  So we, for all the reasons we previously\n\n 9   have asserted in our objections to Your Honor's\n\n10   instructions given to the jury on Section 5.42, we\n\n11   object to this instruction on 5.42 included in the\n\n12   Court's charge under Question No. 3.\n\n13                  Your Honor, your -- the sentence that\n\n14   you have in the instruction that says, You are\n\n15   instructed that the jury may consider Sections 5.41,\n\n16   5.42 and 5.52 with respect to assessing a party's state\n\n17   of mind, we believe that that instruction repeats what\n\n18   Your Honor has said during trial.\n\n19                  To the extent the instruction has been\n\n20   expanded to include 5.52, we would just assert against\n\n21   that instruction, Your Honor, all of the objections\n\n22   that we previously have made to Your Honor's\n\n23   instruction given during trial with respect to the\n\n24   instruction.\n\n25                  However -- I think I know where Jenny is\n\f                                                          37\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   going -- we believe the instruction needs to be in the\n\n 2   charge because of the Court's previous instruction\n\n 3   given on these provisions under Question 3.\n\n 4                  And having decided to instruct the jury\n\n 5   under Question 3 with respect to what 5.41, 5.42 and\n\n 6   5.52 do not require Zachry to do to recover damages.\n\n 7   We do believe it's necessary at this point for\n\n 8   Your Honor to repeat the instruction.\n\n 9                  My problem is, the instruction that Your\n\n10   Honor has given earlier, we objected to because we\n\n11   think it's based on an erroneous ruling -- reading and\n\n12   interpretation and error of law as to those sections --\n\n13                  MS. GREER:    You're saying you only\n\n14   requested that instruction about state of mind because\n\n15   the Judge is putting in the first instruction --\n\n16                  MS. YEATES:    Right.   Right.   It's\n\n17   necessary in the charge because of the first\n\n18   instruction.\n\n19                  MS. GREER:    Okay.\n\n20                  MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, on the NDFD\n\n21   exceptions, no damages for delay exceptions,\n\n22   Your Honor, we object to submitting to the jury the\n\n23   instructions concerning those exceptions to the no\n\n24   damages for delay or hindrance provision.\n\n25                  Specifically, those are the instructions\n\f                                                           38\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   concerning arbitrary and capricious conduct, bad faith,\n\n 2   etcetera.   Your Honor, Texas doesn't recognize these\n\n 3   common law exceptions, and we believe that even if\n\n 4   Texas did recognize those exceptions, the language of\n\n 5   this particular Section 5.07, no damages for delay\n\n 6   clause would preclude application of those exceptions.\n\n 7                  And there is no evidence and no legally\n\n 8   insufficient evidence of damages resulting from a delay\n\n 9   or hindrance that could of possibly have been caused by\n\n10   any conduct, egregious conduct of the Port constituting\n\n11   arbitrary and capricious conduct, bad faith, active\n\n12   interference or fraud as defined in the Court's charge\n\n13   under Question No. 3.\n\n14                  Also, Your Honor, and I mentioned this\n\n15   to you in the informal charge conference, Your Honor,\n\n16   we object to the instruction concerning the no damages\n\n17   for delay provision, Section 5.07 because that\n\n18   instruction omits the requirement that the Port -- any\n\n19   egregious conduct of the Port, arbitrary and\n\n20   capricious, bad faith, active interference or fraud,\n\n21   that that conduct must be the sole cause of any delay\n\n22   or hindrance damages.\n\n23                  A major fact issue in this case is who\n\n24   caused Zachry to be delayed so behind schedule?   If --\n\n25   we believe, under the law, Your Honor, if the delay was\n\f                                                            39\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   also caused by Zachry, then that delay, even if\n\n 2   contributed to by the Port's alleged egregious conduct,\n\n 3   cannot constitute an exception to the no damages for\n\n 4   delay or hindrance provision.\n\n 5                   We believe the Court's instructions are\n\n 6   defective because they incorrectly omit the sole cause\n\n 7   requirement.\n\n 8                   To correct that omission, the language\n\n 9   in the Court's instruction under Question 3 should be\n\n10   modified so that the language refers to a delay or\n\n11   hindrance that was solely the result of the Port's\n\n12   actions, if any, that constituted arbitrary and\n\n13   capricious conduct, etcetera.\n\n14                   And we object to the omission of the\n\n15   word solely in the Court's instruction under Question\n\n16   No. 3.\n\n17                   Your Honor, with respect to the active\n\n18   interference definition in Question No. 3, the Port\n\n19   objects to that instruction defining active\n\n20   interference because the instruction omits the words\n\n21   taken to before the words unreasonably interfere.\n\n22                   We believe the instruction should\n\n23   properly be worded, Active interference means\n\n24   affirmative, willful action taken to unreasonably\n\n25   interfere.\n\f                                                           40\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  We believe those words are necessary\n\n 2   because to constitute active interference, a party has\n\n 3   to intend to interfere.\n\n 4                  MS. GREER:    Wait a second.   I thought\n\n 5   you agreed that it would be to interfere if you got the\n\n 6   second sentence of that instruction.     That it would be\n\n 7   that unreasonably interferes -- let me get back to my\n\n 8   question.\n\n 9                  I thought the agreement was that you\n\n10   would not object to active interference means\n\n11   affirmative, willful action that unreasonably\n\n12   interferes with the other party's compliance with the\n\n13   contract.   You would agree to that, if the Judge\n\n14   submitted active interference requires more than a\n\n15   simple mistake, error in judgment, lack of total\n\n16   effort, or lack of complete diligence.\n\n17                  MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the first\n\n18   sentence, as stated, allows an act that we didn't\n\n19   intend to be interference to constitute interference\n\n20   without scienter intention, and so I have to object to\n\n21   that.   I can't let that -- no, I object to that.\n\n22                  Your Honor, the fraud definition\n\n23   includes recklessness in Question No. 3.      Your Honor,\n\n24   we talked about this in our informal charge conference.\n\n25                  Our position is that under Texas law\n\f                                                          41\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   from the Texas Supreme Court, fraud, as a promise with\n\n 2   no intent to perform, can only be intentional fraud;\n\n 3   and therefore, we believe it's error to include the\n\n 4   reckless fraud instruction in that question.\n\n 5                 Now, we turn to Question No. 4, and,\n\n 6   Your Honor, we asked for this question, we believe it\n\n 7   should be in the charge under Casteel.    I'm just\n\n 8   pointing out that the only reason we asked for it is\n\n 9   because Your Honor is allowing Zachry to submit the\n\n10   pass-through damages.\n\n11                 And I don't want my failure to object to\n\n12   that question to somehow waive my argument that we\n\n13   believe there's no valid pass-through claim in that\n\n14   case.\n\n15                 Similarly, Your Honor, with respect to\n\n16   the break out question, I believe I just talked about\n\n17   the pass-through, that's actually break out question --\n\n18   it's Question No. 5.    But I have a similar point to\n\n19   make on Question No. 4, the break out question for\n\n20   delay or hindrance.\n\n21                 We asked for that question but I don't\n\n22   want -- we need it because Your Honor has included\n\n23   delay or hindrance in the damages, but obviously, we\n\n24   don't waive our position that delay or hindrance\n\n25   damages are just not recoverable as a matter of law by\n\f                                                          42\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   asking Your Honor to give the break out instruction\n\n 2   that -- that breaks out under Casteel the dollars that\n\n 3   represent the delay or hindrance damages.\n\n 4                 Your Honor, I now want to turn to\n\n 5   Question No. 6, Subsection D, the release instruction,\n\n 6   which again includes the ambiguity and trade custom or\n\n 7   usage.\n\n 8                 Again, we object to repeating these\n\n 9   instructions over and over again in the charge.       And\n\n10   particularly with respect to the releases, Your Honor,\n\n11   that we do not believe there's any evidence to raise\n\n12   the legal standard for what constitutes a trade custom\n\n13   or industry usage.     And we believe it's an improper\n\n14   comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n15                 With respect to Question No. 8, which is\n\n16   Zachry's counter-defenses, Your Honor, we talked about\n\n17   this last night.     We believe that the waiver\n\n18   instruction, because this is waiver of fraud, should\n\n19   require an additional instruction that would say, With\n\n20   respect to fraud, waiver requires full knowledge of the\n\n21   fraud, and all material facts, and must be made with\n\n22   the intention, clearly manifested, of abiding by the\n\n23   contract and waiving all right to assert deception.\n\n24                 And so we'll be requesting that,\n\n25   Your Honor, as Requested Instruction No. 5.       Because we\n\f                                                          43\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   believe that's necessary to make the definition correct\n\n 2   with respect to waiver of fraud.\n\n 3                 On quasi-estoppel the Port objects to\n\n 4   Question No. 8 to the extent that it inquires whether\n\n 5   the Port is barred from asserting fraud in the\n\n 6   inducement because of quasi-estoppel.\n\n 7                 We believe as a matter of law, the\n\n 8   doctrine of quasi-estoppel does not apply to bar the\n\n 9   defense of fraudulent inducement.   It cannot be, as a\n\n10   matter of law, that it's unconscionable for a party to\n\n11   assert that it was defrauded.\n\n12                 The Port further objects to the\n\n13   instruction on quasi-estoppel given in connection with\n\n14   Question 8 because it fails to tell the jury that the\n\n15   party to be estopped must have taken its previous\n\n16   position with full knowledge of the fraud and all\n\n17   material facts.\n\n18                 We'll be tendering Defendant's Requested\n\n19   Instruction No. 6, which would state that with respect\n\n20   to the fraud, the prior position previously taken by\n\n21   the party to be estopped must have been taken with full\n\n22   knowledge of the fraud and all material facts and must\n\n23   have been taken with the intention, clearly manifested,\n\n24   of abiding by the contract and not asserting the other\n\n25   party's deception.\n\f                                                             44\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    And we object to the omission of this\n\n 2   sentence from the instruction on quasi-estoppel.\n\n 3                    Finally, Your Honor, with respect to\n\n 4   ratification in the charge, the instruction concerning\n\n 5   ratification in Question 8 states -- refers to the\n\n 6   Port.\n\n 7                    With respect to the counter-defense, the\n\n 8   Port is not making an affirmative claim for fraud.       And\n\n 9   so at the end of that instruction on ratification it\n\n10   currently says, All right to recover for the deception,\n\n11   and what we were doing is asserting a defense.\n\n12                    And so we think it should say, All right\n\n13   to assert the deception, and not all right to recover\n\n14   for the deception since we're not seeking to recover\n\n15   for the deception.\n\n16                    MS. GREER:    Your Honor, we would need to\n\n17   change that because Ms. Yeates dictated that\n\n18   instruction to you yesterday for what would be an\n\n19   appropriate instruction for ratification, so we would\n\n20   agree that that should go in there then --\n\n21                    MS. YEATES:    And I apologize for this,\n\n22   Your Honor, we caught this in the middle of the night\n\n23   last night.    And I think --\n\n24                    THE COURT:    So which question?\n\n25                    MS. GREER:    Question No. 8.\n\f                                                            45\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                   MS. YEATES:    Question 8, ratification,\n\n 2   Subsection C.   We believe it should say, All right to\n\n 3   assert the deception, not all right to recover for the\n\n 4   deception.\n\n 5                   And I'm nearly finished, Your Honor.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:    Wait.   Waiving all right to\n\n 7   assert?\n\n 8                   MS. YEATES:    Assert the deception.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:    Assert the thought?\n\n10                   MS. YEATES:    Assert the deception.\n\n11                   THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n12                   MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Port\n\n13   further objects to the instruction concerning\n\n14   quasi-estoppel because we believe it's wrong and that\n\n15   if fails to tell the jury -- I did that?      Okay.\n\n16                   And then on Question No. 9 -- oh, we did\n\n17   that already.\n\n18                   Your Honor, on Question No. 11 in the\n\n19   Court's charge, the excuse question, we've objected to\n\n20   instructing multiple times in the charge on ambiguity\n\n21   and trade custom, so we object again here to that.\n\n22                   And the Port -- now, I want to turn to\n\n23   Question No. 12.   The question that tells the jury --\n\n24   oh, this is the instruction in the Court's charge and\n\n25   Your Honor's directed verdict that the Court has\n\f                                                            46\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   determined that the Port failed to comply with the\n\n 2   contract by failing to pay.\n\n 3                   And I just want to make the point there,\n\n 4   Your Honor, that obviously, we disagree with the\n\n 5   Court's ruling that you made on Sections 5.05 and 5.06.\n\n 6   And so we have to object to that instruction, and we do\n\n 7   object.\n\n 8                   MS. GREER:    My understanding is you\n\n 9   don't object to the fact that he is giving the\n\n10   instruction, only to the fact --\n\n11                   MS. YEATES:    I object to the ruling\n\n12   giving rise to the instruction --\n\n13                   MS. GREER:    Exactly.\n\n14                   MS. YEATES:    -- and the instruction\n\n15   wouldn't be in the charge but for the ruling.        And but\n\n16   for that ruling, Your Honor, we would be submitting --\n\n17   Your Honor would be submitting in the charge failure to\n\n18   comply questions and damages questions.\n\n19                   MS. GREER:    But given his ruling, it's\n\n20   an appropriate way to open the -- the excuse question.\n\n21                   MS. YEATES:    Okay.     Your Honor, the Port\n\n22   objects --\n\n23                   MS. GREER:    Is that correct?\n\n24                   MS. YEATES:    Your Honor -- Jenny, I'm\n\n25   not required to stipulate what you want me to say.\n\f                                                           47\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  The Port objects to instructing the jury\n\n 2   -- I didn't object on that basis, you're okay.\n\n 3                  The Port objects to instructing the jury\n\n 4   in connection with Question 12 on trade custom and\n\n 5   usage for the same reasons I've said, Your Honor --\n\n 6                  THE COURT:    Slow down.\n\n 7                  MS. YEATES:    -- and so I won't repeat\n\n 8   them.   The repetition objection and the no evidence to\n\n 9   raise trade custom.\n\n10                  Your Honor, can I get a ruling on all of\n\n11   my objections, are they all overruled?\n\n12                         COURT'S RULING\n\n13                  THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n14                  MS. YEATES:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n15                  And at the conclusion of the objections,\n\n16   I now need to request and hand to Your Honor\n\n17   Defendant's Requested No. 1 -- Defendant's Requested\n\n18   Instructions No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and 6.     All of which\n\n19   we discussed in our objections, Your Honor.\n\n20                  And I tender them to Your Honor for\n\n21   ruling and ask Your Honor, If you are going to refuse\n\n22   them, Your Honor, if you would mark them refused and\n\n23   sign each copy for me?\n\n24                  THE COURT:    Okay.   I am refusing these\n\n25\n\f                                                            48\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   instructions.    I am marking them refused and signing\n\n 2   them and they will be made part of the record.\n\n 3                   MS. YEATES:     Okay.    And, Your Honor,\n\n 4   could we be permitted to take them to the clerk to be\n\n 5   filed or would you get them . . .\n\n 6                   THE COURT:    She was here.     I will hand\n\n 7   them to Veronica, our clerk, as soon as she comes back\n\n 8   and I will ask her to file them and also I will ask her\n\n 9   to give copies to both sides.\n\n10                   MS. YEATES:     Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n11                   MS. GREER:    Your Honor, may I speak?\n\n12                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n13                   Oh, Carolyn, do you need a break?        You\n\n14   okay?\n\n15                   THE REPORTER:     No, I'm fine.\n\n16                   THE COURT:    Okay.     Just go slow.\n\n17           PLAINTIFF'S OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT'S CHARGE\n\n18                   MS. GREER:    Your Honor, Zachry\n\n19   Construction Corporation --\n\n20                   THE COURT:    Wait.     I tell you what, move\n\n21   this way and speak louder, please.\n\n22                   MS. YEATES:     Here, let's change places.\n\n23                   MS. GREER:    Your Honor, Zachry\n\n24   Construction Corporation, in the presence of the Court,\n\n25   opposing counsel and before the jury charge has been\n\f                                                          49\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   read to the jury, presents the following objections to\n\n 2   the Court's charge.\n\n 3                 First, in the admonitory instructions,\n\n 4   Zachry is entitled to instruction that states, A\n\n 5   party's knowledge includes knowledge of facts that the\n\n 6   party acting with the other party's authority has\n\n 7   reason to know and that are material to the duties of\n\n 8   the party acting with the other party's authority.\n\n 9                 This is from the Restatement of Third of\n\n10   agency, Section 5.03.   And the Williams versus Jennings\n\n11   case, 755 S.W.2d 874, 883, that's Houston.   1988, writ\n\n12   denied.\n\n13                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n14   Proposed Issue No. 1 on this issue.\n\n15                 With respect to Question No. 1\n\n16   pertaining to Change Order 4, Zachry would object that\n\n17   Change Order 4 unambiguously includes an agreement that\n\n18   Zachry could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied\n\n19   in the September 9, 2005 design.\n\n20                 Accordingly, the issue of the proper\n\n21   interpretation of Change Order 4 should not be\n\n22   submitted to the jury, instead the jury should be\n\n23   instructed as to its meaning.\n\n24                 Specifically, the jury should be\n\n25   instructed in the Court's Question No. 1, You are\n\f                                                          50\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   instructed that Change Order 4 includes an agreement\n\n 2   that Zachry could use the frozen cutoff wall design\n\n 3   embodied in the September 9, 2005 design.\n\n 4                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n 5   Proposed Issue No. 2 on the proper interpretation of\n\n 6   Change Order 4.\n\n 7                 Furthermore, if the Court does not\n\n 8   instruct the jury that Change Order 4 includes an\n\n 9   agreement that Zachry could use the frozen cutoff wall\n\n10   design embodied in the September 9, 2005 design, then\n\n11   the jury should be instructed that if they agree with\n\n12   that interpretation, then the general conditions and\n\n13   technical specifications give the Port no right to\n\n14   issue its October 11, 2009 (sic) response.\n\n15                 As a matter of law, if the jury finds\n\n16   that the Port agreed in Change Order 4 that Zachry\n\n17   could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied in the\n\n18   September 9, 2005 design, then under the order of\n\n19   precedence provision of the contract, change orders\n\n20   take precedence over general conditions and technical\n\n21   specifications.   That's General Conditions Section\n\n22   2.02(a).\n\n23                 The general conditions therefore could\n\n24   not give the Port the right to issue the October 11,\n\n25   2005 response with respect to a design that it had\n\f                                                          51\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   already agreed to in Change Order 4.\n\n 2                 The Port (sic) should therefore instruct\n\n 3   the jury, If you find that Change Order 4 included in\n\n 4   agreement that Zachry could use the frozen cutoff wall\n\n 5   design embodied in the September 9, 2005 design, then\n\n 6   in answering this question only, you are instructed\n\n 7   that nothing in the general conditions or the technical\n\n 8   specifications of the contract including but not\n\n 9   limited to General Conditions Section 5.22, 5.41, 5.42\n\n10   and 5.52, gave the Port the right to issue its October\n\n11   11, 2005 response to the September 9, 2005 frozen\n\n12   cutoff wall design.\n\n13                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n14   Proposed Issue No. 3 on this issue.\n\n15                 Alternatively, Zachry would be entitled,\n\n16   consistent with this Court's prior rulings concerning\n\n17   the exclusion of Section 5.42 and 5.52 as well as their\n\n18   inapplicability on their face as a matter of law, to\n\n19   create a right in the Port to issue the October 11,\n\n20   2009 (sic) response.\n\n21                 Zachry would be entitled to an\n\n22   instruction that adds Section 5.42 and 5.52 to the\n\n23   instruction that the Court is already giving the jury,\n\n24   such that the instruction would now say, In answering\n\n25   this question, you are instructed that nothing in\n\f                                                             52\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Section 5.41, 5.42 or 5.52 gave the Port the right to\n\n 2   issue its October 11, 2005 response to the September 9,\n\n 3   2005 frozen cutoff wall design.\n\n 4                    Zachry objects to the absence of this\n\n 5   instruction, and will tender a proposed instruction\n\n 6   separately.    It will be Proposed Issue No. 4.\n\n 7                    Although Zachry has proposed that the\n\n 8   prior instructions be included in the Court's Question\n\n 9   No. 1, because that is how the Court has stated it will\n\n10   submit Change Order 4 issues.\n\n11                    Zachry believes the issues of the proper\n\n12   interpretation of Change Order 4 and the failure to\n\n13   comply with Change Order 4 should be submitted\n\n14   separately, rather than in one question as submitted by\n\n15   the Court, for the reasons discussed below.\n\n16                    Doing so would simplify the issues and\n\n17   make clear to the jury that there are two separate\n\n18   questions, interpretation and breach, that the jury\n\n19   should answer.\n\n20                    Zachry will separately tender a proposed\n\n21   instruction on these questions.    They will be Proposed\n\n22   Instructions Nos. 5 and 6.\n\n23                    Furthermore, combining the\n\n24   interpretation and failure to comply issues into one\n\n25   question obscures the basis for the jury's answers.\n\f                                                          53\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   That is, Zachry contends that the unambiguous language\n\n 2   of Change Order 4 includes an agreement that Zachry\n\n 3   could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied in the\n\n 4   September 9, 2005 design.\n\n 5                 Zachry has also proven as a matter of\n\n 6   law that the Port breached its agreement that Zachry\n\n 7   could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied in the\n\n 8   September 9, 2005 design.\n\n 9                 And so the issue of whether the Port\n\n10   failed to comply with Change Order 4 should not be\n\n11   submitted either.\n\n12                 If the jury answers no to the Court's\n\n13   Question No. 1, the Court of Appeals will not be able\n\n14   to determine whether one, the jury rejected Zachry's\n\n15   interpretation but found that the Port did not breach\n\n16   Change Order 4, or two, accepted Zachry's\n\n17   interpretation but found that the Port did not breach\n\n18   Change Order 4.\n\n19                 By combining an invalid question, the\n\n20   interpretation of Change Order 4, which should be\n\n21   decided as a matter of law by the Court, with a\n\n22   separate question, whether that agreement was breached,\n\n23   which also should be decided as a matter of law by the\n\n24   Court, the charge obscures the basis for the jury's\n\n25   decision, thus preventing the appellate court from\n\f                                                             54\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   determining whether the jury based its verdict on an\n\n 2   improperly submitted ground.\n\n 3                    This is the Crown Life versus Casteel\n\n 4   case, 22 S.W.3d 378, pinpoint 390.    Under Casteel, when\n\n 5   there is uncertainty as to the legal or evidentiary\n\n 6   validity of a jury issue, the issue should be submitted\n\n 7   separately.\n\n 8                    That's Casteel and also Harris County\n\n 9   versus Smith, 96 S.W.3d 230, pinpoint 236.    Where the\n\n10   Court said, And in a case such as this one, asking the\n\n11   jury to record its verdict as to each element of\n\n12   damages when there is doubt as to the legal sufficiency\n\n13   of the evidence will permit the losing party to\n\n14   preserve error without complicating the charge or the\n\n15   jury's deliberation.\n\n16                    Now, moving to Question No. 2 regarding\n\n17   breach of Section 5.10.    As a matter of law, nothing in\n\n18   the unambiguous language of Section 5.10 gave the Port\n\n19   the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n20                    The jury should therefore be instructed\n\n21   in Question No. 2 that nothing in Section 5.10 gave the\n\n22   Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n23   The jury should not be instructed to determine the\n\n24   meaning of Section 5.10.\n\n25                    Zachry will separately request its\n\f                                                          55\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Proposed Issue No. 7 on this issue.\n\n 2                 As a matter of law, nothing in the\n\n 3   unambiguous language of Section 5.22 gave the Port the\n\n 4   right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n 5                 The jury should therefore be instructed\n\n 6   in Question No. 2 that nothing in Section 5.22 gave the\n\n 7   Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n 8   The jury should not be instructed to determine the\n\n 9   meaning of Section 5.22.\n\n10                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n11   Proposed Issue No. 8 on this issue.\n\n12                 The burden of proof with respect to the\n\n13   Port's right to issue its October 11, 2005 response\n\n14   under Section 5.22 is erroneously placed on Zachry.\n\n15                 Section 5.22 is an affirmative defense\n\n16   in which the Port bears the burden of proof.\n\n17                 THE COURT:   Slow down.\n\n18                 MS. GREER:   Sorry.\n\n19                 Texas law is clear that, quote --\n\n20                 THE COURT:   Not that slow.\n\n21                 MS. GREER:   Huh?\n\n22                 THE COURT:   Not that slow.\n\n23                 MS. GREER:   Okay.    I'm running out of\n\n24   steam.\n\n25                 Quote, the burden of proving the\n\f                                                          56\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   happening of a contingency which, by the terms of the\n\n 2   contract, would discharge the party from liability or\n\n 3   any default or refusal to perform on the Plaintiff that\n\n 4   would excuse the performance of the Defendant, is on\n\n 5   the party who seeks to avoid the contract or excuse a\n\n 6   failure to perform it on that ground.\n\n 7                 That's the Howell versus Kelly case from\n\n 8   the 1st Court of Appeals in Houston, 534 S.W.2d 737,\n\n 9   pinpoint 739 to Page 740.\n\n10                 And then from the 14th Court of Appeals\n\n11   case, the Johnson versus McKinney American, Inc. --\n\n12   I'll give you this.\n\n13                 9 S.W.3d 271, Page 280.   The jury charge\n\n14   erroneously places the burden on Zachry to disprove the\n\n15   Port's right to issue its October 11, 2005 revise and\n\n16   resubmit under Section 5.22.\n\n17                 The Section 5.22 should be submitted as\n\n18   an excuse question, placing the burden of proof on the\n\n19   Port.\n\n20                 Alternatively, if the Court refuses to\n\n21   ask about Section 5.22 separately from Section 5.10, as\n\n22   in the Court's charge, the placement of the burden on\n\n23   the Port should be accomplished by instruction.\n\n24                 In Question No. 2, Zachry is entitled,\n\n25   consistent with the Court's prior rulings concerning\n\f                                                          57\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   the exclusion of Section 5.42 and Section 5.52, as well\n\n 2   as their inapplicability on their face as a matter of\n\n 3   law to create a right in the Port to issue the October\n\n 4   11, 2009 (sic) response.\n\n 5                 Zachry is entitled to an instruction\n\n 6   that adds Section 5.42 and 5.52 to the instructions the\n\n 7   Court is already giving the jury.     Such that it would\n\n 8   say, In answering this question, you're instructed that\n\n 9   nothing in Section 5.41, 5.42 or 5.52 gave the Port the\n\n10   right to issue its October 11, 2005 response to the\n\n11   September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff wall design.\n\n12                 Zachry objects to the absence of this\n\n13   instruction, and Zachry will separately request its\n\n14   Proposed Issue No. 9 on this issue.\n\n15                 Furthermore, the issue of Section 5.10\n\n16   and Section 5.22 should be submitted separately.     By\n\n17   combining the Port's affirmative defense under Section\n\n18   5.22 as Zachry's affirmative claim under Section 5.10,\n\n19   the jury charge obscures the basis for the jury's\n\n20   answer.\n\n21                 Zachry has strong arguments as to why as\n\n22   a matter of law the unambiguous language of Section\n\n23   5.10 and Section 5.22 gave the Port no right to issue\n\n24   its revise and resubmit response.\n\n25                 As well as why the Port's October 11,\n\f                                                          58\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   2005 -- 9 -- 5, 2005 response violated Section 5.10 and\n\n 2   Section 5.22 as a matter of law.     And the contract.\n\n 3                 Because Zachry's claim for breach of\n\n 4   Section 5.10 is combined with the Port's affirmative\n\n 5   defense under Section 5.22, and because the question of\n\n 6   the proper interpretation and breach of these clauses\n\n 7   is part of a single question, the charge obscures the\n\n 8   basis for the jury's decision.\n\n 9                 Thus preventing the appellate court from\n\n10   determining whether the jury based its verdict on an\n\n11   improperly submitted ground.     This is again, the\n\n12   Casteel case I cited earlier and Harris County versus\n\n13   Smith.\n\n14                 It will be difficult to show on appeal,\n\n15   if the jury answers no to Question No. 3 -- Question\n\n16   No. 2, whether it did so based on its interpretation of\n\n17   Section 5.10 or 5.22 or whether it believed there was a\n\n18   right to revise -- issue a revise and resubmit, but\n\n19   that it was not shown that the Port had no reasonable\n\n20   basis on which to exercise that right.\n\n21                 Question No. 3, damages for breach of\n\n22   contract with respect to the frozen cutoff wall breach.\n\n23   Zachry objects to the instruction that you may consider\n\n24   amounts, if any, owed as compensation for increased\n\n25   cost to perform the work as a direct result of\n\f                                                          59\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Port-caused delays, if any.\n\n 2                 Only if you find that such increased\n\n 3   costs were a natural, probable and foreseeable\n\n 4   consequence of the Port's failure to comply, if any.\n\n 5   The Port has never cited a single case for the\n\n 6   proposition that these damages are consequential\n\n 7   damages, and the sovereign immunity statute itself in\n\n 8   no way supports this proposition.\n\n 9                 The element of damages itself in\n\n10   Question No. 3, which is taken from the sovereign\n\n11   immunity statute, Section 271.153, provides that the\n\n12   increased cost to perform the work must be a direct\n\n13   result of Port-caused delays, which shows they must be\n\n14   direct rather than consequential.\n\n15                 Moreover, damages resulting from\n\n16   owner-caused delays are necessarily those which\n\n17   naturally and necessarily flow from a wrongful act and\n\n18   are presumed to have been foreseen or contemplated by\n\n19   the party as a consequence of his wrongful act, and\n\n20   thus are not consequential damages.\n\n21                 That's the Anderson Development Corp.\n\n22   case versus Coastal States Crude Gathering, 543 S.W.2d\n\n23   402, pinpoint 404 to 405.\n\n24                 Zachry objects to the instruction that\n\n25   you are instructed that you may only consider 5.41,\n\f                                                            60\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   5.42 and 5.52 to the extent it imposes requirements\n\n 2   consistent with Section 5.41 only in assessing a\n\n 3   party's state of mind.\n\n 4                   This instruction is an instruction that\n\n 5   was originally made as a limiting instruction to limit\n\n 6   the scope of the admissibility of evidence of these\n\n 7   clauses.    The purpose of the jury charge is to inform\n\n 8   the jury of the controlling law.\n\n 9                   As the pattern jury charge makes clear,\n\n10   the Court must instruct the jury as to its resolution\n\n11   of the meaning of any disputed contract provisions.\n\n12   This is Texas Pattern Jury Charge Section 101.7 in the\n\n13   comments.\n\n14                   Nothing authorizes the Court to point\n\n15   out the significance of a particular type of evidence\n\n16   in the jury charge.\n\n17                   By giving this instruction, the Court\n\n18   comments on the weight of the evidence and nudges the\n\n19   jury towards the Port's theory.\n\n20                   In other words, by giving this\n\n21   instruction, the Court embraces the Port's theory that\n\n22   these clauses can somehow be relevant to Zachry's, or\n\n23   for that matter, the Port's state of mind after the\n\n24   rejection of the frozen cutoff wall occurred on October\n\n25   11, 2009 (sic).\n\f                                                            61\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                   Even though the Court has held that\n\n 2   these provisions are inapplicable to bar Zachry's\n\n 3   damage claim.\n\n 4                   The Court suggests to the jury that\n\n 5   these provisions are relevant to the party's state of\n\n 6   mind and cause undue attention to the Port's theory of\n\n 7   the case.\n\n 8                   Furthermore, the instruction is\n\n 9   erroneous.   The Port's or Zachry's subjective state of\n\n10   mind is irrelevant where, as here, the Court has\n\n11   construed these clauses as a matter of law.\n\n12                   Parole evidence of the party's belief\n\n13   about the meaning of the clauses should not be admitted\n\n14   to vary the Court's construction of these clauses.      The\n\n15   instruction simply allows the Port to evade the Court's\n\n16   legal rulings about the inapplicability of these\n\n17   clauses.\n\n18                   Zachry objects to the inclusion in the\n\n19   definition of active interference of the sentence,\n\n20   Active interference requires more than a simple\n\n21   mistake, error in judgment, lack of total effort or\n\n22   lack of complete diligence.\n\n23                   This instruction is repetitive of the\n\n24   first sentence, which states that active interference\n\n25   means affirmative, willful action that unreasonably\n\f                                                           62\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   interferes with the other party's compliance with the\n\n 2   contract.\n\n 3                  The second sentence adds nothing as all\n\n 4   these matters are covered by the definition of active\n\n 5   interference in the first sentence.    The addition of\n\n 6   the second sentence simply emphasizes the Port's\n\n 7   claimed theory of the case to the jury, and is\n\n 8   therefore a comment on the weight of the evidence and a\n\n 9   nudging instruction designed to encourage the jury to\n\n10   adopt the Port's view of the facts.\n\n11                  Under Texas charge practice, the charge\n\n12   may not define a term like active interference in more\n\n13   general terms and then list specific examples of what\n\n14   the Port believes to be active interference.     This is\n\n15   akin to marshaling one's evidence in the jury charge.\n\n16                  Zachary objects to the inclusion of the\n\n17   Port's mitigation defense as well.    As the Texas\n\n18   Supreme Court has held, under mitigation principles,\n\n19   the long-standing law of this state requires a claimant\n\n20   to mitigate damages if it can do so with trifling\n\n21   expense or reasonable exertions.\n\n22                  That's the Gunn Infiniti versus O'Byrne\n\n23   case, 996 S.W.2d 854, Page 857 for the pinpoint.\n\n24                  As a result, the jury should be\n\n25   instructed that a party is only required to avoid\n\f                                                            63\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   damages if it can do so with trifling expense or\n\n 2   reasonable exertions.\n\n 3                   Zachry will separately request its\n\n 4   Proposed Instruction No. 10 on this issue.\n\n 5                   Zachry also objects to the definition of\n\n 6   bad faith.   It imposes too high of a burden.    Rather,\n\n 7   bad faith in the contract context is dishonesty of\n\n 8   believe or purpose.\n\n 9                   This is from the Restatement Second of\n\n10   Torts Section 205, comment d and also appears in\n\n11   Black's Law Dictionary 8th edition, Page 149.\n\n12                   Zachry will request its Proposed\n\n13   Instruction No. 11 on this issue.\n\n14                   Question Number 4, percentage delay and\n\n15   hindrance damages.     Zachry objects to Question No. 4,\n\n16   which asks about the percentage of Zachry's damages\n\n17   that were due to delay.\n\n18                   The Port has lost its argument that the\n\n19   no damages for delay clause is a complete bar to\n\n20   Zachry's damages.     It is not entitled to a question\n\n21   inquiring as to the amount of delay damages just in\n\n22   case they lose at trial but win on appeal.\n\n23                   There are myriad alternative issues that\n\n24   the parties may be curious about, that does not mean\n\n25   they are submitted.     Only issues that are raised by the\n\f                                                             64\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   written pleadings and the evidence, and that's quote,\n\n 2   are submitted.     That's Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n 3   278.\n\n 4                    Furthermore, only controlling issues\n\n 5   that are essential to a right or action or defense are\n\n 6   submitted.     That's Paul Mueller Company versus Alcon\n\n 7   Labs, 993 S.W.2d 851, Page 854.\n\n 8                    A controlling issue is one that requires\n\n 9   a factual determination to render a judgment in the\n\n10   case.    And that's also supported by Rule 277, which\n\n11   provides that the Court shall submit such instructions\n\n12   and definitions as shall be proper to enable the jury\n\n13   to render a verdict.     Question No. 4 is not such an\n\n14   issue.\n\n15                    Zachry also objects to Question No. 4\n\n16   because it refers to delay or -- delay and hindrance\n\n17   damages.     Section 508 of the general conditions bars\n\n18   delay or hindrance damages.\n\n19                    You know what, this is one that we might\n\n20   want to talk about.     I forgot about that.\n\n21                    So to the extent the instruction is\n\n22   given at all, it should track Section 5.08.      That is\n\n23   also how it is referred to in Question No. 3.\n\n24                    I'm not sure if that was intentional.\n\n25                    MS. YEATES:   Right.   Your Honor, we\n\f                                                           65\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   would agree to change that.       On Question No. 4 it\n\n 2   should say delay or hindrance damages.       Could we change\n\n 3   that?\n\n 4                    THE COURT:    One moment.\n\n 5                    All right.    I am changing that to delay\n\n 6   or hindrance.    Question 4.\n\n 7                    Okay.    How much more?\n\n 8                    MS. GREER:    I can talk faster.   About\n\n 9   three pages.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    All right.\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    She had 25.\n\n12                    Okay.    Question No. 5 on reimbursable\n\n13   costs.   Okay.   Zachry also objects to Question No. 5,\n\n14   which asks what amount of damages the jury found in\n\n15   Question No. 3 were for New Zachry's reimbursable\n\n16   costs.\n\n17                    Again, the Port's not entitled to a\n\n18   question on this issue just in case they lose at trial\n\n19   but win on appeal.\n\n20                    The Court has held that Zachry is\n\n21   entitled to recover New Zachry's reimbursable costs as\n\n22   a matter of law.     Accordingly, the amount of this cost\n\n23   is not a controlling issue that should be submitted.\n\n24                    Question No. 6, excuse for the Port's\n\n25   failure to comply.       The affidavits and partial releases\n\f                                                          66\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   of lien are unambiguously only lien releases, and so\n\n 2   Zachry objects that the issue should not be submitted\n\n 3   at all.\n\n 4                   Furthermore, to the extent that the\n\n 5   Court concludes that the partial lien releases are\n\n 6   ambiguous and that there are other reasonable\n\n 7   constructions of the partial lien releases besides\n\n 8   Zachry's construction, which Zachry vigorously\n\n 9   disputes, then the interpretation of the releases the\n\n10   Port previously advanced is at least one reasonable\n\n11   construction.\n\n12                   And we dispute it's reasonable, but if\n\n13   you think that there's more than our instruction, then\n\n14   it's at least one reasonable construction.\n\n15                   In the Port Authority's motion for\n\n16   partial summary judgment based on partial release\n\n17   executed by Zachry, the Port sought only partial\n\n18   summary judgment to the extent of the damages released.\n\n19                   And contended that the lien releases\n\n20   were only partial releases of liens.    If the\n\n21   interpretation of the partial lien releases is\n\n22   submitted to the jury at all, the jury should be given\n\n23   the opportunity to make this finding.\n\n24                   As Question No. 6 is drafted, the jury\n\n25   can only conclude that the release was a complete\n\f                                                           67\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   release of Zachry's claim or not a release at all.    The\n\n 2   jury's improperly precluded from finding that it is a\n\n 3   partial release and the amount of damages it releases.\n\n 4                  Question No. 7, Port's defense of\n\n 5   fraudulent inducement to Change Order 4.    The\n\n 6   instruction regarding fraud is erroneous because it\n\n 7   fails to require that the reliance be justifiable.\n\n 8   It's the Ernst & Young versus Pacific Mutual Life case,\n\n 9   551 S.W.3d 573, 577, Texas Supreme Court.\n\n10                  The instruction regarding fraud should\n\n11   not be submitted because there is no evidence that\n\n12   Change Order 4 was fraudulently induced because the\n\n13   Port knew the truth, that Zachry was behind on the\n\n14   schedule.\n\n15                  Furthermore, because the Port knew the\n\n16   truth, it could not have relied actually or\n\n17   justifiably.\n\n18                  Legal bars also preclude the assertion\n\n19   of the Port's defense of fraud, including that the Port\n\n20   ratified the fraud, the merger clause bars any reliance\n\n21   by the Port as a matter of law, and the election of\n\n22   remedies doctrine bars the Defense because the Port\n\n23   retains valuable benefits under the contract.\n\n24                  The submission of the fraud question is\n\n25   extreme -- and we've moved for directed verdict, so you\n\f                                                           68\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   have those arguments but -- the submission of the fraud\n\n 2   question is extremely prejudicial to Zachry because its\n\n 3   mere presence in the jury charge suggests to the jury\n\n 4   that the Court believes there's some evidence that\n\n 5   Zachry committed fraud or some potential basis on which\n\n 6   the Port could --\n\n 7                  THE REPORTER:    Some what?\n\n 8                  MS. GREER:   I'm sorry.     Potential basis.\n\n 9                  THE COURT:   Potential basis.\n\n10                  MS. GREER:   On which the Port could\n\n11   recover for fraud against Zachry.    Such a perception\n\n12   that Zachry could be a fraudfeasor is highly damaging\n\n13   and --\n\n14                  THE COURT:   Fraudfeasor?\n\n15                  MS. GREER:   Fraudfeasor.

In Ms. Greer's\n\n25   defense, she probably got about a half an hour of sleep\n\f                                                             69\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   last night.\n\n 2                    MS. GREER:   You nailed it.\n\n 3                    Okay.   Question No. 8, Zachry's defenses\n\n 4   to the Port's fraudulent inducement defense.     Zachry\n\n 5   contends that the Port's fraudulent inducement defense\n\n 6   is barred as a matter of law under the election of\n\n 7   remedies doctrine and therefore should not be\n\n 8   submitted.\n\n 9                    However, to the extent that the Court\n\n10   determines that it is not an issue, that it can be\n\n11   decided as a matter of law, then Zachry is entitled to\n\n12   the submission of its election of remedies defense.\n\n13   Zachry objects to its omission.\n\n14                    Zachry will separately request its\n\n15   Proposed Instruction No. 12 on this issue.\n\n16                    Question No. 9, withholding of the\n\n17   $600,000.     The instruction regarding the withholding of\n\n18   the $600,000 in payment from Zachry is erroneous\n\n19   because it is incomplete.\n\n20                    The instruction fails to give the jury\n\n21   any guidance as to the basis on which the Port was\n\n22   purportedly entitled to withhold the $600,000.     It does\n\n23   not direct the jury to the withholding clause that the\n\n24   question is apparently referring to, Section 6.05.\n\n25                    It does not direct the jury to the\n\f                                                           70\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   obligation under the contract that Zachry purportedly\n\n 2   breached.\n\n 3                  Zachry will separately request its\n\n 4   Proposed Instruction No. 13 on this issue.\n\n 5                  Question No. 9 also erroneously places\n\n 6   the burden of proof on Zachry.     The burden of proving\n\n 7   withholding, like offset, is on the party asserting it.\n\n 8                  That's the U.S. versus Use and Benefit\n\n 9   of D'Agostino Excavators, Inc., versus Heyward-Robinson\n\n10   Company case that we've previously given you.     430 F2d\n\n11   1077, 1085 to 86, out of the 2nd Circuit.\n\n12                  And by analogy, offset is an affirmative\n\n13   defense under the Brown versus American Transfer case,\n\n14   601 S.W.2d 931, pinpoint 936.\n\n15                  And also by analogy, proof of the right\n\n16   to withhold liquidated damages is an affirmative\n\n17   defense under the Borders versus KRLB case, 727 S.W.2d\n\n18   357, Page 360 pinpoint.\n\n19                  It is a matter of avoidance under Rule\n\n20   94.   Consistent with this law, Section 6.05\n\n21   and likewise, Section 6.7 by their plain terms impose\n\n22   the burden of proof on the Port.\n\n23                  Indeed, Texas law provides that, as I\n\n24   stated before under the Howell versus Kelly case and\n\n25   the Johnson versus McKinney American case, the burden\n\f                                                             71\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   of proof on the happening of a contingency that would\n\n 2   discharge parties from liability is on the party\n\n 3   seeking to avoid liability.\n\n 4                    Indeed, the Port -- I'm almost done --\n\n 5   indeed, the Port has previously and repeatedly taken\n\n 6   the position that it has the burden of proof on\n\n 7   withholding and offset.\n\n 8                    And we've cited you the places where\n\n 9   they've done that in Plaintiff Zachry Construction\n\n10   Corporation's motion to strike the Port's\n\n11   late-disclosed 10.5 million-dollar offset and\n\n12   withholding defenses and to exclude any evidence in\n\n13   support thereof at Pages 23 through 24 and Footnote 16.\n\n14                    Question No. 11, excuse for the Port's\n\n15   failure to pay $600,000.      The affidavits and partial\n\n16   releases of lien are unambiguously only lien\n\n17   releases --\n\n18                    THE COURT:   Slow down.   Slow down.\n\n19                    MS. GREER:   -- and so the issue should\n\n20   not be submitted at all.\n\n21                    Question No. 12, failure to comply by\n\n22   withholding the $2.36 million in liquidated damages.\n\n23                    Question No. 12.A, point, little Roman\n\n24   II should ask the jury what sum of money, if paid now\n\n25   in cash, would fairly and reasonably compensate the\n\f                                                          72\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Port for its damages, if any, that resulted from\n\n 2   Zachry's failure to comply that you find answer to\n\n 3   Question No. 12.A?\n\n 4                 The question should then define the\n\n 5   element of damages to be considered as the reasonable\n\n 6   and necessary cost of repairing the wharf fenders.\n\n 7   Otherwise, the jury is receiving no guidance as to what\n\n 8   it is they're supposed to determine or how they're\n\n 9   supposed to quantify damages.\n\n10                 Zachry will separately submit its\n\n11   Proposed Instruction No. 14 on this issue.\n\n12                 Question No. 13, attorneys' fees.\n\n13   Attorneys' fees should not be submitted at all because\n\n14   Zachry, as a matter of law, will prevail on its breach\n\n15   of contract claim because the releases are\n\n16   unambiguously lien releases.\n\n17                 Accordingly, the Port at most could\n\n18   deduct the sum for the wharf fenders, approximately, 1\n\n19   million from the $2.36 million in damages.   Although\n\n20   Zachry disputes that they should be deducted at all.\n\n21                 Accordingly, regardless, of what happens\n\n22   on the remaining breach of contract theories, Zachry\n\n23   will have a net recovery on its breach of contract\n\n24   claim, and as a matter of law, the Port cannot be the\n\n25   prevailing party.\n\f                                                             73\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    And for the foregoing reasons, Zachry\n\n 2   objects to the Court's charge and would like a ruling\n\n 3   on our objections.\n\n 4                            COURT'S RULING\n\n 5                    THE COURT:    Okay.

PHA hires Zachry to construct a wharf and understands Zachry plans\n         to use a freeze-wall means and methods. ..................................................... 1\n\nII.      The Contract makes Zachry solely responsible for choosing the means\n         and methods of construction and precludes PHA control. ........................... 4\n\nIII.     PHA belatedly adds an extension to the wharf design and recognizes\n         only Zachry can timely build it and only with the frozen-cutoff wall. ........ 5\n\nIV.      PHA conceals its unsubstantiated “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff\n         wall to induce Zachry into agreeing to build the extension. ........................ 8\n\nV.       PHA waits to reject the frozen-cutoff wall until after Zachry is bound\n         by CO4, which plainly incorporates the frozen-cutoff wall. ...................... 11\nVI.      PHA issues its R&R Order, which everyone understands rejected the\n         frozen-cutoff wall and which Zachry makes clear to PHA constitutes a\n         breach. ......................................................................................................... 15\n\nVII. PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall forces Zachry to complete\n     construction in the wet. ............................................................................... 16\n\nVIII. Working in the wet causes Zachry substantial damages for which it\n      sues.............................................................................................................. 21\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ............................................................................ 24\nARGUMENT ........................................................................................................ 26\n\n\n                                                              iv\n\fI.    Ample evidence supports the jury’s breach-of-contract findings. ............. 26\n\n      A.       Section 5.10 prohibited PHA’s R&R Order, and no other\n               Contract provision authorized it. ...................................................... 26\n\n               1.        Section 5.10 forbids PHA control of Zachry’s means and\n                         methods. ................................................................................. 26\n               2.        Section 4.07 forbids PHA control over Zachry’s health-\n                         and-safety plans...................................................................... 28\n\n               3.        None of PHA’s other cited provisions authorize the R&R\n                         Order. ..................................................................................... 29\n\n               4.        PHA is not remediless. ........................................................... 32\n\n               5.        The drilled-shaft submittal is consistent with Zachry’s\n                         reading. ................................................................................... 32\n\n      B.       PHA’s R&R Order breached CO4. .................................................. 33\n      C.       Question 1 was proper. ..................................................................... 35\n\nII.   The jury's verdict on causation and damages is supported by the\n      evidence. ..................................................................................................... 35\n\n      A.       Draper’s assumptions on damages were supported by the\n               evidence and did not vary materially from undisputed facts. .......... 36\n               1.        Draper’s treatment of freeze-pipe removal was supported\n                         by the evidence....................................................................... 37\n\n               2.        Draper’s treatment of sheet-pile installation was\n                         supported by the evidence...................................................... 39\n\n      B.       The evidence establishes causation. ................................................. 40\n\n               1.

Mike Engelhart, 151st Judicial District, Harris County.\n\nJury Verdict:        The jury found PHA breached both §5.10 of the Bayport\n                     Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n                     (“the Contract”) and Change Order 4 thereto. CR59:17390-\n                     91(A4).1 The jury further (1) awarded Zachry $18,602,697 in\n                     damages, CR59:17392-93(A4);2 (2) found that PHA’s breach\n                     was not excused by waiver, equitable estoppel, quasi-estoppel,\n                     release, or fraudulent inducement, CR59:17396-99(A4);\n                     (3) found that PHA did not fail to comply with the Contract by\n                     withholding $600,000 for dredging from PHA’s payment on\n                     amounts invoiced by Zachry, CR59:17402(A4); (4) with\n                     respect to the trial court’s determination that PHA failed to\n                     comply with the Contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36\n                     million that PHA withheld as liquidated damages, found\n                     (a) PHA’s breach was excused to the extent of $970,000 that\n                     PHA withheld from payments to Zachry for allegedly defective\n                     fenders, and (b) PHA’s breach was not excused based on\n                     release, CR59:17405-06(A4); and (5) found the reasonable fees\n                     for the necessary services of PHA’s attorneys totaled\n                     $10,697,750 for all stages of litigation and breach of contract\n                     theories, CR59:17407-08(A4).\n\nJudgment:            Judge Engelhart rendered judgment on the verdict, awarding\n\n1\n  Abbreviations in this brief are the same as in Zachry’s previously filed briefs in this case.\n“PHASupp.” refers to PHA’s Post-Remand Supplemental Brief of Appellant.\n2\n The jury found 58.13% of these damages to be delay damages, CR59:17394(A4), but the trial\ncourt entered an agreed order disregarding the jury’s answer, finding that 100% of those\ndamages were conclusively established to have been delay damages, CR60:17526.\n\n                                             xiv\n\f                 Zachry $19,992,697 in damages, which the court calculated by\n                 adding the $2.36 million in improperly withheld liquidated\n                 damages the court awarded Zachry on directed verdict plus the\n                 $18,602,697 jury award for a total of $20,962,697, and then\n                 deducting the $970,000 offset found by the jury.\n                 CR62:18166(A1). The court declined to award Zachry the\n                 $600,000 that Zachry claimed PHA wrongfully withheld from\n                 Zachry’s payments but that the jury had declined to award to\n                 Zachry. Id. The court also declined to award PHA attorneys’\n                 fees. CR62:18163-67(A1). The court awarded pre- and post-\n                 judgment interest and taxable costs. CR62:18166-67(A1).\n\nCourt of\nAppeals:         PHA appealed, and Zachry cross-appealed. CR64:18706-11;\n                 CR64:18925-27. A panel of the Fourteenth Court of Appeals\n                 consisting of Justices McCally, Christopher, and Boyce heard\n                 oral argument. In an opinion authored by Justice McCally, the\n                 Panel reversed and rendered judgment against Zachry, holding\n                 that (1) the no-damages-for-delay provision in §5.07 of the\n                 Contract precluded Zachry’s damages as a matter of\n                 law, (2) Zachry unambiguously released its claims for\n                 liquidated damages and for $600,000 withheld for dredging\n                 (Christopher, J., dissenting), (3) the trial court did not err in\n                 offsetting the judgment against PHA by $970,000 for allegedly\n                 defective wharf fenders, and (4) PHA should recover its\n                 attorneys’ fees from Zachry.

Zachry Construction Corporation v. Port of\n               Houston Authority of Harris County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119-20\n               (Tex. 2014)(A3). In an opinion authored by Justice Hecht, the\n               majority held that Zachry’s claim for delay damages was not\n               barred by governmental immunity or by the no-damages-for-\n               delay provision of the Contract. It also held that Zachry was\n               entitled to recover liquidated damages withheld by PHA, but\n               that there was some evidence to support the jury’s award of the\n               $970,000 offset for allegedly defective wharf fenders. Finally,\n                                      xv\n\fit concluded that PHA was not entitled to attorneys’ fees.\nBecause PHA had raised a number of other issues, the Supreme\nCourt remanded the case to the Fourteenth Court for further\nconsideration. Id. at 120(A3).\n\n\n\n\n                   xvi\n\f                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n1.    Breach of §5.10. The jury’s finding in Question 1 that PHA failed to\n\ncomply with §5.10 of the Contract is supported by factually and legally sufficient\n\nevidence, because, inter alia,\n\n      (a)    §5.10 provided PHA had no “right to control” Zachry's means and\n\n             methods,\n\n      (b)    no other provision of the Contract gave PHA such a right of control,\n\n             and\n\n      (c)    the evidence established that PHA exercised control over Zachry’s\n\n             means and methods by issuing a revise-and-resubmit order (“R&R\n\n             Order”) in response to Zachry's frozen-cutoff wall design.        See\n\n             Argument Part I.A.\n\n2.    Breach of CO4. The jury’s finding that PHA failed to comply with Change\n\nOrder 4 (“CO4”) is supported by factually and legally sufficient evidence, because,\n\ninter alia, PHA only challenges Zachry's interpretation of the change order—not\n\nwhether PHA failed to comply with it—and the evidence established that PHA\n\nagreed in CO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall embodied in the\n\nSeptember 9 design, thereby obviating any purported right PHA had to issue the\n\nR&R Order. See Argument Part I.B.\n\n\n\n\n                                       xvii\n\f3.    Instruction in Question 1. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ninstructing the jury in Question 1 that it was “not being asked to decide whether\n\nPHA failed to comply with §5.10.” See Argument Part I.C.\n\n      (a)   The instruction properly clarified that the jury was being asked to\n\n            decide in Question 1 whether CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the\n\n            frozen-cutoff wall embodied in the Sept. 9 design, and if so, whether\n\n            PHA failed to comply with such a right, as distinguished from the\n\n            question whether PHA complied with §5.10, which the jury\n\n            considered in Question No. 2. See Argument Part I.C.\n\n      (b)   PHA has not shown and cannot show reversible error, because the\n\n            jury found in Question 2 that PHA failed to comply with §5.10;\n\n            Zachry was entitled to a directed verdict on its claim for breach of\n\n            CO4, and Question 1 should not have been submitted; and PHA has\n\n            not otherwise shown harm. See Argument Part I.C.\n\n4.    Damages. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\n\njury's finding of damages in Question 3. See Argument Part II.A. And the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in refusing to exclude Draper’s testimony. See\n\nArgument Part II.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                      xviii\n\f5.     Causation. The evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\n\njury’s finding that PHA’s failure to comply with §5.10 and/or CO4 caused\n\nZachry’s damages. See Argument Part II.B.\n\n       (a)   Zachry offered sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of\n\n             causation, and expert testimony was not required. See Argument Part\n\n             II.B.\n\n       (b)   PHA waived its argument that Zachry was required to prove that,\n\n             absent PHA’s breach, it would have completed all of Milestone-A in\n\n             the dry before either February 15 or May 15, 2006. See Argument\n\n             Part II.B.\n\n       (c)   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in charging the jury as to\n\n             apparent authority, and PHA shows no harm. See Argument Part II.C.\n\n6.     Sections 5.41/5.42. The trial court did not err in holding that §§5.41/5.42\n\n(and §5.52 to the extent it imposes the same requirements as §5.41) do not bar\n\nZachry’s breach-of-contract claim based on the R&R Order. See Argument Part\n\nIII.\n\n       (a)   The plain language of §§5.41/5.42 applies to changes during the\n\n             performance of the Contract, not to PHA’s breach of contract. See\n\n             Argument Part III.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xix\n\f(b)   The Shintech rule precludes application of §§5.41/5.42 to bar\n\n      Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim. See Argument Part III.B.1.\n\n(c)   The radical-change doctrine precludes application of §§5.41/5.42 to\n\n      bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim. See Argument Part III.B.2\n\n(d)   Section 16.071 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n\n      precludes application of §5.42 to bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract\n\n      claim. See Argument Part III.B.3.\n\n(e)   Zachry’s compliance with §§5.41/5.42 was not tried to the jury\n\n      because the trial court ruled before trial that §§5.41/5.42 were invalid\n\n      and/or inapplicable, the jury was instructed that it could only consider\n\n      §§5.41/5.42 for state of mind, and no jury question was submitted\n\n      regarding §§5.41/5.42. Even if §5.42 could be considered to have\n\n      been tried in such circumstances, there was factually and legally\n\n      sufficient evidence that Zachry substantially complied with §5.42.\n\n      See Argument Part III.C.\n\n(f)   Because §§5.41/5.42 were inapplicable, the trial court did not abuse\n\n      its discretion in instructing the jury that, to recover its damages from\n\n      the R&R Order, Zachry was not required to obtain a §5.41 change\n\n      order or give §5.42 notice, but could consider these provisions only in\n\n\n\n\n                                  xx\n\f            assessing state of mind, and PHA shows no harm. See Argument Part\n\n            III.\n\n      (g)   Even if PHA could establish error with respect to §§5.41/5.42, the\n\n            proper remedy is remand, not rendition. See Argument Part IV.D.\n\n7.    Section 5.08.   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding\n\nevidence that Zachry did not seek an extension of time under §5.08 for PHA’s\n\nbreach of contract, given that §5.08 does not apply to breaches of contract and is\n\nthus irrelevant; any probative value of such evidence is outweighed by the danger\n\nof unfair prejudice to Zachry; and PHA has shown no harm, because the evidence\n\nis not controlling on a dispositive, material issue, nor did it probably cause the\n\nrendition of an improper judgment. See Argument Part IV.E.\n\n8.    Exclusion of $8.6 Million in Alleged Harms. The trial court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in excluding PHA's claimed $8.6 million in alleged “actual harms”\n\nclaimed as offsets based on PHA’s failure to timely disclose any intent to seek\n\nthese harms as an offset defense to be deducted from Zachry’s damages award.\n\nPHA is not entitled to a new trial to try an additional offset defense based on the\n\ntrial court’s exclusion of PHA’s claimed harms. See Argument Part IV.\n\n9.    PHA’s Open-the-Door Theory. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nexcluding a subset of PHA’s claimed actual-harms evidence with respect to the\n\n\n\n\n                                        xxi\n\farbitrary-and-capricious and bad-faith no-damages-for-delay exceptions despite\n\nfinding that the “door” had been “opened.” See Argument Part V.\n\n      (a)   There was no misimpression to correct, because Zachry only argued\n\n            that PHA promised that it would not charge liquidated damages if the\n\n            crane-ship could dock when it arrived—not that PHA would not\n\n            charge LDs if it suffered no harm at all. See Argument Part V.A.\n\n      (b)   In any event, the probative value of PHA’s actual-harms evidence in\n\n            refuting any minor misimpression would be substantially outweighed\n\n            by undue delay and the danger of unfair prejudice to Zachry.

See Argument Part\n\n            VI.B.\n\n      (d)   Even if error, remand for a new trial is not necessary, because the\n\n            Court can be reasonably certain that the jury was not significantly\n\n            influenced by the fraud issue. See Argument Part VI.B.\n\n      (e)   PHA’s evidentiary challenge to the fraud finding is limited to the\n\n            sufficiency of the evidence to show that PHA knew that CO4 included\n\n            an agreement that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall, because\n\n            that was the only basis for its evidentiary challenge in its original\n\n            Brief of Appellant.

The Court observed\n\nthe evidence “was hotly disputed” and the standard of review required it to view\n\ndisputed evidence in Zachry’s favor:\n\n      In reviewing any case tried to a jury, we must view the evidence “in\n      the light most favorable to the verdict”—in this case a verdict for\n      [Zachry]—“crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could,\n      and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could\n      not”....\n\nZachry, 449 S.W.3d at 101 n.3(A3). The Court recited the evidence “in that light.”\n\nId.\n\n      The same standard applies to this Court’s review on remand. Yet PHA\n\nnever mentions the governing standard and ignores the Supreme Court’s factual\n\nrecitations pursuant to it. As a result, PHA erroneously portrays the evidence in\n\nthe light most favorable to PHA, not Zachry.\n\n      This fact statement comports with the standard governing this Court’s\n\nreview on remand.\n\nI.    PHA hires Zachry to construct a wharf and understands Zachry plans\n      to use a freeze-wall means and methods.\n      In 1999, PHA hired DMJM to design a 1660-foot wharf. 6:8-9, 90. The\n\nproject was subsequently delayed five years. 67:40-41; PX466.0004. In 2004,\n\nPHA hired CH2M-Hill as construction manager—PHA’s on-site representative\n\n                                        1\n\fand primary point-of-contact with the project’s general contractor (ultimately,\n\nZachry). 6:84-86; 20:38; 44:43-44.\n\n      That same year, PHA chose Zachry to build the wharf because, among other\n\nreasons, Zachry’s unique means and methods of construction—a frozen wall—\n\nused fewer emissions credits, as the freeze-wall would enable Zachry to build the\n\nwharf primarily on dry land (“in the dry”), rather than in the water (“in the wet”).\n\n7:15-16; 39:46.\n\n      Zachry’s choice of means and methods was critical to sequencing\n\nconstruction tasks.    The project originally entailed installing the following\n\nalongside the bay:\n\n      *     a five-section, concrete wharf deck;\n\n      *     thousands of under-deck concrete drilled shafts, or piers; and\n\n      *     concrete revetment blocks protecting the under-deck soil slope. 9:25,\n            27-28, 59-61.\n\n      To accomplish these tasks in the dry, Zachry’s unique means and methods\n\nentailed building a frozen, u-shaped soil berm around the construction site to hold\n\nback the bay. 9:58-61. Zachry would sink pipes into the berm and then freeze it\n\nby circulating sub-freezing brine through the pipes. While building the wall,\n\nZachry would simultaneously build the wharf in the dry behind it, drilling concrete\n\npiers into the ground and then building the deck on top, using the ground as a\n\nconcrete form. Zachry would then excavate dirt under the wharf and among the\n                                         2\n\fpiers using dry-land equipment (e.g., bulldozers). Once the u-shaped berm was\n\nfrozen, Zachry could excavate even deeper. As it completed excavation, Zachry\n\nwould place revetment on the under-deck slope. Zachry would then breach the\n\nfreeze-wall, allowing water to reach the wharf, and then remove the remainder of\n\nthe freeze-wall in the wet. See 9:27-28, 59-73.\n\n      This plan depended on using the freeze-wall and—importantly—working in\n\nthe dry until the freeze-wall was breached: a contractor working in the wet would\n\nnever build the piers and deck before excavating, given the difficulty and cost of\n\nexcavating and placing revetment underwater, beneath the deck, and among the\n\npiers. 9:76-77; 47:34.\n\n      By October 2003, PHA began asking Zachry about the effect of freezing soil\n\nnear piers. 7:24-27; 37:31-32; PX49.0002-3; PX67; PX116.           Among other\n\nprecautions, Zachry and freeze-wall-designer Dan Mageau stated they would keep\n\nfrozen soils nine feet away from the drilled shafts “wherever possible.” PX6.006.\n\nThus, if it were not possible, they would not. 9:149. PHA—which had no soil-\n\nfreeze expertise—requested the nine-foot distance, which had no scientific basis.\n\n29:62-63. Mageau, the project’s only soil-freeze expert, established through tests\n\nprovided to PHA that “one freeze-thaw cycle does not appear to reduce the shear\n\nstrength in the soil.” PX138.0014; PX7.0010; 29:106-08; see 21:112.\n\n      PHA and Zachry executed the Contract June 1, 2004. DX1. It was PHA’s\n\n\n                                         3\n\fform contract. 6:21-24. Given its 5-year delay, PHA imposed a tight, two-year\n\ncompletion deadline. 6:88; 64:22; DX1-1.0002. There was an interim deadline\n\n(“Milestone-A”) of February 1, 2006 to finish 660 feet of wharf to allow a ship to\n\ndeliver cranes from China. 9:79.\n\nII.      The Contract makes Zachry solely responsible for choosing the means\n         and methods of construction and precludes PHA control.\n         The freeze-wall (and later, frozen-cutoff wall) was undisputedly Zachry’s\n\nconstruction means and methods. 6:76; 8:90, 94; 26:123; 37:52-53. Contract\n\n§5.10 made Zachry solely responsible for its means and methods and barred PHA\n\ninterference:\n\n         The Port Authority shall not have the right to control the manner in which\n         or prescribe the method by which the Contractor performs the Work. As an\n         independent Contractor, the Contractor shall be solely responsible for\n         supervision of and performance of the Work and shall prosecute the Work\n         at such time and seasons, in such order or precedence, and in such manner,\n         using such methods as Contractor shall choose....\n\nDX1-1.0214(A13). 3 Nothing in §5.10 permitted PHA to reject Zachry’s methods.\n\n27:26-27; pp.26-27.\n\n         PHA conceded §5.10’s purpose was to “isolat[e] the Port Authority from\n\nhaving any responsibilities for the contract[or]’s means and methods,” and “keep\n\nthe responsibility and liability on [the contractor’s] side of the table.” 8:91, 93; see\n\n6:39-42; 27:6-7. The Supreme Court recognized this “provision benefitted the\n\n3\n    Emphasis added unless noted otherwise.\n\n                                             4\n\fPort, insulating it from liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising\n\ncontrol over Zachry’s work.” 449 S.W.3d at 102 & n.4(A3)(citing Gen. Elec. v.\n\nMoritz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895009\"><a href=\"/opinion/895009/general-elec-co-v-moritz/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (Tex. 2008)).\n\n       Consistent with this purpose, nothing in the Contract gave PHA the right to\n\nissue the October 11, 2005 revise-and-resubmit order (“R&R Order”). See pp.26-\n\n34. To avoid any claim of control and attendant liability, PHA did not approve or\n\nreject the main freeze-wall, but simply ensured it had been approved by a Texas\n\nProfessional Engineer (“PE”) and “accepted [it] for records.” 37:115-16; 44:90;\n\npp.28-29.\n\nIII.   PHA belatedly adds an extension to the wharf design and recognizes\n       only Zachry can timely build it and only with the frozen-cutoff wall.\n       Nine months into the Contract—less than a year before Milestone-A—PHA\n\nbelatedly realized its 5-year-old wharf design was too short, and added a 332-foot\n\nsixth section. PX130.0004; PX141.0016; 7:34-37. PHA concluded only Zachry\n\ncould timely build the extension within emissions limits. PX3(A28); PX224(A24);\n\n8:22-27; 22:103-07; 45:138-40; see 7:37-40, 78; 38:34-35; PX192.002. PHA knew\n\nZachry was pressed to timely finish, and that PHA had to move quickly to avoid\n\ndelay. PX164, ¶9; PX172 at 3; 7:35-37, 44, 84-85; 25:50-53; 45:79.\n\n       To accommodate PHA’s belated addition, Zachry would have to modify its\n\nmethods to add a “frozen-cutoff wall” to ensure it could timely complete\n\nMilestone-A to allow the crane-ship to dock and finish the remainder of the wharf\n\n                                        5\n\fin the dry. 7:99-101; 9:138-39; 27:96; 38:51-53; PX8.0011(A20). On April 5,\n\n2005, Zachry’s Project Manager Andy Anderson told CH2M-Hill’s Construction\n\nManager Andy Thiess and Design Manager Jeff Ely that Zachry’s extension\n\nproposal was based on using a frozen-cutoff wall, which he sketched and explained\n\nwould encompass one B-row pier. PX8.0004-5, .0013(A20); 10:18-29; 21:128-30;\n\n38:39, 46, 48-49, 61-62, 130-31. Thiess and Ely understood the frozen-cutoff wall\n\nwould also be 4.5 feet from two rows of piers, and promptly sketched and\n\ndescribed the wall to PHA officials, including Project Manager Jim McQueen and\n\nBayport Engineer Mark Vincent (who reported to Chief Engineer Steve DeWolf,\n\nmanaged the project for him, and was charged with helping administer the Contract\n\ncorrectly on PHA’s behalf). 7:32, 104-11; 21:104-08, 128-29; 24:120, 135-39;\n\n38:62-63; 44:83; 45:41-46; 64:34-35; PX61.\n\n       PHA contends Thiess and Ely were not concerned about the design at the\n\nApril 5 meeting because they believed the frozen soil would impact only the single\n\nB-row pier entirely encompassed by the frozen-cutoff wall. PHASupp:5. But Ely\n\nand Vincent testified they were concerned because the 4.5-foot distance between\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall and piers was half the nine-foot buffer Zachry said it would\n\nmaintain “whenever possible.”4         21:110-11, 138-39; 45:63; p.3.         Furthermore,\n\n4\n PHA’s assertion that Thiess was unconcerned because he thought 4.5 feet (1½ pier diameters)\nwas acceptable based on a “rule of thumb” was discredited: nothing documented the “rule,” and\nPHA’s geotechnical experts were unaware of it. 27:121-23; 38:68-69, 73-74.\n\n                                             6\n\fThiess, Ely, Vincent, and DeWolf knew the “freeze front” would migrate away\n\nfrom the freeze-pipes and “go around” the piers 4.5 feet away (if not stopped).\n\n7:52-53, 106-14; 10:26-27; 21:139; 25:38-39; 29:68; 37:117-18; 45:63;\n\nPX138.0018. Ely told Vincent, Thiess, and McQueen that freezing would occur\n\nvery close to some piers, in his view potentially reducing their capacity. 22:96-97,\n\n128-29; 23:5-8, 24.\n\n      PHA also asserts Anderson had considered a frozen-cutoff wall as an option\n\nto help Zachry timely complete Milestone-A. PHASupp:4.              However, PHA\n\nunderstood the frozen-cutoff wall became “required if Zachry were going to do the\n\nextension” and still meet the Milestone-A deadline. 7:99-101; see 9:138-39; 10:31,\n\n112; 27:96; 28:31-32; 38:51-53; PX8.0011(A20). The reason was simple. With\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry could timely accommodate the crane-ship’s arrival\n\non one side of the cutoff-wall and still finish the remainder of the wharf, including\n\nthe extension, in the dry on the other. 10:35; 38:38; 7:100-01; 28:31-33; PX172 at\n\n4-5. Without the frozen-cutoff wall, the addition of the sixth wharf section meant\n\nZachry would have to try to complete, excavate, and place revetment under the\n\nentirety of the now-20% longer wharf by the Milestone-A deadline; at that time,\n\nthe main freeze-wall would be breached to dock the crane-ship, and Zachry would\n\nhave to finish the entire project in the wet.          9:135-36; 21:94; 28:33-34;\n\nPX8.0011(A20).\n\n\n                                         7\n\fIV.   PHA conceals its unsubstantiated “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff\n      wall to induce Zachry into agreeing to build the extension.\n      On April 13, 2005, Zachry sent PHA a proposal to build the wharf extension\n\nbased on an “[u]ninterrupted work process” and the “[u]se of a freeze wall—cut off\n\nwall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling.” PX9(A21); 10:111. These conditions\n\nwere unchanged by a May 18 proposal and July 11 supplemental proposal.\n\nPX179(A22); PX219(A23).\n\n      PHA understood Zachry’s price was based on these conditions, and that the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall in the proposals was the same one described to Thiess and Ely\n\non April 5. 22:22-25; 25:44-47; 38:96-97; 45:75-76. PHA also knew the frozen-\n\ncutoff wall was Zachry’s only means and methods to timely complete the wharf.\n\n22:125-26; 26:119-20; 38:112; 45:103-04; 46:40.\n\n      Even though PHA knew the frozen-cutoff wall was “required,” it never told\n\nZachry its concerns, 11:13; 22:96, 146, despite knowing quick resolution of such\n\nconcerns was critical to avoid delaying Zachry under the tight schedule.\n\nPX46.0001; 7:43-44, 67-68; 20:53-56.\n\n      The Supreme Court recognized that PHA—afraid Zachry might decline to\n\nbuild the extension—induced Zachry into entering Change Order 4 (“CO4”) to\n\nbuild it by intentionally concealing PHA’s concerns about the frozen-cutoff wall:\n\n      As a practical matter, only Zachry could perform the additional work.\n      . . . The Port had reservations about this [frozen-cutoff wall] plan. But\n      the Port was also concerned that if it rejected Zachry’s plan, Zachry\n\n                                         8\n\f      might simply refuse to undertake the addition of a sixth section. So\n      the Port did not raise its concern with Zachry.\n\n449 S.W.3d at 102-03(A3).\n\n      The Supreme Court’s conclusion was amply supported. PHA knew only\n\nZachry could build the extension without undue additional cost and delay. See p.5.\n\nBut Zachry was already on a tight schedule. See pp.4, 5. Adding the sixth section\n\nmeant Zachry would have to do 20% more work, p.7, though CO4 would only\n\nextend Milestone-A by 15 days, see p.4; PX12.0004 (A30).\n\n      However, PHA had not signed CO4. 8:36; 27:40. As a result, Zachry could\n\nnot begin working on the extension, exacerbating the already-tight schedule.\n\nPX225 at 4-5; PX226 at 3-6; PX228; PX229; PX232 at 13; 10:52-54, 68, 73;\n\n26:68; 18:84-87; 26:93-94, 102-09. And Zachry was not contractually bound to\n\nbuild it. 27:40. PHA Project Manager McQueen blamed PHA “bureaucrats” for\n\nthe delay. PX215 at 7.\n\n      Aware of Zachry’s time-crunch and that Zachry was not yet bound, PHA\n\n“management [wa]s afraid ZCC w[ould] back out of the extension agreement.”\n\nPX280(A29); 27:40; 45:113. PHA therefore acted to keep Zachry on the hook by\n\ninducing it into CO4.\n\n      First, although PHA knew throughout the summer of 2005 that Zachry\n\nprojected it would not timely complete Milestone-A (because Zachry was\n\nincluding an extension of time it claimed under Contract §5.08 due to a global-\n                                        9\n\fcement shortage), PHA decided to pay Zachry anyway and delay taking any formal\n\naction against it—such as demanding a recovery schedule—until after CO4’s\n\nexecution. PX159; PX176; PX210; PX280(A29); PX319; 18:143-49; 22:109-11;\n\n27:36-40; 39:17-18; see p.17.\n\n      Second, PHA allayed Zachry’s concerns about the $20,000/day Milestone-A\n\nliquidated damages (“LDs”).      PHA had denied Zachry’s request to extend\n\nMilestone-A based on the global-cement shortage. PX159; PX175; PX176; 25:60-\n\n61. Zachry thus sought assurances that PHA would not charge LDs if the crane-\n\nship could dock upon arrival. 25:66-67; PX177. In that case, PHA would not be\n\ncharged demurrage—the basis for Milestone-A’s $20,000/day LDs. 45:65-66; see\n\nalso PX935 at 1, PX936 at 4; DX1-1.0021(A17).         Recognizing the ship was\n\ndelayed, PHA’s Vincent told McQueen that “[a]lthough we will not put it in\n\nwriting,” McQueen should tell Zachry PHA “will not charge penalties if no\n\nexpense or loss to PHA occurs….” PX176; 28:71. McQueen complied, telling\n\nAnderson PHA would not charge LDs if the ship could dock upon arrival (because\n\nPHA would not be charged demurrage). 10:41; see 28:74.\n\n      Although PHA contends it promised not to charge LDs only if PHA\n\nsustained no harm whatsoever, McQueen confirmed Zachry’s understanding: he\n\ntestified PHA acted contrary to its promise in charging LDs even though the crane-\n\nship docked upon arrival. 28:74; see also PX205.0002. The Supreme Court\n\n\n                                       10\n\fcorrectly concluded that “[i]n negotiating [CO4], PHA had promised not to impose\n\n[LDs]...as long as the [crane-]ship…could dock when it arrived,” but\n\n“[n]evertheless, after the ship successfully docked,…began withholding [LDs].”\n\n449 S.W.3d at 103(A3).\n\n      Third, despite its “concerns” about the frozen-cutoff wall it knew was\n\n“required” to allow Zachry to meet Milestone-A, PHA did not object to it before\n\nCO4 was signed. 11:13, 106; 19:80-81; 22:76, 96, 119. PHA instead agreed in\n\nCO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall. See pp.12-13, 33-34.\n\nV.    PHA waits to reject the frozen-cutoff wall until after Zachry is bound by\n      CO4, which plainly incorporates the frozen-cutoff wall.\n      On September 9, 2005, soil-freeze expert Mageau sent Zachry the frozen-\n\ncutoff-wall design. PX10(A25). It was identical in all material respects to the wall\n\ndiscussed at the April 5 meeting and incorporated into the proposals. PX10.0001-\n\n.0002, .0005(A25); 8:42-43, 53; 10:94-98, 111; 22:73-77; 29:123-24.\n\n      Anderson directed the design be sent to PHA “for review. Not approval—\n\nbut review.” PX267; 10:92-93. On September 12, Zachry labeled the design\n\n“Correspondence” (not “Submittal”) and uploaded it to PHA, noting PHA could\n\n“see what will be happening and gather questions.”        PX897; 8:39; 11:33-34;\n\n38:152, 157; 45:143. PHA knew it was not provided as a Submittal, and that\n\nZachry was not asking for approval, just comments. 38:152-53, 157; 45:143-44.\n\nLike the main freeze-wall, PHA could review it for a Texas PE’s approval, but\n\n                                        11\n\fcould not approve, reject, or order Zachry to revise and resubmit it. 9:49-50;\n\n11:28; 22:70-72, 93-94; 23:91-92; DX5.002; pp.5, 28-29. CH2M-Hill’s Thiess\n\ntold PHA’s McQueen internally, “[t]his isn’t going to be an approval-type thing,”\n\nPX274 at 3(A26); 39:37-38, but recognized PHA “need[ed] due diligence to\n\nidentify and communicate any technical issues,” PX11(A27); 22:93-94.\n\n      Based on the September 9 design, PHA’s Vincent and McQueen understood\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall “was freezing up and near the shafts.” 46:5; see 26:150-52.\n\nCH2M-Hill’s Ely noted they needed to “verify the freeze wall won’t reduce the\n\ncapacity of the…piers.”       PX11(A27).    Nevertheless, PHA management on\n\nSeptember 14 formally recommended PHA execute CO4. PX3(A28); 26:161-63;\n\n39:44-49; 45:147-48.\n\n      PHA finally executed CO4 on September 27. PX12.0002(A30). As the\n\nSupreme Court recognized, CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall embodied in the September 9 design:\n\n      To complete the two sections of the wharf needed by February 2006\n      and to continue to work ‘in the dry,’ Zachry proposed to build another\n      freeze-wall—a cutoff wall—through the middle of the\n      project....Change Order 4, using Zachry’s approach to add a sixth\n      section of the wharf...was finalized September 27, 2005.\n\n449 S.W.3d at 101, n.3(A3).\n\n      CO4 provided Zachry would construct the extension “in accordance with the\n\nattached Scope, Time and Price Modifications,” which incorporated Zachry’s\n\n\n                                       12\n\fproposals conditioned on an “[u]ninterrupted work process” and the “[u]se of a\n\nfreeze wall—cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling.” See pp.8, 33-34;\n\nPX12.0001, .0004(A30); 26:112-14. PHA had reviewed the September 9 design,\n\nwhich embodied the April 5 design described in the proposals, for two weeks\n\nbefore executing CO4. 10:111-16, 118, 8:50-51; 22:92, 119-20; 27:37; 45:147-48;\n\np.34.\n\n        Although PHA’s Vincent and McQueen had known for two weeks (and\n\nreally since April 5, p.6-7) that the frozen-cutoff wall design involved freezing\n\nnear piers, Ely—on the same day PHA signed CO4—reiterated to McQueen that\n\nfrozen soils would be kept only one foot from piers, allegedly putting 23 piers “at\n\nrisk for capacity reduction.” PX286. He did so despite freeze-soil expert Mageau’s\n\ntests proving “one freeze-thaw cycle does not appear to reduce the shear strength in\n\nthe soil.” See p.3.\n\n        On September 28, Mageau provided PHA more analyses proving that even if\n\nsoil were frozen all the way around the piers, there would be virtually no increase\n\nin settlement. PX14.0001(A31); 22:150-51; 27:66; 29:76-77; 39:66-69. PHA\n\nknew there was no reason for concern. 39:66-69; PX504(A36). But no one\n\nassociated with PHA would take responsibility for allowing Zachry to move\n\nforward:\n\n*       McQueen told CH2M-Hill “I have a problem and we need an answer\n        ASAP,” and that Ely and Thiess had “to take the lead in resolving this\n                                        13\n\f      problem w/a solution.” PX301.\n\n*     CH2M-Hill would not opine on the design, because it did not want to incur\n      liability for Zachry’s methods. 23:89; 30:84-85; 46:43.\n\n*     Wharf-designer DMJM refused to review the design because it was Zachry’s\n      means and methods. 30:63-64; 46:41-42.\n\n*     PHA had not yet hired its geotechnical engineer, GeoTest, to review the\n      design, and knew GeoTest would never give a definitive answer anyway.\n      PX1(A32); 23:23, 75-76.\n\nInstead, Ely surveyed CH2M-Hill’s geotechnical experts about his “concern,”\n\nexplaining he wanted to “give our client some guidance without incurring\n\nadditional liability if possible.” PX15; 22:157-61; 23:25-28. Most responders—\n\nincluding some with soil-freeze experience—concluded the design presented no\n\nconcern.   PX290; PX292; PX293; 23:31-47; 46:19-24.           Nevertheless, Ely\n\ndisregarded these geotechnical experts, and sent PHA a memo expressing\n\nunsubstantiated “concerns” about this geotechnical issue “from a structural\n\nengineering, not geotechnical perspective.” PX301; 23:56-62; see PX11(A27).\n\n      PHA conceded at trial it had not determined—or even tried to determine—\n\nthat the frozen-cutoff wall was likely to adversely affect piers, 8:79-80, 89-90;\n\n22:84; 23:97, 101-02; 24:112-14; 27:32, 80-84; 46:30-36, 58-59, although Chief\n\nEngineer DeWolf expected his engineers to get GeoTest involved, 6:7, 10; 7:110-\n\n14. PHA’s only information consisted of soil-freeze expert Mageau’s reports\n\nproving freezing would have no adverse effect. 24:112-13; 27:66; 39:96; 46:27,\n\n\n                                       14\n\f30-31, 57-59; PX14(A31); PX138.0014.\n\nVI.   PHA issues its R&R Order, which everyone understands rejected the\n      frozen-cutoff wall and which Zachry makes clear to PHA constitutes a\n      breach.\n      Despite knowing the tight schedule and imminent Milestone-A deadline,\n\npp.4, 5, 9, on October 11, 2005, PHA switched the September 9 design’s label\n\nfrom “Correspondence” to “Submittal” and issued the R&R Order. PX266(A33);\n\n11:31, 33-34; 27:82, 88-89. The order expressed concern about freezing’s effect\n\n“on the friction resistance of the piles,” and stated “preliminary indications are\n\nthat the design may have an indeterminate affect [sic] on a significant number of\n\nnearby shafts which may present unacceptable risk to the Port”—a concern\n\nVincent and McQueen admitted was “speculation.” PX266(A33); 27:84; 46:49-50.\n\n      Everyone knew the R&R Order rejected the frozen-cutoff wall. See, e.g.,\n\n39:133-36; PX1(A32); PX2(A35); PX358.0001. PHA conceded this at trial. 4:94;\n\n27:74; 39:135. The frozen-cutoff wall was undisputedly Zachry’s means and\n\nmethods, and Zachry had the right to use it under Contract §5.10 and CO4. See\n\npp.4-5, 12-13, 26-34. Yet, as the Supreme Court recognized, “[t]he practical effect\n\nof the Port’s [R&R] order was to refuse to allow the construction of the cutoff\n\nwall.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3); see 8:69-70; 21:58-59; 45:34-35; DX1-1.0219-20,\n\n§5.22(A13) (subject of revise-and-resubmit order “may not be used for\n\nperformance of the Work”). Although PHA now claims Zachry could have offered\n\n\n                                        15\n\fa means of mitigating the frozen-cutoff wall’s “risk,” PHA demanded a nonfrozen\n\nalternative. PX4.0003 (“The cut-off wall…cannot be constructed using freeze-wall\n\ntechnology.”); PX314 at 3-4(A34); 11:56; 23:101; 27:87-88; 68:114.\n\n      Although PHA mischaracterizes this as a “secret breach,” the Supreme Court\n\ncorrectly concluded Zachry told PHA it was a breach: “Zachry protested that,\n\nunder [§]5.10…, the Port had no right to determine the method and manner of the\n\nwork, but the Port would not budge.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3). At the October 11\n\nmeeting where the R&R Order was delivered, Anderson immediately objected that\n\nit was contrary to the Contract: he told PHA the design was “not a submittal that\n\nrequires approval,” but “is for information purposes only,” and Zachry’s risk to\n\naccept. PX314 at 4, 6-7(A34); 11:33-34, 39; 18:127-28; 23:102-04; 27:88-89.\n\nMcQueen responded, “I understand.” PX314 at 7(A34).          McQueen expressed\n\nconcern PHA could be liable and admitted he knew Anderson was saying PHA\n\nviolated the Contract. PX1(A32); PX287; 23:82-85; 27:48-49, 89-90, 93-94; see\n\nalso 44:82-83 (Vincent). Later on October 11, Anderson told Thiess the R&R\n\nOrder was a breach. 11:40-41. A month later, Thiess acknowledged Zachry had\n\nclaimed PHA’s “rejection of the cutoff-wall design is a breach of the change order\n\ncontract.” PX2(A35); 39:130; 68:122.\n\nVII. PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall forces Zachry to complete\n     construction in the wet.\n      Contrary to PHA’s claim that Zachry voluntarily switched to working in the\n\n                                       16\n\fwet, the evidence establishes PHA forced Zachry to do so. First, PHA barred\n\nZachry from using its frozen-cutoff wall—the means and methods PHA knew was\n\n“required” to timely complete the wharf in the dry, given the additional extension\n\nwork. See pp.7, 8, 15. Then, three days later, despite having known for months\n\nthat Zachry projected a delayed Milestone-A completion, pp.9-10, 18.        Chief\n\nEngineer DeWolf for the first time sent Zachry a letter demanding a recovery\n\nschedule (showing Zachry would finish by the Contract deadlines, which were\n\nconditioned on the frozen-cutoff wall) and threatening LDs. PX319; 19:29-31.\n\nHigher-ranking PHA officials repeated this demand in October and November.\n\nSee, e.g., 40:32-33, 38-40; 46:82-83; 66:86-87; DX85; DX205.003; PX373.0003;\n\nPX925. See also 35:6; 36:5-7.\n\n      By demanding a recovery schedule after barring Zachry’s frozen-cutoff wall,\n\nPHA necessarily forced Zachry to begin working in the wet far earlier than it\n\notherwise would have. 18:115-17, 123-26; 28:31-33; see 9:137-38; 11:82-96;\n\n19:33-50; DX404. Without the frozen-cutoff wall, neither Milestone-A nor the\n\nremainder of the wharf could be constructed in the dry. 9:137-38; 11:85-86; p.7,\n\n20.   There was no viable alternate cutoff wall.     46:83; p.20.   This demand\n\nconstituted a direction to perform additional work, because—as PHA knew,\n\n40:131; 46:133-34; PX373.0003; PX461—building the wharf in the wet would\n\ntake far more time and money than building it in the dry, id.; 10:62; 29:40-42;\n\n\n                                       17\n\f33:6; 47:60-61; 52:31, 102; 61:110.\n\n       Zachry refuted PHA’s assertion that Zachry voluntarily switched to working\n\nin the wet because it could not meet the schedule using the freeze-walls. In late\n\nSeptember/early October, Zachry was still projecting a March 22 Milestone-A\n\ncompletion. 18:116-18; DX404. But PHA knew—based on reports from PHA’s\n\non-site inspectors and Zachry’s scheduler—that Zachry could finish Milestone-A\n\nby the February 15 deadline and that schedules showing a March 22 completion\n\nwere a “paperwork trail” preserving Zachry’s claim for extension of time based on\n\nthe global-cement shortage.5        PX251; PX252; PX283; 26:100-02; 45:103-05;\n\n65:92-93, 99-100, 105; pp.9-10.\n\n       Three days after PHA’s rejection, Mageau projected Zachry could finish\n\nMilestone-A by the February 15 deadline and certainly by March 22—before the\n\ncrane-ship’s arrival. PX320; 30:115-16; 32:105-06. And Larry Applegate, the\n\nfreeze-wall subcontractor’s president, stated on November 11, 2005 that freeze-\n\ndown Phase 1 could begin immediately with the remainder starting by\n\nThanksgiving. PX360.0002; 33:47, 50-54. Mageau and Anderson agreed, despite\n\nfreeze-pipe-related and other challenges Zachry faced. 18:105-11; 30:115-18;\n\n32:100-01; PX320. This would have allowed Zachry to finish Milestone-A before\n5\n  Anderson’s comment post-Hurricane Rita that there wasn’t “a snowball’s chance in hell of\nhaving that wharf open by March...’cause the math don’t work,’” DX1157A, referred to Zachry’s\n9-day extension request for hurricane-caused delays. 19:113-15. Adding 9 working days to the\nprojected March 22 date pushed completion into April. Id.\n\n                                             18\n\fthe crane-ship arrived. 19:43-45.\n\n      PHA points to schedules Zachry created on October 31 purportedly showing\n\nZachry finishing much later than projected in its October 3 schedule. But the\n\nOctober 31 schedules were unfinished, non-concurrent schedules: they listed tasks\n\nend-to-end rather than accurately reflecting concurrent performance, thereby\n\nappearing artificially lengthy. 40:45-47, 55. See PX779.0005; PX777.0005;\n\nPX780.0005; 18:119-23; 19:50-55; 28:11-13, 16.\n\n      More importantly, these schedules were brain-storming exercises created\n\nafter PHA’s October 11 rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall that PHA knew was\n\n“required” to allow Zachry to meet the Milestone-A deadline. See pp.7, 8, 11.\n\nWithout the frozen-cutoff wall, it was difficult for Zachry to create schedules\n\nwithout knowing its means and methods. 19:38-43; 40:69-79; 46:67.          Zachry\n\ncreated 38 draft schedules in an attempt to determine which construction method to\n\nuse. 11:83-87; 40:70-71; PX373. Unlike the pre-October 11 schedules, none used\n\na frozen-cutoff wall under the wharf—thus confirming its rejection. 18:124-25;\n\n35:101; 46:76-82; see 28:22, 31-33.\n\n      PHA contends the schedules showed Zachry would finish soonest by\n\nremoving the main freeze-wall and working in the wet. PHASupp:12. But these\n\nschedules were the result of PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall—combined\n\nwith the lack of a viable alternate-cutoff wall.   Zachry’s alternate-cutoff-wall\n\n\n                                       19\n\fschedule projected a later finish date because the alternative method of building the\n\ncutoff wall was still “unidentified,” and Zachry had to project extra time to design\n\nit, procure materials, and build it. PX779; 40:45, 48; 46:91. Zachry quickly\n\ndetermined an alternate cutoff wall was not viable, because there were serious\n\ndoubts it could be designed and no time to implement it, given the imminent\n\nMilestone-A deadline. 19:38-50; 28:22; 46:78-79, 90-92. Indeed, when Mageau\n\ndelivered an alternate-cutoff-wall design on November 16, it was unworkable,\n\nunsafe, and could have damaged piers. 11:50, 52-58; 19:45-50; 42:64-67, 77-79,\n\n91-98; PX366; PX931 at 19-21; see 58:107-08.\n\n      PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall made meeting the Contract\n\ndeadlines “an impossible task,” in light of the wharf extension. 19:57-60. Without\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry would now have to complete the entire main freeze-\n\nwall, freeze it, and excavate the entire 2,000 feet of the now-extended wharf by the\n\nMilestone-A deadline, 28:33-34—all of which would take far longer than the prior\n\nplan of completing only the Milestone-A area. 11:45-49; 32:131-33. For this\n\nreason, someone at Zachry noted on November 3 that—in the absence of the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall—the main “freezewall” was “killing [the] baseline schedule.”\n\nDX82.006; 19:56-58.\n\n      Given PHA’s rejection and recovery-schedule demands, Zachry’s only hope\n\nof meeting the Milestone-A deadline was to use the unfrozen berm as a seawall as\n\n\n                                         20\n\flong as possible, completing Milestone-A and excavating under the wharf as\n\nquickly as possible, then breaching the berm for the crane-ship’s arrival and\n\nfinishing the remainder in the wet. 11:87-89.       The Supreme Court correctly\n\nconcluded that, following the R&R Order, “Zachry’s only option was to finish the\n\nwestern-most sections in time for the ship from China to dock, then remove the\n\nwall altogether and continue to work ‘in the wet,’ which would delay completion\n\nof the project and increase its cost.” 449 S.W.3d at 103(A3).\n\n      Having now deprived Zachry of its freeze-wall methods, PHA grew\n\nconcerned about its liability. 24:70-73. It met with lawyers, and on November 18\n\ntold Zachry, “[i]n accordance with...[§]5.10,” PHA had no right to interfere with\n\nZachry’s methods. PX18; 46:123-24. But PHA did not withdraw its rejection.\n\n46:126. Instead, PHA insisted PHA’s lawyers choose from among the schedule\n\noptions, and they chose an in-the-wet schedule with a May 28 Milestone-A\n\ncompletion date. PX367.002; PX373.0002, PX380; 19:66-71; 40:120-22, 128.\n\n      On January 16, 2006, Zachry sent PHA a letter confirming its change to\n\nworking in the wet was the “direct result” of PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, recovery-schedule demands, and LD threats. PX20.0003.\n\nVIII. Working in the wet causes Zachry substantial damages for which it\n      sues.\n      Zachry worked in the dry behind the berm as long as possible. 47:47-58.\n\nAfter it was breached, Zachry completed the wharf in the wet under “nightmare”\n\n                                        21\n\fconditions, excavating and placing revetment underwater beneath the deck with\n\nalmost zero visibility. 29:40-42; 40:131; 47:79.\n\n      Zachry sufficiently completed Milestone-A to allow the crane-ship to dock\n\nupon arrival May 15, 2006. 11:117; 40:131-33; 47:68-69; PX893.0076. Yet PHA\n\nback-charged Zachry $2.36 million in LDs from the Milestone-A deadline forward,\n\nalthough PHA incurred no demurrage. 40:131-32; 45:72-73. McQueen admitted\n\nthis was contrary to his promise. 28:73-74.\n\n      In October 2008, Zachry substantially completed the project. 47:80-81;\n\nPX578. Despite heavy losses, Zachry sought only damages caused by PHA’s\n\nbreach—the increased cost of construction as a result of PHA’s delays and forcing\n\nZachry to work in the wet earlier than it otherwise would have. 47:86-87.\n\n      After a three-month trial, the jury found PHA failed to comply with CO4\n\nand §5.10, causing Zachry $18,602,697 in damages. CR59:17390-93(A4). The\n\njudgment awarded those damages, plus $2.36 million PHA withheld as LDs, minus\n\na $970,000 offset for wharf fenders, for a recovery of $19,992,697, plus interest.\n\nCR62:18166(A1).\n\n      This Court, based on its holdings that the no-damages-for-delay clause\n\nprecludes Zachry’s recovery and that PHA’s release defense barred Zachry’s\n\nrecovery of the LDs, reversed and rendered judgment that Zachry take nothing and\n\nPHA recover $10,500,000 in attorney’s fees, plus contingent appellate fees. 377\n\n\n                                        22\n\fS.W.3d at 865(A2).\n\n      The Supreme Court held governmental immunity did not bar Zachry’s\n\nclaims, reversed this Court’s judgment regarding the no-damages-for-delay clause\n\nand LDs, and remanded. 449 S.W.3d at 119-20(A3).\n\n\n\n\n                                      23\n\f                         SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      The Supreme Court rejected PHA’s main appellate points—immunity, no-\n\ndamages-for-delay, and release. PHA is left with a laundry list of second-tier\n\narguments that largely invite this Court to revisit evidentiary disputes resolved by\n\nthe jury, issues committed to the trial court’s discretion, and issues the Supreme\n\nCourt previously decided against PHA. PHA’s invitation should be declined.\n\n      In Questions 1 and 2, the jury properly rejected PHA’s contrived reading of\n\nCO4 and §5.10. Unlike Zachry, PHA offers no interpretation that harmonizes all\n\nContract provisions and satisfies PHA’s business purpose—to avoid liability from\n\ncontrol of Zachry’s methods. PHA’s challenge to the damages and causation\n\nfindings in Question 3 likewise ignores the substantial evidence supporting them.\n\n      Nor do Contract §§5.41/5.42 bar Zachry’s claims. These “changes” clauses\n\nplainly allow PHA to change the scope of the Work during Contract performance.\n\nThey do not govern Zachry’s rights in the event of a PHA breach. If they did, they\n\nwould be inapplicable under common-law and statutory rules.\n\n      PHA’s remaining arguments are also without merit. The trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in rejecting PHA’s eleventh-hour attempts to inject $8.6\n\nmillion of claimed “harms” into the case. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court held,\n\nthe trial court properly instructed the jury on the no-damages-for-delay exceptions,\n\nincluding recklessness. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding\n\n\n                                        24\n\fZachry pleaded apparent authority, and its instruction was proper. And PHA is not\n\nentitled to attorneys’ fees so long as the judgment awards Zachry damages.\n\nFinally, PHA’s attempt to deny Zachry pass-through recovery for the work of its\n\nsubcontractor—a    Zachry entity created     during   corporate   restructuring—\n\ncontravenes Interstate Contracting v.

Ample evidence supports the jury’s breach-of-contract findings.\n      PHA contends the Contract and CO4 unambiguously authorized PHA to\n\nissue the R&R Order barring Zachry’s freeze-wall means and methods.

Nor does PHA “construe [the] contract[] from a utilitarian standpoint\n\nbearing in mind the particular business activity sought to be served.” Id.

Bay Area\n\nBank & Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336260\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336260/mccreary-v-bay-area-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 731-32 (Tex.App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet.\n\ndism’d).\n\n      Applying these principles, there is only one reasonable interpretation: PHA\n\nhad no right to issue the R&R Order.         At a minimum, Zachry’s reading is\n\nreasonable, and ample evidence supported the jury findings in Questions 1 and 2.\n\n      A.    Section 5.10 prohibited PHA’s R&R Order, and no other\n            Contract provision authorized it.\n\n            1.     Section 5.10 forbids PHA control of Zachry’s means and\n                   methods.\n      Section 5.10 plainly barred PHA from controlling Zachry’s means and\n\nmethods, which undisputedly included the frozen-cutoff wall. See p.4. It stated,\n\n“[PHA] shall not have the right to control the manner in which or prescribe the\n\n\n                                        26\n\fmethod by which the Contractor performs the Work,” and that Zachry was “an\n\nindependent Contractor…solely responsible for the supervision and performance of\n\nthe Work…in such manner, using such methods as Contractor shall choose.”\n\nDX1-1.0214(A13).\n\n      This prohibition on PHA control was not “subject to” the “proviso” at the\n\nend of §5.10, PHASupp:1: it merely clarified that Zachry’s right to choose its\n\nmethods did not eliminate its obligation to comply with the Contract. DX1-1.0214,\n\n§5.10(A13) (“…provided, however…the order, time, manner and methods of\n\nprosecution shall be…in accordance with the Contract Documents”). When the\n\nR&R Order was issued, Zachry was in compliance with the Contract; PHA does\n\nnot argue otherwise.\n\n      As discussed below, some Contract provisions allowed PHA to receive\n\nmeans-and-methods-related submittals.        However, none authorized PHA to\n\nexercise control over Zachry’s methods by barring Zachry from using them and\n\nordering Zachry to revise them. Arguing these clauses granted PHA such control\n\nfails to harmonize all Contract provisions and renders §5.10’s prohibition on PHA\n\ncontrol meaningless. It also vitiates PHA’s business purpose: “insulating [PHA]\n\nfrom liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising control over\n\nZachry’s work.” 449 S.W.3d at 102 & n.4(A3); see pp.4-5. Finally, PHA’s\n\n\n\n\n                                        27\n\fargument improperly gives controlling weight to general provisions relating to\n\nsubmittals, like §5.22, rather than specific provisions, like §5.10.\n\n             2.     Section 4.07 forbids PHA control over Zachry’s health-and-\n                    safety plans.\n      Contract §4.07 required Zachry to submit a health-and-safety plan to PHA,\n\nbut made clear PHA could not control it:\n\n      Notwithstanding the Chief Engineer’s review of the health and safety\n      plan, the Contractor, and not the Port Authority, shall be responsible\n      for and have control over ensuring the safety of its personnel and its\n      Subcontractors…\n\nDX1-1.0204(A13).\n\n      Zachry agreed to submit the main freeze-wall design as a shoring-safety-\n\nplan addendum to its previously filed health-and-safety plan, “in accord[] with\n\nTechnical Specification [‘T.S.’]02161(1.3)” and “conforming to OSHA standards,\n\nwith a statement signed and sealed by a registered Professional Engineer licensed\n\nin…Texas.” PX86; see DX1-1.0325, §1.3(A14); PX93.0007; 21:78; 6:60.\n\n      T.S.02161 required the shoring-safety plan to include details about the\n\nContractor’s means and methods but did not authorize PHA to control them. DX1-\n\n1.0325, §1.3(A14).     Nor could it: T.S.02161 was expressly “[s]ubject to the\n\nGeneral and Special Conditions,” which included §5.10 and §4.07. DX1-1.0324,\n\n§1.1(A14). Instead of PHA approval, T.S.02161 required Zachry to obtain a Texas\n\nPE’s approval. Id. The purpose of this review was to ensure the shoring plan\n\n\n                                          28\n\fsatisfied OSHA safety rules, so the wall would not harm workers; as PHA\n\nwitnesses testified, it did not allow PHA to approve or reject the wall based on any\n\npurported effect on the wharf. 6:62-67; 7:62; 20:111; 27:19-21; 37:106-07. The\n\nTexas PE’s approval ensured PHA would not be liable for Zachry’s activities.\n\n44:90.\n\n         Consistent with §4.07 and §5.10, PHA did not “approve” the original freeze-\n\nwall design, but rather “accepted [it] for records” based on the Texas PE’s\n\ncertification. 37:115-16, 120-21; 37:114-16; 38:5-6, 156-57; 44:100-01, 109-11;\n\n45:32; PX88(A19). PHA’s witnesses testified PHA did not approve or reject the\n\noriginal freeze-wall or safety submittals to avoid claims it controlled Zachry’s\n\nmethods and any attendant liability. 37:115; 44:95-97. No one contemplated PHA\n\ncould approve or order Zachry to revise its main freeze-wall plan: Zachry built it\n\nand installed freeze-pipes before giving PHA the design. 44:110-11.\n\n               3.    None of PHA’s other cited provisions authorize the R&R\n                     Order.\n         Section 5.22. Although §5.22 allowed PHA to “review” Submittals “to\n\ndetermine whether Contractor is complying with…the Contract Documents,” it did\n\nnot authorize PHA to control Zachry’s means and methods—contrary to §5.10—by\n\nrejecting them.\n\n         Consistent with §5.10 and §4.07, §5.22 specifically forbade PHA to approve\n\nZachry’s safety plan or means and methods: “The Port Authority’s…review and\n\n                                          29\n\facceptance of the Contractor’s Submittals shall not constitute approval of safety\n\nprecautions or any construction means, methods….” DX1-1.0220(A13); 6:70-71.\n\nThus, §5.22 insulated PHA from liability for Zachry’s methods. 6:57, 71.\n\n      In contrast, §5.22 did not disclaim PHA’s right to approve Submittals\n\nrelating to matters PHA was authorized to control under the Contract: Submittals\n\nrelating to the “Work.” Section 5.22 required Zachry to provide submittals to\n\nPHA’s Design Consultant, DMJM, “showing all materials and details of Work to\n\nbe incorporated into the Project.” DX1-1.0218(A13). “Work” was defined as “the\n\nconstruction” and “services” “required by the Contract” or “pursuant to the\n\nContract.” DX1-1.0190, §1.42. Thus, the wharf and any contractually specified\n\nmeans and methods—for example, the Technical Specification requiring a\n\nparticular method for vibrating concrete pours—would be part of the “Work” and\n\nsubject to PHA approval. 6:47, 53-55; 9:36-37; 21:33; DX1-10430. This ensured\n\nthe permanent Work (wharf) was built according to the Contract specifications.\n\n6:58-59; 8:11.\n\n      In contrast, Zachry’s chosen means and methods—the freeze-walls—were\n\nnot required by the Contract, 20:96; 37:66, 99; 44:78, would not be part of the\n\nWork, 21:33, 63; 27:11, and would not be required Submittals under this clause,\n\n6:54-57, 59, 74-75; 21:71-73; 37:99. In August 2004, Thiess confirmed this:\n\n“[r]egarding the freeze wall, we have no requirement for a submittal as it was not\n\n\n                                       30\n\fanticipated by the designers.” PX84(A18). PHA’s designer refused to approve any\n\nfreeze-wall, because it was Zachry’s means and methods. 20:110-11; 44:95;\n\nPX93.0007.    Submittals relating to Zachry’s safety plan and methods were\n\ncontrolled by §5.22’s prohibition on PHA approval.\n\n      T.S.01500. Although T.S.01500 required Zachry to protect the Work, it did\n\nnot authorize the R&R Order. DX1-1.0271, §1.1A(A15); 27:29-30. T.S.01500\n\nwas “[s]ubject to the General and Special Conditions,” DX1-1.0271, §1.1A(A15);\n\nsee DX1-1.0191, §2.02(a)(A13), including §5.10’s bar on PHA control, and §4.07\n\nand §5.22’s prohibition of PHA approval of Zachry’s safety plans and methods.\n\nConsistent with PHA’s goal of avoiding liability, T.S.01500 required Zachry to fix\n\nany damage “done by, or on account of...the Contractor.” DX1-1.0278,\n\n§1.11A.4(A15). PHA’s argument grants PHA control, destroying this protection.\n\n      Section 1.39. Nothing in §1.39 authorized PHA to order Zachry to revise\n\nZachry’s means and methods. It defined “Submittals” as “information provided\n\nby [Zachry] for approval of proposed Equipment, Materials, means or methods.”\n\nDX1-1.0189(A13). Critically, §5.22 prohibited PHA from approving Zachry’s\n\nmeans and methods (as opposed to contractually specified methods). See pp.29-\n\n31. Thus, any submission of Zachry’s methods was not “information provided by\n\n[Zachry] for approval.” And reading §1.39’s general “Submittal” definition to\n\nauthorize the R&R Order improperly allows §1.39 to control over §5.10 and\n\n\n                                       31\n\f§4.07’s specific prohibitions on PHA control.\n\n            4.     PHA is not remediless.\n      PHA contends Zachry’s argument deprives PHA of any recourse if PHA\n\nbelieved Zachry’s means and methods “could cause the Wharf to collapse.”\n\nPHASupp:25.      Even if such a belief could authorize the R&R Order, ample\n\nevidence established PHA did not actually or reasonably believe the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall could cause wharf collapse. See pp.13-15.\n\n      Furthermore, the Contract contains numerous provisions allocating to\n\nZachry the risk of damage from Zachry’s methods and providing PHA a remedy.\n\nSee, e.g., DX1-1.0198, .0200, .0223, .0229, .0234, §§ 3.06, 3.08, 5.36, 5.53,\n\n6.14(A13); DX1-1.0278, §1.11A.4(A15); 9:33-35; 27:13-18, 23-25. And if PHA\n\nwere truly concerned about wharf collapse, it could terminate the Contract without\n\ncause. DX1-1.0227, §5.47(A13). The one thing the Contract did not allow PHA\n\nto do was control Zachry’s means and methods by issuing the R&R Order. PHA\n\ndrafted the Contract, pp.3-4, and the Court should not rewrite it to grant PHA\n\nrights omitted from it and contrary to PHA’s business purpose.\n\n            5.     The drilled-shaft submittal is consistent with Zachry’s\n                   reading.\n      PHA suggests Zachry’s drilled-shaft submittal shows PHA’s right to issue\n\nthe R&R Order. PHASupp:2. But it related only to piers—which were part of the\n\n“Work,” which PHA had the right to approve—not Zachry’s freeze-wall methods,\n\n                                        32\n\fwhich PHA had no right to approve. See PX6; PX69; 7:45; pp.26-32. PHA\n\nrecognized this, warning “any ice…encountered during drilled-shaft construction\n\nwill be cause for rejecting the affected work”—not Zachry’s freeze-wall methods.\n\nDX133.002\n\n         B.    PHA’s R&R Order breached CO4.\n\n         PHA argues CO4 did not “delete PHA’s §5.22 right to require Zachry to\n\nrevise and resubmit Zachry’s frozen-COW design.” PHASupp:25. But §5.22\n\nafforded no such right. See pp.29-31.\n\n         Even if PHA had such a right, ample evidence supported the jury’s finding\n\nthat PHA agreed in CO4 that Zachry could use the frozen-cutoff wall, and CO4\n\ncontrols. DX1-1.0191, §2.02(a)(A13).\n\n         CO4 incorporated “Proposer’s Specifications and Proposal dated April 13,\n\n2005, as amended by Proposals for 330 feet Wharf Extension [the May 18\n\nproposal, 26:110-12] and as further amended by Proposer’s Supplemental Proposal\n\ndated July 11, 2005….”          PX12.0001, .0004(A30).       Both the April and May\n\nproposals were conditioned on an “[u]ninterrupted work schedule” and the “freeze\n\nwall-cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) ‘B’ row piling”—the same one described\n\nto PHA representatives on April 5 and memorialized in the September 9 design.\n\nPX9(A21); PX179(A22); pp.8, 11. 6 The July 11 proposal did not delete these\n\n\n6\n    PHA’s claim it rejected the April 13 proposal is immaterial. The May 18 proposal—which\n                                             33\n\fconditions: it was merely a “[s]upplemental proposal” that offered “additions and\n\nclarifications.” PX219(A23); 8:60; 10:116. PHA signed CO4 after reviewing the\n\nSeptember 9 design—which embodied the April 5 design described in the\n\nproposals—for two weeks. 10:111-16, 118, 8:50-51; 22:92, 119-20; 27:37; 45:148;\n\np.13. 7     Thus, CO4 included PHA’s agreement that Zachry could use the frozen-\n\ncutoff wall. See pp.12-13.\n\n          PHA concedes CO4 is at least ambiguous as to Zachry’s right to use the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall, but argues there is “no intent evidence.” PHASupp:27. CO4’s\n\nlanguage incorporating the April and May proposals refutes this. Furthermore,\n\nZachry’s Anderson testified CO4 “included language with the frozen-cutoff wall”\n\nand “expressly said that we had the right to use it as a result of this change order.”\n\n15:61. PHA cites nothing for its argument CO4 did not bind the parties if it\n\nauthorized, but did not require, Zachry to use the frozen-cutoff wall.\n\n          Thus, the evidence supports the jury’s finding that CO4 authorized Zachry to\n\nuse the frozen-cutoff wall. PHA does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nof breach under this interpretation to support Question 1, because it cannot. See\n\npp.15-16.\n\nPHA does not claim was rejected—was also conditioned on the frozen-cutoff wall.\nPX179(A22). Furthermore, PHA cites nothing holding a previously rejected proposal cannot be\nincorporated into an agreement.\n7\n PHA’s irrelevant claim that Zachry changed its theory on CO4 is disproved by PHA’s citations.\nCR31:8541; 1(9/11/09):27, 80.\n\n                                             34\n\f       C.     Question 1 was proper.\n\n       The instruction in Question 1 that the jury was “not being asked to decide\n\nwhether PHA failed to comply with §5.10” was necessary to obtain separate\n\nfindings on whether CO4 gave Zachry the right to use the frozen-cutoff wall\n\n(Question 1) and whether §5.10 barred PHA from issuing the R&R Order\n\n(Question 2). CR59:17390(A4). The instruction was within the court’s broad\n\ndiscretion. Kiefer v.

The jury's verdict on causation and damages is supported by the\n       evidence.\n       Given the evidence that PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall, demands\n\nfor a recovery schedule, and threats of LDs caused Zachry to switch to working in\n\nthe wet, pp.16-21, the remaining issue was the quantification of the effect of the\n\nswitch (damages). 51:152-54; 52:4-10. Zachry’s damages expert, Gary Draper,\n\ntestified about that quantification; he did not also need to opine on the cause of the\n\nswitch. Id.; p.40.\n\n8\n  Question 1 should never have been submitted: CO4 unambiguously authorizes Zachry to use\nthe frozen-cutoff wall, pp.12-13, 33-34, and PHA does not dispute breach under this reading,\np.34. Zachry was entitled to a directed verdict. CR59:17299-313.\n\n                                            35\n\f      Draper (a) identified the construction activities the switch impacted; (b) as to\n\neach impacted activity, calculated the cost Zachry would have incurred absent\n\nPHA’s breach working in the dry as long as possible; (c) compared those costs to\n\nthe costs Zachry reasonably incurred as a result of switching to the wet earlier than\n\nit would have absent PHA’s breach; and (d) excluded all other costs. 52:4-10, 16,\n\n26, 72-74, 103-111; 117:172, 261. Draper calculated the costs of the switch (after\n\nexcluding other costs) to be approximately $27 million. 52:7-10, 110-11. After\n\nhearing the evidence, the jury awarded Zachry $18,602,697. CR59:17393(A4).\n\n      A.     Draper’s assumptions on damages were supported by the\n             evidence and did not vary materially from undisputed facts.\n      PHA incorrectly asserts the assumptions underlying Draper’s model failed to\n\ncomply with Burroughs Wellcome v. Crye, which holds that experts may not\n\n“assume[] facts that vary materially from the actual, undisputed facts.”          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742776\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742776/burroughs-wellcome-co-v-crye/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499 (Tex. 1995).\n\n      PHA ignores the substantial evidence supporting Draper’s model, and\n\ninstead asserts Draper’s dry schedule “varies drastically” from “dozens of\n\nschedules Zachry prepared around the time of the” Port’s rejection. PHASupp:29.\n\nBut Draper scheduled a frozen-cutoff-wall methodology. 52:8. In contrast, the\n\nschedules PHA cites were not based on a frozen-cutoff wall, because they were\n\ncreated after the rejection. See PHASupp:29; p.19-20. Thus, these schedules did\n\nnot even attempt to project what Draper projected—a completion schedule using a\n\n                                         36\n\ffrozen-cutoff wall.    Moreover, because they were drafts, they did not reflect\n\nconcurrent performance of tasks to accurately project completion dates. 11:49-50,\n\n83-86; 18:124-25, 151-57; 19:32-60; p.19.\n\n      PHA’s other challenges to Draper’s assumptions—regarding freeze-pipe\n\nremoval and sheet-pile installation—ignore evidence supporting Draper’s\n\nassumptions and do not show his assumptions vary materially from undisputed\n\nevidence.\n\n               1.    Draper’s treatment of freeze-pipe removal was supported\n                     by the evidence.\n      PHA incorrectly asserts the “undisputed” evidence showed freeze-pipe\n\nremoval would occur prior to berm removal and in a manner that would add a\n\nmaterial amount of time to Draper’s overall dry schedule.\n\n      First, Draper’s dry model—consistent with the evidence—provided for\n\nfreeze-pipe removal to occur concurrently with berm removal. 53:31-32; PX320;\n\n30:106-08, 116-17.\n\n            • Zachry’s dry approach was to remove the berm and freeze-pipes\n\n               simultaneously and using the same equipment.      53:31-32; 10:61;\n\n               DX404.004.\n\n            • PHA’s own freeze-wall expert at trial, Mageau, concluded at the time\n\n               of the R&R Order that Zachry could remove the freeze-pipes and\n\n               perform the remainder of the work by mid-February to mid-March\n\n                                         37\n\f             2006 so the crane-ship could timely dock—even though he was aware\n\n             of freeze-pipe issues and other challenges Zachry faced.    PX320;\n\n             30:106-08, 116-17; pp.18-19.\n\n           • Draper’s schedule was consistent with the contemporaneous frozen-\n\n             cutoff-wall project schedule created by Zachry shortly before the\n\n             rejection. DX404; 18:115-18, 124.\n\n      Second, even if freeze-pipe removal would occur separately from berm\n\nremoval, it would account for no more than one day of the critical path of the\n\nschedule: the day after pipe-removal started, Zachry would begin the more time-\n\nconsuming critical-path activity of berm removal where the pipes had been\n\nremoved.      After the first day, pipe and berm removal would proceed\n\nsimultaneously. 53:29-30. Draper included sufficient “float” to accommodate this.\n\nId.; 54:91-93.\n\n      PHA incorrectly characterizes Draper’s testimony as “assum[ing] a thousand\n\nfreeze-pipes could be removed in one day.” PHASupp:31 (emphasis original).\n\nPHA’s suggestion that Draper should have scheduled more than one day to remove\n\npipes incorrectly assumes that pipe and berm removal could not occur\n\nconcurrently. See, e.g., 53:31-32; 10:61; DX404.004.\n\n      Third, PHA cross-examined Draper on this point, and the jury’s award––\n\nsubstantially less than Zachry sought––accounted for any weight the jury gave it.\n\n                                       38\n\f53:29-32; America’s Favorite Chicken Co. v.

Draper’s treatment of sheet-pile installation was supported\n                     by the evidence.\n       PHA contends “it is undisputed…Zachry was not ready to install…sheet pile\n\nuntil after November 15—40 days later than Draper assumed.” PHASupp:31. 9\n\nBut PHA’s citations provide no support.          PHA relies on Anderson’s testimony\n\nreferencing a November 15 list of remaining tasks. Neither that list nor\n\nAnderson’s testimony references sheet-pile-installation timing for the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, because it was rejected a month earlier. See DX91; 16:29-31; 14:93-104.\n\nPHA nevertheless inserts “frozen” into Anderson’s testimony “that there was work\n\nto be done before we were ready for the [frozen] cutoff wall.” PHASupp:31. But\n\nAnderson was discussing the status as of November 15—when Zachry was\n\nconsidering the alternate-cutoff wall’s viability. See p.19-20. PHA’s argument\n\nincorrectly   assumes      that,   after   PHA's     October    11    rejection,    Zachry\n\nproceeded exactly as if PHA had not breached. See, e.g., 16:135-36; 54:91.\n\n       Even if Anderson was saying work remained as of October 11, Anderson\n\ntestified it would take “a couple of days at best.” 14:103; see 16:30. Although\n\nDraper’s schedules showed sheet-pile installation starting October 7, it was on\n\n9\n  “Sheet pile”—steel sheets—would have lined the frozen-cutoff wall berm and would have\ncomposed Mageau’s alternate-cutoff wall. 10:21-22; 11:52-53.\n\n\n\n                                            39\n\f“early start,” meaning it could start later with no impact on his analysis. 53:159-\n\n60; 54:91-94; PX580 at 273. Indeed, his schedule’s float allowed sheet-pile\n\ninstallation to be delayed until November 15 or later. Id. The evidence supports\n\nDraper’s assumption that—absent the breach—Zachry could have accomplished\n\npre-freeze-down work like sheet-pile installation in time to freeze-down the walls\n\nand complete Milestone-A before the crane-ship arrived. See pp.18-19; 52:14-15.\n\n      Third, PHA raised this issue during Anderson’s cross-examination, and the\n\njury’s award––less than Zachry sought––accounted for any weight the jury gave it.\n\n16:29-31; Samaras, 929 S.W.2d at 629.\n\n      B.    The evidence establishes causation.\n            1.     Ample evidence supported the jury’s causation finding.\n      Contrary to PHA’s assertion, expert testimony was not required to prove\n\nPHA’s breach caused Zachry to abandon its dry-construction methodology.

PHA’s “Contract completion deadline” argument fails.\n      PHA asserts Draper did not opine that Zachry could have met the Contract\n\ndeadlines by working in the dry with the frozen-cutoff wall. PHASupp:34-35. But\n\nZachry was not required to show it would have completed all its work in the dry by\n\nthe Contract deadlines to prove the R&R Order caused Zachry’s damages. The\n\njury could have reasonably found a causal connection between PHA’s breach and\n\nthe damages awarded based on evidence showing PHA’s breach caused Zachry to\n\nuse a wet approach for a far greater portion of the work than if Zachry had been\n\nallowed to use the frozen-cutoff wall. 52:41-43, 94-97, 102-07; p.17-18; Abraxis\n\nPetrol Corp. v.

PHA’s contention that Zachry failed to prove causation\n\nbecause Draper’s model assumed a small amount of work in the wet is unfounded.\n\n      But even if required, Zachry presented ample evidence it would have\n\ncompleted Milestone-A in the dry by February 15, 2006, if PHA had not rejected\n\nthe frozen-cutoff wall. See, e.g., PX320; 30:115-16; PX357; 19:43-45; 18:107-11;\n10\n   PHA’s argument that Zachry’s schedules showed Zachry finishing faster and cheaper by\nabandoning its dry methodology was debunked at trial. See pp.19-20, 36-37.\n\n                                          41\n\f32:100-01; PX893.0055; PX251; PX252; 26:100-02; 45:103-05; see also 29:35-36,\n\n115-16; 123-24; pp.18-19. 11 Other evidence showed that absent PHA’s breach,\n\nZachry could have completed Milestone-A by May 15, 2006—the crane-ship’s\n\nactual arrival date, see, e.g., id.; 56:96-97; pp.18-19,—and achieved final\n\ncompletion by the Contract deadline, 16:102-04; PX771; 19:86-90; 18:115-18;\n\n27:40-42; 35:57-58.        PHA ignores this evidence and that Draper adopted a\n\nconservative approach in preparing his analysis. 52:60-63.\n\n               3.     PHA’s “alternative cause” argument fails.\n       PHA incorrectly argues Draper “failed to rule out alternative causes of\n\nZachry’s switch to working ‘in the wet.’” PHASupp:33. Expert testimony was not\n\nrequired to rule out alternative causes. See p.40.\n\n       PHA’s suggestion Zachry was planning on eliminating the freeze-wall was\n\nrefuted by evidence establishing that, until the R&R Order, Zachry intended to use\n\nthe freeze-walls and was building the wharf and freeze-walls consistent with that\n\nintent. See 10:99-102, 118, 124; 19:33; 35:63. Anderson testified that in the\n\nabsence of an alternative-cutoff wall, Zachry’s only option was to work in the wet.\n\n18:151-57; 19:32-50; see also pp.17, 19-21. And geotechnical expert Lacy offered\n\nunrebutted expert testimony that the alternative-cutoff wall design was not safe or\n\n11\n   Anderson also testified about scheduling and construction progress in light of his construction\nexperience and first-hand observation of the work. 9:81-86, 94, 101-02, 109-110; 11:49-50, 82-\n86, 91-93; 12:111; 18:64-65, 115-25, 151-57; 19:32-76. Anderson testified Zachry would have\ntimely completed the project with the frozen-cutoff wall. 19:43-45.\n\n                                               42\n\ffeasible. 42:59-104. The jury could reasonably have found that—in the absence of\n\na viable alternative method to bifurcate construction and allow the crane-ship to\n\ndock—PHA’s rejection of the frozen-cutoff wall, demands that Zachry comply\n\nwith the Contract deadlines, and threats of LDs forced Zachry to switch to a\n\npredominantly wet methodology earlier than it otherwise would have. See pp.16-\n\n21.\n\n         Finally, PHA’s argument that Anderson offered conclusory testimony lacks\n\nmerit.        Anderson was questioned for days regarding scheduling options he\n\nanalyzed after PHA’s breach.        See, e.g., 11:49-50, 83-86; 18:124-25, 151-57;\n\n19:32-45, 50-60. Anderson’s contemporaneously prepared schedules showed that,\n\nwithout a frozen-cutoff wall, Zachry could only dock the crane-ship if it moved to\n\nwet construction far earlier than planned. Id.\n\n         C.      PHA’s lack-of-authority argument does not defeat causation.\n         PHA contends that because “Thiess had no authority [under Special\n\nCondition §12(d)] to change Contract terms, Thiess’s R&R response could\n\nnot…have caused Zachry’s R&R damages.” PHASupp:38-39. However, §12(d) is\n\ninapplicable: the R&R Order was not a change to the Contract, but a breach. Cf.\n\np.45-48.\n\n         Furthermore, PHA’s argument is based on the incorrect premise that “Thiess\n\nissued the R&R response.” PHASupp:37.            The R&R Order, which bore PHA’s\n\n                                          43\n\fseal, was PHA’s decision and act; Thiess (with PHA’s McQueen) was simply\n\nPHA’s messenger. 8:16; 46:50-51, 53-54; PX266(A33); PX314(A34); DX1-\n\n1.0244, §12(c)(A16). The day before the R&R Order issued, PHA’s McQueen\n\ntold Thiess and Ely, “[t]he cutoff wall was rejected.” PX1(A32).          Vincent\n\nconcurred. 46:39.\n\n      But even if Thiess made the R&R-Order decision, it would still have been\n\nPHA’s act. Chief Engineer DeWolf testified he delegated his §5.22 authority to\n\nreview safety-related Submittals to PHA’s Vincent and McQueen, who were\n\nresponsible for getting CH2M-Hill’s assistance. 8:16. Apparent authority is a fact\n\nissue. See p.62.\n\n      Moreover, other PHA acts caused Zachry’s damages. Three days after the\n\nR&R Order’s issuance, Chief Engineer DeWolf sent Zachry a letter demanding\n\nZachry finish by the Contract deadlines (which were conditioned on use of the\n\nfrozen-cutoff wall) and threatening LDs. PX319; 19:29-31. DeWolf’s superiors\n\nrepeated this demand in October and November. See p.17. By demanding a\n\nrecovery schedule after barring Zachry from using its “required” frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, PHA—not Thiess—forced Zachry to spend more money and time building\n\nthe newly extended wharf in the wet. See pp.17-18, 21-22.\n\n      The Water Code and Chapter 271 impose no bar: the Contract PHA\n\nbreached was undisputedly written and properly executed as required by PHA’s\n\n\n                                       44\n\fcited statutes. See PHASupp:37-38 (citing TEX. WATER CODE §60.408(i); TEX.\n\nLOC. GOV’T CODE §§271.151(2), 271.152)(A42).\n\nIII.   Sections 5.41 and 5.42 do not bar Zachry’s breach-of-contract claim.\n\n       A.    The “changes” clauses are inapplicable by their terms.\n       By their plain terms, §5.41 and §5.42 do not apply to breach-of-contract\n\nclaims for damages. Instead, they set forth procedures allowing PHA to make\n\nchanges within the scope of the Work during performance of the Contract, either\n\nthrough     Change   Orders    (§5.41)   or    “Changed   Conditions    or    Contract\n\nInterpretations” (§5.42).\n\n       Section 5.41 applies to “changes and modifications to the Contract\n\nDocuments within the general scope of the Work,” and requires a Change Order to\n\n“stipulate the Work to be performed” and “any difference in the Contract Price.”\n\nDX1-1.0224-25(A13).         Similarly, §5.42 requires five days’ notice of any\n\n“interpretation of the Contract” by PHA “the Contractor believes...constitutes a\n\nchange to the Contract,” “[i]f the Contractor believes it is entitled to an adjustment\n\nin the Contract Time [or] Contract Price.”         DX1-1.0225(A13).          The Chief\n\nEngineer’s determination as to whether there should be a “modification” or\n\n“equitable adjustment” is “final and conclusive,” and the Contractor is forbidden to\n\n“begin performing that portion of the Work affected by such interpretation” before\n\ngiving notice. Id.\n\n\n                                          45\n\f        Zachry does not assert that in forbidding Zachry to use the frozen-cutoff\n\nwall, PHA effected “changes or modifications to the Contract Documents within\n\nthe general scope of the Work” as in §5.41, or that PHA made an “interpretation\n\nof the Contract” that “constitutes a change to the Contract” as in §5.42. Rather,\n\nPHA breached the Contract and CO4 by rejecting the frozen-cutoff wall. Thus,\n\nZachry never sought the “difference in the Contract Price” under §5.41 nor “an\n\nadjustment in the...Contract Price” under §5.42. Rather, Zachry sought—and the\n\njury properly awarded—damages for PHA’s breach of the Contract. CR29:08142-\n\n44(A8); CR59:17390-93(A4). Furthermore, §§5.41/5.42 apply only to changes\n\nrelating to “the Work,” which does not include Zachry’s means and methods. See\n\np.30.\n\n        Authorities recognize that “changes” clauses like §§5.41/5.42 do not apply\n\nto claims the owner breached and is liable for damages.

They did not\n\ngive Zachry notice that PHA intended to seek an $8.6 million jury finding on an\n\noffset defense to be deducted from Zachry’s damages award. An $8.6-million-\n\n                                       55\n\foffset claim would have required Zachry to conduct substantial discovery into\n\nwhether PHA sustained the harms, causation, and quantification.\n\n      From this suit’s beginning in 2006, Zachry sued for sums PHA wrongfully\n\nwithheld, including the $25,000/day LDs for Milestone-A.               CR1:00005;\n\nCR4:00934. When PHA disclosed—for the first time on June 3, 2009—that it\n\nsustained actual damages, its disclosure was solely in the context of arguing the\n\nLD provisions were a “reasonable forecast of just compensation because…the Port\n\nAuthority sustained actual damages in an amount that was not disproportionate to\n\nthe [LDs].” CR45:13023, ¶41(A9). The next day, PHA filed its Second Amended\n\nDisclosures stating PHA had suffered general categories of actual damages, but\n\nagain solely in the context of arguing the LD provisions were enforceable:\n\n       The difficulty of quantifying and proving…actual damages is\n       one…reason[] the parties included liquidated damages provisions in\n       the Contract…The [LD] provisions are enforceable….The [LDs]\n       were a reasonable forecast of just compensation because…[PHA]\n       sustained actual damages in an amount that is not disproportionate to\n       the [LDs] ….\n\nCR46:13076(A10).\n\n      Zachry immediately sent PHA an interrogatory on June 11 asking it to\n\nquantify these harms. CR46:13105(A11). That PHA responded by Zachry’s July\n\n24 deadline by quantifying more than $8 million in alleged actual harms does not\n\nhelp PHA: Zachry sent its interrogatory in response to PHA’s disclosure that it\n\nsuffered harm proportional to its LDs, and PHA’s response again referenced the\n                                        56\n\fdifficulty in “know[ing] the precise nature and extent of damages,” and did not\n\ndisclose it sought to offset them against Zachry’s damages. CR46:13108(A11);\n\nsee CR46:13105-10(A11). And PHA’s general, conclusory pleadings of an offset\n\ndefense failed to notify Zachry of the amount of damages PHA sought to offset.\n\nSee PHASupp:51 (citing CR47:13428, §57).\n\n      Even if these disclosures were not limited to LDs, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in excluding them as untimely. Trial had been scheduled to\n\nbegin July 20, 2009, and the discovery deadline had lapsed six months earlier, on\n\nJanuary 16. CR45:12933; CR17:04679. See Sprague v.

Nothing disclosed PHA intended to submit these harms to the\n\njury as an offset defense to reduce Zachry’s damages. Indeed, PHA’s September\n\n17 draft charge did not seek any finding as to PHA’s actual damages for an offset\n\ndefense to reduce Zachry’s damages award. See CR43:12401-20(A12).\n\n      Not until the eve of trial did PHA reveal it intended to seek an $8.6 million\n\nalleged-harms offset as a defense to reduce Zachry’s damages.

It also correctly found\n\nPHA failed to show good cause and that injection of the $8.6 million in alleged\n\nharms would require extensive discovery and “dramatically change the landscape\n\nof what promises to be a lengthy and complicated trial.” CR51:14951-52(A6).\n\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion.\n\nV.     PHA’s “open-the-door” theory did not support admission of PHA’s\n       alleged harms regarding the no-damages-for-delay exceptions.\n\n       A.    The trial court properly excluded PHA’s actual-harms evidence\n             under Rule 403.\n       PHA contends the trial court erred in refusing to allow PHA to prove—with\n\nrespect to the bad-faith and arbitrary-and-capricious no-damages-for-delay\n\nexceptions—that PHA suffered actual harm to rebut a purported “misimpression”\n\nZachry allegedly gave the jury. PHASupp:54-56.       But Zachry never opened the\n\ndoor to PHA’s claimed harm.\n\n       Zachry never argued PHA suffered no harm at all. Rather, Zachry argued\n\nPHA:\n\n       (1)   promised not to charge Milestone-A LDs if the crane-ship was able\n             to dock on arrival, but\n\n       (2)   nevertheless charged LDs even though the crane-ship was able to\n             dock on arrival.\n\nSee, e.g., 4:51; 25:61-62, 66-68; 71:98; p.10. Zachry did not argue PHA:\n\n       (1)   promised it would not charge LDs if it suffered no harm at all, but\n\n\n                                           58\n\f      (2)    charged LDs even though it suffered no harm.\n\n      At most Zachry opened the door to evidence the ship was not able to dock\n\non arrival—evidence that did not exist, as the ship was able to dock on arrival. See\n\np.22. There was no misleading impression.\n\n      Moreover, any probative value of PHA’s actual-harms evidence in refuting\n\nany minor misimpression would be substantially outweighed by undue delay and\n\nthe unfair prejudice to Zachry. 1SCR6:1116(A7). The trial court noted direct and\n\ncross-examination of PHA witnesses would be lengthy and could devolve into a\n\nlong battle over the alleged harms, causation, and quantification.         Id.   Plus,\n\nrequiring Zachry to cross-examine without discovery would be highly prejudicial.\n\nId.\n\n      PHA incorrectly contends once evidence is deemed admissible under an\n\nopen-the-door theory, Rule 403 cannot exclude it. But PHA’s case reached no\n\nsuch holding. See PHASupp:55-56 (citing Horizon/CMS Healthcare. v.

PHASupp:61-62. Nothing required\nZachry to object to the Charge—which broke out fees by theory to avoid any need for retrial if\nZachry was incorrect—to preserve its argument that Zachry prevails if it wins any breach-of-\ncontract theory.\n\n        But Zachry did object. 71:72(A41) (“Attorneys’ fees should not be submitted at all….”).\nAs here, it argued, “regardless of what happens on the remaining breach-of-contract theories,\nZachry will have a net recovery on its breach-of-contract claim, and as a matter of law, [PHA]\ncannot be the prevailing party.” Id.\n\n                                              66\n\fjudgment in its favor, “regardless of the amount of damages,” “courts have\n\nconcluded that party prevailed on the main issue.” Flagship, 117 S.W.3d at 564.\n\n“Main-issue” analysis applies (if at all) in cases—like those cited by PHA—where\n\nthe Court must determine who prevails when neither party obtains relief.

Zachry’s recovery on its pass-through claim should be affirmed.\n      On January 1, 2008, Zachry reorganized. PX529; 47:123-29. Under the\n\nnew structure, Zachry subcontracted with a new Zachry entity, “the Sub,” to finish\n\nthe wharf. Id.; 47:129-31; PX643(A37); PX642(A38). The Sub employed the\n\nsame people that worked on the project pre-reorganization.       47:129.   Going\n\nforward, the Sub incurred the costs from PHA’s breach. PX642(A38);\n\nPX643(A37); 47:132-34. Zachry must reimburse the Sub for those costs, including\n\nany recovery in this case. Id.\n\n      A.     Zachry asserts a valid pass-through claim.\n      PHA contends Zachry cannot assert a pass-through claim because it hired\n\nthe Sub after PHA’s breach, and thus “PHA’s…breach…did not cause Zachry to\n\nbreach the subcontract.” PHASupp:65. But nothing in the seminal case approving\n\npass-through agreements requires a breach by Zachry. See Interstate Contracting\n\n\n                                       67\n\fCorp. v. City of Dallas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894515\"><a href=\"/opinion/894515/interstate-contracting-v-city-of-dallas/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619-20 (Tex. 2004) (outlining\n\n“requirements”).    Interstate requires only that Zachry “remain liable to the\n\nsubcontractor for damages sustained by the subcontractor.” Id. at 619.\n\n      Interstate also recognizes a general contractor’s decision to hire a sub to\n\nperform work necessitated by the owner’s breach does not preclude the contractor\n\nfrom recovering the cost for the sub. Id. at 611. “Otherwise, the owner could\n\nreceive a windfall because the subcontractor lacked privity with the owner and the\n\ncontractor lacked standing to sue the owner for damages suffered by the\n\nsubcontractor.” Id. at 615-16.\n\n      Here, Zachry established its continuing liability to the Sub for the costs the\n\njury assessed. In the Management Services Agreement (“MSA”), Zachry promised\n\n(1) “to pay to [the Sub] the Reimbursable Costs” it incurred while performing\n\nServices for Zachry, and (2) to pay to the Sub any payments it received from the\n\nowner.    PX643.0004, ¶3.1(A37).        In the Pass-Through Agreement, Zachry\n\n“agree[d]...it is liable to [the Sub], to present the ZCC Claims and remit any\n\nrecovery from the Port of Houston to [the Sub], in accordance with the terms of\n\nthis Agreement.” PX642, ¶1.1(A38). Testimony confirmed Zachry’s continuing\n\nliability to the Sub. 47:127, 130-34.\n\n      The burden therefore shifted to PHA to negate this continuing liability: “If\n\nthe owner disputes that this requirement [of continuing liability] has been met, it\n\n\n                                         68\n\fbears the burden of proving, as an affirmative defense, that the pass-through\n\narrangement negates the contractor's responsibility for the costs incurred by the\n\nsubcontractor.” 135 S.W.3d at 619-20 (“The owner disproves…contractor’s\n\ncontinuing liability only if it can show… contractor is not obligated to remit any\n\nrecovery to…subcontractor.”).\n\n      PHA asserts Zachry might not remain liable to the Sub. PHA speculates—\n\nincorrectly—that owners on other MSA contracts might have paid Zachry more\n\nthan the Reimbursable Costs on their contracts, and that any such excess payments\n\nlimit Zachry’s liability for Reimbursable Costs for the PHA Contract. PHA’s\n\nargument fails to meet its burden.\n\n      First, PHA misunderstands the MSA. It unambiguously states, “Zachry\n\nagrees to pay to Manager [the Sub] the Reimbursable Costs.”          PX643.0004,\n\n§3.1(A37).    PHA incorrectly reads §3.2 to limit Zachry’s obligation to pay\n\nReimbursable Costs when Contract Payments exceed Reimbursable Costs. To the\n\ncontrary, it unambiguously provides the parties shall divide “such excess amounts”\n\nin “a mutually satisfactory allocation.” Id. at §3.2(A37).   Nothing in the MSA\n\nsuggests that allocation of “such excess amounts” limits Reimbursable Costs\n\nZachry must pay to the Sub on other contracts. Id.(A37).\n\n      Second, even if PHA reads the MSA correctly, PHA proved no other\n\ncontract “windfall” to negate Zachry’s liability for the Sub’s Reimbursable Costs\n\n\n                                       69\n\fon this Contract.\n\n       B.       The Court correctly charged the jury on pass-through.\n       PHA’s charge-error arguments likewise fail. Zachry unambiguously agreed\n\nto pay the Sub Reimbursable Costs, and PHA failed to negate Zachry’s liability to\n\nthe Sub.        Accordingly, the trial court properly granted a directed verdict\n\nrecognizing the pass-through agreement’s validity and Zachry’s right to recover\n\nthe Sub’s damages, and properly declined to charge the jury to include those costs\n\nonly “to the extent” Zachry agreed to reimburse the Sub for them. 71:11-13(A40);\n\nCR59:17365-74. Nor was the Court’s instruction that the jury “should” include in\n\ndamages any Reimbursable Costs an improper comment.\n\n       C.       Waiver of immunity applies to the pass-through claims.\n       Nor does immunity bar pass-through claims.

The Court understands\n\n- that the case involved a plt:a to the jurisdiction. id. at 744. and that the current matter docs not.\n\n   Nevertheless, the court in Sorahern Electric was still squarely tuced with the question of whether\n\n   a pleading of damages that were not c:<prl·ssly contemplated by the contract at issue, but were\n\n   instead,   clear~v   owsidc of the contract, deprived   th~   trial court of j urisdiction as being outside of\n\n   the damages permitted in section 271.153. Jd. The court in Sou/hem Eleclric seems to have\n\n   understood what it was dealing with. and could easily have concluded that the pleading of the\n\n  damages for increased costs to perform the contract. which was unquestionably outside of 1he\n\n   four comers of the contract, id.. ueprivt!d the trial court of jurisdiction. The court did not, and\n\n   instead essentiall y found section 271.153 to be a mcrc limitation on damages (and it was\n\n\n\n\n                                                       2\n                                                                              /\n\f                             •\n  published after the Supreme Court's opinion in Tooke) .

App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.) (both written after Tooke) seem to conclude\n\n  that section 271.153 is not jurisdictional. but merely a limitation on damages.\n\n          In the end, the Court is unwilling to find that the \"balance due and owed\" language in\n\n  271.153   et seq.   requires that the types of damages that a contractor sues for after an alleged\n\n- breach of contract by tht:: owner have to be expressly li sted in the contract. The Co.urt believes\n\n  that despite Defendant Port of Houston Authority's excellent briefing and arguments to the\n\n  contrary, such a finding would likely lead to absurd results. The Court can imagine contracts\n\n  expanding to include hundreds of pages of boilerplate and surplussage, drafted by battalions of\n\n  lawyers (not that the Court    ~as   anything against lawyers). that no one reads just to cover any ·\n\n  possible contingency, and any permutation or derivation of any such contingency. If that were\n\n  so, and if Mr. Nixon's statements in the legislative history really carried the day, then such\n\n  language could have easily been includt:d in section 271.153. It was not.\n\n         The Court believes that it understands and appreciates Defendant Port of Houston\n\n  Authority's position that the limitation on damages contained in Texas Local Gov't Code section\n\n  271 .153 et seq. is part of the limited waiver of sovc:reign immunity and thus those provisions\n\n  should be construed narro,vly. The bottom line is that. whether that position is correct or not, the\n\n  Court docs not find that this issue to be dispositive. The Court's \\'iew is that the answer is in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     3\n\f ..                            •                                                    •\nlanguage of sections 271 .153(a)(l) and (2). That is, the Court tinds that the damages arc direct\n\ndamages and constitute (a) the balance due and owed by the local governmental entity under the\n\ncontract as it may have been amended, including any amount owed as compensation for the\n\nincreased cost to perfonn the work as a direct result of owner-caused delays or accelera~ion; or\n\n(2) the amount owed for change orders or additional work the contractor is directed to pcrfonn\n\nby a local governmental entity in connection with the contract, or both. That is true whether the\n\nsection is interpreted narrowly or broadly. 1\n\n         The Court has considered Zachry Construction Corporation's motions, the Port's Motions\n\nfor JNOV, the parties responses, as well as the parties replies and sur-replies, the record in this\n\nmatter, and the jury verdict, and RENDERS jud~:,rment t{lr Zachry Construction Corporation and\n\nagainst the Port of Houston Authority of Harris County.

Further, the Court has not awarded the $600,000 withheld for\n\ndredging work that the jury refused to award to Plaintiff;\n\n         (2)      lt   is further ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that Zat:hry\n\nConstruction Corporation recover from the Defendant Port of Houston Authority of Harri$\n\nCounty, Texas prejudgment interest on that sum in the amount of $3,451 ,022.40, which is\n\n\n\n1\n  The Coun is also not persuaded that any narrow reading of se~:ti on 271 .153 relates to the continued existence of\ncommon law exceptions to the no-damages-for-dday clause in the Wharf :md Dredging Contract. This Court has\nrepeatedly held in this cose that thoSI! provisions are part ofTt'xas law.

Following a three-month\njury trial, the trial court entered a final judgment, awarding Zachry damages in the amount $19,992,697, plus pre- and\npost-judgment interest. The Port appeals the final judgment in eleven issues. Zachry also brings three issue on cross-appeal.\nWe reverse and render.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     I. BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2003, the Port solicited bids to construct a wharf at the Bayport Ship Channel. The wharf consisted of five sections, each\napproximately 330 feet in length. Zachry’s bid proposed building the wharf “in the dry” by using a U-shaped, frozen earthen\nwall to seal out water from Galveston Bay from the construction site. Zachry proposed to freeze the wall by sinking 100–foot\npipes into the wall and circulating chilled brine through the pipes. Then, Zachry would install drilled shafts into the ground,\npour a concrete deck on top of the drilled shafts and dirt using the ground as the bottom of the concrete form, excavate the\ndirt under the deck, and place revetment to stabilize the slope. After completing the wharf, Zachry would breach the freeze\nwall, flooding the area, and remove the remainder of the freeze wall so that ships would be able to dock at the wharf and\nunload their cargo.\n\nAn advantage of working “in the dry” instead of “in the wet” is that fewer “NOx” emission credits would be consumed. The\nPort accepted Zachry’s bid because of the environmental benefits of using the freeze wall. On June 1, 2004, Zachry entered\ninto the Bayport Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract with the Port for the construction of a 1,660–foot wharf. The Port\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n\n\n\nhad concerns about the possible impact of the frozen soil on adjacent structures but provided in the contract that Zachry\nwould control the means and methods. Zachry hired RKK–SoilFreeze Technologies, which, in turn, hired Dan Mageau of\nGeoEngineers, a geotechnical engineer, to design the freeze wall.\n\nThe contract also provided a strict timeline. Specifically, Zachry was to complete construction of the wharf by June 1, 2006.\nZachry was also to meet an interim deadline of February 1, 2006—Milestone A—by which a portion of the wharf would be\nsufficiently complete to allow delivery of large ship-to-shore cranes that were to be shipped from China. The contract also\nprovided that Zachry’s sole remedy for any delay on the project was an extension of time.\n\nIn March 2005, the Port decided to extend the original wharf Zachry was constructing by 332 feet. Zachry submitted price\nquotes for the wharf extension on April 13, May 18, and July 11. The Port and Zachry executed Change Order 4 for the wharf\nextension on September 27, 2005. Change Order 4 extended the dates for Milestone A to February 15, 2006, and final\ncompletion to July 15, 2006.\n\nFrom Zachry’s perspective, Change Order 4 incorporated the April 13 proposal as further modified by the May 18 and July\n11 proposals. So, Zachry had Mageau design a frozen cutoff wall (frozen COW), a perpendicular wall to the main freeze\nwall, to split the project into two phases: a west side including Area A, and an east side. Zachry sent that September 9, 2005\nfrozen COW design to the Port for “review,” not “approval.” Zachry believed it had the right to use the frozen cutoff wall and\nto do so with “uninterrupted work process.”\n\n*845 From the Port’s perspective, Zachry’s September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff wall design was subject to a contractual\ntechnical specification that provided the Port with the right to respond. Because the contract specifically provided the Port a\nright to respond with a “revise and resubmit” (R & R), and because the Port had serious concerns about the design, that is\nprecisely what it did. The Port provided its R & R response that (1) noted preliminary indications that the design may have an\nindeterminate effect on up to 14 shafts, (2) directed Zachry either to “present [an] alternative cutoff wall design” or to\n“present the Port of Houston with an alternate means of mitigating risk” to the shafts, and (3) allowed Zachry to use the\nfrozen COW design if the shafts were protected.\n\nUltimately, in late November 2005, Zachry abandoned the frozen COW and switched to an “in the wet” scenario. The Port\nurges the course was Zachry’s voluntary change in recognition that the freeze wall was “killing the schedule.” Zachry urges\nthat it was due to the Port’s rejection of the frozen COW (Zachry’s means and methods) and unwillingness to depart from the\ncontract deadlines.\n\nIn May 2006, the Port notified Zachry that, due to Zachry’s delay, the Port would begin withholding liquidated damages from\npayments on Zachry’s monthly invoices. After withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages, the Port voluntarily stopped\nwithholding liquidated damages.\n\nIn late 2006, Zachry sued the Port for breach of contract, i.e., the R & R response, by failing to comply with Change Order 4\nand section 5.10 of the contract, for the difference between the cost that Zachry would have incurred had it been allowed to\ncomplete the wharf “in the dry,” i.e., using the frozen cutoff wall, and the actual cost Zachry incurred in completing the wharf\n“in the wet,” i.e., without the frozen cutoff wall. Zachry also sued the Port for withholding liquidated damages for delays in\nthe amount of $2.36 million, and for the Port’s withholding of $600,000 as a purported offset for alleged defective dredging\nunder Change Order 1. The Port filed a counterclaim for attorney’s fees under section 3.10 of the contract, which provides\nthat Zachry is liable for the Port’s attorney’s fees if Zachry brings a “claim” against the Port and “does not prevail with\nrespect to such claim.” Over two years after suing the Port, Zachry declared the wharf complete on January 26, 2009.\n\nAfter a three-month trial, the case was submitted to the jury. The jury found that the Port had breached the contract by failing\nto comply with Change Order 4 and section 5.10, and found compensatory damages in the amount of $18,602,697 for the\nPort’s breach of the contract. These damages represented Zachry’s increased costs for switching to working in the “wet.” The\njury found that 58.13% of those damages were for delay or hindrance.\n\nThe jury did not find that the Port failed to comply with the contract by withholding $600,000 from the Port’s payment on the\namounts invoiced by Zachry for defective dredging.\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Thus, the jury needed only to determine whether the Port was entitled to offset; the jury\nfound for the Port on the offset defense in the amount of $970,000 for Zachry’s defective work on the Wharf fenders.\n\nThe jury found reasonable attorney’s fees for the Port with respect to Zachry’s claim relating to Change Order 4 and/or\nsection 5.10: (1) $10,500,000 for trial; (2) *846 $90,000 for appeal to the court of appeals; and (3) $22,500 for appeal to the\nTexas Supreme Court. The jury found reasonable attorney’s fees for the Port as to Zachry’s claim for withholding the $2.36\nmillion as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging: (1) $80,250 for trial; (2) $3,750 for appeal to the court of\nappeals; and (3) $1,250 for appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nIn its final judgment, the trial court awarded Zachry damages in the amount of $19,992,697—$18,602,697 plus $2.36 million\nin liquidated damages, less the $970,000 offset for the defective fenders, pre-judgment interest in the amount of\n$3,451,022.40, post-judgment interest on the total sum award of $23,443,719, and taxable costs. The trial court did not award\nthe $600,000 withheld for defective dredging that the jury refused to award to Zachry.

In Issue 4A, the Port\ncontends that section 5.07’s no-damages-for-delay clause bars Zachry’s R & R damages. Specifically, the Port complains that\nthe trial court erred by applying a common-law, tort-like “exception” to the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause. Section\n5.07—the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause—provides:\n\n             The Contractor shall receive no financial compensation for delay or hindrance of the Work. In no event\n             shall the Port Authority be liable to the Contractor or any Subcontractor or Supplier, any other person\n             or any surety for or any employee or agent of any of them, for any damages arising out of or associated\n             with any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance, including\n             events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM,\n             ARISES OUT OF OR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF\n             CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY. The Contractor’s sole remedy in\n             any such case shall be an extension of time.\n\n*847 Question No. 3 asked the jury: “What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly compensate Zachry for its\ndamages, if any, that resulted from the Port’s failure to comply?” Relevant to this issue, the trial court instructed the jury that\nthe contract’s no-damages-for-delay provision precluded Zachry’s R & R damages for delay or hindrance unless the jury\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Instead, through its instruction in Question No. 3, the trial court\ndetermined, as a matter of law, that the Port could not enforce section 5.07 to preclude delay or hindrance damages resulting\nfrom any action by the Port that constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith, or fraud.\n\nInasmuch as the delay damages constitute 100% of the damages awarded, a threshold question this court must resolve on\nappeal is whether the damage award is tainted because the trial court misinterpreted the contract and engrafted common-law\nexceptions onto the contractual no-damages-for-delay provision.\n\nGenerally, courts of many other jurisdictions give only a “restrained approval” of no-damages-for-delay provisions because\nof their harshness. See Maurice T. Brunner, Annotation, Validity and Constructions of “No Damage Clause” with Respect to\nDelay in Building or Construction Contract, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (1976). Those courts, again generally, construe the\nprovisions strictly against the owner/drafter. Id. It is this strict construction that formed the genesis for common-law\nexceptions to the no-damages-for-delay clause.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Texas Supreme Court has not resolved whether Texas recognizes these exceptions.

See R.F. Ball Constr. Co., 570\nS.W.2d at 77–78. Because the parties dispute the application of our precedent,2 we explore it in depth.\n\n2\n        The Port states that “[t]his Court did not hold in R.F. Ball that Texas recognizes common law ‘exceptions.’ ” On the other hand,\n        citing R.F. Ball, among others, Zachry states that “Texas courts have repeatedly recognized and applied the\n        [no-damages-for-delay] exceptions.”\n\n\n\nIn R.F. Ball, the City of Houston appealed a judgment in favor of its contractor arising from the construction of portions of\nthe Houston Intercontinental Airport. Id. at 76. Ball was scheduled to complete the project on April 30, 1967, but did not do\nso until June 9, 1969. During the project, Ball faced “several hundred ‘Change Items’ and between eight hundred and nine\nhundred ‘Clarifications.’ ” Id. The City paid direct costs associated with these changes, but did not pay indirect or impact\ncosts associated with the changes. Id. The types of indirect costs included disruption to the project and “general hindrance of\nefficient work which inevitably resulted from the changes.” Id.\n\nAfter a two-month trial, the jury awarded substantial damages to Ball and specifically found inter alia that (1) the number of\nchanges was greater than foreseen by the parties; (2) the unforeseen changes caused Ball’s delay; and (3) such delay was not\nforeseen when the parties entered into the contract. Id.\n\nThus, on appeal, this court faced these jury findings and a no-damages-for-delay clause that provided, in pertinent part:\n\n             The Contractor shall receive no compensation for delays or hindrances to the *849 work, except when\n             direct and unavoidable extra cost to the Contractor is caused by the failure of the City to provide\n             information or material, if any, which is to be furnished by the City.... If delay is caused by specific\n             orders given by the Engineers to stop work, or by the performance of extra work, or by the failure of\n             the City to provide material or necessary instructions for carrying on the work, then such delay will\n             entitle the Contractor to an equivalent extension of time ....\n\nId. at 77.\n\n\nAs a starting point, and citing to other jurisdictions, this court acknowledged that “one of the exceptions to the application of\na [no-damages-for-delay] provision is that a delay which was not intended or contemplated by the parties to be within the\npurview of the provision is not governed by it.” Id.

Referring again to other\njurisdictions, we also noted three additional generally recognized exceptions to enforcement of no-damages-for-delay\nclauses.3\n\n3\n        The additional exceptions we mentioned are: (1) delay resulting from fraud, misrepresentation, or other bad faith on the part of one\n        seeking the benefit of the provision; (2) delay that has extended such an unreasonable length of time that the party delayed would\n        have been justified in abandoning the contract; and (3) delay not within the specifically enumerated delays to which the\n        no-damages-for-delay clause applies.

Significantly,\nwe specifically rejected Ball’s line of cases that held that “if the delays or their cause were beyond the contemplation of the\nparties, then the [no-damages-for-delay] clause does not apply.” Id. at 78 n. 2 (“We disagree with such cases since they\npreclude operation of the clause in situations where the character of the delay was unforeseen[,] the precise sort of delays the\nclause is designed to cover.”). Ball obtained specific jury findings that the delay it occasioned fell directly within the\ncommon-law exception upon which it relied. Id. at 77–78. Nonetheless, we determined that, because the\nno-damages-for-delay clause was unambiguous and did not limit its application to foreseen delays, Ball could not establish a\nright to compensation for the indirect costs of the delay.

Id. Nevertheless, relying explicitly on the “instructive” language of the United States\nSupreme Court, we explained:\n\n            “Men who take $1,000,000 contracts for government buildings are neither unsophisticated nor\n            careless. Inexperience and inattention are more likely to be found in other parties to such contracts than\n            the contractors, and the presumption is obvious and strong that the men signing such a contract as we\n            have here protected themselves against such delays as are complained of by the higher price exacted\n            for the work.”\n\nId.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1920)).\n\nThus, in R.F. Ball, we noted that the common-law exceptions to no-damages-for-delay provisions are “generally recognized”\nand, further, we analyzed one of the exceptions—that the “delay which was not intended or contemplated by the parties to be\nwithin the purview of the provision.” *850 Id. at 77. However, we did not apply the exception because the contractor “ha[d]\nnot established that the [no-damages-for-delay] clause was not intended to apply to unforeseen delays and hindrances and that\nit was only intended to apply to foreseeable ones.” Id. at 78.\n\nHere, the exceptions applied by the trial court addressed: “delay or hindrance that was the result of the Port’s actions, if any,\nthat constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.” Under R.F. Ball, then, we must\ndetermine whether Zachry established that the no-damages-for-delay clause at issue was not intended to apply to delay or\nhindrance that was the result of the Port’s actions. The plain language of the pertinent portion of the provision is as follows:\n“arising out of or associated with any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance\nincluding events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM, ARISES OUT OF\nOR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF\nTHE PORT AUTHORITY.” Thus, the parties’ agreement states there are no damages for delay “regardless of the source.”\n\nFurther, though the parties had already stated that the source of the delay was immaterial, they gave emphasis to their intent\nthat delay due even in part to conduct by the Port was something they were specifically contemplating. And, as if specific\nmention might be insufficient, the parties typed the matters regarding conduct by the Port in all capital letters, which set it\napart from the remainder of the paragraph. Finally, to give utmost emphasis, the parties described three categories of fault:\n(1) negligence, (2) breach of contract; or (3) other fault.\n[4]\n   We know that the delay or hindrance damages were caused, at least in part, by breach of contract. By its response to\nQuestion Nos. 1 and 2, the jury determined that the Port breached the contract—both Change Order 4 and section 5.10 of the\ncontract. The jury answered Question No. 3 by finding damages “that resulted from” the breach in the amount of\n$18,602,697. By the parties’ agreement regarding Question No. 4, the evidence conclusively established that 100% of those\ndamages are delay or hindrance damages. Thus, 100% of the delay or hindrance suffered by Zachry resulted from the conduct\nof the Port, that is, breach of contract. In accord with R.F. Ball, we conclude that Zachry has failed to establish that the\nno-damages-for-delay clause was not intended to apply to the Port’s breach of contract.\n\nThe jury was not asked to make a specific finding on whether the Port’s conduct “constituted arbitrary and capricious\nconduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.” However, we conclude that even a specific jury finding would not\ninterfere with the application of the no-damages-for-delay clause in this case. By the parties’ emphasis on “other fault” to the\nspecific exclusion of “negligence,” the parties have communicated their intent that Port conduct that rises above mere\nnegligence or is a departure from the standard of care does not preclude enforcement of the no-damages-for-delay clause.\nAgain, in keeping with R.F. Ball, we conclude that Zachry has failed to establish that the no-damages-for-delay clause was\nnot intended to apply to Port conduct including, arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith, or fraud.\n\nAs harsh as this result seems, Texas law respects the objective intent of the parties where contract provisions show that the\nparties contemplated delay when entering *851 into the contract.

(emphasis in original).\n\nZachry argues that if we do not apply the common-law exceptions to the contract’s no-damages-for-delay clause, then the\ncontract would be unbreachable and illusory. Zachry asserts, for example, that the Port could force Zachry to switch its\nmeans and methods and thereby cause serious delays in Zachry’s performance. Zachry also avers that the Port could create a\ndelay that lasts in perpetuity and then grant Zachry an extension of time that lasts in perpetuity, thereby breaching the\ncontract while leaving Zachry with no remedy. However, the parties are free to negotiate and agree upon the conditions under\nwhich (1) the contractor will recover damages for delay, and (2) another remedy is available to the contractor for any such\ndelay. In June 2004, Zachry unambiguously agreed that it would perform the contract without the benefit of delay damages,\neven if the delay was caused by the Port’s breach of contract, negligence, or other fault. Zachry faced significant delays;\ndelays it alleged—and the jury agreed—were caused by the Port’s breach of contract. In November 2005, Zachry *852\nproceeded with construction “in the wet,” knowing the contract afforded no damages for delay. We cannot rewrite the\nprovision without depriving the Port of the benefit of the bargain the parties reached in June 2004.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the no-damages-for-delay clause in the parties’ contract precludes Zachry’s recovery of damages\nfor its R & R claim. We sustain Issue 4A.4\n\n4\n              In Issue 4B, the Port further asserts that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding of any\n              common law “exceptions” included in the court’s charge that could be recognized under Texas law. However, we need not address\n              those arguments in light of our disposition of Issue 4A.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             B. Liquidated Damages\n\nBy Issue 9A, the Port also seeks reversal of the judgment for liquidated damages. The Port began withholding liquidated\ndamages of $20,000 per day for Zachry’s failure to meet Milestone A and the Wharf’s final completion pursuant to sections\n5.05 and 5.06 of the contract.5 The trial court determined that the Port’s withholding liquidated damages constituted a failure\nto comply with the contract. The Port does not appeal that ruling. Rather, the Port argues that any failure to comply with the\ncontract by withholding liquidated damages was excused because Zachry released such claims as a matter of law.\n\n5\n              Section 5.05 is entitled “Time of Completion and Liquidated Damages,” while section 5.06 is entitled “Actual Damages in Lieu of\n              Liquidated Damages.” The Port does not appear to complain about the trial court’s invalidation of sections 5.05 and 5.06.

In its October 5, 2009 order, the trial court held that section 5.06—the\n       liquidated damages provision—is an unenforceable penalty because it does not make clear that the liquidated damages are in lieu\n       of other damages.\n\n\n\nThe trial court charged the jury that the Port had failed to comply with the contract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated\ndamages. The trial court also charged the jury in Question No. 12 that the failure to comply would be excused to the extent of\nany dollar amounts as to which Zachry had released its claim for withholding liquidated damages.6 Specifically, the trial court\ninstructed the jury to determine “the meaning” of the “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction\nCorporation” pertaining to Payment Estimate Nos. 21–31 in the context of whether the “[f]ailure to comply by the Port is\nexcused” by the doctrine of release. The jury answered “No.” Thus, in order to prevail here, the Port must conclusively\nestablish that Zachry released its claim for sums withheld as liquidated damages.\n\n6\n       The trial court instructed the jury in Question No. 12 regarding excuse as to release:\n            You may also find excuse if you find, by a preponderance of the evidence [,] that Zachry released its claim for the failure to\n            comply.\n         The court also instructed the jury in Question No. 12 regarding excuse as to offset and/or withholding regarding the fenders. The\n         jury’s finding that the Port is excused for the withholding to the extent of $970,000 for the fenders is addressed in Zachry’s\n         cross-appeal.\n\n\n\nSection 6 of the contract governs the parties’ rights and responsibilities regarding payments on the agreement. Section 6.01\nprovides the Contractor’s obligation to create a “Schedule of Costs,” which includes the unit-price basis for all of the various\nitems of work that “shall be the basis for the preparation of and submission of monthly estimates.”\n\n*853 The parties’ payment exhibits confirm this procedure for payment. Zachry submitted its monthly invoice package,\nwhich included a “Payment Estimate—Contract Performance.” Each of Zachry’s Payment Estimate forms identified items of\nwork completed during the period; represented the percentage of the unit that was complete; and requested payment for the\nwork completed that month. By item 12, each Payment Estimate form was “presented for payment” by a representative of\nZachry. By item 13, the construction manager verified the completion status claimed for the period at issue and approved the\nrequest for payment. Item 14 set out categories of deductions—A through N—for items such as prior payments, contractual\nretainage, and “other deductions.” Items 14(C) and 14(M) are “previous liquidated damages” and “liquidated damages this\nperiod.”\n\nOn May 10, 2006, the Port faxed a letter to Zachry stating that the Port was (1) “process[ing] [Zachry’s] March 2006 ...\ninvoice” and (2) deducting, from payment on that invoice, “[l]iquidated damages total[ing] $820,000, based on 41 calendar\ndays from February 16 through March 28, 2006 at $20,000 per calendar day.” Zachry’s March 2006 invoice corresponded to\nZachry’s Payment Estimate No. 23. By that Payment Estimate, Zachry sought a total payment of $1,885,807.26. The Port\nwithheld $820,000 in liquidated damages from payment on Zachry’s Payment Estimate No. 23.\n\nNevertheless, on May 17, 2006, Zachry signed an Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction Corporation\nas follows:\n\n            ZCC hereby acknowledges and certifies that Port of Houston Authority (PHA) has made partial\n            payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Twenty-three (23) and that it has no\n            further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs\n            in Payment Number Twenty-three (23).\n\nFor the period February/March, 2006 through November, 2006, the Port withheld a total of $2.205 million in liquidated\ndamages. In connection with each of these Payment Estimate–Contract Performance forms, Zachry executed an “Affidavit\nand Partial Release of Lien for Zachry Construction Corporation.” The chart that follows depicts the Payment Estimate\nnumber, the period covered, the total liquidated damages withheld, and the date of the Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien:\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Therefore, according to the Port,\nany failure to comply with the contract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages is excused to the extent of $2.205\nmillion.

Its title is “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien for Zachry\n[15] [16]\n\nConstruction Corporation.” It states that Zachry “has no further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed\nand listed on the Schedule of Costs” in the respective Payment Estimate. The body of the document contains neither the word\n“release” nor the word “lien.”9 Yet, the plain language of the *855 sworn statement unambiguously avers that the Port has\npaid “all sums owing” on the Payment Estimate at issue and that Zachry has “no further claims against PHA for the portion\nof the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs” in the Payment Estimate at issue. Zachry’s proposed\ninterpretation of these words to mean “no liens” rather than “no further claims” is not a reasonable interpretation of the\nlanguage.\n\n9\n            That the body of the provision does not contain the word “release” or “lien” or traditional boilerplate associated with releases or\n            liens is not dispositive of our analysis.

Zachry provides and we find no authority for the proposition that an agreement cannot legally release a claim unless it uses\n            the word “release.” In fact, if Zachry were correct, then an agreement to “voluntarily relinquish a right known to me” could not\n            operate as a waiver because the magic word is not uttered. We believe such an artificial approach to construing agreements\n            between parties finds no support in Texas law and would be contrary to the primary purpose of contract interpretation-determining\n            the parties’ intent.\n\n\n\nThe parties also rely on surrounding circumstances to construe the release.

This litigation is styled Cause No.2006–72970, Zachry\n     Construction Corporation v. the Port of Houston Authority, pending in the 151st Judicial District Court of Harris County,\n     Texas (the “Lawsuit”). Each of Zachry Construction Corporation and the Port of Houston Authority agrees that Zachry\n     Construction Corporation’s execution of this Lien Release for pay Estimate No. [ ] does not in any way release or modify\n     the parties’ rights and obligations under the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract or constitute a release of any claim or\n     claims that the parties may present in the Lawsuit with respect to Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.\n\nThus, the first form included, in addition to the release language at issue here, broad, general release language that purported\nto cover “all causes of action” including legal or equitable, common-law or statutory claims arising in contract, tort, or\nproperty rights. The parties deleted this general release language from the second version of the release at issue here. And,\nwhen litigation ensued, the parties revised the form again to reinsert general release language, but to specifically except the\nclaims in this suit. Still, the third version contained the release language at issue here. Thus, the “deletion” gives no support\nto Zachry’s argument that the release was transformed into a mere release of lien.10\n\n10\n          Zachry stresses that “the second version deleted the general release language.” (emphasis in original).

And while we have looked at a prior policy in deciding between\n         reasonable constructions of a current one, we have never done so in lieu of construing the current one at all.”)\n\n\n\nFurther, the parties point to section 6.07 of the contract to guide the interpretation of the release. Section 6.07 required Zachry\nto release any further “claim[s] for payment” as to Zachry’s prior invoice/Payment Estimate.11 It further provides, in *857\npertinent part, that such waivers and releases of liens shall provide, “at a minimum, that all amounts due and payable to the\nContractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier, as of the date of such invoice ... have been paid in full.” Zachry relies\non the “to the extent set out in the preceding sentence” language as an indication that the contract did not require it to release\na claim that payment had not been made in full; just a release of any lien arising out of the failure to do so. The Port urges\nthat the subject provision unambiguously released any further claim for payment for the work accomplished and billed on the\nrelevant payment estimate and, thus, released any claim that there was no payment in full by virtue of a liquidated damages\noffset. Zachry argues that the subject provision unambiguously released nothing more than claims for payment to assure an\neffective release of liens. Once the parties eliminated the “general release language,” Zachry insists it no longer released its\nbreach of contract claim with each payment.\n\n11\n         Section 6.07 of the contract states, in pertinent part:\n              As a condition precedent to the obligation of the Port Authority to make payment on any invoice, the Contractor shall supply\n              the Port Authority with waivers and releases of liens (including without limitation all mechanics’ and materialmens’ liens and\n              any other type of security interest), which waivers and releases shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the Contractor\n              and each Subcontractor and Supplier expecting payment from [the] Contractor in respect of such invoice in order to assure an\n              effective release of such liens to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. The waivers and releases of liens shall\n              provide, at a minimum, that all amounts due and payable to the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier, as of\n              the date of such invoice and as of the date of the last payment received by the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and\n              Supplier have been paid in full and that the Contractor and each such Subcontractor and Supplier waives, releases and\n              relinquishes any lien (including without limitation any mechanic’s or materialman’s lien), security interest and claim for\n              payment to the extent set out the preceding sentence.\n\n\n[17]\n    Zachry’s construction of version two of the release is inconsistent with the surrounding circumstances. First, as\nmentioned, the only reference to “lien” is the heading of the affidavit. It cannot be limiting language, however, because it is\nthe same heading for each of the three versions, including the first version that Zachry admits operated as a broad release of\nclaims.12 Second, section 6.07 does not provide a limiting circumstance. Although section 6.07 may not require Zachry to\nrelease anything more than liens arising from failure to make payment, even Zachry acknowledges that it released far more in\nconnection with version one because version one mentions claims, including liens. Similarly, version two mentions claims,\nnot liens, for the portion of the Work completed and listed. As such, any limitation of section 6.07 is not a limitation on our\nconstruction of the release provision.\n\n12\n         A broad, general release releases every potential cause of action pertaining to the subject matter. See Keck, Mahin & Cate, 20\n         S.W.3d at 698.\n\n\n\nWe conclude the provision is subject to one reasonable interpretation, that is: the provision at issue (version two) releases any\nfurther claim for payment for work accomplished and billed by the relevant payment estimate, which also operates to release\nany lien for that same work because payment is made in full. Because the general release language is omitted, the provision\ndoes not release:\n\n       • claims arising in tort;\n\n       • claims to adjudicate property rights;\n\n       • claims for any and all causes of action, claims, demand, debts, liabilities, *858 expenses, or costs of any kind and\n       every character and nature whatsoever; or\n\n\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n\n\n\n       • all claims for breach of contract.\n\nBut, even without the general release language, the specific release language of version two releases claims for breach of\ncontract predicated upon a failure to make payment for work accomplished, billed, and paid—in whole or in part—on a\nparticular payment estimate.\n\nOur dissenting colleague concludes that the Port has failed to establish release as a matter of law because the documents at\nissue are, at a minimum, ambiguous. Meticulously comparing the release documents to the Payment Estimates at issue, the\ndissent urges that the release leaves open the question of what document is referenced in each release. Such asserted\nambiguity is not one argued by Zachry, however. Zachry does not urge that the releases do not match the payment estimates.\nZachry does not urge that the term Payment Estimate is ambiguous in its reference to Zachry’s payment estimates rather than\nthe Port’s. Zachry does not urge that the absence of evidence identifying a payment release seeking payment in the same\nquantity released defeats the release. To the contrary, Zachry urges that the release is a release to the full extent of the\npayment estimates; it simply urges that the release is a full release of lien, rather than a full release of payment.\n[18]\n     Moreover, there is no ambiguity in “what exactly has been released” as the dissent suggests. The language of the release\ngoes beyond saying Zachry has no further claims against PHA. The release says “[Zachry] has no further claims against PHA\nfor the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Number –––.” (emphasis added).\nIt is undisputed on this record that the Port had already withheld all of the liquidated damages that it ever did withhold by the\ntime Zachry signed the subject release in January 2007. Thus, it released any further claim for the work that had been\ncompleted and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate 31. Texas law requires identification of the claim to be\nreleased—not quantification.\n\nIn summary, we conclude that, when Zachry signed the “Affidavit and Partial Release of Lien,” stating that the Port “has\nmade partial payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Thirty (30) and that it has no further claims\nagainst PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number 30,”\nZachry unambiguously discharged or released the Port from any further duty or obligation to pay sums billed through\nPayment Estimate No. 29. See Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa., 955 S.W.2d at 127. The “Affidavit and Partial\nRelease of Lien” mentions the claims being released: “claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed\non the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number 30.” See Victoria Bank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at 938. As Payment\nEstimate No. 30 included offsets for liquidated damages in the sum of $2.205 million, Zachry has no further claims for\npayment arising from the work completed and listed on that Payment Estimate.\n\nWe conclude that if the Port failed to comply with the contract by withholding liquidated damages, such failure was excused,\nin part, as a matter of law by Zachry’s release.13 We sustain the Port’s Issue 9A.\n\n13\n         The Port also raises the same release argument in response to Zachry’s issue on cross-appeal regarding the $600,000 withheld for\n         dredging. For the same reason we sustain the Port’s Issue 9A, we overrule Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 1A and B, in which\n         Zachry claims that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the $600,000 withheld for dredging. The jury found in Question\n         No. 9 that the Port did not fail to comply with the contract by withholding $600,000 for dredging. Zachry’s claim to recover the\n         $600,000 for dredging is barred by release as a matter of law, just the same as the $2.205 million in liquidated damages withheld\n         from invoice payments addressed above.\n\n\n\n\n                                           *859 C. $970,000 Offset for Defective Fenders\n\nThe Port claimed a right under section 6.05 of the contract to withhold or offset certain liquidated damage amounts because\nof alleged damages related to Wharf fenders. Question No. 12A asked the jury whether the Port’s failure to comply with the\ncontract by withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages was excused, in whole or part, “by offset and/or withholding”\nfor Zachry’s failure to comply with the contract with respect to fender corrosion.14 The jury found that the Port was entitled to\nwithhold or offset for fender damage in the amount of $970,000. The trial court entered judgment on Zachry’s R & R claim,\nbut offset the $970,000 against Zachry’s damage award.\n                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

He stated that the Port incurred damages in the approximate amount of $978,000 for “recoating”\nrepairs. He also noted that the Port sent a warranty deficiency notice to Zachry on the fenders but Zachry refused to repair\nthem.\n[20]\n    The coating at issue is governed by Technical Specification Section 09950. The jury received evidence that (a) this\nspecification requires Zachry to “apply 2–3 mils of the specified epoxy” coating; and (b) “[t]hickness tests conducted on the\nupper portion of the fenders ranged from 18 to 26 mils including the seal coat.” From this evidence, the jury was entitled to\ninfer that Zachry applied coating well above the 2–3 mils level specified by the contract. Thus, the evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding that Zachry failed to comply with the contract and, specifically, Technical\nSpecification Section 09950.\n[21]\n    The jury also heard evidence that the purpose of the above technical specification on coating is “to obtain full continuity\nof the epoxy and total sealing of porosity.” The fenders were to be sealed because a portion of each fender is installed under\nwater. By his report,15 admitted without objection, Stephen Pinney, an engineer hired by the Port to inspect the fenders,\nindicated that his personal inspection revealed that the three-foot portion of the fenders submerged “failed down to the bare\nsteel” but that the portion of the fenders “above the splash zone” remained intact.

Zachry urges that this testimony is legally insufficient16 because at no point does Vincent or any other witness\nprovide an opinion that $970,000 is the “reasonable and necessary” cost to repair the fenders. The Port counters that the cost\nto repair the fenders need not be “reasonable and necessary” where, as here, the contract itself does not require that the loss\nbe “reasonable and necessary.”\n\n16\n       Zachry also argues that, even if the damages evidence is sufficient, the court should reverse and remand for a new trial, as the trial\n       court failed to instruct the jury that it could only award “reasonable and necessary” damages. We address these points together.\n\n\n\n*861 We agree with the Port and conclude that the trial court did not err with regard to the jury charge.

Attorney’s Fees\n\nIn Issue 11, the Port argues that it is entitled to the attorney’s fees found by the jury for the R & R and withholding claims\nbecause the Port is entitled to judgment on those claims.\n\nZachry brought multiple claims or theories of the Port’s breach of the contract: the R & R claim, i.e., failure to comply with\nChange Order 4 and section 5.10 of the contract, and claims for withholding $2.36 million in liquidated damages and\n$600,000 for dredging. The jury determined that a “reasonable fee for necessary services of the Port’s attorneys” on\n“Zachry’s Claim Relating to Change Order 4 and/or § 5.10 of the Contract” is $10,500,000 for trial; $90,000 for an appeal to\nthe court of appeals; and $22,500 for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court. The jury determined that a reasonable fee for\n“Zachry’s Claim for Withholding the $2.36 million as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging” is $80,250 for\ntrial; $3,750 for an appeal to the court of appeals; and $1,250.00 for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.\n\nSection 3.10 of the contract makes Zachry liable for the Port’s attorney’s fees if Zachry brings “a claim” and “does not\nprevail with respect to such claim.”17 We have determined that Zachry has not prevailed with respect to “Zachry’s Claim\nRelating to Change Order 4 and/or § 5.10 of the Contract.” We also have determined that Zachry has not prevailed with\nrespect to “Zachry’s Claim for Withholding the $2.36 million as liquidated damages and the $600,000 for dredging,” i.e., we\nhave sustained the Port’s Issue 9A that the Port’s withholding liquidated damages was excused by $2.205 million of the\n$2.36 million damages awarded, and we have overruled Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 2 on the Port’s $970,000 offset of the\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Having determined that Zachry did not prevail on the three claims or theories presented\nto the jury, we need not determine whether Zachry brought one or two or three claims.18 We need only determine whether\n*862 the sums awarded by the jury for the Port’s reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees are supported by factually\nsufficient evidence.\n\n17\n       Section 3.10 states:\n            If Contractor brings any claim against the Port Authority and Contractor does not prevail with respect to such claim,\n            Contractor shall be liable for all attorney’s fees incurred by the Port Authority as a result of such claim.\n\n\n\n18\n       If the Port had succeeded on appeal on only the judgment for the R & R claim, Zachry claims that the Port would not be entitled to\n       any attorney’s fees on the R & R claim because Zachry would still have prevailed on its breach of contract claim. That is, Zachry\n       argues that it brought one breach of contract claim, but different theories of breach: R & R damages and withholding damages. The\n       Port contends that Zachry brought multiple claims, entitling the Port to the segregated attorney’s fees on the R & R claim if a\n       take-nothing judgment is rendered on the R & R claim, but not the withholding claims. However, because Zachry has not prevailed\n       on any of its “claims” or “theories,” we need not address these arguments.\n\n\n\nBy Cross–Appeal Issue 3, Zachry contends that in the event that Zachry does not prevail on any theory underlying its\nbreach-of-contract claim, Zachry would still be entitled to a new trial on attorney’s fees. In support of its claim for attorney’s\nfees, the Port offered the testimony of its billing attorney, Karen White, and its designated attorney’s fees expert, Dan\nDowney. Zachry claims that (1) the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of White because she was not designated as\nan attorney’s fees expert; and (2) Downey’s testimony is factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding on the amount of\nthe Port’s attorney’s fees.\n\nWe first address whether the trial court erred in admitting White’s testimony. Prior to White’s testifying, the trial court ruled\nthat she could testify as a fact witness, but not as an expert because she had not been designated as an expert.19 That is, White\nwould not be allowed to testify as the reasonableness of the segregation of the attorney’s fees. Zachry complains here that\nWhite did, in fact, provide expert testimony. The Port urges that Zachry waived any objection to White’s testimony by failing\nto obtain a ruling.\n\n19\n       Specifically, the trial court ordered that White could “testify as a fact witness only and without reference to these billing records,\n       period, the end.... And so no reference to the billing records and no opinions.” In response to Zachry’s counsel’s clarification that\n       White would “only testify as to the methodology by which this segregation and she [will] not be given [sic] any kind of an opinion\n       as to the reasonableness of segregation. That would be Mr. Downey,” the trial court responded, “Right.”\n\n\n[23]\n    During White’s testimony, Zachry objected twice that White’s testimony was drifting into expert opinions. The first\noccurred when White, after describing the document production process, stated “[w]e didn’t feel that they had produced\nevery document to us that they should have....” Zachry “object[ed] at this point” because White was to be “a very limited fact\nwitness, not an expert,” and was being tendered as a witness for the “limited purpose of segregation. That is, to tell us exactly\nhow the segregation of the fees was identified and determined.” The trial court overruled the objection, stating that it would\n“let White testify about these subjects.” White provided further testimony on the document-production process, including the\nhuge volume of documents produced by each side and the process for reviewing those documents. We find the trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion in ruling that document-production testimony was not expert testimony.\n\nThe second objection occurred during White’s response the question: “[W]hat was your role as a billing attorney?” White\nexplained the process of inputting time and then stated that, “as billing attorney, then I review the bills to make sure that\neverything’s properly chargeable to the client, that it’s properly....” Zachry’s counsel objected, again complaining about the\ntestimony in light of the trial court’s expert-opinion ruling. The trial court agreed that when White “talks about whether a\nparticular item was properly billable to the client,” she is offering an *863 opinion. Therefore, the Port agreed to “ask Ms.\nWhite not to add whether something was properly billable to the client.” Thus, the trial court did not make a ruling adverse to\nZachry or otherwise deny Zachry relief.20\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Therefore, we do not address that\n       argument.\n\n\n\nWe now address Zachry’s complaint that the testimony of the Port’s expert, Dan Downy, was not factually sufficient to\nsupport the jury’s findings on attorney’s fees.21 Downey opined that the attorney’s fees incurred by the Port were reasonable\nand necessary, and that the fees were properly segregated. The jury heard about the Port’s process for compiling factual data\non attorneys’ services rendered. Port paralegal Holly Gray searched the computerized records with certain search terms and\ncreated a spreadsheet that included all of the hours and times for any entry that “had any of the terms in it.” Gray provided\nthat spreadsheet to Downey.\n\n21\n       Downey testified that he had been a Harris County trial judge from 1988 to 1994, and had been a lawyer or judge in Texas for\n       about 33 years. Downey further stated that he had not testified previously as an attorney’s fees expert in any cases other than his\n       own and that, as a trial judge, attorney’s fees did not frequently come before him as a contested issue.\n\n\n\nDowney identified the bases for his opinions as to the reasonableness and necessity of the Port’s legal fees. In addition to the\nspreadsheet, Downey reviewed the pleading and discovery index and requested to see particular pleadings and motions “so\n[he] could get a handle on what was involved.” Downey then conducted separate interviews with individual attorneys\ninvolved in the case concerning “what their role was and how they set about performing that task.” Downey “was trying to\nget a handle on how much work is involved in those tasks, to see if it makes sense and matches up with the time that they\nhave logged for those tasks.” Downey interviewed the attorneys more than once. Downey also interviewed the legal\nassistants. The jury saw several exhibits containing Downey’s notes as well as compilations of fees by month and attorney.\n\nZachry’s attorney’s fees expert, William Junell, agreed that the lawsuit between Zachry and the Port amounted to an\n“all-out-war between the parties for ... three years.”22 However, Junell disagreed with Downey’s opinion on the\nreasonableness and necessity of the fees incurred by the Port.\n\n22\n       Junell testified that he had been practicing law for over 38 years and had served as an expert witness on attorney’s fees\n       approximately a dozen times.\n\n\n\n   Both Junell and Downey testified about the factors applicable to an attorney’s fee award.23 The jury heard that the *864\n[24]\n\nPort’s fees were two-and-a-half times more than Zachry’s in October 2008. That “raised red flags in [Junell’s] mind.”\nDowney, however, explained that the primary difference related to the review of documents. Downey was satisfied that the\nwork the Port lawyers performed in reviewing documents “was fair and reasonable and necessary.”\n\n23\n       The factors are (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill required to\n       perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n       employment; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the amount involved and the results\n       obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional\n       relationship with the client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and (8)\n       whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been rendered.\n       Arthur Andersen & Co. v.

He also\nexplained that he had taken out certain aspects of Port fees that he did not consider appropriate.\n\n24\n       Here, the Port urges that Zachry has waived its sufficiency issue because its complaints are “waived challenges to his\n       methodology.” However, Zachry urges a factual sufficiency challenge to fees, not a legal sufficiency challenge. The Port cites no\n       case, and we find none, that holds that failure to challenge a fee expert’s methodology waives a factual sufficiency complaint on\n       appeal.\n\n\n\nUltimately, through a thorough cross-examination of Downey, Zachry made the jury aware of the weaknesses in the Port’s\nattorney’s fee claim: the Port was seeking $15 million in attorney’s fees to defend Zachry’s $30 million claims; the Port had\nfour separate law firms defending it; Downey had not documented what tasks were performed by each attorney; and Downey\nhad not used actual bills to form his opinion even though that is the standard practice for attorney’s fee witnesses, and though\nthey would have provided some verification of the attorneys’ representation of their time spent.\n[26]\n    We conclude that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the fee award in this case, though the evidence would also\nhave supported far less. The most significant concern about this award is the relationship between the fee awarded and the\namount in controversy, particularly when compared to the fees incurred by Zachry. However, this court has previously\ndetermined, albeit on much smaller sums, that a fee award that was two times the amount in controversy was supported by\nlegally and factually sufficient evidence. See Bencon Mgmt. & Gen. Contracting, Inc. v. Boyer, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1633520\"><a href=\"/opinion/1633520/bencon-management-v-boyer-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209–10\n(Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.)

Moreover, the testimony provides sufficient evidence to support this discrepancy. Downey’s and White’s testimony\nillustrated that the majority of the differential occurred in the area of discovery and, specifically, the pursuit and review of\ndocument production. White testified that rather than provide copies of responsive documents to the Port, Zachry asked the\nPort’s attorneys “to come out to the site facility and review documents there.” Thus, two Port attorneys went to an un-air\nconditioned, metal container facility “crammed full of boxes not organized in any manner.” They pulled boxes outside of the\ncontainer, one at a time, “and sat under a tree in May out at the wharf site *865 and reviewed documents searching for things\nthat might be responsive.” While Junell testified about the volume of material reviewed by each side, he spoke of electronic\ndocuments; thus, the jury was free to believe that the method of document production played a role in the number of hours\nthe Port attorneys needed to spend to accomplish the task. We conclude that the evidence is factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding on attorney’s fees.\n\nWe overrule Zachry’s Cross–Appeal Issue 3.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\nTo summarize, we hold that the application of the no-damages-for-delay clause precludes Zachry’s claim for delay or\nhindrance damages on its claim for damages on its R & R claim.\n\nWe further hold that Zachry released, as a matter of law, $2.205 million of its $2.36 million claim for the Port’s withholding\nliquidated damages. We further hold that the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding of the\nPort’s offset of $970,000 for defective fenders. Because the amount of liquidated damages that Zachry released and the\namount of offset the jury found for defective fenders is greater than the $2.36 million that Zachry sought for the Port’s\nwithholding of liquidated damages, we hold that Zachry may not recover on its $2.36 million claim for withholding\nliquidated damages.\n\nWe further hold that the trial court did not err in failing to rule, as a matter of law, that the Port breached the contract by\nwithholding $600,000 for dredging.\n\nWe further hold that the Port is entitled to recover attorney’s fees as found by the jury with respect to Zachry’s R & R claim\nas follows: (1) $10,500,000 for trial, (2) $90,000 for appeal to the court of appeals, and (3) $22,500 for appeal to the Texas\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Application of the Rules to the Documents at Issue\n\n\n1. There is little evidence about the parties’ intent and surrounding circumstances.\n\nThere was very little testimony at trial about the Partial Release of Liens. As to the intent of the parties and the surrounding\ncircumstances, we know only the following: Zachry initially signed a document (“Release Form No. 1”) containing broad\nrelease language in the body of the document. See majority opinion, ante at 855–56. Beginning in September of 2004, Zachry\nrevised the release agreement, leaving only two paragraphs in the body of the document and deleting the broad release\nlanguage (“Release Form No. 2”).1 In 2007, after all of the liquidated damages had already been withheld, the Port rejected an\ninvoice from Zachry with the note, “not accepted at this time without proper release of lien form.” The lawyers for Zachry\nand the Port then got together and came up with an acceptable release form, which once again included the broad release\nlanguage with a carve-out for all claims in this lawsuit (“Release Form No. 3”). See majority opinion, ante at 856. The Port’s\nwitness, Andy Thiess, called the documents “releases” but claimed that he did not know their legal effect. Zachry’s witness\nJean Abiassi claimed that the releases were only releases of liens, as could be seen by the titles of the documents and section\n6.07 of the contract.\n\n1\n       Although I do not think that Release Form No. 2 should be called a release at all, I will refer to it as a release as the majority has\n       done.\n\n\n\n\n2. The releases refer to other documents.\n\nThe jury was asked to decide whether certain numbered documents released the liquidated-damages claim. Each release\nrefers to another document, and to understand what was being released, it was necessary to know the contents of the\nreferenced document. But, the record contains no testimony matching a release and the document to which it refers. The jury\nreceived no charge instructions about how to match a release with the document to which it refers, and the referenced\ndocuments are not attached to the exhibits in *869 the record. The absence of evidence from which to identify the document\nreferenced in a given release is itself a sufficient basis on which to conclude that the Port has failed to prove anything as a\nmatter of law. While the majority contends that Zachry failed to make these arguments, it is the Port’s burden to show exactly\nwhat the “releases” released, in order to prevail on its point of error. The evidence presented at trial does not support the\nPort’s claim as to what was released. To illustrate why this is so, I will address the specific releases at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           a. Release No. 23\n\nI begin by examining the release cited by the majority as an example. Release No. 23 provides as follows:\n\n            ZCC hereby acknowledges and certifies that Port of Houston Authority (PHA) has made partial\n            payment to ZCC on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree (23) and that it has\n            no further claims against PHA for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of\n            Costs in Payment Number Twenty-[T]hree (23).\n\nThis release was signed May 17, 2006.\n\nThe majority contends that the language “it has no further claims against PHA” is a release. See majority opinion, ante at\n855. But what exactly has been released? The agreement identifies such claims only as the claims “for the portion of the\nWork completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three (23).” In order to know\nwhat was released you must refer to the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three.\n\nIn the charge, the trial court instructed the jury, “you must decide the meaning of DX1114.012 and PX884.0159 (re Payment\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                     28\n\fPort of Houston Authority of Harris County v. Zachry Const. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012)\n\n\n\nestimate 23)....” As the majority notes, the Payment estimate and schedule of costs were to be prepared by Zachry under the\ncontract. The referenced numbers in the jury charge refer to different copies of the same document. The documents that\nfollow these exhibit numbers differ from one another. DX1114 is a 14–page document starting with DX1114.001 and ending\nat DX1114.014. It does not include “Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree (23).” PX884 is a 307–page document,\nstarting with PX884.0001 and ending with PX884.0307. It also does not include “Payment Estimate Number Twenty-[T]hree\n(23).” It instead includes three copies of Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Two, and then jumps to Payment Estimate\nNumber Twenty–Four.\n\nThere is one document, PX884.0145, that might be Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three. Although the first page states\n“Estimate 22,” the second page states “Estimate 23.” Without knowing exactly what document is referenced in the release,\nhow could that release be unambiguous?\n\nThat Estimate contains both typed and handwritten notations. There was no testimony as to who prepared the handwritten\nnotations, or when those notations were made, or whether those notations were communicated to Zachry. The typed\ndocument has a stated date of March 25, 2006. At the bottom of the page there is a typed reference to “LIQ. DAMAGES (C +\nM)” and the number $0.00 is typed in. “C” is listed above as “Previous Liquidated Damages” with a “$0.00” notation. “M” is\nlisted as “Liquidated Damages this period” and the typed “$0.00” is crossed out and the number “820,000” has been written\nby hand. The document appears to contain the signature of Andy Thiess for the Port and the handwritten date of April 17,\n2006. At the bottom of the last page of that estimate there is a handwritten notation “-(820,000) Feb. + March LD’s.”\n\n*870 The majority puts together a letter written by the Port dated May 10, 20062 and Release No. 23 to somehow link the\nliquidated-damages deduction with the release. But, the release in question does not mention this letter at all, and the letter\nitself does not refer to Payment Estimate Number Twenty–Three. The notation at the bottom can hardly be considered an\nunambiguous description of the Port’s liquidated-damages claim, especially without any testimony that this was even sent to\nZachry. Again, this can only raise an ambiguity that the jury resolved against the Port.\n\n2\n       While the majority in footnote 10 contends that other versions of the release may violate the parol evidence rule, they somehow\n       consider this letter as affirmative evidence as to what was released.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          b. Release No. 24\n\nRelease No. 24, signed June 7, 2006, suffers from some of the same problems. The jury was told to decide the meaning of\n“DX1115.017 and PX884.0168 (re Payment Estimate 24).” DX1115 does not contain Payment Estimate Number 24. PX884\nappears to contain Payment Estimate 24, but at page 884.0154. That Estimate contains both typed and handwritten notations.\nThere was no testimony as to who prepared the handwritten notations, when those notations were made, or whether those\nnotations were communicated to Zachry. The top of the typed document has a stated date of April 10, 2006. At the bottom of\nthe page there is a typed reference to “LIQ. DAMAGES (C + M)” and the number “$0.00” is typed in. The typed number has\nbeen crossed out and the number 600,0003 is handwritten above it. The “C” line above for previous liquidated damages has\nthe typed amount “$0.00,” but on the “M” line, the typed amount “$0.00” has been crossed out and replaced with the\nhandwritten figure, “820,000.” The document appears to contain the signature of Andy Thiess for the Port and the\nhandwritten date of May 10, 2006.\n\n3\n       This number does not match the majority’s chart.\n\n\n\nAll of the remaining releases suffer from the same problems. For the releases that contained handwritten notations, there was\nno testimony as to who prepared the handwritten notations, when those notations were made, or whether those notations were\ncommunicated to Zachry. Each release listed below was in the jury charge but did not have the appropriate payment estimate\nattached, and there was no testimony that the documents that I am referencing below were in fact the appropriate payment\nestimate.\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

It was prepared December 15, 2006.\nIt apparently was approved by Thiess on January 1, 2007. The first page contains the typed notation “LIQ. DAMAGES (C +\nM) $0.00.” This is not crossed out. The “C” line above contains the typed amount “$0.00,” and it has not been crossed out.\nThe “M” line contains the typed amount “$0.00,” but that has been crossed out and the handwritten number 150,000 inserted.\n\nIt appears that every time Zachry sent its payment estimate, it listed “$0.00” in the blank for liquidated damages. On this\nrecord, we do not know whether the referenced payment estimate that was listed in the release was Zachry’s estimate—with\nzero liquidated damages—or the Port’s estimates with its handwritten notations. On this record, the Port cannot prevail as a\nmatter of law.\n\n*872 If the handwritten notations were made by Port personnel to refer to the liquidated damages in question here, then the\nPort was very inconsistent in its treatment of the liquidated damages. On some documents, the Port approved a listing of\n“$0.00” on Line “C” for “previous liquidated damages,” even though the Port had withheld previous liquidated damages.\nBecause the documents do not conclusively establish that a release occurred, I would not hold that a release occurred as a\nmatter of law.\n\nThe majority’s chart also cannot be supported by the actual releases themselves. Assuming that the handwritten notations\nindicated a liquidated-damages deduction, those handwritten numbers do not match the amounts that the majority believes\nwere the actual deductions from Zachry’s invoices.\n\nFinally, even assuming that the document included a reference to the Port’s handwritten notations, the actual release says it\nhas no further claims with respect to the Schedule of Costs in the Payment Estimate—in other words, that Zachry has no\nfurther claim that the work done cost any more than was listed in its Schedule of Costs for the work done that month. Zachry\ncannot later contend that the work cost more than listed on the Schedule. The release does not say that Zachry is to be bound\nby any summary or deductions made by the Port, or that Zachry agrees that the deductions made by the Port are correct.\nThus, the releases violate the fundamental rule that they must mention the claim to be released—it is simply missing from the\nevidence at trial. Under this evidence, we do not know what amount, if any, was allegedly released. While the majority\ncontends that the release does not have to identify the amount released, how else could the majority conclude that a release of\n$2.205 million occurred as a matter of law?\n\n\n\n3. Section 6.07 of the contract supports a release of liens only.\n\nBoth sides cite to the contract to support their claims. Section 6.07 of the contract states in pertinent part as follows:\n\n             As a condition precedent to the obligation of the Port Authority to make payment on any invoice, the\n             Contractor shall supply the Port Authority with waivers and releases of liens (including without\n             limitation all mechanics’ and materialmens’ liens and any other type of security interest), which\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The second sentence limits the release to the preceding sentence which is clearly\nlimited to liens. Even the majority concedes that this section only required Zachry to release a lien. See majority opinion, ante\nat 857. But then the majority uses that against Zachry when it discusses *873 the title of the release forms, noting that\nRelease Form No. 1 was a broad release yet was titled “Partial Release of Lien.” Section 6.07 shows the parties’ intent to\nrelease liens in connection with this Release Form No. 2.\n\n\n\n4. The titles and deletions in the various forms show a limited release.\n\nThe different forms of the release show an intent by Zachry to provide a very limited release. The deletion of the broad-form\nrelease language that was present in Release Form No. 1 shows Zachry’s intent to limit its release. The fact that the Port was\nultimately unhappy with Release Form No. 2 indicates that the Port knew that this release did not provide them any\nprotection at all. See Hous. Exploration Co., 352 S.W.3d at 470–71 (deletions in a contract can be considered in its\nconstruction). While not controlling, a document’s title also can create ambiguity. See Lone Star Cement Corp., 467 S.W.2d\nat 404–05. Here, however, the titles of the documents match up with the contract provision calling only for a release of lien.\n\n\n\n5. This release violates the general rules of construction for a release.\n\nUnder general rules of contract construction, this release is, at most, ambiguous. But when the specific rules of construction\nconcerning releases are incorporated into the analysis, the release fails. To effectively release a claim in Texas, the releasing\ninstrument must mention the claim to be released. See Victoria Bank, 811 S.W.2d at 938. The releases here do not do this.\nReleases must be construed narrowly, see id., yet here, the majority expands the releases’ meaning. And unlike typical\nreleases, the releases in this case do not use language that the parties “release, discharge, [and] relinquish” their claims. Cf.\nDerr Constr. Co., 846 S.W.2d at 859 (“Release language is generally ‘release, discharge, relinquish.’ ”); MG Bldg. Materials,\nLtd. v.

See also Green Int’l, 951 S.W.2d at 387 (contract language that “Contractor shall not be liable to the Subcontractor\nfor delay to Subcontractor’s work by the act, neglect or default of Owner” is not a release because it neither extinguishes a\nclaim nor establishes an absolute bar to any right of action on the released matter).\n\nFor all of these reasons I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion as to the release of the liquidated damages claim.\n\nEnd of Document                                                     © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

A contractor may agree to excuse the owner from liability for delay damages, even when the\nowner is at fault. The contractor thereby assumes the risk of delay from, say, an owner’s change of plans, even if the owner is\nnegligent. But can a no-damages-for-delay provision shield the owner from liability for deliberately and wrongfully\ninterfering with the contractor’s work? Before this case, a majority of American jurisdictions—including Texas courts of\nappeals, courts in all but one jurisdiction to consider the issue, and five state legislatures—had answered no. We agree with\nthis overwhelming view and also conclude that the answer is the same if the owner is a local governmental entity for which\nimmunity from suit is waived by the Local Government Contract Claims Act.1\n\n1\n       TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODEE §§ 271.151–.160.\n\n\n\nContractors are usually paid as work progresses and, in exchange for payment, must waive liens and claims related to the\nwork paid for. But does such a general waiver release a claim the contractor has already asserted? Not, we think, unless the\nclaim is specifically mentioned or the intent to do so is clear.\n\nOur conclusions require us to reverse the judgment of the court of appeals2 and remand the case to that court for further\nproceedings.\n\n2\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   I3\n3\n       The evidence in this case was hotly disputed at almost every turn.

The wharf would be a concrete deck supported by piers, extending out\nover the water. It would be used for loading and unloading ships carrying containerized goods and would be long\nenough—1,660 feet—for two ships to dock stern to bow. It would be built in five sections, each 135 feet wide and 332 feet\nlong. The channel was to be dredged to a *102 depth of 40 feet beneath the wharf and surrounding area, and revetment placed\nalong the shore beneath the wharf to prevent erosion. The total cost was $62,485,733.\n\nThe contract made Zachry an independent contractor in sole charge of choosing the manner in which the work would be\nconducted. Specifically, Section 5.10 of the contract provided:\n\n            The Port Authority shall not have the right to control the manner in which or prescribe the method by\n            which the Contractor [Zachry] performs the Work. As an independent Contractor, the Contractor shall\n            be solely responsible for supervision of and performance of the Work and shall prosecute the Work at\n            such time and seasons, in such order or precedence, and in such manner, using such methods as\n            Contractor shall choose....\n\nThe provision benefitted the Port, insulating it from the liability to which it would be exposed were it exercising control over\nZachry’s work.4 Still, the Port was fully engaged in reviewing Zachry’s plans and overseeing construction.\n\n4\n       See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Moritz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895009\"><a href=\"/opinion/895009/general-elec-co-v-moritz/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 214 (Tex.2008) (“Generally, an owner or occupier does not owe a duty to\n       ensure that independent contractors perform their work in a safe manner. But one who retains a right to control the contractor’s\n       work may be held liable for negligence in exercising that right.”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\nZachry’s plan was innovative. It would use soil dredged from the channel to construct an 8–foot–wide earthen berm starting\nfrom the shore at either end of the worksite, extending out toward the center of the channel, then running parallel to the shore,\nforming a long, flat U-shaped wall in the channel around the construction area. Zachry would install a refrigerated pipe\nsystem in the wall and down into the channel floor that would carry supercooled brine, freezing the wall to make it\nimpenetrable to the water in the channel. Zachry would then remove the water from the area between the wall and the shore.\nIn this way, Zachry could work “in the dry”, using bulldozers and other land equipment for the excavation and revetment\nwork. Another advantage to this freeze-wall approach was that it would lower diesel emissions and require fewer nitrous\noxide credits under environmental laws, giving the Port more flexibility in other construction projects. Zachry believed this\napproach would make the work less expensive and allow it to be completed more quickly.\n\nAnd time was of the essence to the Port. Work began in June 2004 and was to be completed in two years. But two sections of\nthe wharf had to be completed within 20 months—by February 2006—so that a ship from China could dock, delivering\ncranes to be used on the wharf. Zachry agreed to pay $20,000 per day as liquidated damages for missing the deadlines.\n\nNine months into the project, the Port realized that it would need two 1,000–foot berths to accommodate the ships it\nultimately expected to service. A sixth 332–foot section would have to be added to the wharf. As a practical matter, only\nZachry could perform the additional work, and Zachry and the Port began discussions on a change order. To complete the\ntwo sections of the wharf needed by February 2006, and to continue to work “in the dry”, Zachry proposed to build another\nfreeze-wall—a cutoff wall—though the middle of the project, perpendicular to the shoreline out to the existing wall, splitting\nthe project into two parts. Zachry would finish the west end where the ship from China would dock, remove the wall\nbarricading water from that area, then continue working on the east end “in the dry”.\n\n*103 The Port had reservations about this plan. Near the shore, the cutoff wall would have to be built through the area where\npiers had already been driven into the channel floor. The Port’s engineers were concerned that freezing the ground near the\npiers might destabilize them, weakening the wharf and making it unsafe. But the Port was also concerned that if it rejected\nZachry’s plan, Zachry might simply refuse to undertake the addition of a sixth section. So the Port did not raise its concerns\nwith Zachry. Zachry, for its part, had already identified the issue, but its own engineers had concluded that any piers that\nmight be affected could be insulated from the frozen ground. Change Order 4, using Zachry’s approach to add a sixth section\nof the wharf at a cost of $12,962,800, was finalized September 27, 2005.\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

The practical effect of the\nPort’s order was to refuse to allow construction of the cutoff wall. Zachry protested that, under Section 5.10 of the contract,\nthe Port had no right to determine the method and manner of the work, but the Port would not budge. Zachry’s only option\nwas to finish the westmost sections in time for the ship from China to dock, then remove the wall altogether and continue to\nwork “in the wet”, which would delay completion of the project and increase its cost.\n\nIn negotiating Change Order 4, the Port had promised not to impose liquidated damages for delay as long as the ship from\nChina could dock when it arrived, though the Port had refused to put its promise in writing. Nevertheless, after the ship\nsuccessfully docked, the Port began withholding liquidated damages from Zachry’s payments. Eventually the Port desisted,\nbut not until it had withheld $2.36 million. Zachry completed the project in January 2009, more than two-and-one-half years\nafter the contract deadline.\n\nIn November 2006, several weeks after the Port refused to allow construction of the cutoff wall, Zachry sued. Zachry\neventually claimed some $30 million in damages from delays caused by the Port. The Port countered that Section 5.07 of the\ncontract precluded delay damages. That provision states:\n\n            [Zachry] shall receive no financial compensation for delay or hindrance to the Work. In no event shall\n            the Port Authority be liable to [Zachry] or any Subcontractor or Supplier, any other person or any\n            surety for or any employee or agent of any of them, for any damages arising out of or associated with\n            any delay or hindrance to the Work, regardless of the source of the delay or hindrance, including\n            events of Force Majeure, AND EVEN IF SUCH DELAY OR HINDRANCE RESULTS FROM,\n            ARISES OUT OF OR IS DUE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO THE NEGLIGENCE, BREACH OF\n            CONTRACT OR OTHER FAULT OF THE PORT AUTHORITY. [Zachry’s] sole remedy in any such\n            case shall be an extension of time.\n\nZachry argued, and the trial court ultimately agreed, that such a no-delay-damages provision could not be enforced if the\nPort’s intentional misconduct caused the delay.\n\nZachry also sought recovery of the $2.36 million in delay damages withheld by the Port. The trial court held that the\ncontract’s liquidated damages provisions were invalid, and the Port has not challenged that ruling on appeal. But the Port\nresponded that Zachry’s claim to the liquidated damages was precluded by the releases it executed to obtain the periodic\npayments from which liquidated damages were withheld. The releases shared language stating:\n\n            *104 [Zachry] hereby acknowledges and certifies that [the Port] has made partial payment to [Zachry]\n            on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number [–––] and that it has no further claims against [the\n            Port] for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs in Payment Estimate\n            Number [–––].5 The trial court concluded that this language did not unambiguously release Zachry’s\n            claim to the liquidated damages withheld and asked the jury to decide what effect it had.\n\n5\n       There are releases in other forms, at least one of which specifically acknowledged, and excluded any effect on, contract claims at\n       issue in pending litigation between the parties. The release for Payment Estimate Number 35 provided that the parties agreed “that\n       Zachry Construction Corporation’s execution of this Lien Release ... does not in any way release or modify the parties’ rights and\n       obligations under the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract or constitute a release of any claim or claims that the parties may\n       present in the Lawsuit with respect to Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.”\n\n\n\nAfter a three-month trial, the jury found that the Port breached the contract by rejecting Zachry’s cutoff wall design, causing\nZachry to incur $18,602,697 in delay damages.6 The jury also found that the delay “was the result of the Port’s ... arbitrary\nand capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.”7 The jury failed to find that Zachry had released its claim\nto the $2.36 million liquidated damages the Port withheld, but found that the Port was entitled to offset $970,000 for\ndefective wharf fenders. The trial court rendered judgment for Zachry on the verdict.\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

[t]he amount\n       owed, if any, for additional work that Zachry was directed to perform by the Port in connection with the Contract.” The jury found\n       that the percentage of damages for hindrance or delay, as opposed to additional work, was 58.13%. The Port and Zachry have since\n       stipulated that 100% of the damages found by the jury were for hindrance or delay.\n\n\n\n7\n       In assessing damages, the jury was instructed as follows:\n            You are instructed that § 5.07 of the Contract precludes Zachry from recovering delay or hindrance damages, if any, unless\n            you find that the delay or hindrance damages, if any, resulted from a delay or hindrance that was the result of the Port’s\n            actions, if any, that constituted arbitrary and capricious conduct, active interference, bad faith and/or fraud.\n            “Arbitrary and capricious” means willful and unreasoning action without due consideration and in disregard of the facts,\n            circumstances, and rights of other parties involved.\n            “Active interference” means affirmative, willful action that unreasonably interferes with the other party’s compliance with the\n            contract. “Active interference” requires more than a simple mistake, error in judgment, lack of total effort, or lack of complete\n            diligence.\n            “Bad faith” is conscious doing of a wrong for a dishonest purpose.\n            “Fraud” occurs when\n               1. a party makes a material misrepresentation,\n               2. the misrepresentation is made with knowledge of its falsity or made recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as\n               a positive assertion,\n               3. the misrepresentation is made with the intention that it should be acted on by the other party, and\n               4. the other party suffers injury as a result of its reliance on the misrepresentation.\n            “Misrepresentation” means a promise of future performance made with an intent, at the time the promise was made, not to\n            perform as promised, and the promise of future performance is that the Port would comply with the terms of Change Order 4.\n\n\n\nBoth the Port and Zachry appealed. The court of appeals held that the no- *105 delay-damages provision of the contract\nbarred Zachry’s recovery of delay damages,8 that Zachry unambiguously released its claims to $2.205 million of the\nliquidated damages withheld,9 and that the Port was entitled to the $970,000 found by the jury for defective wharf fenders.10\nThe court reversed the judgment for Zachry and rendered judgment for the Port, awarding it the $10,697,750 in attorney fees\nfound by the jury.11\n\n8\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850–851 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2012).\n\n\n\n9\n       Id. at 857–858.

The court of appeals concluded that the no-damages-for-delay provision is enforceable\nand thus found it unnecessary to reach the immunity issue.14 That approach was impermissible. Immunity “implicates a\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction over pending claims”,15 and “ ‘[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any\ncause; it may not assume jurisdiction for the purpose of deciding the merits of the case.’ ”16 We must consider first whether\nthe Act waives a local governmental entity’s immunity from suit on a contract claim for delay damages the contract does not\ncall for.\n\n13\n          Tex.

One is whether the Act’s limitations on recovery help define and restrict the scope of the waiver of\nimmunity.

As a\nrule, a modifier like the last “subject to” phrase in Section 271.152 applies to the nearest reasonable referent.28 The candidates\nare “contract”, “claim”, “adjudicating”, and “waives”. We do not think the phrase modifies “contract”. Earlier in the\nsentence, the Act is made applicable to any “contract subject to this subchapter”, and it would be needlessly redundant to\nreiterate a few words later that the contract is subject to the Act’s terms and conditions.29 Nor do we think the phrase modifies\n“claim”. Section 271.158,30 for example, provides only that the Act does not grant immunity and says nothing about the\nnature of the claim for which immunity is waived. And we do not think the “subject to” phrase modifies “adjudicating”. If it\ndid, only the adjudicatory process would be governed by the Act’s terms and conditions. This reading might make sense for\nthe recovery limits and preservation of procedures and defenses provided in Sections 271.153,31 271.154,32 and Section\n271.155,33 respectively. Those three sections relate to the litigation and adjudication *108 of a claim. But the other four\nsections, limiting the Act’s coverage to suits in state court on contract claims, providing that immunity is not granted, and\nprecluding a finding of joint enterprise, have little, if anything, to do with the adjudication on claims. These\nsections—271.156,34 271.157,35 271.158,36 and 271.160,37 respectively—relate to the scope of immunity rather than the\nconduct of litigation.\n\n28\n       See ANTONIN SCALIA & BRYAN A.

The waiver does not extend to tort suits, suits in federal court, or allow recovery beyond that\npermitted by Section 271.153. But Section 271.152, as qualified by this “subject to” phrase also does not preclude other\ndefenses or other contractual procedures, or confer immunity or suggest joint enterprise. The “subject to” phrase most\nreasonably refers to “waives”, thus making the provisions of the Act limitations on the waiver of immunity. Section 271.152\nmust be read as follows: “A local governmental entity ... waives sovereign immunity to suit ... subject to the terms and\nconditions” of the Act.\n\nWe reached this result in Tooke v. City of Mexia38 without the analysis just laid out because it seemed obvious. The Tookes\nsued the City of Mexia for breach of contract, “asserting that they had relied on a three-year term in purchasing equipment.\nThey claimed unspecified damages, but requested jury findings only on lost profits and attorney fees”.39 They did not claim\nthat the City failed to pay for work actually performed; rather, they sought recovery only for lost profits they would have\nmade had the contract continued—“consequential damages excluded from recovery under [Section 271.153].”40 Even though\nthe Tookes’ contract claim fell within Section 271.152,41 we concluded—because they did not “claim damages within\n[Section 271.153’s] limitations”—that “the City’s immunity from suit on the Tookes’ claim has not been waived.”42 This was\ntrue even though the Tookes might have proved that the City breached the contract.\n\n38\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1400009\"><a href=\"/opinion/1400009/tooke-v-city-of-mexia/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.2006).\n\n\n\n39\n       Id. at 330.\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Clear Lake City Water Authority43 to retreat from Tooke. There, developers sued\nan area water authority for reimbursement of part of their costs of building water and sewer facilities, which the authority had\nagreed to pay out of voter-approved bond funds.44 No bonds had been approved, but the developers claimed that the water\nauthority had breached the contract by campaigning against approval, thereby forestalling its reimbursement obligation.45 The\nwater authority argued in *109 part that because no bonds had been approved, its obligation to reimburse the developers had\nnot been triggered, nothing was “due and owed” under Section 271.153(a)(1), and for that reason, immunity was not\nwaived.46 In other words, because there was no liability, there were no recoverable damages and, therefore, no waiver of\nimmunity. But the premise—no liability—was disputed, and if the water authority had breached the contract by opposing\nbond approval, then the developers claimed only the reimbursement under the contract as damages. And such damages, we\nheld, were “due and owed” under Section 271.153(a)(1).47 “The purpose of section 271.153,” we explained, “is to limit the\namount due by a governmental agency on a contract once liability has been established, not to foreclose the determination of\nwhether liability exists.”48 We did not suggest that Section 271.153 permits a waiver of immunity from suit for a claim for\ndamages this Section prohibits altogether. The developers argued that they had damages recoverable under Section 273.153;49\nthey did not address, and we did not consider, whether immunity would have been waived for their claim of breach even if\nthey sought only damages not recoverable under Section 271.153. We would not have engaged in such an analysis without\nacknowledging the conflict with our opinion in Tooke.50\n\n43\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895256\"><a href=\"/opinion/895256/kirby-lake-dev-v-clear-lake-city-water/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">829</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.2010).\n\n\n\n44\n       Id. at 833–834.\n\n\n\n45\n       Id. at 834 (re 2006 bond election); see also Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v.

Sharyland sued the City for breach, claiming damages for injury to its system caused by\n          contractors engaged by the City under another contract to build a sanitary sewer system. We concluded that while the claim was\n          covered by Section 271.152 and was therefore one for which immunity was waived, the damages sought had nothing to do with the\n          contract between Sharyland and the City and thus were “not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract” recoverable under\n          Section 271.153. Id. at 413. As in Kirby Lake, however, the issue whether Section 271.153 is jurisdictional did not arise, and we\n          did not consider it.\n\n\n\n      The Austin Court of Appeals has laid out the case for confining the scope of the Act’s waiver to Section 271.152 in its\n[5] [6]\n\nopinion in City of San Antonio v. Lower Colorado River Authority.51 LCRA reasons that immunity from suit and immunity\nfrom liability are distinct concepts, that the former may be waived for a claim on which a governmental entity is not liable,\nand that the Act serves this very purpose.52 We agree with all but the conclusion. As we have explained, Section 271.153’s\nlimitations on recovery are incorporated into Section 271.152 by its last “subject to” clause and are thereby conditions on the\nAct’s waiver of immunity. We disagree with LCRA that this reading of the Act makes its waiver of immunity dependent on\nultimate liability. The Act waives immunity for contract claims that meet certain conditions: the existence of a specific type\nof contract, a demand for certain kinds of damages, a state forum, etc. The waiver does not depend on the outcome, though it\ndoes require a showing of a substantial claim that meets the Act’s conditions. LCRA argues that this view of the Act makes\nSection 271.153 a grant of immunity, a construction precluded by *110 Section 271.158. But again, Section 271.153 does not\nadd immunity that Section 271.152 takes away; Section 271.152 uses Section 271.153 to further define to what extent\nimmunity has been waived.\n\n51\n          </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.App.-Austin 2011, no pet.).\n\n\n\n52\n          369 S.W.3d at 235–238.\n\n\n[7]\n   By “substantial” claim we mean, as we held in Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife v. Miranda, that the claimant must\nplead facts with some evidentiary support that constitute a claim for which immunity is waived, not that the claimant will\nprevail.53 In Tooke, the only damages claimed were precluded by Section 271.153, and therefore immunity was not waived.\nHad the Tookes claimed payment for work done, immunity would have been waived, regardless of whether the Tookes could\nprevail, as long as the Tookes had some supporting evidence.\n\n53\n          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894512\"><a href=\"/opinion/894512/texas-dept-parks-and-wildlife-v-miranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226–228 (Tex.2004) (“When a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the pleadings, we determine if the pleader has\n          alleged facts that affirmatively demonstrate the court’s jurisdiction to hear the cause.

If the premise were true, then the conclusion would follow. “A including B” usually means that A is the larger group.\n       But the dissent’s “provided for or contemplated in” limitation simply is not in or suggested by the text. The “including” phrase\n       proves the flaw in the dissent’s position: “any amount as compensation for ... delay damages” (emphasis added), which amount\n       may or may not be provided for in the contract, cannot be included in “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” if that\n       phrase is limited to amounts provided for in the contract. Of course, “any Texas city, including Athens”, to use the dissent’s\n       example, is limited to one, but the example, like the dissent’s statutory construction, assumes a limitation to Texas cities when that\n       is the very issue in dispute. A more apt example is “a city, including any named Athens”, which is a longer list.\n\n\n[9]\n   Furthermore, Section 271.153(b) excludes from the “[d]amages awarded ... under a contract” consequential damages\nexcept as allowed in Subsection (a)(1). If the latter provision limited recovery to amounts stated in the contract, Subsection\n(b) would be surplusage: a claimant could recover all amounts stated in the contract, and all consequential damages stated in\nthe contract. Read together, Subsections (a)(1) and (b) allow recovery of contract damages, including delay damages, but\nexcluding other consequential damages. Nothing in the rest of Section 271.153 suggests that recoverable damages must be\nstated in the contract.66\n\n66\n       The dissent argues that damages “under” a contract are only those “provided for or contemplated in” the contract, but “under the\n       contract” is used to refer generally to damages available on a contract claim.

But we have repeatedly held that “[s]tatements made\nduring the legislative process by individual legislators or even a unanimous legislative chamber are not evidence of the\ncollective intent of the majorities of both legislative chambers that enacted a statute.”67 The Port also cites our opinion in\nKirby Lake, where we stated that the reimbursement obligation stated in the contract was “due and owed”.68 But we did not\nanalyze the phrase, and we certainly did not suggest that damages not set out in the contract cannot be “due and owed”.69\n\n67\n       Molinet v.

In that case a city contracted for construction of a\n       water supply system, and later the contractor sued for the cost of remediating injury to the system caused by the city’s sewer\n       contractors. Id. at 410–411. We concluded that the damages sought “were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water\n       Supply Agreement and [were] not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract. Nor [were] these costs the ‘direct result of\n       owner-caused delays or acceleration....’ ” Id. at 413. The dissent argues that the phrase, “provided for or contemplated in”, was\n       really intended to be a standard for determining whether an amount is “due and owed ... under” a contract. But the Court clearly\n       gave two independent reasons for concluding that the claimed damages were not recoverable: they were not “provided for or\n       contemplated in” the contract, “and” they were not “due and owed under” the contract. Sharyland’s claimed damages were not a\n       “balance due and owed” because they were completely unrelated to the Water Supply Agreement. And by adding, “nor” were the\n       damages for delay, referencing the “including” phrase in Section 157.053(a)(1), we suggested that if the damages had been for\n       delay, they would have been recoverable even if neither “due and owed under” nor “provided for or contemplated in” the contract.\n       We treated the “including” phrase in the statutory provision as stating independently that delay damages are recoverable. Instead of\n       supporting the dissent, Sharyland contradicts it.\n\n\n\n*114 [10] [11] [12] More than half a century ago, we observed that “[t]he universal rule for measuring damages for the breach of\na contract is just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.”70 While the Legislature clearly intended to limit the\nrecovery of consequential damages on contract claims permitted by the Act,71 nothing in the Act suggests that the Legislature\nintended to create a unique and somehow limited standard for measuring direct damages for breach of contract. Generally, a\ncontractor has a right to delay damages for breach of contract. The parties are free to modify or exclude it by agreement, but\nunless they do, the right provided by law is as much a part of the contract as the rights the contract expressly creates.72\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span>\n       <span class=\"reporter\">Stew.</span> <span class=\"page\">v</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.

The\n       dissent argues that the proviso states what is implicit in Section 271.153(a)(1). But if anything, the addition of the proviso suggests\n       that it was not intended in the other three statutes waiving immunity from suit on contract claims.\n          It should also be noted that the State Contract Claims Act was amended in 2005 (Act of May 27, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 988,\n          H.B.1940, § 1, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 3292), the same year the Local Government Contract Claims Act was adopted (Act of May\n          23, 2005, 79th Leg., R.S., ch. 604, H.B.2039, § 1, 2005 Tex. Gen. Laws 1548), to provide for recovery of delay damages, but did\n          so using the word “and” instead of “including”. Supra note 59. Using the dissent’s argument, one might contend that both\n          statutes intended that delay damages be recoverable whether or not provided for by contract.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

To conclude otherwise\nwould incentivize wrongful conduct and damage contractual relations. This conclusion is supported by lower court decisions\nin Texas88 and court decisions in at least 28 American jurisdictions.89 We join this overwhelming consensus. The Port *117\nargues that the cases from other jurisdictions are inapposite because those jurisdictions all recognize a party’s duty of good\nfaith in performing a contract, and Texas does not.90 But the law need not impose a duty of good faith on a party to prohibit\nhim from attempting to escape liability for his future, deliberate, wrongful conduct.

The Port also argues that Zachry is a sophisticated party, a very large construction company that can\nprotect itself. But the law’s protection against intentional injury is not limited to the helpless. Finally, the Port argues that the\nconduct found by the jury does not qualify for the exception.

For each progress payment, Zachry executed a document entitled “Affidavit and Partial\nRelease of Lien”, which contained the following language:\n\n            [Zachry] hereby acknowledges and certifies that [the Port Authority] has made partial payment to\n            [Zachry] on all sums owing on Payment Estimate Number [–––] and that it has no further claims\n            against [the Port Authority] for the portion of the Work completed and listed on the Schedule of Costs\n            in Payment Estimate Number [–––].\n\nZachry contends that the releases covered only liens. The Port counters that the releases covered all claims for payment. The\ntrial court concluded that the release language was ambiguous on the issue and charged the jury to determine its effect. The\njury failed to find that the release language covered Zachry’s claims for liquidated damages withheld by the Port. The court\nof appeals held that the releases unambiguously covered Zachry’s claim for liquidated damages and reversed.92 We agree that\nthe releases are unambiguous, but we conclude that they do not cover Zachry’s claim.\n\n92\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\nSection 6.07 of the contract conditioned the Port’s obligation to make progress payments on Zachry’s execution of “waivers\nand releases of liens” providing “that all amounts due and payable” to Zachry and all subcontractors and suppliers “have been\npaid in full” and that Zachry “waives, releases and relinquishes any lien ..., security interest and claim for payment”. The Port\nargues that the releases must be construed in light of this requirement because the contract and releases are related contracts\nand must be read together.93 While Section 6.07 could be read to require Zachry to release its claims for liquidated damages\nwithheld by the Port in order to obtain progress payments, that is not the issue. Had the Port insisted on express language to\nthat effect, and had Zachry refused, the interpretation of Section 6.07 would be important. Now, however, the issue is not\nwhat releases Zachry was contractually required to execute, but the effect of the releases Zachry actually did execute.\n\n93\n       City of Keller v.

Furthermore, Zachry actively disputed the Port’s\nright to withhold liquidated damages from the first time the Port did so, and that dispute was never resolved. The purpose of\nprogress payment releases is to ensure that the contractor will not accept payment for work performed and then insist on\nadditional payment for that work. Zachry’s releases can no more be interpreted to extend to its claim for liquidated damages\nthe Port withheld than to its claim for delay damages. The jury failed to find that the releases in fact covered Zachry’s claim.\nWe agree, as a matter of law.\n\nSecond: The trial court did not award Zachry the entirety of the $2.36 million in withheld payments because the jury found\nthat the Port was entitled to an offset of $970,000 as damages for Zachry’s use of defective wharf fenders. Zachry contends\nthat the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s finding.\n\nTo prove its claim for the offset, the Port submitted evidence that the wharf fenders, which protect vessels from damage\nduring the mooring process, were supposed to last for 30 years but became corroded after only 90 days. The Port’s expert\nwitness testified that this occurred because the fenders were improperly sealed and, as a result, “the aluminum pores [ ]\nremain[ed] open [and] filled with sea water.” A lab analysis and tests that a structural fabrication company conducted\nsupported the expert’s conclusion. Zachry contends that the evidence does not establish that it breached the contract because\nthe sealing or coating on the fenders was “thinned” at 25% in accordance with the contract specifications, and if more\nthinning was required then the blame lies with the specifications and not with Zachry. Even if there were a breach of contract,\nZachry argues that the evidence does not establish that the fenders were in fact defective or that the breach caused the\ndamages that the jury awarded.\n[16]\n    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, we cannot agree that the evidence was legally insufficient\nto support the jury’s verdict. Although Zachry submitted evidence that tended to contradict the Port’s evidence, we conclude\nthat there was “more than a mere scintilla” of evidence on which a reasonable jury could find that Zachry breached its\nobligation to provide fenders that were supposed to last 30 years by providing fenders that began corroding within 90 days,\nand that the Port sustained damages in the amount of $970,000 as a result, entitling it to an offset against the damages\nrecovered by Zachry.\n\nThird: The contract provided that “[i]f [Zachry] brings any claim against the Port Authority and [Zachry] does not prevail\nwith respect to such claim, [Zachry] shall be liable for all attorney’s fees incurred by the Port Authority as a result of such\nclaim.” The jury found that the Port incurred $10.5 million in attorney fees as a result of Zachry’s claim for delay damages,\nplus additional fees on appeal. Separately, the jury found that the Port incurred $80,250 in attorney fees as a result of\nZachry’s claim to recover the payments that the Port withheld as liquidated damages, plus additional fees on appeal. In light\nof our holdings that Zachry prevails on both its claims for delay damages and to recover part of the withheld payments, we\nreverse the court of appeals’ judgment awarding the Port attorney fees.\n\n******\n\nWe hold that Zachry’s claim for delay damages is not barred by immunity or by the no-damages-for-delay provision of the\ncontract. We also hold that Zachry is entitled to recover the liquidated damages *120 withheld by the Port, but that there is\nevidence to support the jury’s award of an offset. We conclude that the court of appeals erred in awarding the Port attorney\nfees. We reverse the court of appeals’ judgment, and because the Port has raised a number of other issues, we remand the\ncase to that court for further consideration.\n\n\n\n\nJustice BOYD filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice JOHNSON, Justice WILLETT, and Justice LEHRMANN joined.\n\nJustice BOYD, joined by Justice JOHNSON, Justice WILLETT, and Justice LEHRMANN, dissenting in part.\n\nChapter 271 of the Texas Local Government Code waives a local governmental entity’s immunity against suits for breach of\nwritten contracts for goods and services, but it does so only to allow contractors to recover “the balance due and owed by the\nlocal governmental entity under the contract.” TEX.

In fact, in this contract,\nZachry expressly agreed that the Port Authority would never owe damages for costs that Zachry incurred due to any delay or\nhindrance. The Court invalidates this no-damages-for-delay clause for public policy reasons. But even after striking that\nclause, the contract does not provide for or in any way contemplate that the Port Authority would pay for Zachry’s delay\ncosts. Because delay costs are not part of “the balance due and owed by [the Port Authority] under [this] contract,” I would\nhold that Chapter 271 does not waive the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim for delay damages, and I would\ndismiss that claim for lack of jurisdiction. Because governmental immunity bars Zachry’s claim for delay damages, I would\nnot reach the issue of whether the no-damages-for-delay clause is void for public policy reasons. I therefore respectfully\ndissent in part.1\n\n1\n       For the reasons the Court explains, I agree with its holding in Part II(A) that section 271.153’s limitation on recoverable damages\n       is jurisdictional because chapter 271 “does not waive immunity from suit on a claim for damages not recoverable under Section\n       271.153.” Ante at 110. I would not reach the public policy issue in Part III of the Court’s opinion. In Part IV of its opinion, the\n       Court holds that Zachry can recover on its separate claim for $2.36 million that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated damages,\n       less a $970,000 offset for damages resulting from Zachry’s use of defective wharf fenders. Ante at 119. I agree with this portion of\n       the Court’s opinion, for the reasons the Court has explained. The funds that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated damages\n       were part of the monthly progress payments that the Port Authority agreed to make for Zachry’s services and were part of “the\n       balance due and owed ... under the contract.” Section 271.153 thus waives the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim to\n       recover those funds, and the courts have jurisdiction to resolve that claim. The mere fact that the Port Authority denies liability on\n       the claim does not negate the statute’s waiver of immunity from suit for damages that are provided for or clearly contemplated\n       under the contract. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE §§ 271.152–.153.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    I.\n\n\n\n                                      Governmental Immunity Against Contract Actions\n\nAs a local governmental entity, the Port Authority “enjoy[s] governmental immunity from suit, unless immunity is expressly\nwaived.” Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v.

Thus, although\n“[t]he doctrine of governmental immunity arose hundreds of years ago from the idea that ‘the king can do no wrong,’ ... it\nremains a fundamental principle of Texas law, intended ‘to shield the public from the costs and consequences of improvident\nactions of their governments.’ ” Lubbock Cnty.

In some circumstances, however, justice may demand that the\ngovernment compensate innocent injured parties even though innocent taxpayers must pay the bill. The challenge is in\ndeciding which circumstances justify a waiver of immunity to allow for such compensation.\n\nBecause this decision “requires balancing numerous policy considerations, we have consistently deferred to the Legislature,\nas the public’s elected representative body, to decide whether and when to waive the government’s immunity.” Lubbock\nCnty., 442 S.W.3d at 301.

If a statute seeks to waive immunity, it “must do so beyond doubt.” Wichita Falls State\nHosp., 106 S.W.3d at 697.\n\nFor the first 154 years of Texas’ existence, parties who contracted with the government could not recover for the\ngovernment’s breach unless they first convinced the Legislature to pass a special resolution waiving immunity for their\nspecific claim. See Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 408 (reaffirming previous holdings that “the State is immune from suit arising\nfrom breach of contract suits”); TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 107.001–.005 (governing resolutions granting\npermission to sue the State). Not surprisingly, this often made it difficult for governmental entities to find qualified\ncontractors who were willing to provide goods and services. In 1999, the Legislature enacted Chapter 2260 of the Texas\nGovernment Code, providing an administrative procedure through which parties to certain contracts with a State agency or\ndepartment could recover damages for the agency’s breach. See TEX. GOV’T CODE §§ 2260.001–.108. Chapter 2260 did\nnot waive the State’s immunity, id. § 2260.006, but instead provided an alternative administrative process through which the\ncontractor could seek relief. See id. The statute provides this option only for parties to certain kinds of contracts, and it limits\nthe administrative award to $250,000 unless the Legislature *122 separately authorizes a higher award in a specific case. See\nid. § 2260.105.2\n\n2\n       Under chapter 2260, an administrative law judge can only award up to $250,000 for a valid breach of contract claim. See TEX.\n       GOV’T CODE § 2260.105. Valid claims above $250,000 are referred to the Legislature to decide, in light of appropriate policy\n       considerations, whether to authorize additional funds for payment of the claim. See id. § 2260.1055; Gen. Servs. Comm’n v.\n       Little–Tex Insulation Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 (Tex.2001).\n\n\n\nAlthough Chapter 2260 provides a limited avenue of relief for those who contract with State agencies and departments,3 it\nprovides no remedy at all for those who contract with a local governmental entity. The Legislature first addressed local\ngovernmental entities in 2003, when it enacted a limited waiver of immunity for certain breach of contract suits against Texas\ncounties. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 262.007. Then, in 2005, the Legislature enacted the provisions of Chapter 271\nthat are at issue in this case, providing the same limited waiver for certain breach of contract suits against all other types of\nlocal governmental entities. See id. §§ 271.151–.160. Most recently, in 2013, the Legislature enacted Chapter 114 of the\nTexas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, providing the same limited waiver of immunity from suits for certain contract claims\nagainst State agencies. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §§ 114.001–.013.\n\n3\n       See TEX. GOV’T CODE § 2260.001(4) (defining “unit of state government”).\n\n\n\nAs it had done in Chapter 2260, the Legislature strictly limited the immunity waivers in Chapters 262, 271, and 114, not only\nin terms of the types of contracts under which a party can sue, but also in terms of the types and amounts of damages the\nparty can recover. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE §§ 262.007(b), (c), 271.153; TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE §\n114.004. Thus, the Legislature has only recently acted to waive immunity for contract claims, and each time it has done so, it\nhas strictly limited the scope of that waiver. Respectful of the Legislature’s prerogative to decide whether, when, and how to\nwaive the State’s immunity, and mindful of our obligation to find waivers only in “clear and unambiguous language” that\nleaves “no doubt,” we must carefully and strictly construe and apply these statutory limitations. I dissent in this case because\nthe Court’s holding that Zachry’s delay damages are recoverable under section 271.153 ignores the statute’s limitations.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                II.\n\n\n\n                                                         Section 271.153\n\nSection 271.153 is entitled “LIMITATIONS ON ADJUDICATION AWARDS.” Id. § 271.153 (emphasis added).4 Consistent\n*123 with its title, subsection (a) of section 271.153 identifies three exclusive categories of damages that a contractor can\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

And while I agree that “the balance due and\nowed ... under the contract” can include “compensation for ... owner-caused delays,” compensation for owner-caused delays\nare not part of the balance due and owed under this contract, which stated that the contractor “shall receive no financial\ncompensation for delay or hindrance to the Work ...

The term “due” means (1) “payable; owing; constituting a debt,”\nwhen used in relation to a “fact of indebtedness,” or (2) “immediately enforceable,” when used in relation to “the time of\npayment.” Bryan A. Garner, A DICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE, 298–99 (2nd ed.); see also Black’s Law\nDictionary 609 (10th Ed.). The Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage notes that the second definition, “immediately\nenforceable,” is “almost invariably the applicable one” today. DICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 299. And\nthe term “owing” means “[t]hat is yet to be paid; owed; due.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1279 (10th Ed.); see also\nDICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 633 (noting that “owed” is the preferred modern usage, over “owing”).\nThe difference between the terms “due” and “owed” is reflected in the fact that something can be owed but not yet due\nbecause the date for payment or the contingency on which payment is conditioned has not yet come to pass. See\nDICTIONARY OF MODERN LEGAL USAGE at 299. A “balance” that is both “due” and “owed” is thus an amount by\nwhich an account’s debits exceed its credits that is yet to be paid and immediately enforceable. Stated another way, a balance\ndue and owed is a mature debt. This understanding of the phrase is consistent with both the statutory context, which relates to\nrecoverable monetary obligations under a contract, and with our prior use of the phrase “due and owed” or “due and owing,”\nboth in our construction of this statute and more generally.6\n\n6\n       See, e.g., Kirby Lake Dev., Ltd. v.

LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1). Under the “rules of grammar,” see TEX. GOV’T CODE § 311.011,\na preposition (here, “under”) imposes a relationship between its object (here, “the contract”) and its antecedent (here, “the\nbalance due and owed”). See, e.g., THE CHICAGO MANUAL OF STYLE § 5.173, at 248 (16th ed.); Bryan A. Garner, THE\nREDBOOK: A MANUAL ON LEGAL STYLE, 176 (2nd ed.). As a result, section 271.153(a)(1) does not allow recovery of\nall amounts that may be “due and owed by the local governmental entity,” but instead limits the recovery to a due-and-owed\nbalance that arises “under” the written contract for goods and services *125 to which the statute applies. See TEX. LOCAL\nGOV’T CODE §§ 271.151(2)(A), 271.153(a)(1). Thus, under section 271.153(a)(1), the amount recoverable “is limited to”\nthe amount of all mature debts owed under a qualified contract, less any credits due.\n\nThe Court, by contrast, concludes that “[a] ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of damages for\nbreach of contract payable and unpaid.” Ante at 111. I do not agree that a “balance due and owed ... under a contract”\nincludes all common law damages regardless of whether they are contemplated in the parties’ contract. When a payment is\nnot provided for under the contract, but instead arises under the common law, that payment may later be due and owed under\nthe cort’s jud Aent, MMs not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.” See TEX.

Sup. Ct. J.</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\nThe Court’s construction of the statute is contrary to the statute’s language and its structure. First, the Court’s construction\nseparates the phrase “balance due and owed” from the phrase “under the contract,” and then alternatively reads each of them\nout of the statute. On the one hand, the Court equates the phrase “the balance due and owed” with the phrase “damages ...\npayable and unpaid,” ante at 111, and by doing so ignores the statute’s actual words. On the other hand, the Court treats the\nphrase “under the contract” as if it said “under a court’s judgment,” but does so only by relying on court opinions that address\ndamages under a contract, not a “balance due and owed ... under a contract.” Ante at 111 n. 62, 64. We must read the two\nphrases together, just as they appear in the statute, and the Court’s alternatives for each simply are not equivalents. By\nequating “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” with “the amount of damages for breach of contract payable and\nunpaid,” the Court shifts the focus from the mature debt that exists “under the contract” when suit is filed to prospective\nliability that a Court may impose in a breach of contract action.\n\nSecond, by holding that “a ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of damages for breach of\ncontract payable and unpaid,” the Court renders subsection (a)(1) a tautology. Under the Court’s construction, the amount of\ndamages that is recoverable for a breach of contract is “limit [ed]” to the amount of damages that is recoverable for a breach\nof contract. Under that construction, the amount of damages is not “limit[ed]” at all.7\n\n7\n       In response, the Court contends that the statute does “limit [ ] recovery” because “damages are but one item in a list that includes\n       attorney’s fees and interest, even if not provided for in the contract.” Ante at 113 n. 66. But section 271.153(a) places\n       “LIMITATIONS ON ADJUDICATION AWARDS” by authorizing courts to award only amounts that fall within the expressly\n       enumerated categories, which under the current version of the statute include:\n               • certain types of damages: “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” under section 271.153(a)(1) and “the amount\n               owed for change orders or additional work” under (a)(2);\n               • certain types of attorney’s fees: “reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees that are equitable and just” under (a)(3); and\n               • all interest allowed by law under (a)(4).\n          See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153. The Court’s reading of section (a)(1) does not alter the scope of recoverable\n          attorney’s fees or interest, it simply expands the scope of authorized damages to include all recoverable damages. Therefore, it\n          does not limit recoverable damages at all.\n\n\n\nThird, the Court’s construction of subsection (a)(1) renders subsection (a)(2) superfluous. Subsection (a)(2) expressly\nauthorizes the recovery of “the amount owed *126 for change orders or additional work the contractor is directed to perform\nby a local governmental entity in connection with the contract.” TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(2). If, as the\nCourt holds, subsection (a)(1) authorizes the recovery of all common law damages recoverable for breach of the contract,\nthen subsection (a)(1) already authorizes recovery of amounts owed for change orders and additional work, and subsection\n(a)(2) adds nothing to the mix.8 But if, as I contend, subsection (a)(1) only authorizes recovery of the amounts actually\nprovided for or contemplated within the contract (that is, “the balance due and owed ... under the contract”), then subsection\n(a)(2) adds to that any amounts owed for change orders and additional work that were not originally provided for or\ncontemplated in the parties’ contract.\n\n8\n       The Court responds that its construction does not render subsection (a)(2) superfluous because subsection (a)(2) “clarifies that\n       change orders can be the basis for recovery, even if it were argued that they were not ‘under the contract.’ ” Ante at 113 n. 66. But\n       this is exactly the point: under the Court’s construction, there is no need for such clarification because everything that the law\n       permits to be a basis for recovery in a breach of contract action (the only claim that can be brought under the statute) can be the\n       basis for recovery under the 271.153(a), regardless of whether it is “under the contract.”\n\n\n\nFinally, under the Court’s construction of subsection (a)(1), the exception to the exclusion of consequential damages in\nsubsection (b)(1) would completely swallow the rule. Subsection (b)(1) provides that recoverable damages may not include\n“consequential damages, except as expressly allowed under Subsection (a)(1).” Id. § 271.153(b)(1). As the Court notes,\n“[d]elay damages are consequential damages.” Ante at 114 n. 71. If subsection (a)(1) authorizes the recovery of all common\nlaw damages for breach of contract, then consequential damages, which are recoverable for a breach of contract, are\n“expressly allowed under Subsection (a)(1).” And in that case, subsection (b)(1) would not exclude any consequential\ndamages. See TEX. LOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1), (b). In short, under the Court’s construction, subsection (a),\nwhich says recoverable amounts are “limited” to those specified in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4), does not in fact “limit”\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

We have addressed\nsection 271.1 53(a)(1) in three prior decisions, and in each of them we have held, or at least indicated, that a “balance” is\n“due and owed ... under the contract” only if it is “stipulated,” “provided for,” or at least “contemplated” within the parties’\nwritten agreement. See Sharyland Water Supply Corp. v. City of Alton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">354</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (Tex.2011) (“The kind of\ndamages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and are not a\n‘balance due and owed’ under that contract.”); Kirby Lake, 320 S.W.3d at 840 (holding that the damages sought were part of\nthe balance due and owed under the contract because “the Agreements do stipulate the amount of reimbursement owed upon\napproval of bond funds”); Tooke, 197 S.W.3d at 346 (holding that lost profits from additional work “are consequential\ndamages excluded from recovery under the statute”).\n\nIn Tooke, the Court held that the claimants could not recover after the City of Mexia prematurely terminated their service\ncontract because they “claim [ed] only lost profits on additional work they should have been given,” which “are\nconsequential *127 damages excluded from recovery under the statute.” 197 S.W.3d at 346; see TEX. LOCAL GOV’T\nCODE § 271.153(b)(1). If, as the Court holds today, “a ‘balance due and owed ... under the contract’ is simply the amount of\ndamages for breach of contract payable and unpaid,” ante at 125, the Tookes should have been able to recover lost profits\nunder section 271.153(a)(1), and they should not have been excluded as consequential damages under subsection (b)(1)\nbecause they fall within the exception for consequential damages expressly authorized under subsection (a)(1). In short, the\nlost profits in Tooke were consequential damages not authorized under the parties contract, just as the Court recognizes\nZachry’s delay damages to be. Yet we held that the Tookes’ lost profits were not recoverable even though they, like Zachry’s\ndelay damages, were “damages ... payable and unpaid” and recoverable under the common law for breach of contract.\n\nSimilarly, in Sharyland, the contractor, the Sharyland Water Supply Corporation, sought to recover its “increased cost to\nperform” its contractual duty to repair and maintain a water system, which allegedly resulted from the City of Alton’s breach\nof its own contractual duties. 354 S.W.3d at 413. We held that section 271.153(a)(1) did not authorize Sharyland to recover\nits increased repair and maintenance costs because “[t]he kind of damages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for\nor contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and are not a ‘balance due and owed’ under that contract.” Id.9\n\n9\n       The Court notes that, in the next sentence in Sharyland, the Court stated: “Nor were these costs the ‘direct result of owner-caused\n       delays or acceleration....’ ” Ante at 113 n. 69 (quoting Sharyland, 354 S.W.3d at 413). The Court asserts that, by this sentence, we\n       treated the “including” clause at the end of subsection 271.153(a)(1) “as stating independently that delay damages are\n       recoverable,” and “we suggested that if [the damages sought had been for owner-caused delays], they would have been recoverable\n       even if neither ‘due and owed under’ nor ‘provided for or contemplated in’ the contract.” Id. The Court reads far too much into this\n       language. What we actually said in Sharyland was:\n             The kind of damages sought by Sharyland were not those provided for or contemplated in the Water Supply Agreement and\n             are not a “balance due and owed” under that contract. Nor are these costs the “direct result of owner-caused delays or\n             acceleration,” or the “amount owed for change orders or additional work the contractor [was] directed to perform by [the]\n             local governmental entity in connection with the contract.”\n          Sharyland, 354 S.W.3d at 413. We thus addressed all provisions of subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2), demonstrating that there was\n          no possible basis on which any of them could have authorized the recovery of the repair and maintenance costs that Sharyland\n          sought. See id. Sharyland did not argue that its damages were independently recoverable as “owner-caused delay damages,” and\n          we did not address the issue for which the Court now cites this language. See id. Instead, we simply explained that the damages\n          Sharyland sought did not fit within any of the descriptions in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2). See id. And, consistent with Tooke and\n          Kirby Lake, we equated “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” with the amounts “provided for or contemplated” in\n          the parties’ agreement. See id. I address the issue of whether the “including” clause at the end of subsection (a)(1) authorizes\n          delay damages that are not “due and owed ... under the contract” in the next section.\n\n\n\nIn Kirby Lake, by contrast, we held that the damages the claimant sought were recoverable as “the balance due and owed ...\nunder the contract” because “the Agreements do stipulate the amount of reimbursement owed upon approval of bond funds.”\n320 S.W.3d at 840 (emphasis added). Consistent with the language of the statute and our precedent, I would hold that section\n271.153 does not authorize Zachry to recover its delay damages because those damages are not provided for or contemplated\nin the parties’ agreement, *128 which instead expressly bars recovery of delay costs, and thus are not part of “the balance due\nand owed by the [Port Authority] under the contract.” See TEX.

To the extent the Court is arguing that the statute authorizes recovery\nof amounts that are not quantified in the contract or ascertainable at the time of contracting, I agree. Amounts need not be\nquantified in the contract or ascertainable at the time of contracting to be “due and owed ... under the contract.” Delay costs,\nin particular, cannot be quantified at the time of contracting because the parties cannot predict the length of the delay or how\nthe delay will impact the contractor’s work. But parties can, and sometimes do, agree that the owner will compensate the\ncontractor for owner-caused delays, and when they do, the delay costs are recoverable under the statute. Here, however, the\nparties did not agree that the Port Authority would compensate Zachry for owner-caused delays; instead, they expressly\nagreed that Zachry would receive “no financial compensation for delay or hindrance to the Work ... EVEN IF SUCH DELAY\nOR HINDRANCE” was owner-caused.\n\nThe Court misconstrues the language at the end subsection (a)(1) to independently authorize recovery of “any amount owed\nas compensation ... for owner-caused delays,” even if that amount is not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the\ncontract.” Ante at 111. In doing so, the Court overlooks the key word that connects these two phrases: “including.” The word\n“including” in this subsection does not expand the meaning of the words that come before it (“the balance due and owed”);\nrather, it limits the meaning of the words that come after it (“any [owner-caused delay damages]”) to “include” only those\nowner-caused delay damages that are in fact “due and owed.” See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY at 766 (defining\n“include” to mean “contain as part of something”). The Court thus reads subsection (a)(1) as authorizing recovery of the\nbalance due and owed ... under the contract and (or plus) any delay damages, when in fact the statute authorizes recovery of\n“the balance due and owed ... under the contract ..., including any amount owed ” as damages for owner-caused delays. TEX.\nLOCAL GOV’T CODE § 271.153(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n\nFor example, if a franchise agreement authorized a franchisee to operate “in any Texas city, including Athens,” the agreement\nwould permit operations in Athens, Texas, but not in Athens, Greece, or Athens, Georgia. The word “including” is not a\nsynonym for the word “and.” It does not expand the meaning of “any Texas city” to include Athens, Greece, or Athens,\nGeorgia, merely because those cities are also named “Athens.” Instead, it limits the scope of the reference to “Athens” to the\n“Texas city” by that name.10 In the *129 same way, the word “including” in subsection 271.153(a)(1) does not mean “and.” It\ndoes not expand the meaning of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract” to include “owner-caused delay damages”\nthat are not due and owed under the contract. Instead, it limits the scope of the reference to “owner-caused delay damages” to\nthose “owner-caused delay damages” that are part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.”\n\n10\n       Or, to use the Court’s “more apt example,” see ante at 112 n. 65, the phrase “a city, including any named Athens,” includes any\n       city named Athens, which (as the Court notes) is “a longer list,” but it still only “includes” cities named Athens. It would not\n       include a corporation, or person, or pet named “Athens,” because the word “including” limits the second word “Athens” to those\n       that fit within the first word “city.” In the same way, the word “including” in section 271.153(a)(1) limits the second phrase “delay\n       damages” to those that fit within the first phrase “balance due and owed ... under the contract.” Any delay damages that are not part\n       of the balance due and owed under the contract are not “included” in the statute’s waiver.\n\n\n\nThe language the Legislature used in its most recent statutory waiver of immunity for breach of contract suits further\nconfirms this point. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE § 114.004. In this statute, through which the Legislature waived\nimmunity for certain contract claims against state agencies just last year, the Legislature used the same language it used in\nsection 271.153, but added a final clause to further clarify that the amount recoverable “is limited to”:\n\n            the balance due and owed by the state agency under the contract as it may have been amended,\n            including any amount owed as compensation for the increased cost to perform the work as a direct\n            result of owner-caused delays or acceleration if the contract expressly provides for that\n            compensation....\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

While the Court contends that the inclusion of the emphasized language gives this\nstatute a meaning that is different than the meaning of section 271.153(a)(1), which does not include the emphasized\nlanguage, that contention is unsupportable within this context. The language of sections 114.004 and 271.153 (and, for that\nmatter, 262.007) are in all material respects the same, demonstrating that the Legislature intended to follow a uniform\napproach in strictly limiting the scope of these statutory waivers of immunity. More importantly, by using the same\n“including” language that appears in section 271.153, section 114.004 confirms that both statutes only permit recovery of\nowner-caused delay damages that are “included” within “the balance due and owed ... under the contract.” If anything,\nsection 114.004(a)(1) narrows the scope of recoverable damages by requiring that the contract “expressly provide[ ] for” the\npayment of such compensation.\n\nParties to construction contracts often allocate unquantified costs between themselves, just as Zachry and the Port Authority\ndid with delay costs. Zachry and the Port Authority allocated all of Zachry’s delay-related expenses and losses to Zachry,\neven if the Port Authority was at fault for the delay. But parties to construction contracts sometimes choose a different\nallocation, obligating an owner to reimburse the contractor for some or all owner-caused delay costs.

But since the Port Authority did not agree to pay any of Zachry’s delay damages, and the contract does not\nprovide for or contemplate the Port Authority’s payment of such damages, those damages are not part of “the balance due and\nowed ... under the contract” and thus are not recoverable under section 271.153.\n\n\n\n\n                                                            III.\n\n\n\n                                                        Conclusion\n\nI agree with the Court that Zachry’s claim to recover installment payments that the Port Authority withheld as liquidated\ndamages are recoverable under section 271.153 and that Zachry did not unambiguously release that claim, but I would hold\nthat section 271.153 does not waive the Port Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s claim for delay damages. Based on the\nlanguage and our prior constructions of the statute, I would hold that section 271.153 permits an award of delay damages\nonly if those damages are provided for or contemplated in the agreement and are thus part of “the balance due and owed ...\nunder the contract.” Because this contract did not provide for or contemplate the Port Authority’s payment of Zachry’s delay\ndamages, I would hold that Zachry’s delay damages are not part of “the balance due and owed ... under the contract”; section\n271.153 therefore does not authorize an award of those damages in this case; and thus section 271.152 does not waive the\nPort Authority’s immunity against Zachry’s suit for such damages.\n\n\n\nParallel Citations\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.

You arc the sole judges of the credibility o        c\n            witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, but in matters of law, you must be\n            governed by the instructions in this charge. In discharging your responsibility on this jury, you\n            will observe all the instructions which have previously been given you. I shall now give you\n            additional instructions which you should ~.:arefully and strictly follow during your deliberations.\n\n                           I.     Do not let bias, prejudice or sympathy play any part in your deliberations.\n\n                          2.      In arriving at your answers, consider only the evidence introduced here\n                   under oath and such exhibits, if any, as have been introduced for your consider:.~tion\n                   under the rulings of the court, that is, what you have seen and heard in this courtroom,\n                   together with the law as given you by the court. In your deliberations, you will not\n                   consider or discuss anything that is not represented by the evidence in this case.\n\n                          3.       Since every answer that is required by the charge is important, no juror\n                   should state or consider that any required answer is not important.\n\n                          4.      You must not decide who you think should win, and then try to answer the\n                   questions accordingly. Simply answer the questions, und do not discuss nor concem\n                   yourselves with the effect of your answers.\n\n                           5.      You will not decide the answer to a question by lot or by drawing straws,\n                   or by any other method of chance. Do not return a quotient verdict. A quotient verdict\n                   means that the jurors agree to abide by the result to be reached by adding together each\n                   juror's figures and dividing by the number of jurors to get an average. Do not do any\n                   trading on your answers; that is, one juror should not agree to answer a certain question\n                   one way if others will agree to answer another question another way.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                        1738€\n\f                6.\n                       •                                           •\n                      Unless otherwise instructed, you may answer a question upon the vote of\n       ten or more jurors. If you answer more than one question upon the vote of ten or more\n       jw-ors, the same group of at least ten of you must agree upon tho answers to each of those-\n       questions.\n\n       These instructions are given you becauseyour conduct is subject to review the same us\nthat of the witnesses, parties, attorneys and the judge. If it should be found that you have\ndisregarded any of these instructions, it will be jury misconduct and it may require another trial\nby another jury; then all of our time will have been wasted.\n\n      The presiding juror or any other who observes a violation of the court's instructions shall\nimmediately warn the one who is violating the same and caution the juror not to do so again.\n\n       When words are used in this charge in a sense that varies from the meaning commonly\nunderstood, you arc given a proper legal definition, which you are bound to accept in place of\nany other meaning.\n\n        1\\nsw<..-r \"Y cs\" or \"No\" to all questions unless otherwise instructed. A \"Y cs\" answer must\nbe based on a preponderance of the evidence unless you are othenvise instructed. If you do not\nfind that a preponderance of the evidence supports a \"Yes\" answer, then answer \"No.\" The tem1\n·'preponderance of the evidence\" means the greater weight of credible evidence admitted in this\ncase. A preponderance of the evidence is not measured by the number of witnesses or by the\nnumber of documents admitted in evidence. For a fact to be proved by a preponderance of the\nevidence, you must find that the fact is more likely true than not true. Whenever u question\nrequires an answer other than \"Y cs\" or \"No,\" your answer must be based on a preponderance of\nthe evidence unless you arc otherwise instructed.\n\n        A fact may be established by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or both. A\nfact is established by direct evidence when proved by documentary evidence or by witnesses\nwho saw the act done or heard the words spoken. A fact is established by circumstantial evidence\nwhen it may be fairly and reasonably inferred from other facts prOV(.:d.\n\n        A party's conduct includes the conduct of another who acts with the party's authority or\napparent authority. A party's knowledge includes facts known to the party acting with the other\nparty's authority, and which arc material lo the duties of the party acting with the other party's\nauthority.\n\n        Authority for another to act for a party must arise from the party's agreement that the\nother act on behalf and for the benefit of the party. If a party so authorizes another to perform an\nact, that other party is also authorized to do whutevcr else is proper, usual, and necessary to\nperform the act expressly authorized.\n\n        Apparent authority exists if u party ( 1) knowingly permits another to hold himself out ns\nhaving authority or, (2) through lack of ordinary care, bestows on another such indication~ of\nauthority that lead a reasonably prudent person to rely on the apparent existence of authority to\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f                       •                                           •\nhis detriment. Only the acts of the party sought to be charged with responsibility for the conduct\nof another may be considered in determining whether apparent authority exists.\n\n       The following definitions apply in this charge.\n\n        \"The Contract\" means the Bayport Terminal Complex Phase lA Wharf and Dredging\nContract. Unless otherwise specified, sections of the Contract that are used in this Charge are\nfrom the General Conditions of the Contract. The Contract consists of the Contract Documents\nas defined in §1.10 ofthe Contract.\n\n       \"Port\" means the Port of 1Iouston Authority of Harris County, Texas.\n\n        \"Zachry'' is the Contractor under the Contract with the Port. Before January 1, 2008, it\nwas called Zachry Construction Corporation. From and after January I, 2008, it is called Zachry\nIndustrial, Inc.\n\n       \"New Zachry\" is Zachry's subcontractor under the Management Services Agreement, PX\n643, from and after January I, 2008. From and after January 1, 2008, New Zachry is called\nZachry Construc-tion Corporation.\n\n        After you retire to the jury room, you will select your own presiding juror. The first thing\nthe presiding juror will do is to have this complete charge read aloud and then you will deliberate\nupon your answers to the questions asked.\n\n       It is the duty of the presiding juror-\n\n               1.      to preside during your deliberations,\n\n               2.      to sec that your deliberations arc conducted in an orderly manner and in\n                       accordance with the instructions in this charge,\n\n               3.      to write out and hand to the bailiff any communications concerning the\n                       case that you desire to have delivered to the judge,\n\n               4.      to vote on the questions.\n\n               5.      to write your answers to lhe questions in the spaces provided, and\n\n               6.      to certify to your verdict in the space provided tbr the presiding juror's\n                       signature or to obtain the signatures of all the jurors. who agree with the\n                       verdict if your verdict is less than unanimous.\n\n       You should not discuss the case with anyone, not even with other members of the jury,\nunless all of you are present and assembled in the jury room. Should anyone attempt to talk to\nyou about the case before the verdict is returned, whether at the courthouse, at your home, or\nelsewhere, please inform the judge of this fact.\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f                      •                                           •\n        When you have answered all the questions .you arc required to answer under the\ninstructions of the judge and your presiding juror has placed your answers in. the spaces provided-\nand signed the verdict as presiding juror or obtained the signatures, you will inform the bailiff at\nthe door of the jury room that you have reached a verdict, and then you will return into court\nwith your verdict.\n\n\n\n                                             JUDGE PRESrDING\n                       JAN 2 1 ?010\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                          1\n\f                        •               Question No. I\n                                                                 •\n       Did the Port fail to comply with Change Order 4?\n\n       It is your duty to interpret the language of Change Order 4 and the Scope, Time, and\nPrice Modifications to Specifications and Proposal attached to Change Order 4.\n\n        You must decide its meaning by detcnnining the intent of the parties at the time of the\nagreement. Consider all the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement,\nthe interpretation placed on the agreement by the parties, and the conduct of the parties.\n\n       In answering this question only, you are not being asked to decide whether the Port failed\nto comply with § 5.10 of the Contract.\n\n       Furthermore, in answering this question, you are instructed that nothing in § 5.41 gave\nthe Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response to the September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff\nwall design.\n\n       Answer ''yes\" or ''no.\"\n\n\n       Answer: _'[1_.___£;..::...(7\n                                _ __\n\n\n\n\n                                                5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                        17390\n\f                       •                                          •\n                                         Question No.2\n\n       Did the Port fail to comply with§ 5.10 ofthe General Conditions?\n\n       In answering this question, it is your duty to interpret §§ 5.10 and 5.22 and the terms\ncontained therein.\n\n        You must decide the meaning of these provisions of the Contract by determining the\nintent of the parties at the time of the agreement. Consider all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding the making of the agreement, the interpretation placed on the agreement by the\nparties, and the conduct of the parties.\n\n        In determining the meaning of these provisions, you may also consider a trade custom or\nusage, if any, if you find that such trade custom or usage existed. However, a trade custom or\nusage, if any, cannot vary, control, impair, restrict or enlarge the express language of the\nContract. A trade custom or usage exists if it is a practice so generally or universally well known\nand used in the industry that the parties to a contract are charged with knowledge of its existence\nto such an extent as to raise the presumption that the parties contracted with reference to it.\n\n       Furthermore, in answering this question, you arc instructed that nothing in § 5.41 gave\nthe Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response to the September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff\nwall design.\n\n\n\n       Answer \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\n\n       Answer:    ~£';\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                         1\n\f                        •                                           •\n      If you answered \"yes'' to Question No. I and/or 2, then answer the following question.\nOtherwise, do not answer the following question.\n\n                                          Question No. 3\n\n       What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, would fairly and reasonably compensate\nZachry for its damages, if any, that resulted from the Port's failure to comply?\n\n       Consider the following elements of damages, if any, and none other.\n\n       A.      The balance due and owed by the Port, if any, under the Contract, including any\n               amount owed as compensation for any increased cost to perform the work as a\n               direct result of Port-caused delays, and\n\n       B.

Equitable estoppel\n\n       Failure to comply by the Port is excused if Zachry is equitably estopped from asserting\n       that f<1ilure to comply. Equitable estoppel is established if all of the following\n       circumstances occurred:\n\n       I.       Zachry\n                a.     by words or conduct made a false representation or ~.:oncealed material\n                       facts when there was a duty to disclose,\n                b.     with knowledge of the facts or with knowledge or information that would\n                       lead a reasonable person to discover the facts, and\n                c.     with the intention that the Port would rely on the false representation or\n                       concealment in acting or deciding not to act; and\n\n       2.

Quasi-estoppel\n\n     Failure to comply by the Port is excused if the doctrine of quasi-estoppel applies. Quasi-\n     estoppel bars a party from asserting, to another's disadvantage, a right inconsistent with a\n     position previously taken by that party. This doctrine applies when it would be\n     unconscionable to allow a party to maintain a position inconsistent with one in which it\n     had acquiesced, or from which it had accepted a benefit.\n\n     Answer \"yes\" or \"no.''\n\n     Answer:                No\nD.

PH/\\ ·s response on page 40 asks the\n\n     Court to find tlwt \"'the Port had the express right under the Contract to issue the ·rcYise and\n\n     resubmit' response.'\" PHA 's point seems to be that it was free to ask Zachry to revise and\n\n     rcsLtbmit. but it did not order Zachry to do so nnd had no po\\ver to do so. and thcrelorc it could\n\n     not han: breached the contract by simply asking. nicely, that Zachry do                      SLl.

Zachry claims that\n\n    Pill\\ was not allowed to do so. and PIIA says it ncwr tried to. To that extent. at kast. those two\n\n    positions seem to line up in logical agreement to the Court.\n\n            The Court is unwilling to ruk. at this time. that no other pro\\·ision of the contract gave\n\n    PHA the right to prevent Zachry from conducting itsclrin a particular way. and some of the\n\n    provisions that PHA cites on pages 38 and 39 or its Response may in fact han:: allowed\n\n    something akin to at least partial rejection. The Court will have to hear more evidence                      ab~)ut\n\n\n    those proposed bases for rejection (though this is not intended to undo any prior ruling by this\n\n    Court regarding any particular clause ol'the contract). The Court                h~.:rchy   DENIES 7achr;'s\n\n    request for a determination as a matter of b\\v at this time that NO provision or the Contract gave\n\n    PI lAthe right to reject or otherwise command Zachry to conduct itself in a particular way. Even\n\n    ifno provision allowed Pll/\\ to complL.·tcly reject the frozen cutoiT\\\\:alL there may be other\n\n    pro\\·isions cited hy Pl-IA that gave PHA          th~   right to oth<.:rwisc limit/achry's conduct at the\n\n    project in whole or in part. At this point. the Court is not willing to say. as              :.1   matkr of law. that.\n\n    one or more of the provisions liskd in the boltom paragraph of page 39 of PHA ·s Response\n\n    could not bL· read tu limit Zachry's operations under the contract to some extent. The Court does\n\n    not anlrmativcly find that they do. but will not. hy a Rule 166(g) :Vlotion tind that they do not as\n\n    a matter of law prior to trial.\n\n             This is a different finding than whether or not PHA had the right under the contract to\n\n    issue a revise and resubmit (as opposed to reject) response under sections 5.22 and 5.25. The\n\n    Court dues not make such a determination as a matter of law under thi::; OrJL-r.\n\n\n\n\n    ' !his discussion lt:uvt.:s aside !he separate breach of CO-l alleged by Zachry. and focuses only on the alleged breach\nz   by Pili\\ umkr Sl.!<.'tion 5.10 (means and methods) und 5.22 {submiti<Jis) of the main contract.\n\f               Issue 4:        By this issue.

That section\n\n      provides for a live day notice period for Zachry after any interpretatiun or the Contract\n\n      Documents by any agent of PH/\\ i I' Zachry considered such an interpretation to he a change to\n\n      the contract. PHA argued that section 5.42 upplied to the claims asserted by Zachry and Zachry\n\n      argued that the section Jid not govern its claims in this lawsuit. and that the section was void\n\n      under Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.071. The Court entered an order in\n\n      March 2009 denying the .\\t1otion for Summary Judgment and tinding that PI lA was not entitled\n\n      to summary judgment because it was not clear that the section was applicahle to the facts of this\n\n      case. The Court further found that the section was void under section 16.071 iJ' it was applicable.\n\n              The hasis for not finding that the section \\vas applicable as a m:.1ttcr        or law in t\\1arch 2009\n      \\\\as that the Court felt that thL· matter was controlled hy B.

PI I/\\ argued that the Du\\'il' ( 'o. case is neither on point IK'r\n\n      controlling because it applies to a situation       wh~:r~:   the contractor could bL· required to perform\nc\n\n      changes in the \\\\'ork, and the owner could unilaterally determine any            ad.ju~tment   in the contract\n\n      price to account for such changes. Jn contm:-;1. in this case, PHA argues, the provision is merely\n\n      :.1notice pro\\·ision. not a unilateral change in the scope or quantity oJ'work provision.\n\n\n;z:\n\f            The Court did not      articulut~   this   w~ll   at the   S~ptcmher      11. 2009     h~aring,   but upon further\n\n    ret1e~tion   and re-n:ading of the Daris Cu. case. it now understands the point that PIIA was\n\n    making: PH;\\\\; point is thut the Davis Co. case's \"radicul change'' issue did not have to do vvith\n\n    whether a contractual notice period applied to a radical change in                     th~   scope of the \\Vork, but\n\n    ruther. vvhethcr the radical change could           h~   unilaterally imposed in the scope           ol\"th~   work with\n\n    littk or no change in the amount of' the           C\\H11p~nsation.    That is. the Duris C'o. case. according to\n\n    PHA. only stands lor the proposition that an owner cannot impose radically mon: work upon the\n\n    contractor for the same price. but rath~r. such unilateral prerogative clauses only apply to minor\n\n    chang1..'S to the scope or amount of work. That. argues PI l1\\. distinguishes Dul'is C'o. !\"rom thi::;\n\n    case.\n\n            The Court does not see it that way. The Court still Jinds Dm·is Co. to be applicable to\n\n    this case because the clause at issue here. section 5.42. is a roundabout way of getting to the\n\n    same place. PllA argues that         s~ction   5.42 is different than       th~   facts of Doris Co. as section 5.42\n\n    only allows ti.!r an   ~:quitablc   adjustment irthcrc is a change order, which. by ddl.nitit!n, must he\n\n    agreed to by /.achry. That is to say. in the second paragraph of section 5.42. the cbusc states\n\n    that if Zachry gin:s the notice reg11rding the perceived change                   to   the contract. the Chief\" Engineer\n\n    or PHA \\vill conduct un investigation and determine whether the change will necessitate a\n    modilicution t1.1 the contract. und if so, whether to go forward. ft: and only if, the                     Chicl'Engine~:.T\n\n\n    determines that it is a change that will require u modilication. and decides to go forward, then the\n\n    Chief' Engineer \\Viii (perhaps) issue a construction               ch~mgc   Jirecti\\'e. or recommend to the\nc\n\n    Commission      w1   equit11hlc adjustment to the Contract Price as applicable. I lowcvcr, iithe Chid\n\n    Engin~~r     detem1ines thllt thL' contractor is wrong and the change                  pcrc~iwd    by the contractor is\n\n    not actually a chang~ requiring modi ticution. the Chief [ngi neer then will contact the contr::1ctor\n\n    and ''the determination by the Chief Engineer in such respect shall be final and conclusive.\" ln\nz\n\f      other words. in th~ end. it is a unilateral          d~krminution         by PHA     wheth~::r   a change. large or small.\n\n      is a ch~mge requiring modi lication to the wntract.

That is why\n\n      the Coun believes that the Dm·is Co. case is. i r not controlling. at least persuasive. analogous\n\n      authority here. i\\ section like section 5.42 can only apply to non-radical changes. otherwise. just\n\n      as in the Da1·is C'o. case, it \\VOtild allow the owner to unilaterally change                    th~   scope of the work in\n\n      signiticm1t ways without atlording any rights               to   the contractor.-'\n\n               further. the Court continues to find that               ~:vcn   ir section 5.42 applies to this     cas~:.   it is void\n\n      under fe:-:as Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.071. PIIA argues strenuously that                                 th~:\n\n\n      Court errone-ously applied section 16.071 to this section and that the Texas                         Suprcm~    Court\"s\n\n      decision in .lmcricun ..Jirlinu.\\ l:.'mpluyeus Federal Credil Union\\' ..\\!arlin. :29 S.W.Jd 86.97-98\n\n      (TL·x. 2000) dictates thut section 5.4:2 is not void.

Further.

The Court.\n\n         having considered PHA 's Request. Plaintiffs December 10, 2009 Response, as well as PHA's\n\n         Supplement to its Request and the arguments of counsel, is of the opinion that PHA 's Request\n\n         should be DEN JED .\n\n                The issue in this Request is the application ofTe)tas Rule of Evidence 107. Underlying\n\n         the request, generally speaking, is the following aspect of this trial. Under prior rulings by this\n\n         Court, Zachry hus to prove one or more common law exceptions to the no damages for delay .\n\n         clause contained in the Wharf and Dredge contract made the basis of this suit in order to defeat\n\n         that clause. One of those common law exceptions is referred to loosely in this record as the \"bad\n\n         faith exception,'' and Zachry contends that a certain promise that PHA 's Mark Vincent allegedly\n\n         made in an internal PHA e-mail, and which PitA then allegedly breached, is evidence ofbad\n\\()\n......\n 0       faith on PllA 's part. The promise, according to Zachry. was essentially that, as of May 2005.\n\n         PI JA would not charge liquidated damages ifPHA suffered no actual losses or harms by the time\n\n         the Chinese crane ship--scheduled tor first February 2006 and later May 2006--arrivcd.\n\n                In contrast, PH A e<:mtends that if any such promise was made. it related not to the date\n\n         tor the Chinese crane ship's arrival. but to a broader, more onerous Milestone A deadline, and\n cv\n E\n ::I\n 0\n 0\nCl\n\"0\n v\nt.=\n•t:\n v\n()\n                                                                                                    : 01112\n\f                                 •                                            •\n        potentially, the fi nal completion deadline. That is. PHA 's position is that if any \"promise\" was\n\n        made regarding liquidated damages, it was thot no LOs would he charged if PI lA sutlered no\n\n        actual damages or harms 1hrouglz the Milestone A deadline or, possibly. the eventual fina l\n\n        completion date of January 2009. It was not, PHA argues (if any promise was made), limited to\n\n        the date of arrival of the Chinese crane ship arrival.\n\n               Thus, PHA 's position is that the discussion by Zachry of the alleged \"promise\" not to\n\n        charge liquidated damages at all, coupled w ith ( I) the Andy Anderson April and May 2005\n\n        letters which mention the final completion deadl ine, as well as the \"milestone'' deadl ine, and (2)\n\n        Mr. Abiasi's recent testimony about ships routinely docking at the wharf during 2006 and 2007\n\n        (and possibly later), have opened the door to the introduction of evi dence by PHA of all of the\n\n        alleged \"harms\" (actual expenses and losses) allegedly suffered by PH A. T his discussion, PHA\n\n        contends, is necessary to rebut Zachry's bad fa ith aq,rumcnt by showing that, in fact, there 1\\'ere\n\n        actual ham1s suffered by PHA.    Therefore~   the arbrumcnt continues, even if thejury believes that\n\n        the promise related to the crane ship arrival or the Milestone A deadline (which PHA argues is a\n\n        much later date), PHA did in fact suffer actual harms. Thus, PH A contends, they did not hreach\n\n        any alleged promise because they indeed lzad actual harms. Indeed, they argue, if there was any\n\n        promise, they lived up to it.\n\n                         Texas Rule of Evidence I 07 - Rule of Optional Completeness\n\n                Under the case law pertaining to TRE 107. the Court believes that the door was opened as\n\n        to the discussion of actual harms up to the date of the May IS, 1006 letter in which PH A\n\n        communicated that it would charge liquidated damages. It is logical to conclude that it was on\n0\n\\0\n00      that date, at the very latest, that PHA decided it would charge liquidated damages, and at that\n0\\\n0\n\n;       therefore, under either version of the all eged promise (whether it wa<; the date of the Chinese\n ;..;\n u\n.D\n E      crane ship arrival. or the date of Milestone A completion), it had suffered actual harms at that\n :::s\nz\ncu\n E\n :::s\n u\n 0\nCl\n-o                                                         2\n 0\nt;:;\n'€\n<3\n                                                                                                  ~ 01113\n\f                              •                                                    •\ntime, or reasonably anticipated such actual harms to necessarily flow from the alleged delay.\n\nOtherwise, it would not have decided to charge liquidated damages at that time in light of either\n\nalleged version of the alleged promise (if there was uny promise at all).\n\n         Given this, the Court believes that the discussion of (I) the Andy Anderson letters of the\n\nSpring of2005. and (2) Mr. Vincent's e-mail as the basis of the alleged promise not to charge\n\nliquidated damages, and (3) Mr. Abiasi's discussion of the ships arriving rc&'Ularly after the\n\nChinese crane ship· .s arrival, is the same subject matter as PI!A· s alleged hann.s that were both\n\nactually incurred, and reasonably expected to be incurred as of the date it sent the May 15. 2006\n\nletter charging liquidated damages.

Thus, the test under TRE I 07 would seem to he .satisfied. 1\n\n         1t is important to note that in response to the Court's earlier \"open-the-door\" oral ruling,\n\nin which the Court stated that Zachry had opened the dollr allowing PHA to discuss evidence of\n\n\"any harms that occurred up to the date of the crane ship arrival,\" PHA stated that it had no\n\ndollar amounts of any harms it had actuall y sutlcrcd as of the date that the Chinese crane ship\n\nhad arrived. Very recently, however, PHA hegan to ar&'UC that while it had not suffered out of\n\n\n\n1\n   fun hcr. thflugh PHA 's counsel has pointed out thai this rea:>oning docs not seem 10 underpin C3Sl' law pertaining\nto TRE 107 (but rather, it applies to case law regarding trial by cons~nt). it is worth noting that the eviden~e of the:\n:;hips r~gularly arriving at th~ wharf during the ongoing con!'truction that Zachry adduced through Mr. Abiasi is\nrdcvant to rebut PI! A's allegation that Zachry took far too long to complete its work. Zachry says th!! cvidem:~ of\nships arriving during construction, and Zachry's accommodation of those arriving ships. explains some llr ollllf the\ndelays. Thus, 10 be fair, the cvidcnvc was aT!,'Uably not adduced Ill show that Pl lA sufTcrcd no hanns because ships\ncould arri\\'C at the wharf. Rather, it was adduced, in Zachry'!\\ view, to c.1tplain the delays of which it was accused hy\nPllA. So therefore, argues Zachry. it did not really OJXn the door because the cvidc:ncc: has rt:le\\o·anc<: 10 somtthing\nother than PHA 's alleged ha rms. PHA nonetheless argues that it do'<s not matter why it was introduced, out that the\nonly consideration is the jury's potential misapprchen:>ion.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                          =01114\n\f                                •                                              •\n       pocket losses or harms as of the date of the Chinese crane ship's arrival, it knew at that time that\n\n       it would necessarily suffer actual harms that would actually be incurred after that date. Why\n\n       PHA did not ask tor clarification of the Court's oral ruling to determine whether anticipated\n\n       harms ofwhicb it was aware as ofthc ~ate of the Chinese crane ship arrival date were included\n\n       in that ruling is unclear. Nevertheless, it is possible there is evidence of reasonably anticipated\n\n       actual harms of which PHA was aware as of the May 15, 2006 letter charging liquidated\n\n       damages. The Court has not heard this evidence as of the date ofthis Order.\n\n              To be clear, however, the Court believes that the door has only been opened to a dc1,rree.\n\n       It has onJy been opened to the extent that, if the Court were to allow the evidence to come in, it\n\n       would only do so to the point where PHA could discuss discrete categories of actual harms.\n\n       However, the Court would not al low PHA to discuss the specitic dollar amounts or quantities of\n\n       those alleged harms. Eliciting evidence of the types or categories or actual harms, the Court\n\n       believes. would allow PHA to correct any misimprcssion held by the jury that PHA suffered no\n\n       actual harms which would underlie or support its May 15, 2006 decision to charge liquidated\n\n       dum ages. There is no need to go the additional step of discussing the actual amounts of those\n\n       alleged harms.\n\n                                           Texas Rule of Evidence 403\n\n              Now, despite having opened the door to the discussion of the actual harms either actually\n\n       incurred as of the date of the May 15, 2006 liquidated damages letter, or those reasonably\n\n       anticipated as of that date which necessarily would have flowed from the alleged delays up to\n\n       that date, the Court believes the evidence should nevertheless be excluded under Texas Rule of\n0\n\\0\n00\n       Evidence 403. Zachry has also expressly objected to this evidence on Rule 403 grounds.\n0\\\n0\n\n~             First, the Court~ at the outset of the. trial. ruled that other than 3 specitic categories of\n ;_:\n Q)\n.D\n E     actual harms, because of late or no-supplementation of discovery, PITA would not be permitted\n ~\n;z:\ncQ)\n E\n ~\n 0\n 0\na                                                         4\n13\nt.::\n·t:\n Q)\nu\n                                                                                                   : Ol111~\n\f                            •                                           •\nto discuss 8 to 10 million dollars worth of alleged actual harms. Without modifying that ruling,\n\nthe main   rcas~m   for that decision was that the Court did not want to-at the last minute--\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the trial by adding many days or weeks of testimony about\n\nwhether those alleged harms were actually suffered, and in what amounts. Moreover, the Court\n\ndid not want to disrupt the trial by having the parties have to undertake substantial amounts of\n\ndiscovery in the middle of what already promised to be a lengthy trial. At bottom. it would have\n\nbeen unfair to inject all of that evidence of about $1 0 million worth of an offset claim by PHA\n\ninto the trial at the last moment. The Court does not believe that there is any basis to change that\n\nruling.\n\n          Second, undc=r Rule 403 , the Court believes that any probative value of injecting al l of the\n\nevidence of alleged hanns into the trial would be substantially outweighed by the danger of (I)\n\nunfair prejudice to Zachry, and (2) considerations of undue delay. In particular, not only would\n\nit take a lot of time for the information to be elicited in the tirst place from a PHA witness. it\n\nwould necessarily require a lengthy cross-examination. That cross-examination could very\n\nquickly devolve into a lcnhrthy battle over not only the nature of the alleged harms, but their\n\ncause and quantitication. As stated above, the reason this information was kept out in the first\n\nplace was because of dcticicncics in PI iA 's discovery responses. For Zachry to then have to\n\ncross-examine on this issue when it has not had a chance w conduct discovery ot' any\n\nsignificance on these issues would certainly be highly prejudicial. And, all of this testimony\n\nwould take a lot of time·- we are now in the 8111 week of testimony in this trial as of this writing.\n\n          Texas Rule of Evidence I 07 is subject to Rule 403.

Plaintiff Zachry is a DelmvaJe corporation, ·with its principal place of business in\n\nSan Antonio, Bexar County, Texas.\n\n       2.      Def'endant PHA is a Texas novigation district established under i\\rticle XVI,\n\nSection 59 of the Texas Constitution, with its prim:,ipal place of business in Houston, Harris\n\nCounty, Texas. Defendant PHA has appeared .in this lawsuit and may be served through its\n\n\n                                                    1\n\fcounsel of recordt David H.

Venue is proper in this Court as Harris County is the county \"in which all or\n\nsubstantial part of the events ... giving rise to (this] claim occutred.'' TEX. Ctv. PRAC. &REM.\n\nCor>t~    ANN. § 15.002(a)(l). Venue is also proper as Harris County is the county of PHA's\n\n\"principal office in this state.''   TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §       15,002(a)(3). Finally,\n\nvenue is proper in this Court because Harris County is the county in which the parties have\n\n\"contracted in writing to perform. an oblfgation,H expressly naming Harris County in that 'Nriting.\n\nTt::X.

Jurisdiction is proper in this Court as the amount in controversy is in excess of the\n\nminimal judsdictional requirements of this Court. Further, this Conrl has personal jurisdictitm\n\nover Defendant as it is a Texas navigation district located in Harris County. Texas.\n\n          5.     This court has jurisdiction over this suit against PHA because the Texas\n\nlegislature has waived sovereign immunity from suit \\vhh respect to breach of contract claim!l\n\nagainst navigation districts such as PHA. TEx. Lac, Gov;T CODE ANN. § 271.151, et seq.\n\nFurther, it is well settled that when the State or a political subdivision contracts with private\n\ncitizens~   as PHA has done, it waives sovereign immunity from liability. See Tooke v, Ciiy of\n\n\n\n                                                   2\n\flvfexlat 197 S.W.3d 32:5,332 (Tex. 2006); Gen. Servs. Comm 'n v, Little~1ex. Insulation Co., Inc.•\n\n39 S. \\VJd 591, 594 (Tex. 2001). Tl1is suit involves claims for PHA's breach of a written\n\ncontract within the Textis Legislature 1 s express waiver of sovereign immunity. TEX. Loc. Gov'T\n\nCODE ANN. § 271.1        Bayport Phase l A Wharf and Dredging Contract (H\\l·/h.arf and Dredge\n\nContract\").1 Based on !he facts alleged below, Zachry seeks to recover damages under §§\n\n27L153(a)(1) and (a)(2) of the Texas Local Government Code. Accordingly, PHA may not\n\nassert sovereign immuni.ty from suit or from liability with respect to the claims asserted herein.\n\n\n\n       6.      On or about June 1, 2004, af\\er soliciting proposals and awarding the project to\n\nZachry, PHA and Zachry executed the \\Vharf and Dredge Contract Pursuant to the written\n\n\\Vharf and Dredge Contract, Zachry was to construct a J 660...:foot wharf facility in Pasadena,\n\nTt:xas. Under the original terms of the Wharf and Dr<:dge Contruct, construction \\Vas to be\n\ncompleted by June 1, 2006, ln addition, by February l, 2006, Zachry wa.') to meet an intertm\n\ndeadline by which a portion of the wharf PHA had designated {\"Milestone A\") would be\n\nsufficiently completed supposedly to allow the delivery of certain large ship~teH;hore cranes that\n\n\\Vere to be delivered by ship from China.\n\n       7.      Shortly thereafter, Zachry began construction of the wharf: At the     outset~   and as\n\nPHA understood before it awarded Zachry the contract) Zachry's chosen construction\n\nmethodology and construction plans involved the construction of a temporary frozen shoring\n\n\n\n       1\n          Because the Wharf and Dredge Contract is too volurninous to physically attach to this\npetition, Zachry hereby expressly incorporates by reference the copy of the Wharf and Dredge\nContract filed hy Defendant PHA as .Exh.ibit B to its Plea to the Jurisdiction and to Hs First\nSpecial Exceptions.\n\n                                                 3\n\fwall {a \"'freeze wall'') al<mg the ch;mnel side of the wharf,         The   freeze~wall   construction\n\nmethodology involved building a large berm along the channel side of the wharf, placing pipes\n\ninto the berm, circu!at1ng a sub-iteezing brine solution through the pipes, and freezing the.\n\nearthen berm into a frozen soil mass or walL The resulth1g freeze wall would allow Zachry to\n\nexcavate the earth between the channel and the fmthcoming \\Vharf, under the wharf deck, and\n\namong the wharf's piers in dry conditions without having to resort to more difficult and more\n\ncostly mechanical dredging and \"'vet\" excavation techniqt1es. Based upon this known plan,\n\nZachry proceeded to build the earthen berm, gather and place the pipes necessary to crea.tc the\n\nfreeze wall into the berm, drive support piles, and generally work toward fulfilling its contractual\n\nobligations by executing its construction n1e1hodology.\n\n       8.      In or before March 2:005, because     Pl1A~s   contractual design underestimated the\n\nwharf length nec:essaq to meet its own wharf demand, PHA notified Zachry that it needed to\n\nincrease the size ofthe \\VharfZachry \\Vas then building. PHA's original wharf design (for which\n\nPHA had contracted vvith Zachry to build and which Zachry was building at the time) was not\n\nlong enough to accommodale the volume and/or type of ship traffic that was expected to call at\n\nBayport upon the fac-ility's opening. 2 .Due to its o\\vn error) PHA requested that Zachry submit a\n\nproposal to construct a longer wharf than the one for \\Vhi.ch the parties had originally contracted\n\nin the Wharf and Dredge Contract. Specifically, PHA requested that Zachry provide a proposal\n\nto add an additional 332 feet in length of wharf to the existing design, thereby substantially\n\nincreasing the siG:e of the wharf and !.he amount of remaining work. ln addltiont because PBA\n\n\n\n       2\n        The determination ofthe wharflength for which the Port c011tractcd in the original\nWharf & Dredge Contract was u rnalter solely wiihin PHA's control.\n\n                                                 4\n\fhad also underestimated the size of the Chinese     crane~delivery   ship, PHA also later requested a\n\nsubstantial increase in the size of Milestone A so that the cranes used to operate the facility could\n\nbe docked and unloaded?\n\n         9.       PHA1 :s immediate need for an additional 332-foot section of wharf required\n\nZachry to re\\vork its construction methodology. In early April 2005: in response to PHNs\n\nsolicitation of Zachry for a proposal to perform the additional work PHA needed, Zachry\n\ndescribed to PHA the construction methodology modification that it would need to perfom1 the\n\nwork. Specifically, PHA's new design necessitated a critical modification to Zachry's freeze\n\nwall construction methodology,\"·,,the addition of a freeze \\Vall that would run perpendicular to lhe\n\noriginal freeze \\Vall (the perpendicular \\vall being referred to herein as the 11 frozen cutoff wall\"),\n\nTl1e frozen cutoff waH was needed so that Zuch1y could similltuneously accomplish three main\n\nobj~;;ctives;   (l) completing Milestone A on time; (2) allowing the Chinese ship carrying the\n\ncranes to dock 1 unload, and depart; and, critically (3) maintaining the remainder of the wharf\n\n(i.e,, the non~Mllestone A portion of the wharf) i.n the dry so that Zachry's construction\n\nmethodology could continue to be irnplemented. On April 13, 2005, Zachry provided a written\n\npropostll to perfom1 the a.dditio1ia:l work PHA needed for      a certain price,   Zachry's price \\\\'as\n\nexpressly conditioned on Zachry's \"[u]se of a freeze wall-cutoff wall, encompassing one (1) 'B'\n\nrowpiling,\" which \\Vas exactly \\vhat Zachry had previously described to PHA.\n\n         10.      In August 2005, PHA, informed Zachry that it intended to issue a change order\n\nauthorizing the additional work PHA had requested,           Ftowcverl   PHA~-\\vhHe     continuing to\n\n\n\n        3\n         The designation ofthe length of the Milestone A portion of the \\Vharfwas a matter\nsolely Within PHA's controL\n\n\n                                                  5\n\frequest that Zachry cr.mstruct the iiddhional wharf section·~simultaneously informed Zachry that\n\nuntil it issued that change order, Zachry would proceed at its      O\\Vtl    risk . On or about September\n\n12. 2005, at Pl·IA's request. Zachry presented PHA with a detailed design of the frozen cutoff\n\n\\'Vall that Zachry planned to use in connection with the c.bange order work as provided under ils\n\nproposal. That design was consistent with Zachry's prior description of the frozen cutoff walt\n\n          11.      On September 27, 2005, two weeks after Zachry had provided its frozen cmoff\n\n\\Vall design, PHA executed Change Order Nurnber 4. ofl1cially agreeing that Zachry was to\n\npertbrm the additional work under the terms set forth in Zachry's proposal, unless otherwise\n\nspecified in the modifications to the April 13 proposal that were made in the change order.\n\nChange Order 4 never rnodified Zachry's April 13 proposal            tt'l   exclude the use of the frozen\n\ncutoff wall and, thus. the frozen cutoff wall was approved. in Change Order Number 4. Change\n\nOrder Number 4 clearly and expressly contemplated the use of the frozen cutoff wall design in\n\nthe C(m1pletion of the \\Vharf-indecd, it was the explicit basis for the negotiation of pricing and\n\nscheduling under Change Order Number 4. But just two weeks after executing Change Order\n\nNumber 4, PHA changed course and precluded Zachry from implementing its proposed,\n\ncontracruaJJy approved frozen cutoffwall design. PHA rejected that design. 4\n\n          12,      PHA's rejection of Zachry~s trozen cuwtf walL which actively interfered with\n\nZachry's      \\VOrk,   was done in bad ta.ith, arbitrarily, capriciously, and without any legitimate or\n\nreasm1ahle bash~. 5 Moreover; despite recognizing this immediately as a geotechnical problem,\n\n\n          4\n              Stated another way. PHA impermissibly precluded Zachry from implementing the\ndesign.\n          5\n              PHA' s bad faith, arbitrary, and capricious conduct, which interfered with Zachri s\n\\Vork, is described in greater detail in Zachry's discovery responses.\n\n\n                                                      6\n\fPHA did not bother to engage its gedtechnicaJ engineer, GeoTest> until after PHA had rejected\n\nthe frozen cutoff walL Moreover, nothing in GeoTest's report would support a rejection of the\n\nfrozen cutoff wall. 1n addition, PHA's own Chief Engineer, who had the ultimate responsibility\n\nat PHA for resolving all engineering questions on the project, admitted that PHA did not have\n\nenough infom1ation to judge whether or not the freeze wall violated the standard of care. He also\n\nadmitted that no one at PHA had concluded that there would be an adverse impact or that the\n\ncutoff wall design in any way violated the standard of care. Further demonstrating the Port's bad\n\nfaith, arbitrary, and capricious conduct regarding the rejection, Zachry's freeze wan          experts~\n\nGeoEngineers, provided additional research demonstrating that there was no adverse affec.t to\n\nfreezing the :soil around the drilled shafts. Consistent with the freeze \\Vall expert's opinions at the\n\ntime, PllA's Construction Manager, CH2MHILL, provided the frozen cutoff wall design to its\n\nown in-bouse geoteclmicaJ engineering experts, who returned comments confirming that the\n\nproposed frozen cutoff \\Vall design did not pose any issue. PHA's own expert .in this lawsuit has\n\nlikewise testified that the frozen cutoff wall was a viable and safe design and that he had no basis\n\nto believe it would have any negative impact on the structure.\n\n        13.     Another example of the Port's bad faith,    arbitrary~   and. capricious conduct is the\n\nfact that PHA expressly charged and designated its Construction Manager, CH2MHILL, to act\n\non its behalf on this critical cutoff wall issue despite the fact that PHA knew and understood that\n\nCH2MH1LL had a poor record and was HI-equipped to deal with such an issue. Indeed, PHA had\n\npreviously admitted that CH2MHLL responded to project and design issues in a ''CYA\"' mode\n\nrather than appropriately addressing the issues. This CYA approach was evidenced again when\n\neven after identifying any issues concerning freezing as geotedmical h1 nature, even after\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  i.\n\freceiving CH2MHILL's senior geotechnical engineering experts' opinions stating they did not\n\nsee a problem, and even after receiving Zachry's freeze waH expert's           follow~up   analysis   re~\n\nconfinning there was not a problem CH2MH1LL·-PHA 's designated agent on this cutoff wall\n\nissue--communicated several problems from a \"structural engineering perspective,\" none of\n\nwhich were viable concerns, none of which were assessed prior to the Port's rejection> and all of\n\nwhich were simply designed to divert any potential liability from CH2MHfLL. On October\n\nlO~espite    the unanimous approval from freeze wall experts on both. sides and notwithstanding\n\nthe fact th<\\t PHA had not even hired its own geotechnical engineer to look at this issue (much\n\nless nx:cived the result of any such review), PHA rejected the fq.:cze, walL\n\n       14.      PHA 's reJection of the frozen cutoff wall constituted a breach of both Change\n\nOrder 4 and the General Conditions of the Wharf & Dredge Contract. 6 Notwithstanding PHNs\n\n\"'bail and switch\" tac:tics·-including PHA 1 s delay in approving Change Order Number 4 and\n\nsubsequent improper   r~jection   of the frozen cutoff wall methodology stated 1n Change Order\n\nNumber 4--PHA remarkably continued to insist that Zachry complete the expanded project\n\nvtithin the parameters set forth in Change Order Number 4.\n\n       15.     Moreover, when it executed Change Order 4, PHI\\. had no present intent to>\n\nperform its requirement that Zachry be permitted the right to use the frozen cutoff wall. Texas\n\nlaw clearly provides that when one enters into an agreement that it has no present intent to\n\nperfonn, this constitutes fraud. Here, on September 27, 2005 PHA executed a contract that\n\npe1mitted Zachry to use the frozen cutoff waiL PHA induced Zachry to agree this contract at a\n\n\n       6\n         Alternatively, to the extent PHA contends that it only require<;l Zachry to ''revise and\nresubmit\" its frozen cutoff\\vall design, such conduct also constituted a breach of Change Order\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fprice and schedule based on a particular frozen cutoff wall design. PHA then rejected the very\n\ndesig11 that formed the basis for the contract only days after signing the agreement because it\n\nnever intended to allmv Zadrry to use the fi•ozen cutoff wall. To this day PHA denies that it ever\n                                                                                           7\nintended to approve Zachry's use the frozen cutoffv•tall \\Vhen executing Change Order 4.\n\n        16,     Zachry, unable to implement the agreed-upon frozen cutoff wall construction\n\nmethod due to PHA 's conduct, found itself short on thne because the work needed to be\n\ncompleted under the freeze. \\vall approach 1 the Port had precluded the use of that approach, and\n\nthere was a crane ship that was to arrive frnm China in the near f\\rture. Thus, after a review of\n\nthe alternative proposed solutions) Zachry ultimately decided it would have to forego the entire\n\nfreeze-wall construction method in order to prepare the wharf in a rnanner that would allow the\n\nChinese crane ships to dock and unload. Zachry therefore was forced in large part to complete.\n\nthe wharf using unanticipated \"'wet'' excavation techniques.       hl doing so, Zachry incurred\n\nsubstantial additional costs. The completion of interim Milestone A and the entire project was\n\ndelayed as a result, as well.\n\n        17.     Even though the delays were caused by PHA's breach of the Wharf ar1d Dredge\n\nContract, PHA has withheld and threatens to further withhold liquidated daxnages based on an\n\nunenforceable penalty provision in the contract. First, because the purported liquidated damages\n\nprovision attempts to enforce liquidated damages vvhilc simultaneously allowing (and, indeed\n\ncalling tor) the recovery of actual damages, it is void as a matter of Texas law. Second, the\n\nliquidated damages provision is unenforceable because PHA suffered no harm. Third, the\n\n\nNumber 4 and the General Conditions of the Contract\n\n        i PHA's bad-faith, fraudulent; arbitrary, and capricious conduct tKtively interfered with\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fliquidated damages provision is unenforceable because Zachry's compliance with the contractual\n\ndeadlines \\Vas precluded by PHA's own errors and misconduct.\n\n        18.     By its conduct, PITA has breached the Wharf and Dredge Contract in several\n\nrespects.     Jn particular by precluding Zachry lrom implementing its frozen cutoff wall\n\nconstntction methodology and ultimately the entire freeze wall construction methodology, PHA\n\nhas breached Change Order 4 and Section 5. l 0 of the Wharf and Dredge Contract. See Change\n\nOrder Number 4 to Wharf and Dredge Contract; Wharf and Dredge Contract 11 5.10. PHA has\n\nfurthet breached the Wharf and Dredge Contract by \\vrongful!y witltholding as \"liquidated\n\ndamages'' sltms nthenvise due Zachry under the Wl1r1rf & Dredge Coutntct pursuant to an\n\nunenforceable penalty clause and for time overruns that were themselves caused by PHA's\n\nconduct. See Wharf and Dredge Contract, 1j 5.05, ~. 5.06, Addendum No.8 (lll·15) (purporting to\n\nprovide PHA the right to recover liquidated damag.es as a dttmage \"f1oor,\" while also purporting\n\nto allow recovery of actual damages if they exceed the          liq\\tidated~damages   amount).

In addition, PH;\\ has a!sQ vmmgly withheld\n\napproximately    $600~000   from Zachry upder a purpo11ed claim of offset, PHA has no :right to\n\noff.,et these damages under the Contract and is wrongflllly \\Vlthholding !his $600,000 which Js\n\ndue and owed to Zachry as part of the Contract price in further breach ofthe Contract See Wharf\n\nand Dredge Contrnct at pages        1-i\\ ~~i 6.02, 6.05, and 6.!7.

The conset1uences of PHA 's misconduct have caused Zachry significant damage,\n\nPHA 's bad faith conduct, at its core, derives from PHA 's bmTmucratic mentality, incompetence,\n\nand desire to punish Zachry for asserting its legal rights. This is evidencc,d by, in addition to the\n\nmatters pleaded above, PH A's racking up of excessive, unreasonable, and urmecessary legal fees\n\nas a means of attempting to mtinufactuni a meritless cmmterc1aim, delay the payment of it.s\n\nobligations under the \\Vharf & Dredging Contractj and avoid the payment of its debt by spending\n\nZachry into submission. PHA 's bad faith pauem ofconduct has persisted up until the present,\n\nincluding PFIA's rec.ent additional bad faith steps at the end of the project done in order ro\n\nsqueeze its contractor. This bad faith conduct includes PHA 's apparent decision to stop pS.)'ing\n\nZachry's invoices {including .invoice Number 39), PHNs failure to declare that the status of\n\nZachry's \\vork under the 'A'harf & Dredge contract is complete despite (11) that fact that it is\n\ncomplete, and (b) its contractual obligation to determine the status of the Work, and PHA 1 s\n\ntallurc to permit an assignment of the contract without a legitimate basis to the affiliated Zachry\n\n\n\nof the Contract Docurnents. n ld. at 2.

The Wharf\n\nand Dredge Contract, including vvithout limitation all Change Orders and Addenda to the Wharf\n\nand Dredge Contract, is a legally binding \\Witten agreement within the meaning of Texas Local\n\nGovernment Code Section 271.152.         Zachry has performed and continues to perfom1 its\n\nobligations under the Wharf and Dredge Contract, or alternatively, was prevented from\n\nperforming certain obligations by PHA's material breach of contract.          Zachry has met all\n\nconditions precedent to recovery. 10 As detailed above, the Wharf and Dredge Contract l1as not\n\n\n       9\n            On December lZ, 2007, Zachry notified PHA that the remaining work on the project\n(as of January 1, 2008) would be completed by the same personnel) but thatthe personnel \\Vould\nbe employed by a sister Zachry affitiate due to a Zachry corporate reorganization. On. January\n181 2008, PHA indicated that lt was \"prepared to approve such assignment\" to Lhe Zachry\naffiliate that finished the project work as of January 1, 20081 but under certain conditions. Ghien\nPHA' s lack of consent to the assignment, Zachry did not assign the contract. Instead, it\ncompleted the project as it had described to PHA in December 2007. On April 7, 2009. with the\nconditions PHA previously stated satisfied by the cm11pletion of the \\York and/or by additional\nZachry assurances provided, Zachry again requested the assignment of the Cm1tract; PHA has\nnot responded and, thus, not pennitted the Contract's assignment. Accordinglyt given PHA's\nrecent bad faith conduct with regard to its lack of consent to assignment and in an abundance of\ncaution, Zachry has entered into a pass~through agreement with its af11liate. Under that\nagreement, Zachry would be entitled to recover the darnages incurred by and through its anlliate\n(approximately $8,5.78,712 of the damages alleged by Zachry) because Zachry would be liable to\nits aniliate for damages sustained by the subcontractor pursuant to the pass~tlu·ough agreement.\nSee Interstate Contracting Corp. v.

Pursuant to Rule 92 of the Texas R11lcs of Civil Procedure, the P<lrt Authority\n\ngcneraliy denies the allegations of Plaintiff Zachry Gonstructit)ll Corporation (HZachryll).\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     EXHIBIT\n\f                                STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n        3,     The Port Authority is charged with mvning, building, and operating tho publically\n\nowm.:d portions of the Port of Houston. Among the lund owned and operated by the Port\n\nAuthority is the vast Bayport Tenninal Complex    (\"Bayport~').   tn 1998, the Port Authority began\n\ndeveloping a master plan for Bayport that includes some 7)000 linear feet of wharf, modern shlp·\n\nto-shon:1 oranes for mpid loading and unloading of cargo~ 380 acres of container yards) and a\n\ncruise terminal. These facilities are being developed over timej with the design and timing of\n\neach phm;e tlctom1ined by market demand, availability of funds 1 and environn:tt.mtfll permitting\n\nlimitations.\n\n       4.      By 2003, the Port Authority was ready to begin building what is latown as Phase\n\nlA ofBayport, which lndudtxll,660 linear feet ofwhar( dredging~ an adjoining container ;'atd,\n\nand rclatt!d facilities. 'I'he engineeriog design called for the wharf to be supported by more than\n\nI ,100 concrete piers drilled to various depths (some to u depth of 120' below sealevel).\n\n        5.     The Port Authority solicited competitiv<l     set~ted   proposals for the contract\n\nZachry, while not the low proposer, Sllbmitted a proposal wilh scvcnd attractive features.   Thes<:.~\n\nim::luded 1 most prominently, Zuchrts proposal to build the wharf by using unconventional\n\nmeans by first drilling the piers and installing the wharf deck on <ky la.nd and then excavating\n\nunder the wharf deck and among the piers \"in the dry, 1'\n\n       6.      Znclwy proposed to create the dry environment for ils work beneath the wlmrf\n\ndook by usc of a freeze walL Tho freeze wall would be created by installing a network of\n\nhundreds of''itooze pipes\" in an earthen berm or cofferdmn along tho wharrs entire channclsidc\n\nlenglh. Zachry would then circulate sub~ freezing brine through the freeze pipes, ceeat1ng a wall\n\nof frozen soil strong enough to stand without other structural support ami strong enough to hold\n\fback the bay water while Zachry excavated beneath the wharf deck and around the wharf.\n\nZachry did not propose to use a freeze wall on the land side of the excavation; it planned to use\n\nconventional dewatering techniques to deal \\Yith groundwater infiltration from !he land side.\n\nOnce the excavation was complete; Zachry would remove the freeze pipes, thaw and breach the\n\nwall to admit the bay waters 1 and clred ge away the soil.\n\n        7.      Zaclu·y's freeze wall proposal offered the Port Authority a creative way in which\n\nto meet federal standards regarding emissions of nitrogen oxides. ln seeking the award of the\n\ncontrm:;t1 Zachry made other representations that were attractive to the Port Authority. Zachry\n\npledged to involve Rnmll businesll enteq)dses in the project and to work with the Port Authority\n\nin a cooperative spirit. lt tonted itselfas a large and expetienced construction company that had\n\nsuccessfully undertaken other Jlovel and cotnplex projects, and represetited that would undertillte\n\nappropriate due diligence to detr.:11:nine how to capably und compe~ently prosecute the Phase lA\n\nwork. It promised that it would place in      cl1t-~rge   of the Phase lA project the experlencud senior\n\nmanagt!r who had taken the lead in presenting Zachry's proposal to the J>()).'t Authority.        Zachry\n\nassured tho Port Authority thatthe Port could rely on Zachry as a team          player~   and that Zachry\n\nwould work with the Port in a struightl'orward manner and not engage in any \"claims game.\"\n\n        8.      Regrettably, all of these representations, on which the Port Authority relied,\n\nproved to be    untruE~;   At the   time~   however, persuaded by these representations, the Port\n\nAuthority entered into negotiations with Zachry which culminated in the Phase !A Wharf and\n\nDredging Contract dated Jm1e J, 2004 (the \".(;Qptract\"). Early In !he Project and in response to\n\nthe Port Authority's concerns regarding freez;ing the soil, Zachry a1>surcd the Port that the\n\nfh:ezing would remain far enough awuy from lhe piers that it \\Vould not compromise the \\vharf's\n\nstructural integrity. The Port Aulhodty's concern was well justified; the drllled piers' abillty to\n\fbear weight comes mostly from \"skin friction\" at the itttorface of the soil and pier down the\n\nlength of tim pier~ Freezing tl1e earth near the piers could decrease their load-bearing capacity.\n\nIn addition, the expanded volume of the soil from fn:>eidng could even move, bend, or bret~k the\n\npiers. Zachry, which had a contractual duty to protect the cmnpletcd portions of the wharf\n\ns!ruch1rc while it wus prosecuting its work, promised thut it would maintain at least nine feet\n\nbtSlWt1Cn the frozen soil amlthl;l:;urface of the piers.\n\n        \\1.     The Contract Included two crucial deadlines n.nd stipuli:lled !hat time was of the\n\nessem~e   regarding perforrnance of the Work, The iin~t was Pobmary l, 2006 (u date defined in\n\ntho Contract as thn \"Milestone A\"       date)~   by which Zachry agreed to have one portion of the\n\nwharf fully completed, Tile Port Authority needed that portion of U1e wharf completed by the\n\nMilestone A dnte so that four huge cran<'.S, which were being fabdcated in China and wert} to\n\nardve ln Houston by ship, could be de!lvered and assembled, and rben the cnme operators tndned\n\non the crnncs, in time tbr the completion of the remainder of the wlmrf. The se(.:ond was the\n\n''I1inal Conlplction\" date of June I, 2006. by which the wharf fnoilities nnd dredging work were\n\nto be completely finished,\n\n        10.     At the outset, Zachry fell behind schedule. Among other things, il was late in\n\nmobilizing its on-site work force, submitting its concrcle mix formu!atlon 1 and preparing its\n\nccmcrele butch plant     Th~;t   ::;tart of both ctmcrclc work and the freeze wall   inslallt~tion   were\n\nsignificantly delayed. Further, there was a series of blunders involving the freeze walL Most          or\nthe blunders have their origin in the character and decisions of Zachry's construction manager,\n\nHarold (Andy) Anderson.\n\n          IL    Anderson     wa~   not even a Zachry employee when the Contract was signed.\n\nZnt;hry hired him several weeks later, nftcr a short and hasty search. Although the freeze wall\n\n                                                     4\n\fwus a cen!tn'!)lece of Zachry~s constmction phm, Anderson did not want to use it Rather than\n\nimmediately lnoving forwnrd with the freeze waH, he spem months fi:ultlessly searching for an\n\nnltcmative1 putting the freeze wan behind schedule. He even delayed entering into a subcontract\n\nwith the freeze wall subcontractor whom Zachry had chosen \"\" RKK SoilFreeze Technologies\n\n(\"RKK\"). lnde<:xl 1 Za<~hry .fitially signed the RKK subcontract) and thus freed RKK lo submit a\n\nfi·cezc wall design, only after the date on which Znchty had l>larmed to hove the freeze wall\n\ncompletely installed,\n\n        12.     Anderson compounded his mistakes and delays by compromising Zachry's ability\n\nto properly pcrfonn the freeze wall .installation. F'or example, RKK had spent a substantial\n\namo1n'tt of time working with Fanner Foundation, Zachry's drilling Stlboontractor which was to\n\ninstall both the J)iers and the freeze pipes, to assurttthat Fanner Foundation was acquainted witl1\n\nthe ptt.>eise teehniqua't and tolerunces necessary in plndne, and installing freeze pipes. After all\n\nthis prepumtion work1 Anderson gave the tusk of installing tho freeze pipe to another, cheaper\n\nsub<mntractor. 'l11c replacement subcontractor's wurk was abysmal; it seldom drilled the pipe in\n\nthe location or at the angles specit1ed, and as a consequence the freeze wall design had to be\n\namended to include additional freeze plpt::s to fill in nU!iler011S gar)s. ln another ill,.;arlvised cost\n\nsaving effort, Anderson bought used and dirty freeze pipe inslead of new pipe. Ultimately, after\n\nmuch lime was wasted, approximately 70% of the used pipe was determined to be defective, and\n\nhnd to be replaced,\n\n        13,     In Febmary of 2005 1 havlng concluded that Zachry was behind schedule and in\n\ndanger <>f being unable to satisfy the Mile.'itone A obligation (but having failed to so advise the\n\nPort Authority), Anderson began planning to use a \"cut·off \\VIlli\" running perpendicular from the\n\nfrliez() wall to the land, Under his plan, Zachry would attempt to divid\\fi the pmjeGt in two,. If\n\fwould first excavate beneath the wharf on one side of the cut-off walt, and n:tter so excavating\n\nwould breach the main freeze wall on i'hat side so the ship carrying the cranes COtt!d dock and\n\nunload. Tl1cn 1 Zachry would excavate on the: other side of the cut-off wall to complete the\n\nremnimler ofit!l work.\n\n        14.    Several weeks after Zachry determined that it likely would need a cut~offwall, the\n\nPort Authority advised Zachry that the Pm·t was considering extending the w1mrf's length by 332\n\nfoot Zachry appreciated that the extension would not m.erely be u v.alunble piece of work~ but\n\nalso would offer an opportunfty tu hlivc the Port Authority pay for whatever cut~off wall Zachr)'\n\nultimately would build. Zacl)ry urged the Port Authority not to J)Ut the wharf extension oul Lor\n\nproposals by other conlracwrs, but instead to add the worl<' lo Zaclu·y's Contract. Although it\n\nknJ.>'<V better, Zachry assured the Port that it was on schedule under the 0xisting Contract and\n\ncould build the whttrf extension and still moot. tho Milestone A date.\n\n       15.     On April 5, 2005; Anderson briotly explained a concept !br a cut'-off wall nt n\n\nmeeting with the Port Authority's consultants. He promised that Zachry would soon furnish the\n\nPort Authority with a proposed design forth<:: cut¥ofr \\Vall. Aware of the Port's concem about\n\nlrcozing ncar piers, he promised that freezing was not an issue,\n\n        16.    Atlcr several months of ncgoti ations; dtlring which Zachry continued to provide\n\nthe Port Authority with inaccurate schedules and to give other assurances thai it remained on\n\nschedule1 the parties agreed on the terms of t11e \\vhmf exteusion work ln Change Order 4 to the\n\nContract. The change order, which added approximately SB million to the Contmct price and\n\nextended tim Milestone A date by 15 days~ was approved by the Port Commission in lme July of\n\n2005. The l'ort At1thority prepared the    ~.:hange   ordcw paperwotk .and delivered it to Zachry on\nAugt\\st I0. By then, Zachry already had authorized its       sub(~ontractors   to begin working on the\n\n                                                  6\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                               r~         11\n                                                                                               ...:::..   ....:4.\n\fextension. Zachry held the cbange order for several weeks ;,vhile it tried to negotiate added\n\nbenefits under the change order. Finally,; on August 29, 2005; Zachry delivered the signed\n\nchange order to the Port A:Uihority.\n\n         11.       lAter, on or about September 12, 2005, Zachry t1nally submitted a draft design for\n\nthe cut~off waiL Like the odginul freeze wall design, the draft cut-off wnU design was prepared\n\nby RKK's engineering        firm~   GeoEngineers. The late delivery dutu of tliis   da~igtt   was another\n\ninstance of inexcusable delay by Zachry. Despite having known since at least Febt·uury that it\n\n\n\ndesign wm: tmdcrway, Zachry waited uutil All gust to autho.rize the de.sig11 work.\n\n         18.       Consistent with Zachry's earlier slate.tntmts that it intended to provide the Pori\n\n\n\nexpre.\"sly invited such review and comment. GeoEngim:crs noted that its desigo            \\Vas   l1Jcrely a\n\ndraft and would be made final only atier GeoBi1gineers incorporated comments fh:nn the Port\n\nAuthority's eommltanis. Zachry's transmittal message underlined this point, stating thar the draft\n\nwas intt:Jnded to give the Port Authority \"the ability to     se~   what   wm be happening and gather\nquestions they might have fbr the engineer.\"\n\n\n\nthe   cuL~on'   wall wmild include freezing in and around the piers to a much greater extent and at\n\ngre<ttter dtsp!hs lhan Zachry had disclosed in discussions in A11dl<             Contrary to Zachry's\n\nrepresentations during the negotiation of Change Order 4, freezing was lndee4 an issue in the\n\nsubmitted design; the design showed freciing at greater depths, and aJ'fecling many more piers,\n\nthan Zachry had represented. The Pmt Authority had no <Jbjection either to the use of a cut-off\n\nwall or to the use offh:eze wall tcc:hnology in the Cl.ltmoffwttlL Howt::ver1 it was concemed about\n\n                                                     7\n\fthe prox irnity of the. freezing to the drilled piers and the resultant risk to the structure. ThUS1 the\n\nPort Authmity responded tn the draft design on October 11, 2005 by noting its concern over the\n\npropnsed freezing near the piers and by instructing Zachry to. ' 1revise and resubmit\" the draft\n\ndesign by presenting either an alten1ative cutoff wall dm;ign or            1u1   \"alternative means of\n\nmitig{tting risk to tho :stnwtural integrity of the wharf.''\n\n        zo.     TJ1e Port Authority delivered its    r~sponse   at an October 11, 2005 meeting at' the\n\nBuyport site. After the Pmt Authority explained its conre!TJ) Andet•son promised that Zachry\n\nwould work with the Port Authority to come up with acceptable desiE:,'TI nmdificaJions. The Port\n\nAutl:J.otity believed Zachry,      GenEnginecrs already had told one of the Port Authority's\n\nconsultants that OeoEnginecrs could easily modily his d<:Sign, or crcnte an alternative design, to\n\naddress the Poresoonccms.\n\n        21.     Within a few weeks, GcoBnginccrs did prepare a ntodlflr~d design whlch, while\n\ncontinuing to use tl'eeze technology, avoided any freezing in rmd among the drilled piers. When\n\nGeol!:nglnecrs showed the modified design to the Port Authority's consultant, he smted that if\n\nZachry !lubmittod the modified deslgrJ, he would npprove it without delay~\n\n        22.     By that point, however, Zachry's mas:·iivo scheduling problems ovetwhe1med all\n\notl1er considerations, including the out-off wall. In earl}t Octohet· of 2005, aficr submission of\n\nthe draft cutoff wall design andprior to the Port Authority's response to the dralt cutoff wall\n\ndesign, Zachry .revealed to the Port Authority that it \\\\tould be 35 days late in meeting the\n\nMilestone A   date~   the very date to which Zachry hod just agreed in Change Order 4. The Port\n\nAuthority, surprised by this revelation, demanded thal Zachry present a schedule recovery plan\n\nin accordance wiih the Contract.\n\f        23.     17oe the first time, Zachry finally began to attempt to detail the ft·eeze wall and\n\ncutoff wall activities in its schedules. It quickly discovered that 35 days late was a gross\n\nunderestimate; in eady November Zachry prepmed detailed schedules (which it concealed from\n\nthe Port Authority) reflecting that Milestone A would not be achieved until Deccn1ber 30, 2006.\n\nAs Zachry further refined its schedules, matters only became worse.              By   mid~Novcmber,\n\nZachry's scheduk1s showed that with a freeze wall, it would not achieve Milestone A until May\n\nof 2007.      Moreover, those schedules predicted it could achieve Milestone A and Final\n\nCompletion much sooner by abandoning the freeze waiL\n\n        24.      When Anderson saw the refined sclmdules, which showed Zachry desperately\n\nbehind schedule, he detennined that the only way Zachry touid hope to have !he wharf prepared\n\nto land the cranes would be to abandon the freeze wall, dig as deeply as possible without a freeze\n\nwall, and then work in the wet. (Even at that, Zachry would not he able to perform all tbe\n\ndredging and excavation required by the Contract as part of the Milestone A work, and \\vould\n\nhave to defer such work until ailer the ctancs were unloaded.) On November l, 2005; Anderson\n\ngave orders to cancel all orders for freeze wall rnatedals and to slowly rernove Zachry personnel\n\n.itom the ii·eeze walt area,\n\n        25.      Amazingly; Anderson did not advise the Port Authority or RKK that he had given\n\nthese inslmctiot1S. instead, he confected lies      to Zachryts management to e>:J)luin why he was\nabandoning    H fi·eeze   wall in vvhich Zachry ttlre.ady had invested some $9 million. He reported to\n\nhJs m1pervisors that chitters .needed to cool the brine that would cin~uLa1e through the freeze pipes\n\nhad been \"commandeered\" hy FEMA in consequence ofHunicum~s Rita and Katrina. He then\n\nattempted to {jnlist RKK in this fraud, mging RKK to report a clliller shmtage so Anderson could\n\nJbrward the false report to the Port Authority. Anderson threatened RKK with financial harm if\n\n                                                     9\n\fattempt to Zachry*s management. Zachry's management, however, never bothered to investi.gate\n\nthis shocking report. To the contrary, Zachry's management continued to rely on Anderson for\n\ninformation about wbat was happening at the l3aypolt job site.\n\n       26,     Appreciating that his lie about commandeered chillers would not find support,\n\nAnderson modified tl1e lie by reporting to Zachry management tbat some chillers were available,\n\nbut not enough to operate the freeze wall adequate1y1 and in consequence the fi·eezing would take\n\nmuch longer thnn planned.\n\n       27.     Anderson also invented n second lie tn Zachry mtmagement: that sheet pile\n\nrequired ibr the alternative cut-off wall de;Jign was unavailable, and would remain unavailable\n\nfor months. Anderson lold this He desnite knowing that the sheet. pile was available for\n\ni:n.unedinte delivery from !ievernl different suppliers; RKK had oonfinned this fuct to Anderson.\n\n       zs.     In making the decision to abandon the freeze wall, Zachry had not prepared any\n\ncost or Cllf:,rincerlng analysis to determine whether its revised conslruclion plan, which Zachry\n\nhas somethncs referred lo as \"Ptan H,jj wus sensible or, indeed, even feasible.          h had not\n\nevaluated whether il1l estimated excavation rales or o!htlf production rat(}s were realistic. It had\n\nnot determined how it would excavate bem7nth the wharf deck. It had not dctem1ined how\n\ndeeply it could snfely excavate with an unfi·ozen berm. H hod not addressed the problems\n\ncreated by u,roundwater infiltration. It had$ in short, nq reliable way of evaluating the time\n\nrequired fbr, tlm costs entailed by, or tl1e risks and benefils of Plan B, and no rcHable way of\n\nc.ompadng the time, costs, risks, and benetits of Plana with those of the freeze walL\n\n       29.     Representatives of Zachry nml the Port Authority had n series of meetings and\n\nphone conversations in October, Novernber, nm1 December of 2005 to discuss the scheduling\n\n                                                 !Q\n\fissues. Zut1hry told the Port that it had detem1ined to abandon the main freeze wan because it\n\nwas out of time to implement the freeze wall and stilt meet the contractually required completion\n\ndates for Milestone A and Final Completion. Zachry told the Port Authority that more water was\n\nflowing fhnn tl1e land side than Zachry had anticipated and that it could not freeze the soil\n\nquieldy enough,        Zachry suid its schedules     show~d   thttt abandoning the freeze Viall and\n\nproceeding instead \\\\1th Plan 13 ·-working in the dry behind a n\\>tv11~ozen berm to a certfti n depth\n\nand   lh~m   working ln the wet thet'eailcr •w would result iu the earliest practicable achievement of\n\nthe Miles.tnne A and Final Completion dates.\n\n        30.       At no point during any of the many rneetings or convenmtions .in late 2005 did\n\nZ.n:chty ever sta.tc or even suggest, as it much later would clairn ln this lawsuit~ that its decision to\n\nabandon tho freeze     Wti!l \\VM   connected with any supposed 1'rejection\" of the draft cut:..offwall\n\ndesign, as Zachry now ctairns in this lawsuit .Zachry made no sucl1 rmggestion because the\n\ntnodificalions thnt the Pott Authority requested to the submittal of the draft design played no role\n\nin Znchry;s decision to abandon the frcczo Wtill.\n\n        :l l.     Bad Zachry asserted in any of the coiwersations in late :wos, a.'! it later would in\n\nthis lawsuit, that it was abandoning the ti:ee%e wall as a result of the Port Authority•s i'evise and\n\nresubmit rc._<;ponse to the dmfl cut~off waH design submittal, that abandonment .of the freeze wall\n\n\\vas going to del11y Zachry's completkm of the project and increase Zachry's cost tb complefe1\n\nand thut the Port was somehow responsible for the resulliog delay and increased costs to Zachry,\n\nthen there is no doubt that the entire tenol' of those cmwersnHonN would have chtmgcd~ and that\n\nthe Ptwt Authority promptly would have, at a minimum. instructed Zachry to delete the '''harf'\n\nexlensitm from the scope of ils work under the Contract\n\f                32.     Zachry's planning, estimating1 and execution have proved to be no better since it\n\n         abandoned the fi·eeze waH tl1au before it did so. Through no fault of the Port Authority! Zacluy\n\n         failed to execute the work in accordance with any of the numerous schedules it prepared for\n\n         complc!lng the project using the Plan B construction method. Zacht'y did not dec!u:ro final\n\n         completion of its work until January of2009.\n\n                33.     Unbeknownst to the Port Authority, the \"Zachry\" entity with \\Yhich the Port\n\n         Authority contractt1d apparently Cklased perfom1ing the Work on the Contract. Instead. Zacluy\n\n         ch1mged its nmne and Zachry's parent company created a       new comp!l.nY to assume Zachry's\n                                                                                          \"\n         name - lhc name Zachry Constmction Corporation.           In lnte 2007 r Zachry asked the Pmt\n\n         Authority for its oonsent to an assignment of the Contract The Port Authority responded that it\n\n         would consent to the assignment upon satisfttction by Z11chry of several reasonable conditions.\n\n         Zachry di.d nm agree to or satisfy the conditions. In fact, Zachry ignmed the Por! Authority's\n\n         response.    Instead of respondit1g to the Port Authority or satisfying the conditions, on\n\n         infbrmntkm and belief., on January 1, 2008 and without knowledge of the Port Authority, the nmv\n\n         company apparently began pertbrming Zac1ny's CJbligutions ~mdcr tl1e Contract. Zachry assigned\n\n         its obligations under the Contract to the new company in breach o:f Section 3.13, apparently\n\n         ceased to employ   OJHiite   supervision in breacll of Section 5J 61 and apparently ceased self-\n\n         peribrming the Work and engaged a subc~)ntractor not disclosed to the Port Authority in breach\n\n         oJ Scclion 5.11 of the General Conditions.\n\n                34.     Apparently, the new company (which did uot have u contract wit11 the Port\n\ni.f\"\".   Authority but had assumed the name of Znchry) with Zachry's knowledge and at Zachry's\n\n         instruction submitted invoices for Work and signed releases to induce the Port Authority to make\n\n         payment. Zachry thereafter represented to the Port Authority that the claims in this titigntion\n\n                                                         12\n\fw<:r(: Zachry's claims and that all cost.'l which it sought as damages were incurred by Zachry,\n\nEven Zachry's damages documentation- disclosed to the Port Authority only after order of the\n\nCow·t -· states that all costs were incurred by Zachry.

Tn tho event the payments from the Port Authority wen:: leas thun the amounts\n\nincurred by the new com puny, the tR~w company agreed that Zachry had no liability to          th~;   new\n\noompatly.

Zachry's allegations that the Port Authority hns impropedy withheld payment and\n\nfulled to pny Zachry does not constitute breach of Contmct us alleged by Zachry.            I1H~   Port\n\nAuthority paid Zachry in accordance with the terms of the Contract and applicable law.\n\nMoreover, Zachry ugreed to a Iv!ilestone A date and a Final Completion date. Zuchry agreed to\n\nliquidated damages Jn the event it foiled to meet these dates, Zachry failed to meet the Mllestone\n\nA date and the Final Completion date. In addition, Z,achry failed to properly perform Work and\n\nthe Port Autlmdty had to puy another contractor to correct or mitigate harm caused by Ztwl1ry's\n\ndefective Work. The Port A.uthotity's withholding of monies from payments to Zachry is\n\nffU1'POJied hy enforceable provisions of the Contract} including the right to withhold payments\n\n(Section 6.05 of the General Conditions), the right of offset (Section 6.11 of the General\n\nConditions)) the right ro liquidated damages (Section 5.05 of the Gem,ral Conditions). the right\n\nto actual damages in lieu ofliquidated damages (Section 5.06 ofthc General Conditions)t and the\n\nSpecificntion and   l~oposal   {setting forth the concept of reduction of the contract price for late\n\nperformtmce).

At the same time, Zachry was concerned that there was no guarantee the freeze\n\nwall would work in a saf(} manner, or indeed would work at alL So; for these many reasons; for\n\nits own economic advantage, and in an effort to minimize its own potential liability under t'ha\n\nContract, Zachry det~r.mined to abandon the usc oflhe main freeze wall.\n\n         ln late 200Si Zachry represented to the Port Authority that Zachry would complete the\n\nWork by spcC'J:fied dales using wlu1.t hns been referred to as Plntl B~ nan:tely1 a hybrid approach\n\ninvolVing working' bnth in the dry and in the wet~ These stateruen1s tnade by .Zachry were either\n\nknowingly fahm m· W{~fe rnade t'ecklessly, The Port Authority relit~d on these topresontat1ons to\n\nits detriment.

(Each of these objections, individually or collectively, \"Beyond the\n      Rules.\"). The P01t of Houston specifically objects to Interrogatory 1\\o. I us Vague with respect to\n      the term \"vn!ue, and the phrase \"in regards to performance of the Contract.\"\n\n      The Port of Houston objects to the defmition of \"Zachry\" set forth in puragraph 2 of Plaintiffs\n      Fourth Set of interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the Port of Houston as\n      Vague, because the tem1 is defined in relevant part as meaning \"Zachry Construction\n      Corporation\", a name in fact used by more than one company that was involved on the Project:\n      one is the Port of Houston's counterparty as named, defined and agreed upon in the Bayport\n«\"I   Tenninal Complex Phase 1A V./harl' & Dredging Contract; at least one other is not. furthermore,\nc\n      the Port of Houston understands that the correct name of Plaintiff is now Zachry Industrial, lnc.\n      Il appears that the entity formerly known as \"Zachry Construction Corporation\" engaged in\n      transactions such that it no longer performed the Work under the Phase lA Wharf and Dredging\n      Contract, without the prior knowledge of the Port of Houston and in breach of the Contract. The\n      Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"Zachry\" to the extent that it suggests thut the Port of\n      Houston has a contract for the work under the Phase l A Wharf & Dredging Contract with any\n      entiry other than the entity that originally executed the Ph.lA vVharf & Dredging Contract as the\n      \"Contractor.\" The Port of Houston, by its use of the te1m \"Zachry'' in these objections and\n      responses, refers to the entity that is the \"Contractor\" under the Phase IA Wharl' & Dredging\n      Contract.\n\n\n                                                        2\n\f      The Po11 of Houston objects to the definition of \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\" and\n      each and every interrogatory that includes the tenn \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\"\n      to the extent that Zachry intends for the tenn ''Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or \"Contract\" to\n      mean that tl1e Bayport Terminal Complex Phase lA Wharf and Dredging Contract includes a\n      greater scope of work or authority or discretion for Zachry than, in fact, it does. For example,\n      Zachry's definition states thal the contract is for the \"d~ign, construction and procurement\" of a\n      wharf facility, but, in fact, the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract is not a design build\n      contract or 'm engineer, procure and construct contract as implied by the definition. Zachry's\n      scope of work is set forth in the Phase IA Wharf and Dredging Contract and the Pot1 of Houston\n      will respond in accordance with the actual scope of the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract.\n\n      The Port of Houston further objects to the interrogatories to the extent they would require\n      information protected or exempted from discovery by any applicable privilege or immunity. In\n      all instances, the Port of Houston intends to preserve and claim, where applicable, the\n      attomey/client privilege, the work product immunity, the common interest privilege, the\n      consulting expert privilege, the executive session privilege pursuant to Sections 551.104 and\n      551.146, Texas Government Code, of the Texas Open Meetings Act, the maritime security\n      privilege pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114 and 49 C.F.R. pt. 1520, and any other privilege, immunity or\n      other legal ptinciple or rule that protects or exempts from disclosure documents or other\n      information requcgted by the Plaintiff.\n\n      Pursuant to Texas RuleofCivil Procedure 197.1 and its comment no. I, parts (i) and (vii) ofthe\n      interrogatories are expressly objected to to the extent that the interrogatories \\vould require the\n      Port of Houston to state all of its factual assertions about its subject matter. 111e Port of Houston\n      assumes that in propounding the interrogatories, Zachry is not asking the Port of Houston to\n      marshal the evidence with respect to the subject matters addressed by the interrogatory and the\n      Port of Houston, pursuant to Texas Rule of Procedure 197.1 and its comment no. 1, objects to\n      any request or demand by Zachry that the P011 of Houston so marshal.\n\n      Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 197 .2(c), to the extent the answer to the\n      inte1Togat.ories may be derived or ascertained tlum the Pmt of Houston's business records that\n      httve been or will be produced in this case, the Port of Houston objects on the basis that the\n      burden for deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the Port of Houston\n      as it is for Zachry.\n\n      Subject to its objections and based on the stated assumptions, the Port of Houston answers\nC'l   Zachry's Fourth Set of Interrogatories as follows:\n\n              Under the Contract, Zachry was required to complete Area A by February 15, 2006 and\n      the entirety of tlle Work by July 15, 2006. Both deadlines were subsequently extended 9 days\n      for Hunicane Rita. Zachry failed to meet either deadline. Zachry did not declare completion of\n      the Work under the Contract until January of 2009 and continued to work on Area A unlit that\n      time. The Work, however, still is not complete, a point of discussion between the pat1ies.\n\n             The Port of Houston does not know the universe of work that may not have been properly\n      performed by Zachry or the universe of Zachry's failure to comply with the Contract. Jvloreover,\n      Zachry has continuing warranty obligations that apply to any work that was not properly\n\n\n                                                        3\n\f        performed by Zachry and the Port of Houston expects that Zachry will comply with such\n        obligations. The Port of Houston's knowledge of deficient Work by Zachry, however, includes\n        deficient crane ruil installation, deficiencies in the fender coatings, deficiencies in the pavement\n        striping, deficient dust plan, and deficiencies in advanced cruise dredging. Furthermore, the Port\n        of Houston has been har-med by Zachry's failure to pay for overtime inspections and the Port of\n        Houston's various concessions in an effort to facilitate Zachry's completion of the work. These\n        concessions include agreeing to allow Zachry to install fabric fonned revetment in lieu of the\n        articulated block mat Zachry was contractually required to install. In addition, the Port of\n        Houston incurred significant costs in evaluating proposals from Zachry in Zachry's effort to\n        provide the Port of Houston with less than it had agreed to provide, such as Zachry's proposal to\n        revise the l.mder wharf slope.\n\n                The Port of Houston cannot know the precise nature and extent of damages caused by\n        Zachry's failure to timely meet the Milestone A deadline, failure to timely complete the Project,\n        failures to properly perfonn the Work, and fi·aud. In addition to the readily quantifiable harm\n        Zachry caust:d the Port of Houston, Zachry hunncd the Port of Houston in ways thut are very\n        difficult to quantify.\n\n                Subject to the foregoing, the estimated costs associated with the above identiiled known\n        deficiencies in Zachry's Work include the following:\n\n                    •   Cost to correct defective fender coating: estimated as S509,312.48\n\n                    •   Co~>t   to install fenders: estimated as $478,450.00\n\n                    •   l'ailure to complete clearing and grubbing on the South side of Port Road:\n                        $25,200.00 (to be deducted from amounts due Zachry per agreement with Zachry)\n\n                    •   Deficient crane rail installation: inspection cost S7,460.00; future cost unknown at\n                        this time\n\n                    •   Defective striping: approximately $180,000.00\n\n                    o   Deficient dust plan: approximately $10,000.00\n\n                    •   Cost for Work outside of normal hours: at least $73,536.22\nC'l\n                    •   Investigate means of removing soil from under wbatf deck: at least $24,900.00\n\n'<J\n                    •   Cost to evaluate fabric fonned revetment: at least $30,246.77\n :;[}\n :c\nc..\n                    o   Decrease in cost to Zachry for substitution of fabric f01med revetment: at least\n                        $450,000.00\n\n                    •   Jncrea<;e in cost to Port of Houston for maintenance of fabric fonned revetment:\n ij\n                        Not yet dctennined\n.:::.\n\nz-                  •   Cost to evaluaL~ altemrnive anchor design: at least $7,500.00\n\n                                                            4\n\f                 •    Cost to evaluate elimination of revetment: at least $20,170.73\n\n                 •    Cost to evaluate various under wharf deck slopes: at least $245,491 .58\n\n                 •    Cost to inspect and review proposed repair of defective drilled shafts: at least\n                      $26,195.00\n\n             With respect to Zachry's defective dredging under Change Order ;\\o. I to the Contract,\n      i.e. the \"advanced cruise dredging\" work, Zachry dredged outside of the dredge profile of the\n      Contract, destabiJizing the adjacent shoreline and altering the condition of the site as advertised\n      in hid proposal documents for the Cmise Wharf and Dredging Contract. Zachry's failures\n      necessitated the Port of Houston having the contractor of the Cruise Wharf and Dredging\n      Contract, Orion, mitigate and repair the hann caused by Zachry, The amount of such payments\n      to Orion is $600,000.00.\n\n              Tho Port of Houston's harm due to Zachry's failure to timely complete Milestone A and\n      the entire Project includes, without limitation, additional progrrun management consuJtant and\n      engineering fees, additional time spent and resources devoted by the Pmt of Houston's\n      engineering department, lost business, and loss of use of construction materials. The difficulty\n      of quantifying and proving such actual damages is one of the reasons the purties agreed to the\n      Contract price reduction and liquidated damages provisions in the Contract. The full amount of\n      harm caused by the delay is unknown.\n\n              Subject to the foregoing, the Port of Houston incurred at least the following additional\n      costs for additional consultant services perfmmed through January 2009 as a result of Zachry's\n      failure to timely complete the work:\n\n                 •    $46,970.85 for Geotest;\n\n                 •    $1,118,953.24forCH2MHill;\n\n                 •    $130,750.00 for Overlond Assessments; and\n\n                  •   $74,617.29torDMJ!vl\n\n              In addition, the Port of Houston paid $172,871.82 to Paradigm for services after July\n      2006 in connection with both the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging l>roject and the Container Yard\nC'l\n      project. A portion, which can be detennined from the documents produced in discovery, is\n      associated with the Zachry caused delay on the Phase l A Wharf & Dredging Project.\n\n             Zachry also caused the Port of Houston's engineering department to expend ao additional\n      approximately 3,299 man hours on the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Project from August 2006\n      through Junuary 2009, which represents an expense to the Port of Houston of $220,044.98.\n      Other Port of Houston personnel were required to expend additional time on the Phase I A \\Vharf\n      & Dredging Project as well, but do not keep track of their time, so a readily quantifiable amount\n      representing the additional increased expense to the Port of Houston on the Phase lA Wharf &\n      Uredging for their time is not cummtly available.\n\n\n\n                                                        5\n\f              In addition to the additional expense incurred on the Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Project\n      for extended personnel time, the time spent by the Port of Houston personnel on the Phase l A\n      Wharf & Dredging Project during this time period would have been spent on other projects,\n      resulting in additional losses to the Port of Houston. These losses of are difficult to quantify.\n\n             Zachry's failure to timely complete the Work of the on the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging\n      Project precluded Porl of Houston customers from using the Bayport Tenninal Complex as soon\n      as they otherwise could have. The steamship lines that moved from Barbours Cut Terminal to\n      Bayport collectively increased container volume from 77,586 vessel lifts in 2006 to 102,413\n      vessel lifls in 2007 (an increase of 32%). At the same time, steamship lines remaining at\n      Barbours Cul Tenninal filled the void left by the relocation of can·iers to Bayport, and Barbours\n      Cut Terminal <:ontainerizt::d cargo still incn::ttsed by 3% over the previous year. The Port of\n      Houston believes that the same full capacity use would have occurred if the wharf had opened on\n      time in July 2006. Thus, the Port of Houston lost over six months of cargo resulting in an\n      estimated $620,000 decrease in revenue as a result of late completion of the entirety of the work.\n      In addition, when the first customer began using Bayport, the customer leased a portion of the\n      container yard. The Port of Houston believes that it would have leased tht:: container yard earlier\n      had the project been completed on time in July 2006, resulting in a loss of lease revenue of\n      $210,000.\n\n               BC(;ause Zachry did not complete the dredging in a timely manner using mechanical\n      means, Zachry was allO\\'led to utilize hydraulic dredging in the fall of 2006, after the project\n      completion deadline, to complete the dredging so that the Port of Houston could utilize the\n      facility upon Zachry's sufficient completion of a portion of the wharf (albeit still incomplete).\n      The estimated h<mn to the P011 of Houston as a result of Zuchry's use of hydraulic drt::dging due\n      to its failure to complete the dredging within the contract time is ut least $2,500,000. The harm\n      includes U1e cost to manage the hydraulic dredge material and close the hydraulic dredge ponds\n      to prepare for future constn.1ction.\n\n              Moreover, Zachry's failure to timely dredge material from the Bayport channel and to\n      excavate material from beneath the wharf deck deprived the Port of Houston of the opportunity\n      to have the matetials available as fill as soon as the materials should have been for usc on other\n      projects. Thus, fill material that should have been provided from one or both of such sources,\n      because of Zachry's delays, had to be obtained from borrow pits at an estimated cost of\n      $470,000.\n\nC'l          The full amount of the harm to the Port of Houston as a result of Zachry's failure to\n      timely meet the Milestone A deadline, failure to timely complete the Project, and failures to\n      properly perform the Worl< is difficult to quantify. The Port of Houston has suffered at least\n      $8,079,799 in quantifiable damages, but the total hmm to the Port of Houston is higher.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       6\n\f                                    REQUESTS FOR PRODUCI'ION\n\n      GENERAL 0BJEGI'IONS TO R EQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION:\n\n      With respect to Zachry's Fourth Request for Production, the Port of Houston hereby objects as\n      follows:               ·\n\n      1.      The Port of llouston objects to each and every request to the extent that such request\n      would requjre infonnation protected or exempted from discovery by any applicable privilege or\n      immunity. In all instances, the Port of Houston intends to preserve and claim, where applicable,\n      th~ uttomey/clitmt privilege, the work product immunity, the common interest p1ivi!ege, the\n      consulting expert p1ivilege, the executive session privilege pursuant to Sections 551.104 and\n      55 1.146, Texas Government Code, of the Texas Open Meetings Act, the maritime security\n      privilege pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 114 and 49 C.F.R, pt. 1520, and any other privilege, immunity or\n      other legal principle or rule that protects or exempts from disclosure documents or other\n      information requested by the Plaintiff. The foregoi ng objection is referred throughout the below\n      objections as \"Privileged.\"\n\n      2.      The Port of Houston objects to each and every request to U1e extent that it is vague\n      (\"Vague\"), unduly burdensome (\"Unduly Burdensome\"), overly broad (\"Overly Broad\") or\n      seeks to impose obligations or burdens on the Port of Houston beyond those imposed by the\n      Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, including without limitation the Rules of Civil Procedure\n      applicable to discovery of magnetic or electronic data (each of these objections, individually or\n      collectively, \"Beyond the Rules.\")\n\n      3.      The Pmt of 1-touston objects to the definition of ''Zachry\" set forth in paragraph 2 of\n      Plaintiff's Fourth Set nf Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the Port of\n      Huustun as Vague, because the term is defined in relevant patt as meaning \"Zachry Constn1cUon\n      Corporation\", a name in fact used by more than one company that was involved on the Project:\n      one is the Port of Houston's counter-party as named, defined and agreed upon in the Bayport\n      Te1minal Complex Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Contract; nt least one other is not. Furthennore,\n      tJ1e P011 of Houston understands that the corret:l m1me of Plaintiff is now Zachry Industrial, Inc.\n      lt appears that the entity formerly known as \"Zachry Constn1ction Corporation\" engaged in\n      transactions such that it no longer perfonned the Work lmdcr the Phase lA Wbarf & Dredging\n      Contract, without the prior knowledge of the Port of Houston and in breHch of the Contract. The\n      P011 ofHouston objects to the definition of\"Zachry\" to the extent that it suggests that the Port of\nC'l\n      Houston has a contract for the work under the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Contract with any\n      entity other than the entity that originally executed the Phase 1A Wharf & Dredging Contract as\n      the \"Contractor.\" The Port of Houston, by its use of the tenn \"Zachry\" in these objections, refers\n      to the entity that is the \"Contractor\" under the Phase lA Wharf & Dredging Contract.\n\n      4.     The Pott of Houston objects to the definition of \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" and each and every request that includes the tenn \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" to the extent that Zachry intends for the term \"Wharf and Dredge Contract\" or\n      \"Contract\" to mean that the Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n      includes a greater scope of work or authority or discretion for Zt~chry than, in tact, it does. For\n      example, Zachry's definition states thnt the contract is for the \"design, construction and\nz\n\n                                                       7\n\f       procurement\" of a wharf facility, but, in fact, the Phase lA Wharf and Dredging Contract is not a\n       design bui1d contract or an engineer, procure and construct contracl as implied by the definition.\n       Zachry's scope of work is set forth in the Phase IA Vv'harfand Dredging Contract and the Port of\n       Houston will respond in accordance with the actual scope of the Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging\n       Contract The foregoing objection is referred to below as \"Contract.\"\n\n       5.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaint(ffs Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production to the extent that the definition (i) inaccurately characterizes or seeks to\n       expand Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(b), (ii) could be construed to require the Port ofHouston to locate\n       or produce doctm1ents no longer in its possession, custody, or control, (iii) would result in any\n       obligation or burden that is Beyond the Rules, and (iv) calls for documents that can be obtained\n       from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive than\n       demanding these documents from the Port of Houston.\n\n       G.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production as Unreasonably Burdensome, duplicative, Vague and Beyond the Rules\n       to the extent that the definition could be construed to require the Porl of Houston to produce both\n       paper and electronic versions of the same identical document, notwithstanding use of the term\n       \"non-identical\" in the definition.\n\n       7.      The Port of Houston objects to the definition of \"document\" in paragraph 7 under the\n       Definitions and Instructions heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth\n       Request for Production and the phruse \"care, custody or control\" as used therein to the extent-\n       PlaintifT seeks to expand the scope of the Port of Houston's obligation to produce documents\n       beyond Tex. R. Civ. P. 192.3(b) and 192.7(b) or thut is othen.vise Beyond the Rules.\n\n       8.     The Port of Houston objects to paragraph ll under the Definitions and Instructions\n       heading of Plaint(ff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to require a privilege Jog that is Beyond the Rules or to reqtJirc the Port of\n       Houston to provide a privilege log sooner than required by the Texas Rules of Civjl Procedure.\n\n       9.     The Port of Houston objects to paragraph 12 under the Definitions and Instructions\n       heading of Plaint!ffs Fourth Set of interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to impose obligations upon the Port of Houston that are Beyond the Rules,\nC\"'l   including without limitation obligations in excess of those imposed by Tex. R. Civ. P. 196.4.\n\n       l 0.    Tbe Port of Houston objects to paragraph 13 under the Definitions and Instmctions\n       heading of Plaintiff's Fourth Set of Interrogatories and Fourth Request for Production to the\n       extent it seeks to impose obligations upon the Port of Houston that are Beyond the Rules.\n\n       11.     The Port of Houston objects to Zachry's Fourth Requests for Production as duplicative\n       (''Duplicative\").\n\n\n\n\n                                                        8\n\f     12.    The foregoing objections are hereby incorporated by reference into each other and into\n     each individual response below. The foregoing objections and the objections lodged below\n     should be construed as supplementing and not as conflicting with one another.\n\n     Subject to such general objections, the Po1t of Houston specifically objects and responds to each\n     request as set forth below.\n\n     REouEsT No. 1:\n\n             All documents or communications concerning, relating, or regarding any hatm You\n     contend that You have suffered as a result of Zachry's alleged misconduct in connection with its\n     perfonnance of the Contract, including but not limited to all documents or communications\n     regarding your contention that \"[t]he Port Authority's harm includes, without limitation,\n     additional program management consultant and engineering design fees, additional time spent\n     and resources devoted by the Port Authority's engineering department, lost business, and Joss of\n     use of construction materials ...[and] The Port Authority has also been banned by Zachry's\n     advance cmise dredging, which was defectively performed pursuant to a change order to the\n     Contract.\" This request includes, but is not limited to, any and all documents evidencing and\n     quantifying each such alleged harm.\n\n     RESPONSE ANI) OBJECTIONS:\n\n            The Port of Houston objects to the request as discovery that \\Vas propounded after lhe\n     close of the discovery period of this case and without leave of Court having been requested or\n     granted.\n\n             Subject to the foregoing objection, lhe Port of Houston incorporates the general\n     objections stated above and specifically objects as follows: Privileged, Vague with respect to the\n     term \"suffered,\" Contract, and Duplicative.\n\n             Subject to the foregoing objections, the Port of Houston responds as follows: The Port of\n     Houston has produced relevant, non-privileged, non-objected to responsive documents sought by\n     this request.

Freezing is slow and we will have plenty of notice regarding the\n                             rate of freezing. During the design we will analyze the rate and extent of freezing with\n                             TEMP/W, a fini te difference program that we have used on dozens of projects with great\n                             prediction of actual freeze behavior.\n\n                              We also plan to perform a freeze/thaw strength test to determine the actual reduction in\n                              strength of the soil after it thaws out. Based on the literature of previous testing, the\n                               reduction after one cycle should not be significant. We also have the capability of\n                               evaluating the impacts of a reduced soil strength some distance from the pilings using\n                               finite element programs. However, based on our extensive experience with soil\n                               strengths, we do not feel that this will be necessary. We do not feel that our wall wilJ\n                             . ha~e any significant impact on the integrity of the dtilled shafts.

Of\n      · course the Soi!Freeze system at Bayport will use f~wer, mo~e powerful and, when fully\n         integrated, more.efficient chillers. Again, the number, refrigeration tonnage and weight\n         of the chillers in the overall system configurati9n and the number of electrical panels will\n         depend on the engineer's design.

THIESS: Okay. Anyone have other\n8    issues with the wharf?\n9                   MR. ANDERSON: Yeah I have two items I\n10 want to bring up. We need to get like an official okay\n11 about bringing this ship in on the west end of the\n12 wharf. We have talked about it. We put it in, I think\n13 the last time Mark was going to look at whether or not\n14 there was a conflict with the electrical service that\n15 went to the west. We haven't heard back. We've always\n16 been - - since the beginning, we've been moving on the\n17 basis that the ship would come in on the west end\n18 rather than the east.\n19                  MR. ELY: You're talking about the barge\n20 to unload the cranes?\n21                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah.\n22                  MR. ELY: Okay.\n23                  MR. THIESS: Now, with this new potential\n24 section it's really critical.\n25                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah with the 330-foot\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0002\n\f                                                               3\n1    extension, it now almost mandates that the ship come in\n2    on the west end. So we need to get something concrete\n3    from the Port that says it's okay. Because under the\n4    contract, I'm required to give you the east end. I just\n5    need to get that clarified.\n6                   MR. THIESS: I think the best way would\n7    be to get an RFI in and get it on the clock.\n8                   MR. ANDERSON: I think - did we not put\n9    one in already?\n10                  MR. ROGERS: No. We were - -\n11                  MR. ANDERSON: I know we were talking\n12 about doing it. All right. Let's get one in and let's\n13 put some verbiage in it about the fact that with this\n14 upcoming 330-foot extension it mandates that the ship\n15 come in on the west end. The last - if I remember the\n16 conversation the last time, I think even Mark said that\n17 even if they unloaded at the west end it still wasn't\n18 an issue because if they had to move the crane, they\n19 could always tow it -\n20                  MR. GLASGOW: Tow it down.\n21                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, they could always\n22 tow it wherever they needed to go. And from what I\n23 understand, once the cranes are on the track, it's just\n24 a commissioning issue. So they really don't have to\n25 move anywhere. And so that's the - - that's the big.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0003\n\f                                                                  4\n1                   issue that I have, is getting that\n2    clarified.\n3                   MR. THIESS: Okay.\n4                   MR. ELY: Hang on just a second. If we\n5    did that, if we pushed all the cranes - - how many cranes\n6    are we getting, four?\n7                   MR. THIESS: Four.\n8                    MR. ELY: If we pushed all of the cranes\n9    over to the west side, would we be able to hook up\n10 temporary power to do the commissioning?\n11                   MR. ANDERSON: Oh, I would think so.\n12                   MR. ELY: Okay. Because I think that's\n13 probably the only issue, right? Because the cables are\n14 not going to reach that far. And so if we could run\n15 just a temporary conduit across the deck, and I can get\n16 power to the cranes, then I don't see any issue.\n17                   MR. ANDERSON: I don't see that being a\n18 problem. We've come up with a design that we'll be\n19 proposing to you guys on the freeze wall, where - - you\n20 know, in this 330-foot extension, we are going to\n21 design in a cutoff wall that will allow us to reach the\n22 freeze wall and open 900 feet of it up while we\n23 continue to work towards the east end. All right.\n24                There,is one upcoming issue that we are going\n25 to have that we have - we believe we have found a\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0004\n\f                                                                5\n1    solution to. We'll probably, once we finalize it, we'll\n2    give it to you formal, but you may as well know about it\n3    now.\n4               There is - - the cutoff wall involves a sheet\n5    pile bin wall structure being built about 8 feet wide\n6    that the soil between the bin walls will be frozen. This\n7    encompasses one B row piling right in the middle of it.\n8    Now, the freezing is not the issue, because the pile\n9    goes 40 feed deep or 50 feet deeper than the soil\n10 that's being frozen - -\n11                  MR. THIESS: Andy, I'm sorry. One thing\n12 with that - - how deep is the wall?\n13                  MR. ANDERSON: About 100 feet.\n14                  MR. THIESS: How deep is the pile?\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, actually, it's 90\n16 feet below zero, so 90 feet cuz elevation's plus 10 at\n17 the top.\n18                  MR. THIESS: And the B row pile is --\n19                  MR. ANDERSON: About 130.\n20                  MR. THIESS: Okay. So it's about 30 feet\n21 below --\n22                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, there's 30 or 40\n23 feet of piling below the freezing matrix.\n24                  MR. THIESS: Yeah, but you still have\n25 about 40 or 50 feet of affected skin friction of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0005\n\f                                                                6\n1    pile?\n2                   MR. ANDERSON: Yes.\n3                   MR. THIESS: All right.\n4                   MR. ANDERSON: Now, but that's not the --\n5    that's not our concern. The biggest concern is that in\n6    the excavation process, eventually they're going to have\n7    unequal pressure against that bin wall because we are\n8    going to remove it on one side and you're to have the\n9    dirt pushing on it. And then eventually it's going to\n10 be\n11 reversed. You're going to have water and air on the\n12 other side. So there is a deflection in this - - in\n13 this bin wall. And first blush says that the deflection\n14 will be somewhere in the vicinity of 4 to 6 inches.\n15              That was only done it based on a\n16 two-dimensional model, so they are - - right now they\n17 have new software we're programming on a\n18 three-dimensional model to see if we can get a more\n19 accurate look at the deflection.\n20              The idea that we're using is that that one\n21 specific pile will be drilled and cased to probably 42\n22 or 48 inches, and then we'll establish a casing at 36\n23 inches, in the middle of this secondary casing. That\n24 will allow this casing to deflect with the wall and not\n25 put any lateral pressure against the piling. Our\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0006\n\f                                                               7\n1    biggest concern is not the freezing, it's the lateral\n2    pressure - -\n3                   MR. THIESS: Preloading - -\n4                   MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, preloading the pile.\n5    And - - but I think that that, you know, I think that\n6    that will solve the problem. I am fairly comfortable\n7    with what I saw, if we can keep the movement contained\n8    within that secondary casing, we should be okay.\n9                   MR. FARHAT: Do you have a sketch of what\n10 you are talking about?\n11                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, I can draw it on the\n12 board for you if you want to see it.\n13                  MR. ELY: How low would the casing go\n14 down?\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: The casing is - - the 42\n16 inch will go down as - - probably as deep as the - - what\n17 do you call it - - how deep do we want?\n18                  MR. ELY: Would it go all the way to the\n19 bottom of the sheet pile? Probably not, right?\n20                  MR. ANDERSON: No, it doesn't have to go\n21 that deep.\n22                  MR. ELY: Right.\n23                  MR. ANDERSON: And that has to be - - and\n24 obviously, once the --\n25                  MR. ELY: See that's a design mod\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0007\n\f                                                                8\n1    basically. Is that what you're saying? Right?\n2                  MR. ANDERSON: Yeah. And what we'll do\n3    is, when it comes time to remove it, divers are going to\n4    have to go down and cut the casing off the outer\n5    casing.\n6                  MR. ELY: You can't pull it, you mean?\n7                  MR. ANDERSON: Well, see, no, we can't\n8    because we're continuing to build the deck over this - -\n9                  MR. ELY: Oh, you're going to leave it in\n10 place?\n11                 MR. ANDERSON: Yes.\n12                 MR. ELY: Oh, I see.\n13                 MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, it's - - we intend - -\n14 this cutoff wall is being designed in such a fashion\n15 that we're still going to be able to build the subdeck\n16 while the freeze wall stands there.\n17                 MR. ELY: I gotcha.\n18                 MR. ANDERSON: So even that freeze wall,\n19 what we are going to do is when it comes time to do the\n20 excavation, we'll do all of the excavation that we need\n21 to do on it. And then eventually, divers are going to\n22 go down and they are going to cut through the sheeting\n23 off-\n24                 MR. ELY: (Inaudible) or whatever.\n25                 MR. ANDERSON: Yeah, a couple of feet\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0008\n\f                                                               9\n1    below the mud line, and we're going to cut the sheeting\n2    wall down. All right. And then in that, we're then\n3    going to cut the outer casing of the pile and be right\n4    back to what we need.\n5                   MR. ELY: Could you back fill that casing\n6    with some kind of hard material that - -\n7                   MR. ANDERSON: Sure. I mean, we --\n8                   MR. ELY: Lean concrete or something.\n9                   MR. ANDERSON: I was going to say we can\n10 pour - - we can pour concrete in the casing for all that\n11 matters, in order to fill that void up. That would be\n12 a no-brainer. We could easily do that.\n13                  MR. ELY: Okay. That's something our\n14 Geotech will have to look at.\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: And we're not done on the\n16 calculations, but I wanted to give you a head's-up.\n17 Jerry, did you want me to show you what it - -\n18                  MR. FARHAT: Okay. Maybe --\n19                  MR. ANDERSON: - - what we're going to do\n20 is this (inaudible). We're looking at if this is the\n21 freeze wall here, and we have the wharf face here, and\n22 of course we have the piles here, and then we have B\n23 row that sits in through here. All right. The bin\n24 wall that we're talking about building is actually\n25 shaped about like this, and runs all the way back to H\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   0008.0009\n\f                                                                   10\n1    row, all right, and cut off here. What this does is,\n2    this ties up into the freeze wall in this fashion which\n3    gives it its stability.\n4                 This is the piling that is in question right\n5    here. And what we want to do is, we want to put an\n6    outer casing around that piling to allow this bin wall\n7    to deflect as as needed. Because eventually, when this\n8    is all excavated out, of course you've got this - -\n9    you've got soil - - the worst case is when we've\n10 excavated this side, and you haven't excavated this\n11 side, and you have all this pressure of the soil laying\n12 against this bin wall.\n13                All right. So this whole thing is going to be\n14 frozen, along with this. Eventually, what we would have\n15 here is in the slope matrix, you've got the B row piling\n16 that goes down here with the deck up above it. The\n17 sheathing is going to be installed in the freeze wall at\n18 this level. It's going to be well under the deck by\n19 several feet. And this casing will more than likely\n20 come into play in here, just enough depth to be able to\n21 protect it from the deflection. Because once we get\n22 into the soil, the bin wall is not going to move.\n23                You know, once you get into the soil, the soil\n24 is going to act as shoring to hold it in place anyway.\n25 The deflection is going to occur primarily at close to\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        0008.0010\n\f                                                                 11\n1    the top.\n2                  MR. FARHAT: Do you have only one bin\n3    wall or just so many of them?\n4                  MR. ANDERSON: Just one. All this is is\n5    that in the complete matrix of the freeze wall what\n6    we've done now - - it used to be that the freeze wall was\n7    going to end at this point. But now, with this 330-foot\n8    extension, it's going to be extended out. Under our\n9    current schedule, we have to finish the entire subdeck\n10 before I can breach the freeze wall to bring the ship\n11 in. It doesn't work if I got another three or four\n12 months' worth of work. So at about - - at about the 900\n13 foot mark, at this point, we are going to put the cutoff\n14 wall so that I can take this freeze wall out when\n15 necessary, whenever we're there.\n16                 MR. McKENNEY: You're going to drive that\n17 casing in first and then drill it in?\n18                 MR. ANDERSON: Well, I think we'll drive\n19 _.. we're probably gonna end up drilling it.\n20                 MR. ELY: No, we can't drive it. Our\n21 permit doesn't allow it.\n22                 MR. ANDERSON: No, we can drive it.\n23                 MR. ELY: You can?\n24                 MR. ANDERSON: There's nothing in the\n25 permit that says I can't drive it .\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0011\n\f                                                                12\n1                  MR. ELY: Really? Okay.\n2                  MR. ANDERSON: In fact, the sheeting - -\n3    it's about two days' worth of work to drive the\n4    sheeting, so there's going to be a myriad of phone calls\n5    and complaints and bitches while we are doing this for\n6    two days. And then you guys can yell at me and slap my\n7    hand and say bad contractor, and I say, okay, we won't\n8    do it anymore. But - -\n9                  MR. THIESS: Well, the only thing is, I\n10 remember when the GeoEngineers were talking about this\n11 at the Port, they said that they might lose like 5 to 10\n12 percent shear strength on the soil. So we might\n13 just have to make that B row pile a little deeper, huh?\n14                 MR. ELY: There's going to be - - some\n15 more discussion is going to occur, because the testing\n16 that they've done shows there's no degradation after\n17 that cycle.\n18                 MR. THIESS: Oh, really?\n19                 MR. ELY: But, you know, nobody is sure\n20 if they believe that yet, so...\n21                 MR. ANDERSON: Okay. One of the things\n22 we had talked about is taking that one particular piling\n23 another 10, 20 feet deeper in order to pick up that skin\n24 friction. And if that's what it's going to take for you\n25 guys to get comfortable with it, I have no problem,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     0008.0012\n\f                                                               13\n1    we'll take it down another 20 feet, you know, just to\n2    get it. How much end bearings do you have on these\n3    pilings? What percentage of end bearings on it?\n4                   MR. FARHAT: Oh, I don't know. They may\n5    be 40 percent end bearing. I have to check.\n6                   MR. ANDERSON: Because, you know, as we\n7    Get deeper in there, that soil becomes much, much more\n8    stable, and you're going to pick up some additional end\n9    bearing if I take it another 20, 30 feet, plus the\n10 additional skin friction. Okay? So I just - - like I\n11 said, this is just the first blush to give you an idea\n12 of what's coming when we give you the - - when we get\n13 this pricing together for the 330-footer, that - -\n14                  MR. THIESS: It's going to include that.\n15                  MR. ANDERSON: - - it's going to include\n16 the cost of this. RKK is already working on the\n17 engineering calculations and stuff to be able to make\n18 sure that we're not - - that this piling is not going to\n19 cause us a problem. All right.\n20                  MR. THIESS: So what we will have is\n21 stamped engineering on that pile.\n22                  MR. ANDERSON: Yes, yes.\n23                  MR. THIESS: Okay.\n24                  MR. McKENNEY: If he drills that in\n25 there, how's Bobby gonna have - - is he going to still\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    0008.0013\n\f                                                                   14\n1    have a 36 inch shaft?\n2                       MR. ANDERSON: He's going to set another\n3    casing inside the - - yes. It will be a double-cased\n4    pile.\n5                       MR. ELY: Just make sure when they do\n6    that, when they do the analysis, make sure they include\n7    the stiffness of the shaft - -\n8                       MR. ANDERSON: Okay.\n9                       MR. ELY: Because I mean, a lot of times\n10 what people will do is, they go down and say, oh, the\n11 deflection is pretty small down here, so we're not\n12 going to include that. But make sure they include that\n13 stiffness. Because even a small deflection below ground\n14 will cause a lot of stress in concrete piles.\n15                      MR. ANDERSON: Yes. Yeah, we're going to\n16 take the casing probably down to the relief point. And\n17 it - - itisn't - -\n18                      MR. ELY: The (inaudible) point you mean?\n19 Well, okay (inaudible.)\n20                      MR. ANDERSON: Yes, yes. And I don't\n21 believe that the point is going to be very deep into the\n22 soil, because it's pretty damned stiff as you start\n23 dropping down to that level. Remember, in the B row\n24 piling, we're actually into that 45-foot sand strata,\n25 all right, and that's going to give us some pretty good\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        0008.0014\n\f                                                                 15\n1    holding force.\n2                     MR. THIESS: Okay. All right. Anyone\n3    else? Is that it, Andy? Is there anything else?\n4    Anyone else comments on the wharf? I have one comment\n5    I'd like to - - we have one outstanding submittal on the\n6    welding. And it's for - - for the wharfside for the\n7    supplies. The QC or the welding rod, electrodes, we need\n8    to get that and finish out. Otherwise you're not - -\n9    you're not 100 percent passing your welding - -\n10                    MR. ANDERSON: What do you need, just the\n11 (Inaudible) the rods?\n12                    MR. THIESS: No, we need the QC\n13 procedures, the dry control box, the storage - -\n14                    MR. ANDERSON: Oh, oh. Yeah, yeah.\n15 Gotcha.\n16                    MR. THIESS: Like to have that. Okay.\n17 That's it. If no one else has anything on the wharf,\n18 we'll move to the container yard.\n19                    (End of requested portion of\n20                    Construction Coordination Meeting.)\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      0008.0015\n\f                                                                     16\n\n 1 ,STATE OF TEXAS)\n 2   COOPt OF     HARRIS)\n 3        ~            REPORTER'S CERTIFICATE\n 4     ~I, ~L.

Projected increases in demand ft:rr containerized\n                 cargo will require two 1,000-foot berths at terminal opening. Exte:-:ding the wharf 332 feet under the\n                 current contract is feasible and wm assure the reQuired berths are available. Construction of the\n                 extension can only be conducted within lhe schedule by the present Wharf and Dredging contractor\n                 because of construction structures currently in place which cannot be removed or relocated withou1\n                 adversely affecting on-going wharf construction.. Additionally, the current contractor's unique method\n                 of construction is the only practicable means of achieving strict emissions requirements for this\n                 contrac1. The contractor has submitted a proposal in the estimated amount of $12,962,800 for the 332\n                 root wharf extension. The Engineering Department and the Phase 1A Program Manager have\n                 reviewed the contraclo(s proposal and found it to be fair and reasonable.\n\n                 It is therefore recommended that the Por1 Commission at its July 25, 2t1()5 meeting authorize a change\n                 order in the estimated amount of $12,962.800 to the Zachry Construction Corporation contract for\n                 Bayport T enninal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging and that such action further au1horize the\n                 Executive Director to do any and alllhings in his opinion reasonable or necessary to g..:Ye effect to the\n                 foregoing.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                   006.016.033.Z6Z\n\n                                                                            V.LM.CJL.tk                             PHA 0014992\n                                                                           ExHIBIT NO.\\~~\n\n                                                                           Jo... 1q -o 7 :::J1.f\n\n                                                                                                                                 No. 2006-72970\n                                                                                                                                ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                                     224\n\n                                                                                                                                             0224.0001\n\f...   -: ·. :·      ,·· ·\n\n ·'\nJ'\n                                        •                                     •\n                              Change Order to Zacllry ConstnJ<;tlon Corporation for-\n                    Bayport TenninaJ Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging-Wharf Extension\n\n                 Dascription:   ·   Staff recommends construction of a 332' wharf extension to the\n                                    current contract.

The remaining eastern portion, as well as the 330-foot extension, will then be\ncompleted after that time with the cutoff wall separating the east and west portions, The cutoff wall will be\ncomprised of a combination of frozen soil and steel sheet piles to provide retention of soil and groundwater\nduring construction and excavation. This wall will then be removed from the final grade up, in the same\nfashion as the primary frozen soil shoring wall that runs east-west in front of the wharf. However, the wharf\ndeck will cover most of the cutoff wall and therefore, wall removal will need to be accomplished in water by\ndivers after both sides are excavated out. As this design is draft and presented to the construction team for\ncomments, some refinement of the details presented herein may be appropriate. A final version, together with\na drafted set of plans will be prepared afler comments from the construction team and Port consu ltants, as\nappropriate: have been incorporated.\n\n                                                   CUTOFF WALL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe cutoff wall 'will be located perpendicular to the wharf at drilled shaft line no. 59.5 (Station ~81+50), as\nshown on the attached plan, Figure 1. Zachry has left this portion of the pile caps and decking open to allow\naccess for installing the cutoff wall. After the cutoff sheet piles and freeze pipe system are in place, Zachry\nwill complete the closure section of tbe decking.\n\nAt its deepest point near A-Line, the cutoff wall \\'\\1.11 need to retain soil and groundwater from the design\nwater level elevation of +8 feet MLL W to the bottom of the excavation (-53 feet Elevation after the keyway is\nbackfilled), for a total free-face height of 61 feet. South of A-Line, the height of the wall will reduce at a rate\nof2H:1V, following the final grade of the slope as shown in Figure 2. The south wall will end about 4 inches\nfrom the from the Il-line piles. The north end will be embedded WIthin the primary frozen soil shoring wall,\n\nThe sheet sheets will be AZ26 steel sections driven to depths ranging from about 6 to 15 feet below the\nbottom of excavation (-9 to 18 feet below the bottom of final grade). The soil in between the two sheets will\nbe frozen using primarily 2 to 3 rows of freeze pipes in the 8-foot-wide wharf area plus additional rows in the\nwider area between the wharf and the primary frozen soil shoring wall.

These freeze pipes will extend\ndown to depths of 80 to 100 feet, as shown on Figure 2 to provide additional lateral support and to cut off\ngroundwater within the dense sand layer encountered in borings between about 55 and 75 feet in depth. The\ntop of the frozen ground in between the steel sheets will be at Elevation +8 feet, the same as the primary\nfrozen soil shoring wall. The top of the steel sheets will be at Elevation +9 feet, one foot above the soil\ninside, to provide a buffer from waves and to contain brine manifold lines. A whaler consisting of a W12x79\nsection will be attached to the top of the wall. Steel Lies located just below the ground surface and spaced at 8\nfeet on center will be installed through the two sheets and whaler to provide a positive connection of the two\nsheets at the top. A detail cross section at the top of the wall is shown in Figure 4.\n\n                                        ENGINEERING ANALYSIS\n\nOne of the key elements of til is design is to limit the horizontal wall deformation, and therefore deformation\nof the soil retained behind it, to a small amount such that this movement will not adversely affect the\nstructural integrity of the drilled shafts that support the wharf. 1\\ second key element is to limit the growth of\nthe frozen soil such that it does not freeze these same drilled shafts.\n\nWe completed dozens of thermal and structural finite-element analyses to evaluate the expected deformation\nof the frozen soil/sheet pile cutoff wall. To optimize the thermal aspects, we used TEMP/W, a 2D finite\nelement thermal model program. To evaluate the deformation of the wall under various loading conditions,\nwe used both 2D and 3D versions of PLAXIS, a finite element soil/structure model. The 2D TEMP/Wand\nthe 2D PLAXIS programs are discussed in more detail in our report for tile primary frozen soil shoring wall,\ndated February 4, 2005. The cutoff wall is a high, wide, stiff structural element that is essentially fixed at\neach end (the frozen soil shoring wall at the north and the slope at the south). Without the embedment at the\nwall ends, our 2D analyses indicate that wall horizontal movement after one side is excavated in the dry will\nlikely be excessive. The end effects of this wall can only be evaluated using a 3D model as discussed in a\nsubsequent section.\n\nTHERMAL ANALYSES\n\nWe analyzed numerous freeze pipe layouts and brine temperatures using TEMP/W to evaluate the impact on\n1) the average temperature of the soil within the steel sheets and 2) the extent of frozen soil into the ground\nrelative to the wharf piles. The two goals are opposite. Colder brine and more freeze pipes freezes the soil\ncolder, which results in stronger and stiffer ground and very small wall movements, however, frozen soil\nextends outward past the sheets over 5 feet, the approximate distance to the wharf piles, after 3 or 4 months of\nfreezing. Warmer brine and less freeze pipes and limits the extent of frozen ground so that it does not reach\nthe existing wharf piles, however, the frozen soil is less strong and wall movements will increase. Our\nthermal analyses were completed to optimize the freeze system to satisfy both constraints.\n\nOur analyses indicate that the optimal layout of freeze pipes is as shown approximately on Figure 5. These\nresults from TE\\1P/W show a close-up view of an 8-fa or-wide section of wall beneath the wharf that includes\nseven freeze pipes, the steel sheet and one of the existing drilled shafts. The overall layout of freeze pipes is\nshown in Figure I and includes freeze pipe locations in the wider zone of the wall north of tile wharf. Most of\nthe 8-foot section has 2 rows of freeze pipes spaced at ~4 feet (4. J 3 feet = I per 2 AZ26 sheets) that extend\ndown 80 to 100 feet in depth to cut off groundwater in the dense sand and provide adequate structural\nstability. Five extra freeze pipes are to be installed as a third row in tbe highest P3.1.t of the wall between A\nand D lines. Our plan is to freeze down the soil in between the freeze pipes as quickly as practical using cold\nbrine in all three rows of freeze pipes. After 2 months or so of freezing, the outside rows will be maintained\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                           ZCC-40-009167\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                     0010.0002\n\fMemorandum to Larry Applegate(SoiIFreeze) and Charles Rogers (Zachry)\nSeptember 9,2005\nPage 3\n\n\nto about +20F while the inside row is maintained at -20F. This limits frozen soil growth to more than 1 foot\nfrom the wharf piles after 6 months of freeze, as shown in Figure 5. The extent of frozen ground is\nprogressively less with less time of freezing. To accomplish this zoned type of freeze control, SoilFreeze will\nneed to install two separate freezing systems for this wall. The colder freeze section will be applied to those\nfreeze pipes encircled on Figure 1. The single black dots on Figure I represent pipes connected to a variable\nfreeze system. The average ground temperature inside the sheet piles is maintained below 20F, even in the\nwanner freeze section, which is needed to provide sufficient wall stiffness and strength, discussed more in the\nfollowing section.\n\nSome modification of the brine temperatures will be needed during the project, the extent of which will\ndepend on the specific ground response to freezing. As with the primary wall, ground temperatures will be\nmonitored throughout the process so that we can change the brine temperatures as appropriate to maintain\ncold temperatures inside the cutoff wall while limiting frozen soil growth outside.\n\nAfter the first (west) side of the wharf is excavated, the west side of the sheet pile wall will be exposed. At\nthis time it will be necessary to spray the surface of the steel with foam insulation. Tile insulation is needed to\nprevent the soil inside the wall from melting when this west side is filled with water.\n\nP~SSTRUCTURALANALYSES\n\nThe frozen soil temperatures obtained from TEMP/W, discussed above, were used to obtain frozen soil\nstrength and stiffness values for use as input to PLAXlS 3D. 1110 problem is quite complex to model and\nrequired nearly 10,000 elements as illustrated in Figure 6, which represents the 3D grid for this analysis. We\ncompleted several dozen computers run varying wall geometry, frozen soil strength, sheet pile sections and\nother variables in order to develop a solution that results in little wall movement and moderate wall thickness\nand depth. We also performed a series of 2D PLAXIS analyses to evaluate the relationship between wall/soil\nmovement and the impact on the drilled shafts. These:2D analyses indicate that up to about 2 inches of soil\ndeflection near the piles before the onset of plastic hinging. The results of the PLAX1S J D analyses indicate\nthe maximum horizontal wall movement will be on the order of I inch for an eight foot wide wall that utilizes\nAZ26 sections embedded as shown in Figure 2. This results in a factor of safety against plastic hinging of 2.\nThis deformation estimate is considered to be a conservative estimate because we did not include the positive\neffect of the numerous concrete piles or the whaler on reducing soil movement in our modeling. Based on\nthese analyses, it is our opinion that the cutoff wall should retain soil and groundwater after excavation on one\nside is completed with little wall movement which should not impact the existing wharf piles.\n\nThe cutoff wall is located in between pile rows 59 and 60, which are 20.5 feet apart. The steel sheets will be\nlocated about 5 feet from the wharf piles along these rows. Line B has additional piles so that one of Line B\npiles is located within the cutoff wall, as seen on Figure 1. To reduce the impact of the cutoff wall on this one\npile, we have included a 42\" to 48\" diameter casing to be installed around the Line B pile before the start of\nfreezing. The purpose of the casing is to protect the Line B pile as the wall moves during excavation. If it\nwas embedded in frozen soil, the very rigid cutoff wall movement may exert undue forces on this pile. The\ncollar will extend to the bottom of the excavation. The annulus between the pile and the casing will be\ncleaned out by Zachry and air will remain in the annulus throughout the life of the cutoff walL As the cutoff\nwall moves laterally the estimated 1 inch during excavation, the Line B pile will remain vertical and\nuntouched by the wall within the zone above the excavation depth.\n\n\n\n\n

Jackson\n\nSubject:        Recommendation for Approval of Change Order No. 4 in the Estimated\n                Amount of $12,962,800 to Zachry Construction Corporation for Bayport\n                Terminal Complex Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging                             .\n\nBy Minute 2004-0524-13, the Port Commission awarded a contract in the estimated amount of\n$62,485,733 to Zachry Construction Corporation (ZCC) for Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A\nWharf and Dredging.\n\nThe initial contract provides for a 1,660-foot wharf. Projected increases in demand for\ncontainerized cargo will require two 1·,OOO-foot berths at terminal opening. Extending the wharf\n332 feet under the current contract is feasible and will assure the required berths are available.\nConstruction of the extension can only be conducted within the schedule by the present Wharf\nand Dredging contractor because of construction structures currently in place which cannot be\nremoved or relocated without adversely affecting ongoing wharf construction. Additionally, the\ncurrent contractor's unique method of construction is the only practicable means of achieving\nstrict emissions requirements for this contract. The contractor has submitted a proposal in the\nestimated amount of $12,962,800 forthe 332-foot wharf extension. The Engineering Department\nand the Phase 1A Program Manager have reviewed the contractor's proposal and found it to be\nfair and reasonable.\n\nBy Minute 2005-0725-18, the Port Commission authorized the issuance of a change order in the\nestimated amount of $12,962,800 to Zachry Construction Corporation for the above described\nchanges. Accordingly, please sign the attached change order and return it to the Engineering\nDepartment for further handling.\n\n\n\n\nJBJ/SHD/MV: ~\n\nAttachment\n\nC:      Mr.   Andrew Thless, P.E. - CH2M HILL, Inc.\n        Mr.   Forbes Baker\n        Mr.   James Turner\n        Mr.   Mark Vincent, P.E.\n        Mr.   Jim McQueen, P.E.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             005.010.019069\n\n                                                                                             PHA0012047\n\n\n                                                                                                         0012.0003\n\f                                      SCOPE, TIME,AND PRICE MODIFICATIONS\n                                        TO SPECIFICATIONS AND PROPOSAL\n                                    Bayport Phase 1A Wharf and Dredging Contract\n\n                                            PORT OF HOUSTON AUTHORITY\n                                                       P.

As a result of negotiation, the following\nscope. time. and price modifications were made to Proposer's Specifications and Proposal dated April 13, 2005, as\namended by Proposals for 330 feet Wharf Extension and as further amended by Proposer's Supplemental Proposal dated\nJuly 11, 2005 except Ditch K construction will not be part of this agreemenl\n\n\n1. Contractor shall construct 332 linear feet of Wharf utilizing the same construction methods outlined in the original 1,660\nlinear feet of wharf, for a total price of $12,962,800.\n\n2. The Proposal price includes incorporation of change orders. RFl's to the original 1,660 linear feet of wharf incorporated\nthrough July 25, 2005.\n\n3. PHA will furnish pile depths not later than August 12,2005. PHA shall furnish remaining wharf design documents by\nNovember 25, 2005.\n\n4. Change order includes construction of an additional 332 linear feet of chain link fencing with three-strand anti-climb\nbars installed and, a drainage swell at the East end of the wharf extension to connect 10 the existing drainage, for an\ninclusive cost not to exceed $15.500.\n\n5. The basis of drilled shaft construction is 21,266.5 linear feet of drilled shafts at a unit cost of $82/LF for a total cost not\nto exceed $1,743,853, included in the change order price. Adjustments to shaft length will be made at a rate-of $82 per\nlinear foot of increased shaft length or cost reduction of $43 per linear foot of shaft length reduction.\n\n6. The 332-feel Wharf Exlension Construction and all other components of the contract shall be completed by July 15.\n2006. The interim completion date to accommodate the ship-to-shore crane arrival, as per the original contract is revised\nto February 15, 2006. and the length of wharf available at that time is changed to 850 linear feet, along with associated\ndredging to receive the crane transport vessel. The February 15, 2005 milestone completion date requires that the\npermanent power components as described in the contract documents be provided for the Ship to Shore Cranes. The\noriginal 1660 linear feet of wharf main deck and drilled piers shall be completed by June 1,2006.\n\n7. The contractor's proposal originally assumed only 80,000 cubic yards of dredge malerial. The dredge quantity was\nrevised from 80,000 to 110,000 cubic yards based upon actual survey. The Contractor will dredge and place 110,000\ncubic yards of material in designated disposal areas at a rate of $13.15/cubic yard. for an increase of $1,446.500 inclusive\nin the change order price. Any quantity dredged short of the base quantity of 110,000 cubic yards, the remaining balance\nof the yardage to equal 110,000 cubic yards shall be paid to ZCC at a rate of $ 0.54 per cubic yard. this equals a credit to\nPOHA at a rate of $12.61 per cubic yard on Ihe under dredge quantity. Any quantity dredged in excess of 110,000 cubic\nyards will be paid at the unit rate of $13.15/ cy_\n\n8.

Using the design load {250 tons) and shaft embedment shown on DMJM Harris drawings and the\n                       unfrozen soil strength ·data presented in Geotest's report, we had the program calculate the shaft settlement\n                       and factor of safety (FS) for 4 cases: 1} no soU strength reduction (current condition), 2) 10% strength\n                       reduction, 3) 20% strength reauction and 4) 30\"/0 strength reduction. Keep in mind that the shafts extend\n                       below the bottom of the freezing, so the lower portion wi II not be 1m pacted at all by freezing. To be\n                       conservat.i ve we assumed that the entire soil mass around the shaft between final slope grade and the\n                       10Q-foot depth was frozen and then thaw~, not just up to 1 foot away as shown In our submittal.\n\n                       The results are as follows:\n\n                                CASE                                           FS         Settlement at Design Load\n                       1. No reduction in soil strength                        3.2               0.14D\n                       2. 10% reduction in soil strength                       3.1               0.15\"\n                       3. 20% reduction in soil strength                       2.9               0.16\"\n                       4. 30% reduction in soil strength                       2.5               0.17\"\n\n                       I also calculated the average unfrozen and thawed strength of the clay soil from the Houston Bayport project\n                       from the data presented in our 2125/05 soils report. As it turns out the avera_   ge unfrozen compressive\n                       strength {no freezing) from a total of 3 tests is -7 ksf while the average thawed strength for the same samples\n                       is -9.ksf, which indicates an increase instead of a decrease in strength due to freezing and thawing. This\n                      probably isn't real and is likely due to the natural scatter in soil properties. I would expect that we would see\n                       some minor reduction in the average strength after thawing if we completed lots more of the same type of\n                      tests. A good article was written about affect of freeze-thaw on strength of son by Graham and Au in 1985.\n                      From many tests, they found that the strength reduction of silt (very similar to our clay) is about 3b<'lo after 5\n                      freeze-thaw cycles. Unfortunately, they did not do a test after just one f~eeze-thaw cycle {like we will have at\n                      this project) which should show a higher strength than soil exposed to 5 freeze-thaw cycles. After talking\n                      with Dave Sego, other researchers have found similar results. We also have dense sand at depth. The effect\n                      of freeze-thaw on the strength of sand is typically less than on clay because of the fact that the sand generally\n                      does not develop much ice formation. Based on all this information, we may see no more than about a 10%\n                      to 15% reduction in overall strength for the Houston Bayport soil, in my opinion.\n\n                      Assuming a conservative 15% strength reduction in the soil after thawing and considering the results from\n                      PLAXIS shown above, it appears that even if we freeze all the soil around the drilled shafts (not just up to 1\n                      foot away) we will only see a minor reduction in the factor of safety (3.2 to 3.0) and virtually no increase in\n                      shaft settlement. From this information, it looks to me as if we really don't need to worry too much about\n                      freezing the soil around the shafts.\n.... ··:..\n\n                      DISCL'.IMER: Any electronic form, facsimile Of hard copy of the original document          (J--------.,).if provided, and any\n                      attachments we only a copy of the llfiginal document The original document is                     ~                             an:!   wm serve as   the\n                      official document or rElC()fd.                                                                    ~\n\n                                                                                                                       EXHIBIT NO• .fll\n                                                                                                                       II ~o' -6 7 .:r I-f\n                                                                                                                                                                P- FIP.015421\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                  0014.0001\n\f                          ...........·   .....                .. .

ZCC's submittal for the cutoff wall, however, indicates freezing of soil as close as one foot\n                from as many as 14 piles, which is inside the zone of soil that has structural impact on the\n                friction resistance of the piles. However, preliminary Indications are that the design may have\n                an indeterminate affect on a significant number of nearby shafts which may present\n                unacceptable risk to the Port of Houston.\n                Contractor must present alternative cutoff wall design, such as a cellular sheet pile wall or\n                grout wall, that provides the desired cutoff effect with.less risk to the structural integrity of the\n                wharf. Or the contractor may present the Port of Houston with an altemate means of\n                mitigating risk to the structural integrity of the wharf.\n  Primary       Revise and Resubmit\n  Response\n  Submission\n  Notes\n\n\n Dates\n\n Material                                       Required Lead Time (days}\n Required on\n Site\n Approved                                       Required Review Time (days)        20\n Submittal\n Required By\n Submission\n Due\n\n\n  Linked Documents\n\n  Document Type          Document                            Description                               Date\n  Doc                    C70-1A-D01-01636                                                             9/12/2005\n\n\n                                                                           No. 2006-72970\n                                                                        ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                    ZCC-EXP-0000073\n                                                                             266\n                                                                                                                        0266.0001\n\fDistribution\n\n    Recipient                 Company                             Method               Date\nCharles Rogers   Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email: rogersc@zachry.com        10/11/2005\nDavid Griffin    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email : griffindg@zachry.com     10/11/2005\nDavid Griffin    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Message                          10/11/2005\nJeff Ely         CH2M HILL                           Email: jelyl@ch2m.com             9/14/2005\nJeff Ely         CH2M HI LL                          Message                           9/14/2005\nRich Kl assen    Zachry Construction   Corporation   Message                          10/11/2005\nRich Klassen     Zachry Construction   Corporation   Email: andersonhe@zachry.com     10/11/2005\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    ZCC-EXP-0000074\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   0266.0002\n\f                TAB 34\n\n     Transcript of October 11, 2005\nWeekly Construction Coordination Meeting\n                (PX314)\n\f1                  IN THE JUDICIAL DISTRICT COURT OF\n                        HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS\n2\n3    ZACHRY CONSTRUCTION           )\n     CORPORATION,                  )\n4                                  )\n              Plaintiff,           )\n5                                  )\n     V.                            )\n6                                  )\n     PORT OF HOUSTON               )      CAUSE NO.\n7    AUTHORITY,                    )      2006-72970\n                                   )\n8             Defendant.           )\n                                   )\n9                                  )\n                                   )\n10                                 )\n11\n12\n13\n14\n             Weekly Construction Coordination Meeting\n15\n                      Date: October 11, 2005\n16\n                      Minutes: 08:40- 13:29\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n                                                         No. 2006-72970\n                                                        ZCC EXHIBIT\n                                                           314\n\f         2\n          1 Audio Reporting Transcribed by:\n          2\n          3    JENNIFER HAYNIE\n               ALPHA REPORTING CORPORATION\n          4    236 Adams Avenue\n               Memphis, Tennessee 38103\n          5    901.523.8974\n          6\n          7\n               Proper names and inaudibles or undiscernible\n          8 testimony was provided Andy Anderson.\n          9\n         10\n         11\n         12\n         13\n         14\n         15\n         16\n         17\n         18\n         19\n         20\n         21\n         22\n         23\n         24\n         25\n\n.;:\n~·\n\n·:,'..\n\f                                                           3\n     1 Date:     October 11, 2005\n     2 Minutes: 8:40 - 13:29\n     3    (Requested portion of Weekly Construction\n     4           Coordination Meeting.)\n     5          ANDY THIESS: Then the pile\n:·   6 redesign for the cut off wall.

Now, the\n     10 answer to this it says that the contractor --\n     11 first of aU, this says \"no, resubmit. 11 All\n     12 right. There's a number of avenues to go here.\n     13 Number one, they ask for an alternative cutoff\n     14 such as a ceUular sheet pile wall. There is a\n     15 cellular sheet pile wall between the freeze pipe\n     16 and the piles. That's the cut off wall. That's\n     17 the structure.\n     18          ANDY THIESS: I understand.\n     19          ANDY ANDERSON: I don't think they\n     20 understand.\n     21          ANDYTHIESS: No. Theyunderstand.\n     22          ANDY ANDERSON: Well, then what are they\n     23 talking about? The freeze pipes are contained\n     24 within the sheet pile wall.\n     25          ANDY THIESS: They're talking about\n\f4\n1 a cellular meaning like a honeycomb structure.\n2 Some sort of structural sheet pile wall.\n3           ANDY ANDERSON: Okay. Now, we get\n4 it.\n5           JOHN GLASGOW: Then we don't have to\n6 freeze it.\n7           ANDYTHIESS: Correct.\n8           JIM MCQUEEN: Yeah. Yeah. That's\n9 the concem.\n10          ANDY THIESS: Or slurry or soil\n11 cement or any other -- any other method of\n12 putting in this wall that is not such a high\n13 risk to the structure.\n14          JOHN GLASGOW: DanMageau was\n15 supposed to be here today, right?\n16           CHARLES RODGERS: Tomorrow.\n17          JOHN GLASGOW Tomorrow. And Corey\n18 was going to bring that up with him and see if it\n19 willfly.\n20          ANDY ANDERSON: We will look at it, but two things.\n21 Number one, if we want to accept the\n22 risk. It's not -- it's not a submittal. It\n23 is for information purposes only, okay, and\n24 number two, our price is predicated on current\n25 construction methods and that was clearly\n\f                                                         5\n1 defined. Now, chances are based on the price\n2 of this goddamn cut off wall you know, we can design\n3 something and stay within the parameters of what\n4 we got.\n5           ANDY THIESS: That's all the Port's\n6 asking for.\n7           ANDY ANDERSON: And we will look at that,\n8 and we need to look at it very, very quickly.\n9           ANDY THIESS: But I think ify'all\n10 design something alternate, if it can be done,\n11 it will be real easy--\n12          JIM MCQUEEN: I want you to\n13 understand the spirit of this whole thing is\n14 that we -- the problem is that it jeopardizes\n15 some footings on either side, piers on\n16 either side.\n17          There's a possibility of that, okay,\n18 and there's a tisk. We know that you guys are\n19 taking that, but we're not-- we're not\n20 necessarily sure that we want you to take that. .\n21 There's a lot of concern and we're not rejecting\n22 it all together as we're not going to do it.\n23 We're still throwing money at evaluation, but we\n24 would like to know if there's another\n25 alternative.\n\f6\n 1          ANDY ANDERSON: We'll look at it. I\n 2 half way looked at a bin wall early on in this,\n 3 but to be quite honest with you, I looked at a\n 4 bin wall for replacement of the freeze wall\n 5 itself Not the cut off wall. The problem was\n 6 in the freeze wall was that the soil has no\n 7 abiJity to handle the stress of the bin wall.\n 8 It would just collapse.\n 9          Now, the cut off wall is something a little\n10 something different, you know, and I need to\n11 look at that. The problem I see with that is we\n12 still have to design it so that it runs between\n13 the piles and does not encase the pile row because\n14 I'm worried about the lateral movement of the\n15 wall when pressure is relived on one side and I\n16 don't want to side load these piles.\n17          At any rate, a semicircular cell\n18 possibly could work. Now I have to, you fucking ruined my\n19 whole a:ftemoon, now I'll have to sit down and .. .\n20          .TIM MCQUEEN: Because we heard you\n21 were out playing golf.\n22          ANDY ANDERSON: That's tomon·ow. But\n23 we'll look at it and see what we can do on it,\n24 but I want to caution-- the designers need to\n25 understand that this is not a submittal that\n\f                                                             7\n     1 requires approval, and we are worlcing with you and\n     2 we'll come up with something else.\n     3          JIM MCQUEEN: We understand, or at\n     4 least I understand, and the latter part too, the\n     5 cost issue.\n     6          ANDY ANDERSON: I do not want to\n     7 have to have to readdress that issue.\n     8          JIM MCQUEEN:       rm not-- no one\n     9 in our... but we just want you to look.\n     10         ANDY ANDERSON: I will look at it\n     11 very hard. Luckily Mageau is going to be here\n     12 tomorrow so we may actually be able get\n     13 something resolved quickly.

Based on designer input prior to design\nof the original freeze wall, it was expected that the cutoff wall would be designed in a way to avoid\ncompromising any piers by freezing, except for one pier in Row B that was identified by ZCC beforehand.\nThe original freeze wall design accomodated a 6 feet setback from the nearest piers as requested by the\ndesigners. Potential freezing of piers resulting in loss of load capacity is the basis for PHA concerns\nregarding the cutoff wall design. These concerns have not been adequately addressed in the cutoff wall\nsubmittal.\n\nI think it would be a good idea to include this in your memo. Zachry has implied that they believe our review\nand rejection of the cutoff wall design is a breach of their change order contract, as they told us there would\nbe a cutoff wall. They believe this gives them a claim for time. We need to make the point that we\nanticipated it being designed according to the criteria of the original freezed wall. Otherwise we will have to\nstate this separately in another letter.\n\n\n\nFrom: Ely, Jeff/HOU\nSent: Friday, November 11,20052:49 PM\nTo: James McQueen; Mark Vincent; Farhat, Jerry; Thiess, AndrewjHOU; Johnson, Robert/HOU\nee: Emsley, Laurence/HOU\nSubject: cutofCwalLresponse.doc\n\n All:\n Please provide any comments by COB Monday, November 14.

Management Plan (CMP) is to provide the framework for\nconstruction management consistency, continuity, quality control, timeliness and teamwork\nfor successful completion of Phase 1A of the Port of Houston Authority's (PHA) Bayport\nTerminal Complex.\nThe CMP will outline common procedures to be utilized by the Construction Management\nTeam (CMT), which consists of CH2M HILL Program and Construction Management (CM)\nstaff, PHA representatives, contractors and the Designers of Record (DOR) for the Phase 1A\nconstruction contracts. The CMP will be the reference document providing continuity for\nall CMT members involved in Phase 1A construction. It will define the construction\ncontracts' specific quality assurance requirements, consolidate current construction\nmanagement field policy for easy reference and retrieval, and outline the relationships of\nthe various functions to be performed by the CMT members. The CMT members will use\nthe CMP as a guidance document to ensure Phase 1A of the Bayport terminal complex is\nbuilt to the highest available standards of quality and in accordance with the general and\ntechnical provisions of each Phase 1A contract.\n\n\n1.2 Project Description\nCH2M HILL is providing Program and Construction Management services to PHA for the\ninitial development phase of the estimated $1.2 billion Bayport Terminal Complex. The Port\nof Houston is the busiest port origination/ destination on the United States Gulf. The Port is\nthe world's sixth largest port and is the number one u.s port in foreign tonnage,\ntransshipping more than 150 million tons of cargo annually. At ultimate build-out, the\nBayport Terminal Complex will be the largest container transshipment facility in the United\nStates and include inter-modal rail transfer facilities, cruise terminals and associated\ncommercial developments supporting both the container and cruise terminals.\nCH2M HILL acts as the Port's primary contact for the initial project development phase,\nproviding oversight, communication and coordination for multiple facility design and\nconstruction contracts. Phase lA, the initial development, consists of the design and\nconstruction of 1,660 linear feet of reinforced concrete container wharf supported by\nreinforced concrete drilled piers; reinforced concrete tangent bulkhead wall;\naccess/berthing dredging and on-site disposal of dredged materials; clearing, grubbing and\nearthwork; heavy duty reinforced concrete and asphalt paved container handling, storage\nand transfer yard; signage and pavement markings; electrical substation, transmission and\ndistribution utilities; elevated water storage tank, fire and potable water transmission and\ndistribution lines; storm water drainage lines and storm water pollution prevention\nfacilities; sanitary sewer, pumping station and force mains; site lighting; site\nsecurity/monitoring, fire alarm/ detection, communications and electronic data utilities;\ntemporary and Amenities buildings; and associated construction activities.\n\n                                                             2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 0057.0007\n\f    2.0 Staffing Plan\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n                        0057.0008\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n2.1      Project Organization\nThe Bayport Terminal Complex Phase 1A CMT will serve as the construction administration\nand management representatives for PHA. The CMT, in this role, will coordinate all\nconstruction activities and services required for the successful completion of Phase 1A\nconstruction. The on-site CM Field Staff will consist of a Construction Manager (CM), an\nOffice Engineer, a Lead Inspector, and Civil/Structural/Electrical Inspectors. This staff will\nbe provided by CH2M HILL and its sub-consultants. The CMT also includes PHA project\nmanagement and construction administration staff; Designers of Record (DaR) for each\nconstruction contract; CH2M HILL construction administrative and technical support staff;\nPHA construction materials testing firms; and any other involved parties performing\nconstruction related activities and services.\nThe CM will report directly to PHA's Bayport Project Manager, Chief Engineer, Project\nEngineer, and Chief Inspector as well as the CH2M HILL Program Manager (PM). The CM\nwill coordinate and oversee the daily activities of the CM Field Staff, 3rd party testing\nlaboratory personnel, 3rd party surveyors, 3rd party inspectors and auditors, and other\nCMT members involved in the construction work. The CM is directly responsible for the\ncoordination and oversight of the CM Field Staff.\nThe CMT organizational chart is shown on Attachment 1, \"Construction Management Team\nOrganizational Chart.\" The individual roles and responsibilities of the CM Field Staff are\nshown on Attachment 2, \"CM Field Staff Responsibilities Matrix.\"\n\n\n2.2 Construction Manager\nThe CM shall act as the PHA's representative on site during construction of Phase 1A. The\nCM shall be the Inspector for the work and have all authority delegated to the Inspector by\nthe contract documents. The CM will coordinate the activities of all contractors and DOR\nperforming work on site during Phase 1A construction, and will be responsible for\nimplementation of the Staffing Plan, Communications Plan, Field Work Plan, Quality\nAssurance Plan, Risk Mitigation Plan, and Closeout Plan as described in this CMP.\n\n         2.2.1 Construction Manager Level of Authority\n         As an extension of the PHA staff, the CM will have all authority normally attributed\n         to a CM acting as owner's agent (not at risk) on a construction project. The CM will\n         have the authority to inspect, monitor and control activities on the project site as\n         necessary to protect PHA's liability with regard to project scope, schedule, quality,\n         security, and permit compliance, in accordance with industry-standard practice.\n\n         The CM will not have any authority to make changes to any provisions of the PHA-\n         Contractor construction contract documents in regard to costs (increase or decrease\n         in contract price); time for completion (accelerated or extended contract completion\n\n                                                            4\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                 0057.0009\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n         time); or quality of in-place work (lessen or increase the contract quality\n         requirements for construction materials and/ or workmanship).\n\n         The CM will have the authority to control communications and documentation\n         contributing to the permanent project record, clarify and interpret construction\n         contract documents, and make on-site field administrative/ engineering/ quality\n         assurance decisions, subject to the limitations outlined above. The CM will promote\n         harmonious communication, cooperation and coordination between all contractors\n         and construction activities. The CM will investigate on-site field\n         deficiencies/ discrepancies/ problems and resolve them, if no changes to the\n         construction contract cost, time for completion and/ or construction materials and/ or\n         workmanship are required. If the resolution of an on-site field\n         deficiency/discrepancy/problem requires a change to the contract cost, time for\n         completion and/ or quality of construction materials and/ or workmanship, the CM\n         will investigate and make recommendations to the Port of Houston Authority's\n         Chief Engineer for resolution.\n\n         The CM will provide no direction related to the Contractor's construction means,\n         methods, procedures, safety, sequencing and/ or techniques. The CM will observe\n         and report on the Contractor's construction safety, workmanship and materials, as it\n         relates to quality assurance and the in-place construction work being in conformance\n         with Construction Contract Documents (CCD) (i.e., construction contract General\n         and Special Conditions, drawings, technical specification sections and approved\n         Contractor submittals).\n\n\n2.3 Lead Inspector\nThe Lead Inspector will be responsible for the construction documentation and quality\nassurance of multiple construction contracts awarded for Phase lA. The Lead Inspector will\nreport to the CM and will oversee and direct the work efforts of the Inspectors. The Lead\nInspector will be expected to maintain complete, up-to-date and detailed knowledge of all\npertinent construction contract documents; administrative and technical submittals; change\norders; field orders; progress schedules; drawings; plans; technical specifications; and\nadministrative status reports. The Lead Inspector will observe and monitor the contractors'\nplanning and execution of the work and perform quality assurance inspections of materials\nand workmanship to assure compliance with the CCD. The Lead Inspector will act as\nliaison between the contractors, Inspectors and PHA's construction inspection and materials\ntesting personnel. The Lead Inspector will be responsible for the use and implementation of\nPersonal Digital Assistants (PDA's) for field inspection activities; use of the proprietary\nAssure-It database for analysis and reporting of QA/QC data; preparation of daily, weekly,\nand monthly construction progress reports; making recommendations on contractors'\nprogress payment requests and invoices; maintaining a daily log and photos of the\ncontractors' construction activities, staffing, equipment, and materials; documenting\ncontractor performance and safety issues; and resolving on-site construction conflicts.\n                                                            5\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                  0057.0010\n\fBAYPORT TERMINAL COMPLEX PHASE 1ACONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT PLAN\n\n\n\n\n         4.28.3 Phase 1A Milestone Schedule\n         The CM Field Staff will create and maintain an overall Phase lA Milestone Schedule\n         based on the Contractors' approved baseline Progress Schedules.\n\n         The CM will use the contractors' accepted Progress Schedule Updates to update the\n         Phase lA Milestone Schedule on a monthly basis, or more frequently, as requested\n         by the PHA.\n\n\n4.29 Spare Parts\nCM Field Staff will take possession of all spare parts to be provided by construction\ncontractors, in accordance with the requirements of the project CCD. Contractors will tag\n(CH2M HILL Standard Spare Parts Identification Tag-Form No. 399) all spare parts to be\nturned over to the CM Field Staff. This turnover action will be documented (CH2M HILL\nStandard Spare Parts Transfer Form-Form No. 289) by the contractor and CM Field Staff.\nCM Field Staff will prepare and maintain a record (CH2M HILL Standard Spare Parts\nTransfer Log-Form No. 404) of all spare parts transfers.\n\n\n4.30 Submittals\nThe Contractor for each Phase lA construction contract will be responsible for developing a\nlist of submittals required by the CCD. Submittals lists will be reviewed by the CM for\ncompleteness. A static electronic copy of each Submittal List will be posted in\nConstructware®.\nAll submittals requiring action to be taken by a reviewing/ approving party will be\nsubmitted by the contractor (PHA General Conditions Section 5.20 \"Submittals to be\nFurnished by the Contractor after Award\") to the CM using Constructware®. The\nContractor will be responsible for following any electronic submittal with hard copy\nmaterials, if any, sent to the appropriate party for review.\nThe CM will distribute these submittals to the appropriate reviewing party. Once the\nreviewing party has reviewed, approved or indicated the actions to be taken by the\ncontractor to obtain approval, the submittal will be returned to the contractor through the\nCM. The reviewing party will electronically annotate all reviewed contractor submittals,\nindicating action(s) to be taken by the contractor: no exception taken; make corrections\nnoted; rejected; revise and resubmit; or submit specified item. The review notation will\ninclude places for the reviewer's electronic signature and date of signature.\nInformational submittals will also be submitted by the contractor through the CM in the\nsame manner as described above.\nThe CM Field Staff will document, distribute, file and log all submittals using\nConstructware®.\n                                                            28\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                              0057.0033\n\f             TAB 40\n\nCourt’s Ruling on Directed Verdict\n             (71:8-15)\n\f                                                              8\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   denied.\n\n 2                    MS. YEATES:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:    Now, would you give me a\n\n 4   moment with respect to Zachry's motion?       I just want to\n\n 5   make a couple of quick notes.\n\n 6                    Okay.   Ms. Greer, or Mr. Gibbs, whoever.\n\n 7              PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR DIRECTED VERDICT\n\n 8                    MR. GIBBS:    Yes, Your Honor.     At this\n\n 9   time, Your Honor, the Plaintiff, Zachry Construction\n\n10   Corporation reurges its motion for directed verdict at\n\n11   the close of the Defendant's case and the close of all\n\n12   the evidence.\n\n13                    We filed with you our motion on Monday,\n\n14   January the 11th.    I think we gave you a copy on\n\n15   January the 11th.    And it was filed January the 13th.\n\n16                    And we reurge that motion for instructed\n\n17   verdict, and we also urge the argument Zachry made at\n\n18   the hearing on January the 13th, 2009 (sic) on the\n\n19   record, yesterday, as part of our motion for directed\n\n20   verdict.\n\n21                    THE COURT:    All right.   I'd like to go\n\n22   through the table of contents of that motion, if you\n\n23   have a copy.\n\n24                    MR. GIBBS:    We do, Your Honor.\n\n25                    THE COURT:    And also ask that -- if\n\f                                                              9\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   Ms. Greer wants to -- only because we all worked on the\n\n 2   jury charge together -- and the things that I'm\n\n 3   prepared to grant with respect to your directed verdict\n\n 4   are essentially what's in the jury charge.\n\n 5                 And so -- at this point, so if we could\n\n 6   go through that, point by point.       And you maybe could\n\n 7   bring to the Court's attention the ones that you think\n\n 8   that are granted by virtue of the current language of\n\n 9   the jury charge.\n\n10                 MS. GREER:     Do you want me to -- well, I\n\n11   know a couple of things off the top of my head, then\n\n12   maybe can I take half a minute to look through it?\n\n13                 THE COURT:     Please.\n\n14                 MS. GREER:     Okay.     Your Honor, we\n\n15   believe that you have ruled -- or we would ask you to\n\n16   rule on directed verdict that Zachry is entitled as a\n\n17   matter of law to recover the damages sustained by New\n\n18   Zachry on the pass-through claim.\n\n19                 We believe that's what you've instructed\n\n20   the jury, and we would ask you to grant our directed\n\n21   verdict on that issue.\n\n22                 THE COURT:     Okay.\n\n23                 MS.

Okay.   And I\n\n 3   have ruled on that, and I will grant that aspect of\n\n 4   your motion.\n\n 5                  MS. GREER:   And then, Your Honor, we've\n\n 6   also moved for directed verdict on Zachry's failure to\n\n 7   comply a claim for the Port's failure to pay $2.36\n\n 8   million in the liquidated damages.\n\n 9                  We believe that you have instructed the\n\n10   jury in --\n\n11                  THE REPORTER:   Are the mikes on?\n\n12                  MR.

GREER:   Yes.\n\n23                  And we would ask you to grant a directed\n\n24   verdict to Zachry on that basis.\n\n25                  THE COURT:   All right.   Go ahead, yes.\n\f                                                           11\n                      Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1                  MS.

What I've put in\n\n 5   the jury charge and what I'm prepared to grant is that\n\n 6   I have determined that the Port has failed to comply\n\n 7   with the contract by failing to pay Zachry $2.36\n\n 8   million that the Port withheld as liquidated damages.\n\n 9                  Insofar as you have asked for that in a\n\n10   directed verdict, I'm granting that aspect of your\n\n11   motion.\n\n12                  MS. GREER:    Okay.   Thank you,\n\n13   Your Honor.\n\n14                  I believe that's all, Your Honor.\n\n15                  THE COURT:    All right.   I was -- so if\n\n16   you would look at the table of contents with me for a\n\n17   moment.   I was looking at -- in the table of contents\n\n18   Roman numeral -- Page Number Roman Numeral II, where\n\n19   you have Roman Numeral V -- 5, where it says, Zachry is\n\n20   entitled to a directed verdict on its right to recover\n\n21   damages sustained by New Zachry.\n\n22                  Is that covered by what I've previously\n\n23   set?\n\n24                  MS. GREER:    Yes, Your Honor, that is the\n\n25   portion of the directed verdict motion starts on Page\n\f                                                          12\n                     Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   69, that is the portion, that part, Part 5, Roman V is\n\n 2   the part that we believe that you have granted a\n\n 3   directed verdict motion on in the jury charge, and we\n\n 4   ask that you confirm that you granted directed verdict\n\n 5   on the arguments made therein.\n\n 6                 THE COURT:   All right.   It goes on to\n\n 7   say in subparts A -- in Subpart A of that -- in the\n\n 8   table of contents or in the motion, The direct verdict\n\n 9   is proper because the Port has met the burden to prove\n\n10   that Zachry is not liable to New Zachry and has -- and\n\n11   has not met that burden -- excuse me, because the Port\n\n12   has the burden of proof that Zachry is not liable to\n\n13   New Zachry and has not met that burden.\n\n14                 I guess my ruling is as a matter of law\n\n15   that I find that the -- there's a valid pass-through\n\n16   claim and any objections or legal arguments to the\n\n17   contrary by the Port are overruled.\n\n18                 MS. GREER:   Okay.   Thank you,\n\n19   Your Honor.\n\n20                 THE COURT:   Does that satisfy what\n\n21   you're asking for?\n\n22                 MS. GREER:   Well, we're asking you to\n\n23   rule as a matter of law that New Zachry,\n\n24   notwithstanding the Port's arguments to the contrary,\n\n25   has the right to -- that Zachry, notwithstanding the\n\f                                                             13\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   Port's arguments to the contrary, has the right to\n\n 2   recover New Zachry's damages as a matter of law in this\n\n 3   lawsuit.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Right.   I think that's what\n\n 5   I've granted.   I will grant that part of your motion.\n\n 6                   MS. GREER:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 7                   THE COURT:    And I know the Port is\n\n 8   opposed to that.\n\n 9                   MS. YEATES:    (Moving head up and down)\n\n10                   THE COURT:    And I've granted with\n\n11   respect -- I indicated with respect to Roman Numeral VI\n\n12   on Page Roman Numeral III with respect to the $2.36\n\n13   million, and you've moved with respect to the clearing\n\n14   and grubbing, and I'm not speaking for the Port, but\n\n15   it's my understanding that the Port has essentially\n\n16   abandoned that claim in that there was not evidence\n\n17   that the 25,000 or so for clearing and grubbing has\n\n18   been paid?\n\n19                   MS. YEATES:    That's correct, Your Honor.\n\n20                   THE COURT:    All right.   So I'm granting\n\n21   that part of Zachry's motion.\n\n22                   The Port, in our charge conference, we\n\n23   talked about the defense of both release and waiver,\n\n24   and it's my understanding that the Port's contention\n\n25   has been that the waiver argument, not the affirmative\n\f                                                             14\n                        Plaintiff's Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n\n 1   defensive waiver but with respect to I guess the\n\n 2   liquidated damages claim?\n\n 3                 MS. YEATES:     Right, Your Honor.    With\n\n 4   respect to the liquidated damages, we took away or out\n\n 5   of the charge, Your Honor took it out, and we're only\n\n 6   arguing release.\n\n 7                 THE COURT:     All right.    So I guess I\n\n 8   will grant a directed verdict then with respect to the\n\n 9   waiver aspect of the release argument?\n\n10                 MS. GREER:     If they're going to abandon\n\n11   it, I think that's sufficient.    But --\n\n12                 THE COURT:     Are you -- do you want to\n\n13   abandon it on the record or what?\n\n14                 MS. YEATES:     No, Your Honor.    The point\n\n15   was that we wanted the charge to be submitted as\n\n16   release as opposed to release and waiver.       And that's\n\n17   what Your Honor has done with respect to the liquidated\n\n18   damages.\n\n19                 MS. GREER:     My understanding was that\n\n20   they aren't seeking submission of waiver because it\n\n21   brought (inaudible) -- well, I'm not going to\n\n22   characterize why they're doing it, but that they are\n\n23   not asking you to submit it is my understanding.\n\n24                 MS. YEATES:     Your Honor, I won't be\n\n25   objecting or requesting waiver instruction with respect\n\n26   to liquidated damages.\n\f                                                             15\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                          COURT'S RULING\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    All right.   Then I will make\n\n 3   no ruling.\n\n 4                    And I believe, unless you would bring my\n\n 5   attention to anything else that we've spoken about with\n\n 6   respect to the jury charge, the rest of the motion for\n\n 7   directed verdict will be denied.\n\n 8                    MS. GREER:    It is all I can think of\n\n 9   right now, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Keep your voice up, please.\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    That's all I can think of\n\n12   right now, Your Honor.\n\n13                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, I think we're\n\n14   ready to do the charge objections.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let's hear the charge\n\n16   objections.\n\n17                    (At the bench, on the record)\n\n18        DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT'S CHARGE\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Defendant\n\n20   makes its objections to the Court's charge in the\n\n21   presence of the Court and opposing counsel and the\n\n22   court reporter and before the charge has been read to\n\n23   the jury.\n\n24                    After we finish making our objections,\n\n25   Your Honor, we get a ruling, then we'll be tendering\n\f        TAB 41\n\nObjections to the Charge\n       (71:15-73)\n\f                                                             15\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                          COURT'S RULING\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    All right.   Then I will make\n\n 3   no ruling.\n\n 4                    And I believe, unless you would bring my\n\n 5   attention to anything else that we've spoken about with\n\n 6   respect to the jury charge, the rest of the motion for\n\n 7   directed verdict will be denied.\n\n 8                    MS. GREER:    It is all I can think of\n\n 9   right now, Your Honor.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    Keep your voice up, please.\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    That's all I can think of\n\n12   right now, Your Honor.\n\n13                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, I think we're\n\n14   ready to do the charge objections.\n\n15                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let's hear the charge\n\n16   objections.\n\n17                    (At the bench, on the record)\n\n18        DEFENDANT'S OBJECTIONS TO THE COURT'S CHARGE\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Defendant\n\n20   makes its objections to the Court's charge in the\n\n21   presence of the Court and opposing counsel and the\n\n22   court reporter and before the charge has been read to\n\n23   the jury.\n\n24                    After we finish making our objections,\n\n25   Your Honor, we get a ruling, then we'll be tendering\n\f                                                            16\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   requested instructions to the Court for the Court's\n\n 2   consideration.\n\n 3                    THE COURT:    Yes, ma'am.\n\n 4                    MS. YEATES:    Our first objection is to\n\n 5   the agency instructions and the preliminary\n\n 6   instructions in the charge, Your Honor.         Because those\n\n 7   instructions we believe erroneously include the\n\n 8   apparent authority theory.\n\n 9                    As Your Honor knows, we believe there's\n\n10   no pleading to support the apparent authority theory\n\n11   and there's been no trial by consent and there's no\n\n12   trial amendment.    So we believe that theory should not\n\n13   be in the charge and we object to including it in the\n\n14   charge.\n\n15                    Your Honor, I'll ask you to rule on all\n\n16   of them at the end, Your Honor.\n\n17                    THE COURT:    Oh, all right.\n\n18                    MS. YEATES:    We believe the apparent\n\n19   authority in the charge is erroneous as a matter of\n\n20   law, Your Honor, because with respect to CH2M Hill's\n\n21   actual authority, Zachry was undisputedly on notice of\n\n22   the limitations of that actual authority.\n\n23                    And under Douglass versus Panama, that\n\n24   means the apparent authority theory cannot apply in\n\n25   this case.\n\f                                                           17\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  We also object to instructing the jury\n\n 2   on apparent authority because the Port is a public\n\n 3   entity that can only contract --\n\n 4                  THE COURT:    Slow down a little bit.\n\n 5                  MS. YEATES:    Can only contract in\n\n 6   writing and therefore apparent authority cannot apply\n\n 7   as a matter of law.   I believe you've heard all these.\n\n 8                  Furthermore, Your Honor, inclusion of\n\n 9   the apparent authority theory will improperly allow the\n\n10   jury to believe that CH2M Hill --\n\n11                  THE COURT:    Ms. Yeates, you got to slow\n\n12   down just a little.\n\n13                  MS. YEATES:    Okay.   Well, I'm sorry,\n\n14   Your Honor, my team is anxious.\n\n15                  Inclusion of the apparent authority\n\n16   theory in the charge will improperly allow the jury to\n\n17   believe that CH2M Hill could have apparent authority\n\n18   based on some conduct by the Port that held CH2M Hill\n\n19   out as the Port's agent.\n\n20                  In order, you see, Your Honor, to allow\n\n21   -- so that Zachry can argue that they could recover\n\n22   additional work directed by the Port, which is the\n\n23   Texas 271 -- Section 271 of the government code\n\n24   standard.\n\n25                  THE COURT:    Local government code,\n\f                                                           18\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   right?\n\n 2                   MS. YEATES:    Right, Your Honor.   And I'm\n\n 3   bringing that to the Court's attention because that\n\n 4   demonstrates the harmful error in including apparent\n\n 5   authority instruction in the charge.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:    Yes.\n\n 7                   MS. YEATES:    We also object, Your Honor,\n\n 8   to the instruction concerning the imputation of\n\n 9   knowledge, which is included in the Court's agency\n\n10   instructions.\n\n11                   That's the instruction that starts, A\n\n12   party's knowledge includes facts known to the party,\n\n13   etcetera.   The PJC authorizes no such instructions.     As\n\n14   Your Honor knows, we found no Texas case that\n\n15   authorizes such an instruction, and so we object to\n\n16   including it in the charge.\n\n17                   Your Honor, we also object to the\n\n18   absence from the charge of an instruction that an agent\n\n19   can be an agent for a party for one purpose but not\n\n20   other purposes.\n\n21                   That instruction is supported by the law\n\n22   and the evidence.   We don't believe it's submitted by\n\n23   implication from other instructions.     And the addition\n\n24   of that instruction is necessary in order for the\n\n25   Court's instructions on agency to be substantially\n\f                                                             19\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   correct.\n\n 2                    Because in this case, a central fact\n\n 3   issue presented is whether CH2M Hill was the Port's\n\n 4   agent for certain purposes but not the Port's agent for\n\n 5   other purposes.    In order properly to answer the\n\n 6   question, we believe the jury needs this instruction.\n\n 7                    At the conclusion of our objections, the\n\n 8   Port will tender Defendant's Requested Instruction No.\n\n 9   1, which would state that that other party may be\n\n10   authorized to act on behalf of a party for some\n\n11   purposes, while not being authorized to act on behalf\n\n12   of that party for other purposes.\n\n13                    And the Port objects to the omission\n\n14   from the Court's charge of that instruction.\n\n15                    The Port also objects to the omission\n\n16   from the charge, Your Honor, of an instruction charging\n\n17   the jury that in this case, authority for another to\n\n18   act for the Port can arise only from a written\n\n19   agreement made by the Port that allows the other party\n\n20   to act on behalf of and for the benefit of the Port.\n\n21                    And again, our argument there,\n\n22   Your Honor, is that the Port can only contract in\n\n23   writing, and therefore it could only can have an agent\n\n24   by writing.\n\n25                    The Port will be tendering Defendant's\n\f                                                          20\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Requested Instruction No. 2, which will state in this\n\n 2   case, authority for another to act for the Port can\n\n 3   arise only from a written agreement made by the Port\n\n 4   that allows the other party to act on behalf and for\n\n 5   the benefit of the Port.\n\n 6                 Furthermore, the Port objects to the\n\n 7   inclusion in the charge of apparent authority because\n\n 8   as a matter of law that theory cannot apply to the Port\n\n 9   given the Port's status as a governmental entity with\n\n10   governmental immunity, and so we object on that basis\n\n11   too, Your Honor.\n\n12                 Moving to the definition of New Zachry,\n\n13   Your Honor, that's in there because of Your Honor's\n\n14   pass-through ruling.\n\n15                 And obviously, we object to the ruling,\n\n16   Your Honor, and to -- well, I'll be objecting to those\n\n17   parts of the charge that go to the ruling because we\n\n18   believe that New Zachry is not the Plaintiff in the\n\n19   case and that Zachry does not have a valid pass-through\n\n20   claim for all the reasons that we argued in our motion\n\n21   to strike, which Your Honor overruled.\n\n22                 And principally, Your Honor, you'll\n\n23   remember that's because New Zachry was created and\n\n24   retained by Zachry to be the subcontractor only after\n\n25   the breach occurred and therefore the Port's breach\n\f                                                            21\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   could not have caused the damages to New Zachry in this\n\n 2   context.\n\n 3                   So we object to the New Zachry\n\n 4   definition, and we'll be objecting to the other\n\n 5   instructions on that basis.\n\n 6                   Your Honor, in your instructions, you\n\n 7   instruct multiple times concerning ambiguity and trade\n\n 8   custom.    We've talked about that.\n\n 9                   It's our belief that those instructions,\n\n10   because they appear multiple times in the charge,\n\n11   should be in the preliminary instructions one time in\n\n12   the front of the charge.\n\n13                   I'm particularly concerned about this\n\n14   with respect to trade/usage because it's our position\n\n15   that there is no evidence to raise a fact issue on the\n\n16   legal standard from when a trade custom or usage\n\n17   arises.\n\n18                   And that by instructing the jury\n\n19   multiple times on that, the Judge -- the Court\n\n20   improperly comments on the weight of the evidence by\n\n21   nudging or telling the jury that the Court thinks,\n\n22   Well, there must be a trade custom or usage because I'm\n\n23   asking about it several times in the charge.\n\n24                   And we believe that because the trade\n\n25   custom or usage relates to the ambiguity instruction,\n\f                                                             22\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   the proper thing to do would be to take the ambiguity\n\n 2   instruction and trade custom and usage and put them\n\n 3   both in the front of the charge.\n\n 4                    THE COURT:    Slow down.   If you want this\n\n 5   on the record, you've got to slow down.\n\n 6                    MS. YEATES:    Okay.\n\n 7                    And if you put it in the front of the\n\n 8   charge, Your Honor, you would lead the instruction by\n\n 9   saying, In answering questions that require you to\n\n10   decide the meaning of an agreement, you must decide the\n\n11   meaning by determining the intent of the parties at the\n\n12   time of the agreement, and then continue with the\n\n13   Court's instructions on ambiguity.\n\n14                    Your Honor, the Port further objects to\n\n15   the inclusion instruction in the charge on trade custom\n\n16   and usage because, as I've stated, Your Honor, there's\n\n17   no evidence to raise an issue on that.\n\n18                    Your Honor, I've talked about the\n\n19   ordering of the questions in the charge and we object\n\n20   to the fact that the charge does not have the excuse\n\n21   questions in each cluster following liability.\n\n22                    We think that's the appropriate, proper\n\n23   way to do it and we object to not doing it that way,\n\n24   Your Honor.\n\n25                    On Question No. 1, I think our only\n\f                                                           23\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   objection there at this point is that the Port is\n\n 2   charging the jury as to what the jury may consider in\n\n 3   deciding Question No. 1, and that's the ambiguity\n\n 4   instruction.   And again, we think that should be in the\n\n 5   front of the charge.\n\n 6                  Your Honor, moving to Question No. 2 --\n\n 7   oh, I'm sorry, also on Question No. 1, the Court\n\n 8   instructs the jury not to consider Section 5.10 with\n\n 9   respect to breach of 5.10.     And the Port objects to the\n\n10   Court giving that instruction.\n\n11                  THE COURT:    I thought we -- didn't we\n\n12   change that?\n\n13                  MS. YEATES:    No.   It's limited to\n\n14   breach, Your Honor.    But remember my position was it\n\n15   shouldn't be in there at all.\n\n16                  That's Ms. Greer's concern that there\n\n17   could be an irreconcilable conflict between the two\n\n18   findings.\n\n19                  THE COURT:    How -- did we change the\n\n20   wording of that though?     What question is it?\n\n21                  MS. YEATES:    It's Question 1.\n\n22                  MS. GREER:    1.\n\n23                  I think what you had in the draft last\n\n24   night was, In answering this question only, you're not\n\n25   being asked to decide whether the Port failed to comply\n\f                                                          24\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   with Section 5.10 of the contract.\n\n 2                   MS. YEATES:    And, you know,\n\n 3   Your Honor --\n\n 4                   THE COURT:    Question 1?\n\n 5                   MS. YEATES:    Right.     Well, that's\n\n 6   just --\n\n 7                   THE COURT:    Oh, yeah.     Yeah.\n\n 8                   MS. YEATES:    -- Ms. Greer's concern\n\n 9   about irreconcilable findings, Your Honor.\n\n10                   But we believe the instruction will\n\n11   mislead and confuse the jury into believing that the\n\n12   jury cannot consider Section 5.10 in determining\n\n13   whether the Port failed to comply with Change Order 4.\n\n14                   And we believe that's error, Your Honor,\n\n15   erroneous because Change Order 4 incorporates the rest\n\n16   of the contract to the extent the rest of the contract\n\n17   is not in conflict with Change Order 4.\n\n18                   Therefore, at the conclusion of these\n\n19   objections -- well, we object to having the instruction\n\n20   in there at all.\n\n21                   But at the inclusion of the objections,\n\n22   we'll be requesting Defendant's Requested Question No.\n\n23   3, which states, However, you may consider Section 5.10\n\n24   in determining whether the Port failed to comply with\n\n25   Change Order 4.    You may consider it in deciding\n\f                                                             25\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Question 1.\n\n 2                    And we think if you're going to give\n\n 3   that instruction that's in the charge, Your Honor, that\n\n 4   this additional instruction would also be required.\n\n 5                    And again, this is something we\n\n 6   discussed last night.\n\n 7                    MS. GREER:    Our response would be a\n\n 8   comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n 9                    MS. YEATES:    Right.\n\n10                    THE COURT:    What?\n\n11                    MS. GREER:    Our response to that\n\n12   argument was that it would be a comment on the weight\n\n13   of the evidence designed to nudge the jury.\n\n14                    And in fact, it would tell the jury to\n\n15   adopt the position that Section 2.02, Precedence\n\n16   Provision, as a matter of law does not cause Change\n\n17   Order 4 to trump the general conditions and the\n\n18   technical specifications, 5.10, all those.\n\n19                    MS. YEATES:    And of course, our\n\n20   position, Your Honor, is if we're going to point the\n\n21   jury in the instruction you're giving and tell them not\n\n22   to consider whether 5.10 is breached, that that leads\n\n23   the jury to believe they're not supposed to look at\n\n24   5.10.\n\n25                    THE COURT:    I understand.\n\f                                                           26\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  MS. YEATES:   Okay.\n\n 2                  Your Honor, on the next instruction I\n\n 3   would like to go to under Question 1 is the instruction\n\n 4   that states, Furthermore, in answering this question\n\n 5   only, you are instructed that nothing in Section 5.41\n\n 6   gave the Port the right to issue its revise and\n\n 7   resubmit.\n\n 8                  We believe this instruction is erroneous\n\n 9   because it's based on an incorrect construction and\n\n10   interpretation of the contract.\n\n11                  It's not -- we don't believe it's a\n\n12   proper -- restatement of what the Court's ruling was\n\n13   intended to go to with respect to your ruling on the\n\n14   meaning of 5.41.\n\n15                  And we thought the Court's ruling was\n\n16   going to the point that Zachry was not required to\n\n17   obtain a written change directive or change order in\n\n18   order to recover.   And so we believe this instruction\n\n19   goes beyond what we thought the point of the Court's\n\n20   pretrial ruling was.\n\n21                  Furthermore, we believe it's erroneous\n\n22   as a matter of law as explained in all our previous\n\n23   objections to the Court's instructions concerning 5.41.\n\n24                  And the Court's instruction is based on\n\n25   the erroneous application, we believe, of the so-called\n\f                                                             27\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   radical change doctrine, and on the Shintech and\n\n 2   Columbia Gas line of cases.\n\n 3                    And we believe those are inapplicable\n\n 4   here because Section 3.09 of the contract, you'll\n\n 5   recall, provides that no action or failure to act by\n\n 6   the Port can constitute a waiver of a right of the Port\n\n 7   under the contract.\n\n 8                    Moreover, here, the Port didn't\n\n 9   relinquish its contractual procedural rights under\n\n10   Section 5.41 even in the event of a breach because the\n\n11   Port's procedural rights under 5.41 go directly to the\n\n12   breach issue, and that's the legal rationale of the\n\n13   Technip case that we've discussed.\n\n14                    I believe you've heard these arguments,\n\n15   Your Honor.\n\n16                    Also, under the Texas Water Code and\n\n17   other provisions of Texas law, the Port is statutorily\n\n18   prohibited from making any binding contract that's not\n\n19   in writing.    And that's exactly what Section 4.1 (sic)\n\n20   is going to when it says, If a contractor is going to\n\n21   do additional work, he has to get a written change\n\n22   order.\n\n23                    MS. GREER:    That's --\n\n24                    THE COURT:    4.1 or 5.41?\n\n25                    MS. YEATES:    I'm sorry, 5.41. I\n\f                                                           28\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   apologize, Your Honor.\n\n 2                  THE COURT:    I just wanted your record to\n\n 3   be clear.\n\n 4                  MS. YEATES:    Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 5                  Furthermore, the Court's instruction is\n\n 6   erroneous as a matter of law because the Port has\n\n 7   governmental immunity, which is waived only to the\n\n 8   extent permitted by Chapter 271 of the Texas Local\n\n 9   Government Code.\n\n10                  And we believe Section 5.41 goes\n\n11   directly to whether the amount sought by Zachry comes\n\n12   within that waiver of immunity.    The Shintech and\n\n13   Columbia Gas line of cases are not attempting to deal\n\n14   with the situation of governmental immunity.\n\n15                  Even if the radical change doctrine or\n\n16   the Shintech line of law applied, they would not make\n\n17   Section 5.41 relevant to whether the Port had the right\n\n18   to revise and resubmit.\n\n19                  We believe Section 5.41 does not go to\n\n20   that issue, and that is why we believe the instruction\n\n21   given in connection with Question No. 1 is erroneous as\n\n22   a matter of law.\n\n23                  And -- now, Your Honor, it also, the\n\n24   instruction on 5.41 also, we believe, constitutes an\n\n25   impermissible comment --\n\f                                                             29\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    THE COURT:    Slow down.\n\n 2                    MS. YEATES:    And impermissible comment\n\n 3   on the weight of the evidence serving to tilt or nudge\n\n 4   the jury to find in Zachry's favor.         And the\n\n 5   instruction, we believe, is not correct or helpful to\n\n 6   the jury.\n\n 7                    Your Honor, I would now like to, with\n\n 8   respect to Question 1, simply reurge our matter of law\n\n 9   arguments that we believe we've made to you previously\n\n10   on why the Port believes that it is correct as a matter\n\n11   of law that Change Order 1 didn't -- Change Order 4 did\n\n12   not entitle Zachry to use the frozen cutoff wall.\n\n13                    And we've argued all those things,\n\n14   Your Honor, in opposition to the Port's Rule 166(g)\n\n15   motion, and so I'm not going to repeat them here.      It's\n\n16   just a law argument.\n\n17                    Your Honor, on Question No. 2, we again,\n\n18   have the instruction on ambiguity and trade/usage.\n\n19   And again, we object to including it multiple times in\n\n20   the charge.\n\n21                    The Port objects to the instruction\n\n22   under Question No. 2 telling the jury that it may\n\n23   decide the meaning of Section 5.10 and 5.22 by\n\n24   considering trade usage or custom.\n\n25                    Your Honor, as you know, there's -- the\n\f                                                           30\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   PJC says it's not even clear, it's an appropriate\n\n 2   instruction in the charge.    And most importantly,\n\n 3   Zachry has not adduced evidence to meet the legal\n\n 4   standard to raise a fact issue on whether there's any\n\n 5   trade custom or usage.    So we would object on that\n\n 6   basis.\n\n 7                  We further object to this instruction\n\n 8   concerning 5.41 given in connection with Question 2.\n\n 9   We believe it's based on an incorrect construction and\n\n10   interpretation of the contract.    And therefore, is not\n\n11   a proper restatement of the Court's prior rulings with\n\n12   regard to Section 5.41.\n\n13                  We continue to assert all the\n\n14   objections, Your Honor, that we've made during trial to\n\n15   Your Honor's instructions with respect to Section 5.41.\n\n16                  Two hours of sleep last night.\n\n17                  MS. GREER:    Quit bragging.\n\n18                  (Laughing)\n\n19                  MS. YEATES:    And so I'm not going to\n\n20   repeat all of our arguments that I just made a minute\n\n21   ago about why the Shintech line doesn't support the\n\n22   ruling or why the radical change doctrine doesn't the\n\n23   ruling.   I won't repeat any of that.\n\n24                  And we believe again, that this\n\n25   instruction would be an impermissible and harmful\n\f                                                          31\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   comment on the weight, serving to tilt or nudge the\n\n 2   jury to find in favor of Zachry.\n\n 3                 And then I would like to go on now to\n\n 4   Question No. 3 on the statutory measure of damages, we\n\n 5   agree that Your Honor's instruction is correct, that\n\n 6   that is the statutory measure.\n\n 7                 Our objection here is we believe\n\n 8   Zachry's adduced no proof of amounts due and owing\n\n 9   under the contract.   That's our argument.\n\n10                 And therefore, I want to assert it here\n\n11   that we think it's error to ask Question No. 3 because\n\n12   we believe Zachry has no evidence to raise a fact issue\n\n13   that would allow the submission of the statutory\n\n14   measure of damages.\n\n15                 Your Honor, we also with respect to the\n\n16   statutory measure of damages, Subpart B in the\n\n17   instruction under Question No. 3, the Port objects\n\n18   because, among other reasons, outside of the written\n\n19   executed change order, the Port cannot direct work for\n\n20   Zachry -- cannot direct Zachry to do additional work.\n\n21                 And there is no evidence that Zachry was\n\n22   directed by the Port to do additional work.   And\n\n23   therefore, we object to the submission of the second\n\n24   prong of Section 271 because we think there's no\n\n25   evidence to raise the issue and there's no evidence of\n\f                                                          32\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   a written executed change order.\n\n 2                 Your Honor, now we come to the\n\n 3   pass-through instructions and I'm not going to repeat\n\n 4   all the arguments we made before, Your Honor, but\n\n 5   obviously, we believe the pass-through instruction,\n\n 6   which is the instruction under Question 3, telling the\n\n 7   jury that they should include reimbursable costs\n\n 8   incurred by New Zachry.\n\n 9                 We believe that instruction is improper\n\n10   because we don't think there is a valid -- legally\n\n11   valid, pass-through claim in this case for all the\n\n12   reasons we stated in our motion to strike the\n\n13   pass-through claim.\n\n14                 Your Honor, we also object to the way --\n\n15   telling the jury in the pass-through instruction that\n\n16   the jury should include reimbursable costs.\n\n17                 We believe that that's an impermissible\n\n18   comment on the weight, nudging the jury to find for\n\n19   Zachry and we think it should say the jury may include\n\n20   reimbursable costs.\n\n21                 To make the instruction correct, the\n\n22   Court would need to add the following sentence at the\n\n23   end of the instruction.\n\n24                 THE COURT:    This is question?\n\n25                 MS. YEATES:    This is Question 3, the\n\f                                                          33\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   pass-through instruction.\n\n 2                    THE COURT:    Okay.   Let me get there.\n\n 3                    MS. YEATES:    The instruction that we\n\n 4   think would have to be added is, You may include such\n\n 5   reimbursable costs only to the extent that Zachry\n\n 6   agreed, in the management service agreement, to pay New\n\n 7   Zachry such reimbursable costs.\n\n 8                    At the conclusion of the objections,\n\n 9   Your Honor, I'll request that instruction as\n\n10   Defendant's Requested Instruction No. 4.\n\n11                    And we believe omitting that instruction\n\n12   makes the pass-through instruction legally defective\n\n13   and erroneous as a matter of law because the\n\n14   fundamental premise of a pass-through claim is that the\n\n15   Plaintiff asserting the claim has to prove the\n\n16   liability of that Plaintiff contractor to the\n\n17   subcontractor.\n\n18                    And we believe that's what our requested\n\n19   instruction goes to.\n\n20                    Your Honor, you have instructions on\n\n21   Section 5.41, 5.42 and 5.52 and that's under Question 3\n\n22   and that's the instruction which begins, You are\n\n23   instructed that Zachry was not required to take certain\n\n24   actions.\n\n25                    We believe the instruction is incorrect\n\f                                                             34\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   as a matter of law.    I'm going to separately object to\n\n 2   this on 5.40 -- as to the extent it goes to 5.41, on\n\n 3   the one hand, 5.52, on the other hand and 5.42, on the\n\n 4   other hand.\n\n 5                    The Port continues to assert and does\n\n 6   not waive all the objections that we've previously\n\n 7   raised to the Court's instructions concerning -- given\n\n 8   to the jury already -- concerning 5.41.\n\n 9                    And for all the reasons I've already\n\n10   articulated, Your Honor, concerning how the radical\n\n11   change doctrine doesn't apply, Shintech line of cases\n\n12   doesn't apply, all those arguments I've already made as\n\n13   to why we believe Your Honor's ruling on Section 5.41\n\n14   is in error, we believe all those reasons make the\n\n15   instructions with respect to this instruction also in\n\n16   error.\n\n17                    And we believe the instructions and\n\n18   impermissible comment on the weight of the evidence,\n\n19   the effect would be to tilt or nudge the jury to find\n\n20   for Zachry.\n\n21                    The Court's instruction concerning 5.41\n\n22   not requiring a written change order is particularly\n\n23   harmful to the Port because the measure of damages in\n\n24   the charge allows the jury to recover for additional\n\n25   work that Zachry was directed to perform.\n\f                                                          35\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                 And under Section 5.41 the requirement\n\n 2   of a written change order before the contractor is\n\n 3   entitled to be paid for additional work is precisely\n\n 4   what Section 5.41 is designed to require.   And so that\n\n 5   is why we believe the instruction and the Court's\n\n 6   ruling with respect to 5.41 is harmful error in the\n\n 7   case.\n\n 8                 And we also believe Your Honor's already\n\n 9   charged the jury with respect to what they should\n\n10   consider on 5.41 and that they should not be charged in\n\n11   this instruction again.\n\n12                 Your Honor, with respect to your\n\n13   instruction on 5.52, here under Question 3, it applies\n\n14   5.52 to the extent 5.52 makes requirements consistent\n\n15   with Section 5.41.\n\n16                 And so, therefore, we would just say all\n\n17   of the same objections that we asserted against the\n\n18   instruction on 5.41 also apply with respect to 5.42\n\n19   (sic).\n\n20                 And now that takes me to the objections\n\n21   with respect to the instruction on Section 5.42.     And\n\n22   the Port objects to those instructions because again,\n\n23   Your Honor, we believe the Court's ruling on Section\n\n24   5.42 is erroneous as a matter of law.\n\n25                 We've already explained that we think\n\f                                                          36\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   the radical change doctrine doesn't apply to 5.42.     And\n\n 2   we believe that 5.42 is not invalid under Section\n\n 3   16.071 of the Remedies Code because it's not the kind\n\n 4   of notice provision that comes within that section\n\n 5   under the American Airlines case.   And nor does\n\n 6   Shintech or Columbia Gas line of cases make 5.42\n\n 7   inapplicable in this case.\n\n 8                  So we, for all the reasons we previously\n\n 9   have asserted in our objections to Your Honor's\n\n10   instructions given to the jury on Section 5.42, we\n\n11   object to this instruction on 5.42 included in the\n\n12   Court's charge under Question No. 3.\n\n13                  Your Honor, your -- the sentence that\n\n14   you have in the instruction that says, You are\n\n15   instructed that the jury may consider Sections 5.41,\n\n16   5.42 and 5.52 with respect to assessing a party's state\n\n17   of mind, we believe that that instruction repeats what\n\n18   Your Honor has said during trial.\n\n19                  To the extent the instruction has been\n\n20   expanded to include 5.52, we would just assert against\n\n21   that instruction, Your Honor, all of the objections\n\n22   that we previously have made to Your Honor's\n\n23   instruction given during trial with respect to the\n\n24   instruction.\n\n25                  However -- I think I know where Jenny is\n\f                                                          37\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   going -- we believe the instruction needs to be in the\n\n 2   charge because of the Court's previous instruction\n\n 3   given on these provisions under Question 3.\n\n 4                  And having decided to instruct the jury\n\n 5   under Question 3 with respect to what 5.41, 5.42 and\n\n 6   5.52 do not require Zachry to do to recover damages.\n\n 7   We do believe it's necessary at this point for\n\n 8   Your Honor to repeat the instruction.\n\n 9                  My problem is, the instruction that Your\n\n10   Honor has given earlier, we objected to because we\n\n11   think it's based on an erroneous ruling -- reading and\n\n12   interpretation and error of law as to those sections --\n\n13                  MS. GREER:    You're saying you only\n\n14   requested that instruction about state of mind because\n\n15   the Judge is putting in the first instruction --\n\n16                  MS. YEATES:    Right.   Right.   It's\n\n17   necessary in the charge because of the first\n\n18   instruction.\n\n19                  MS. GREER:    Okay.\n\n20                  MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, on the NDFD\n\n21   exceptions, no damages for delay exceptions,\n\n22   Your Honor, we object to submitting to the jury the\n\n23   instructions concerning those exceptions to the no\n\n24   damages for delay or hindrance provision.\n\n25                  Specifically, those are the instructions\n\f                                                           38\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   concerning arbitrary and capricious conduct, bad faith,\n\n 2   etcetera.   Your Honor, Texas doesn't recognize these\n\n 3   common law exceptions, and we believe that even if\n\n 4   Texas did recognize those exceptions, the language of\n\n 5   this particular Section 5.07, no damages for delay\n\n 6   clause would preclude application of those exceptions.\n\n 7                  And there is no evidence and no legally\n\n 8   insufficient evidence of damages resulting from a delay\n\n 9   or hindrance that could of possibly have been caused by\n\n10   any conduct, egregious conduct of the Port constituting\n\n11   arbitrary and capricious conduct, bad faith, active\n\n12   interference or fraud as defined in the Court's charge\n\n13   under Question No. 3.\n\n14                  Also, Your Honor, and I mentioned this\n\n15   to you in the informal charge conference, Your Honor,\n\n16   we object to the instruction concerning the no damages\n\n17   for delay provision, Section 5.07 because that\n\n18   instruction omits the requirement that the Port -- any\n\n19   egregious conduct of the Port, arbitrary and\n\n20   capricious, bad faith, active interference or fraud,\n\n21   that that conduct must be the sole cause of any delay\n\n22   or hindrance damages.\n\n23                  A major fact issue in this case is who\n\n24   caused Zachry to be delayed so behind schedule?   If --\n\n25   we believe, under the law, Your Honor, if the delay was\n\f                                                            39\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   also caused by Zachry, then that delay, even if\n\n 2   contributed to by the Port's alleged egregious conduct,\n\n 3   cannot constitute an exception to the no damages for\n\n 4   delay or hindrance provision.\n\n 5                   We believe the Court's instructions are\n\n 6   defective because they incorrectly omit the sole cause\n\n 7   requirement.\n\n 8                   To correct that omission, the language\n\n 9   in the Court's instruction under Question 3 should be\n\n10   modified so that the language refers to a delay or\n\n11   hindrance that was solely the result of the Port's\n\n12   actions, if any, that constituted arbitrary and\n\n13   capricious conduct, etcetera.\n\n14                   And we object to the omission of the\n\n15   word solely in the Court's instruction under Question\n\n16   No. 3.\n\n17                   Your Honor, with respect to the active\n\n18   interference definition in Question No. 3, the Port\n\n19   objects to that instruction defining active\n\n20   interference because the instruction omits the words\n\n21   taken to before the words unreasonably interfere.\n\n22                   We believe the instruction should\n\n23   properly be worded, Active interference means\n\n24   affirmative, willful action taken to unreasonably\n\n25   interfere.\n\f                                                           40\n                 Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                  We believe those words are necessary\n\n 2   because to constitute active interference, a party has\n\n 3   to intend to interfere.\n\n 4                  MS. GREER:    Wait a second.   I thought\n\n 5   you agreed that it would be to interfere if you got the\n\n 6   second sentence of that instruction.     That it would be\n\n 7   that unreasonably interferes -- let me get back to my\n\n 8   question.\n\n 9                  I thought the agreement was that you\n\n10   would not object to active interference means\n\n11   affirmative, willful action that unreasonably\n\n12   interferes with the other party's compliance with the\n\n13   contract.   You would agree to that, if the Judge\n\n14   submitted active interference requires more than a\n\n15   simple mistake, error in judgment, lack of total\n\n16   effort, or lack of complete diligence.\n\n17                  MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the first\n\n18   sentence, as stated, allows an act that we didn't\n\n19   intend to be interference to constitute interference\n\n20   without scienter intention, and so I have to object to\n\n21   that.   I can't let that -- no, I object to that.\n\n22                  Your Honor, the fraud definition\n\n23   includes recklessness in Question No. 3.      Your Honor,\n\n24   we talked about this in our informal charge conference.\n\n25                  Our position is that under Texas law\n\f                                                          41\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   from the Texas Supreme Court, fraud, as a promise with\n\n 2   no intent to perform, can only be intentional fraud;\n\n 3   and therefore, we believe it's error to include the\n\n 4   reckless fraud instruction in that question.\n\n 5                 Now, we turn to Question No. 4, and,\n\n 6   Your Honor, we asked for this question, we believe it\n\n 7   should be in the charge under Casteel.    I'm just\n\n 8   pointing out that the only reason we asked for it is\n\n 9   because Your Honor is allowing Zachry to submit the\n\n10   pass-through damages.\n\n11                 And I don't want my failure to object to\n\n12   that question to somehow waive my argument that we\n\n13   believe there's no valid pass-through claim in that\n\n14   case.\n\n15                 Similarly, Your Honor, with respect to\n\n16   the break out question, I believe I just talked about\n\n17   the pass-through, that's actually break out question --\n\n18   it's Question No. 5.    But I have a similar point to\n\n19   make on Question No. 4, the break out question for\n\n20   delay or hindrance.\n\n21                 We asked for that question but I don't\n\n22   want -- we need it because Your Honor has included\n\n23   delay or hindrance in the damages, but obviously, we\n\n24   don't waive our position that delay or hindrance\n\n25   damages are just not recoverable as a matter of law by\n\f                                                          42\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   asking Your Honor to give the break out instruction\n\n 2   that -- that breaks out under Casteel the dollars that\n\n 3   represent the delay or hindrance damages.\n\n 4                 Your Honor, I now want to turn to\n\n 5   Question No. 6, Subsection D, the release instruction,\n\n 6   which again includes the ambiguity and trade custom or\n\n 7   usage.\n\n 8                 Again, we object to repeating these\n\n 9   instructions over and over again in the charge.       And\n\n10   particularly with respect to the releases, Your Honor,\n\n11   that we do not believe there's any evidence to raise\n\n12   the legal standard for what constitutes a trade custom\n\n13   or industry usage.     And we believe it's an improper\n\n14   comment on the weight of the evidence.\n\n15                 With respect to Question No. 8, which is\n\n16   Zachry's counter-defenses, Your Honor, we talked about\n\n17   this last night.     We believe that the waiver\n\n18   instruction, because this is waiver of fraud, should\n\n19   require an additional instruction that would say, With\n\n20   respect to fraud, waiver requires full knowledge of the\n\n21   fraud, and all material facts, and must be made with\n\n22   the intention, clearly manifested, of abiding by the\n\n23   contract and waiving all right to assert deception.\n\n24                 And so we'll be requesting that,\n\n25   Your Honor, as Requested Instruction No. 5.       Because we\n\f                                                          43\n                Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   believe that's necessary to make the definition correct\n\n 2   with respect to waiver of fraud.\n\n 3                 On quasi-estoppel the Port objects to\n\n 4   Question No. 8 to the extent that it inquires whether\n\n 5   the Port is barred from asserting fraud in the\n\n 6   inducement because of quasi-estoppel.\n\n 7                 We believe as a matter of law, the\n\n 8   doctrine of quasi-estoppel does not apply to bar the\n\n 9   defense of fraudulent inducement.   It cannot be, as a\n\n10   matter of law, that it's unconscionable for a party to\n\n11   assert that it was defrauded.\n\n12                 The Port further objects to the\n\n13   instruction on quasi-estoppel given in connection with\n\n14   Question 8 because it fails to tell the jury that the\n\n15   party to be estopped must have taken its previous\n\n16   position with full knowledge of the fraud and all\n\n17   material facts.\n\n18                 We'll be tendering Defendant's Requested\n\n19   Instruction No. 6, which would state that with respect\n\n20   to the fraud, the prior position previously taken by\n\n21   the party to be estopped must have been taken with full\n\n22   knowledge of the fraud and all material facts and must\n\n23   have been taken with the intention, clearly manifested,\n\n24   of abiding by the contract and not asserting the other\n\n25   party's deception.\n\f                                                             44\n                   Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    And we object to the omission of this\n\n 2   sentence from the instruction on quasi-estoppel.\n\n 3                    Finally, Your Honor, with respect to\n\n 4   ratification in the charge, the instruction concerning\n\n 5   ratification in Question 8 states -- refers to the\n\n </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">Port.</span>\n\n <span class=\"page\">7</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">                    With respect to the counter-defense, the\n\n 8   Port is not making an affirmative claim for fraud.       And\n\n 9   so at the end of that instruction on ratification it\n\n10   currently says, All right to recover for the deception,\n\n11   and what we were doing is asserting a defense.\n\n12                    And so we think it should say, All right\n\n13   to assert the deception, and not all right to recover\n\n14   for the deception since we're not seeking to recover\n\n15   for the deception.\n\n16                    MS. GREER:    Your Honor, we would need to\n\n17   change that because Ms. Yeates dictated that\n\n18   instruction to you yesterday for what would be an\n\n19   appropriate instruction for ratification, so we would\n\n20   agree that that should go in there then --\n\n21                    MS. YEATES:    And I apologize for this,\n\n22   Your Honor, we caught this in the middle of the night\n\n23   last night.    And I think --\n\n24                    THE COURT:    So which question?\n\n25                    MS. GREER:    Question No. 8.\n\f                                                            45\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                   MS. YEATES:    Question 8, ratification,\n\n 2   Subsection C.   We believe it should say, All right to\n\n 3   assert the deception, not all right to recover for the\n\n 4   deception.\n\n 5                   And I'm nearly finished, Your Honor.\n\n 6                   THE COURT:    Wait.   Waiving all right to\n\n 7   assert?\n\n 8                   MS. YEATES:    Assert the deception.\n\n 9                   THE COURT:    Assert the thought?\n\n10                   MS. YEATES:    Assert the deception.\n\n11                   THE COURT:    Okay.\n\n12                   MS. YEATES:    Your Honor, the Port\n\n13   further objects to the instruction concerning\n\n14   quasi-estoppel because we believe it's wrong and that\n\n15   if fails to tell the jury -- I did that?      Okay.\n\n16                   And then on Question No. 9 -- oh, we did\n\n17   that already.\n\n18                   Your Honor, on Question No. 11 in the\n\n19   Court's charge, the excuse question, we've objected to\n\n20   instructing multiple times in the charge on ambiguity\n\n21   and trade custom, so we object again here to that.\n\n22                   And the Port -- now, I want to turn to\n\n23   Question No. 12.   The question that tells the jury --\n\n24   oh, this is the instruction in the Court's charge and\n\n25   Your Honor's directed verdict that the Court has\n\f                                                            46\n                  Defendant's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   determined that the Port failed to comply with the\n\n 2   contract by failing to pay.\n\n 3                   And I just want to make the point there,\n\n 4   Your Honor, that obviously, we disagree with the\n\n 5   Court's ruling that you made on Sections 5.05 and 5.06.\n\n 6   And so we have to object to that instruction, and we do\n\n 7   object.\n\n 8                   MS. GREER:    My understanding is you\n\n 9   don't object to the fact that he is giving the\n\n10   instruction, only to the fact --\n\n11                   MS. YEATES:    I object to the ruling\n\n12   giving rise to the instruction --\n\n13                   MS. GREER:    Exactly.\n\n14                   MS. YEATES:    -- and the instruction\n\n15   wouldn't be in the charge but for the ruling.        And but\n\n16   for that ruling, Your Honor, we would be submitting --\n\n17   Your Honor would be submitting in the charge failure to\n\n18   comply questions and damages questions.\n\n19                   MS. GREER:    But given his ruling, it's\n\n20   an appropriate way to open the -- the excuse question.\n\n21                   MS. YEATES:    Okay.     Your Honor, the Port\n\n22   objects --\n\n23                   MS. GREER:    Is that correct?\n\n24                   MS.

You\n\n14   okay?\n\n15                   THE REPORTER:     No, I'm fine.\n\n16                   THE COURT:    Okay.

That's General Conditions Section\n\n22   2.02(a).\n\n23                 The general conditions therefore could\n\n24   not give the Port the right to issue the October 11,\n\n25   2005 response with respect to a design that it had\n\f                                                          51\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   already agreed to in Change Order 4.\n\n 2                 The Port (sic) should therefore instruct\n\n 3   the jury, If you find that Change Order 4 included in\n\n 4   agreement that Zachry could use the frozen cutoff wall\n\n 5   design embodied in the September 9, 2005 design, then\n\n 6   in answering this question only, you are instructed\n\n 7   that nothing in the general conditions or the technical\n\n 8   specifications of the contract including but not\n\n 9   limited to General Conditions Section 5.22, 5.41, 5.42\n\n10   and 5.52, gave the Port the right to issue its October\n\n11   11, 2005 response to the September 9, 2005 frozen\n\n12   cutoff wall design.\n\n13                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n14   Proposed Issue No. 3 on this issue.\n\n15                 Alternatively, Zachry would be entitled,\n\n16   consistent with this Court's prior rulings concerning\n\n17   the exclusion of Section 5.42 and 5.52 as well as their\n\n18   inapplicability on their face as a matter of law, to\n\n19   create a right in the Port to issue the October 11,\n\n20   2009 (sic) response.\n\n21                 Zachry would be entitled to an\n\n22   instruction that adds Section 5.42 and 5.52 to the\n\n23   instruction that the Court is already giving the jury,\n\n24   such that the instruction would now say, In answering\n\n25   this question, you are instructed that nothing in\n\f                                                             52\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Section 5.41, 5.42 or 5.52 gave the Port the right to\n\n 2   issue its October 11, 2005 response to the September 9,\n\n 3   2005 frozen cutoff wall design.\n\n 4                    Zachry objects to the absence of this\n\n 5   instruction, and will tender a proposed instruction\n\n 6   separately.    It will be Proposed Issue No. 4.\n\n 7                    Although Zachry has proposed that the\n\n 8   prior instructions be included in the Court's Question\n\n 9   No. 1, because that is how the Court has stated it will\n\n10   submit Change Order 4 issues.\n\n11                    Zachry believes the issues of the proper\n\n12   interpretation of Change Order 4 and the failure to\n\n13   comply with Change Order 4 should be submitted\n\n14   separately, rather than in one question as submitted by\n\n15   the Court, for the reasons discussed below.\n\n16                    Doing so would simplify the issues and\n\n17   make clear to the jury that there are two separate\n\n18   questions, interpretation and breach, that the jury\n\n19   should answer.\n\n20                    Zachry will separately tender a proposed\n\n21   instruction on these questions.    They will be Proposed\n\n22   Instructions Nos. 5 and 6.\n\n23                    Furthermore, combining the\n\n24   interpretation and failure to comply issues into one\n\n25   question obscures the basis for the jury's answers.\n\f                                                          53\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   That is, Zachry contends that the unambiguous language\n\n 2   of Change Order 4 includes an agreement that Zachry\n\n 3   could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied in the\n\n 4   September 9, 2005 design.\n\n 5                 Zachry has also proven as a matter of\n\n 6   law that the Port breached its agreement that Zachry\n\n 7   could use the frozen cutoff wall design embodied in the\n\n 8   September 9, 2005 design.\n\n 9                 And so the issue of whether the Port\n\n10   failed to comply with Change Order 4 should not be\n\n11   submitted either.\n\n12                 If the jury answers no to the Court's\n\n13   Question No. 1, the Court of Appeals will not be able\n\n14   to determine whether one, the jury rejected Zachry's\n\n15   interpretation but found that the Port did not breach\n\n16   Change Order 4, or two, accepted Zachry's\n\n17   interpretation but found that the Port did not breach\n\n18   Change Order 4.\n\n19                 By combining an invalid question, the\n\n20   interpretation of Change Order 4, which should be\n\n21   decided as a matter of law by the Court, with a\n\n22   separate question, whether that agreement was breached,\n\n23   which also should be decided as a matter of law by the\n\n24   Court, the charge obscures the basis for the jury's\n\n25   decision, thus preventing the appellate court from\n\f                                                             54\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   determining whether the jury based its verdict on an\n\n 2   improperly submitted ground.\n\n 3                    This is the Crown Life versus Casteel\n\n 4   case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376467\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376467/crown-life-ins-co-v-casteel/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, pinpoint 390.

As a matter of law, nothing in\n\n18   the unambiguous language of Section 5.10 gave the Port\n\n19   the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n20                    The jury should therefore be instructed\n\n21   in Question No. 2 that nothing in Section 5.10 gave the\n\n22   Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n23   The jury should not be instructed to determine the\n\n24   meaning of Section 5.10.\n\n25                    Zachry will separately request its\n\f                                                          55\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Proposed Issue No. 7 on this issue.\n\n 2                 As a matter of law, nothing in the\n\n 3   unambiguous language of Section 5.22 gave the Port the\n\n 4   right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n 5                 The jury should therefore be instructed\n\n 6   in Question No. 2 that nothing in Section 5.22 gave the\n\n 7   Port the right to issue its October 11, 2005 response.\n\n 8   The jury should not be instructed to determine the\n\n 9   meaning of Section 5.22.\n\n10                 Zachry will separately request its\n\n11   Proposed Issue No. 8 on this issue.\n\n12                 The burden of proof with respect to the\n\n13   Port's right to issue its October 11, 2005 response\n\n14   under Section 5.22 is erroneously placed on Zachry.\n\n15                 Section 5.22 is an affirmative defense\n\n16   in which the Port bears the burden of proof.\n\n17                 THE COURT:   Slow down.\n\n18                 MS.

Such that it would\n\n 8   say, In answering this question, you're instructed that\n\n 9   nothing in Section 5.41, 5.42 or 5.52 gave the Port the\n\n10   right to issue its October 11, 2005 response to the\n\n11   September 9, 2005 frozen cutoff wall design.\n\n12                 Zachry objects to the absence of this\n\n13   instruction, and Zachry will separately request its\n\n14   Proposed Issue No. 9 on this issue.\n\n15                 Furthermore, the issue of Section 5.10\n\n16   and Section 5.22 should be submitted separately.     By\n\n17   combining the Port's affirmative defense under Section\n\n18   5.22 as Zachry's affirmative claim under Section 5.10,\n\n19   the jury charge obscures the basis for the jury's\n\n20   answer.\n\n21                 Zachry has strong arguments as to why as\n\n22   a matter of law the unambiguous language of Section\n\n23   5.10 and Section 5.22 gave the Port no right to issue\n\n24   its revise and resubmit response.\n\n25                 As well as why the Port's October 11,\n\f                                                          58\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   2005 -- 9 -- 5, 2005 response violated Section 5.10 and\n\n 2   Section 5.22 as a matter of law.     And the contract.\n\n 3                 Because Zachry's claim for breach of\n\n 4   Section 5.10 is combined with the Port's affirmative\n\n 5   defense under Section 5.22, and because the question of\n\n 6   the proper interpretation and breach of these clauses\n\n 7   is part of a single question, the charge obscures the\n\n 8   basis for the jury's decision.\n\n 9                 Thus preventing the appellate court from\n\n10   determining whether the jury based its verdict on an\n\n11   improperly submitted ground.     This is again, the\n\n12   Casteel case I cited earlier and Harris County versus\n\n13   Smith.\n\n14                 It will be difficult to show on appeal,\n\n15   if the jury answers no to Question No. 3 -- Question\n\n16   No. 2, whether it did so based on its interpretation of\n\n17   Section 5.10 or 5.22 or whether it believed there was a\n\n18   right to revise -- issue a revise and resubmit, but\n\n19   that it was not shown that the Port had no reasonable\n\n20   basis on which to exercise that right.\n\n21                 Question No. 3, damages for breach of\n\n22   contract with respect to the frozen cutoff wall breach.\n\n23   Zachry objects to the instruction that you may consider\n\n24   amounts, if any, owed as compensation for increased\n\n25   cost to perform the work as a direct result of\n\f                                                          59\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   Port-caused delays, if any.\n\n 2                 Only if you find that such increased\n\n 3   costs were a natural, probable and foreseeable\n\n 4   consequence of the Port's failure to comply, if any.\n\n 5   The Port has never cited a single case for the\n\n 6   proposition that these damages are consequential\n\n 7   damages, and the sovereign immunity statute itself in\n\n 8   no way supports this proposition.\n\n 9                 The element of damages itself in\n\n10   Question No. 3, which is taken from the sovereign\n\n11   immunity statute, Section 271.153, provides that the\n\n12   increased cost to perform the work must be a direct\n\n13   result of Port-caused delays, which shows they must be\n\n14   direct rather than consequential.\n\n15                 Moreover, damages resulting from\n\n16   owner-caused delays are necessarily those which\n\n17   naturally and necessarily flow from a wrongful act and\n\n18   are presumed to have been foreseen or contemplated by\n\n19   the party as a consequence of his wrongful act, and\n\n20   thus are not consequential damages.\n\n21                 That's the Anderson Development Corp.\n\n22   case versus Coastal States Crude Gathering, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">23</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   402, pinpoint 404 to 405.\n\n24                 Zachry objects to the instruction that\n\n25   you are instructed that you may only consider 5.41,\n\f                                                            60\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   5.42 and 5.52 to the extent it imposes requirements\n\n 2   consistent with Section 5.41 only in assessing a\n\n 3   party's state of mind.\n\n 4                   This instruction is an instruction that\n\n 5   was originally made as a limiting instruction to limit\n\n 6   the scope of the admissibility of evidence of these\n\n 7   clauses.    The purpose of the jury charge is to inform\n\n 8   the jury of the controlling law.\n\n 9                   As the pattern jury charge makes clear,\n\n10   the Court must instruct the jury as to its resolution\n\n11   of the meaning of any disputed contract provisions.\n\n12   This is Texas Pattern Jury Charge Section 101.7 in the\n\n13   comments.\n\n14                   Nothing authorizes the Court to point\n\n15   out the significance of a particular type of evidence\n\n16   in the jury charge.\n\n17                   By giving this instruction, the Court\n\n18   comments on the weight of the evidence and nudges the\n\n19   jury towards the Port's theory.\n\n20                   In other words, by giving this\n\n21   instruction, the Court embraces the Port's theory that\n\n22   these clauses can somehow be relevant to Zachry's, or\n\n23   for that matter, the Port's state of mind after the\n\n24   rejection of the frozen cutoff wall occurred on October\n\n25   11, 2009 (sic).\n\f                                                            61\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                   Even though the Court has held that\n\n 2   these provisions are inapplicable to bar Zachry's\n\n 3   damage claim.\n\n 4                   The Court suggests to the jury that\n\n 5   these provisions are relevant to the party's state of\n\n 6   mind and cause undue attention to the Port's theory of\n\n 7   the case.\n\n 8                   Furthermore, the instruction is\n\n 9   erroneous.   The Port's or Zachry's subjective state of\n\n10   mind is irrelevant where, as here, the Court has\n\n11   construed these clauses as a matter of law.\n\n12                   Parole evidence of the party's belief\n\n13   about the meaning of the clauses should not be admitted\n\n14   to vary the Court's construction of these clauses.      The\n\n15   instruction simply allows the Port to evade the Court's\n\n16   legal rulings about the inapplicability of these\n\n17   clauses.\n\n18                   Zachry objects to the inclusion in the\n\n19   definition of active interference of the sentence,\n\n20   Active interference requires more than a simple\n\n21   mistake, error in judgment, lack of total effort or\n\n22   lack of complete diligence.\n\n23                   This instruction is repetitive of the\n\n24   first sentence, which states that active interference\n\n25   means affirmative, willful action that unreasonably\n\f                                                           62\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   interferes with the other party's compliance with the\n\n 2   contract.\n\n 3                  The second sentence adds nothing as all\n\n 4   these matters are covered by the definition of active\n\n 5   interference in the first sentence.    The addition of\n\n 6   the second sentence simply emphasizes the Port's\n\n 7   claimed theory of the case to the jury, and is\n\n 8   therefore a comment on the weight of the evidence and a\n\n 9   nudging instruction designed to encourage the jury to\n\n10   adopt the Port's view of the facts.\n\n11                  Under Texas charge practice, the charge\n\n12   may not define a term like active interference in more\n\n13   general terms and then list specific examples of what\n\n14   the Port believes to be active interference.     This is\n\n15   akin to marshaling one's evidence in the jury charge.\n\n16                  Zachary objects to the inclusion of the\n\n17   Port's mitigation defense as well.    As the Texas\n\n18   Supreme Court has held, under mitigation principles,\n\n19   the long-standing law of this state requires a claimant\n\n20   to mitigate damages if it can do so with trifling\n\n21   expense or reasonable exertions.\n\n22                  That's the Gunn Infiniti versus O'Byrne\n\n23   case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1472904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1472904/gunn-infiniti-inc-v-obyrne/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Page 857 for the pinpoint.\n\n24                  As a result, the jury should be\n\n25   instructed that a party is only required to avoid\n\f                                                            63\n                  Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   damages if it can do so with trifling expense or\n\n 2   reasonable exertions.\n\n 3                   Zachry will separately request its\n\n 4   Proposed Instruction No. 10 on this issue.\n\n 5                   Zachry also objects to the definition of\n\n 6   bad faith.

Zachry objects to Question No. 4,\n\n16   which asks about the percentage of Zachry's damages\n\n17   that were due to delay.\n\n18                   The Port has lost its argument that the\n\n19   no damages for delay clause is a complete bar to\n\n20   Zachry's damages.     It is not entitled to a question\n\n21   inquiring as to the amount of delay damages just in\n\n22   case they lose at trial but win on appeal.\n\n23                   There are myriad alternative issues that\n\n24   the parties may be curious about, that does not mean\n\n25   they are submitted.

Question No. 4 is not such an\n\n14   issue.\n\n15                    Zachry also objects to Question No. 4\n\n16   because it refers to delay or -- delay and hindrance\n\n17   damages.

Accordingly, the amount of this cost\n\n23   is not a controlling issue that should be submitted.\n\n24                    Question No. 6, excuse for the Port's\n\n25   failure to comply.       The affidavits and partial releases\n\f                                                          66\n                Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   of lien are unambiguously only lien releases, and so\n\n 2   Zachry objects that the issue should not be submitted\n\n 3   at all.\n\n 4                   Furthermore, to the extent that the\n\n 5   Court concludes that the partial lien releases are\n\n 6   ambiguous and that there are other reasonable\n\n 7   constructions of the partial lien releases besides\n\n 8   Zachry's construction, which Zachry vigorously\n\n 9   disputes, then the interpretation of the releases the\n\n10   Port previously advanced is at least one reasonable\n\n11   construction.\n\n12                   And we dispute it's reasonable, but if\n\n13   you think that there's more than our instruction, then\n\n14   it's at least one reasonable construction.\n\n15                   In the Port Authority's motion for\n\n16   partial summary judgment based on partial release\n\n17   executed by Zachry, the Port sought only partial\n\n18   summary judgment to the extent of the damages released.\n\n19                   And contended that the lien releases\n\n20   were only partial releases of liens.

Zachry\n\n 5   contends that the Port's fraudulent inducement defense\n\n 6   is barred as a matter of law under the election of\n\n 7   remedies doctrine and therefore should not be\n\n 8   submitted.\n\n 9                    However, to the extent that the Court\n\n10   determines that it is not an issue, that it can be\n\n11   decided as a matter of law, then Zachry is entitled to\n\n12   the submission of its election of remedies defense.\n\n13   Zachry objects to its omission.\n\n14                    Zachry will separately request its\n\n15   Proposed Instruction No. 12 on this issue.\n\n16                    Question No. 9, withholding of the\n\n17   $600,000.     The instruction regarding the withholding of\n\n18   the $600,000 in payment from Zachry is erroneous\n\n19   because it is incomplete.\n\n20                    The instruction fails to give the jury\n\n21   any guidance as to the basis on which the Port was\n\n22   purportedly entitled to withhold the $600,000.     It does\n\n23   not direct the jury to the withholding clause that the\n\n24   question is apparently referring to, Section 6.05.\n\n25                    It does not direct the jury to the\n\f                                                           70\n                 Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1   obligation under the contract that Zachry purportedly\n\n 2   breached.\n\n 3                  Zachry will separately request its\n\n 4   Proposed Instruction No. 13 on this issue.\n\n 5                  Question No. 9 also erroneously places\n\n 6   the burden of proof on Zachry.     The burden of proving\n\n 7   withholding, like offset, is on the party asserting it.\n\n 8                  That's the U.S. versus Use and Benefit\n\n 9   of D'Agostino Excavators, Inc., versus Heyward-Robinson\n\n10   Company case that we've previously given you.     430 F2d\n\n11   1077, 1085 to 86, out of the 2nd Circuit.\n\n12                  And by analogy, offset is an affirmative\n\n13   defense under the Brown versus American Transfer case,\n\n14   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514858\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514858/brown-v-american-transfer-storage-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, pinpoint 936.\n\n15                  And also by analogy, proof of the right\n\n16   to withhold liquidated damages is an affirmative\n\n17   defense under the Borders versus KRLB case, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   357, Page 360 pinpoint.\n\n19                  It is a matter of avoidance under Rule\n\n20   94.

Although\n\n20   Zachry disputes that they should be deducted at all.\n\n21                 Accordingly, regardless, of what happens\n\n22   on the remaining breach of contract theories, Zachry\n\n23   will have a net recovery on its breach of contract\n\n24   claim, and as a matter of law, the Port cannot be the\n\n25   prevailing party.\n\f                                                             73\n                   Plaintiff's Objections to the Court's Charge\n\n\n 1                    And for the foregoing reasons, Zachry\n\n 2   objects to the Court's charge and would like a ruling\n\n 3   on our objections.\n\n 4                            COURT'S RULING\n\n 5                    THE COURT:    Okay.
