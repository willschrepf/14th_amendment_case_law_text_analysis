Roman, 116 F.3d 83 (3d\nCir. 1997), interpreting 28 U.S.C. S 1915(g). Under this\nstatute, popularly known as the \"three strikes\" rule, a\nprisoner may not file a new action or appeal in forma\npauperis (\"I.F.P.\") if, on thr ee or more prior occasions while\nincarcerated or detained, the prisoner has br ought a federal\naction or appeal that was dismissed on the gr ounds that it\nwas frivolous, malicious or fails to state a claim, unless the\nprisoner \"is under imminent danger of serious physical\ninjury.\" We held in Gibbs that\"imminent danger\" is\nmeasured at the time of the alleged incident, not at the\ntime the complaint is filed. 116 F.3d at 86. Three of our\nsister courts of appeals have since rejected our teachings in\nGibbs, holding instead that the court should assess\n\"imminent danger\" as of the time the prisoner's complaint\nis filed and that a prisoner's allegation that he faced danger\nin the past is insufficient to allow him to pr oceed I.F.P.\nMedberry v. Butler, 185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir. 1999);\nAshley v. Dilworth, 147 F.3d 715, 717 (8th Cir. 1998);\nBanos v. O'Guin, 144 F.3d 883, 884-885 (5th Cir. 1998). We\nnow abandon the interpretation set forth in Gibbs and\n\n                               3\n\fadopt that of our sister courts of appeals. W e hold also that\nS 1915(g), as so interpreted, is constitutional.\n\nI.\n\nAppellant Debro Siddiq Abdul-Akbar was most r ecently\nincarcerated by the Delaware Department of Corrections\nfrom June 10, 1994 through May 15, 1999 on state charges\nincluding robbery, conspiracy, assault and shoplifting.\nDuring the time material to Appellant's underlying\nproposed Complaint based on 42 U.S.C. S 1983, he was\nincarcerated at the Sussex Correctional Institute in\nGeorgetown, Delaware. On May 17, 1999, Appellant\nreported to a community confinement center , and on May\n27, 1999, he was released from the custody of the\nDepartment of Corrections.\n\nAppellant has filed at least 180 civil rights or habeas\ncorpus claims. Abdul-Akbar v. Dept. of Corr ections, 910 F.\nSupp. 986, 998 (D. Del. 1995). In Abdul-Akbar v. Watson,\n901 F.2d 329 (3d Cir. 1990), this court reviewed a district\ncourt order barring Appellant from filing any further S 1983\nclaims I.F.P. and held that a district court may enter an\ninjunction precluding a prisoner fromfiling any S1983\nclaims without leave of court and without making certain\ngood faith certifications. 901 F.2d at 333. We stated that\nAbdul-Akbar's \"history of repetitious and frivolous filings\nindicates a clear intent to abuse the courts and the I.F.P.\nprocess.\" Id. at 334. An injunction subsequently was\nentered by the district court. Abdul-Akbar v. Dept. of\nCorrections, 910 F. Supp. at 1009.\n\nOn February 10, 1998, Appellant filed a motion for leave\nto file a S 1983 Complaint, a proposed Complaint and a\nmotion to proceed I.F.P. The pr oposed Complaint alleged\nthat on or about January 9, 1998, prison officials\narbitrarily sprayed Appellant with pepper gas and r efused\nto provide him with medical treatment even though they\nknew that he suffers from asthma. Appellant also claimed\nthat certain prison officials violated his civil rights by\nbelonging to a racist organization, that one defendant failed\nto investigate properly the pepper spray incident, and that\nthe district court judge violated his Sixth Amendment right\n\n                               4\n\fof access to the courts by preventing his complaints from\nbeing heard.\n\nThe district court denied the motion to proceed I.F.P.,\nreasoning that (1) Appellant had brought actions that the\ncourt had dismissed as frivolous on more than three prior\noccasions, and (2) he did not claim to be in imminent\ndanger of serious physical injury.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction over this case under\n28 U.S.C. S 1331. We have jurisdiction because an order\ndenying leave to proceed I.F.P. is a final, collateral order\nappealable under 28 U.S.C. S 1291. The appeal was timely\nfiled. This court reviews de novo issues of statutory\ninterpretation, Pennsylvania Mines Corp. v. Holland, 197\nF.3d 114, 119 n.2 (3d Cir. 1999), and the constitutionality\nof a statute, DeSousa v. Reno, 190 F .3d 175, 180 (3d Cir.\n1999).\n\nII.\n\nThe discretionary power to permit indigent plaintiffs to\nproceed without first paying a filing fee was initially codified\nin the federal statutes in 1892. See Act of July 20, 1892,\nch. 209 1-5, 27 Stat. 252. Congress enacted the I.F.P.\nstatute, currently codified at 28 U.S.C.S 1915, \"to ensure\nthat administrative court costs and filing fees, both of\nwhich must be paid by everyone else who files a lawsuit,\nwould not prevent indigent persons from pursuing\nmeaningful litigation.\" Deutsch v. United States, 67 F.3d\n1080, 1084 (3d Cir. 1995) (citing Denton v. Hernandez, 504\nU.S. 25, 31 (1992)). Congress was also awar e of the\npotential for abuse, and it included a subsection allowing\nfor dismissal of frivolous or malicious actions. Denton, 504\nU.S. at 31.\n\nCongress subsequently enacted the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (\"PLRA\" or \"Act\"), Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110\nStat. 1321 (1996), largely in response to concerns about the\nheavy volume of frivolous prisoner litigation in the federal\ncourts. See 141 Cong. Rec. S14408-01, S14413 (daily ed.\nSept. 27, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (explaining that the\nnumber of prisoner suits filed \"has grown astronomically--\nfrom 6,600 in 1975 to more than 39,000 in 1994\"). In\n\n                               5\n\fenacting the PLRA, Congress concluded that the large\nnumber of meritless prisoner claims was caused by the fact\nthat prisoners easily obtained I.F.P. status and hence were\nnot subject to the same economic disincentives tofiling\nmeritless cases that face other civil litigants. See 141 Cong.\nRec. S7498-01, S7526 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl) (\"Filing frivolous civil rights lawsuits has\nbecome a recreational activity for long-term residents of\nprisons.\"); 141 Cong. Rec. S7498-01, S7524 (daily ed. May\n25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\"[P]risoners will now\n`litigate at the drop of a hat,' simply because they have little\nto lose and everything to gain.\"). To curb this trend, the\nPLRA instituted a number of reforms in the handling of\nprisoner litigation.\n\nAmong other things, the PLRA amended the I.F .P. statute\nas it applies to prisoners. Under the statute as amended, a\nprisoner who is allowed to proceed I.F.P . is not excused\nfrom paying filing fees, but is only excused from pre-paying\nthem in full if they meet certain criteria. The PLRA now\nrequires prisoners who qualify for I.F .P. status to pay by\nway of an initial partial fee, followed by installment\npayments until the entire fee is paid. 28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(1).\nCongress also added S 1915(g), the \"three strikes rule,\"\nwhich limits a prisoner's ability to proceed I.F.P. if the\nprisoner abuses the judicial system by filing frivolous\nactions. Prisoners may avoid the limitation in this\nprovision, however, if they are under \"imminent danger of\nserious physical injury.\"\n\nThis appeal requires us to decide when the existence of\n\"imminent danger\" is to be assessed; specifically, whether it\nis assessed as of the time the complaint is filed, or at some\ntime in the past, even though that danger no longer exists\nwhen the complaint is filed.\n\nToday we abandon the rule announced in Gibbs that\n\"imminent danger\" is assessed at the time of the alleged\nincident. We adopt, instead, the construction set forth by\nthe Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nthat a prisoner may invoke the \"imminent danger\"\nexception only to seek relief from a danger which is\n\"imminent\" at the time the complaint is filed. We conclude\nthat this interpretation is consistent with the plain\n\n                                6\n\flanguage of S 1915(g), with congressional intent and with\nthe legislative purpose of the PLRA as a whole.\n\nIII.\n\nThis is a case of statutory construction, and we begin our\nanalysis with the language of S 1915(g):\n\n        In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or\n        appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under\n        this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or mor e prior\n        occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any\n        facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the\n        United States that was dismissed on the grounds that\n        it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon\n        which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is\n        under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n\nA.\n\nWe now apply settled precepts of statutory construction\nand take as our beginning point a recognition that from the\nearliest times, we have adopted what is called the American\nPlain Meaning Rule exemplified in Caminetti v. United\nStates, 242 U.S. 470, 485 (1917) (internal citations\nomitted):\n\n        It is elementary that the meaning of the statute must,\n        in the first instance, be sought in the language in\n        which the act is framed, and if that is plain, and if the\n        law is within the constitutional authority of the law-\n        making body which passed it, the sole function of the\n        courts is to enforce it according to its terms. Where the\n        language is plain and admits of no more than one\n        meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise and\n        the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no\n        discussion.\n\nIn 1993, the Court made a modern statement of the plain\nmeaning rule: \"Our task is to give effect to the will of\nCongress, and where its will has been expr essed in\nreasonably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be\nregarded as conclusive.\" Negonsett v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99,\n104 (1993). If the language of the statute is plain, the sole\n\n                                7\n\ffunction of the court is to enforce the statute according to\nits terms. United States v. Ron Pair Enters., Inc., 489 U.S.\n235, 241 (1989). The plain meaning is conclusive, therefore,\n\"except in the `rare cases [in which] the literal application\nof a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with\nthe intentions of its drafters.' \" Id. at 242 (quoting Griffin v.\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U.S. 564 (1982)).\n\nB.\n\nWe now apply the ordinary meaning of the words chosen\nby Congress in drafting S 1915(g). The phrase \"in no event\"\nsimply means \"may not.\" This court has pr eviously held\nthat the word \"bring\" in this context plainly refers to the\ntime when the civil action is initiated. Gibbs v. Ryan, 160\nF.3d 160, 162 (3d Cir. 1998). Putting the phrases together,\nthe first clause of S 1915(g) obviously means \"a prisoner\nmay not file a new civil complaint.\" In the or dinary sense of\nthe words, this clause refers temporally to the time the new\ncomplaint is filed. The clause \"unless he is in imminent\ndanger of serious physical injury\" is an exception to the\npreclusive effect of the statute. But the exception is cast in\nthe present tense, not in the past tense, and the word \"is\"\nin the exception refers back to the same point in time as\nthe first clause, i.e., the time of filing. The statute\ncontemplates that the \"imminent danger\" will exist\ncontemporaneously with the bringing of the action.\nSomeone whose danger has passed cannot reasonably be\ndescribed as someone who \"is\" in danger , nor can that past\ndanger reasonably be described as \"imminent.\" The court\nso held in Ashley v. Dilworth, 147 F .3d 715, 717 (8th Cir.\n1998):\n\n        As the statute's use of the present tense verbs`bring'\n        and `is' demonstrates, an otherwise ineligible prisoner\n        is only eligible to proceed IFP if he is in imminent\n        danger at the time of filing. Allegations that the\n        prisoner has faced imminent danger in the past ar e\n        insufficient to trigger this exception to S 1915(g) and\n        authorize the prisoner to pay the filing fee on the\n        installment plan.\n\nSee also Medberry v. Butler, 185 F.3d 1189, 1193 (11th Cir.\n1999) (\"Congress' use of the present tense in S 1915(g)\n\n                               8\n\fconfirms that a prisoner's allegation that he faced imminent\ndanger sometime in the past is an insufficient basis to\nallow him to proceed in forma pauperis . . . .\"); Banos v.\nO'Guin, 144 F.3d 883, 885 (5th Cir . 1998) (\"[T]he language\nof S 1915(g), by using the present tense, clearly refers to the\ntime when the action or appeal is filed or the motion for IFP\nstatus is made.\"). Taking both clauses together, the statute\nplainly means that a prisoner is not permitted to file his\ncomplaint unless he is, at that time, under imminent\ndanger. Viewed from the Plain Meaning Rule, we interpret\n\"is under imminent danger\" to relate to the time when \"a\nprisoner bring[s] a civil action.\"\n\nIV.\n\nReinforcing the interpretation of the statute by\napplication of the Plain Meaning Rule is an analysis of\nlanguage found in other portions of the PLRA. For example,\nanother section of the Act, S 1915(b)(4), pr ovides:\n\n        In no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing\n        a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment\n        for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no\n        means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.\n\n28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(4) (emphasis added). As in subsection\n(g), this provision begins with the exhortation\"in no event\nshall,\" and, as in subsection (g), it describes a necessary\ncondition by using the present tense of the operative verb.\nSection 1915(b)(4) plainly means that the courts may not\nprohibit a prisoner from filing a new complaint for the\nreason that he does not possess any assets at the time of\nfiling. The temporal reference point for the verb \"has\" is the\ntime of filing, the time at which the fee is due.\n\nOther provisions support this construction by focusing\non the time of filing. Section 1997e(a) of T itle 42, amended\nby the PLRA, requires that the plaintif f exhaust\nadministrative remedies, but only if the plaintiff is a\nprisoner at the time of filing. Greig v. Goord, 169 F.3d 165,\n167 (2d Cir. 1999). Similarly, the applicability of the\npersonal injury requirement of 42 U.S.C.S 1997e(e) turns\non the plaintiff 's status as a prisoner , not at the time of the\nincident, but when the lawsuit is filed. Harris v. Garner,\n\n                                9\n\f216 F.3d 970, 974-975 (11th Cir. 2000). Finally, the need\nfor the district court to screen a complaint in a civil action\nfiled by a prisoner, as requir ed by 28 U.S.C. S 1915A, looks\nto the plaintiff 's status when the case isfiled. Johnson v.\nHill, 965 F. Supp. 1487, 1488 n.2 (E.D. V a. 1997).\n\nV.\n\nAppellant argues that requiring pr oof of imminent danger\nas of the time of filing is inconsistent with Congress' intent.\nHaving applied the American Plain Meaning Rule and\nhaving determined that there is no ambiguity, we are not\nrequired to answer this contention of the Appellant.\nNevertheless, we perceive the congressional intent as clear\nwhen we examine the purpose of the entire PLRA.\n\nAs noted above, Congress enacted the PLRA in or der to\nlimit the filing of frivolous and vexatious prisoner lawsuits.\nTo accomplish this, Congress curtailed the ability of\nprisoners to take advantage of the privilege offiling I.F.P.\nThe \"three strikes\" rule added by the PLRA supplied a\npowerful economic incentive not to file frivolous lawsuits or\nappeals. In stark terms, it declared that the I.F.P. privilege\nwill not be available to prisoners who have, on thr ee\noccasions, abused the system by filing frivolous or\nmalicious lawsuits or appeals, no matter how meritorious\nsubsequent claims may be.\n\nIt is important to note that S 1915(g) does not block a\nprisoner's access to the federal courts. It only denies the\nprisoner the privilege of filing before he has acquired the\nnecessary filing fee. Appellant argues that a prisoner\nsubject to the \"three strikes\" rule, but who does not\nestablish \"imminent danger,\" could for ever lose his ability\nto bring his suit as a practical matter because of the\ndifficulties of obtaining the money, the application of the\nstatute of limitations, or the possible loss of necessary\nevidence. This argument attempts to pr ove too much. It\noverlooks the fact that prisoners may seek r elief in state\ncourt, where limitations on filing I.F .P. may not be as strict.\nPotentially negative consequences in federal courts, as\ndistinguished from state courts, ar e precisely the\nconsequences intended by Congress. The outcome predicted\n\n                               10\n\fby Appellant is, for better or for worse, exactly the result\nthe PLRA intends.\n\nRecognizing that it could take prisoners a significant\nperiod of time to obtain the filing fee in some cases,\nCongress created a limited exception aimed at preventing\nfuture harms, and did so through the use of the word\n\"imminent.\" \"Imminent\" dangers ar e those dangers which\nare about to occur at any moment or are impending. See\nWEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITYDICTIONARY 611 (1984).\nBy using the term \"imminent,\" Congr ess indicated that it\nwanted to include a safety valve for the \"thr ee strikes\" rule\nto prevent impending harms, not those har ms that had\nalready occurred. The imminent danger exception allows\nthe district court to permit an otherwise barr ed prisoner to\nfile a complaint I.F.P. if the prisoner could be subject to\nserious physical injury and does not then have the r equisite\nfiling fee.\n\nIn contrast, under the Gibbs construction, the prisoner\nneed only show that he was subject to imminent danger at\nthe time of the alleged incident. By definition, an imminent\nthreat of serious physical injury always exists in the\nmoments before any such injury is inflicted. Thus, under\nthe Gibbs approach, any time that an otherwise disqualified\nprisoner alleges that any threat of physical injury occurred\nat any time, that prisoner automatically qualifies for the\nimminent danger exception. The Gibbs interpr etation of the\nimminent danger exception thereby swallows the rule. Like\nevery other court of appeals that has consider ed this issue,\nwe refuse to conclude that with one hand Congr ess\nintended to enact a statutory rule that would r educe the\nhuge volume of prisoner litigation, but, with the other\nhand, it engrafted an open-ended exception that would\neviscerate the rule.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The dissent devotes much effort to asserting that, even under our time\nof filing construction, Appellant's S 1983 Complaint satisfied the terms\nof\nthe imminent danger exception because the Complaint, under the\ndissent's liberal construction, alleged an ongoing risk of serious\nphysical\ninjury. Importantly, at no point in the present litigation did Appellant\nseek to rely on an ongoing danger theory, even through the able counsel\nappointed by this court for purposes of this appeal. Inasmuch as the\n\n                               11\n\fThis is not to suggest that we would criticize any statute\nor judicially-created legal precept that would permit any\nprisoner, even a frequent filer, to file such a complaint I.F.P.\nSuch a notion is entirely compatible with the precept that\nfor any injury, there should be a remedy. But we do not\nwrite in the abstract here, nor do we write on a clean slate.\nCongress has deliberately decided to legislate on this\nsubject by proclaiming, as public policy, a determination to\nreduce prisoner litigation in the federal courts. As citizens,\nwe may disagree with the congressional wisdom, but as\njudges, knowing the clearly stated legislative purpose, we\nmay not disembowel the legislative act. Federal courts,\nunlike state common law King's Bench courts, do not have\nunlimited power and authority. We are limited to that which\nhas been granted by Congress. What Congr ess gives it may\nalso take away. The ability to proceed I.F .P. is not a\nconstitutional right. Congress granted the right to proceed\nI.F.P. in 1892, and it has the power to limit this statutorily\ncreated right. Here it has taken away our ability as judges\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndissent uses our silence with respect to an issue not raised by the\nparties to argue that our construction of the imminent danger exception\neliminates a prisoner's ability to satisfy the imminent danger exception\nby alleging an ongoing risk of serious physical injury, we respond only\nby stressing that we by no means intend such a result.\n\nAt all events, we doubt whether the allegations in Appellant's S 1983\nComplaint suffice to establish such an ongoing danger. Even under a\nliberal reading of Appellant's pleading, it is evident that Appellant's\nallegations center on an incident that occurr ed on or about January 9,\n1998, when a prison official allegedly sprayed Appellant with pepper gas.\nApp. 9-10. Appellant does not identify any further incidents occurring\nafter that date. Moreover, although Appellant alleges that he experienced\nseveral other acts of physical harassment by dif ferent prison officials,\nthese events not only all pre-date the January 9th incident, but also\nappear entirely unconnected to it, and thus undermine the dissent's\nclaim that the danger to Appellant was ongoing. Finally, while Appellant\ndoes allege that he complained for a year about the use of pepper gas\n(App. 10), and that prison officials engaged in\"continuing harassment,\nploits [sic] to hurt or kill [him], and other forms of retaliation,\" (App.\n8,\n9) such generalized allegations strike us as insufficient to connect the\nseparate incidents mentioned above into a patter n of threats of serious\nphysical injury that are ongoing.\n\n                               12\n\fto grant I.F.P. status to a \"thr ee strikes\" prisoner, no matter\nhow meritorious his or her subsequent claims may be,\nunless the prisoner \"is under imminent danger of serious\nphysical injury\" when he or she \"bring[s] a civil action.\"\nCongress has held trump here, and it has dealt a hand. As\njudges we must play it.\n\nVI.\n\nAppellant also mounts the argument that S 1915(g), as we\ninterpret it, would offend the equal pr otection guarantee\nimplied in the Fifth Amendment by improperly burdening a\nprisoner's \"fundamental right of access\" to the courts.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. In his reply brief, Appellant contends for the first time that this\ninterpretation of the statute runs counter to the protections assured by\nthe Eighth Amendment. Appellant argues that\"[t]he right to be free from\nserious physical injury while in prison is sur ely as fundamental as the\nright to divorce,\" citing as authority Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371\n(1971), and that, therefore, he is entitled to a waiver of filing fees as\na\nmatter of law. We will not discuss the merits of this contention because\nAbdul-Akbar waived this argument by not raising it in his opening brief.\nGhana v. Holland, 226 F.3d 175, 180 (3d Cir. 2000). \"[The argument in\nthe reply brief comes] too late . . . . Rule 28(a)(5) of the Federal Rules\nof\nAppellate Procedure and our Local Rule 28.1(a) require appellants to set\nforth the issues raised on appeal and to present an argument in support\nof those issues in their opening brief.\" Id. ; see also Kost v.\nKozakiewicz,\n1 F.3d 176, 182 (3d Cir. 1993) (\"It is well settled that if an appellant\nfails\nto comply with these requirements on a particular issue, the appellant\nnormally has abandoned and waived that issue on appeal and it need\nnot be addressed by the court of appeals.\").\n\nThe dissent contends that Abdul-Akbar's waiver should be ignored\nbecause an assessment of the importance of a claimed constitutional\ninterest is an implicit part of any equal pr otection or due process\ninquiry\ndetermining the level of scrutiny that will apply to a challenged\ngovernment action. The dissent agrees with Abdul-Akbar that the right\nto be free from serious physical injury is just as weighty as the right to\na divorce at issue in Boddie, and would hold that such a right represents\na fundamental interest for Boddie purposes. Furthermore, the dissent\nalso points to several other underlying rights, including the First\nAmendment right to free exercise of r eligion, that are not at issue in\nthe\ninstant case, but that the dissent would also pr esumably treat as\nfundamental interests under Boddie. What the dissent fails to recognize,\n\f13\n\fMoreover, he argues that we must apply strict scrutiny in\nconsidering this contention and that, alternatively, even\nunder rational basis scrutiny, the statute, as we interpret\nit, does not pass constitutional muster because it is not\nrationally related to a legitimate gover nmental interest.\n\nA.\n\nAlthough the Fifth Amendment contains no Equal\nProtection Clause, \"the Fifth Amendment's Due Process\nClause prohibits the Federal Government from engaging in\ndiscrimination that is `so unjustifiable as to be violative of\ndue process.' \" Schlesinger v. Ballar d, 419 U.S. 498, 500 n.3\n(1975) (quoting Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499\n(1954)). Accordingly, the Court has construed the Fifth\nAmendment to contain an equal protection guarantee. See,\ne.g., Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.S. 614, 616\n(1991). Fifth Amendment equal protection claims are\nexamined under the same principles that apply to such\nclaims under the Fourteenth Amendment. Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 217 (1995)\n(citations omitted). Statutes that substantially bur den a\nfundamental right or target a suspect class must be\nreviewed under \"strict scrutiny;\" that is, to survive, they\nmust be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\ngovernmental interest. Plyler v. Doe , 457 U.S. 202, 216-217\n(1982). Conversely, if a statute neither bur dens a\nfundamental right nor targets a suspect class, it does not\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection\nClause, as incorporated through the Fifth Amendment's\nDue Process Clause, so long as it bears a rational\nrelationship to some legitimate end. Romer v. Evans, 517\nU.S. 620, 631 (1996).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nhowever, is that the importance of the underlying right is largely\nimmaterial to the question whether that right is a fundamental interest\nfor Boddie purposes. As we discuss infra in Part VI.B., an underlying\nconstitutional entitlement rises to the level of a Boddie fundamental\ninterest only when the government blocks the sole legal means for\nsafeguarding that entitlement, and not simply because the interest itself\nis a weighty one.\n\n                               14\n\fThis requires us first to determine whether Appellant is\na member of a suspect class or whether a fundamental\nright is implicated. Neither prisoners nor indigents are\nsuspect classes. See, e.g., Pryor v. Brennan, 914 F.2d 921,\n923 (7th Cir. 1990) (noting that prisoners do not constitute\na suspect class); Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S 297, 323 (1980)\n(noting that poverty is not a suspect classification). Nor has\nAppellant argued before us that indigent prisoners,\nspecifically, frequent filer indigent prisoners, are a suspect\nclass. We then must inquire whether the\"time of filing\"\nconstruction infringes upon one of Appellant's fundamental\nrights.\n\nB.\n\nAppellant contends that the \"time of filing\" interpretation\nadopted by our sister courts of appeals and adopted by us\ntoday unconstitutionally burdens his fundamental right of\naccess to the courts by requiring him to pay fees. But the\nright of access to the courts is not absolute. United States\nv. Kras, 409 U.S. 434, 450 (1972). Courts pr esented with\nthis issue have consistently held that merely r equiring a\nprisoner to pay filing fees in a civil case does not, standing\nalone, violate that prisoner's right of meaningful access to\nthe courts. See, e.g., Rivera v. Allin, 144 F.3d 719, 724\n(11th Cir. 1998); Roller v. Gunn, 107 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.\n1997). We agree. Section 1915(g) does not prevent a\nprisoner with \"three strikes\" fromfiling a civil action; he or\nshe is simply unable to enjoy the benefits of pr oceeding\nI.F.P. and must pay the fees at the time of filing instead of\nunder the installment plan. And, given the right of\nCongress to limit the power of federal courts, it cannot be\nsaid that limiting the temporal aspect of the exception to\nthe \"three strikes\" rule infringes upon Appellant's right of\naccess to the courts.\n\nThe Court has recognized only a \"narr ow category of civil\ncases in which the State must provide access to its judicial\nprocesses without regard to a party's ability to pay court\nfees.\" M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 113 (1996). An\nunconditional right of access exists for civil cases only\nwhen denial of a judicial forum would implicate a\nfundamental human interest -- such as the ter mination of\n\n                               15\n\fparental rights or the ability to obtain a divorce. Id. at 116-\n117; Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 382-383 (1971).\nExamples of interests that the Court has held do not rise to\nthis level are bankruptcy filings, Kras , 409 U.S. at 444-445,\nand welfare benefit determinations, Ortwein v. Schwab, 410\nU.S. 656, 659 (1973).\n\nIn the seminal case of Boddie, the Court emphasized that\nthe deprivation of due process emanated fr om \"the State's\nrefusal to admit these appellants to its courts, the sole\nmeans in Connecticut for obtaining a divorce, [and that this]\nmust be regarded as the equivalent of denying them an\nopportunity to be heard upon their claimed right to a\ndissolution of their marriages.\" 401 U.S. at 380-381\n(emphasis added). Unlike the parties in Boddie , Appellant is\nnot precluded from filing his S 1983 Complaint in another\ncourt system that does not have a \"three strikes\" provision.\nState courts have concurrent jurisdiction overS 1983 cases.\nHowlett v. Rose, 496 U.S. 356, 358 (1990). Appellant can\nseek I.F.P. status under Delawar e law because it does not\nhave a parallel \"three strikes\" rule. See generally 10 Del. C.\nS 8802 (I.F.P. statute). A state court provides a fully\nadequate forum for the vindication of civil rights claims.\nSee generally Tafflin v. Levitt, 493 U.S. 455, 458 (1990)\n(\"[S]tate courts have inherent authority, and are thus\npresumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising\nunder the laws of the United States.\"). Because neither\nDelaware substantive law nor Delaware court rules\nprevented him, as an indigent prison litigant, from\npursuing his claims, we do not agree that strict scrutiny is\nthe appropriate test. We therefor e examine S 1915(g) using\nrational basis review as have our sister courts of appeals.\nSee, e.g., Rodriguez v. Cook, 169 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th Cir.\n1999); White v. Colorado, 157 F.3d 1226, 1234 (10th Cir.\n1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1008 (1999); Wilson v. Yaklich,\n148 F.3d 596, 604 (6th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S.\n1139 (1999); Rivera, 144 F.3d at 727; Carson v. Johnson,\n112 F.3d 818, 822 (5th Cir. 1997).\n\nC.\n\nWe are satisfied that our interpr etation of S 1915(g)\npasses the rational basis test. Appellant focuses on the\n\n                               16\n\fright of access to the courts, arguing thatS 1915(g)'s\npurpose and effect is to prevent him and other frequent filer\nprisoner indigents from filing civil lawsuits. In addressing\nthis contention, we must first examine the legislative\npurpose.\n\nAs discussed above, the legislation was aimed at the\nskyrocketing numbers of claims filed by prisoners -- many\nof which are emotionally driven but legally deficient -- and\nthe corresponding burden those filings have placed on the\nfederal courts. Congress sought to put in place economic\nincentives that would prompt prisoners to \"stop and think\"\nbefore filing a complaint.3 The \"three strikes\" rule thus\nserves as a rational deterrent mechanism, for cing potential\nprisoner litigants to examine whether their filings have any\nmerit before they are filed, and disqualifying frequent filers\nwho have failed in the past to carefully evaluate their\nclaims prior to filing.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Congress's rationale for placing the fee requirements on prisoners is\ncaptured in the statements of Senator Jon Kyl:\n\n           Section 2 will require prisoners to pay a very small share of the\n           large burden they place on the Federal judicial system by paying a\n           small filing fee upon commencement of lawsuits. In doing so, the\n           provision will deter frivolous inmate lawsuits. The modest\nmonetary\n           outlay will force prisoners to think twice about the case and not\njust\n           file reflexively. Prisoners will have to make the same decision\nthat\n           law-abiding Americans must make: Is the lawsuit worth the price?\n           Criminals should not be given a special privilege that other\n           Americans do not have . . . . The volume of prisoner litigation\n           represents a large burden on the judicial system, which is already\n           overburdened by increases in nonprisoner litigation. Yet prisoners\n           have very little incentive not to file nonmeritorious lawsuits.\nUnlike\n        other prospective litigants who seek poor person status, prisoners\n        have all the necessities of life supplied, including the materials\n        required to bring their lawsuits. For a prisoner who qualifies for\n        poor person status, there is no cost to bring a suit and,\ntherefore,\n        no incentive to limit suits to cases that have some chance of\n        success. The filing fee is small enough not to deter a prisoner\nwith\n        a meritorious claim, yet large enough to deter frivolous claims\nand\n        multiple filings.\n\n141 CONG. REC. S7498-01, S7526 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of\n\fSen. Kyl) (citation omitted).\n\n                                17\n\fDeterring frivolous prisoner filings in the federal courts\nfalls within the realm of Congress' legitimate interests, and\nthe interpretation we adopt today is rationally related to the\nachievement of that interest. \"[T]he right of access to federal\ncourts is not a free floating right, but rather is subject to\nCongress' Article III power to set limits on federal\nlegislation.\" Roller, 107 F.3d at 231. Although it had the\npower to do so, Congress did not repeal any particular\ncause-of-action available to prisoners. Rather , Congress\nchanged only the rules regarding I.F .P. status. Under\nS 1915(g), prisoners are still able tofile civil actions; they\nare merely prohibited from enjoying I.F.P. status. Lyon v.\nKrol, 127 F.3d 763, 765 (8th Cir . 1997); Carson, 112 F.3d\nat 821. Preventing frequent filers fr om obtaining fee waivers\nis rationally related to the legitimate gover nment interest of\ndeterring frivolous lawsuits because \"Congr ess is no more\ncompelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it\nis to provide unlimited access to them.\" Roller, 107 F.3d at\n231. Although the dissent claims that the \"thr ee strikes\"\nrule embodied in S 1915(g) is too blunt an instrument and\nis insufficiently targeted to arrest frivolous filings, we have\nalways recognized that constitutional constraints \"require[ ]\nneither a perfect nor even best availablefit\" between a\nstatute's goal and the means employed in that statute to\nfurther that goal. United States v. Mariani, 212 F.3d 761,\n774 (3d Cir. 2000) (en banc).\n\nCongress included an exception to the \"thr ee strikes\" rule\nfor those cases in which it appears that judicial action is\nneeded as soon as possible to prevent serious physical\ninjuries from occurring in the meantime. Thus,S 1915(g)\nrationally balances the economic deterrence rationale\nbehind the \"three strikes\" rule with the need for those\nprisoners who remain in danger of futur e grievous harm to\nbe able to file immediately. Accordingly, we hold that our\ninterpretation of S 1915(g) does not violate equal protection\nconcepts embodied in the Fifth Amendment.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWe have considered all contentions pr esented by the\nparties and conclude that no further discussion is\nnecessary.\n\n                               18\n\fThe judgment of the district court will be affir med.4\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. The court acknowledges with appreciation the able pro bono\nrepresentation of Appellant by the lawfirm of Jenner & Block.\n\n                               19\n\fMANSMANN, Circuit Judge, dissenting, with whom Judges\nSloviter, Nygaard and McKee join.\n\nI.\n\nToday the majority interprets and applies the \"three\nstrikes\" rule of the Prison Litigation Refor m Act of 1995\n(\"PLRA\"), 28 U.S.C. S 1915(g), in a manner destined to bar\nthe doors of our courts against a disfavored gr oup --\nindigent prisoners who have resorted unsuccessfully to civil\nlitigation -- even with respect to meritorious litigation that\nmay be their sole means of vindicating a fundamental right.\nBecause I believe that this case falls within a statutory\nexception, as properly interpreted in Gibbs,1 and that the\nstatute, as interpreted and applied by the majority,\nsubstantially burdens fundamental rights without narrowly\nserving a compelling governmental inter est, I respectfully\ndissent.\n\nIn 1990 we struck down a District Court injunction\nbarring in forma pauperis (\"IFP\") suits by the same\nAppellant before us today as violative of the constitutional\nright of access to the courts, and we directed instead entry\nof an injunction that would permit such suits subject to\ncertification and review calculated to test for frivolity. See\nAbdul Akbar v. Watson, 901 F.2d 329 (3d Cir. 1990). While\nnot expressly repudiating our holding in Watson, the\nmajority nonetheless essentially holds that what the\nDistrict Court was then precluded from doing by the\nConstitution it is now required to do by statute. Today's\nholding therefore places us at odds with a well-established\nline of cases exemplified by Watson.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Gibbs v. Roman, 116 F.3d 83 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n2. In both Watson and our prior decision in In re Packer Avenue\nAssociates, 884 F.2d 745 (3d Cir. 1989), we adopted the approach of the\nDistrict of Columbia Circuit in the leading case of In re Green, 669 F.2d\n779 (D.C. Cir. 1981). See also Procup v. Strickland, 792 F.2d 1069,1072\nn.6 (11th Cir. 1986) (en banc) (\"Several courts have held that a total ban\non all IFP filings by a particular litigant as a sanction for abuse is\nimpermissible.\") (citing Green and cases from Second, Ninth and Tenth\nCircuits); Joseph T. Lukens, The Prison Litigation Reform Act: Three\nStrikes and You're Out of Court -- It May Be Effective, But Is It\n\n                               20\n\fThis case unfortunately illustrates the maxim that bad\ncases may sometimes make bad law. This Appellant has\nclearly abused the IFP system, filing some 200 cases, most\nwithout merit. The three strikes rule as interpreted by the\nmajority, however, will burden other would-be litigants who\nhave not filed 200 cases, and whose \"strikes\" were racked\nup without any bad faith or abuse.3 It will, moreover, bar\npotentially meritorious litigation at the filing stage, with no\nopportunity for substantive review or appeal.\n\nII.\n\nThe principal holding announced by the majority is not\nvery far-reaching. It rejects a statement in our earlier Gibbs\ncase to the effect that imminent danger is to be determined\nas of the time of the incident complained of, and joins with\nour sister courts of appeals that have held that danger\nmust exist at the time the Complaint or appeal isfiled. I\njoined in, and continue to adhere to, the able opinion of\nJudge Garth in Gibbs. In Gibbs we held that a prisoner who\nalleged two prior attacks by inmates and death thr eats,\neach related to his identification as a gover nment\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nConstitutional?, 70 Temp. L. Rev. 471, n. 90-91 (Summer 1997)\n(providing extensive citations to circuit court cases requiring that\ninjunctions be narrowly tailored to pr eserve access for legitimate\nclaims).\nThe sole difference between the pr eclusive effect of injunctions held\nimpermissible in the cited cases and the statutory bar of section 1915(g)\nis that the latter includes a narrow exception (extremely narrow, as\ninterpreted by the majority) which is patently insufficient to safeguard\nthe broad scope of rights jeopardized by the IFP ban. Cf. Procup, 792\nF.2d at 1074 (Clark, J., concurring) (construing limitation of IFP for\nabusive prisoner litigant to \"claims alleging actual or threatened\nphysical\nharm\" to be \"an unconstitutional denial of access\").\n\n3. Although dismissals for failure to state a claim do not necessarily\nsignify abuse, they nonetheless count as \"strikes\" for purposes of\nsection 1915(g). Moreover, the many procedural and substantive hurdles\nerected in the path of civil rights claims against government actors might\neasily trip up a pro se litigant with a bona fide claim. The majority's\nrepeated characterization of the statutory bar as applying only to\nprisoners who \"abuse\" the judicial system byfiling frivolous actions is\ntherefore somewhat misleading.\n\n                               21\n\finformant, and who alleged that his \"life[was] in constant\ndanger\", provided sufficient allegations of \"imminent\ndanger\" to survive the \"three strikes\" rule. Although our\nprincipal holding was that \"a complaint alleging imminent\ndanger . . . must be credited as having satisfied the\nthreshold criterion of S 1915(g) unless[that] element is\nchallenged\", we also stated that \"the pr oper focus when\nexamining an inmate's complaint filed pursuant to\nS 1915(g) must be the imminent danger faced by the inmate\nat the time of the alleged incident, and not at the time the\ncomplaint was filed.\" 116 F.3d at 86.\n\nNo clear intent may be discerned from section 1915(g)'s\nuse of the present tense (\"unless the prisoner is under\nimminent danger\"), because the same subsection elsewhere\nemploys the present tense in refer ence to what are\nexpressly recognized as past events (\"if the prisoner has\nbrought an action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on the\ngrounds that it is frivolous, malicious or fails to state a\nclaim . . .\"). This erroneous combination of tenses renders\nthe statutory provision ambiguous, and I believe that such\nambiguity must be resolved in favor of pr eserving the right\nof access to the courts for prisoners threatened with bodily\ninjury.\n\nAs the majority has acknowledged, the purpose of the\nexception is to \"prevent[ ] futur e harms.\" Supra at 11. This\npurpose is best served by a liberal interpretation of the\nexception, one which gives scope to -- and so facilitates --\nthe deterrent effect of the subsequent damages remedy\navailable under section 1983. See City of Riverside v.\nRivera, 477 U.S. 561, 575 (1986) (plurality) (stating that\n\"the damages a plaintiff recovers contribute significantly to\nthe deterrence of civil rights violations in the future\"). Cf.\nGibbs (rejecting argument that \"suit for damages rather\nthan injunctive relief . . . was not seeking to protect . . .\nphysical safety\"). 116 F.3d at 85. Contrary to the majority's\nassertion, the exception as interpreted by Gibbs does not\n\"eviscerate\" the three strikes rule. A would-be litigant must\nplead imminent danger of serious physical injury (rather\nthan a deprivation of procedural, associational, religious or\nother rights), and the court must determine that such\ndanger is or was in fact present if such allegation is\n\n                               22\n\fcontroverted. Moreover, as discussed below, section\n1915(g)'s potential encroachment into important\n 665<!>constitutional rights also counsels for a br oad\n\ninterpretation of the exception. Finally, the importance of\npresenting an appropriately lenient interpretation in this en\nbanc opinion -- which will guide the district courts in their\ndecisions on hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoner filings\n-- is heightened by the preclusive natur e of section 1915(g).\nThat is, the denial of in forma pauperis status and resultant\ndismissal of prisoner litigation made pursuant ther eto will\nbe effectively unreviewable, as a truly indigent plaintiff will\nno more be able to afford the r equisite filing costs for\nappeal of that dismissal than for the underlying action.\n\nIII.\n\nWhile I disagree with the majority's rejection of the\nstandard enunciated in Gibbs for one which determines the\nexistence of imminent danger at the time the Complaint or\nappeal is filed, it is the majority's application of that\nstandard to the facts of this case, and implicitly to those of\nGibbs, that I find considerably more tr oubling.\n\nThe majority appears simply to assume that its holding\nthat imminent danger must be assessed at the time offiling\nis dispositive of this case, and that Appellant was not in\nsuch danger. In so assuming, the majority seriously\nundermines protection of physically endangered prisoners\nby paying too little heed to ongoing threats.\n\nThe majority's lengthy explication of statutory tense\nnotwithstanding, an equally crucial question of\ninterpretation under section 1915(g) concer ns the meaning\nof \"imminent danger\". The majority's definition of\n\"imminent\" dangers as those \"which ar e about to occur at\nany moment or impending\", supra at 11, is far too\nrestrictive. In a real-world prison setting, the timing of an\nattack cannot be so neatly predicted. It may be that an\nongoing threat of danger looms over a prisoner for an\nextended period. At any given moment, the har m might not\nbe \"about to\" occur; then again, it might. Such is the\nnature of \"danger\". It involves risk, not certainty.\n\n                                23\n\fThe phrase \"imminent danger\" is not defined in the\nPLRA. It may be instructive, however, to consider the\ndefinition accorded the same phrase in other contexts. For\nexample, under the Eighth Amendment prison authorities\nmust protect prisoners not only from curr ent threats, but\nalso from \"sufficiently imminent dangers\"; the courts have\ndefined that phrase as encompassing those dangers\"likely\nto cause harm in the `next week, month, or year.' \" Horton\nv. Cockrell, 70 F.3d 397, 401 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting\nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25 (1993); Payne v. Collins,\n986 F. Supp. 1036, 1052 (E.D. Tex. 1997) (observing that\nthis approach includes review of the actions taken to\nalleviate the threat).4 In discussing \"imminent harm\" in the\npreliminary injunction context, we have held that standard\nmet where the potential harm was not\"uncertain or\nspeculative\", but might be expected to occur before the\nthreat could otherwise be averted.5 In determining\nstanding, the courts have framed their inquiry into the\n\"immediate threat\" as one encompassing consideration of\nthe likelihood of an ongoing danger, as evidenced by past\nevents. See, e.g., O'Shea v. Littleton , 414 U.S. 488, 496\n(1974) (\"past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there\nis a real and immediate threat of r epeated injury\").\n\nIndeed, this conception of imminent danger as\nencompassing an ongoing threat has been explicitly\nrecognized by one of our sister circuits.

Hargett, 1998 WL 378369 *3 (Apr. 27, 1998\nN.D. Miss.) (finding \"sufficiently imminent danger of future physical\nharm\" during prisoner's \"tenure\" in light of continuing conditions).\n\n5.

Another statute similarly \"defines the\nthreat of `imminent danger' as the existence of a condition . . . which\ncould `[r]easonably be expected to cause substantial harm . . . before\nsuch condition . . . can be abated.' \" Hodel v.

Nonetheless,\nour precedents require us to construe pleadings, and\nespecially pro se pleadings, liberally. See Gibbs, 116 F.3d at\n86 (observing that \"[u]nder our liberal pleading rules\" all\nallegations should be construed \"in favor of the\ncomplainant\") (citations omitted). Reading the Complaint in\nthe light most favorable to Appellant, I find his claimed\npredicament alarming.\n\nAppellant, a black inmate, brought this action seeking,\ninter alia, an injunction against white prison guar ds \"from\ncontinuing . . . plots to hurt or kill [him]\". App. 8. The\nguards in question are asserted to be racists who \"don't\naccept . . . Black people as human beings\" and thus do not\nrespect rights of any black person. App. 13. Appellant is a\nparticular target of the guards' animus, as he asserts they\nare engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against Appellant\nfor filing complaints against them for past abuses. App. 9.\n\nGuards have made a practice of using pepper gas\nroutinely to punish inmates for failing to obey orders or for\n\"saying something an officer don't like.\" App. 10. \"[M]ajor\nproblems happen on the white [guards'] shifts, especially\nBlack inmate's [sic] getting sprayed arbitrarily with pepper\ngas.\" App. 13. Although Appellant complained for over a\nyear about the abuse of pepper gas, no restraint was placed\non the use of pepper gas. App. 10, 11.\n\nDefendants \"know [Appellant has] asthma . .. and\nthey've seen [him] suffer whenever that pepper gas has\nbeen sprayed.\" App. 12. The danger faced by Appellant was\nnot limited to attacks directed against him. Rather, the use\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. See also Choyce v. Dominguez, 160 F .3d 1068 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(remanding for reconsideration of imminent danger determination where\nprisoner alleged incident complained of \"was only one episode in an\nongoing pattern of threats and violence\" in retaliation for prior\nlitigation).\n\n                               25\n\fof pepper gas \"effects [sic] every inmate . . . in the area\".\nFor example, in December, 1997, Appellant was exposed to\npepper gas directed at other inmates and was taken to the\nhospital with an asthma attack. App. 10-11.\n\nIn September or October of 1997, in a \"deliberate attempt\nto have [Appellant] hurt or killed\", a guar d told an inmate\nthat Appellant had \"snitched\" on him and other inmates.\nApp. 12. Although Appellant feared for his life as a result of\nthis incident, his request for protective custody was not\nhonored. App. 12.\n\nOn January 8, 1998 Appellant was transferred to a cell\nblock with no window \"for the express purpose's [sic] of\nhaving [him] in an area where the[racist guards] could\nharass, set up and try to kill [him]\". The very next day, one\nof the defendant guards, again in the pr esence of other\ninmates, accused Appellant of informing, and proceeded to\nspray him with an entire can of pepper gas, whereupon\nAppellant collapsed with an asthma attack, \"fighting for\nbreath on the floor\" and the guard\"left [him] on the floor to\ndie.\"\n\nAs far as the record reflects, none of the foregoing\nconditions had been corrected at the time Appellant filed\nhis Complaint.7\n\nIn sum, Appellant alleges that at the time of the\nComplaint (i) Appellant remained confined in an institution\ncontrolled by guards who believed he did not have any\nrights and who had a vendetta against him; (ii) the guards\nmade a practice of spraying inmates with pepper gas (to\nwhich Appellant was acutely vulnerable) on slight\nprovocation, and prison officials placed no r estraint on that\npractice; (iii) Appellant had been injured twice by pepper\ngas within just the past 10 weeks prior to filing; 8 (iv) the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Although many of the foregoing allegations may strike the reader as\nimprobable, they are as yet uncontr overted, and I believe that we are\nrequired to accept them as true for pr esent purposes. Cf. Gibbs, 116\nF.3d at 86 (holding that a district court should accept the allegations in\nthe Complaint in determining imminent danger for IFP purposes,\npending the appearance of a defendant who may contr overt the\nallegations).\n\n8. Cf. Ashley, 147 F.3d at 717 (concluding imminent danger exception\nmet in part because \"complaint was filed very shortly [within one month]\n\n                               26\n\fguards had incited hostility toward Appellant on the part of\nother prisoners by labeling Appellant as an infor mant;9 and\n(v) Appellant was housed in a cell block selected to facilitate\nattacks by guards and inmates. These unabated conditions\nclearly give rise to an ongoing imminent danger .\n\nHence, I believe the facts alleged in this case place\nAppellant squarely within a proper interpr etation of the\nexception to the three strikes rule. In Gibbs, as in Ashley\nand Choyce, there were similarly sufficient averments of\nongoing danger that remained \"imminent\" at the time of\nfiling.10 The majority today disposes of this case, overrules\nGibbs, and effectively disagrees with Ashley and Choyce,\nwithout carefully analyzing the sufficiency of the allegations\nof ongoing danger.11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nafter the last attack\"); Choyce, 160 F .3d at 1071 n. 4 (suggesting\nreconsideration in light of erroneous view that 17 months had passed\nsince last injury, where actually complaint wasfiled in 40 days).\n\n9. Cf. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 562 (1974) (\"Relationships\namong the inmates are . . . perhaps subject to the unwritten code that\nexhorts inmates not to inform on a fellow prisoner. . . . . The reality is\nthat disciplinary hearings . . . necessarily involve confrontations . . .\nbetween inmates who are being disciplined and those who would charge\nor furnish evidence against them. Retaliation is much more than a\ntheoretical possibility . . . .\").\n\n10. See Gibbs v. Roman, 116 F.3d 83 (3d Cir. 1997) (inmates' awareness\nof prisoner's status as informer subjected him to threats and attacks;\nGibbs claimed his \"life [was] in constant danger\" and conditions were\nunaddressed until litigation filed; prisoner was transferred during\npendency of appeal); see also supra n. 6 and accompanying text\n(discussing Ashley and Choyce).\n\n11. The majority neglects duly to consider the actual averments of\nAppellant's complaint, instead observing that \"at no point in the present\nlitigation did Appellant seek to rely on an ongoing danger theory\". Supra\nat 11 n.1. To the contrary, Appellant's counsel stated at oral argument\nthat \"if you look to the complaint itself, . . . he alleges a continuing\ncourse of conduct.\" Moreover, Appellant's counsel expressly \"embrace[d]\"\nthe argument that the time at which imminent danger is assessed is not\ncontrolling, because \"imminent really doesn't mean impending.\"\n\nIn any event, the majority opines as to the sufficiency of allegations of\nongoing harm, and in doing so applies too exacting a standard. Turning\n\n                               27\n\fThe result is that, henceforth in this Cir cuit, prisoners\nwith three strikes seeking IFP status will be faced with an\ninsurmountable obstacle: they must show that a serious\nphysical injury is \"about to\" befall them\"at any moment\",\nand apparently they may not predicate their showing on an\nongoing risk based on past events.12 What, then, will\nsuffice? Must a prisoner be running from his attackers as\nhe files? By limiting the imminent danger exception to the\n\"sword of Damocles\" situation, the majority all but writes\nthe exception out of the statute. Certainly, the drastically\nimpoverished version of the exception allowed by the\nmajority cannot well fulfill its putative office as \"a safety\nvalve . . . to prevent impending harms\". Supra at 1113\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbriefly to the complaint, the majority expr esses \"doubt whether [it]\nsuffice[s] to establish such an ongoing danger.\" Supra at 12 n.1. Of\ncourse, under our liberal pleading rules such a doubt should be resolved\nfor, rather than against, Appellant. Similarly, the majority's observation\nthat some of Appellant's allegations are \"generalized\" should not control\nour reading of the complaint. Even if those general allegations were not\nsupported with specific facts, as they are here, a pleading should be\ndeemed sufficient if it provides reasonable notice of the theories\npresented. See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957). This lenity in\npleading review is especially important as applied to an indigent,\nincarcerated, pro se litigant whose access to the courts is narrowly\ncircumscribed.\n\nThe majority concludes that Appellant's allegations fall short because\nthe several acts of which he complains are\"unconnected\", and do not\nform a \"pattern\". Supra at 12 n.1. A fair reading of the complaint\nindicates, however, that the events ar e connected by two alleged ongoing\nfactors: a long-established practice of arbitrary use of pepper gas\nagainst\nblack inmates, and a specific animus on the part of the guards against\nAppellant. Moreover, in suggesting that the mere passage of time\nbetween the incidents and after the last incident means that the danger\nwas no longer imminent at the time of filing, the majority disregards the\ncontinuing, unremedied nature of the factors that allegedly caused the\nincidents. Indeed, the occurrence of multiple incidents over a substantial\ntime period supports rather than under mines the conclusion that\nAppellant's danger was ongoing.\n12. Cf. O'Shea, supra.\n\n13. The majority's narrow reading of the exception will have a far-\nreaching effect, as persistent, ongoing imminent danger is a condition all\ntoo often encountered in our nation's prisons. Cf. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562\n(In many prisons, \"[g]uards and inmates co-exist in direct and intimate\ncontact. Tension between them is unremitting. Frustration, resentment\nand despair are commonplace.\").\n\n                               28\n\fA prisoner's resort to the courts may be expected to avert\nimpending danger not only by correcting unlawful\nconditions,14 but by deterring prison officials from unlawful\nconduct. Under the majority's interpretation, the potential\ndeterrence of civil rights damages would be lost with\nrespect to indigent prisoners with a history of prior failed\nsuits. That is, guards would be free to abuse or retaliate\nagainst such prisoners without fear of civil liability, so long\nas their conduct was not so perpetual as to trigger the\nmajority's test for imminent danger.\n\nThe majority's undermining of the protections afforded\ncivil rights under section 1983 is exacerbated by other\nfactors which, by delaying access to courts, incr ease the\nlikelihood that past abuses will effectively be immunized\nbecause a danger will no longer be \"imminent\" at the time\nof filing.15\n\nFinally, even in the rare case that satisfies the majority's\nnarrow definition of imminent danger at the time of filing,\na prisoner is effectively denied protection against trial error.\nUnder the majority's interpretation, a prisoner who has\nsecured a final judgment in the District Court finds himself\nin a peculiar position: he must once again meet the\n\"imminent danger\" requirement at that moment in time in\norder to file an appeal IFP. It is highly improbable that the\ndanger would still be \"about to\" occur at the time of an\nappeal, following entry of judgment.\n\nAlthough the majority opinion purports to cr eate\nunanimity among the courts of appeals, it does not and\ncannot achieve that purpose. As discussed above, today's\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n14. Such correction may occur through formal intervention of the courts\nor through voluntary redress in r esponse to a prisoner's invocation of\nthe\njudicial process. Cf. Medberry v. Butler , 185 F.3d 1189 (11th Cir. 1999)\n(prisoner subject to physical assaults transferr ed shortly after\ncomplaint\nwas filed).\n\n15. For example, prisoners who have been thr eatened or attacked are\noften subject to administrative solitary confinement or hospitalization,\nrespectively. Moreover, our recent decisions in Booth v. Churner, 206\nF.3d 289, 291 (3d Cir. 2000) and Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 67 (3d\nCir. 2000) require the exhaustion of internal prison remedies as a\nprerequisite for filing an action underS 1983 or Bivens.\n\n                                29\n\fholding cannot be reconciled with either the Eighth\nCircuit's decision in Ashley or the Fifth Circuit's decision in\nChoyce. Those cases evaluated the danger as of the filing\ndate, but both recognized that the imminent danger\nrequirement may be satisfied by an ongoing threat\nevidenced by past injuries attributable to uncorr ected\nconditions. See supra n. 6 and accompanying text.16 We\ncannot avoid a conflict by reciting similar standards, while\nreaching inconsistent results.\n\nI would hold that the exception applies, in accor d with\nGibbs, Ashley and Choyce; and I would leave for another\nday determination of the constitutional validity of section\n1915(g) in a case that clearly falls outside of its saving\nexception.17 However, since the majority has interpreted the\nexception narrowly and has found this case within the rule\nbarring IFP status, I will proceed to addr ess the statute's\nconstitutionality.\n\nIV.\n\nAs the majority acknowledges, \"[s]tatutes that\nsubstantially burden a fundamental right . . . must be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental\ninterest. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-17 (1982).\" Supra\nat 14.18 The right of access to the courts has long been\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. It should be noted that Choyce took a noticeably different approach\nfrom Banos v. O'Guin, 144 F.3d 883 (5th Cir. 1998), the earlier Fifth\nCircuit case relied upon by the majority.\n\n17. \"It is a well established rule that needless constitutional\nadjudication\nis to be avoided, and, toward that end, that when `a construction of the\nstatute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may be\navoided,' such construction should be given\" Roe v. Casey, 623 F.2d 829\n(3d Cir. 1980) (Hunter, J., concurring) (quoting Ashwander v. Tennessee\nValley Authority, 297 U.S. 288, 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)\n(additional citations omitted).\n\n18. The same level of scrutiny also applies to laws that impose burdens\nbased on a \"suspect\" classification. The majority reasons that neither\nprisoners nor indigents are suspect classes. It does not necessarily\nfollow\nthat the intersection of these classes -- the class of indigent prisoners\n--\nis not suspect. After all, possessing neither means nor liberty (and\nhaving incurred the disapprobation of society), indigent prisoners are a\n\n                               30\n\fdeemed fundamental. As long ago as 1215, this right was\narticulated in Chapter 29 of the Magna Carta.19 In the\nseminal case of Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137,\n163 (1803) the Supreme Court observed that\"[t]he very\nessence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of\nevery individual to claim the protection of the laws,\nwhenever he receives an injury.\" Mor e recently, the Court\nhas repeatedly recognized the fundamental importance of\nthe right of access to courts.20\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndiscrete, insular minority that is perhaps the group least able to protect\nits fundamental rights through majoritarian pr ocesses. Cf. United States\nv. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4 (1938) (\"whether\nprejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special\ncondition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those\npolitical\nprocesses ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which\nmay call for a correspondingly more sear ching judicial inquiry\")\n(citations\nomitted).\n\n19. Chapter 29 of the Magna Carta provided:\"To none will we sell, to\nnone will we deny or delay, right or justice.\" Magna Carta, c. 29 [c. 40\nof King John's Charter of 1215; c. 29 of King Edwar d's Charter of 1297]\n(1225), quoted in Burkett v.

Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 821 (1977).22\nThe Court in Bounds described this right of access as\n\"fundamental\", and held that it requir es that prisoners\nreceive \"a reasonably adequate opportunity to present\nclaimed violations of fundamental constitutional rights to\nthe courts.\" Bounds, 430 U.S. at 825, 828. Finally, in\nLewis, the Court indicated that inmates' right of court\naccess recognized in Bounds applies to actions \"to challenge\nthe conditions of their confinement\". Lewis , 518 U.S. at\n355.\n\nAs we have previously held, this right of court access\napplies even to litigious prisoners such as Appellant. See In\nre Oliver, 682 F.2d 443, 446 (3d Cir. 1982), quoted in\nWalton, 901 F.3d at 332 (\"Access to the courts is a\nfundamental tenet to our judicial system; legitimate claims\nshould receive a full and fair hearing no matter how\nlitigious the plaintiff may be.\").\n\nIn view of this long and virtually unbroken array of\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nprisoners to the Courts for the purpose of pr esenting their complaints\nmay not be denied or obstructed\", and observing that \"a State may not\nvalidly make the writ available only to prisoners who could pay a $4\nfiling fee.\"); Wolff,supra (applying holding and rationale ofAvery to\ncivil\nrights actions).\n\n21.

Lewis, 518 U.S. at 350 (describing the \"right of access to the\ncourts\" as \"already well-established\" when Bounds was decided).\n\n                               32\n\fauthority,23 it can scarcely be disputed that prisoners' right\nof access to the courts is a fundamental right. The majority\nis doubtless correct in pointing out that the right of access\nis \"not absolute\"; no rights are. What is important for equal\nprotection purposes is that the right of access is\nfundamental, at least when underlying fundamental rights\nare involved. See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 153\n(1992) (\"[T]he right to file a court action might be said to be\n[a prisoner's] remaining `most fundamental political right,\nbecause preservative of all rights.' \") (quoting Yick Wo v.\nHopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886)).24 Even if access to\ncourts were not itself a fundamental right, denial of access\nshould still be subject to strict scrutiny to the extent that\nit may impermissibly burden underlying fundamental rights\nat stake.25\n\nIndeed, the majority opinion acknowledges that \"[a]n\nunconditional right of access exists for civil cases. . . when\ndenial of a judicial forum would implicate a fundamental\nhuman interest\". Supra at 15. However, it declines to\naddress whether Appellant's claims involve fundamental\nrights.26\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n23. Only twice in our history has the Supr eme Court approved exaction\nof fees which had the effect of excluding an indigent would-be party from\ncourt. Both cases involved gratuitous government benefits, rather than\nunderlying constitutional rights. See United States v. Kras, 409 U.S. 434\n(1972) (bankruptcy); Ortwein v. Schwab, 410 U.S. 656 (1973) (welfare).\n\n24. See also Adams v.

The majority asserts that Appellant waived his argument that the\nright to be free from serious physical injury is as fundamental as the\n\f33\n\fNotwithstanding the majority's avoidance of the issue, it\nis manifest that the rights underlying Appellant's suit are\nfundamental. As I read the Complaint, at stake are the\nrights to be free from arbitrary infliction of serious physical\ninjury,27 and from racially discriminatory assault.28 That\nthese rights are fundamental to our constitutional system\ncannot be gainsaid.29\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nright to divorce (as to which a right of access to court was recognized in\nBoddie); but surely an assessment of the importance of the infringed\ninterest is implicitly part of every due pr ocess or equal protection\nchallenge. In any event, so long as we are addr essing the level of\nscrutiny to apply, we cannot avoid deciding whether a fundamental right\nis burdened.\n\nThe majority responds that \"the importance of the underlying right is\nlargely immaterial to the question whether that right is a fundamental\ninterest for Boddie purposes\", because \"an underlying constitutional\nentitlement rises to the level of a Boddie fundamental interest only when\nthe government blocks the sole legal means for safeguarding that\nentitlement . . . .\" Supra at 13 n.2. I believe this response conflates\nthe\nelements of fundamental right and burden: the importance of the right\nat stake is precisely what determines whether it is \"fundamental\"; while\nthe availability of other means to safeguard the right may help to\ndetermine the extent to which the right is bur dened, it has no bearing\non whether the burdened right is fundamental.\n\n27. This right is embodied in the Eighth Amendment prohibition against\ncruel and unusual punishments.\n\n28. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 556 (\"Prisoners are protected under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invidious\ndiscrimination based on race.\").\n\n29. Although the majority marshalls to its support cases from five other\ncircuits which have applied a rational basis r eview to section 1915(g),\nfour of these cases were explicitly premised on the absence of an\nunderlying fundamental interest. See Carson v. Johnson, 112 F.3d 818,\n821 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding prisoner had no fundamental interest in\nsubject of suit); Rivera v. Allin, 144 F .3d 719, 724 (11th Cir. 1998)\n(\"Rivera's well-pled allegations . . . plainly advance no cognizable\nfundamental interest.\"); Rodriguez v. Cook, 169 F.3d 1176, 1180 (9th\nCir. 1999) (agreeing with Carson and Rivera that \"where a fundamental\ninterest is not at stake, section 1915(g) does not infringe upon an\ninmate's meaningful access to the courts\"); White v. Colorado, 157 F.3d\n1226, 1233-34 (10th Cir. 1998) (recognizing right of action extends to\nsuits seeking to vindicate basic constitutional rights, but concluding\nthat\n\n                               34\n\fMoreover, other fundamental rights ar e sure to be\nimplicated in cases barred by the three strikes rule. For\nexample, a suit charging denial of a prisoner's religious\nfreedom in violation of the First Amendment is not likely to\ninvolve an element of imminent danger, and so will fall\noutside of the exception under section 1915(g). See, e.g.,\nLyon v. Krol, 940 F. Supp. 1433, 1437 (S.D. Iowa 1996),\nappeal dismissed, 127 F.3d 763 (8th Cir . 1997) (dismissing\nprisoner's free exercise of religion claim pursuant to three\nstrikes rule). Cf. O'Lone v. Estate of Shabazz , 482 U.S. 342,\n348 (1987) (recognizing prisoner's fundamental right to free\nexercise of religion).30\n\nIt seems clear that section 1915(g) substantially burdens\naffected prisoners' access to the courts and thereby\nburdens their enjoyment of whatever underlying rights they\nmay seek to enforce in court. The statute's ef fect, in\ncontravention of our law going back to the Magna Carta, is\neither to sell, to delay or to deny justice to the prisoners\nsubject to its strictures.31 If they cannot buy entry into\ncourt, they must wait until they can; and if the wait is too\nlong, justice will be denied to them.32\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nprisoner failed to state a claim for violation of the Eighth Amendment).\nThe fifth case, Wilson v. Yaklich , 148 F.3d 596 (6th Cir. 1998),\nacknowledged that the constitutional right of access to the courts \"is\nindeed `fundamental' \" and that a prisoner's access must be \"adequate,\neffective and meaningful\", but found that the right was not infringed\nsolely because the prisoner still had recourse to state court. Id. at 605\n(citations omitted).\n\n30. See also Stacey H. O'Bryan, Note, Closing the Courthouse Door: The\nImpact of the Prison Litigation Reform Act's Physical Injury Requirement\non the Constitutional Rights of Prisoners, 83 V a. L. Rev. 1189, 1202-10\n(1997) (mentioning the right to be free fr om racial segregation, the\nright\nto privacy, and the right to be free fr om non-physical violations of the\nEighth Amendment as among those left unprotected as to prisoners\nbarred from litigation by section 1915(g)).\n\n31. Cf. n.19, supra (discussing Magna Carta's prohibition against sale,\ndelay or denial of justice).\n\n32. According to the majority, Congress \"[r]ecogniz[ed] that it could take\nprisoners a significant period of time to obtain the filing fee in some\ncases\". Supra at 11.\n\n                               35\n\fIn response to the apparent burden on fundamental\nrights, the majority makes two arguments: First, the\nmajority argues that section 1915(g) does not prevent\naffected prisoners from filing their actions, but only from\nenjoying IFP status. The same argument was pr eviously\nmade by the Eleventh Circuit. See Rivera v. Allin, 144 F.3d\n719, 723 (11th Cir. 1998). This argument reflects a\nsurprising disregard for the practicalfinancial constraints\nfaced by indigent prisoners, and appears to ignor e the\nreality, recognized by the Supreme Court, that even a small\nprepayment obligation can pose an insur mountable hurdle.\nSee Boddie, 401 U.S. at 380 (acknowledging that a facially\nvalid fee may \"offend due process because it operates to\nforeclose a particular party's opportunity to be heard.\");\nGreen, 669 F.2d at 786 (describing a prepayment\nrequirement as a \"potentially pr ohibitive financial barrier\"\nto court access on the part of the affected indigent\nprisoner). The majority does not, however, r eally miss this\npoint: in the very same paragraph in which it ar gues that\nsection 1915(g) does not block access to the federal courts,\nit concludes that precluding suit in federal court as a\npractical matter is precisely what Congr ess intended. See\nsupra at 10-11.33\n\nBecause it ultimately recognizes the practical reality that\naccess to the federal courts will be delayed or denied for\nsome, the majority repairs to its second ar gument: that\nforeclosing the federal forum imposes no r eal burden, as\nprisoners may bring the same civil rights claims in state\ncourts, \"where limitations on filing I.F .P. may not be as\nstrict.\" Supra at 10 (emphasis added); see also supra at 15.\nIn the end, the majority's rejection of strict scrutiny is\nexpressly predicated on the presumed availability of a state\nlaw forum.34 See supra at 16 (\"Because neither Delaware\nsubstantive law nor Delaware court rules pr evented\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n33. See also Banos, 144 F.3d at 885 n. 1 (\"It is possible that a potential\nlitigant who is denied IFP status under this pr ovision will not have the\nability to pay the entire filing fee within the statute of limitations or,\nin\nthe case of an appeal, within the time for filing an appeal, and will\nthereby be precluded from litigating or appealing his case on the\nmerits.\").\n34. As the majority correctly observes, the Court's ruling in Boddie\nturned on the State's monopoly over divor ce actions and the resultant\nabsence of any \"recognized, effective alternatives\" for resolution.\nBoddie,\n401 U.S. at 375-76. The case does not, however , stand for the\nproposition that availability of a state forum justifies selective denial\nof\n\faccess to a federal forum for the vindication of federal civil rights\nclaims.\n\n                               36\n\f[Appellant] . . . from pursuing his claims, we do not agree\nthat strict scrutiny is the appropriate test.\") (emphasis\nadded).35 See also Wilson v. Yaklich, 148 F.3d 596, 605 (6th\nCir. 1998) (concluding that prisoner's fundamental right of\naccess to the courts was not infringed upon because he\n\"still had available . . . the opportunity to litigate his federal\nconstitutional causes of action in forma pauperis in state\ncourt.\"). But cf. Rivera, 144 F.3d at 724 n.9 (declining to\nplace reliance on availability of state forum).\n\nEven assuming that a state forum is available, however,\nit is by no means clear that denial of a federal forum does\nnot in itself impose a substantial burden on the right of\naccess. See, e.g., Lyon, 940 F .Supp. at 1437-38 (\"Although\ninmates can also bring S 1983 claims in state court,\nplaintiffs have an important interest in access to federal\ncourts for vindication of their federal constitutional\nrights.\"); see also Procup, 792 F .2d at 1070 (\"An absolute\nbar against a prisoner filing any suit in federal court would\nbe patently unconstitutional.\"); Green , 669 F.2d at 786\n(concluding that \"constitutional right of access to the\ncourts\" was \"unduly impair[ed]\" by or der that effectively\ndenied \"any and all access to the district court\"); Packer\nAvenue Assocs., 884 F.2d at 748 (holding that order\nprohibiting subsequent filings in federal court could \"not be\nallowed to stand\").36\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n35. If, as appears to be the case, the statute's constitutionality as\napplied\nto suits based on fundamental rights hinges on the availability of an\nadequate state forum, we should make this limitation explicit in order to\nguide the District Courts.\n\n36. The argument that federal courts may turn a deaf ear to those who\nhave access to state courts \"disregar ds the historic importance of access\nto federal courts to pursue civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. S 1983.\"\nLukens, The Prison Litigation Reform Act , 70 Temp. L. Rev. at 512. Cf.\nMonroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 174 (1961) (one purpose of S 1983 \"was\nto provide a federal remedy where the state remedy, though adequate in\ntheory, was not available in practice\"); McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 153\n(\"federal courts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims\nof prison inmates\") (citations omitted).\n\nIt is important to note that the Supreme Court has expressly rejected\nthe converse argument that the availability of a federal remedy justified\na filing fee that effectively barred indigent prisoners from state court.\nSee\n\n                               37\n\fAlthough the alternative forum argument may have\nsuperficial appeal, I do not believe it can withstand\nsearching examination. In the first place, the argument\nneglects to consider foreclosure of the courts to the \"three-\nstrikes\" prisoner in states which have adopted parallel\nlegislation.37 This is not mer ely an academic concern. The\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania appeared as an amicus\ncuriae in this case and explained that the \"many thousands\nof prisoners\" housed in Pennsylvania's thirty-nine\ncorrectional facilities \"annually file hundreds of federal civil\nactions directed against state officials and employees\", and\nimplied that a substantial number of those actions would\nbe affected by the decision announced her ein. Because\nPennsylvania has adopted a three strikes limitation of IFP\nstatus that parallels section 1915(g), ther e is no judicial\nforum available to indigent Pennsylvania prisoners with\nthree strikes unless they can satisfy the majority's virtually\npreclusive test for imminent danger, no matter how\nmeritorious their claims and no matter how fundamental\nthe rights at stake.38\n\nIn the second place, the alternative forum ar gument also\nneglects the potential implications of removal to federal\ncourt. Federal-law civil rights actions filed in state court\ngenerally may be removed by the defendants, with the likely\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSmith v. Bennett, 365 U.S. 708 (1961). T o paraphrase the Court's\nadmonition, \"it would ill-behoove this gr eat [nation], whose devotion to\nthe equality of rights is indelibly stamped upon its history, to say to\nits\nindigent prisoners seeking to redress what they believe to be [violations\nof federal law]: `go to the [state] court.' \" Id. at 713.\n\n37. See, e.g., 41 Pa. C.S.A. S 6602(f) (West Supp. 1999); La. Rev. Stat.\nAnn. S 1187 (West Supp. 1999). See also Laurie Smith Camp, Why\nNebraska Needs Prison Litigation Reform, 76 Neb. L. Rev. 781, 781\n(1997) (proposing parallel state legislation in Nebraska); Three Strikes,\n71\nU. Colo. L. Rev. at 209-210 (predicting that\"[o]ther states are likely to\nrespond similarly to the influx of claims br ought by [prisoners] who are\notherwise precluded from bringing suit in forma pauperis\").\n\n38. In its amicus brief, Pennsylvania ar gues that a state forum is\navailable, but inexplicably neglects to notify us that the purported\nalternative is generally unavailable to Pennsylvania prisoners with claims\nconcerning prison conditions.\n\n                               38\n\feffect that an indigent plaintiff subject to the three strikes\nrule would lose his ability to appeal.39 The prospective loss\nof such an important procedural safeguar d is a very\nsubstantial burden on affected litigants. 40\n\nBecause section 1915(g) does impose a substantial\nburden on the fundamental rights of many if not all\nmembers of the class against whom it is directed, the next\nstep is to examine whether it is narrowly tailored to serve\na compelling governmental interest.\n\nAs identified by the majority, the congressional purpose\nbehind section 1915(g) was to deter frivolous lawsuits\nthrough \"economic incentives that would pr ompt prisoners\nto `stop and think' before filing a complaint.\" Supra at 17.\nSee also supra at 10 (\"The `three strikes' rule . . . supplied\na powerful economic incentive not to file frivolous lawsuits\nor appeals.\").41 It is not at all apparent how \"disqualifying\nfrequent filers who have failed in the past to carefully\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n39. See The Prison Litigation Reform Act, 70 Temp. L. Rev. at 513-517\n(observing that if defendant removes the case to federal court as\npermitted under 28 U.S.C. S 1441, plaintiff may lose his right to appeal\nthe federal claims if he is within the provisions of section 1915(g) and\ncannot afford prepayment in full; he may also be unable to appeal\npendent state claims over which the district court exercised\njurisdiction).\n\n40. See Griffin, 351 U.S. at 18 (\"It is true that a State is not required\nby\nthe Federal Constitution to provide appellate courts or a right to\nappellate review at all. But that is not to say that a State that does\ngrant\nappellate review can do so in a way that discriminates against some\nconvicted defendants on account of their poverty.\"); See also Three\nStrikes, 71 U. Colo. L. Rev. at 209 (noting that\"[a]lthough the right to\nan appeal is not constitutionally guaranteed, equal protection concerns\nnevertheless arise when this right is effectively denied to only one class\nof litigant\") (citing Douglas v. Califor nia, 372 U.S. 353, 357-58\n(1963)).\n\n41. Cf. Frank I. Michelman, The Supr eme Court and Litigation Access\nFees: The Right to Protect One's Rights - Part II, 1974 Duke L.J. 527, 559\n(observing that a fixed fee's deterrent ef fect on frivolous filings will\nvary\ninversely with the individual's finances, with the truly indigent being\n\"totally `deterred' \"). Michelman concludes that \" `Deterrence' in any\nacceptable sense of that term, can be depended upon to operate only on\nthat group of citizens to whom [the fee] will seem neither a prohibitive\nsum, nor, on the other hand, a trifling amount to pay for the privilege of\ndemanding one's rights.\" Id.\n\f39\n\fevaluate their claims\" can serve as a \"deterr ent\nmechanism\". Supra at 17 (emphasis added). No matter how\nlong a disqualified prisoner such as Appellant stops, no\nmatter how carefully he thinks, and no matter how\nmeritorious his claims, he will remain disqualified. It is\nsimply not possible to deter frivolous filings that have\nalready occurred. At a minimum, ther efore, the\nretrospective application of the thr ee strikes rule to past\nfilings cannot further the statute's asserted deterrent\npurpose.42\n\nWith respect to future filings, it is difficult to see how the\nthree strikes rule functions solely as an economic deterrent.\nTo be sure, another section of the PLRA is well calculated\nto have that effect. See 28 U.S.C.S 1915(b) (requiring\nprisoners with IFP suits to pay filing fee in installments, in\nlieu of prior practice of waiving fee). This section corrects\nthe perceived problem of inmates filing suits with no\nfinancial consequences, while at the same time ensuring\nthat the truly indigent prisoner will not be denied access to\nthe courts solely because he lacks the requisite funds.43\nThe disincentive supplied by the three strikes rule, on the\nother hand, is not purely economic. For the truly indigent,\nthe rule threatens a loss of the fundamental right of access\nto the courts. This is in no sense a market-corr ecting\neconomic deterrent.44\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n42. In the present case, according to the District Court, only one of\nAppellant's disqualifying dismissals occurred after the effective date of\nthe PLRA. App. 20.\n43. See 28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(4) (Supp. III 1997) (providing that \"[i]n no\nevent shall a prisoner be prohibited fr om bringing a civil action or\nappealing a civil or criminal judgment for the r eason that the prisoner\nhas no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing\nfee.\"). This saving provision is inapplicable to prisoners subject to\nsection\n1915(g).\n\n44. The majority's discussion does not say how the three strikes rule is\nsupposed to further deterrence. Instead, it seems to say that the three\nstrikes rule is rationally related to its goal because it is within\ncongressional power. See supra at 18 (\"Preventing frequent filers from\nobtaining fee waivers is rationally related to the legitimate government\ninterest of deterring frivolous lawsuits because `Congress is no more\ncompelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it is to provide\nunlimited access to them.' \"). This is patently a non sequitur.\n\n                               40\n\fIn any event, even assuming that the goal of deterring\nfrivolous suits is a compelling governmental interest, and\nthat the three strikes rule somehow furthers that goal, the\nstatute nevertheless cannot withstand strict scrutiny\nbecause at best there is only a very poor fit between end\nand means. As a mechanism for deterring frivolous claims,\nsection 1915(g) is both under- and over -inclusive. On the\none hand, it leaves unchecked the flow of frivolous lawsuits\nfiled by indigent non-prisoners and by prisoners and non-\nprisoners with sufficient funds.45 On the other hand, it cuts\noff non-frivolous claims filed by indigent prisoners within\nits scope. See supra at 10 (\"In stark ter ms, . . . the I.F.P.\nprivilege will not be available . . . no matter how\nmeritorious subsequent claims may be.\").46 These\nshortcomings precisely echo those of the pr epayment\nrequirements disapproved in Green and its progeny.47 Cf.\nRinaldi v. Yeager, 384 U.S. 305, 310 (1966) (state statute\nrequiring reimbursement of cost of criminal appeal\ntranscript only as to prisoners held unconstitutional:\n\"Assuming a law enacted to [deter frivolous appeals] to be\notherwise valid, the present statutory classification is no\nless vulnerable under the Equal Protection Clause when\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n45. See, e.g., Mary Tushnet and Larry Y ackle, Symbolic Statutes and Real\nLaws: The Pathologies of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\nand the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 47 Duke L. J. 1 (Oct. 1997)\n(\"[N]otably, the statute allows any prisoner who can pay the complete\nfiling fee in advance to file as many frivolous or malicious lawsuits as\nshe wants.\").\n\n46. Compare Watson, 901 F.2d 329, 331 (finding denial of constitutional\nright where blanket bar to IFP filings failed to \"consider[ ] the effects\non\na legitimate claim\").\n\n47. Illustrating the \"general inappropriateness of withdrawing the in\nforma pauperis privilege as a means to curtail. . . abuse\", the Green\ncourt observed:\n\n        On the one hand, Green is totally free toflood the courts with\npaper\n        provided that he pays the going rate: or ders erecting financial\n        barriers are only as effective as the litigant is truly\nimpoverished. On\n        the other hand, these restrictions are clumsily overinclusive: if\n        Green does not have the money to file a frivolous claim, he also\ndoes\n        not have the money to file a legitimate one.\n\n669 F.2d 779.\n\f41\n\fviewed in relation to that function. By imposing a financial\nobligation only upon inmates of institutions, the statute\ninevitably burdens many whose appeals, though\nunsuccessful, were not frivolous, and leaves untouched\nmany whose appeals may have been frivolous indeed.\")\nMoreover, much better targeted means are available to\narrest chronic frivolous filings.48\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that courts which have\napplied strict scrutiny have found section 1915(g) wanting.\nSee Lyon, 940 F. Supp. 1433 (S 1983 action alleging denial\nof participation in Jewish services and other r eligious\npractices);49 Ayers v. Norris , 43 F.Supp.2d 1039 (E.D. Ark.\n1999). See also Wilson, 148 F.3d at 604 (upholding section\n1915(g) under a rational basis test, but noting the court\n\"might not believe [S 1915(g)] to be . . . even a prudent[ ]\nresponse to the problem presented\").50\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n48. The injunction that apparently r emains in effect against Appellant,\nsetting special filing preconditions in r esponse to his history of abuse,\nis\nbut one example. See supra at 4. Another example is the PLRA's own\nprovision for judicial screening. Under section 1915A, a court may review\nand assess the merit of a prisoner's claims befor e docketing. See 28\nU.S.C. S 1915A(a)-(b) (Supp. III 1997). These measures, directed at\nparticular abusers and particular frivolous claims, are clearly more\nnarrowly tailored to serve their pr oper end than the three strikes\nclassification, which lumps good faith err or with abuse and stifles\nmeritorious claims along with frivolous ones. See Lukens, The Prisoner\nLitigation Reform Act, 70 Temp. L. Rev. at 505-06 (observing that\n\"Section 1915(g) . . . treats the prisoner who has filed otherwise\nmeritorious claims, but failed to name the pr oper party, . . . in the\nsame\nmanner as the litigant who sued the President .. . for stealing the\nmultiplication tables from him.\")\n\n49. The District Court in Lyon noted that, unlike the traditional\ndiscretionary power of the courts to limit abusive litigation by an\nindividual prisoner based on his particular cir cumstances, the \"three\ndismissal rule\" gave no consideration to, e.g., length of incarceration,\nnumber of meritorious actions, or \"other pertinent information that\nmight guide a federal court in properly limiting abuse . . . .\" Lyon, 940\nF. Supp. at 1438. Applying a strict scrutiny review, the District Court\nheld section 1915(g) violative of equal pr otection. The Eighth Circuit\nundertook no constitutional review, finding instead that the plaintiff\nlacked standing because he had sufficient funds.\n\n50. The majority's response that constitutional constraints require\n\"neither a perfect nor even best availablefit\" between statutory ends and\n\n                               42\n\fBecause section 1915(g) is not narrowly tailor ed to serve\na compelling governmental purpose, its substantial\ninfringement of indigent prisoners' fundamental right of\naccess to the courts, and of the constitutional rights at\nstake in the potential litigation thwarted ther eby, amounts\nto an unconstitutional deprivation of the equal pr otection of\nthe laws and of the due process of law guaranteed by the\nFifth Amendment.51 Cf. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 633\n(1996) (\"A law declaring that in general it shall be more\ndifficult for one group of citizens than for all others to seek\naid from the government is itself a denial of equal\nprotection of the laws in the most literal sense.\").52\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nmeans, supra at 18, quoting United States v. Mariani, 212 F.3d 761, 774\n(3d Cir. 2000) (en banc), is not entir ely apt. Section 1915(g) is not\nconstitutionally deficient because it is mer ely imperfect or sub-optimal;\nrather, its very high degree of both under- and over-inclusiveness\nrenders it an extremely poor fit. Cases such as Mariani, which permit a\ncertain degree of under-inclusiveness in statutes that burden First\nAmendment rights, therefore do not advance the inquiry. In the context\nof an equal protection challenge to a bur den on access to the courts, the\nSupreme Court has found the same type of under - and over-\ninclusiveness at issue here to be constitutionally impermissible. See\nRinaldi, supra at 41-42.\n\n51. This conclusion is in accord with an apparent consensus among\ncommentators who have addressed the constitutionality of the PLRA's\nthree strikes provision. See, e.g., Lukens, The Prison Litigation Reform\nAct, supra n. 36; Franklin, Three Strikes, supra n. 25; David C.Leven,\nJustice for the Forgotten and Despised, 16 Touro L. Rev. 1, 15 (Fall\n1999); Mary Tushnet and Larry Yackle, Symbolic Statutes and Real Laws:\nThe Pathologies of the Antiterrorism and Ef fective Death Penalty Act and\nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 47 Duke L.

In addition to its infirmity on equal protection grounds, section\n1915(g) raises troubling questions concer ning the constitutional\nprohibition against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws, in that it\noperates as an extra-judicial punishment against an identified group\nbased on their past conduct. As noted by the majority, the three strikes\n\n                               43\n\fA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nrule seeks to deter prisoner litigation by \"disqualifying frequent filers\nwho have failed in the past to carefully evaluate their claims prior to\nfiling.\" Supra at 17. Cf. Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States, 520 U.S.\n939, 947 (1997) (stating that a statute which \"attaches a new disability,\nin respect to transactions . . . already past, must be deemed\nretrospective\") (quoting Soc. for Propagation of the Gospel v. Wheeler, 22\nF. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (C.C.N.H. 1814) (Story, J.)).\n\nThe Supreme Court has identified three r equirements for finding that\na challenged statute is a bill of attainder: \"specification of the\naffected\npersons, punishment, and lack of a judicial trial.\" Selective Service\nSystem v. Minnesota Public Interest Resear ch Group, 468 U.S. 841, 847\n(1984). As to the first element, section 1915(g) plainly is directed\ntoward\n\"specifically designated persons or groups\". Id., quoting United States v.\nBrown, 381 U.S. 437, 447 (1965). The af fected prisoners are identified by\nan objectively ascertainable, immutable characteristic -- three or more\nprior \"strikes\" -- and are commonly r eferred to in cases and\ncongressional debate by a common pejorative title (\"frequent filers\"). As\nto the second element, the majority appears to acknowledge a punitive\npurpose and effect: \"Potentially negative consequences in federal courts\n. . . are precisely the consequences intended by Congress. The outcome\npredicted by Appellant [i.e., that a prisoner \"could forever lose his\nability\nto bring his suit as a practical matter\"] is . .. exactly what Congress\nintended.\" Supra at 10-11. Cf. Green, 669 F.2d at 786 (characterizing as\n\"simply punitive\" a prepayment requirement which \"is not geared to\ndiscerning whether each claim presents a new nonfrivolous issue\" and\nwhichs seeks to \"deter\" by \"assum[ing]\" that the affected prisoner \"will\nnot be able to meet the required filing fee\"). Finally, as to the third\nelement, section 1915(g) imposes its deprivation without any judicial\ntrial. Cf. Lyon, 940 F. Supp. at 1438 (contrasting blanket bar of section\n1915(g) with particularized discretion attendant on judicial proceeding to\nlimit abusive litigation).\n\n                               44\n\f",

On May 17, 1999, Appellant\nreported to a community confinement center , and on May\n27, 1999, he was released from the custody of the\nDepartment of Corrections.\n\nAppellant has filed at least 180 civil rights or habeas\ncorpus claims.

We stated that\nAbdul-Akbar's \"history of repetitious and frivolous filings\nindicates a clear intent to abuse the courts and the I.F.P.\nprocess.\" Id. at 334. An injunction subsequently was\nentered by the district court. Abdul-Akbar v. Dept. of\nCorrections, 910 F.

The pr oposed Complaint alleged\nthat on or about January 9, 1998, prison officials\narbitrarily sprayed Appellant with pepper gas and r efused\nto provide him with medical treatment even though they\nknew that he suffers from asthma. Appellant also claimed\nthat certain prison officials violated his civil rights by\nbelonging to a racist organization, that one defendant failed\nto investigate properly the pepper spray incident, and that\nthe district court judge violated his Sixth Amendment right\n\n                               4\n\fof access to the courts by preventing his complaints from\nbeing heard.\n\nThe district court denied the motion to proceed I.F.P.,\nreasoning that (1) Appellant had brought actions that the\ncourt had dismissed as frivolous on more than three prior\noccasions, and (2) he did not claim to be in imminent\ndanger of serious physical injury.\n\nThe district court had jurisdiction over this case under\n28 U.S.C. S 1331. We have jurisdiction because an order\ndenying leave to proceed I.F.P. is a final, collateral order\nappealable under 28 U.S.C. S 1291. The appeal was timely\nfiled.

See Act of July 20, 1892,\nch. 209 1-5, 27 Stat. 252. Congress enacted the I.F.P.\nstatute, currently codified at 28 U.S.C.S 1915, \"to ensure\nthat administrative court costs and filing fees, both of\nwhich must be paid by everyone else who files a lawsuit,\nwould not prevent indigent persons from pursuing\nmeaningful litigation.\" Deutsch v.

Congress was also awar e of the\npotential for abuse, and it included a subsection allowing\nfor dismissal of frivolous or malicious actions. Denton, 504\nU.S. at 31.\n\nCongress subsequently enacted the Prison Litigation\nReform Act (\"PLRA\" or \"Act\"), Pub. L. No. 104-134, 110\nStat. 1321 (1996), largely in response to concerns about the\nheavy volume of frivolous prisoner litigation in the federal\ncourts. See 141 Cong. Rec. S14408-01, S14413 (daily ed.\nSept. 27, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (explaining that the\nnumber of prisoner suits filed \"has grown astronomically--\nfrom 6,600 in 1975 to more than 39,000 in 1994\"). In\n\n                               5\n\fenacting the PLRA, Congress concluded that the large\nnumber of meritless prisoner claims was caused by the fact\nthat prisoners easily obtained I.F.P. status and hence were\nnot subject to the same economic disincentives tofiling\nmeritless cases that face other civil litigants. See 141 Cong.\nRec. S7498-01, S7526 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement\nof Sen. Kyl) (\"Filing frivolous civil rights lawsuits has\nbecome a recreational activity for long-term residents of\nprisons.\"); 141 Cong. Rec. S7498-01, S7524 (daily ed. May\n25, 1995) (statement of Sen. Dole) (\"[P]risoners will now\n`litigate at the drop of a hat,' simply because they have little\nto lose and everything to gain.\"). To curb this trend, the\nPLRA instituted a number of reforms in the handling of\nprisoner litigation.\n\nAmong other things, the PLRA amended the I.F .P. statute\nas it applies to prisoners. Under the statute as amended, a\nprisoner who is allowed to proceed I.F.P . is not excused\nfrom paying filing fees, but is only excused from pre-paying\nthem in full if they meet certain criteria. The PLRA now\nrequires prisoners who qualify for I.F .P. status to pay by\nway of an initial partial fee, followed by installment\npayments until the entire fee is paid. 28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(1).\nCongress also added S 1915(g), the \"three strikes rule,\"\nwhich limits a prisoner's ability to proceed I.F.P. if the\nprisoner abuses the judicial system by filing frivolous\nactions. Prisoners may avoid the limitation in this\nprovision, however, if they are under \"imminent danger of\nserious physical injury.\"\n\nThis appeal requires us to decide when the existence of\n\"imminent danger\" is to be assessed; specifically, whether it\nis assessed as of the time the complaint is filed, or at some\ntime in the past, even though that danger no longer exists\nwhen the complaint is filed.\n\nToday we abandon the rule announced in Gibbs that\n\"imminent danger\" is assessed at the time of the alleged\nincident. We adopt, instead, the construction set forth by\nthe Fifth, Eighth and Eleventh Circuit Courts of Appeals,\nthat a prisoner may invoke the \"imminent danger\"\nexception only to seek relief from a danger which is\n\"imminent\" at the time the complaint is filed. We conclude\nthat this interpretation is consistent with the plain\n\n                                6\n\flanguage of S 1915(g), with congressional intent and with\nthe legislative purpose of the PLRA as a whole.\n\nIII.\n\nThis is a case of statutory construction, and we begin our\nanalysis with the language of S 1915(g):\n\n        In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or\n        appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under\n        this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or mor e prior\n        occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any\n        facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the\n        United States that was dismissed on the grounds that\n        it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon\n        which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is\n        under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\n\nA.\n\nWe now apply settled precepts of statutory construction\nand take as our beginning point a recognition that from the\nearliest times, we have adopted what is called the American\nPlain Meaning Rule exemplified in Caminetti v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98854\"><a href=\"/opinion/98854/caminetti-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1917) (internal citations\nomitted):\n\n        It is elementary that the meaning of the statute must,\n        in the first instance, be sought in the language in\n        which the act is framed, and if that is plain, and if the\n        law is within the constitutional authority of the law-\n        making body which passed it, the sole function of the\n        courts is to enforce it according to its terms. Where the\n        language is plain and admits of no more than one\n        meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise and\n        the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no\n        discussion.\n\nIn 1993, the Court made a modern statement of the plain\nmeaning rule: \"Our task is to give effect to the will of\nCongress, and where its will has been expr essed in\nreasonably plain terms, that language must ordinarily be\nregarded as conclusive.\" Negonsett v.

The plain meaning is conclusive, therefore,\n\"except in the `rare cases [in which] the literal application\nof a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with\nthe intentions of its drafters.' \" Id. at 242 (quoting Griffin v.\nOceanic Contractors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110787\"><a href=\"/opinion/110787/griffin-v-oceanic-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982)).\n\nB.\n\nWe now apply the ordinary meaning of the words chosen\nby Congress in drafting S 1915(g). The phrase \"in no event\"\nsimply means \"may not.\" This court has pr eviously held\nthat the word \"bring\" in this context plainly refers to the\ntime when the civil action is initiated. Gibbs v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759134\"><a href=\"/opinion/759134/henry-gibbs-jr-v-dr-william-c-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 (3d Cir. 1998). Putting the phrases together,\nthe first clause of S 1915(g) obviously means \"a prisoner\nmay not file a new civil complaint.\" In the or dinary sense of\nthe words, this clause refers temporally to the time the new\ncomplaint is filed. The clause \"unless he is in imminent\ndanger of serious physical injury\" is an exception to the\npreclusive effect of the statute. But the exception is cast in\nthe present tense, not in the past tense, and the word \"is\"\nin the exception refers back to the same point in time as\nthe first clause, i.e., the time of filing. The statute\ncontemplates that the \"imminent danger\" will exist\ncontemporaneously with the bringing of the action.\nSomeone whose danger has passed cannot reasonably be\ndescribed as someone who \"is\" in danger , nor can that past\ndanger reasonably be described as \"imminent.\" The court\nso held in Ashley v. Dilworth, 147 F .3d 715, 717 (8th Cir.\n1998):\n\n        As the statute's use of the present tense verbs`bring'\n        and `is' demonstrates, an otherwise ineligible prisoner\n        is only eligible to proceed IFP if he is in imminent\n        danger at the time of filing. Allegations that the\n        prisoner has faced imminent danger in the past ar e\n        insufficient to trigger this exception to S 1915(g) and\n        authorize the prisoner to pay the filing fee on the\n        installment plan.\n\nSee also Medberry v. Butler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73968\"><a href=\"/opinion/73968/medberry-v-butler/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1193 (11th Cir.\n1999) (\"Congress' use of the present tense in S 1915(g)\n\n                               8\n\fconfirms that a prisoner's allegation that he faced imminent\ndanger sometime in the past is an insufficient basis to\nallow him to proceed in forma pauperis . . . .\"); Banos v.\nO'Guin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">883</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 885 (5th Cir . 1998) (\"[T]he language\nof S 1915(g), by using the present tense, clearly refers to the\ntime when the action or appeal is filed or the motion for IFP\nstatus is made.\"). Taking both clauses together, the statute\nplainly means that a prisoner is not permitted to file his\ncomplaint unless he is, at that time, under imminent\ndanger. Viewed from the Plain Meaning Rule, we interpret\n\"is under imminent danger\" to relate to the time when \"a\nprisoner bring[s] a civil action.\"\n\nIV.\n\nReinforcing the interpretation of the statute by\napplication of the Plain Meaning Rule is an analysis of\nlanguage found in other portions of the PLRA. For example,\nanother section of the Act, S 1915(b)(4), pr ovides:\n\n        In no event shall a prisoner be prohibited from bringing\n        a civil action or appealing a civil or criminal judgment\n        for the reason that the prisoner has no assets and no\n        means by which to pay the initial partial filing fee.\n\n28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(4) (emphasis added). As in subsection\n(g), this provision begins with the exhortation\"in no event\nshall,\" and, as in subsection (g), it describes a necessary\ncondition by using the present tense of the operative verb.\nSection 1915(b)(4) plainly means that the courts may not\nprohibit a prisoner from filing a new complaint for the\nreason that he does not possess any assets at the time of\nfiling. The temporal reference point for the verb \"has\" is the\ntime of filing, the time at which the fee is due.\n\nOther provisions support this construction by focusing\non the time of filing. Section 1997e(a) of T itle 42, amended\nby the PLRA, requires that the plaintif f exhaust\nadministrative remedies, but only if the plaintiff is a\nprisoner at the time of filing. Greig v. Goord, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762120\"><a href=\"/opinion/762120/james-c-greig-v-g-goord-commissioner-of-new-york-state-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n167 (2d Cir. 1999). Similarly, the applicability of the\npersonal injury requirement of 42 U.S.C.S 1997e(e) turns\non the plaintiff 's status as a prisoner , not at the time of the\nincident, but when the lawsuit is filed. Harris v. Garner,\n\n                                9\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769210\"><a href=\"/opinion/769210/frederick-lamar-harris-danny-chadwick-v-wayne-garner-commissioner-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974-975 (11th Cir. 2000). Finally, the need\nfor the district court to screen a complaint in a civil action\nfiled by a prisoner, as requir ed by 28 U.S.C. S 1915A, looks\nto the plaintiff 's status when the case isfiled. Johnson v.\nHill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2139038\"><a href=\"/opinion/2139038/johnson-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1488 n.2 (E.D. V a. 1997).\n\nV.\n\nAppellant argues that requiring pr oof of imminent danger\nas of the time of filing is inconsistent with Congress' intent.\nHaving applied the American Plain Meaning Rule and\nhaving determined that there is no ambiguity, we are not\nrequired to answer this contention of the Appellant.\nNevertheless, we perceive the congressional intent as clear\nwhen we examine the purpose of the entire PLRA.\n\nAs noted above, Congress enacted the PLRA in or der to\nlimit the filing of frivolous and vexatious prisoner lawsuits.\nTo accomplish this, Congress curtailed the ability of\nprisoners to take advantage of the privilege offiling I.F.P.\nThe \"three strikes\" rule added by the PLRA supplied a\npowerful economic incentive not to file frivolous lawsuits or\nappeals. In stark terms, it declared that the I.F.P. privilege\nwill not be available to prisoners who have, on thr ee\noccasions, abused the system by filing frivolous or\nmalicious lawsuits or appeals, no matter how meritorious\nsubsequent claims may be.\n\nIt is important to note that S 1915(g) does not block a\nprisoner's access to the federal courts. It only denies the\nprisoner the privilege of filing before he has acquired the\nnecessary filing fee. Appellant argues that a prisoner\nsubject to the \"three strikes\" rule, but who does not\nestablish \"imminent danger,\" could for ever lose his ability\nto bring his suit as a practical matter because of the\ndifficulties of obtaining the money, the application of the\nstatute of limitations, or the possible loss of necessary\nevidence. This argument attempts to pr ove too much. It\noverlooks the fact that prisoners may seek r elief in state\ncourt, where limitations on filing I.F .P. may not be as strict.\nPotentially negative consequences in federal courts, as\ndistinguished from state courts, ar e precisely the\nconsequences intended by Congress. The outcome predicted\n\n                               10\n\fby Appellant is, for better or for worse, exactly the result\nthe PLRA intends.\n\nRecognizing that it could take prisoners a significant\nperiod of time to obtain the filing fee in some cases,\nCongress created a limited exception aimed at preventing\nfuture harms, and did so through the use of the word\n\"imminent.\" \"Imminent\" dangers ar e those dangers which\nare about to occur at any moment or are impending. See\nWEBSTER'S II NEW RIVERSIDE UNIVERSITYDICTIONARY 611 (1984).\nBy using the term \"imminent,\" Congr ess indicated that it\nwanted to include a safety valve for the \"thr ee strikes\" rule\nto prevent impending harms, not those har ms that had\nalready occurred. The imminent danger exception allows\nthe district court to permit an otherwise barr ed prisoner to\nfile a complaint I.F.P. if the prisoner could be subject to\nserious physical injury and does not then have the r equisite\nfiling fee.\n\nIn contrast, under the Gibbs construction, the prisoner\nneed only show that he was subject to imminent danger at\nthe time of the alleged incident. By definition, an imminent\nthreat of serious physical injury always exists in the\nmoments before any such injury is inflicted. Thus, under\nthe Gibbs approach, any time that an otherwise disqualified\nprisoner alleges that any threat of physical injury occurred\nat any time, that prisoner automatically qualifies for the\nimminent danger exception. The Gibbs interpr etation of the\nimminent danger exception thereby swallows the rule. Like\nevery other court of appeals that has consider ed this issue,\nwe refuse to conclude that with one hand Congr ess\nintended to enact a statutory rule that would r educe the\nhuge volume of prisoner litigation, but, with the other\nhand, it engrafted an open-ended exception that would\neviscerate the rule.1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The dissent devotes much effort to asserting that, even under our time\nof filing construction, Appellant's S 1983 Complaint satisfied the terms\nof\nthe imminent danger exception because the Complaint, under the\ndissent's liberal construction, alleged an ongoing risk of serious\nphysical\ninjury. Importantly, at no point in the present litigation did Appellant\nseek to rely on an ongoing danger theory, even through the able counsel\nappointed by this court for purposes of this appeal. Inasmuch as the\n\n                               11\n\fThis is not to suggest that we would criticize any statute\nor judicially-created legal precept that would permit any\nprisoner, even a frequent filer, to file such a complaint I.F.P.\nSuch a notion is entirely compatible with the precept that\nfor any injury, there should be a remedy. But we do not\nwrite in the abstract here, nor do we write on a clean slate.\nCongress has deliberately decided to legislate on this\nsubject by proclaiming, as public policy, a determination to\nreduce prisoner litigation in the federal courts. As citizens,\nwe may disagree with the congressional wisdom, but as\njudges, knowing the clearly stated legislative purpose, we\nmay not disembowel the legislative act. Federal courts,\nunlike state common law King's Bench courts, do not have\nunlimited power and authority. We are limited to that which\nhas been granted by Congress. What Congr ess gives it may\nalso take away. The ability to proceed I.F .P. is not a\nconstitutional right. Congress granted the right to proceed\nI.F.P. in 1892, and it has the power to limit this statutorily\ncreated right. Here it has taken away our ability as judges\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndissent uses our silence with respect to an issue not raised by the\nparties to argue that our construction of the imminent danger exception\neliminates a prisoner's ability to satisfy the imminent danger exception\nby alleging an ongoing risk of serious physical injury, we respond only\nby stressing that we by no means intend such a result.\n\nAt all events, we doubt whether the allegations in Appellant's S 1983\nComplaint suffice to establish such an ongoing danger. Even under a\nliberal reading of Appellant's pleading, it is evident that Appellant's\nallegations center on an incident that occurr ed on or about January 9,\n1998, when a prison official allegedly sprayed Appellant with pepper gas.\nApp. 9-10. Appellant does not identify any further incidents occurring\nafter that date. Moreover, although Appellant alleges that he experienced\nseveral other acts of physical harassment by dif ferent prison officials,\nthese events not only all pre-date the January 9th incident, but also\nappear entirely unconnected to it, and thus undermine the dissent's\nclaim that the danger to Appellant was ongoing. Finally, while Appellant\ndoes allege that he complained for a year about the use of pepper gas\n(App. 10), and that prison officials engaged in\"continuing harassment,\nploits [sic] to hurt or kill [him], and other forms of retaliation,\" (App.\n8,\n9) such generalized allegations strike us as insufficient to connect the\nseparate incidents mentioned above into a patter n of threats of serious\nphysical injury that are ongoing.\n\n                               12\n\fto grant I.F.P. status to a \"thr ee strikes\" prisoner, no matter\nhow meritorious his or her subsequent claims may be,\nunless the prisoner \"is under imminent danger of serious\nphysical injury\" when he or she \"bring[s] a civil action.\"\nCongress has held trump here, and it has dealt a hand. As\njudges we must play it.\n\nVI.\n\nAppellant also mounts the argument that S 1915(g), as we\ninterpret it, would offend the equal pr otection guarantee\nimplied in the Fifth Amendment by improperly burdening a\nprisoner's \"fundamental right of access\" to the courts.2\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. In his reply brief, Appellant contends for the first time that this\ninterpretation of the statute runs counter to the protections assured by\nthe Eighth Amendment.

The dissent agrees with Abdul-Akbar that the right\nto be free from serious physical injury is just as weighty as the right to\na divorce at issue in Boddie, and would hold that such a right represents\na fundamental interest for Boddie purposes. Furthermore, the dissent\nalso points to several other underlying rights, including the First\nAmendment right to free exercise of r eligion, that are not at issue in\nthe\ninstant case, but that the dissent would also pr esumably treat as\nfundamental interests under Boddie. What the dissent fails to recognize,\n\f13\n\fMoreover, he argues that we must apply strict scrutiny in\nconsidering this contention and that, alternatively, even\nunder rational basis scrutiny, the statute, as we interpret\nit, does not pass constitutional muster because it is not\nrationally related to a legitimate gover nmental interest.\n\nA.\n\nAlthough the Fifth Amendment contains no Equal\nProtection Clause, \"the Fifth Amendment's Due Process\nClause prohibits the Federal Government from engaging in\ndiscrimination that is `so unjustifiable as to be violative of\ndue process.' \" Schlesinger v.

Accordingly, the Court has construed the Fifth\nAmendment to contain an equal protection guarantee. See,\ne.g., Edmonson v.

Conversely, if a statute neither bur dens a\nfundamental right nor targets a suspect class, it does not\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection\nClause, as incorporated through the Fifth Amendment's\nDue Process Clause, so long as it bears a rational\nrelationship to some legitimate end.

As we discuss infra in Part VI.B., an underlying\nconstitutional entitlement rises to the level of a Boddie fundamental\ninterest only when the government blocks the sole legal means for\nsafeguarding that entitlement, and not simply because the interest itself\nis a weighty one.\n\n                               14\n\fThis requires us first to determine whether Appellant is\na member of a suspect class or whether a fundamental\nright is implicated. Neither prisoners nor indigents are\nsuspect classes. See, e.g., Pryor v.

Nor has\nAppellant argued before us that indigent prisoners,\nspecifically, frequent filer indigent prisoners, are a suspect\nclass. We then must inquire whether the\"time of filing\"\nconstruction infringes upon one of Appellant's fundamental\nrights.\n\nB.\n\nAppellant contends that the \"time of filing\" interpretation\nadopted by our sister courts of appeals and adopted by us\ntoday unconstitutionally burdens his fundamental right of\naccess to the courts by requiring him to pay fees.

Courts pr esented with\nthis issue have consistently held that merely r equiring a\nprisoner to pay filing fees in a civil case does not, standing\nalone, violate that prisoner's right of meaningful access to\nthe courts. See, e.g., Rivera v.

We agree. Section 1915(g) does not prevent a\nprisoner with \"three strikes\" fromfiling a civil action; he or\nshe is simply unable to enjoy the benefits of pr oceeding\nI.F.P. and must pay the fees at the time of filing instead of\nunder the installment plan. And, given the right of\nCongress to limit the power of federal courts, it cannot be\nsaid that limiting the temporal aspect of the exception to\nthe \"three strikes\" rule infringes upon Appellant's right of\naccess to the courts.\n\nThe Court has recognized only a \"narr ow category of civil\ncases in which the State must provide access to its judicial\nprocesses without regard to a party's ability to pay court\nfees.\" M.L.B. v.

Appellant focuses on the\n\n                               16\n\fright of access to the courts, arguing thatS 1915(g)'s\npurpose and effect is to prevent him and other frequent filer\nprisoner indigents from filing civil lawsuits. In addressing\nthis contention, we must first examine the legislative\npurpose.\n\nAs discussed above, the legislation was aimed at the\nskyrocketing numbers of claims filed by prisoners -- many\nof which are emotionally driven but legally deficient -- and\nthe corresponding burden those filings have placed on the\nfederal courts. Congress sought to put in place economic\nincentives that would prompt prisoners to \"stop and think\"\nbefore filing a complaint.3 The \"three strikes\" rule thus\nserves as a rational deterrent mechanism, for cing potential\nprisoner litigants to examine whether their filings have any\nmerit before they are filed, and disqualifying frequent filers\nwho have failed in the past to carefully evaluate their\nclaims prior to filing.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Congress's rationale for placing the fee requirements on prisoners is\ncaptured in the statements of Senator Jon Kyl:\n\n           Section 2 will require prisoners to pay a very small share of the\n           large burden they place on the Federal judicial system by paying a\n           small filing fee upon commencement of lawsuits. In doing so, the\n           provision will deter frivolous inmate lawsuits. The modest\nmonetary\n           outlay will force prisoners to think twice about the case and not\njust\n           file reflexively. Prisoners will have to make the same decision\nthat\n           law-abiding Americans must make: Is the lawsuit worth the price?\n           Criminals should not be given a special privilege that other\n           Americans do not have . . . . The volume of prisoner litigation\n           represents a large burden on the judicial system, which is already\n           overburdened by increases in nonprisoner litigation. Yet prisoners\n           have very little incentive not to file nonmeritorious lawsuits.\nUnlike\n        other prospective litigants who seek poor person status, prisoners\n        have all the necessities of life supplied, including the materials\n        required to bring their lawsuits. For a prisoner who qualifies for\n        poor person status, there is no cost to bring a suit and,\ntherefore,\n        no incentive to limit suits to cases that have some chance of\n        success. The filing fee is small enough not to deter a prisoner\nwith\n        a meritorious claim, yet large enough to deter frivolous claims\nand\n        multiple filings.\n\n141 CONG. REC. S7498-01, S7526 (daily ed. May 25, 1995) (statement of\n\fSen. Kyl) (citation omitted).\n\n                                17\n\fDeterring frivolous prisoner filings in the federal courts\nfalls within the realm of Congress' legitimate interests, and\nthe interpretation we adopt today is rationally related to the\nachievement of that interest. \"[T]he right of access to federal\ncourts is not a free floating right, but rather is subject to\nCongress' Article III power to set limits on federal\nlegislation.\" Roller, 107 F.3d at 231. Although it had the\npower to do so, Congress did not repeal any particular\ncause-of-action available to prisoners. Rather , Congress\nchanged only the rules regarding I.F .P. status. Under\nS 1915(g), prisoners are still able tofile civil actions; they\nare merely prohibited from enjoying I.F.P. status.

Although the dissent claims that the \"thr ee strikes\"\nrule embodied in S 1915(g) is too blunt an instrument and\nis insufficiently targeted to arrest frivolous filings, we have\nalways recognized that constitutional constraints \"require[ ]\nneither a perfect nor even best availablefit\" between a\nstatute's goal and the means employed in that statute to\nfurther that goal.

Thus,S 1915(g)\nrationally balances the economic deterrence rationale\nbehind the \"three strikes\" rule with the need for those\nprisoners who remain in danger of futur e grievous harm to\nbe able to file immediately.

Lukens, The Prison Litigation Reform Act: Three\nStrikes and You're Out of Court -- It May Be Effective, But Is It\n\n                               20\n\fThis case unfortunately illustrates the maxim that bad\ncases may sometimes make bad law. This Appellant has\nclearly abused the IFP system, filing some 200 cases, most\nwithout merit. The three strikes rule as interpreted by the\nmajority, however, will burden other would-be litigants who\nhave not filed 200 cases, and whose \"strikes\" were racked\nup without any bad faith or abuse.3 It will, moreover, bar\npotentially meritorious litigation at the filing stage, with no\nopportunity for substantive review or appeal.\n\nII.\n\nThe principal holding announced by the majority is not\nvery far-reaching. It rejects a statement in our earlier Gibbs\ncase to the effect that imminent danger is to be determined\nas of the time of the incident complained of, and joins with\nour sister courts of appeals that have held that danger\nmust exist at the time the Complaint or appeal isfiled. I\njoined in, and continue to adhere to, the able opinion of\nJudge Garth in Gibbs. In Gibbs we held that a prisoner who\nalleged two prior attacks by inmates and death thr eats,\neach related to his identification as a gover nment\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nConstitutional?, 70 Temp. L. Rev. 471, n. 90-91 (Summer 1997)\n(providing extensive citations to circuit court cases requiring that\ninjunctions be narrowly tailored to pr eserve access for legitimate\nclaims).\nThe sole difference between the pr eclusive effect of injunctions held\nimpermissible in the cited cases and the statutory bar of section 1915(g)\nis that the latter includes a narrow exception (extremely narrow, as\ninterpreted by the majority) which is patently insufficient to safeguard\nthe broad scope of rights jeopardized by the IFP ban. Cf. Procup, 792\nF.2d at 1074 (Clark, J., concurring) (construing limitation of IFP for\nabusive prisoner litigant to \"claims alleging actual or threatened\nphysical\nharm\" to be \"an unconstitutional denial of access\").\n\n3. Although dismissals for failure to state a claim do not necessarily\nsignify abuse, they nonetheless count as \"strikes\" for purposes of\nsection 1915(g). Moreover, the many procedural and substantive hurdles\nerected in the path of civil rights claims against government actors might\neasily trip up a pro se litigant with a bona fide claim. The majority's\nrepeated characterization of the statutory bar as applying only to\nprisoners who \"abuse\" the judicial system byfiling frivolous actions is\ntherefore somewhat misleading.\n\n                               21\n\finformant, and who alleged that his \"life[was] in constant\ndanger\", provided sufficient allegations of \"imminent\ndanger\" to survive the \"three strikes\" rule. Although our\nprincipal holding was that \"a complaint alleging imminent\ndanger . . . must be credited as having satisfied the\nthreshold criterion of S 1915(g) unless[that] element is\nchallenged\", we also stated that \"the pr oper focus when\nexamining an inmate's complaint filed pursuant to\nS 1915(g) must be the imminent danger faced by the inmate\nat the time of the alleged incident, and not at the time the\ncomplaint was filed.\" 116 F.3d at 86.\n\nNo clear intent may be discerned from section 1915(g)'s\nuse of the present tense (\"unless the prisoner is under\nimminent danger\"), because the same subsection elsewhere\nemploys the present tense in refer ence to what are\nexpressly recognized as past events (\"if the prisoner has\nbrought an action or appeal . . . that was dismissed on the\ngrounds that it is frivolous, malicious or fails to state a\nclaim . . .\"). This erroneous combination of tenses renders\nthe statutory provision ambiguous, and I believe that such\nambiguity must be resolved in favor of pr eserving the right\nof access to the courts for prisoners threatened with bodily\ninjury.\n\nAs the majority has acknowledged, the purpose of the\nexception is to \"prevent[ ] futur e harms.\" Supra at 11. This\npurpose is best served by a liberal interpretation of the\nexception, one which gives scope to -- and so facilitates --\nthe deterrent effect of the subsequent damages remedy\navailable under section 1983. See City of Riverside v.\nRivera, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111730\"><a href=\"/opinion/111730/riverside-v-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (1986) (plurality) (stating that\n\"the damages a plaintiff recovers contribute significantly to\nthe deterrence of civil rights violations in the future\"). Cf.\nGibbs (rejecting argument that \"suit for damages rather\nthan injunctive relief . . . was not seeking to protect . . .\nphysical safety\"). 116 F.3d at 85. Contrary to the majority's\nassertion, the exception as interpreted by Gibbs does not\n\"eviscerate\" the three strikes rule. A would-be litigant must\nplead imminent danger of serious physical injury (rather\nthan a deprivation of procedural, associational, religious or\nother rights), and the court must determine that such\ndanger is or was in fact present if such allegation is\n\n                               22\n\fcontroverted. Moreover, as discussed below, section\n1915(g)'s potential encroachment into important\n 665<!>constitutional rights also counsels for a br oad\n\ninterpretation of the exception. Finally, the importance of\npresenting an appropriately lenient interpretation in this en\nbanc opinion -- which will guide the district courts in their\ndecisions on hundreds, if not thousands, of prisoner filings\n-- is heightened by the preclusive natur e of section 1915(g).\nThat is, the denial of in forma pauperis status and resultant\ndismissal of prisoner litigation made pursuant ther eto will\nbe effectively unreviewable, as a truly indigent plaintiff will\nno more be able to afford the r equisite filing costs for\nappeal of that dismissal than for the underlying action.\n\nIII.\n\nWhile I disagree with the majority's rejection of the\nstandard enunciated in Gibbs for one which determines the\nexistence of imminent danger at the time the Complaint or\nappeal is filed, it is the majority's application of that\nstandard to the facts of this case, and implicitly to those of\nGibbs, that I find considerably more tr oubling.\n\nThe majority appears simply to assume that its holding\nthat imminent danger must be assessed at the time offiling\nis dispositive of this case, and that Appellant was not in\nsuch danger. In so assuming, the majority seriously\nundermines protection of physically endangered prisoners\nby paying too little heed to ongoing threats.\n\nThe majority's lengthy explication of statutory tense\nnotwithstanding, an equally crucial question of\ninterpretation under section 1915(g) concer ns the meaning\nof \"imminent danger\". The majority's definition of\n\"imminent\" dangers as those \"which ar e about to occur at\nany moment or impending\", supra at 11, is far too\nrestrictive. In a real-world prison setting, the timing of an\nattack cannot be so neatly predicted. It may be that an\nongoing threat of danger looms over a prisoner for an\nextended period. At any given moment, the har m might not\nbe \"about to\" occur; then again, it might. Such is the\nnature of \"danger\". It involves risk, not certainty.\n\n                                23\n\fThe phrase \"imminent danger\" is not defined in the\nPLRA. It may be instructive, however, to consider the\ndefinition accorded the same phrase in other contexts. For\nexample, under the Eighth Amendment prison authorities\nmust protect prisoners not only from curr ent threats, but\nalso from \"sufficiently imminent dangers\"; the courts have\ndefined that phrase as encompassing those dangers\"likely\nto cause harm in the `next week, month, or year.' \" Horton\nv.

Reading the Complaint in\nthe light most favorable to Appellant, I find his claimed\npredicament alarming.\n\nAppellant, a black inmate, brought this action seeking,\ninter alia, an injunction against white prison guar ds \"from\ncontinuing . . . plots to hurt or kill [him]\". App. 8. The\nguards in question are asserted to be racists who \"don't\naccept . . . Black people as human beings\" and thus do not\nrespect rights of any black person. App. 13. Appellant is a\nparticular target of the guards' animus, as he asserts they\nare engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against Appellant\nfor filing complaints against them for past abuses.

App. 10-11.\n\nIn September or October of 1997, in a \"deliberate attempt\nto have [Appellant] hurt or killed\", a guar d told an inmate\nthat Appellant had \"snitched\" on him and other inmates.\nApp. 12. Although Appellant feared for his life as a result of\nthis incident, his request for protective custody was not\nhonored. App. 12.\n\nOn January 8, 1998 Appellant was transferred to a cell\nblock with no window \"for the express purpose's [sic] of\nhaving [him] in an area where the[racist guards] could\nharass, set up and try to kill [him]\". The very next day, one\nof the defendant guards, again in the pr esence of other\ninmates, accused Appellant of informing, and proceeded to\nspray him with an entire can of pepper gas, whereupon\nAppellant collapsed with an asthma attack, \"fighting for\nbreath on the floor\" and the guard\"left [him] on the floor to\ndie.\"\n\nAs far as the record reflects, none of the foregoing\nconditions had been corrected at the time Appellant filed\nhis Complaint.7\n\nIn sum, Appellant alleges that at the time of the\nComplaint (i) Appellant remained confined in an institution\ncontrolled by guards who believed he did not have any\nrights and who had a vendetta against him; (ii) the guards\nmade a practice of spraying inmates with pepper gas (to\nwhich Appellant was acutely vulnerable) on slight\nprovocation, and prison officials placed no r estraint on that\npractice; (iii) Appellant had been injured twice by pepper\ngas within just the past 10 weeks prior to filing; 8 (iv) the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. Although many of the foregoing allegations may strike the reader as\nimprobable, they are as yet uncontr overted, and I believe that we are\nrequired to accept them as true for pr esent purposes. Cf. Gibbs, 116\nF.3d at 86 (holding that a district court should accept the allegations in\nthe Complaint in determining imminent danger for IFP purposes,\npending the appearance of a defendant who may contr overt the\nallegations).\n\n8. Cf. Ashley, 147 F.3d at 717 (concluding imminent danger exception\nmet in part because \"complaint was filed very shortly [within one month]\n\n                               26\n\fguards had incited hostility toward Appellant on the part of\nother prisoners by labeling Appellant as an infor mant;9 and\n(v) Appellant was housed in a cell block selected to facilitate\nattacks by guards and inmates. These unabated conditions\nclearly give rise to an ongoing imminent danger .\n\nHence, I believe the facts alleged in this case place\nAppellant squarely within a proper interpr etation of the\nexception to the three strikes rule. In Gibbs, as in Ashley\nand Choyce, there were similarly sufficient averments of\nongoing danger that remained \"imminent\" at the time of\nfiling.10 The majority today disposes of this case, overrules\nGibbs, and effectively disagrees with Ashley and Choyce,\nwithout carefully analyzing the sufficiency of the allegations\nof ongoing danger.11\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nafter the last attack\"); Choyce, 160 F .3d at 1071 n. 4 (suggesting\nreconsideration in light of erroneous view that 17 months had passed\nsince last injury, where actually complaint wasfiled in 40 days).\n\n9.

The majority neglects duly to consider the actual averments of\nAppellant's complaint, instead observing that \"at no point in the present\nlitigation did Appellant seek to rely on an ongoing danger theory\". Supra\nat 11 n.1. To the contrary, Appellant's counsel stated at oral argument\nthat \"if you look to the complaint itself, . . . he alleges a continuing\ncourse of conduct.\" Moreover, Appellant's counsel expressly \"embrace[d]\"\nthe argument that the time at which imminent danger is assessed is not\ncontrolling, because \"imminent really doesn't mean impending.\"\n\nIn any event, the majority opines as to the sufficiency of allegations of\nongoing harm, and in doing so applies too exacting a standard. Turning\n\n                               27\n\fThe result is that, henceforth in this Cir cuit, prisoners\nwith three strikes seeking IFP status will be faced with an\ninsurmountable obstacle: they must show that a serious\nphysical injury is \"about to\" befall them\"at any moment\",\nand apparently they may not predicate their showing on an\nongoing risk based on past events.12 What, then, will\nsuffice? Must a prisoner be running from his attackers as\nhe files? By limiting the imminent danger exception to the\n\"sword of Damocles\" situation, the majority all but writes\nthe exception out of the statute. Certainly, the drastically\nimpoverished version of the exception allowed by the\nmajority cannot well fulfill its putative office as \"a safety\nvalve . . . to prevent impending harms\". Supra at 1113\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nbriefly to the complaint, the majority expr esses \"doubt whether [it]\nsuffice[s] to establish such an ongoing danger.\" Supra at 12 n.1. Of\ncourse, under our liberal pleading rules such a doubt should be resolved\nfor, rather than against, Appellant. Similarly, the majority's observation\nthat some of Appellant's allegations are \"generalized\" should not control\nour reading of the complaint. Even if those general allegations were not\nsupported with specific facts, as they are here, a pleading should be\ndeemed sufficient if it provides reasonable notice of the theories\npresented. See Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1957). This lenity in\npleading review is especially important as applied to an indigent,\nincarcerated, pro se litigant whose access to the courts is narrowly\ncircumscribed.\n\nThe majority concludes that Appellant's allegations fall short because\nthe several acts of which he complains are\"unconnected\", and do not\nform a \"pattern\". Supra at 12 n.1. A fair reading of the complaint\nindicates, however, that the events ar e connected by two alleged ongoing\nfactors: a long-established practice of arbitrary use of pepper gas\nagainst\nblack inmates, and a specific animus on the part of the guards against\nAppellant. Moreover, in suggesting that the mere passage of time\nbetween the incidents and after the last incident means that the danger\nwas no longer imminent at the time of filing, the majority disregards the\ncontinuing, unremedied nature of the factors that allegedly caused the\nincidents. Indeed, the occurrence of multiple incidents over a substantial\ntime period supports rather than under mines the conclusion that\nAppellant's danger was ongoing.\n12. Cf. O'Shea, supra.\n\n13. The majority's narrow reading of the exception will have a far-\nreaching effect, as persistent, ongoing imminent danger is a condition all\ntoo often encountered in our nation's prisons. Cf. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 562\n(In many prisons, \"[g]uards and inmates co-exist in direct and intimate\ncontact. Tension between them is unremitting.

Under the majority's interpretation, the potential\ndeterrence of civil rights damages would be lost with\nrespect to indigent prisoners with a history of prior failed\nsuits. That is, guards would be free to abuse or retaliate\nagainst such prisoners without fear of civil liability, so long\nas their conduct was not so perpetual as to trigger the\nmajority's test for imminent danger.\n\nThe majority's undermining of the protections afforded\ncivil rights under section 1983 is exacerbated by other\nfactors which, by delaying access to courts, incr ease the\nlikelihood that past abuses will effectively be immunized\nbecause a danger will no longer be \"imminent\" at the time\nof filing.15\n\nFinally, even in the rare case that satisfies the majority's\nnarrow definition of imminent danger at the time of filing,\na prisoner is effectively denied protection against trial error.\nUnder the majority's interpretation, a prisoner who has\nsecured a final judgment in the District Court finds himself\nin a peculiar position: he must once again meet the\n\"imminent danger\" requirement at that moment in time in\norder to file an appeal IFP. It is highly improbable that the\ndanger would still be \"about to\" occur at the time of an\nappeal, following entry of judgment.\n\nAlthough the majority opinion purports to cr eate\nunanimity among the courts of appeals, it does not and\ncannot achieve that purpose.

The majority does not, however, r eally miss this\npoint: in the very same paragraph in which it ar gues that\nsection 1915(g) does not block access to the federal courts,\nit concludes that precluding suit in federal court as a\npractical matter is precisely what Congr ess intended. See\nsupra at 10-11.33\n\nBecause it ultimately recognizes the practical reality that\naccess to the federal courts will be delayed or denied for\nsome, the majority repairs to its second ar gument: that\nforeclosing the federal forum imposes no r eal burden, as\nprisoners may bring the same civil rights claims in state\ncourts, \"where limitations on filing I.F .P. may not be as\nstrict.\" Supra at 10 (emphasis added); see also supra at 15.\nIn the end, the majority's rejection of strict scrutiny is\nexpressly predicated on the presumed availability of a state\nlaw forum.34 See supra at 16 (\"Because neither Delaware\nsubstantive law nor Delaware court rules pr evented\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n33. See also Banos, 144 F.3d at 885 n. 1 (\"It is possible that a potential\nlitigant who is denied IFP status under this pr ovision will not have the\nability to pay the entire filing fee within the statute of limitations or,\nin\nthe case of an appeal, within the time for filing an appeal, and will\nthereby be precluded from litigating or appealing his case on the\nmerits.\").\n34.

The case does not, however , stand for the\nproposition that availability of a state forum justifies selective denial\nof\n\faccess to a federal forum for the vindication of federal civil rights\nclaims.\n\n                               36\n\f[Appellant] . . . from pursuing his claims, we do not agree\nthat strict scrutiny is the appropriate test.\") (emphasis\nadded).35 See also Wilson v.

But cf. Rivera, 144 F.3d at 724 n.9 (declining to\nplace reliance on availability of state forum).\n\nEven assuming that a state forum is available, however,\nit is by no means clear that denial of a federal forum does\nnot in itself impose a substantial burden on the right of\naccess.

If, as appears to be the case, the statute's constitutionality as\napplied\nto suits based on fundamental rights hinges on the availability of an\nadequate state forum, we should make this limitation explicit in order to\nguide the District Courts.\n\n36.

The\nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania appeared as an amicus\ncuriae in this case and explained that the \"many thousands\nof prisoners\" housed in Pennsylvania's thirty-nine\ncorrectional facilities \"annually file hundreds of federal civil\nactions directed against state officials and employees\", and\nimplied that a substantial number of those actions would\nbe affected by the decision announced her ein. Because\nPennsylvania has adopted a three strikes limitation of IFP\nstatus that parallels section 1915(g), ther e is no judicial\nforum available to indigent Pennsylvania prisoners with\nthree strikes unless they can satisfy the majority's virtually\npreclusive test for imminent danger, no matter how\nmeritorious their claims and no matter how fundamental\nthe rights at stake.38\n\nIn the second place, the alternative forum ar gument also\nneglects the potential implications of removal to federal\ncourt.

Cf. Frank I. Michelman, The Supr eme Court and Litigation Access\nFees: The Right to Protect One's Rights - Part II, 1974 Duke L.J. 527, 559\n(observing that a fixed fee's deterrent ef fect on frivolous filings will\nvary\ninversely with the individual's finances, with the truly indigent being\n\"totally `deterred' \"). Michelman concludes that \" `Deterrence' in any\nacceptable sense of that term, can be depended upon to operate only on\nthat group of citizens to whom [the fee] will seem neither a prohibitive\nsum, nor, on the other hand, a trifling amount to pay for the privilege of\ndemanding one's rights.\" Id.\n\f39\n\fevaluate their claims\" can serve as a \"deterr ent\nmechanism\". Supra at 17 (emphasis added). No matter how\nlong a disqualified prisoner such as Appellant stops, no\nmatter how carefully he thinks, and no matter how\nmeritorious his claims, he will remain disqualified. It is\nsimply not possible to deter frivolous filings that have\nalready occurred. At a minimum, ther efore, the\nretrospective application of the thr ee strikes rule to past\nfilings cannot further the statute's asserted deterrent\npurpose.42\n\nWith respect to future filings, it is difficult to see how the\nthree strikes rule functions solely as an economic deterrent.\nTo be sure, another section of the PLRA is well calculated\nto have that effect. See 28 U.S.C.S 1915(b) (requiring\nprisoners with IFP suits to pay filing fee in installments, in\nlieu of prior practice of waiving fee). This section corrects\nthe perceived problem of inmates filing suits with no\nfinancial consequences, while at the same time ensuring\nthat the truly indigent prisoner will not be denied access to\nthe courts solely because he lacks the requisite funds.43\nThe disincentive supplied by the three strikes rule, on the\nother hand, is not purely economic. For the truly indigent,\nthe rule threatens a loss of the fundamental right of access\nto the courts. This is in no sense a market-corr ecting\neconomic deterrent.44\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n42. In the present case, according to the District Court, only one of\nAppellant's disqualifying dismissals occurred after the effective date of\nthe PLRA. App. 20.\n43. See 28 U.S.C. S 1915(b)(4) (Supp. III 1997) (providing that \"[i]n no\nevent shall a prisoner be prohibited fr om bringing a civil action or\nappealing a civil or criminal judgment for the r eason that the prisoner\nhas no assets and no means by which to pay the initial partial filing\nfee.\"). This saving provision is inapplicable to prisoners subject to\nsection\n1915(g).\n\n44. The majority's discussion does not say how the three strikes rule is\nsupposed to further deterrence. Instead, it seems to say that the three\nstrikes rule is rationally related to its goal because it is within\ncongressional power. See supra at 18 (\"Preventing frequent filers from\nobtaining fee waivers is rationally related to the legitimate government\ninterest of deterring frivolous lawsuits because `Congress is no more\ncompelled to guarantee free access to federal courts than it is to provide\nunlimited access to them.' \"). This is patently a non sequitur.\n\n                               40\n\fIn any event, even assuming that the goal of deterring\nfrivolous suits is a compelling governmental interest, and\nthat the three strikes rule somehow furthers that goal, the\nstatute nevertheless cannot withstand strict scrutiny\nbecause at best there is only a very poor fit between end\nand means. As a mechanism for deterring frivolous claims,\nsection 1915(g) is both under- and over -inclusive. On the\none hand, it leaves unchecked the flow of frivolous lawsuits\nfiled by indigent non-prisoners and by prisoners and non-\nprisoners with sufficient funds.45 On the other hand, it cuts\noff non-frivolous claims filed by indigent prisoners within\nits scope. See supra at 10 (\"In stark ter ms, . . . the I.F.P.\nprivilege will not be available . . . no matter how\nmeritorious subsequent claims may be.\").46 These\nshortcomings precisely echo those of the pr epayment\nrequirements disapproved in Green and its progeny.47 Cf.\nRinaldi v.

The injunction that apparently r emains in effect against Appellant,\nsetting special filing preconditions in r esponse to his history of abuse,\nis\nbut one example. See supra at 4. Another example is the PLRA's own\nprovision for judicial screening. Under section 1915A, a court may review\nand assess the merit of a prisoner's claims befor e docketing. See 28\nU.S.C. S 1915A(a)-(b) (Supp. III 1997). These measures, directed at\nparticular abusers and particular frivolous claims, are clearly more\nnarrowly tailored to serve their pr oper end than the three strikes\nclassification, which lumps good faith err or with abuse and stifles\nmeritorious claims along with frivolous ones. See Lukens, The Prisoner\nLitigation Reform Act, 70 Temp. L. Rev. at 505-06 (observing that\n\"Section 1915(g) . . . treats the prisoner who has filed otherwise\nmeritorious claims, but failed to name the pr oper party, . . . in the\nsame\nmanner as the litigant who sued the President .. . for stealing the\nmultiplication tables from him.\")\n\n49. The District Court in Lyon noted that, unlike the traditional\ndiscretionary power of the courts to limit abusive litigation by an\nindividual prisoner based on his particular cir cumstances, the \"three\ndismissal rule\" gave no consideration to, e.g., length of incarceration,\nnumber of meritorious actions, or \"other pertinent information that\nmight guide a federal court in properly limiting abuse . . . .\" Lyon, 940\nF.
