We reverse and remand.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       In August 2002, Henry Rollie and twenty-two other prisoners filed a 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983 complaint seeking damages and injunctive relief against eighteen named\ndefendants, mostly prison officials. As relevant, plaintiffs alleged that while they\nwere being held in the segregation unit, fourteen defendants1 permitted “disciplinary\ndouble celling” of maximum security prisoners with other prisoners: no distinction\nwas made among those in temporary administrative segregation, disciplinary\nsegregation, and administrative segregation (AS). This double-celling subjected\nprisoners to assaults, rapes, and fights, all of which went undetected due to the use\nof “solid and soundproof boxcar doors.” The fourteen defendants at issue, “through\nfunctionaries,” knew double-celling in the segregation unit caused fights, assaults,\nand rapes, and they falsified temporary AS confinement forms to cover up the\n\n      1\n       Gary Kempker, George A. Lombardi, Tom Clements, Michael Kemna, Jean\nAnn Johnson, Clarence Denzer, Steve Brewer, Steve Lakey, Daniel Greene, Lora\nCarr, Gary Grant, Michael Short, Daniel Tolle, and Kevin McGinley.\n\n                                        -2-\n\funauthorized double-celling. Plaintiffs made further allegations regarding use of law\nclerks, problems with hygiene and time allowed for recreation, and interference with\nprison mail.\n\n       Rollie in particular sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) against double-\ncelling and the use of boxcar doors, and class certification for all current prisoners\nwho had been in segregation. The district court granted provisional in forma pauperis\n(IFP) status but dismissed the case without prejudice for failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Rollie moved for reconsideration of class certification and\na TRO, and filed an amended complaint. In the complaint, Rollie indicated\ndefendants were being sued only in their official capacities, except for Daniel Greene,\nSteve Lakey, Gary Grant, Michael Short, Daniel Tolle, and Clarence Denzer, who\nwere also being sued in their individual capacities. Rollie also alleged that after he\ncomplained about double-celling, Denzer retaliated by extending Rollie’s sentence\nin solitary confinement from six months to one year, and Tolle, Grant, and Short\nretaliated by issuing conduct-violation reports against Rollie. Rollie claimed he had\nexhausted his administrative remedies.\n\n       The district court reopened the case, agreeing that Rollie had exhausted\nadministrative remedies, and granted leave to file the amended complaint. Thirteen\ndefendants moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or for\njudgment on the pleadings, and opposed the motions for class certification and a\nTRO. In an affidavit accompanying defendants’ opposition to a TRO, Michael\nKemna attested that inmates assigned to CRCC are violent offenders who have been\nunable to adjust to prison discipline in other institutions, or are recidivists with\nsentences of two years or longer; and inmates in AS are more restricted than those in\ngeneral population. In one of the AS housing units, two inmates are assigned to each\ncell, and the cells are solid-walled with a solid steel door, which has a food passage\nand an observation window. In opposition to class certification, defendants argued\nRollie had failed to allege that a large number of inmates had complaints about prison\n\n                                         -3-\n\fconditions and that relief could not be sought on an individual basis, and had failed\nto show that there was an issue common to all inmates, that the issues presented were\ntypical of the claims of the class, and that he was an adequate class representative.\n\n       The district court denied Rollie’s motions for reconsideration of class\ncertification and a TRO and severed and dismissed the thirteen defendants who had\nmoved for dismissal. The court concluded Rollie had failed to state an Eighth\nAmendment violation because he had not alleged serious deprivations of “light, heat,\nventilation, sanitation, clothing [or] a proper diet,” or that defendants intended to\ndeliberately disregard his health and safety. Further, Rollie did not allege any\ninstance where defendants failed to protect him, individually; and he was not denied\naccess to the courts as he had successfully filed numerous complaints such as the\ninstant one. The court did not address Rollie’s retaliation claims.\n\n        The remaining five defendants moved to dismiss, and Rollie moved for leave\nto file a second amended complaint. Rollie also moved to recuse the district court\njudge on the basis that the judge did not understand his claims. The district court\ndenied Rollie’s motion to amend because the five remaining defendants had already\nfiled answers, Rollie had not provided any “new evidence” or shown that the\nproposed new defendants committed a constitutional violation, and he had simply\nincorporated paragraphs from his earlier amended complaint without adding new\ninformation. The court then dismissed the remaining defendants, and dismissed the\ncase with prejudice, for the reasons stated in its earlier dismissal order. Rollie moved\nfor reconsideration, essentially arguing that the court did not give him adequate\nopportunity to develop the record, but the court denied his motion as out of time and\nas lacking a sufficient basis for reconsideration.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                          II.\n\n       Rollie2 timely appeals “all orders denying motions” and “all orders of\ndismissal.” We grant Rollie IFP status, leaving the collection details to the district\ncourt. See Henderson v. Norris, 129 F.3d 481, 484-85 (8th Cir. 1997) (per curiam).\n\n      Initially, we find that Rollie may seek damages only from Greene, Lakey,\nGrant, Short, Tolle, and Denzer, because these are the only defendants against whom\nhe brought individual-capacity claims, but he may proceed against all defendants for\ninjunctive relief. See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 73 (1996) (suits\nbrought under Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), against state officials may\nproceed notwithstanding Eleventh Amendment where plaintiffs seek prospective\ninjunctive relief to end continuing federal law violations); Nix v. Norman, 879 F.2d\n429, 433 n.3 (8th Cir. 1989) (suits seeking damages from state officials in their\nindividual capacities are not barred by Eleventh Amendment).\n\n       We conclude that Rollie stated a failure-to-protect claim, see Springdale Educ.\nAss’n v. Springdale Sch. Dist., 133 F.3d 649, 651 (8th Cir. 1998) (Rule 12(b)(6)\ndismissals are reviewed de novo), as he alleged defendants knew of the assaults\ncaused by double-celling yet did nothing, and even falsified reports to cover up\nunauthorized double-celling, see Nei v. Dooley, 372 F.3d 1003, 1006 (8th Cir. 2004)\n(per curiam) (to prevail on Eighth Amendment failure-to-protect claim, inmates must\nshow they are incarcerated under conditions posing substantial risk of serious harm\nand prison officials subjectively knew of and disregarded that safety risk); Hott v.\nHennepin County, 260 F.3d 901, 906 (8th Cir. 2001) (for purposes of failure-to-\nprotect claims, it does not matter whether prisoner faces excessive risk of attack for\nreasons personal to him or because all prisoners in his situation face such risk); cf.\nJensen v. Clarke, 73 F.3d 808, 811 (8th Cir. 1996) (remanding so district court could\n\n\n      2\n       Rollie is the only plaintiff involved with this appeal.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fassess whether prison officials subjectively knew double-celling posed substantial\nrisk of harm to prisoners’ safety); see also Royal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 724 (8th\nCir. 2004) (factfinder may assess punitive damages in § 1983 action when\ndefendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it\ninvolves reckless or callous indifference to federally protected rights of others).\nBecause we are remanding on this claim, the district court should reconsider Rollie’s\nrequest for a TRO.\n\n       We also conclude that Rollie stated a retaliation claim against Denzer, Tolle,\nGrant, and Short (sued in both their individual and official capacities), as Rollie\nalleged that these defendants took retaliatory measures against him after he\ncomplained about double-celling. See Madewell v. Roberts, 909 F.2d 1203, 1206\n(8th Cir. 1990) (act in retaliation for exercising constitutionally protected right is\nactionable under § 1983 even if act, when taken for another reason, would have been\nproper); cf. Burgess v. Moore, 39 F.3d 216, 218 (8th Cir. 1994) (threat of retaliation\nis sufficient injury if made in retaliation for inmate’s use of prison grievance\nprocedure).\n\n      We conclude, however, that the district court did not err in dismissing Rollie’s\nremaining claims; that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rollie’s\nrequests for class certification, for leave to file a second amended complaint, and for\nreconsideration; and that Rollie’s disagreement with the court’s interpretation of his\nclaims was not a proper basis for recusal. Cf. Lefkowitz v. Citi-Equity Group, Inc.,\n146 F.3d 609, 611-12 (8th Cir. 1998) (recusal motion was properly denied where it\nwas based on nothing more than previous adverse rulings), cert. denied, 525 U.S.\n1154 (1999).\n\n     We note that defendants Alysia Dale, Rebecca Holt, Marilyn Love, and Jean\nYount are not mentioned in reference to the retaliation or failure-to-protect claims.\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fThus, as to these defendants, the judgment is affirmed. As to all other defendants, we\nvacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f",
