Because the court concludes that\nsome of the claims set forth in the complaint were filed more than six years after\nthey first accrued, defendant’s motion to dismiss those claims under Rule 12(b)(1)\nof the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC) must be granted.\nThe court further holds that the remainder of the claims set forth in the complaint\nfail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must be dismissed under\nRCFC 12(b)(6). Accordingly, defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted, and\nDeKalb County’s motion for summary judgment is denied.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND1\n\nI.     Factual History\n\n       A.     The DeKalb County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System\n\n       Most of the rain that falls on undeveloped land is absorbed into the ground.\nBut when land is developed, and the property is covered with impervious surfaces\nsuch as buildings, parking lots, sidewalks, and roads, rainfall cannot be absorbed\nand flows onto adjacent land in higher volumes and at higher velocities than if the\nland had remained in an undeveloped state. This additional runoff increases the\nrisk of flooding for nearby properties and also contributes to water pollution\nbecause the stormwater collects debris, chemicals, and other materials on the\npavement and other impervious surfaces as it travels towards natural waterways.\nStormwater runoff from impervious surfaces also impairs water quality through\nerosion and sedimentation.\n\n       In response to the increased stormwater runoff attributable to development,\nlocal governments have constructed and operated stormwater management systems\nfor many years. The cost of operating such systems has increased dramatically in\nrecent years, due to the accelerated pace of development and new requirements,\nespecially requirements related to the abatement of water pollution, imposed by\nboth state and federal law. While drainage and flood prevention were the primary\n\n\n       1\n       / The facts recounted here are taken from the parties’ submissions in this case and are\nundisputed. Unless otherwise noted, the court makes no findings of fact in this opinion.\n\n                                               2\n\fimpetus for the development of stormwater management systems, environmental\nprotection has become an increasingly important – perhaps the primary –\nconsideration in the design and management of such systems.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. No.\n92-500, 86 Stat. 816, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA),\ncreated the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which\nrequires a permit from either the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or an\nEPA-approved state agency, in order to discharge any type of pollutant from a\npoint source into the waters of the United States. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1342\n(2006). In enacting the CWA, Congress declared that the statute’s purpose was\n“to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the\nNation’s waters.” 86 Stat. 816. Further, “it [was] the policy of the Congress to\nrecognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to\nprevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.” Id.\n\n       In general, municipal separate storm sewer systems divert and collect\nstormwater and then discharge that water, untreated, into natural waterways.\nBecause those systems discharge pollutants into the waters of the United States,\nthey are treated as point sources under the CWA, as amended, and are required to\nobtain an NPDES permit, which imposes stringent requirements on their design\nand operation.2 See 33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B) (stating that NPDES permits for\nmunicipal storm sewers must prohibit the discharge of anything other than\nstormwater into the system and “shall require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices,\ncontrol techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other\nprovisions as the Administrator or the state determines appropriate for the control\nof such pollutants”).\n\n      DeKalb County, Georgia (the County), a political subdivision of the State of\nGeorgia, owns and operates the DeKalb County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer\nSystem (the stormwater management system), which was developed over many\n\n       2\n        / There was no NPDES permit requirement for stormwater discharges until Congress\npassed the Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-4, sec. 405, 101 Stat. 7, 69-71. The EPA\npromulgated the first regulations implementing the new requirement in 1990. National Pollutant\nDischarge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges,\n55 Fed. Reg. 47,990 (Nov. 16, 1990) (codified at 40 C.F.R. pts. 122-124).\n\n                                              3\n\fyears.3 Code of DeKalb County (County Code) § 25-360(c). The system is\noperated in accordance with an NPDES permit issued by the State of Georgia and\nis also subject to additional requirements under state law. See Compl. ¶ 13; Pl.’s\nResp. at 1-2.\n\n        In December 2003, the County’s board of commissioners adopted a new\nstormwater management ordinance, which created a new stormwater utility that\nwould be “responsible for stormwater management throughout the county’s\njurisdictional limits, and [would] provide for the management, protection, control,\nregulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities.” County\nCode § 25-362(a). The board of commissioners transferred to the new stormwater\nutility “operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and\nfacilities owned and heretofore operated by the county and other related assets,\nincluding but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located,\neasements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.” Id. § 25-362(b).\nMost relevant to this case, the stormwater ordinance established a new system of\n“stormwater service fees” to fund the operations of the new utility. Id. § 25-365.\n\n        Under the ordinance, the owners of all developed property located within the\nunincorporated portions of the county are required to pay an annual assessment\nthat is generally based on the impervious surface area located on the property.4\nThe charge assessed on developed properties is equal to $4.00 per month for each\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         / The County is authorized to establish a stormwater management system under the\nHome Rule section of the Georgia Constitution. See Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, sec. 2, par. III\n(a)(6) (stating that counties may provide “[s]torm water and sewage collection and disposal\nsystems”). Under state statute, the County is authorized to “prescribe, revise, and collect rates,\nfees, tolls, or charges” for systems, plants, works, instrumentalities, and properties “used or\nuseful in connection with the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage, waste, and storm\nwater.” Ga. Code Ann. §§ 36-82-61(4)(C)(ii), 36-82-62(a)(3) (West 2012).\n       4\n         / The ordinance applies only to the unincorporated portions of DeKalb County because\nthe County cannot exercise its authority within the boundaries of incorporated municipalities that\nare located inside of its borders. See Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, sec. 2, par. III(b)(1) (“No county\nmay exercise any of the powers listed in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph or provide any\nservice listed therein inside the boundaries of any municipality or any other county except by\ncontract with the municipality or county affected[.]”).\n\n                                                 4\n\fEquivalent Residential Unit (ERU).5 Id. § 25-365(b). Single-family dwellings are\nassessed the rate applicable to one ERU; multiple-family dwellings are assessed the\nrate applicable to one ERU, multiplied by the number of dwelling units on the\nproperty, multiplied by an adjustment factor of 0.5; and all other developed\nproperties are assessed the rate applicable to one ERU for every 3000 square feet\nof impervious surface area on the property, rounded up to the next highest tenth of\nan ERU. Id. § 25-365(c)-(e).\n\n      The stormwater management charges do not apply to undeveloped land,\npublic rights of way, railroad rights of way, or “[a]ny property whereby one\nhundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained on the premises and\nno runoff enters into the stormwater management system.” Id. § 25-368. Further,\nproperty owners may apply for credits against the stormwater assessment by\nimplementing specified systems and facilities on their own property, but the credits\nmay amount to no more than forty percent of the total charge. Id. § 25-369(a).\n\n        The ordinance provides that the revenue generated by the new assessments\nmust be deposited into an “enterprise fund,” which is to be used only for costs\nincurred in connection with the stormwater management system. County Code\n§ 25-364. Under the ordinance, the County may appropriate additional funds for\nthe system, but the revenue in the enterprise fund may not be devoted to any other\npurpose. While revenue that is deposited into the enterprise fund may be pledged\n“to the payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on any revenue bonds\nor other obligations lawfully issued or otherwise contracted for by the county as\nmay be provided in any resolution authorizing such bonds or obligations or in any\ntrust instrument relating to such bonds or obligations[,]” id. § 25-364(c), the\nreferenced bonds are limited to those related solely to the stormwater management\nsystem, see Tr. at 35-36.\n\n       The ordinance provides that the “stormwater service fee shall accrue\nbeginning January 1, 2004, and shall be billed annually thereafter.” Id. § 25-366.\nThe charge may be billed separately or collected “with other fees for services, . . .\nprovided that in no instance shall the service charge constitute a direct lien against\nthe property.” Id. § 25-371(a). The County may send the bill for the assessment\n\n       5\n          / The ERU was calculated based on the county’s median impervious coverage for a\nstatistical sampling of lots improved with detached, single-family dwellings. See County Code\n§ 25-361 (definition of “Equivalent Residential Unit”).\n\n                                               5\n\fthrough the mail or by other means, and that bill must indicate “the amount of the\nbill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due.” Id. § 25-371(b).\n\n       In practice, the County often includes the amount of the stormwater charge\ndue for each property owner as a line item on the annual bill sent during the\nsummer for fees and ad valorem taxes. Affidavit of John G. Booth (Booth Aff.)\n¶ 6. The United States and other tax-exempt property owners, in contrast, are\nbilled for the assessment on a separate “Stormwater Utility Notice.” Id. The\nCounty assesses these charges against its own property, and also pays stormwater\nmanagement charges imposed by municipalities and other counties in which it\nowns property. See Affidavit of Joel Gottlieb ¶¶ 3-5.\n\n       B.      The Federal Facilities Section of the Clean Water Act\n\n       Since its original enactment in 1972, the CWA has included a provision\nknown as the Federal Facilities Section, 33 U.S.C. § 1323 (2006), which requires\nthe federal government to meet the same water pollution abatement requirements\nas those applicable to private entities.6 In this case, the County argues that the\nFederal Facilities Section, which was amended in 1977 and again in 2011, waives\nthe federal government’s sovereign immunity from the stormwater utility charges\nthat plaintiff seeks to recover in this case. Because the Federal Facilities Section is\ncentral to the County’s case, the court will examine its history in some detail.\n\n               1.      The 1972 Version\n\n      In the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the\nrelevant portion of the Federal Facilities Section read as follows:\n\n               Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the\n               executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\n               Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any\n               property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity\n\n       6\n         / The various sections of the CWA are often referred to as they appeared in the law\nenacted by Congress, rather than as they were ultimately codified in the United States Code.\nThe Federal Facilities Section, for example, is sometimes referred to as section 313 of the CWA,\neven though it is codified at 33 U.S.C. § 1323. In this opinion, the court will refer to that section\nas it was codified (i.e., as “section 1323”).\n\n                                                  6\n\f             resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff\n             of pollutants shall comply with Federal, State, interstate,\n             and local requirements respecting control and abatement\n             of pollution to the same extent that any person is subject\n             to such requirements, including the payment of\n             reasonable service charges.\n\nPub. L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816, 875.\n\n      The Senate Report on the 1972 CWA states that the purpose of section 1323\nwas to “require[] that Federal facilities meet the same effluent limitations as private\nsources of pollution, unless the Federal facility is specifically exempted by the\nPresident.” S. Rep. No. 92-414, at 67, reprinted in 1971 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3668, 3733.\nThere is no discussion in either the text of the statute or in the Senate Report as to\nwhat types of charges the term “reasonable service charges” was intended to\nencompass.\n\n             2.     The 1977 Version\n\n       In EPA v. California EPA ex rel. State Water Resources Control Board,\n426 U.S. 200 (1976), the Supreme Court held that the Federal Facilities Section of\nthe CWA did not require federal agencies to meet state permitting requirements\nrelated to the abatement of water pollution. The Supreme Court first explained that\nfederal properties “are subject to state regulation only when and to the extent that\ncongressional authorization is clear and unambiguous.” Id. at 211. Next, the Court\nheld that section 1323 did not expressly require federal agencies to obtain an\nNPDES permit from the state to discharge effluents into navigable waters. Finally,\naccording to the Court, none of the express terms of section 1323 – including the\nrequirement that the federal government pay reasonable service charges – could be\nread to contain an implied requirement to obtain such a permit.\n\n       Congress amended section 1323 in 1977, noting in the Senate Report on the\namendment that “[t]he act has been amended to indicate unequivocally that all\nFederal facilities and activities are subject to all of the provisions of State and local\npollution laws.” S. Rep. No. 95-370, at 67 (1977), reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n4326, 4392. The report explains that “the Supreme Court, encouraged by Federal\nagencies, ha[d] misconstrued the original intent [of the 1972 law].” Id. The report\nfurther notes that because\n\n                                            7\n\f             the substantive requirements of the act and of State and\n             local law would be unenforceable unless procedural\n             provisions were also met[,] section 313 is amended to\n             specify that, as in the case of air pollution, a Federal\n             facility is subject to any Federal, State, and local\n             requirement respecting the control or abatement of water\n             pollution, both substantive and procedural, to the same\n             extent as any person is subject to these requirements.\n             This includes, but is not limited to, requirements to\n             obtain operating and construction permits, reporting and\n             monitoring requirements, any provisions for injunctive\n             relief and such sanctions imposed by a court to enforce\n             such relief, and the payment of reasonable service\n             charges.\n\nId. at 4392-93. Section 1323, as amended in 1977 and as it still reads today, states\nthat\n\n             [e]ach department, agency, or instrumentality of the\n             executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\n             Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any\n             property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity\n             resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff\n             of pollutants, and each officer, agent, or employee\n             thereof in the performance of his official duties, shall be\n             subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate,\n             and local requirements, administrative authority, and\n             process and sanctions respecting the control and\n             abatement of water pollution in the same manner, and to\n             the same extent as any nongovernmental entity including\n             the payment of reasonable service charges.\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1323(a) (emphasis added to indicate changes made by amendment).\nThe amended section also states that its mandate applies “to any requirement,\nwhether substantive or procedural,” “to the exercise of any Federal, State, or local\nadministrative authority,” and “to any process and sanction, whether enforced in\nFederal, state, or local courts or in any other matter.” Id. Finally, the 1977 version\nof section 1323 states that “[t]his subsection shall apply notwithstanding any\n\n                                          8\n\fimmunity of such agencies, officers, agents, or employees under any law or rule of\nlaw.” Id.\n\n             3.    The 2011 Version\n\n       Despite the 1977 amendment to the Federal Facilities Section of the CWA,\nthe federal government routinely refused to pay the types of stormwater charges at\nissue in this case, arguing that such charges were taxes rather than fees, and did not\nfall within the waiver of immunity contained in section 1323(a). In response,\nSenator Ben Cardin introduced a bill to add two new subsections to section 1323,\nwithout changing the text of section 1323(a):\n\n             (c)   Federal Responsibility for Stormwater Pollution.\n                   Reasonable service charges described in subsection\n                   (a) include reasonable fees or assessments made\n                   for the purpose of stormwater management in the\n                   same manner and to the same extent as any\n                   nongovernmental entity.\n\n             (d)   No Treatment as Tax or Levy. A fee or assessment\n                   described in this section –\n\n                   (1)    shall not be considered to be a tax or other\n                          levy subject to an assertion of sovereign\n                          immunity; and\n\n                   (2)    may be paid using appropriated funds.\n\nS. 3481, 111th Cong. (2010) (as introduced), 156 Cong. Rec. S4851, S4856.\n\n        In introducing his proposed amendment to the Federal Facilities Section,\nSenator Cardin noted the government’s persistent refusal to pay reasonable\nstormwater management charges, and explained that “[a]dopting the legislation\nthat I am introducing today will remove all ambiguity about the responsibility of\nthe Federal Government to pay these normal and customary stormwater fees.”\n156 Cong. Rec. S4851, S4856 (2010) (statement of Senator Cardin).\n\n      Congress ultimately passed an amended version of Senator Cardin’s bill,\n\n                                          9\n\fwhich the President signed into law on January 4, 2011:\n\n             (c)   Reasonable Service Charges –\n\n             (1)   In general. For the purposes of this Act,\n                   reasonable service charges described in subsection\n                   (a) include any reasonable nondiscriminatory fee,\n                   charge, or assessment that is –\n\n                   (A)    based on some fair approximation of the\n                          proportionate contribution of the property or\n                          facility to stormwater pollution (in terms of\n                          quantities of pollutants, or volume or rate of\n                          stormwater discharge or runoff from the\n                          property or facility); and\n\n                   (B)    used to pay or reimburse the costs associated\n                          with any stormwater management program\n                          (whether associated with a separate storm\n                          sewer system or a sewer system that\n                          manages a combination of stormwater and\n                          sanitary waste), including the full range of\n                          programmatic and structural costs\n                          attributable to collecting stormwater,\n                          reducing pollutants in stormwater, and\n                          reducing the volume and rate of stormwater\n                          discharge, regardless of whether that\n                          reasonable fee, charge, or assessment is\n                          denominated a tax.\n\nPub. L. No. 111-378, 124 Stat. 4128 (2011). In addition, the amendment stated\nthat federal agencies “shall not be obligated to pay or reimburse any fee, charge, or\nassessment described in paragraph (1), except to the extent and in an amount\nprovided in advance by any appropriations Act to pay or reimburse the fee, charge,\nor assessment.” Id. at 4128-29.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f       C.      The Federal Properties in this Case\n\n       The United States owns a number of properties located within the county.\nIn this case, the County seeks to recover unpaid stormwater management charges\nassessed against eighteen different properties – six owned by the United States and\ntwelve owned by the Postal Service – for the years 2005 through 2010. Plaintiff\nasserts that the government has been inconsistent in its payment of stormwater\nmanagement charges for its properties, “paying the fees in full for some properties\nand facilities and refusing to pay for other similar properties and facilities.”\nCompl. ¶ 27. The County has demanded payment of the charges for many years,\nand notified the government of its intent to pursue its claims in court in letters\ndated March 9, 2010 and October 13, 2011. Id. ¶¶ 28-29.\n\n       The government concedes that it is now required, under section 1323, to pay\nall stormwater management charges accruing after January 4, 2011, the date of the\nmost recent amendment to that section.7 In this case, the parties do not dispute\nwhether the government is required to pay those charges now and in the future.\nRather, the parties’ disagreement here centers on whether the government is liable\nto the County for charges that were assessed against federal properties in the years\n2005 through 2010.\n\nII.    Procedural History\n\n       On November 14, 2011, the County filed its complaint in this case, in which\nit argues that the federal government has waived its sovereign immunity from\n“reasonable service charges” under section 1323 of the Clean Water Act, and that\nthe stormwater management charges plaintiff seeks to recover in this case are\nwithin the scope of that waiver. The County requests $281,553.12 in damages,\nplus interest, attorneys’ fees, and other related expenses. The amount requested by\nthe County is limited to charges that accrued before section 1323 was amended on\n\n\n       7\n         / While the government concedes that the 2011 amendment of section 1323 created a\nprospective obligation to pay the County’s stormwater management charges, there is some\nuncertainty with respect to the government’s diligence in making those payments. Compare\nPl.’s Resp. at 16 n.9 (stating that the United States has “paid the majority of such fees incurred\nsince § 1323(c) became law on January 4, 2011”) with Booth Aff. ¶ 9 (“No [fewer] than fifteen\n(15) federal facilities are now delinquent in paying stormwater utility fees due DeKalb County\nfor calendar year 2011.”).\n\n                                                11\n\fJanuary 4, 2011.\n\n       On February 27, 2012, the government filed a motion to dismiss this action\npursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6). Defendant raises two arguments\nin its motion to dismiss. First, defendant argues that any claims that accrued before\nNovember 14, 2005 must be dismissed as untimely under 28 U.S.C. § 2501 (2006).\nSecond, defendant asserts that each of the County’s remaining claims must be\ndismissed for failure to state a claim because those claims seek the recovery of\nstate taxes that were levied upon federal properties before the United States waived\nits immunity from such taxes.\n\n       On April 30, 2012, the County filed its response to the government’s motion\nto dismiss, as well as a motion for partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.\nIn response to defendant’s argument that some of the County’s claims were not\ntimely, plaintiff asserts that its stormwater management charges are not due until\nDecember 31st of each year, and do not become delinquent until January 1st of the\nfollowing year. For that reason, plaintiff argues that none of its claims accrued\nbefore January 1, 2006, which was less than six years before it filed its suit in this\ncourt. With respect to defendant’s argument that the County’s charges are\nimpermissible taxes that were not covered by the pre-2011 version of section 1323,\nplaintiff responds that its charges are not taxes but fees, which fall squarely within\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section 1323.\n\n       On May 7, 2012, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the\nNational Association of Flood and Stormwater Management Agencies, and the\nAmerican Public Works Association filed a motion for leave of the court to file an\namicus curiae brief in support of the County. The court granted that motion on\nMay 15, 2012. In their brief, amici argue that the 2011 amendment should not be\nread to contain a new waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity. Instead,\naccording to amici, the 2011 amendment must be viewed as a mere clarification of\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity contained in the earlier version of section 1323.\nFor that reason, amici contend that the government is liable for the charges that\naccrued before the 2011 amendment was enacted.\n\n      On July 20, 2012, defendant filed a reply in support of its motion to dismiss,\nas well as its response to the County’s motion for summary judgment. In its reply,\nthe government rejects the County’s contention that none of the charges assessed in\n2005 accrued until January 1, 2006. In that regard, the government notes that the\n\n                                          12\n\fCounty sent the government an invoice for approximately half of those charges in\nthe summer of 2005, and that the invoice informed the government that the charges\nwere due no later than August 15, 2005. For that reason, the government argues\nthat any claims related to those charges accrued more than six years before the\ncomplaint was filed in this case. The government further asserts that the charges at\nissue in this case are taxes rather than fees, that the government had not waived its\nimmunity from such taxes until January 2011, and that the 2011 amendment cannot\nbe read as a clarification of an earlier waiver of immunity.\n\n        On September 25, 2012, the County filed its reply in support of its motion\nfor summary judgment. In its reply, the County disagrees with the legal tests\nendorsed by the government in its motion, but further argues that its stormwater\nutility charges are fees irrespective of which test is applied. The County also\nendorses and adopts the principal argument advanced by amici in their brief, i.e.,\nthat the 2011 amendment to section 1323 may be applied retroactively as a\nclarification of the earlier version of that section.\n\n      This matter was transferred to the undersigned pursuant to RCFC 40.1 on\nOctober 17, 2012, and the court heard oral argument from counsel on the parties’\ndispositive motions on November 30, 2012.8\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\nI.     Standards of Review\n\n       A.      RCFC 12(b)(1)\n\n       In rendering a decision on a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction pursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1), this court must presume all undisputed\nfactual allegations to be true and must construe all reasonable inferences in favor\nof the plaintiff. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974), abrogated on other\ngrounds by Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814-15 (1982); Reynolds v. Army\n& Air Force Exch. Serv., 846 F.2d 746, 747 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The relevant issue in\na motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(1) “‘is not whether a plaintiff will\n\n\n       8\n        / With the court’s permission, counsel for the County yielded a portion of his time for\noral argument to counsel for amici.\n\n                                               13\n\fultimately prevail but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support\nthe claims.’” Patton v. United States, 64 Fed. Cl. 768, 773 (2005) (quoting\nScheuer, 416 U.S. at 236). The plaintiff bears the burden of establishing subject\nmatter jurisdiction, Alder Terrace, Inc. v. United States, 161 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed.\nCir. 1998) (citing McNutt v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178,\n189 (1936)), and must do so by a preponderance of the evidence, Reynolds, 846\nF.2d at 748 (citations omitted). The court may look at evidence outside of the\npleadings in order to determine its jurisdiction over a case. Martinez v. United\nStates, 48 Fed. Cl. 851, 857 (2001) (citing RHI Holdings, Inc. v. United States, 142\nF.3d 1459, 1461-62 (Fed. Cir. 1998); Rocovich v. United States, 933 F.2d 991, 993\n(Fed. Cir. 1991)), aff’d in relevant part, 281 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2002). “Indeed,\nthe court may, and often must, find facts on its own.” Id. If jurisdiction is found to\nbe lacking, this court must dismiss the action. RCFC 12(h)(3).\n\n      B.     RCFC 12(b)(6)\n\n       It is well-settled that a complaint should be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(6)\n“when the facts asserted by the claimant do not entitle him to a legal remedy.”\nLindsay v. United States, 295 F.3d 1252, 1257 (Fed. Cir. 2002). When considering\na motion to dismiss under this rule, “the allegations of the complaint should be\nconstrued favorably to the pleader.” Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236. “[W]hen the\nallegations in a complaint, however true, could not raise a claim of entitlement to\nrelief,” dismissal is warranted under RCFC 12(b)(6). Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 558 (2007). To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to\nstate a claim, a complaint must contain “more than labels and conclusions, and a\nformulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.” Id. at 555.\nWhile a complaint is not required to contain detailed factual allegations, it must\nprovide “enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. at\n570. In order to meet the requirement of facial plausibility, the plaintiff must plead\n“factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the\ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n678 (2009).\n\nII.   Analysis\n\n       In its motion, defendant advances two separate grounds for dismissing the\nclaims set forth in the County’s complaint. First, defendant argues that any claims\nrelated to stormwater utility charges that were billed to the government more than\n\n                                           14\n\fsix years before the complaint was filed are precluded by the court’s statute of\nlimitations and must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1). Second, defendant\nasserts that the remaining claims must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(6) because\n(1) the County’s assessments constitute taxes; (2) the government did not waive its\nimmunity from state or local taxes used to fund stormwater management systems\nuntil January 4, 2011; and (3) that waiver may not be applied retroactively to cover\nstormwater utility charges that were levied before that date.\n\n        The court must first address the County’s assertion that defendant’s motion\nto dismiss must be converted into a motion for summary judgment because it relies\non material outside of the pleadings. That assertion is incorrect for three reasons.\nFirst, the court is not required to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for\nsummary judgment unless the court relies upon evidence outside of the pleadings\nin resolving the motion. See RCFC 12(d) (requiring conversion only when\n“matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court”)\n(emphasis added). Neither of the documents attached to the government’s motion\nto dismiss is necessary to the court’s resolution of that motion.\n\n       Furthermore, to the extent that the court must rely on any material outside of\nthe pleadings in this case, such reliance is limited to the government’s motion to\ndismiss under RCFC 12(b)(1). The requirement set forth in RCFC 12(d) – i.e., that\nmotions to dismiss must be treated as motions for summary judgment when the\ncourt relies on evidence outside of the pleadings – is, by its own terms, limited to\nmotions to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6) and RCFC 12(c). In resolving motions to\ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under RCFC 12(b)(1), in contrast,\nthe court is free to make findings of fact based on evidence not contained in the\npleadings. See Rocovich, 933 F.2d at 993; Martinez, 48 Fed. Cl. at 857.\n\n      Finally, both of the documents attached to the government’s motion to\ndismiss are matters of public record that were printed from the County’s own\nwebsite. The court may consider those documents in resolving the motion to\ndismiss without converting that motion into one for summary judgment. See\nSebastian v. United States, 185 F.3d 1368, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“In deciding\nwhether to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the court may consider\nmatters of public record.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f      A.     Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       In its motion to dismiss, defendant argues that this court does not have\njurisdiction over any claims for the recovery of stormwater utility charges that\nwere billed to the government more than six years before the County filed its\ncomplaint in this case. Because the complaint was filed on November 14, 2011,\ndefendant argues that the County’s attempt to recoup unpaid stormwater charges\nthat were billed more than six years before that date are untimely under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2501. Further, although the issue was not raised by defendant, the court must\ndetermine whether plaintiff has identified a money-mandating source of\nsubstantive law for purposes of this court’s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act,\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (2006). For the reasons set forth below, the court holds\nthat plaintiff has identified a money-mandating source of law, but further\nconcludes that the County’s claims to recover stormwater utility charges that were\nbilled to the government before November 14, 2005 are untimely and must be\ndismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n             1.    The Court Does Not Possess Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n                   over Claims for the Recovery of Stormwater Utility Charges\n                   Billed to Defendant before November 14, 2005\n\n        Section 2501 provides in relevant part that “[e]very claim of which the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the\npetition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2501. The United States Supreme Court has held that the six-year limitations\nperiod is an absolute jurisdictional bar that cannot be waived by the government.\nSee John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 133-34 (2008)\n(holding that the statute of limitations contained in section 2501 is jurisdictional\nand is not subject to tolling, waiver, or estoppel). The County filed its suit on\nNovember 14, 2011. In order to be considered within the limitations period set\nforth in section 2501, the County’s claims must have accrued no earlier than\nNovember 14, 2005. If any of its claims accrued before that date, then the court is\nwithout jurisdiction to hear them. The Federal Circuit has explained that a claim\nfirst accrues for purposes of the six-year limitations period “when all the events\nhave occurred which fix the liability of the Government and entitle the claimant to\ninstitute an action.” Alder Terrace, 161 F.3d at 1377.\n\n      The County asserts that the stormwater management charges it levied on\n\n                                          16\n\ffederal properties in 2005 were not due until the end of that year and did not\nbecome delinquent until January 1, 2006. See Booth Aff. ¶ 5. In addition, the\nCounty contends that a claim seeking payment for services rendered accrues, and\nthe statute of limitations begins to run, only when “‘the last services are\nrendered.’” Pl.’s Resp. at 19 (quoting Empire Inst. of Tailoring, Inc. v. United\nStates, 142 Ct. Cl. 165, 168 (1958)). Inasmuch as the charges for 2005 were based\non services that plaintiff argues were rendered until December 31, 2005, the\nCounty contends that its claims related to the recovery of those charges were\ntimely because they did not accrue more than six years before the complaint was\nfiled in this case.\n\n       Defendant, in contrast, contends that under the continuing claims doctrine,\n“‘the cause of action for pay or compensation accrues as soon as the payor fails or\nrefuses to pay what the law (or the contract) requires; there is no other condition\nprecedent to the accrual of the cause of action.’” Def.’s Reply at 7 (quoting\nFriedman v. United States, 310 F.2d 381, 385 (Ct. Cl. 1962)). Furthermore,\naccording to defendant, “‘where the payments are to be made periodically, each\nsuccessive failure to make proper payment gives rise to a new claim upon which\nsuit can be brought.’” Id. at 8 (citation omitted). The government received an\ninvoice for stormwater management charges in the summer of 2005. On that\ninvoice, the County stated that the stormwater utility charge is calculated on an\nannual basis, but is due in two equal installments on August 15, 2005, and\nNovember 15, 2005. See Booth Aff. Ex. 1. Based on that invoice, the government\nargues that any of the County’s claims related to stormwater charges levied on\nfederal properties in the first half of 2005 are untimely.9\n\n      The County does not dispute that it sent an invoice to the government for its\ncharges in July 2005, see Tr. at 53, and that invoice expressly states that the\ncharges “are due in two equal installments: August 15th and November 15th,”\nBooth Aff. Ex. 1. The County argues, however, that the dates indicated on the\n\n\n       9\n        / In its motion, defendant asserts that the County’s stormwater management charges\naccrue on a continuous basis beginning on January 1st of each year. Based on that assertion,\ndefendant argues that more than ten months’ worth of the charges imposed on federal properties\nin 2005 are time-barred under section 2501. In its reply in support of its motion, however, the\ngovernment appears to have abandoned that argument, instead asserting that the County’s claims\nare untimely with respect to half of the stormwater management charges levied in 2005 – i.e.,\nthose included on the July 2005 invoice.\n\n                                              17\n\finvoice are not really due dates. Rather, plaintiff contends those dates allow\nproperty owners to prepay their stormwater charges as an administrative\nconvenience, but the charges were not actually due until December 31, 2005. Id.\n¶¶ 5-7.\n\n       The County’s argument is not, however, supported by the record in this case.\nNothing in the stormwater ordinance states that stormwater management\nassessments are due on December 31st, or that they are not considered delinquent\nuntil January 1st of the following year. Instead, the ordinance states that “[t]he\nstormwater service fee shall accrue beginning January 1, 2004, and shall be billed\nannually thereafter.” County Code § 25-366. The ordinance also requires the\nCounty to inform property owners of the date on which the charges are due, and\nrequires property owners to pay a one percent per month late fee for charges that\nare delinquent.10 Id. § 25-371(b). The County sent the government an invoice for\nstormwater utility charges in July 2005, and that invoice unequivocally informed\nthe government that half of its annual liability for those charges was due no later\nthan August 15th of that year. Because the government did not pay the\nassessments for the first half of 2005 by the specified date, the County could have\ncommenced an action to recover those charges the next day, on August 16, 2005.\nThus, the deputy tax commissioner’s statement that the charges were not actually\ndelinquent until January 1st of the next year cannot override the August 15th\ndeadline imposed by the County’s invoice or suspend the accrual of the County’s\nclaims for purposes of the limitations period. For the foregoing reasons, the court\nholds that any claims related to stormwater charges for the first half of 2005 were\nuntimely and must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n               2.      Section 1323(a) of the Clean Water Act Is a\n                       Money-Mandating Source of Law for Purposes\n                       of this Court’s Jurisdiction under the Tucker Act\n\n       With respect to the remaining claims presented by plaintiff, in order to\nestablish jurisdiction in this court, the County must demonstrate that the\n\n       10\n          / While the County describes the stormwater assessment as an annual charge, and the\nordinance states that those charges shall be billed annually, see County Code § 25-366, the\nordinance states that the charges are to be calculated on a monthly, rather than annual, basis, see\nid. § 25-365(b) (“The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit shall be four\ndollars ($4.00) per month or as amended by official action of the governing authority.”).\n\n                                                18\n\fgovernment has consented to suit and that there is a substantive legal basis for such\nclaims. See United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, 472\n(2003) (White Mountain Apache) (“Jurisdiction over any suit against the\nGovernment requires a clear statement from the United States waiving sovereign\nimmunity, together with a claim falling within the terms of the waiver.”)\n(citations omitted).\n\n     The County asserts that this court has jurisdiction over its claims under the\nTucker Act,11 which provides in relevant part that the\n\n               United States Court of Federal Claims shall have\n               jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against\n               the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or\n               any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive\n               department, or upon any express or implied contract with\n               the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated\n               damages in cases not sounding in tort.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). The Federal Circuit has explained that the Tucker Act\n“does two things: (1) it confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal Claims over\nthe specified categories of actions brought against the United States, and\n(2) it waives the Government’s sovereign immunity for those actions.” Fisher v.\n\n\n       11\n          / The County also asserts that this court may exercise jurisdiction over suits against the\nPostal Service under 39 U.S.C. § 401 (2006). With respect to federal jurisdiction, however, that\nsection simply provides that the Postal Service may “sue and be sued in its official name.” Id.\n§ 401(1). Another section of the same title addresses suits by and against the Postal Service, but\nthat section states only that “the United States district courts shall have original but not exclusive\njurisdiction over all actions brought by or against the Postal Service.” 39 U.S.C. § 409(a)\n(2006). Defendant does not contest this court’s jurisdiction over the Postal Service under the\nTucker Act, and this court routinely exercises such jurisdiction. See generally Emery Worldwide\nAirlines, Inc. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 211, 220 (noting that the Postal Service is an “agency”\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 451 (2006) and is therefore subject to this court’s jurisdiction under the\nTucker Act), aff’d, 264 F.3d 1071, 1080 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The County is incorrect, however, in\nits assertion that the Postal Service may be named as a separate defendant in this case, distinct\nfrom the United States. Under the Tucker Act, the United States is the only defendant over\nwhich this court may properly exercise subject matter jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1); see\nalso RCFC 10(a) (noting that the United States must be designated as the defendant in this\ncourt).\n\n                                                 19\n\fUnited States, 402 F.3d 1167, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (en banc in relevant part).\nHowever, the statute “does not create a substantive cause of action; in order to\ncome within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff\nmust identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money\ndamages.” Id.\n\n       The substantive source of law upon which the County relies to establish this\ncourt’s subject matter jurisdiction under the Tucker Act is section 1323(a), which\nstates that\n\n             [e]ach department, agency, or instrumentality of the\n             executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\n             Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any\n             property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity\n             resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff\n             of pollutants, and each officer, agent, or employee\n             thereof in the performance of his official duties, shall be\n             subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate,\n             and local requirements, administrative authority, and\n             process and sanctions respecting the control and\n             abatement of water pollution in the same manner, and to\n             the same extent as any nongovernmental entity including\n             the payment of reasonable service charges.\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1323(a) (emphasis added).\n\n       Importantly, section 1323(a) states that the government “shall” be subject to\nfederal, state, and local water pollution requirements “including the payment of\nreasonable services charges.” In general, the Federal Circuit has held that when\nCongress uses the mandatory term “shall” in a statute to describe the government’s\nobligation to make a payment to a party or group, the statute is money mandating.\nSee Greenlee Cnty., Ariz. v. United States, 487 F.3d 871, 877 (Fed. Cir. 2007)\n(noting that “use of the word ‘shall’ generally makes a statute money-mandating”);\nAgwiak v. United States, 347 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (“We have\nrepeatedly recognized that the use of the word ‘shall’ generally makes a statute\nmoney-mandating.”). Defendant does not contend that the government has any\ndiscretion to choose whether to comply with the requirements of section 1323;\nrather, the dispute between the parties is over the precise scope of that provision –\n\n                                          20\n\fi.e., whether the term “reasonable service charges” includes the type of charges at\nissue in this case.\n\n      In order to waive the government’s sovereign immunity, Congress must use\nlanguage that is unequivocal and unambiguous. See United States v. Mitchell,\n445 U.S. 535, 538 (1980) (noting that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be\n“unequivocally expressed”). In contrast, the\n\n              “fair interpretation” rule demands a showing\n              demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial\n              waiver of sovereign immunity. “Because the Tucker Act\n              supplies a waiver of immunity for claims of this nature,\n              the separate statutes and regulations need not provide a\n              second waiver of sovereign immunity, nor need they be\n              construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of\n              sovereign immunity.” It is enough, then, that a statute\n              creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to\n              the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in\n              damages. While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will\n              not be “lightly inferred,” a fair inference will do.\n\nWhite Mountain Apache, 537 U.S. at 472-73 (citations omitted).\n\n      As the court will discuss below, Congress did not waive the government’s\nimmunity from the type of charges at issue in this case until January 4, 2011.12\nHowever, that conclusion – that the County’s stormwater management charges are\nnot covered by the pre-2011 version of section 1323 – does not require the court to\ndismiss the County’s claims under RCFC 12(b)(1). Rather, as the Federal Circuit\nhas explained,\n\n              [a]ssuming that the Court of Federal Claims has taken\n              jurisdiction over the cause as a result of the initial\n              determination that plaintiff’s cause rests on a money-\n\n       12\n         / There are two types of sovereign immunity implicated in this case. First, there is the\ngovernment’s immunity from suit, which was waived by the Tucker Act. In addition, there is the\ngovernment’s immunity from state and local taxation to fund stormwater management systems,\nwhich, as discussed in detail below, was not waived until January 4, 2011.\n\n                                               21\n\f             mandating source, the consequence of a ruling by the\n             court on the merits, that plaintiff’s case does not fit\n             within the scope of the source, is simply this: plaintiff\n             loses on the merits for failing to state a claim on which\n             relief can be granted.\n\nFisher, 402 F.3d at 1175-76. The same is true here. The court may exercise\njurisdiction over the County’s claims in this case, at least those that are timely,\nbecause section 1323 may fairly be interpreted to mandate the payment of money\nby the government. Notwithstanding that jurisdictional basis, the County has\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it has failed to\ndemonstrate that its stormwater management charges fall within the scope of\nsection 1323.\n\n      B.     Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n       In its motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6), defendant argues that the\ncharges the County seeks to recover in this case are taxes that may not be imposed\non federal properties or facilities without the prior consent of the United States.\nDefendant concedes that Congress waived the government’s immunity from such\ntaxes when it amended section 1323 on January 4, 2011, but argues that the waiver\ncontained in the 2011 amendment cannot be applied retroactively, nor may it be\nviewed as an attempt by Congress to clarify an earlier waiver of immunity. In\norder to resolve the government’s motion, the court must address three separate\nquestions.\n\n       First, are the stormwater management charges at issue in this case properly\nviewed as taxes or fees? Second, if the charges are taxes rather than fees, did the\ngovernment unequivocally and unambiguously waive its immunity from such taxes\nin the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act? Finally, if the government did\nnot clearly waive its sovereign immunity in 1977, may the 2011 amendment be\ngiven retroactive effect as a mere clarification of the 1977 waiver, rather than as a\nnew and separate waiver of sovereign immunity?\n\n       The court concludes that the County’s stormwater management charge is a\ntax that cannot be imposed upon federal properties without the consent of the\nUnited States. The court further holds that Congress did not unequivocally waive\nthe federal government’s sovereign immunity from state taxation in 1977, and that\n\n                                         22\n\fthe 2011 amendment cannot be applied retroactively as a clarification of the initial\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. For those reasons, the court must grant defendant’s\nmotion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6).\n\n             1.    DeKalb County’s Stormwater Utility Charge Is a Tax\n\n        It is a fundamental principle of constitutional law that the United States is\nimmune from direct taxation by state and local governments, including counties.\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819); see also Lee v. Osceola &\nLittle River Rd. Improvement Dist. No. 1 of Mississippi Cnty., Mo., 268 U.S. 643,\n620 (1925) (“It was settled many years ago that the property of the United States is\nexempt by the Constitution from taxation under the authority of a State as long as\ntitle remains in the United States.”).\n\n       The federal government’s immunity from state and local taxation is based\nupon the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2, and is therefore absolute.\nSee United States v. Delaware, 958 F.2d 555, 558 (3d Cir. 1992) (noting that the\nSupreme Court has adopted a broad reading of “the Supremacy Clause, viewing all\nstate taxes on federal entities as insults to national sovereignty and impermissible\nburdens on federal operations”); see also United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S.\n720, 733 (1982) (noting that “the Court has never questioned the propriety of\nabsolute federal immunity from state taxation”); United States v. City of Columbia,\n914 F.2d 151, 153 (8th Cir. 1990) (“Unlike the states’ immunity from federal\ntaxation, which is somewhat limited, the United States’ immunity from state\ntaxation is a ‘blanket immunity.’”) (citation omitted).\n\n       Notwithstanding the absolute prohibition on state taxation, the government\nmay be charged for services rendered or for its use of state or local property. See,\ne.g., Packet Co. v. Keokuk, 95 U.S. 80, 85-86 (1877) (holding that a charge for the\nuse of a public wharf was a user fee rather than a tax for constitutional purposes);\nCincinnati v. United States, 153 F.3d 1375, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“One issue\ncourts have had to decide is whether the assessment in question should be\ncharacterized as a tax, and thus impermissible when imposed on a federal entity, or\nwhether the assessment should be considered a fee for services provided to the\nfederal entity, and therefore permissible.”).\n\n      In short, there is no question that states cannot tax the federal government\nwithout its consent, but it is also clear that state governments may charge the\n\n                                         23\n\ffederal government a reasonable and nondiscriminatory fee for services rendered.\nHere, the court must determine whether the charges at issue in this case are most\nappropriately characterized as taxes or fees. The parties disagree on the answer\nto that question, and they cite different legal standards in reaching their divergent\nconclusions.\n\n       Before addressing the standards proposed by the parties, the court notes that\nit matters little that the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that the type of\nstormwater utility assessments at issue in this case are fees rather than taxes. See\nMcLeod v. Columbia Cnty., 599 S.E.2d 152, 154-55 (Ga. 2004). That decision\ndoes not affect the outcome here: “Where a federal right is concerned we are not\nbound by the characterization given to a state tax by state courts or Legislatures, or\nrelieved by it from the duty of considering the real nature of the tax and its effect\nupon the federal right asserted.” Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U.S. 363, 367-68 (1930).\nIndeed, the state court addressed the issue only because a federal district court had\nremanded the case after determining that the charges were taxes under federal law.\nSee McLeod v. Columbia Cnty., 254 F. Supp. 2d 1340, 1344-49 (S.D. Ga. 2003)\n(holding that a county’s stormwater management charges were taxes for purposes\nof the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341 (2006)).\n\n        For the same reason, the court is not bound by the County’s characterization\nof its charges as “stormwater service fees” in the stormwater ordinance. See\nCollins Holding Corp. v. Jasper Cnty., S.C., 123 F.3d 797, 800 n.3 (4th Cir. 1997)\n(“Whether the body imposing the assessment labels it as a tax or a fee is not\ndispositive because the label is not always consistent with the true character of the\nassessment.”) (citation omitted). Instead, in seeking to draw a line between an\nimpermissible tax and a permissible fee, the court must “consider all the facts and\ncircumstances of record in the case and assess them on the basis of the economic\nrealities to determine the essential nature of the [charge].” City of Columbia,\n914 F.2d at 154 (citation omitted).\n\n                    a.    The Massachusetts Test\n\n       The County argues that the test set forth in Massachusetts v. United States,\n435 U.S. 444 (1978), presents the most appropriate means of determining whether\nthe stormwater charges in this case are permissible fees or impermissible taxes.\nWhile the decisions of the Supreme Court are, of course, binding on this court,\nthe issues addressed in that case are not the issues now before this court, and the\n\n                                          24\n\fholding in that case does not apply here. First, the issue before the court in this\ncase is whether the County’s stormwater management charges are fees or taxes,\nwhile the issue before the Supreme Court in Massachusetts was whether a federal\ntax imposed upon state property was reasonable. Further, this case requires the\ncourt to determine whether the County’s stormwater charges are barred under the\nSupremacy Clause, while the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts was\nbased not on that clause, but on the states’ implied immunity from federal taxes.\n\n                           i.     Massachusetts Did Not Draw a Line between\n                                  Permissible Fees and Impermissible Taxes\n\n       In Massachusetts, the state argued that its implied immunity from federal\ntaxation prohibited the assessment of an annual registration tax on a state-owned\nhelicopter that was used exclusively for essential police functions. In reviewing\nthe constitutional validity of that tax, the Supreme Court created a three-part test,\nwhich provides that federal taxes imposed on a state or its property do not violate\nthat state’s implied immunity from federal taxation when: (1) the tax is imposed in\na nondiscriminatory manner; (2) the tax is a fair approximation of the benefits\nreceived by the taxed entity; and (3) the tax does not produce revenues that exceed\nthe cost of the benefits provided. Massachusetts, 435 U.S. at 467. While the tax at\nissue in Massachusetts was designed to resemble a user fee in some respects, there\nwas no dispute that the tax was in fact a tax.\n\n       Thus, the court is not faced with a choice between two competing tests for\ndetermining whether a particular charge is a fee or a tax. The Massachusetts test\ndoes not address that issue; instead, that test answers an entirely different question:\nwhen do federal taxes imposed on a state or its property unduly interfere with the\ntraditional and essential functions of the state, thereby violating that state’s implied\nimmunity from federal taxation? In other words, the Massachusetts test does not\nattempt to draw a line between fees and taxes, but instead determines whether a tax\nis reasonable.\n\n     The Massachusetts test might be useful for evaluating whether the County’s\nstormwater management charges are reasonable, but it cannot determine whether\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fthey are fees.13 In fact, Congress adopted the basic framework of that test in the\n2011 amendment to section 1323. Because the waiver contained in section 1323 is\nlimited to “reasonable service charges,” the new language in the statute ensures\nthat the government’s liability under that section is in fact limited to charges that\nare reasonable. In this case, however, the government does not contest or dispute\nthe reasonableness of the County’s stormwater charges. See Tr. at 22-23. Rather,\nthe government argues only that the charges are taxes, and that Congress did not\nwaive the government’s immunity from such taxes until January 4, 2011.\n\n                              ii.    The Supreme Court’s Holding in Massachusetts\n                                     Was Not Based on the Supremacy Clause\n\n       The Supreme Court’s analysis in Massachusetts is also inapposite because it\nwas not based upon the Supremacy Clause. In contrast to the federal government’s\nimmunity from state and local taxation, which is based on the Supremacy Clause,\nthe states’ immunity from federal taxation “was judicially implied from the States’\nrole in the constitutional scheme.” Massachusetts, 435 U.S. at 455. For that\nreason, state immunity from federal taxation is not absolute, in sharp contrast to the\nfederal government’s categorical immunity from state taxation. See City of\nColumbia, 914 F.2d at 153 (“Generally, the states are immune from federal\ntaxation that would unduly burden essential state functions. Federal immunity\nfrom state taxation, however, is a blanket immunity and is not subject to the same\nlimits.”).\n\n      The Supremacy Clause categorically prohibits state and local taxation of\nfederal property. For that reason, the test described in Massachusetts – which is\nused to determine whether federal taxes on state-owned property violate that state’s\nimplied immunity from federal taxation – cannot be applied in this case. See, e.g.,\nOneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin v. Village of Hobart, No. 10-C-137, 2012\n\n\n       13\n         / Indeed, in the case of United States v. Renton, No. C11-1156, 2012 WL 1903429\n(W.D. Wash. May 25, 2012), upon which the County and amici rely in this case, the court there\nnoted that the Massachusetts test is used to evaluate the reasonableness of a particular charge,\nnot to determine whether that charge is a tax or a fee. See id. at *7 (“[T]he factors in the\nMassachusetts test have been recognized as a test of the reasonableness of regulatory charges.”),\nn.5 (“The issue here . . . is not whether reasonable service charges for stormwater programs are\ntaxes, but the use of the Massachusetts factors in determining the reasonableness of regulatory\ncharges.”).\n\n                                               26\n\fWL 3839570, at *6 n.5 (E.D. Wis. Sept. 5, 2012) (“Federal immunity from state\ntaxation is predicated on the Supremacy Clause whereas state immunity from\nFederal taxation is implied from the states’ relationship to the national government\nwithin the constitutional scheme. The difference is significant and makes the two\nanalytically distinct. Massachusetts is accordingly inapplicable here.”)\n(emphasis and citation omitted). In sum, the Massachusetts test does not apply\nhere because it addresses a different question than the one now before this court,\nand it is based upon a different constitutional provision than the one this court must\nnow apply.14\n\n                      b.      The San Juan Cellular Test\n\n       Defendant urges this court to adopt the legal framework first established in\nSan Juan Cellular Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, 967 F.2d 683\n(1st Cir. 1992). There, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit\nexplained that a number of courts have been required to draw a line between\npermissible fees and impermissible taxes, and noted that those courts\n\n               have sketched a spectrum with a paradigmatic tax at one\n               end and a paradigmatic fee at the other. The classic “tax”\n               is imposed by a legislature upon many, or all citizens.\n               It raises money, contributed to a general fund, and spent\n               for the benefit of the entire community. The classic\n               “regulatory fee” is imposed by an agency upon those\n\n\n       14\n         / The County and amici note that the United States Court of Appeals for the First\nCircuit used the three-part Massachusetts test to evaluate the validity of a state charge imposed\non the federal government in Maine v. Department of Navy, 973 F.2d 1007 (1st Cir. 1992), and\nthus argue that the application of the test is not limited to those situations in which the federal\ngovernment has imposed a tax on a state government. In that case, however, the First Circuit did\nnot apply the test set forth in Massachusetts to determine whether the charge at issue was a fee or\na tax. Instead, the question before that court was whether the charges at issue – which the parties\nagreed were fees – were unreasonable. The First Circuit noted that the government had waived\nits immunity only with respect to reasonable service charges, and then applied the\nMassachusetts test for the purpose of evaluating the government’s contention that the licensing\nfees imposed by the state were unreasonably high. The statute at issue in Maine was the\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901-6992k (2006), which contains a\nprovision that is substantially similar to the Federal Facilities Section of the Clean Water Act.\n\n\n                                                27\n\f               subject to its regulation. It may serve regulatory\n               purposes directly by, for example, deliberately\n               discouraging particular conduct by making it more\n               expensive. Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly by,\n               for example, raising money placed in a special fund to\n               help defray the agency’s regulation-related expenses.\n\nId. at 685 (citations omitted).\n\n      Many courts have borrowed the analysis in San Juan Cellular to distinguish\npermissible fees from impermissible taxes. See, e.g., Valero Terrestrial Corp. v.\nCaffrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134-36 (4th Cir. 2000); Collins Holding, 123 F.3d at\n800-01; McLeod, 254 F. Supp. 2d at 1345-48; Oneida Tribe, 2012 WL 3839570, at\n*6-*8. Those courts have applied that analysis as a three-part inquiry that asks the\nfollowing questions. First, which governmental entity imposed the charge? Next,\nwhich parties must pay the charge? And finally, for whose benefit are the revenues\ngenerated by the charge spent?\n\n       The County and amici argue that San Juan Cellular, and many of the other\ncases that applied its analysis, are simply inapplicable here because the question in\nthose cases was whether the charge at issue was a fee or a tax for purposes of the\nTax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1341, and not whether a state charge could\nbe assessed against federal property without violating the Supremacy Clause.15\nWhile that observation is correct, the court does not find it to be particularly\nrelevant. Unlike the test in Massachusetts, which the County and amici contend is\napplicable here, the analysis in San Juan Cellular actually addresses the issue that\nis now before the court. The court finds the analysis in San Juan Cellular to be\npersuasive and holds that the use of a three-part test based on that analysis\nrepresents an appropriate approach to drawing the line between fees and taxes.\nFinally, as discussed in more detail below, the third – and most important – factor\nof the San Juan Cellular inquiry is fully consistent with the Supreme Court’s\nobservation that a government agency that provides a service “may exact a fee for\na grant which, presumably, bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other\n\n       15\n          / In San Juan Cellular, the First Circuit determined whether a regulatory charge was a\nfee or a tax under the Butler Act, 48 U.S.C. § 872 (2006), a statute designed to minimize the\ninterference of federal courts with the collection of taxes imposed under the laws of Puerto Rico,\nin the same way that the TIA minimizes such interference with respect to state and local taxes.\n\n                                                28\n\fmembers of society.” Nat’l Cable Television Ass’n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336,\n340-41 (1974). The court notes the legal context in which the San Juan Cellular\nanalysis was first developed, but nonetheless holds that it is the more appropriate\nanalytical framework for the question now before the court.\n\n                           i.     Which Entity Imposed the Charge?\n\n       First, the court must examine which governmental entity imposed the charge\nin this case. When an assessment is imposed by a legislative body, rather than an\nadministrative agency, it is more likely to be viewed as a tax than as a fee. See\nSan Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 686. Here, the stormwater charges were adopted,\nand their precise amounts were set, by the County’s board of commissioners.\nThe stormwater utility does not have the authority to revise the rates set forth in the\nordinance; instead, the specified rates may be amended only by action of the\n“governing authority” – i.e., the County’s board of commissioners and chief\nexecutive. See County Code § 25-365(b) (“The stormwater service charge per\nequivalent residential unit shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month or as amended\nby official action of the governing authority.”) (emphasis added).\n\n        Some courts have noted that “[i]f the responsibility for administering and\ncollecting the assessment lies with the general tax assessor, it is more likely to be a\ntax; if this responsibility lies with a regulatory agency, it is more likely to be a fee.”\nCollins Holding, 123 F.3d at 800. Here, the County’s stormwater charges are\nbilled to the government on an invoice from the County’s tax commissioner. See\nBooth Aff. Ex. 1. The County’s deputy tax commissioner, who is also its director\nfor delinquent collections, “oversee[s] collection of delinquent stormwater utility\nfees on behalf of DeKalb County, Georgia.” Id. ¶ 3. The stormwater utility does\nnot collect the assessments that are ultimately deposited into the enterprise fund.\nThe stormwater charges in this case were adopted and set by the County’s\nlegislative body, and they are collected by the County’s tax collector. Those facts,\nunder the first prong of the San Juan Cellular test, suggest that the stormwater\nassessments in this case are taxes rather than fees.\n\n                           ii.    Which Parties Must Pay the Charge?\n\n       Next, the court must examine which parties are subject to the assessments.\nIf the charge is imposed upon all citizens, or a broad class of them, then the charge\nis more likely to be a tax; if the charge is imposed only upon a narrow group, then\n\n                                           29\n\fthe charge is more likely to be a fee. San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d 685. Here, the\nCounty’s stormwater management charge is not assessed against a narrow group of\nresidents or businesses; instead, the assessment is levied against every single owner\nof developed property in the unincorporated portions of the county.16\n\n       The stormwater charge is assessed against every dwelling in the county, as\nwell as “commercial and office buildings, industrial and manufacturing buildings,\nstorage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots,\nparks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research\nstations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, and agricultural uses covered\nby impervious surfaces.” County Code § 25-361 (providing definitions of “single\ndwelling lot,” “multiple dwelling lot,” and “other developed land”); id. § 25-365\n(setting the charges applicable to single dwelling lots, multiple dwelling lots, and\nother developed land). The ordinance further notes that the majority of the land\nwithin the unincorporated portion of the county is in fact developed. Id.\n§ 25-360(d).\n\n       In sum, the stormwater charges that the County seeks to recover in this case\nare imposed upon every homeowner who lives in the unincorporated portion of the\ncounty and every business that is located there, as well as every other lot that is\ncovered with any impervious surface, ranging from the smallest doghouse to the\nlargest church, airport, or sports stadium. Because the County’s stormwater charge\nis not assessed against a narrow group, but is instead imposed on the majority of\nproperty in the unincorporated portions of the county, see id. § 25-360(d), the\nsecond factor of the San Juan Cellular inquiry also suggests that the charge is a\ntax.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          / The term “developed land” is defined as all property that is not “undeveloped land,”\nwhich is in turn defined as “a lot in its unaltered natural state and which has no pavement,\nasphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that\nwould prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a\nmanner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural\nstate.” County Code § 25-361. In other words, with the exception of rights of way – both public\nand railroad – developed land includes any property covered with any amount of impervious\nsurface.\n\n                                               30\n\f                          iii.   For Whose Benefit Are the Revenues Spent?\n\n       Finally, the court must examine for whose benefit the revenues generated by\nthe charge are spent. If the County spends the revenue to provide a benefit for the\ngeneral public, then the charge is more likely to be a tax, but if the revenue is spent\nto provide a particularized benefit for a narrow group, or to offset the cost of\nregulating a narrow group, then the charge is more likely to be a fee. Here, the\ncourt concludes that the stormwater management charges are used to finance\nbenefits that inure primarily to the benefit of the general public.\n\n       The First Circuit has explained that the third part of the San Juan Cellular\ninquiry is often the most important: “[c]ourts facing cases that lie near the middle\nof this spectrum have tended . . . to emphasize the revenue’s ultimate use, asking\nwhether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a\ngeneral tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or\ndefrays the agency’s costs of regulation.” San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.\n\n       The stormwater ordinance describes the purpose of the utility, noting that the\n“provision of stormwater management services and facilities in DeKalb County\npromotes an essential regulatory purpose by controlling where stormwater runoff\nflows and how it is disposed, and thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water\npollution caused by stormwater runoff.” County Code § 25-360(e). Further, the\nordinance explains that\n\n             [t]he board of commissioners is responsible for the\n             protection and preservation of the public health, safety,\n             and welfare of the community, and finds that it is in the\n             best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the\n             citizens of the county and the community at large to\n             proceed with the development, implementation, and\n             operation of a utility for stormwater management\n             accounted for in the county budget as a separate\n             enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater\n             management and to institute funding methods associated\n             therewith.\n\nId. § 360(g); see also Tr. at 36 (noting that revenue deposited in the enterprise fund\nis spent to further the purposes of drainage control and flood control), 38\n\n                                          31\n\f(explaining that the stormwater utility promotes the essential regulatory purposes\nof preventing floods, erosion, and water pollution).\n\n        The purposes of the stormwater ordinance, and of the stormwater system –\ni.e., flood prevention and the abatement of water pollution – are benefits that are\nenjoyed by the general public. For that reason, the charge is more properly viewed\nas a tax than as a fee. See San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685 (noting that the\nrevenue from a tax “is spent for the benefit of the entire community”). Those\nbenefits are public; they are not individualized services provided to particular\ncustomers.\n\n       The presence of a stormwater management system, and the imposition of\ncharges to fund that system, create reciprocal benefits and burdens for nearly all\nowners of developed property within the unincorporated areas of DeKalb County.\nWhile each property owner is burdened by payment of the charge, and enjoys no\nspecial benefit by virtue of the connection of its own property to that system, the\nproperty owner does derive a benefit from the fact that stormwater runoff from\nother properties is collected and diverted by the system. That benefit, however, is\none that is shared with nearly every other member of the community. In short,\nflood control is a public benefit, and charges to pay for that benefit are typically\nviewed as taxes. See, e.g., United States v. City of Huntington, W.V., 999 F.2d 71,\n73 (4th Cir. 1993) (explaining that because flood control and fire prevention are\nboth “core government services,” assessments to pay for those services are taxes).\n\n       The abatement of water pollution is also an important benefit of the system,\nand it is likewise a public benefit that is shared with the rest of the community.\nThe owners of developed property, who pay the stormwater management charges,\nreceive no special benefit from clean rivers, streams, and lakes that is not also\nenjoyed by the general public. Cf. Mildenberger v. United States, 91 Fed. Cl. 217,\n245-47 (2010) (noting that water pollution is a harm that is experienced not only\nby riparian landowners, but by the public as a whole), aff’d, 643 F.3d 938\n(Fed. Cir. 2011).\n\n       The stormwater system is a local infrastructure improvement that provides\nbenefits – i.e., drainage, flood protection, and water pollution abatement – not only\nto the owners of developed property who pay stormwater utility charges, but also\nto the owners of undeveloped property, who do not pay the charge, and to other\nmembers of the general public who may not own any property in the county at all.\n\n                                         32\n\fThe Supreme Court has noted that “[a]ssessments upon property for local\nimprovements are involuntary exactions, and in that respect stand on the same\nfooting with ordinary taxes.” Hagar v. Reclamation Dist. No. 108, 111 U.S. 701,\n707 (1884).\n\n      In addition to listing the generalized public benefits discussed above, the\nordinance also states that the stormwater management system provides\n\n               a specific service to property owners by assisting in the\n               property owner’s legal obligation to control stormwater\n               runoff from their property and ensure that runoff does not\n               flow upon their neighbors in greater quantities than it\n               would if the property were in an undeveloped state.\n               By mitigating the impact of stormwater runoff from\n               developed property, the stormwater management system\n               helps prevent damage that would subject a property\n               owner to civil liability.\n\nCounty Code § 25-360(f). The County argues that it is this service – the reduction\nin the risk of legal liability due to damage from stormwater runoff – that transforms\nthe assessment here into a fee rather than a tax.\n\n       The court first notes that it is not clear whether defendant would in fact be\nsubject to any liability for damage to neighboring properties due to stormwater\nrunoff from federal facilities. During oral argument, counsel for amici suggested\nthat the government might be subject to an action under the citizen-suit provision\nof the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1365 (2006), but both he and counsel for the County\nwere uncertain as to whether the government might be subject to liability for either\ntrespass or nuisance under the common law of Georgia.17 However, the court need\nnot determine the extent of the government’s liability for such damage because the\nso-called “benefit” cited by the County is problematic in a number of respects.\n\n       17\n         / The court notes that the government might be subject to suit in certain circumstances\nunder the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See, e.g., Ridge Line, Inc. v. United States,\n346 F.3d 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (evaluating whether the construction of a Postal Service facility,\nwhich dramatically increased the flow of stormwater onto a downhill property, could effect a\ntaking of a flowage easement requiring the payment of just compensation to the owner of the\naffected property).\n\n                                               33\n\f       First, the stormwater ordinance expressly provides that every property owner\nis responsible for managing the flow of stormwater runoff on its own property,\nregardless of whether those owners have remitted the stormwater charges imposed\nby the County:\n\n               [e]very owner of real property located in the\n               unincorporated area of the county, and every person who\n               serves as a contractor or developer for the purpose of\n               developing real property located in the unincorporated\n               area of DeKalb County shall provide, manage, maintain,\n               and operate on-site stormwater management systems and\n               facilities sufficient to collect, convey, detain, control and\n               discharge stormwater in a safe manner consistent with all\n               DeKalb County ordinances and development regulations,\n               and the laws of the State of Georgia and the United States\n               of America.\n\nCounty Code § 25-372. The ordinance further states that “[a]ny failure to meet this\nobligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by\nany damaged party or DeKalb County in any court of competent jurisdiction.” Id.\nIn short, payment of the charge does not appear to relieve any property owner of its\nliability for damage to neighboring properties caused by stormwater runoff.\n\n       In addition, even if payment of the stormwater charges effectively protected\nproperty owners from such liability, there is no apparent relationship between the\nvalue of the benefit and the amount of the charge. The stormwater assessment is\ngenerally based on the amount of impervious surface on the charged property.\nWhile that measurement may provide a rough approximation of the quantity of\nstormwater runoff generated by that property, it does not have any clear connection\nto the amount of damage such runoff might cause to neighboring properties and,\nconsequently, the property owner’s potential liability for such damage. Instead, the\ndamage due to stormwater runoff from a particular property will depend upon a\nnumber of other factors, such as topography, whether the surrounding properties\nare developed, and the types of improvements located on those properties.18\n\n       18\n         / This absence of proportionality might be more relevant to the reasonableness of the\ncharge, rather than whether the charge is a fee or a tax, but the court believes that the apparent\nlack of proportionality also undermines the County’s argument that “liability protection” is an\n\n                                                34\n\f        While user fees are generally based on the quantum of services that are\nprovided, the assessments in this case are not necessarily based on the benefits\nprovided to each owner of developed property. First, the stormwater charges in\nthis case are based not on the benefits derived by the payor, but by the anticipated\nburden that its property imposes on the stormwater system. However, the burden\nimposed on the system by the runoff from the property, and the benefits conferred\nupon that property by the system are not the same thing. There may be properties,\nfor example, that impose significant burdens on the stormwater system while\nderiving no substantial benefit from that system (e.g., a property with extensive\nimpervious coverage that is located on the top of a hill). Similarly, there may be\nproperties that have little impact on the stormwater system that receive substantial\nbenefits from that system (e.g., a small home on a large, otherwise undeveloped lot\nthat is located downhill from extensive development). Second, even if the benefits\nconferred on specific properties and the burdens those properties impose on the\nsystem were treated as if they were the same, the amount of the charge does not\ndepend upon the burden actually imposed on the system by a particular property.\nRegardless of how much rain falls on a property, and how much of that rain\nactually leaves the property and flows into the system, the charge remains the\nsame. See Cincinnati v. United States, 39 Fed. Cl. 271, 276 (1997) (“Under the\nsystem enacted by the City of Cincinnati, during a month of drought or a month of\nflooding, the federal government would be assessed the same amount of storm\ndrainage charges.”).\n\n       In further support of its position, the County argues that its charges should\nbe viewed as fees because they are deposited into a separate enterprise fund that\nmay be used only for costs related to the stormwater management system, rather\nthan being directed into the County’s general revenue account. See Pl.’s Resp. at\n18. The fact that the revenue generated by the stormwater management charge is\nsegregated from other revenue, and is ultimately deposited into a separate\nenterprise fund, is not a sufficient basis for determining that the charge is a fee.\nSee Valero, 205 F.3d at 135 (explaining that “[i]f the revenue of the special fund is\nused to benefit the population at large then the segregation of the revenue to a\nspecial fund is immaterial”) (citation omitted). Here, the revenue from the charge\nis used to fund a stormwater management system that benefits the public at large,\nso the fact that the revenue is segregated into a separate account is not especially\n\n\nindividualized service provided to property owners in exchange for payment of the charge.\n\n                                              35\n\frelevant.19\n\n       The court does not doubt the precarious financial situation of the County and\nother similarly situated counties and municipalities all over the country. The cost\nof operating stormwater management facilities has increased dramatically in recent\nyears, and much of that increase is attributable to new requirements imposed by the\nfederal government. Further, the tax-exempt status of federal facilities and other\nproperties that impose significant burdens on the stormwater management system\nhas severely limited the ability of local governments to fully recoup those costs.\nIn light of the difficulties – both legal and political – of raising taxes, many\ncounties and municipalities have attempted to structure their taxes as user fees to\navoid the legal restrictions that apply to the former but not to the latter.\n\n       Unfortunately, the nature of a stormwater management system, which\nbenefits the public without providing any individualized, measurable benefit to\nindividual property owners, does not lend itself to a system of funding based on\nuser fees. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted that\n“[w]hen a fee is imposed on the United States for the purpose of extracting by fee\nthat which cannot be extracted by taxation, the imposition of that fee may violate\nthe Supremacy Clause.” Novato Fire Prot. Dist. v. United States, 181 F.3d 1135,\n1139 (9th Cir. 1999) (citations omitted). The stormwater management charges at\nissue are a mechanism designed to raise revenue from the federal government and,\nof course, other property owners to cover the rapidly increasing costs of a local\nimprovement that benefits the public as a whole. See Amicus Br. at 8-9\n(explaining that “municipalities began to enact and enforce stormwater ordinances\nstarting in the 1990s, such as [impervious area charges] to cover the increasingly\nstringent costs of stormwater controls”).\n\n\n\n       19\n          / In San Juan Cellular, the First Circuit also noted that a particular charge may be an\nimpermissible tax if it is used to pay for a public benefit that is often financed with taxes.\n967 F.2d at 685. In holding that the stormwater charges assessed by another Georgia county\nwere taxes rather than fees, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\nnoted that “[s]torm water management was and is the type of service that is often funded through\ngeneral tax revenue.” McLeod, 254 F. Supp. 2d at 1348; see also Financing Stormwater\nFacilities: a Utility Approach (1991), at 1 (“Stormwater management historically has been\nfinanced with general revenues from property taxes.”), available at\nhttp://stormwaterfinance.urbancenter.iupui.edu/PDFs/APWAmanual.pdf.\n\n                                               36\n\f      In summary, the court concludes that under the San Juan Cellular test, the\nstormwater management charges assessed by the County are impermissible taxes\nthat may not be imposed on federal properties without the government’s consent.\nThe charges are set by the County’s legislative body, they are imposed on every\nowner of developed property in the unincorporated portion of the county, and they\nare used to provide benefits that are enjoyed by the public as a whole.\n\n                       c.      The Involuntary Nature of the Charge\n\n       The government argues that the charges in this case should be viewed as\ntaxes because they are involuntary, while the County asserts that its assessments\nare a fee for services rather than “an inescapable charge based solely upon the mere\nfact of property ownership.” Pl.’s Resp. at 17 n.10. In addition to finding that the\nCounty’s stormwater charges are taxes under the San Juan Cellular test, the court\nfurther concludes that the charges more closely resemble taxes due to their\ninvoluntary nature.\n\n       In National Cable, 415 U.S. at 340, the Supreme Court explained that\n“[a] fee is incident to a voluntary act.”20 In a number of other cases, the Court has\ncontrasted the voluntary nature of a fee with the mandatory nature of a tax.\nSee, e.g., United States v. LaFranca, 282 U.S. 568, 572 (1931) (explaining that\ntaxes are “enforced contribution[s] to provide for the support of government”);\nHagar, 111 U.S. at 707 (explaining that “[a]ssessments upon property for local\n\n\n       20\n          / The County argues that the standard set forth in National Cable should not be applied\nhere because that standard was based on the specific statute at issue in that case. There, the\npetitioner had challenged licensing charges imposed upon cable television companies by the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) pursuant to the Independent Offices Appropriation\nAct of 1952, 31 U.S.C. § 9701 (2006), which authorized certain agencies to impose service\ncharges based on, inter alia, the value of the services provided to the recipient. The Court held\nthat Congress had not delegated the power of taxation to the FCC, and that the power granted to\nthe agency under the statute must therefore be limited to the authority to impose fees rather than\ntaxes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower appellate court with instructions to remand the\ncase to the FCC so the agency could determine whether its proposed service charges were\nproportionate to the cost of the services that were actually provided to the regulated companies.\nThe language from National Cable upon which the court now relies, however, is contained\nwithin a general discussion of the essential differences between fees and taxes, and its\napplicability is not limited to the facts of that case. In any event, National Cable is not the only\ncase in which the Supreme Court has described fees as voluntary and taxes as compulsory.\n\n                                                 37\n\fimprovements are involuntary exactions, and in that respect stand on the same\nfooting with ordinary taxes”).\n\n        Fees generally fall into two broad categories: user fees, which a government\nmay charge in exchange for services or the use of government-owned property, and\nregulatory fees, which are charges that are imposed by a regulatory agency to\nrecoup its costs of regulation. In both cases, the payment of the fee is voluntary.\nWith a user fee, one can avoid the charge by not accepting the government’s\nservices or by not using the government’s property. With a regulatory fee, one can\navoid the charge by not engaging in the regulated activity. See City of Columbia,\n914 F.2d at 156 (“When the United States purchases water, electricity, and related\nservices, and then pays the utility bill, it does so as a vendee pursuant to its\nvoluntary, contractual relationship with the City. The City imposes the charge not\nin its capacity as a sovereign, but as a vendor of goods and services.”).\n\n       Here, those subject to the stormwater utility charge have no choice but to\npay that charge. The government never requested stormwater management\nservices from the County, and it cannot simply decline to use those services.\nInstead, the government’s liability arises solely from its status as the owner of\ndeveloped property located within the unincorporated part of the county. See id. at\n155 (noting that “[t]he United States’ obligation to pay [a user fee] arises only from\nits consensual purchase of the City’s property; it does not arise automatically, as\ndoes tax liability, from the United States’ status as a property owner”). The\nFederal Circuit has held that a stormwater management charge that is based solely\non the mere ownership of property is involuntary. See Cincinnati, 153 F.3d at\n1377-78. There, the court explained that a charge applicable to all owners of\ndeveloped property and based on the amount of runoff the property was expected\nto generate was not a voluntary purchase of services:\n\n             The storm drainage service charge was not imposed as a\n             result of a consensual arrangement between the city and\n             the United States, as would be true in the case of a\n             voluntary purchase of utilities or other services. Instead,\n             the stormwater drainage service charge was an\n             assessment imposed on the United States involuntarily,\n             by virtue of its status as a property owner. While the\n             United States may be said to be a beneficiary of the storm\n             drainage services provided by the city, it was not offered\n\n                                         38\n\f               the opportunity to choose whether to accept those\n               benefits, and it cannot be said to have taken any action\n               (other than not moving out of Cincinnati when the\n               charges were assessed) to indicate its willingness to pay\n               the charges.\n\nId. The Federal Circuit concluded that the involuntary nature of the stormwater\ncharge defeated the city’s assertion of an implied-in-fact contract for services.21\n\n       In addition, the County cannot realistically terminate service to any property\ndue to the nonpayment of stormwater charges. During oral argument, when the\ncourt asked counsel for the County whether it was physically possible to deny any\nparticular property owner the benefits of the stormwater management system, he\nresponded that the County could “plug up the drainage system with concrete.”22\nTr. at 94. However, the County has a legal obligation to operate its stormwater\nmanagement system in accordance with the requirements set forth in its NPDES\npermit, and disabling portions of that system would be an abdication of its legal\n\n\n       21\n         / The Federal Circuit expressly declined to address whether the stormwater charge in\nthat case was a fee or a tax, Cincinnati, 153 F.3d at 1378, and noted that the involuntary nature\nof a charge, without more, is not necessarily sufficient to transform the charge into a tax:\n\n               The involuntary nature of the charge, however, is not dispositive.\n               There may be some instances in which a municipal assessment is\n               involuntarily imposed but would nonetheless be considered a\n               permissible fee for services rather than an impermissible tax.\n\nId. Here, the court’s determination that the County’s stormwater management charges are taxes\nis not based solely on the involuntary nature of those charges. Rather, the compulsory nature of\nthe charge is just one consideration in addition to the court’s determination that the assessment is\na tax under the San Juan Cellular test.\n       22\n           / The court did not understand counsel’s response to be a serious answer to the court’s\nquestion. If the County were to physically obstruct the storm drains closest to the government’s\nfacilities, runoff from those facilities would almost certainly find its way into the stormwater\nmanagement system somewhere else, while possibly causing damage to other nearby properties.\nWith the exception of some fanciful approaches, such as acquiring land around the perimeter of\nthe federal properties to construct levies that completely prevent stormwater runoff from leaving\nthose properties, there does not appear to be any physical means of denying any particular\nproperty owner the benefits of the stormwater management system.\n\n                                                39\n\fresponsibility to manage the stormwater within its service area, including runoff\nthat originates on federal properties.\n\n       If it were possible to deny any particular property owner the benefits of the\nstormwater management system, one would expect the ordinance to provide for the\ntermination of services due to nonpayment. Instead, the ordinance provides that\n“[u]npaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an\nunpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any\njudgment obtained thereby.” County Code § 25-371(a). Because the default\nmethod of addressing nonpayment is litigation, rather than termination of service,\nthe stormwater management charges at issue in this case yet again appear to be\ntaxes rather than fees. See City of Columbia, 914 F.2d at 155 (noting that “while\nfailure to pay a tax results in civil and sometimes criminal penalties, the failure to\npay a portion of a utility rate results in termination of services”).\n\n       Finally, the County argues that its stormwater management charges are\nvoluntary because property owners may receive credits against the charges for\nadopting specified stormwater management systems on their own property, and\nmay even receive a complete exemption from the charges if they manage 100\npercent of the rainfall on their property on their own land. The court does not\nbelieve that the availability of such credits and exemptions alters the nature of the\ncharge – it is still a tax, regardless of whether some of those subject to the tax may\nreceive a partial or even total exemption by constructing and operating costly\nstormwater management facilities on their own property. In addition, the credits –\nin contrast to the full exemption – may amount to no more forty percent of the\nassessed charge, so that property owners who manage ninety-nine percent of their\nstormwater on-site will still be subject to sixty percent of the normal assessment.\nSee County Code § 25-369(a). Finally, as the government has noted, the Internal\nRevenue Code, Title 26 of the United States Code (2006), provides a number of\ncredits and exemptions from tax liability, but those credits and exemptions do not\ntransform federal taxes into fees.\n\n             2.     Section 1323(a), prior to the 2011 Amendment, Did Not\n                    Waive the Federal Government’s Sovereign Immunity\n                    from State or Local Taxation\n\n       The County and amici argue that the language of section 1323 – even before\nit was amended in 2011 – represents an unequivocal waiver of the government’s\n\n                                          40\n\fimmunity from the type of stormwater management charges at issue in this case.\nThe government concedes that section 1323, as amended in 2011, subjects it to\nprospective liability for stormwater management charges, whether characterized as\nfees or taxes, but argues that the 1977 version of that section did not contain an\nunambiguous waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity from state or local\ntaxes. The court agrees with the government.\n\n      For the reasons discussed by the court above, “it is well settled that, absent\nexpress congressional authorization, a State cannot tax the United States directly.”\nCotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.S. 163, 175 (1989). To waive the\ngovernment’s sovereign immunity, Congress must express its intent to do so in\nterms that are unequivocal and unambiguous. See F.A.A. v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct.\n1441, 1448 (2012) (“We have said on many occasions that a waiver of sovereign\nimmunity must be ‘unequivocally expressed’ in statutory text.”) (citation omitted).\nFor that reason, “[a]ny ambiguities in the statutory language are to be construed in\nfavor of immunity, so that the Government’s consent to be sued is never enlarged\nbeyond what a fair reading of the text requires.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n        In addition, “[a] statute’s legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does\nnot appear clearly in any statutory text.” Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996);\nsee also Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448 (“Legislative history cannot supply a waiver\nthat is not clearly evident from the language of the statute.”) (citation omitted).\nThe standards applicable to a waiver of sovereign immunity are not lowered simply\nbecause section 1323 purports to place the federal government on the same footing\nas private parties. Instead, “statutes placing the United States in the same position\nas a private party [must be] read narrowly to preserve certain immunities that the\nUnited States has enjoyed historically.” Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S.\n310, 320 (1986).\n\n       There is no question that section 1323(a) waives the federal government’s\nimmunity from “reasonable service charges,” but the scope of that waiver is far\nfrom clear. First, the term is not defined in the statute, and dictionary definitions\ndo not support the County’s arguments here. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1491\n(9th ed. 2009) (defining a “service charge” as “[a] charge assessed for performing a\nservice, such as the charge assessed by a bank against the expenses of maintaining\nor servicing a customer’s checking account”). The definition of “service charge”\nmore closely corresponds with the definition of a fee, see id. at 690 (a “charge for\nlabor or services”), than with the definition of a tax, see id. at 1594 (a “charge, usu.\n\n                                          41\n\fmonetary, imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions, or\nproperty to yield public revenue”).\n\n        Second, the more circumscribed reading of the 1977 version of section 1323\n– i.e., that the term “reasonable service charges” includes fees but not taxes – is\nalso supported by the term that Congress actually used: reasonable service\ncharges. The Federal Facilities Section does not waive the government’s immunity\nfrom all “reasonable charges,” which might provide a somewhat more plausible\nbasis for concluding that the term includes taxes in addition to fees. Instead, the\nterm is qualified, and suggests that Congress intended to limit its waiver to fees\nthat were imposed in connection with the provision of a service. See id. at 1491\n(defining the term “service” as “[t]he act of doing something useful for a person or\na company, usu. for a fee”) (emphasis added).\n\n       The Supreme Court has explained that a statute purporting to waive the\ngovernment’s immunity is ambiguous “if there is a plausible interpretation of the\nstatute that would not authorize money damages against the Government.”\nCooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448. Here, there is at least one plausible interpretation of\nsection 1323 that would not authorize the damages the County seeks in this case:\nthat section 1323 waives the government’s immunity from fees but not from taxes.\nSection 1323, as it existed before January 2011, could be interpreted to waive the\ngovernment’s immunity from both regulatory fees, such as the fees charged to\nprocess a permit application, and user fees, such as fees charged for the provision\nof water or the disposal and treatment of sanitary sewage. On the other hand,\nsection 1323 need not be read to waive the government’s sovereign immunity from\nstate or local taxes, such as the stormwater management charges at issue in this\ncase. When faced with two plausible readings of a waiver of sovereign immunity,\none broad in scope and one narrow, the court must interpret the statute narrowly.\nLumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. United States, 654 F.3d 1305, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2011)\n(noting that any waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed\nin statutory text and will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\nsovereign”) (citation and internal quotations omitted).\n\n       In sum, the version of section 1323 that existed prior to January 4, 2011 did\nnot contain an unambiguous waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity from\nstate or local taxes. In fact, amici appear to concede that the 1977 version of the\nstatute is not amenable to a broader construction. See Tr. at 65-66 (“I don’t think\nyou can read [the 1977 version of section 1323] to say that Congress waived\n\n                                           42\n\f[sovereign immunity] for something that would meet the test of a tax.”). In any\ncase, the County and amici argue that Congress passed the 2011 amendment to\nclarify the intended meaning of section 1323. For that reason, the County and\namici contend that section 1323 must be read as if it had always been so clarified.\n\n             3.     Section 1323(c) Cannot Be Treated as a Clarification of an\n                    Earlier Waiver of the Government’s Sovereign Immunity if\n                    Doing So Would Expand the Scope of the Original Waiver\n\n        In their brief to the court, amici assert that the 2011 amendment was nothing\nmore than a clarification of an earlier waiver of sovereign immunity contained in\nthe 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act. In support of that argument, amici\ncite the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in\nPiamba Cortes v. American Airlines, Inc., 177 F.3d 1272 (11th Cir. 1999). There,\nthe court held that an amendment will be viewed as a clarification of an earlier\nstatute when: (1) the language of the earlier statute was ambiguous and in need of\nclarification; and (2) Congress has declared its intent to clarify the earlier statute.\nId. at 1283-84. In their brief, amici also reference the Ninth Circuit’s decision in\nUnited States v. Sanders, 67 F.3d 855, 856 (9th Cir. 1995), which explained that\n“when an amendment is a clarification, rather than an alteration, of existing law,\nthen it should be used in interpreting the provision in question retroactively.”\nIn its reply in support of its motion for summary judgment, the County adopts the\nclarification argument advanced by amici. Unfortunately for the County, the\nstandard set forth in Piamba Cortes is fundamentally inconsistent with the\nstandards for a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n       In normal circumstances, when a waiver of sovereign immunity is not\ninvolved, a court can discern the meaning of ambiguous statutory language by\nreference to extrinsic evidence of congressional intent. However, such evidence is\ngenerally limited to legislative history that preceded the enactment of the statute.\nSee, e.g., Ogilvie v. United States, 519 U.S. 79, 90 (1996) (noting that “the view of\na later Congress cannot control the interpretation of an earlier enacted statute”);\nUnited States v. Prince, 361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960) (“[T]he views of a subsequent\nCongress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.”).\nPiamba Cortes provides an exception to that general rule of statutory construction,\nallowing a court to treat an amendment to an ambiguous statute as a “clarification”\nof that statute, and to interpret the statute as if it had always been so clarified –\nessentially giving the amendment retroactive effect.\n\n                                          43\n\f       While there is no requirement that statutes be applied only prospectively,\nthere is a strong presumption against retroactive application: “The presumption\nagainst retroactive application is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence and embodies\na legal doctrine centuries older than our Republic.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,\n511 U.S. 244, 265 (1994). When a statute effects a substantive change in the law,\nit cannot be applied retroactively unless Congress has expressly indicated its intent\nthat the statute be given retroactive effect. See Travenol Labs. v. United States,\n118 F.3d 749, 752 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (noting that “retroactivity in general is not\nfavored in the law and, accordingly, legislation will be applied only prospectively\nunless Congress has clearly expressed a contrary intention”). In Piamba Cortes,\nhowever, the Eleventh Circuit explained that the usual concerns about retroactive\napplication of a statutory amendment are not implicated when the amendment\nmerely clarifies prior law rather than effecting a substantive change in the law.\n177 F.3d at 1283. For that reason, an amendment that does nothing more than\nclarify existing law may be given retroactive effect even in the absence of a clear\nstatement from Congress indicating that the amendment is to be applied\nretroactively.\n\n       In contrast to most statutes, however, a waiver of sovereign immunity must\nbe expressed in clear and unambiguous terms, and any ambiguities contained in the\nstatute must be resolved in favor of immunity. See Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448.\nFurther, a court may not examine legislative history or any other type of extrinsic\nevidence of congressional intent in interpreting the scope of the waiver. See id.\nRather, any waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed in\nstatutory text and will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\nsovereign.” Lumbermens, 654 F.3d at 1311 (emphasis added). For that reason, it\ndoes not appear that Congress could ever clarify the scope of an earlier waiver of\nsovereign immunity under Piamba Cortes because a statute may be clarified only if\nit is ambiguous, while a statute can effect a waiver of sovereign immunity only if it\nis unambiguous. Here, the court has already determined that the 1977 version of\nsection 1323 did not contain a clear, unambiguous waiver of the government’s\nsovereign immunity from taxes. Because the earlier version of section 1323 was\nambiguous with respect to whether it waived the government’s immunity from\ntaxes, there was no effective waiver from taxes in 1977 that could have been later\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\fclarified in 2011.23\n\n       The court disagrees with the contrary conclusion of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington in United States v. Renton,\nNo. C11-1156, 2012 WL 1903429 (W.D. Wash. May 25, 2012). In that case, the\ndistrict court concluded that the government was liable to two municipalities for\nstormwater charges assessed against federal property in years prior to the adoption\nof the 2011 amendment to section 1323. The district court first held that the 1977\nversion of that section contained an unambiguous waiver of the government’s\nimmunity from “reasonable service charges.” Next, the court determined, based\nlargely on legislative history, that the 2011 amendment was not a new waiver of\nsovereign immunity, but was instead a mere clarification of the earlier version of\nsection 1323. Finally, because it held that the 2011 amendment clarified the earlier\nversion of the statute, the court concluded that traditional canons of statutory\nconstruction required the amendment to be given retroactive effect. There are at\nleast two problems with the district court’s analysis.\n\n       First, while the district court properly held that the 1977 version of section\n1323 contained an unambiguous waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity\nfrom “reasonable service charges,” it failed to appreciate that the scope of the\ndisputed term was, in fact, ambiguous. As discussed above, there are at least two\nplausible interpretations of the term “reasonable service charges”: first, that the\nterm encompasses both fees and taxes, and, in the alternative, that the term is\nlimited to fees alone. Because ambiguities must be resolved in favor of immunity,\nthe district court should have concluded that the 1977 version of section 1323,\nprior to its amendment in 2011, did not waive the government’s sovereign\nimmunity from state and local taxation. Instead, the district court adopted the more\nexpansive interpretation of section 1323 and, based on that faulty premise, held\nthat the 2011 amendment was nothing more than a clarification of a pre-existing\nwaiver of immunity from taxes. See Lumbermens, 654 F.3d at 1311 (explaining\n\n\n       23\n         / In effect, the County is caught in a catch-22 of sorts, caused by the incompatibility of\nthe Piamba Cortes test with the exceedingly high and rigid standards that are applied to any\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The court cannot view the 2011 amendment as a clarification\nwith retroactive effect unless the 1977 version of section 1323 was ambiguous in its scope.\nHowever, if the earlier version of section 1323 was in fact ambiguous, then the 2011 amendment\ncannot have retroactive effect because Congress did not waive the government’s immunity from\ntaxes by using clear and unambiguous language in 1977.\n\n                                                45\n\fthat a waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed in statutory\ntext and will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign”)\n(citation and quotations omitted).\n\n       Finally, because it determined that the 2011 amendment was a clarification\nof an existing waiver, rather than a new waiver of immunity, the district court\nplaced extensive weight on the legislative history of that amendment. However, as\nnoted above, the 1977 version of section 1323 did not contain an unambiguous\nwaiver of immunity from state and local taxes, so the 2011 amendment must be\ninterpreted as a new waiver of sovereign immunity, the limitations of which were\nto be determined solely with reference to its express language. For that reason, the\ndistrict court was not permitted to turn to the legislative history of the 2011\namendment in discerning its meaning. See Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448\n(“Legislative history cannot supply a waiver that is not clearly evident from the\nlanguage of the statute.”); Lane, 518 U.S. at 192 (“A statute’s legislative history\ncannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text.”).\n\n       In summary, because the 1977 version of section 1323 did not clearly waive\nthe government’s immunity from state or local taxes, the 2011 amendment to that\nsection must be treated as a new waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity.\nThe amendment cannot be treated as a clarification of an earlier waiver because\nsuch treatment would expand the waiver beyond the unambiguous language of\nsection 1323 as it existed before the date of the amendment. This court cannot\napply the new waiver contained in the 2011 amendment retroactively unless\nCongress expressly stated its intent to give the amendment retroactive effect.\nNeither the County nor amici argue that the amendment contains a new waiver of\nimmunity that Congress intended to have retroactive effect, and the court does not\ndiscern any such intent in either the text or the history of the 2011 amendment.24\n\n       24\n          / The County and amici do not argue that the amendment contained a new waiver of\nsovereign immunity that Congress intended to have retroactive effect. See Pl.’s Resp. at 19 n.11\n(stating that “[t]his Court need not apply the Stormwater Amendment retroactively in order to\nfind in favor of DeKalb County”); Amicus Br. at 14 n.21 (noting that “this is not a case\ninvolving the retroactivity of [the 2011 amendment]”). Unless Congress uses clear terms to\nexpress its intent that a statute be applied retroactively, the statute will not be given such effect.\nSee Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 237 (1995) (noting that “statutes do not apply\nretroactively unless Congress expressly states that they do”) (emphasis in original). There is no\nlanguage in the 2011 amendment expressly indicating that Congress had intended it to apply\nretroactively, nor is such an intent visible in the legislative history of the amendment. Instead,\n\n                                                  46\n\fBecause the 2011 amendment cannot be applied retroactively, the County may not\nrecover the stormwater charges it seeks to collect in this case.\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       The County’s claims related to stormwater management charges assessed in\nthe first half of 2005 accrued more than six years before this suit was filed and\nmust be dismissed as untimely. The remaining claims seek to recover local taxes\nthat were assessed against the federal government before Congress waived the\ngovernment’s immunity from such taxes; those claims must be dismissed for\nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because the County’s\nclaims must be dismissed, the court cannot grant its motion for summary judgment\non those claims. In accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n\n               (1)    Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, filed February 27, 2012, is\n                      GRANTED;\n\n               (2)    Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed\n                      April 30, 2012, is DENIED;\n\n               (3)    The Clerk’s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment in\n                      favor of defendant, DISMISSING the complaint as follows:\n\n                      (a)     The claims related to stormwater utility charges billed to\n                              defendant before November 14, 2005, shall be dismissed\n                              under RCFC 12(b)(1), without prejudice; and\n\n                      (b)     The remaining claims in the complaint shall be dismissed\n                              under RCFC 12(b)(6), with prejudice.\n\n               (4)    No costs.\n\n\n\n\nthe amendment simply states that federal agencies are responsible for stormwater charges under\nsection 1323, without regard to whether they are called fees or taxes. For that reason, the court\nmay not apply the 2011 amendment retroactively to permit the County to recover the charges it\nseeks to collect in this case.\n\n                                                47\n\f     /s/Lynn J.

Because the court concludes that\nsome of the claims set forth in the complaint were filed more than six years after\nthey first accrued, defendant’s motion to dismiss those claims under Rule 12(b)(1)\nof the Rules of the United States Court of Federal Claims (RCFC) must be granted.\nThe court further holds that the remainder of the claims set forth in the complaint\nfail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and must be dismissed under\nRCFC 12(b)(6). Accordingly, defendant’s motion to dismiss is granted, and\nDeKalb County’s motion for summary judgment is denied.\n\n                                     BACKGROUND1\n\nI.     Factual History\n\n       A.     The DeKalb County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System\n\n       Most of the rain that falls on undeveloped land is absorbed into the ground.\nBut when land is developed, and the property is covered with impervious surfaces\nsuch as buildings, parking lots, sidewalks, and roads, rainfall cannot be absorbed\nand flows onto adjacent land in higher volumes and at higher velocities than if the\nland had remained in an undeveloped state. This additional runoff increases the\nrisk of flooding for nearby properties and also contributes to water pollution\nbecause the stormwater collects debris, chemicals, and other materials on the\npavement and other impervious surfaces as it travels towards natural waterways.\nStormwater runoff from impervious surfaces also impairs water quality through\nerosion and sedimentation.\n\n       In response to the increased stormwater runoff attributable to development,\nlocal governments have constructed and operated stormwater management systems\nfor many years. The cost of operating such systems has increased dramatically in\nrecent years, due to the accelerated pace of development and new requirements,\nespecially requirements related to the abatement of water pollution, imposed by\nboth state and federal law. While drainage and flood prevention were the primary\n\n\n       1\n       / The facts recounted here are taken from the parties’ submissions in this case and are\nundisputed. Unless otherwise noted, the court makes no findings of fact in this opinion.\n\n                                               2\n\fimpetus for the development of stormwater management systems, environmental\nprotection has become an increasingly important – perhaps the primary –\nconsideration in the design and management of such systems.\n\n       The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, Pub. L. No.\n92-500, 86 Stat. 816, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA),\ncreated the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which\nrequires a permit from either the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), or an\nEPA-approved state agency, in order to discharge any type of pollutant from a\npoint source into the waters of the United States. See 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311(a), 1342\n(2006). In enacting the CWA, Congress declared that the statute’s purpose was\n“to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the\nNation’s waters.” 86 Stat. 816. Further, “it [was] the policy of the Congress to\nrecognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of States to\nprevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.” Id.\n\n       In general, municipal separate storm sewer systems divert and collect\nstormwater and then discharge that water, untreated, into natural waterways.\nBecause those systems discharge pollutants into the waters of the United States,\nthey are treated as point sources under the CWA, as amended, and are required to\nobtain an NPDES permit, which imposes stringent requirements on their design\nand operation.2 See 33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B) (stating that NPDES permits for\nmunicipal storm sewers must prohibit the discharge of anything other than\nstormwater into the system and “shall require controls to reduce the discharge of\npollutants to the maximum extent practicable, including management practices,\ncontrol techniques and system, design and engineering methods, and such other\nprovisions as the Administrator or the state determines appropriate for the control\nof such pollutants”).\n\n      DeKalb County, Georgia (the County), a political subdivision of the State of\nGeorgia, owns and operates the DeKalb County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer\nSystem (the stormwater management system), which was developed over many\n\n       2\n        / There was no NPDES permit requirement for stormwater discharges until Congress\npassed the Water Quality Act of 1987, Pub.

Reg. 47,990 (Nov. 16, 1990) (codified at 40 C.F.R. pts. 122-124).\n\n                                              3\n\fyears.3 Code of DeKalb County (County Code) § 25-360(c). The system is\noperated in accordance with an NPDES permit issued by the State of Georgia and\nis also subject to additional requirements under state law. See Compl. ¶ 13; Pl.’s\nResp. at 1-2.\n\n        In December 2003, the County’s board of commissioners adopted a new\nstormwater management ordinance, which created a new stormwater utility that\nwould be “responsible for stormwater management throughout the county’s\njurisdictional limits, and [would] provide for the management, protection, control,\nregulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater systems and facilities.” County\nCode § 25-362(a). The board of commissioners transferred to the new stormwater\nutility “operational control over the existing stormwater management systems and\nfacilities owned and heretofore operated by the county and other related assets,\nincluding but not limited to properties upon which such facilities are located,\neasements, rights-of-entry and access, and certain equipment.” Id. § 25-362(b).\nMost relevant to this case, the stormwater ordinance established a new system of\n“stormwater service fees” to fund the operations of the new utility. Id. § 25-365.\n\n        Under the ordinance, the owners of all developed property located within the\nunincorporated portions of the county are required to pay an annual assessment\nthat is generally based on the impervious surface area located on the property.4\nThe charge assessed on developed properties is equal to $4.00 per month for each\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         / The County is authorized to establish a stormwater management system under the\nHome Rule section of the Georgia Constitution. See Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, sec. 2, par. III\n(a)(6) (stating that counties may provide “[s]torm water and sewage collection and disposal\nsystems”). Under state statute, the County is authorized to “prescribe, revise, and collect rates,\nfees, tolls, or charges” for systems, plants, works, instrumentalities, and properties “used or\nuseful in connection with the collection, treatment, and disposal of sewage, waste, and storm\nwater.” Ga. Code Ann. §§ 36-82-61(4)(C)(ii), 36-82-62(a)(3) (West 2012).\n       4\n         / The ordinance applies only to the unincorporated portions of DeKalb County because\nthe County cannot exercise its authority within the boundaries of incorporated municipalities that\nare located inside of its borders. See Ga. Const. 1983, Art. IX, sec. 2, par. III(b)(1) (“No county\nmay exercise any of the powers listed in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph or provide any\nservice listed therein inside the boundaries of any municipality or any other county except by\ncontract with the municipality or county affected[.]”).\n\n                                                 4\n\fEquivalent Residential Unit (ERU).5 Id. § 25-365(b). Single-family dwellings are\nassessed the rate applicable to one ERU; multiple-family dwellings are assessed the\nrate applicable to one ERU, multiplied by the number of dwelling units on the\nproperty, multiplied by an adjustment factor of 0.5; and all other developed\nproperties are assessed the rate applicable to one ERU for every 3000 square feet\nof impervious surface area on the property, rounded up to the next highest tenth of\nan ERU. Id. § 25-365(c)-(e).\n\n      The stormwater management charges do not apply to undeveloped land,\npublic rights of way, railroad rights of way, or “[a]ny property whereby one\nhundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained on the premises and\nno runoff enters into the stormwater management system.” Id. § 25-368. Further,\nproperty owners may apply for credits against the stormwater assessment by\nimplementing specified systems and facilities on their own property, but the credits\nmay amount to no more than forty percent of the total charge. Id. § 25-369(a).\n\n        The ordinance provides that the revenue generated by the new assessments\nmust be deposited into an “enterprise fund,” which is to be used only for costs\nincurred in connection with the stormwater management system. County Code\n§ 25-364. Under the ordinance, the County may appropriate additional funds for\nthe system, but the revenue in the enterprise fund may not be devoted to any other\npurpose. While revenue that is deposited into the enterprise fund may be pledged\n“to the payment of principal of premium, if any, and interest on any revenue bonds\nor other obligations lawfully issued or otherwise contracted for by the county as\nmay be provided in any resolution authorizing such bonds or obligations or in any\ntrust instrument relating to such bonds or obligations[,]” id. § 25-364(c), the\nreferenced bonds are limited to those related solely to the stormwater management\nsystem, see Tr. at 35-36.\n\n       The ordinance provides that the “stormwater service fee shall accrue\nbeginning January 1, 2004, and shall be billed annually thereafter.” Id. § 25-366.\nThe charge may be billed separately or collected “with other fees for services, . . .\nprovided that in no instance shall the service charge constitute a direct lien against\nthe property.” Id. § 25-371(a). The County may send the bill for the assessment\n\n       5\n          / The ERU was calculated based on the county’s median impervious coverage for a\nstatistical sampling of lots improved with detached, single-family dwellings. See County Code\n§ 25-361 (definition of “Equivalent Residential Unit”).\n\n                                               5\n\fthrough the mail or by other means, and that bill must indicate “the amount of the\nbill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due.” Id. § 25-371(b).\n\n       In practice, the County often includes the amount of the stormwater charge\ndue for each property owner as a line item on the annual bill sent during the\nsummer for fees and ad valorem taxes. Affidavit of John G. Booth (Booth Aff.)\n¶ 6. The United States and other tax-exempt property owners, in contrast, are\nbilled for the assessment on a separate “Stormwater Utility Notice.” Id. The\nCounty assesses these charges against its own property, and also pays stormwater\nmanagement charges imposed by municipalities and other counties in which it\nowns property. See Affidavit of Joel Gottlieb ¶¶ 3-5.\n\n       B.      The Federal Facilities Section of the Clean Water Act\n\n       Since its original enactment in 1972, the CWA has included a provision\nknown as the Federal Facilities Section, 33 U.S.C. § 1323 (2006), which requires\nthe federal government to meet the same water pollution abatement requirements\nas those applicable to private entities.6 In this case, the County argues that the\nFederal Facilities Section, which was amended in 1977 and again in 2011, waives\nthe federal government’s sovereign immunity from the stormwater utility charges\nthat plaintiff seeks to recover in this case. Because the Federal Facilities Section is\ncentral to the County’s case, the court will examine its history in some detail.\n\n               1.      The 1972 Version\n\n      In the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, the\nrelevant portion of the Federal Facilities Section read as follows:\n\n               Each department, agency, or instrumentality of the\n               executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\n               Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any\n               property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity\n\n       6\n         / The various sections of the CWA are often referred to as they appeared in the law\nenacted by Congress, rather than as they were ultimately codified in the United States Code.\nThe Federal Facilities Section, for example, is sometimes referred to as section 313 of the CWA,\neven though it is codified at 33 U.S.C. § 1323. In this opinion, the court will refer to that section\nas it was codified (i.e., as “section 1323”).\n\n                                                  6\n\f             resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff\n             of pollutants shall comply with Federal, State, interstate,\n             and local requirements respecting control and abatement\n             of pollution to the same extent that any person is subject\n             to such requirements, including the payment of\n             reasonable service charges.\n\nPub. L. No. 92-500, 86 Stat. 816, 875.\n\n      The Senate Report on the 1972 CWA states that the purpose of section 1323\nwas to “require[] that Federal facilities meet the same effluent limitations as private\nsources of pollution, unless the Federal facility is specifically exempted by the\nPresident.” S. Rep. No. 92-414, at 67, reprinted in 1971 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3668, 3733.\nThere is no discussion in either the text of the statute or in the Senate Report as to\nwhat types of charges the term “reasonable service charges” was intended to\nencompass.\n\n             2.     The 1977 Version\n\n       In EPA v. California EPA ex rel. State Water Resources Control Board,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109468\"><a href=\"/opinion/109468/epa-v-california-ex-rel-state-water-resources-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), the Supreme Court held that the Federal Facilities Section of\nthe CWA did not require federal agencies to meet state permitting requirements\nrelated to the abatement of water pollution. The Supreme Court first explained that\nfederal properties “are subject to state regulation only when and to the extent that\ncongressional authorization is clear and unambiguous.” Id. at 211. Next, the Court\nheld that section 1323 did not expressly require federal agencies to obtain an\nNPDES permit from the state to discharge effluents into navigable waters. Finally,\naccording to the Court, none of the express terms of section 1323 – including the\nrequirement that the federal government pay reasonable service charges – could be\nread to contain an implied requirement to obtain such a permit.\n\n       Congress amended section 1323 in 1977, noting in the Senate Report on the\namendment that “[t]he act has been amended to indicate unequivocally that all\nFederal facilities and activities are subject to all of the provisions of State and local\npollution laws.” S. Rep. No. 95-370, at 67 (1977), reprinted in 1977 U.S.C.C.A.N.\n4326, 4392. The report explains that “the Supreme Court, encouraged by Federal\nagencies, ha[d] misconstrued the original intent [of the 1972 law].” Id. The report\nfurther notes that because\n\n                                            7\n\f             the substantive requirements of the act and of State and\n             local law would be unenforceable unless procedural\n             provisions were also met[,] section 313 is amended to\n             specify that, as in the case of air pollution, a Federal\n             facility is subject to any Federal, State, and local\n             requirement respecting the control or abatement of water\n             pollution, both substantive and procedural, to the same\n             extent as any person is subject to these requirements.\n             This includes, but is not limited to, requirements to\n             obtain operating and construction permits, reporting and\n             monitoring requirements, any provisions for injunctive\n             relief and such sanctions imposed by a court to enforce\n             such relief, and the payment of reasonable service\n             charges.\n\nId. at 4392-93. Section 1323, as amended in 1977 and as it still reads today, states\nthat\n\n             [e]ach department, agency, or instrumentality of the\n             executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the\n             Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any\n             property or facility, or (2) engaged in any activity\n             resulting, or which may result, in the discharge or runoff\n             of pollutants, and each officer, agent, or employee\n             thereof in the performance of his official duties, shall be\n             subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate,\n             and local requirements, administrative authority, and\n             process and sanctions respecting the control and\n             abatement of water pollution in the same manner, and to\n             the same extent as any nongovernmental entity including\n             the payment of reasonable service charges.\n\n33 U.S.C. § 1323(a) (emphasis added to indicate changes made by amendment).\nThe amended section also states that its mandate applies “to any requirement,\nwhether substantive or procedural,” “to the exercise of any Federal, State, or local\nadministrative authority,” and “to any process and sanction, whether enforced in\nFederal, state, or local courts or in any other matter.” Id. Finally, the 1977 version\nof section 1323 states that “[t]his subsection shall apply notwithstanding any\n\n                                          8\n\fimmunity of such agencies, officers, agents, or employees under any law or rule of\nlaw.” Id.\n\n             3.    The 2011 Version\n\n       Despite the 1977 amendment to the Federal Facilities Section of the CWA,\nthe federal government routinely refused to pay the types of stormwater charges at\nissue in this case, arguing that such charges were taxes rather than fees, and did not\nfall within the waiver of immunity contained in section 1323(a). In response,\nSenator Ben Cardin introduced a bill to add two new subsections to section 1323,\nwithout changing the text of section 1323(a):\n\n             (c)   Federal Responsibility for Stormwater Pollution.\n                   Reasonable service charges described in subsection\n                   (a) include reasonable fees or assessments made\n                   for the purpose of stormwater management in the\n                   same manner and to the same extent as any\n                   nongovernmental entity.\n\n             (d)   No Treatment as Tax or Levy. A fee or assessment\n                   described in this section –\n\n                   (1)    shall not be considered to be a tax or other\n                          levy subject to an assertion of sovereign\n                          immunity; and\n\n                   (2)    may be paid using appropriated funds.\n\nS. 3481, 111th Cong. (2010) (as introduced), 156 Cong. Rec. S4851, S4856.\n\n        In introducing his proposed amendment to the Federal Facilities Section,\nSenator Cardin noted the government’s persistent refusal to pay reasonable\nstormwater management charges, and explained that “[a]dopting the legislation\nthat I am introducing today will remove all ambiguity about the responsibility of\nthe Federal Government to pay these normal and customary stormwater fees.”\n156 Cong. Rec. S4851, S4856 (2010) (statement of Senator Cardin).\n\n      Congress ultimately passed an amended version of Senator Cardin’s bill,\n\n                                          9\n\fwhich the President signed into law on January 4, 2011:\n\n             (c)   Reasonable Service Charges –\n\n             (1)   In general. For the purposes of this Act,\n                   reasonable service charges described in subsection\n                   (a) include any reasonable nondiscriminatory fee,\n                   charge, or assessment that is –\n\n                   (A)    based on some fair approximation of the\n                          proportionate contribution of the property or\n                          facility to stormwater pollution (in terms of\n                          quantities of pollutants, or volume or rate of\n                          stormwater discharge or runoff from the\n                          property or facility); and\n\n                   (B)    used to pay or reimburse the costs associated\n                          with any stormwater management program\n                          (whether associated with a separate storm\n                          sewer system or a sewer system that\n                          manages a combination of stormwater and\n                          sanitary waste), including the full range of\n                          programmatic and structural costs\n                          attributable to collecting stormwater,\n                          reducing pollutants in stormwater, and\n                          reducing the volume and rate of stormwater\n                          discharge, regardless of whether that\n                          reasonable fee, charge, or assessment is\n                          denominated a tax.\n\nPub. L. No. 111-378, 124 Stat. 4128 (2011). In addition, the amendment stated\nthat federal agencies “shall not be obligated to pay or reimburse any fee, charge, or\nassessment described in paragraph (1), except to the extent and in an amount\nprovided in advance by any appropriations Act to pay or reimburse the fee, charge,\nor assessment.” Id. at 4128-29.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f       C.      The Federal Properties in this Case\n\n       The United States owns a number of properties located within the county.\nIn this case, the County seeks to recover unpaid stormwater management charges\nassessed against eighteen different properties – six owned by the United States and\ntwelve owned by the Postal Service – for the years 2005 through 2010. Plaintiff\nasserts that the government has been inconsistent in its payment of stormwater\nmanagement charges for its properties, “paying the fees in full for some properties\nand facilities and refusing to pay for other similar properties and facilities.”\nCompl. ¶ 27. The County has demanded payment of the charges for many years,\nand notified the government of its intent to pursue its claims in court in letters\ndated March 9, 2010 and October 13, 2011. Id. ¶¶ 28-29.\n\n       The government concedes that it is now required, under section 1323, to pay\nall stormwater management charges accruing after January 4, 2011, the date of the\nmost recent amendment to that section.7 In this case, the parties do not dispute\nwhether the government is required to pay those charges now and in the future.\nRather, the parties’ disagreement here centers on whether the government is liable\nto the County for charges that were assessed against federal properties in the years\n2005 through 2010.\n\nII.    Procedural History\n\n       On November 14, 2011, the County filed its complaint in this case, in which\nit argues that the federal government has waived its sovereign immunity from\n“reasonable service charges” under section 1323 of the Clean Water Act, and that\nthe stormwater management charges plaintiff seeks to recover in this case are\nwithin the scope of that waiver. The County requests $281,553.12 in damages,\nplus interest, attorneys’ fees, and other related expenses. The amount requested by\nthe County is limited to charges that accrued before section 1323 was amended on\n\n\n       7\n         / While the government concedes that the 2011 amendment of section 1323 created a\nprospective obligation to pay the County’s stormwater management charges, there is some\nuncertainty with respect to the government’s diligence in making those payments. Compare\nPl.’s Resp. at 16 n.9 (stating that the United States has “paid the majority of such fees incurred\nsince § 1323(c) became law on January 4, 2011”) with Booth Aff. ¶ 9 (“No [fewer] than fifteen\n(15) federal facilities are now delinquent in paying stormwater utility fees due DeKalb County\nfor calendar year 2011.”).\n\n                                                11\n\fJanuary 4, 2011.\n\n       On February 27, 2012, the government filed a motion to dismiss this action\npursuant to RCFC 12(b)(1) and RCFC 12(b)(6). Defendant raises two arguments\nin its motion to dismiss. First, defendant argues that any claims that accrued before\nNovember 14, 2005 must be dismissed as untimely under 28 U.S.C. § 2501 (2006).\nSecond, defendant asserts that each of the County’s remaining claims must be\ndismissed for failure to state a claim because those claims seek the recovery of\nstate taxes that were levied upon federal properties before the United States waived\nits immunity from such taxes.\n\n       On April 30, 2012, the County filed its response to the government’s motion\nto dismiss, as well as a motion for partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiff.\nIn response to defendant’s argument that some of the County’s claims were not\ntimely, plaintiff asserts that its stormwater management charges are not due until\nDecember 31st of each year, and do not become delinquent until January 1st of the\nfollowing year. For that reason, plaintiff argues that none of its claims accrued\nbefore January 1, 2006, which was less than six years before it filed its suit in this\ncourt. With respect to defendant’s argument that the County’s charges are\nimpermissible taxes that were not covered by the pre-2011 version of section 1323,\nplaintiff responds that its charges are not taxes but fees, which fall squarely within\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section 1323.\n\n       On May 7, 2012, the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, the\nNational Association of Flood and Stormwater Management Agencies, and the\nAmerican Public Works Association filed a motion for leave of the court to file an\namicus curiae brief in support of the County. The court granted that motion on\nMay 15, 2012. In their brief, amici argue that the 2011 amendment should not be\nread to contain a new waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity. Instead,\naccording to amici, the 2011 amendment must be viewed as a mere clarification of\nthe waiver of sovereign immunity contained in the earlier version of section 1323.\nFor that reason, amici contend that the government is liable for the charges that\naccrued before the 2011 amendment was enacted.\n\n      On July 20, 2012, defendant filed a reply in support of its motion to dismiss,\nas well as its response to the County’s motion for summary judgment. In its reply,\nthe government rejects the County’s contention that none of the charges assessed in\n2005 accrued until January 1, 2006. In that regard, the government notes that the\n\n                                          12\n\fCounty sent the government an invoice for approximately half of those charges in\nthe summer of 2005, and that the invoice informed the government that the charges\nwere due no later than August 15, 2005. For that reason, the government argues\nthat any claims related to those charges accrued more than six years before the\ncomplaint was filed in this case. The government further asserts that the charges at\nissue in this case are taxes rather than fees, that the government had not waived its\nimmunity from such taxes until January 2011, and that the 2011 amendment cannot\nbe read as a clarification of an earlier waiver of immunity.\n\n        On September 25, 2012, the County filed its reply in support of its motion\nfor summary judgment. In its reply, the County disagrees with the legal tests\nendorsed by the government in its motion, but further argues that its stormwater\nutility charges are fees irrespective of which test is applied. The County also\nendorses and adopts the principal argument advanced by amici in their brief, i.e.,\nthat the 2011 amendment to section 1323 may be applied retroactively as a\nclarification of the earlier version of that section.\n\n      This matter was transferred to the undersigned pursuant to RCFC 40.1 on\nOctober 17, 2012, and the court heard oral argument from counsel on the parties’\ndispositive motions on November 30, 2012.8\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\nI.

Analysis\n\n       In its motion, defendant advances two separate grounds for dismissing the\nclaims set forth in the County’s complaint. First, defendant argues that any claims\nrelated to stormwater utility charges that were billed to the government more than\n\n                                           14\n\fsix years before the complaint was filed are precluded by the court’s statute of\nlimitations and must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1). Second, defendant\nasserts that the remaining claims must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(6) because\n(1) the County’s assessments constitute taxes; (2) the government did not waive its\nimmunity from state or local taxes used to fund stormwater management systems\nuntil January 4, 2011; and (3) that waiver may not be applied retroactively to cover\nstormwater utility charges that were levied before that date.\n\n        The court must first address the County’s assertion that defendant’s motion\nto dismiss must be converted into a motion for summary judgment because it relies\non material outside of the pleadings. That assertion is incorrect for three reasons.\nFirst, the court is not required to convert a motion to dismiss into a motion for\nsummary judgment unless the court relies upon evidence outside of the pleadings\nin resolving the motion. See RCFC 12(d) (requiring conversion only when\n“matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court”)\n(emphasis added). Neither of the documents attached to the government’s motion\nto dismiss is necessary to the court’s resolution of that motion.\n\n       Furthermore, to the extent that the court must rely on any material outside of\nthe pleadings in this case, such reliance is limited to the government’s motion to\ndismiss under RCFC 12(b)(1). The requirement set forth in RCFC 12(d) – i.e., that\nmotions to dismiss must be treated as motions for summary judgment when the\ncourt relies on evidence outside of the pleadings – is, by its own terms, limited to\nmotions to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6) and RCFC 12(c). In resolving motions to\ndismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under RCFC 12(b)(1), in contrast,\nthe court is free to make findings of fact based on evidence not contained in the\npleadings. See Rocovich, 933 F.2d at 993; Martinez, 48 Fed. Cl. at 857.\n\n      Finally, both of the documents attached to the government’s motion to\ndismiss are matters of public record that were printed from the County’s own\nwebsite. The court may consider those documents in resolving the motion to\ndismiss without converting that motion into one for summary judgment. See\nSebastian v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765468\"><a href=\"/opinion/765468/eleanor-sebastian-lewis-hinson-robert-lowery-charles-w-newhouser/\"><span class=\"volume\">185</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (“In deciding\nwhether to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the court may consider\nmatters of public record.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f      A.     Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       In its motion to dismiss, defendant argues that this court does not have\njurisdiction over any claims for the recovery of stormwater utility charges that\nwere billed to the government more than six years before the County filed its\ncomplaint in this case. Because the complaint was filed on November 14, 2011,\ndefendant argues that the County’s attempt to recoup unpaid stormwater charges\nthat were billed more than six years before that date are untimely under 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2501. Further, although the issue was not raised by defendant, the court must\ndetermine whether plaintiff has identified a money-mandating source of\nsubstantive law for purposes of this court’s jurisdiction under the Tucker Act,\n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1) (2006). For the reasons set forth below, the court holds\nthat plaintiff has identified a money-mandating source of law, but further\nconcludes that the County’s claims to recover stormwater utility charges that were\nbilled to the government before November 14, 2005 are untimely and must be\ndismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n             1.    The Court Does Not Possess Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n                   over Claims for the Recovery of Stormwater Utility Charges\n                   Billed to Defendant before November 14, 2005\n\n        Section 2501 provides in relevant part that “[e]very claim of which the\nUnited States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the\npetition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2501. The United States Supreme Court has held that the six-year limitations\nperiod is an absolute jurisdictional bar that cannot be waived by the government.\nSee John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145838\"><a href=\"/opinion/145838/john-r-sand-gravel-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133-34 (2008)\n(holding that the statute of limitations contained in section 2501 is jurisdictional\nand is not subject to tolling, waiver, or estoppel). The County filed its suit on\nNovember 14, 2011. In order to be considered within the limitations period set\nforth in section 2501, the County’s claims must have accrued no earlier than\nNovember 14, 2005. If any of its claims accrued before that date, then the court is\nwithout jurisdiction to hear them. The Federal Circuit has explained that a claim\nfirst accrues for purposes of the six-year limitations period “when all the events\nhave occurred which fix the liability of the Government and entitle the claimant to\ninstitute an action.” Alder Terrace, 161 F.3d at 1377.\n\n      The County asserts that the stormwater management charges it levied on\n\n                                          16\n\ffederal properties in 2005 were not due until the end of that year and did not\nbecome delinquent until January 1, 2006. See Booth Aff. ¶ 5. In addition, the\nCounty contends that a claim seeking payment for services rendered accrues, and\nthe statute of limitations begins to run, only when “‘the last services are\nrendered.’” Pl.’s Resp. at 19 (quoting Empire Inst. of Tailoring, Inc. v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ct. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (1958)). Inasmuch as the charges for 2005 were based\non services that plaintiff argues were rendered until December 31, 2005, the\nCounty contends that its claims related to the recovery of those charges were\ntimely because they did not accrue more than six years before the complaint was\nfiled in this case.\n\n       Defendant, in contrast, contends that under the continuing claims doctrine,\n“‘the cause of action for pay or compensation accrues as soon as the payor fails or\nrefuses to pay what the law (or the contract) requires; there is no other condition\nprecedent to the accrual of the cause of action.’” Def.’s Reply at 7 (quoting\nFriedman v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (Ct. Cl. 1962)). Furthermore,\naccording to defendant, “‘where the payments are to be made periodically, each\nsuccessive failure to make proper payment gives rise to a new claim upon which\nsuit can be brought.’” Id. at 8 (citation omitted). The government received an\ninvoice for stormwater management charges in the summer of 2005. On that\ninvoice, the County stated that the stormwater utility charge is calculated on an\nannual basis, but is due in two equal installments on August 15, 2005, and\nNovember 15, 2005. See Booth Aff. Ex. 1. Based on that invoice, the government\nargues that any of the County’s claims related to stormwater charges levied on\nfederal properties in the first half of 2005 are untimely.9\n\n      The County does not dispute that it sent an invoice to the government for its\ncharges in July 2005, see Tr. at 53, and that invoice expressly states that the\ncharges “are due in two equal installments: August 15th and November 15th,”\nBooth Aff. Ex. 1. The County argues, however, that the dates indicated on the\n\n\n       9\n        / In its motion, defendant asserts that the County’s stormwater management charges\naccrue on a continuous basis beginning on January 1st of each year. Based on that assertion,\ndefendant argues that more than ten months’ worth of the charges imposed on federal properties\nin 2005 are time-barred under section 2501. In its reply in support of its motion, however, the\ngovernment appears to have abandoned that argument, instead asserting that the County’s claims\nare untimely with respect to half of the stormwater management charges levied in 2005 – i.e.,\nthose included on the July 2005 invoice.\n\n                                              17\n\finvoice are not really due dates. Rather, plaintiff contends those dates allow\nproperty owners to prepay their stormwater charges as an administrative\nconvenience, but the charges were not actually due until December 31, 2005. Id.\n¶¶ 5-7.\n\n       The County’s argument is not, however, supported by the record in this case.\nNothing in the stormwater ordinance states that stormwater management\nassessments are due on December 31st, or that they are not considered delinquent\nuntil January 1st of the following year. Instead, the ordinance states that “[t]he\nstormwater service fee shall accrue beginning January 1, 2004, and shall be billed\nannually thereafter.” County Code § 25-366. The ordinance also requires the\nCounty to inform property owners of the date on which the charges are due, and\nrequires property owners to pay a one percent per month late fee for charges that\nare delinquent.10 Id. § 25-371(b). The County sent the government an invoice for\nstormwater utility charges in July 2005, and that invoice unequivocally informed\nthe government that half of its annual liability for those charges was due no later\nthan August 15th of that year. Because the government did not pay the\nassessments for the first half of 2005 by the specified date, the County could have\ncommenced an action to recover those charges the next day, on August 16, 2005.\nThus, the deputy tax commissioner’s statement that the charges were not actually\ndelinquent until January 1st of the next year cannot override the August 15th\ndeadline imposed by the County’s invoice or suspend the accrual of the County’s\nclaims for purposes of the limitations period. For the foregoing reasons, the court\nholds that any claims related to stormwater charges for the first half of 2005 were\nuntimely and must be dismissed under RCFC 12(b)(1).\n\n               2.      Section 1323(a) of the Clean Water Act Is a\n                       Money-Mandating Source of Law for Purposes\n                       of this Court’s Jurisdiction under the Tucker Act\n\n       With respect to the remaining claims presented by plaintiff, in order to\nestablish jurisdiction in this court, the County must demonstrate that the\n\n       10\n          / While the County describes the stormwater assessment as an annual charge, and the\nordinance states that those charges shall be billed annually, see County Code § 25-366, the\nordinance states that the charges are to be calculated on a monthly, rather than annual, basis, see\nid. § 25-365(b) (“The stormwater service charge per equivalent residential unit shall be four\ndollars ($4.00) per month or as amended by official action of the governing authority.”).\n\n                                                18\n\fgovernment has consented to suit and that there is a substantive legal basis for such\nclaims.

Another section of the same title addresses suits by and against the Postal Service, but\nthat section states only that “the United States district courts shall have original but not exclusive\njurisdiction over all actions brought by or against the Postal Service.” 39 U.S.C. § 409(a)\n(2006).

In contrast, the\n\n              “fair interpretation” rule demands a showing\n              demonstrably lower than the standard for the initial\n              waiver of sovereign immunity. “Because the Tucker Act\n              supplies a waiver of immunity for claims of this nature,\n              the separate statutes and regulations need not provide a\n              second waiver of sovereign immunity, nor need they be\n              construed in the manner appropriate to waivers of\n              sovereign immunity.” It is enough, then, that a statute\n              creating a Tucker Act right be reasonably amenable to\n              the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in\n              damages.

Rather, as the Federal Circuit\nhas explained,\n\n              [a]ssuming that the Court of Federal Claims has taken\n              jurisdiction over the cause as a result of the initial\n              determination that plaintiff’s cause rests on a money-\n\n       12\n         / There are two types of sovereign immunity implicated in this case. First, there is the\ngovernment’s immunity from suit, which was waived by the Tucker Act. In addition, there is the\ngovernment’s immunity from state and local taxation to fund stormwater management systems,\nwhich, as discussed in detail below, was not waived until January 4, 2011.\n\n                                               21\n\f             mandating source, the consequence of a ruling by the\n             court on the merits, that plaintiff’s case does not fit\n             within the scope of the source, is simply this: plaintiff\n             loses on the merits for failing to state a claim on which\n             relief can be granted.\n\nFisher, 402 F.3d at 1175-76. The same is true here. The court may exercise\njurisdiction over the County’s claims in this case, at least those that are timely,\nbecause section 1323 may fairly be interpreted to mandate the payment of money\nby the government. Notwithstanding that jurisdictional basis, the County has\nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it has failed to\ndemonstrate that its stormwater management charges fall within the scope of\nsection 1323.\n\n      B.     Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\n\n       In its motion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6), defendant argues that the\ncharges the County seeks to recover in this case are taxes that may not be imposed\non federal properties or facilities without the prior consent of the United States.\nDefendant concedes that Congress waived the government’s immunity from such\ntaxes when it amended section 1323 on January 4, 2011, but argues that the waiver\ncontained in the 2011 amendment cannot be applied retroactively, nor may it be\nviewed as an attempt by Congress to clarify an earlier waiver of immunity. In\norder to resolve the government’s motion, the court must address three separate\nquestions.\n\n       First, are the stormwater management charges at issue in this case properly\nviewed as taxes or fees? Second, if the charges are taxes rather than fees, did the\ngovernment unequivocally and unambiguously waive its immunity from such taxes\nin the 1977 amendments to the Clean Water Act? Finally, if the government did\nnot clearly waive its sovereign immunity in 1977, may the 2011 amendment be\ngiven retroactive effect as a mere clarification of the 1977 waiver, rather than as a\nnew and separate waiver of sovereign immunity?\n\n       The court concludes that the County’s stormwater management charge is a\ntax that cannot be imposed upon federal properties without the consent of the\nUnited States. The court further holds that Congress did not unequivocally waive\nthe federal government’s sovereign immunity from state taxation in 1977, and that\n\n                                         22\n\fthe 2011 amendment cannot be applied retroactively as a clarification of the initial\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. For those reasons, the court must grant defendant’s\nmotion to dismiss under RCFC 12(b)(6).\n\n             1.

The Massachusetts Test\n\n       The County argues that the test set forth in Massachusetts v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109824\"><a href=\"/opinion/109824/massachusetts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">444</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978), presents the most appropriate means of determining whether\nthe stormwater charges in this case are permissible fees or impermissible taxes.\nWhile the decisions of the Supreme Court are, of course, binding on this court,\nthe issues addressed in that case are not the issues now before this court, and the\n\n                                          24\n\fholding in that case does not apply here. First, the issue before the court in this\ncase is whether the County’s stormwater management charges are fees or taxes,\nwhile the issue before the Supreme Court in Massachusetts was whether a federal\ntax imposed upon state property was reasonable. Further, this case requires the\ncourt to determine whether the County’s stormwater charges are barred under the\nSupremacy Clause, while the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts was\nbased not on that clause, but on the states’ implied immunity from federal taxes.\n\n                           i.     Massachusetts Did Not Draw a Line between\n                                  Permissible Fees and Impermissible Taxes\n\n       In Massachusetts, the state argued that its implied immunity from federal\ntaxation prohibited the assessment of an annual registration tax on a state-owned\nhelicopter that was used exclusively for essential police functions. In reviewing\nthe constitutional validity of that tax, the Supreme Court created a three-part test,\nwhich provides that federal taxes imposed on a state or its property do not violate\nthat state’s implied immunity from federal taxation when: (1) the tax is imposed in\na nondiscriminatory manner; (2) the tax is a fair approximation of the benefits\nreceived by the taxed entity; and (3) the tax does not produce revenues that exceed\nthe cost of the benefits provided. Massachusetts, 435 U.S. at 467. While the tax at\nissue in Massachusetts was designed to resemble a user fee in some respects, there\nwas no dispute that the tax was in fact a tax.\n\n       Thus, the court is not faced with a choice between two competing tests for\ndetermining whether a particular charge is a fee or a tax. The Massachusetts test\ndoes not address that issue; instead, that test answers an entirely different question:\nwhen do federal taxes imposed on a state or its property unduly interfere with the\ntraditional and essential functions of the state, thereby violating that state’s implied\nimmunity from federal taxation? In other words, the Massachusetts test does not\nattempt to draw a line between fees and taxes, but instead determines whether a tax\nis reasonable.\n\n     The Massachusetts test might be useful for evaluating whether the County’s\nstormwater management charges are reasonable, but it cannot determine whether\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fthey are fees.13 In fact, Congress adopted the basic framework of that test in the\n2011 amendment to section 1323. Because the waiver contained in section 1323 is\nlimited to “reasonable service charges,” the new language in the statute ensures\nthat the government’s liability under that section is in fact limited to charges that\nare reasonable. In this case, however, the government does not contest or dispute\nthe reasonableness of the County’s stormwater charges. See Tr. at 22-23. Rather,\nthe government argues only that the charges are taxes, and that Congress did not\nwaive the government’s immunity from such taxes until January 4, 2011.\n\n                              ii.    The Supreme Court’s Holding in Massachusetts\n                                     Was Not Based on the Supremacy Clause\n\n       The Supreme Court’s analysis in Massachusetts is also inapposite because it\nwas not based upon the Supremacy Clause. In contrast to the federal government’s\nimmunity from state and local taxation, which is based on the Supremacy Clause,\nthe states’ immunity from federal taxation “was judicially implied from the States’\nrole in the constitutional scheme.” Massachusetts, 435 U.S. at 455. For that\nreason, state immunity from federal taxation is not absolute, in sharp contrast to the\nfederal government’s categorical immunity from state taxation. See City of\nColumbia, 914 F.2d at 153 (“Generally, the states are immune from federal\ntaxation that would unduly burden essential state functions. Federal immunity\nfrom state taxation, however, is a blanket immunity and is not subject to the same\nlimits.”).\n\n      The Supremacy Clause categorically prohibits state and local taxation of\nfederal property. For that reason, the test described in Massachusetts – which is\nused to determine whether federal taxes on state-owned property violate that state’s\nimplied immunity from federal taxation – cannot be applied in this case. See, e.g.,\nOneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin v. Village of Hobart, No. 10-C-137, 2012\n\n\n       13\n         / Indeed, in the case of United States v.

Instead, the question before that court was whether the charges at issue – which the parties\nagreed were fees – were unreasonable. The First Circuit noted that the government had waived\nits immunity only with respect to reasonable service charges, and then applied the\nMassachusetts test for the purpose of evaluating the government’s contention that the licensing\nfees imposed by the state were unreasonably high. The statute at issue in Maine was the\nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 6901-6992k (2006), which contains a\nprovision that is substantially similar to the Federal Facilities Section of the Clean Water Act.\n\n\n                                                27\n\f               subject to its regulation.

Those courts have applied that analysis as a three-part inquiry that asks the\nfollowing questions. First, which governmental entity imposed the charge? Next,\nwhich parties must pay the charge? And finally, for whose benefit are the revenues\ngenerated by the charge spent?\n\n       The County and amici argue that San Juan Cellular, and many of the other\ncases that applied its analysis, are simply inapplicable here because the question in\nthose cases was whether the charge at issue was a fee or a tax for purposes of the\nTax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1341, and not whether a state charge could\nbe assessed against federal property without violating the Supremacy Clause.15\nWhile that observation is correct, the court does not find it to be particularly\nrelevant.

The court finds the analysis in San Juan Cellular to be\npersuasive and holds that the use of a three-part test based on that analysis\nrepresents an appropriate approach to drawing the line between fees and taxes.\nFinally, as discussed in more detail below, the third – and most important – factor\nof the San Juan Cellular inquiry is fully consistent with the Supreme Court’s\nobservation that a government agency that provides a service “may exact a fee for\na grant which, presumably, bestows a benefit on the applicant, not shared by other\n\n       15\n          / In San Juan Cellular, the First Circuit determined whether a regulatory charge was a\nfee or a tax under the Butler Act, 48 U.S.C. § 872 (2006), a statute designed to minimize the\ninterference of federal courts with the collection of taxes imposed under the laws of Puerto Rico,\nin the same way that the TIA minimizes such interference with respect to state and local taxes.\n\n                                                28\n\fmembers of society.” Nat’l Cable Television Ass’n v.

The court notes the legal context in which the San Juan Cellular\nanalysis was first developed, but nonetheless holds that it is the more appropriate\nanalytical framework for the question now before the court.\n\n                           i.     Which Entity Imposed the Charge?\n\n       First, the court must examine which governmental entity imposed the charge\nin this case. When an assessment is imposed by a legislative body, rather than an\nadministrative agency, it is more likely to be viewed as a tax than as a fee. See\nSan Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 686. Here, the stormwater charges were adopted,\nand their precise amounts were set, by the County’s board of commissioners.\nThe stormwater utility does not have the authority to revise the rates set forth in the\nordinance; instead, the specified rates may be amended only by action of the\n“governing authority” – i.e., the County’s board of commissioners and chief\nexecutive. See County Code § 25-365(b) (“The stormwater service charge per\nequivalent residential unit shall be four dollars ($4.00) per month or as amended\nby official action of the governing authority.”) (emphasis added).\n\n        Some courts have noted that “[i]f the responsibility for administering and\ncollecting the assessment lies with the general tax assessor, it is more likely to be a\ntax; if this responsibility lies with a regulatory agency, it is more likely to be a fee.”\nCollins Holding, 123 F.3d at 800. Here, the County’s stormwater charges are\nbilled to the government on an invoice from the County’s tax commissioner. See\nBooth Aff. Ex. 1. The County’s deputy tax commissioner, who is also its director\nfor delinquent collections, “oversee[s] collection of delinquent stormwater utility\nfees on behalf of DeKalb County, Georgia.” Id. ¶ 3. The stormwater utility does\nnot collect the assessments that are ultimately deposited into the enterprise fund.\nThe stormwater charges in this case were adopted and set by the County’s\nlegislative body, and they are collected by the County’s tax collector. Those facts,\nunder the first prong of the San Juan Cellular test, suggest that the stormwater\nassessments in this case are taxes rather than fees.\n\n                           ii.    Which Parties Must Pay the Charge?\n\n       Next, the court must examine which parties are subject to the assessments.\nIf the charge is imposed upon all citizens, or a broad class of them, then the charge\nis more likely to be a tax; if the charge is imposed only upon a narrow group, then\n\n                                           29\n\fthe charge is more likely to be a fee. San Juan Cellular, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Here, the\nCounty’s stormwater management charge is not assessed against a narrow group of\nresidents or businesses; instead, the assessment is levied against every single owner\nof developed property in the unincorporated portions of the county.16\n\n       The stormwater charge is assessed against every dwelling in the county, as\nwell as “commercial and office buildings, industrial and manufacturing buildings,\nstorage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots,\nparks, recreation properties, public and private schools and universities, research\nstations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, and agricultural uses covered\nby impervious surfaces.” County Code § 25-361 (providing definitions of “single\ndwelling lot,” “multiple dwelling lot,” and “other developed land”); id. § 25-365\n(setting the charges applicable to single dwelling lots, multiple dwelling lots, and\nother developed land). The ordinance further notes that the majority of the land\nwithin the unincorporated portion of the county is in fact developed. Id.\n§ 25-360(d).\n\n       In sum, the stormwater charges that the County seeks to recover in this case\nare imposed upon every homeowner who lives in the unincorporated portion of the\ncounty and every business that is located there, as well as every other lot that is\ncovered with any impervious surface, ranging from the smallest doghouse to the\nlargest church, airport, or sports stadium. Because the County’s stormwater charge\nis not assessed against a narrow group, but is instead imposed on the majority of\nproperty in the unincorporated portions of the county, see id. § 25-360(d), the\nsecond factor of the San Juan Cellular inquiry also suggests that the charge is a\ntax.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          / The term “developed land” is defined as all property that is not “undeveloped land,”\nwhich is in turn defined as “a lot in its unaltered natural state and which has no pavement,\nasphalt, or compacted gravel surfaces or structures which create an impervious surface that\nwould prevent infiltration of stormwater or cause stormwater to collect, concentrate, or flow in a\nmanner materially different than that which would occur if the land was in an unaltered natural\nstate.” County Code § 25-361. In other words, with the exception of rights of way – both public\nand railroad – developed land includes any property covered with any amount of impervious\nsurface.\n\n                                               30\n\f                          iii.   For Whose Benefit Are the Revenues Spent?\n\n       Finally, the court must examine for whose benefit the revenues generated by\nthe charge are spent. If the County spends the revenue to provide a benefit for the\ngeneral public, then the charge is more likely to be a tax, but if the revenue is spent\nto provide a particularized benefit for a narrow group, or to offset the cost of\nregulating a narrow group, then the charge is more likely to be a fee. Here, the\ncourt concludes that the stormwater management charges are used to finance\nbenefits that inure primarily to the benefit of the general public.\n\n       The First Circuit has explained that the third part of the San Juan Cellular\ninquiry is often the most important: “[c]ourts facing cases that lie near the middle\nof this spectrum have tended . . . to emphasize the revenue’s ultimate use, asking\nwhether it provides a general benefit to the public, of a sort often financed by a\ngeneral tax, or whether it provides more narrow benefits to regulated companies or\ndefrays the agency’s costs of regulation.” San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685.\n\n       The stormwater ordinance describes the purpose of the utility, noting that the\n“provision of stormwater management services and facilities in DeKalb County\npromotes an essential regulatory purpose by controlling where stormwater runoff\nflows and how it is disposed, and thereby reducing flooding, erosion and water\npollution caused by stormwater runoff.” County Code § 25-360(e). Further, the\nordinance explains that\n\n             [t]he board of commissioners is responsible for the\n             protection and preservation of the public health, safety,\n             and welfare of the community, and finds that it is in the\n             best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the\n             citizens of the county and the community at large to\n             proceed with the development, implementation, and\n             operation of a utility for stormwater management\n             accounted for in the county budget as a separate\n             enterprise fund dedicated solely to stormwater\n             management and to institute funding methods associated\n             therewith.\n\nId. § 360(g); see also Tr. at 36 (noting that revenue deposited in the enterprise fund\nis spent to further the purposes of drainage control and flood control), 38\n\n                                          31\n\f(explaining that the stormwater utility promotes the essential regulatory purposes\nof preventing floods, erosion, and water pollution).\n\n        The purposes of the stormwater ordinance, and of the stormwater system –\ni.e., flood prevention and the abatement of water pollution – are benefits that are\nenjoyed by the general public. For that reason, the charge is more properly viewed\nas a tax than as a fee. See San Juan Cellular, 967 F.2d at 685 (noting that the\nrevenue from a tax “is spent for the benefit of the entire community”). Those\nbenefits are public; they are not individualized services provided to particular\ncustomers.\n\n       The presence of a stormwater management system, and the imposition of\ncharges to fund that system, create reciprocal benefits and burdens for nearly all\nowners of developed property within the unincorporated areas of DeKalb County.\nWhile each property owner is burdened by payment of the charge, and enjoys no\nspecial benefit by virtue of the connection of its own property to that system, the\nproperty owner does derive a benefit from the fact that stormwater runoff from\nother properties is collected and diverted by the system. That benefit, however, is\none that is shared with nearly every other member of the community. In short,\nflood control is a public benefit, and charges to pay for that benefit are typically\nviewed as taxes. See, e.g., United States v. City of Huntington, W.V., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611619\"><a href=\"/opinion/611619/united-states-v-city-of-huntington-west-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n73 (4th Cir. 1993) (explaining that because flood control and fire prevention are\nboth “core government services,” assessments to pay for those services are taxes).\n\n       The abatement of water pollution is also an important benefit of the system,\nand it is likewise a public benefit that is shared with the rest of the community.\nThe owners of developed property, who pay the stormwater management charges,\nreceive no special benefit from clean rivers, streams, and lakes that is not also\nenjoyed by the general public.

The County argues that it is this service – the reduction\nin the risk of legal liability due to damage from stormwater runoff – that transforms\nthe assessment here into a fee rather than a tax.\n\n       The court first notes that it is not clear whether defendant would in fact be\nsubject to any liability for damage to neighboring properties due to stormwater\nrunoff from federal facilities. During oral argument, counsel for amici suggested\nthat the government might be subject to an action under the citizen-suit provision\nof the CWA, 33 U.S.C. § 1365 (2006), but both he and counsel for the County\nwere uncertain as to whether the government might be subject to liability for either\ntrespass or nuisance under the common law of Georgia.17 However, the court need\nnot determine the extent of the government’s liability for such damage because the\nso-called “benefit” cited by the County is problematic in a number of respects.\n\n       17\n         / The court notes that the government might be subject to suit in certain circumstances\nunder the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

The ordinance further states that “[a]ny failure to meet this\nobligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by\nany damaged party or DeKalb County in any court of competent jurisdiction.” Id.\nIn short, payment of the charge does not appear to relieve any property owner of its\nliability for damage to neighboring properties caused by stormwater runoff.\n\n       In addition, even if payment of the stormwater charges effectively protected\nproperty owners from such liability, there is no apparent relationship between the\nvalue of the benefit and the amount of the charge. The stormwater assessment is\ngenerally based on the amount of impervious surface on the charged property.\nWhile that measurement may provide a rough approximation of the quantity of\nstormwater runoff generated by that property, it does not have any clear connection\nto the amount of damage such runoff might cause to neighboring properties and,\nconsequently, the property owner’s potential liability for such damage. Instead, the\ndamage due to stormwater runoff from a particular property will depend upon a\nnumber of other factors, such as topography, whether the surrounding properties\nare developed, and the types of improvements located on those properties.18\n\n       18\n         / This absence of proportionality might be more relevant to the reasonableness of the\ncharge, rather than whether the charge is a fee or a tax, but the court believes that the apparent\nlack of proportionality also undermines the County’s argument that “liability protection” is an\n\n                                                34\n\f        While user fees are generally based on the quantum of services that are\nprovided, the assessments in this case are not necessarily based on the benefits\nprovided to each owner of developed property. First, the stormwater charges in\nthis case are based not on the benefits derived by the payor, but by the anticipated\nburden that its property imposes on the stormwater system. However, the burden\nimposed on the system by the runoff from the property, and the benefits conferred\nupon that property by the system are not the same thing. There may be properties,\nfor example, that impose significant burdens on the stormwater system while\nderiving no substantial benefit from that system (e.g., a property with extensive\nimpervious coverage that is located on the top of a hill). Similarly, there may be\nproperties that have little impact on the stormwater system that receive substantial\nbenefits from that system (e.g., a small home on a large, otherwise undeveloped lot\nthat is located downhill from extensive development). Second, even if the benefits\nconferred on specific properties and the burdens those properties impose on the\nsystem were treated as if they were the same, the amount of the charge does not\ndepend upon the burden actually imposed on the system by a particular property.\nRegardless of how much rain falls on a property, and how much of that rain\nactually leaves the property and flows into the system, the charge remains the\nsame.

See Pl.’s Resp. at\n18. The fact that the revenue generated by the stormwater management charge is\nsegregated from other revenue, and is ultimately deposited into a separate\nenterprise fund, is not a sufficient basis for determining that the charge is a fee.\nSee Valero, 205 F.3d at 135 (explaining that “[i]f the revenue of the special fund is\nused to benefit the population at large then the segregation of the revenue to a\nspecial fund is immaterial”) (citation omitted). Here, the revenue from the charge\nis used to fund a stormwater management system that benefits the public at large,\nso the fact that the revenue is segregated into a separate account is not especially\n\n\nindividualized service provided to property owners in exchange for payment of the charge.\n\n                                              35\n\frelevant.19\n\n       The court does not doubt the precarious financial situation of the County and\nother similarly situated counties and municipalities all over the country. The cost\nof operating stormwater management facilities has increased dramatically in recent\nyears, and much of that increase is attributable to new requirements imposed by the\nfederal government. Further, the tax-exempt status of federal facilities and other\nproperties that impose significant burdens on the stormwater management system\nhas severely limited the ability of local governments to fully recoup those costs.\nIn light of the difficulties – both legal and political – of raising taxes, many\ncounties and municipalities have attempted to structure their taxes as user fees to\navoid the legal restrictions that apply to the former but not to the latter.\n\n       Unfortunately, the nature of a stormwater management system, which\nbenefits the public without providing any individualized, measurable benefit to\nindividual property owners, does not lend itself to a system of funding based on\nuser fees. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has noted that\n“[w]hen a fee is imposed on the United States for the purpose of extracting by fee\nthat which cannot be extracted by taxation, the imposition of that fee may violate\nthe Supremacy Clause.” Novato Fire Prot.

The Involuntary Nature of the Charge\n\n       The government argues that the charges in this case should be viewed as\ntaxes because they are involuntary, while the County asserts that its assessments\nare a fee for services rather than “an inescapable charge based solely upon the mere\nfact of property ownership.” Pl.’s Resp. at 17 n.10. In addition to finding that the\nCounty’s stormwater charges are taxes under the San Juan Cellular test, the court\nfurther concludes that the charges more closely resemble taxes due to their\ninvoluntary nature.\n\n       In National Cable, 415 U.S. at 340, the Supreme Court explained that\n“[a] fee is incident to a voluntary act.”20 In a number of other cases, the Court has\ncontrasted the voluntary nature of a fee with the mandatory nature of a tax.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

There, the\npetitioner had challenged licensing charges imposed upon cable television companies by the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) pursuant to the Independent Offices Appropriation\nAct of 1952, 31 U.S.C. § 9701 (2006), which authorized certain agencies to impose service\ncharges based on, inter alia, the value of the services provided to the recipient. The Court held\nthat Congress had not delegated the power of taxation to the FCC, and that the power granted to\nthe agency under the statute must therefore be limited to the authority to impose fees rather than\ntaxes. The Supreme Court reversed the lower appellate court with instructions to remand the\ncase to the FCC so the agency could determine whether its proposed service charges were\nproportionate to the cost of the services that were actually provided to the regulated companies.\nThe language from National Cable upon which the court now relies, however, is contained\nwithin a general discussion of the essential differences between fees and taxes, and its\napplicability is not limited to the facts of that case. In any event, National Cable is not the only\ncase in which the Supreme Court has described fees as voluntary and taxes as compulsory.\n\n                                                 37\n\fimprovements are involuntary exactions, and in that respect stand on the same\nfooting with ordinary taxes”).\n\n        Fees generally fall into two broad categories: user fees, which a government\nmay charge in exchange for services or the use of government-owned property, and\nregulatory fees, which are charges that are imposed by a regulatory agency to\nrecoup its costs of regulation. In both cases, the payment of the fee is voluntary.\nWith a user fee, one can avoid the charge by not accepting the government’s\nservices or by not using the government’s property. With a regulatory fee, one can\navoid the charge by not engaging in the regulated activity. See City of Columbia,\n914 F.2d at 156 (“When the United States purchases water, electricity, and related\nservices, and then pays the utility bill, it does so as a vendee pursuant to its\nvoluntary, contractual relationship with the City. The City imposes the charge not\nin its capacity as a sovereign, but as a vendor of goods and services.”).\n\n       Here, those subject to the stormwater utility charge have no choice but to\npay that charge. The government never requested stormwater management\nservices from the County, and it cannot simply decline to use those services.\nInstead, the government’s liability arises solely from its status as the owner of\ndeveloped property located within the unincorporated part of the county. See id. at\n155 (noting that “[t]he United States’ obligation to pay [a user fee] arises only from\nits consensual purchase of the City’s property; it does not arise automatically, as\ndoes tax liability, from the United States’ status as a property owner”). The\nFederal Circuit has held that a stormwater management charge that is based solely\non the mere ownership of property is involuntary. See Cincinnati, 153 F.3d at\n1377-78. There, the court explained that a charge applicable to all owners of\ndeveloped property and based on the amount of runoff the property was expected\nto generate was not a voluntary purchase of services:\n\n             The storm drainage service charge was not imposed as a\n             result of a consensual arrangement between the city and\n             the United States, as would be true in the case of a\n             voluntary purchase of utilities or other services. Instead,\n             the stormwater drainage service charge was an\n             assessment imposed on the United States involuntarily,\n             by virtue of its status as a property owner. While the\n             United States may be said to be a beneficiary of the storm\n             drainage services provided by the city, it was not offered\n\n                                         38\n\f               the opportunity to choose whether to accept those\n               benefits, and it cannot be said to have taken any action\n               (other than not moving out of Cincinnati when the\n               charges were assessed) to indicate its willingness to pay\n               the charges.\n\nId. The Federal Circuit concluded that the involuntary nature of the stormwater\ncharge defeated the city’s assertion of an implied-in-fact contract for services.21\n\n       In addition, the County cannot realistically terminate service to any property\ndue to the nonpayment of stormwater charges. During oral argument, when the\ncourt asked counsel for the County whether it was physically possible to deny any\nparticular property owner the benefits of the stormwater management system, he\nresponded that the County could “plug up the drainage system with concrete.”22\nTr. at 94. However, the County has a legal obligation to operate its stormwater\nmanagement system in accordance with the requirements set forth in its NPDES\npermit, and disabling portions of that system would be an abdication of its legal\n\n\n       21\n         / The Federal Circuit expressly declined to address whether the stormwater charge in\nthat case was a fee or a tax, Cincinnati, 153 F.3d at 1378, and noted that the involuntary nature\nof a charge, without more, is not necessarily sufficient to transform the charge into a tax:\n\n               The involuntary nature of the charge, however, is not dispositive.\n               There may be some instances in which a municipal assessment is\n               involuntarily imposed but would nonetheless be considered a\n               permissible fee for services rather than an impermissible tax.\n\nId. Here, the court’s determination that the County’s stormwater management charges are taxes\nis not based solely on the involuntary nature of those charges. Rather, the compulsory nature of\nthe charge is just one consideration in addition to the court’s determination that the assessment is\na tax under the San Juan Cellular test.\n       22\n           / The court did not understand counsel’s response to be a serious answer to the court’s\nquestion. If the County were to physically obstruct the storm drains closest to the government’s\nfacilities, runoff from those facilities would almost certainly find its way into the stormwater\nmanagement system somewhere else, while possibly causing damage to other nearby properties.\nWith the exception of some fanciful approaches, such as acquiring land around the perimeter of\nthe federal properties to construct levies that completely prevent stormwater runoff from leaving\nthose properties, there does not appear to be any physical means of denying any particular\nproperty owner the benefits of the stormwater management system.\n\n                                                39\n\fresponsibility to manage the stormwater within its service area, including runoff\nthat originates on federal properties.\n\n       If it were possible to deny any particular property owner the benefits of the\nstormwater management system, one would expect the ordinance to provide for the\ntermination of services due to nonpayment. Instead, the ordinance provides that\n“[u]npaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an\nunpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any\njudgment obtained thereby.” County Code § 25-371(a). Because the default\nmethod of addressing nonpayment is litigation, rather than termination of service,\nthe stormwater management charges at issue in this case yet again appear to be\ntaxes rather than fees. See City of Columbia, 914 F.2d at 155 (noting that “while\nfailure to pay a tax results in civil and sometimes criminal penalties, the failure to\npay a portion of a utility rate results in termination of services”).\n\n       Finally, the County argues that its stormwater management charges are\nvoluntary because property owners may receive credits against the charges for\nadopting specified stormwater management systems on their own property, and\nmay even receive a complete exemption from the charges if they manage 100\npercent of the rainfall on their property on their own land. The court does not\nbelieve that the availability of such credits and exemptions alters the nature of the\ncharge – it is still a tax, regardless of whether some of those subject to the tax may\nreceive a partial or even total exemption by constructing and operating costly\nstormwater management facilities on their own property. In addition, the credits –\nin contrast to the full exemption – may amount to no more forty percent of the\nassessed charge, so that property owners who manage ninety-nine percent of their\nstormwater on-site will still be subject to sixty percent of the normal assessment.\nSee County Code § 25-369(a). Finally, as the government has noted, the Internal\nRevenue Code, Title 26 of the United States Code (2006), provides a number of\ncredits and exemptions from tax liability, but those credits and exemptions do not\ntransform federal taxes into fees.\n\n             2.     Section 1323(a), prior to the 2011 Amendment, Did Not\n                    Waive the Federal Government’s Sovereign Immunity\n                    from State or Local Taxation\n\n       The County and amici argue that the language of section 1323 – even before\nit was amended in 2011 – represents an unequivocal waiver of the government’s\n\n                                          40\n\fimmunity from the type of stormwater management charges at issue in this case.\nThe government concedes that section 1323, as amended in 2011, subjects it to\nprospective liability for stormwater management charges, whether characterized as\nfees or taxes, but argues that the 1977 version of that section did not contain an\nunambiguous waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity from state or local\ntaxes. The court agrees with the government.\n\n      For the reasons discussed by the court above, “it is well settled that, absent\nexpress congressional authorization, a State cannot tax the United States directly.”\nCotton Petroleum Corp. v.

To waive the\ngovernment’s sovereign immunity, Congress must express its intent to do so in\nterms that are unequivocal and unambiguous. See F.A.A. v.

Ct. at 1448 (“Legislative history cannot supply a waiver\nthat is not clearly evident from the language of the statute.”) (citation omitted).\nThe standards applicable to a waiver of sovereign immunity are not lowered simply\nbecause section 1323 purports to place the federal government on the same footing\nas private parties. Instead, “statutes placing the United States in the same position\nas a private party [must be] read narrowly to preserve certain immunities that the\nUnited States has enjoyed historically.” Library of Congress v.

First, the term is not defined in the statute, and dictionary definitions\ndo not support the County’s arguments here. See Black’s Law Dictionary 1491\n(9th ed. 2009) (defining a “service charge” as “[a] charge assessed for performing a\nservice, such as the charge assessed by a bank against the expenses of maintaining\nor servicing a customer’s checking account”). The definition of “service charge”\nmore closely corresponds with the definition of a fee, see id. at 690 (a “charge for\nlabor or services”), than with the definition of a tax, see id. at 1594 (a “charge, usu.\n\n                                          41\n\fmonetary, imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions, or\nproperty to yield public revenue”).\n\n        Second, the more circumscribed reading of the 1977 version of section 1323\n– i.e., that the term “reasonable service charges” includes fees but not taxes – is\nalso supported by the term that Congress actually used: reasonable service\ncharges. The Federal Facilities Section does not waive the government’s immunity\nfrom all “reasonable charges,” which might provide a somewhat more plausible\nbasis for concluding that the term includes taxes in addition to fees. Instead, the\nterm is qualified, and suggests that Congress intended to limit its waiver to fees\nthat were imposed in connection with the provision of a service. See id. at 1491\n(defining the term “service” as “[t]he act of doing something useful for a person or\na company, usu. for a fee”) (emphasis added).\n\n       The Supreme Court has explained that a statute purporting to waive the\ngovernment’s immunity is ambiguous “if there is a plausible interpretation of the\nstatute that would not authorize money damages against the Government.”\nCooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448. Here, there is at least one plausible interpretation of\nsection 1323 that would not authorize the damages the County seeks in this case:\nthat section 1323 waives the government’s immunity from fees but not from taxes.\nSection 1323, as it existed before January 2011, could be interpreted to waive the\ngovernment’s immunity from both regulatory fees, such as the fees charged to\nprocess a permit application, and user fees, such as fees charged for the provision\nof water or the disposal and treatment of sanitary sewage. On the other hand,\nsection 1323 need not be read to waive the government’s sovereign immunity from\nstate or local taxes, such as the stormwater management charges at issue in this\ncase. When faced with two plausible readings of a waiver of sovereign immunity,\none broad in scope and one narrow, the court must interpret the statute narrowly.\nLumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v.

In fact, amici appear to concede that the 1977 version of the\nstatute is not amenable to a broader construction. See Tr. at 65-66 (“I don’t think\nyou can read [the 1977 version of section 1323] to say that Congress waived\n\n                                           42\n\f[sovereign immunity] for something that would meet the test of a tax.”). In any\ncase, the County and amici argue that Congress passed the 2011 amendment to\nclarify the intended meaning of section 1323. For that reason, the County and\namici contend that section 1323 must be read as if it had always been so clarified.\n\n             3.

In support of that argument, amici\ncite the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in\nPiamba Cortes v.

There,\nthe court held that an amendment will be viewed as a clarification of an earlier\nstatute when: (1) the language of the earlier statute was ambiguous and in need of\nclarification; and (2) Congress has declared its intent to clarify the earlier statute.\nId. at 1283-84. In their brief, amici also reference the Ninth Circuit’s decision in\nUnited States v. Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705966\"><a href=\"/opinion/705966/95-cal-daily-op-serv-7820-95-daily-journal-dar-13443-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 856 (9th Cir. 1995), which explained that\n“when an amendment is a clarification, rather than an alteration, of existing law,\nthen it should be used in interpreting the provision in question retroactively.”\nIn its reply in support of its motion for summary judgment, the County adopts the\nclarification argument advanced by amici. Unfortunately for the County, the\nstandard set forth in Piamba Cortes is fundamentally inconsistent with the\nstandards for a waiver of sovereign immunity.\n\n       In normal circumstances, when a waiver of sovereign immunity is not\ninvolved, a court can discern the meaning of ambiguous statutory language by\nreference to extrinsic evidence of congressional intent. However, such evidence is\ngenerally limited to legislative history that preceded the enactment of the statute.\nSee, e.g., Ogilvie v.

In Piamba Cortes,\nhowever, the Eleventh Circuit explained that the usual concerns about retroactive\napplication of a statutory amendment are not implicated when the amendment\nmerely clarifies prior law rather than effecting a substantive change in the law.\n177 F.3d at 1283. For that reason, an amendment that does nothing more than\nclarify existing law may be given retroactive effect even in the absence of a clear\nstatement from Congress indicating that the amendment is to be applied\nretroactively.\n\n       In contrast to most statutes, however, a waiver of sovereign immunity must\nbe expressed in clear and unambiguous terms, and any ambiguities contained in the\nstatute must be resolved in favor of immunity. See Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448.\nFurther, a court may not examine legislative history or any other type of extrinsic\nevidence of congressional intent in interpreting the scope of the waiver. See id.\nRather, any waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed in\nstatutory text and will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the\nsovereign.” Lumbermens, 654 F.3d at 1311 (emphasis added). For that reason, it\ndoes not appear that Congress could ever clarify the scope of an earlier waiver of\nsovereign immunity under Piamba Cortes because a statute may be clarified only if\nit is ambiguous, while a statute can effect a waiver of sovereign immunity only if it\nis unambiguous. Here, the court has already determined that the 1977 version of\nsection 1323 did not contain a clear, unambiguous waiver of the government’s\nsovereign immunity from taxes. Because the earlier version of section 1323 was\nambiguous with respect to whether it waived the government’s immunity from\ntaxes, there was no effective waiver from taxes in 1977 that could have been later\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\fclarified in 2011.23\n\n       The court disagrees with the contrary conclusion of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington in United States v. Renton,\nNo. C11-1156, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1903429</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (W.D. Wash. May 25, 2012). In that case, the\ndistrict court concluded that the government was liable to two municipalities for\nstormwater charges assessed against federal property in years prior to the adoption\nof the 2011 amendment to section 1323. The district court first held that the 1977\nversion of that section contained an unambiguous waiver of the government’s\nimmunity from “reasonable service charges.” Next, the court determined, based\nlargely on legislative history, that the 2011 amendment was not a new waiver of\nsovereign immunity, but was instead a mere clarification of the earlier version of\nsection 1323. Finally, because it held that the 2011 amendment clarified the earlier\nversion of the statute, the court concluded that traditional canons of statutory\nconstruction required the amendment to be given retroactive effect. There are at\nleast two problems with the district court’s analysis.\n\n       First, while the district court properly held that the 1977 version of section\n1323 contained an unambiguous waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity\nfrom “reasonable service charges,” it failed to appreciate that the scope of the\ndisputed term was, in fact, ambiguous. As discussed above, there are at least two\nplausible interpretations of the term “reasonable service charges”: first, that the\nterm encompasses both fees and taxes, and, in the alternative, that the term is\nlimited to fees alone. Because ambiguities must be resolved in favor of immunity,\nthe district court should have concluded that the 1977 version of section 1323,\nprior to its amendment in 2011, did not waive the government’s sovereign\nimmunity from state and local taxation. Instead, the district court adopted the more\nexpansive interpretation of section 1323 and, based on that faulty premise, held\nthat the 2011 amendment was nothing more than a clarification of a pre-existing\nwaiver of immunity from taxes. See Lumbermens, 654 F.3d at 1311 (explaining\n\n\n       23\n         / In effect, the County is caught in a catch-22 of sorts, caused by the incompatibility of\nthe Piamba Cortes test with the exceedingly high and rigid standards that are applied to any\nwaiver of sovereign immunity. The court cannot view the 2011 amendment as a clarification\nwith retroactive effect unless the 1977 version of section 1323 was ambiguous in its scope.\nHowever, if the earlier version of section 1323 was in fact ambiguous, then the 2011 amendment\ncannot have retroactive effect because Congress did not waive the government’s immunity from\ntaxes by using clear and unambiguous language in 1977.\n\n                                                45\n\fthat a waiver of sovereign immunity must be “unequivocally expressed in statutory\ntext and will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign”)\n(citation and quotations omitted).\n\n       Finally, because it determined that the 2011 amendment was a clarification\nof an existing waiver, rather than a new waiver of immunity, the district court\nplaced extensive weight on the legislative history of that amendment. However, as\nnoted above, the 1977 version of section 1323 did not contain an unambiguous\nwaiver of immunity from state and local taxes, so the 2011 amendment must be\ninterpreted as a new waiver of sovereign immunity, the limitations of which were\nto be determined solely with reference to its express language. For that reason, the\ndistrict court was not permitted to turn to the legislative history of the 2011\namendment in discerning its meaning. See Cooper, 132 S. Ct. at 1448\n(“Legislative history cannot supply a waiver that is not clearly evident from the\nlanguage of the statute.”); Lane, 518 U.S. at 192 (“A statute’s legislative history\ncannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text.”).\n\n       In summary, because the 1977 version of section 1323 did not clearly waive\nthe government’s immunity from state or local taxes, the 2011 amendment to that\nsection must be treated as a new waiver of the government’s sovereign immunity.\nThe amendment cannot be treated as a clarification of an earlier waiver because\nsuch treatment would expand the waiver beyond the unambiguous language of\nsection 1323 as it existed before the date of the amendment. This court cannot\napply the new waiver contained in the 2011 amendment retroactively unless\nCongress expressly stated its intent to give the amendment retroactive effect.\nNeither the County nor amici argue that the amendment contains a new waiver of\nimmunity that Congress intended to have retroactive effect, and the court does not\ndiscern any such intent in either the text or the history of the 2011 amendment.24\n\n       24\n          / The County and amici do not argue that the amendment contained a new waiver of\nsovereign immunity that Congress intended to have retroactive effect.

In accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that:\n\n               (1)    Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, filed February 27, 2012, is\n                      GRANTED;\n\n               (2)    Plaintiff’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, filed\n                      April 30, 2012, is DENIED;\n\n               (3)    The Clerk’s Office is directed to ENTER final judgment in\n                      favor of defendant, DISMISSING the complaint as follows:\n\n                      (a)     The claims related to stormwater utility charges billed to\n                              defendant before November 14, 2005, shall be dismissed\n                              under RCFC 12(b)(1), without prejudice; and\n\n                      (b)     The remaining claims in the complaint shall be dismissed\n                              under RCFC 12(b)(6), with prejudice.\n\n               (4)    No costs.\n\n\n\n\nthe amendment simply states that federal agencies are responsible for stormwater charges under\nsection 1323, without regard to whether they are called fees or taxes. For that reason, the court\nmay not apply the 2011 amendment retroactively to permit the County to recover the charges it\nseeks to collect in this case.\n\n                                                47\n\f     /s/Lynn J.
