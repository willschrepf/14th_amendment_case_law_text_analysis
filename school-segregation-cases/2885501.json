Clark, III, Esquire\nOffice of United States Attorney\n970 Broad Street, Room 700\nNewark, New Jersey 07102\n       Attorney for Appellees\n\n\n                OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\n\n\n                              3\n\fPER CURIAM.\n\n       Osama Abdelfattah appeals pro se from an order of the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey\ngranting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment in this\naction brought under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”),\n5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Privacy Act (“PA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552a.\nWe will affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the District\nCourt for further proceedings. In doing so, we clarify the test,\nannounced in Davin v. United States Department of Justice, 60\nF.3d 1043, 1056 (3d Cir. 1995), for evaluating whether material\nwithheld pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7 qualifies as “records or\ninformation compiled for law enforcement purposes.”\n                                I.\n       In an effort to obtain records pertaining to himself,\nAbdelfattah submitted FOIA/PA requests to the United States\nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“CIS”), the Bureau of\nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), the\nBureau of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(“ICE”), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”). The\nCIS conducted a search using Abdelfattah’s name and located\n420 pages of responsive documents. Ultimately, the CIS\nreferred 57 pages to the ICE, released 344 pages in full, released\none page with redactions, and withheld 18 pages in full. Of the\n57 pages referred to the ICE, 51 were released in full, four were\nwithheld in part, and two were withheld in their entirety. When\nAbdelfattah filed his complaint against the ICE, that agency had\n\n\n                                4\n\fnot yet responded to the request submitted directly to it. In\nresponse to Abdelfattah’s request to the CBP, two pages were\ndetermined to be non-responsive and one document was\nreleased with certain redactions. The FBI informed Abdelfattah\nthat a search of its automated indices yielded no responsive\nrecords at its headquarters.\n       Beginning in October 2005, Abdelfattah filed a series of\ncomplaints in the District Court alleging that his FOIA requests\nwere not timely processed, that the searches were inadequate,\nand that certain information in the responsive documents was\nimproperly withheld.        These actions were eventually\nconsolidated and the parties filed cross motions for summary\njudgment. The District Court granted the defendants’ motion.1\n\n   1\n    The District Court did, however, deny that portion of the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment which requested that\nthe proceedings be stayed pursuant to Open America v.\nWatergate Special Prosecution Force, 547 F.2d 605 (D.C. Cir.\n1976), to permit the ICE to complete its processing of\nAbdelfattah’s pending FOIA request. The District Court\nconcluded that the ICE’s backlog of pending requests did not\namount to “exceptional circumstances,” and ordered the ICE to\nrespond to the FOIA/PA request within 20 days. 5 U.S.C. §\n552(a)(6)(C)(i)-(iii) (permitting a stay if it can be shown that\n“exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is\nexercising due diligence in responding to the request.”). The\nICE has complied with this order, and there is no indication that\nAbdelfattah challenged the response.\n\n                               5\n\fAbdelfattah appeals.\n                               II.\n        We employ a two-tiered test in reviewing an order of a\nDistrict Court granting summary judgment in proceedings\nseeking disclosure under the FOIA. We must “first decide\nwhether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its\ndetermination.” McDonnell v. United States, 4 F.3d 1227, 1242\n(3d Cir. 1993) (citations omitted). If it did, we “must then\ndecide whether that determination was clearly erroneous.” Id.\n(citations omitted). Under this standard, we will reverse only “if\nthe findings are unsupported by substantial evidence, lack\nadequate evidentiary support in the record, are against the clear\nweight of the evidence or where the district court has\nmisapprehended the weight of the evidence.” Id. (quoting Lame\nv. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 767 F.2d 66, 70 (3d Cir. 1985)).\n                               III.\n       On appeal, Abdelfattah challenges the adequacy of the\nsearches and the sufficiency of the justifications for withholding\nmaterial pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 5 and 7. See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(5) & (b)(7). He also challenges the degree of\ncompliance with the FOIA’s requirement that “[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided . . . after\ndeletion of the portions which are exempt . . . .” 5 U.S.C. §\n552(b).\n                               A.\n\n\n                                6\n\f         Under the FOIA, an agency has a duty to conduct a\nreasonable search for responsive records. See Oglesby v. U.S.\nDepartment of Army, 920 F.2d 57, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1990). The\nrelevant inquiry is not “whether there might exist any other\ndocuments possibly responsive to the request, but rather whether\nthe search for those documents was adequate.” Weisberg v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Justice, 745 F.2d 1476, 1485 (D.C. Cir. 1984). To\ndemonstrate the adequacy of its search, the agency should\nprovide a “reasonably detailed affidavit, setting forth the search\nterms and the type of search performed, and averring that all\nfiles likely to contain responsive materials . . . were searched.”\nValencia-Lucena v. U.S. Coast Guard, 180 F.3d 321, 326 (D.C.\nCir. 1999) (quoting Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68).\n        Abdelfattah alleges the CIS’s search was inadequate\nbecause it failed to produce records pertaining to his\napplications for relief (e.g., application for adjustment of status,\napplication for a travel document, application for employment\nauthorization, etc.). The District Court concluded that the\ndetailed affidavits in this case establish that the CIS’s search\nwas adequate and “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\ndocuments.” Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. We agree. In particular,\nthe affidavit of a paralegal specialist in the CIS FOIA/PA Unit\nat the National Records Center described Abdelfattah’s\nnumerous requests (including the specific file numbers assigned\nto the relief applications he sought), explained the search terms\nthat were employed, and described the various files that were\nsearched. Among those files was the “Computer Linked\nApplication Information Management System,” which is “used\n\n                                 7\n\fto track applications or petitions for benefits filed under the\nImmigration and Nationality Act.”\n        Abdelfattah further complains the FBI failed to\ndemonstrate the adequacy of its search.2 In October 2005,\nAbdelfattah submitted a FOIA/PA request to the FBI. The FBI\ninformed him that a search of its automated indices to its central\nrecords system files at its headquarters located no responsive\nrecords.     After exhausting his administrative remedies,\nAbdelfattah filed a complaint challenging the adequacy of the\nFBI’s search, asserting that records must exist because he had\nbeen interviewed by FBI agents in July 2004. The FBI did not\nsubmit an affidavit describing its search. See Valencia-Lucena,\n180 F.3d at 326 (describing information necessary to\ndemonstrate adequacy of search). The District Court thus had\nno factual basis for its determination that the “FBI has satisfied\nits FOIA obligations to Plaintiff.” See McDonnell, 4 F.3d at\n1242. Accordingly, we will remand for further proceedings on\nthis issue. Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 79 F.3d 1172, 1185-\n87 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (remanding where agencies failed to justify\nthe adequacy of their searches).\n                               B.\n        Abdelfattah further contends the declarations and Vaughn\n\n    2\n     To the extent that Abdelfattah contends that the FBI is\nwithholding six documents that were referred to it by the CIS,\nthe District Court correctly concluded that no such referral was\nmade.\n\n                                8\n\findex3 submitted by the defendants in support of their motion for\nsummary judgment were inadequate. Specifically, he claims\nthat those submissions (1) failed to adequately justify the ICE’s\nwithholding of a draft incident report pursuant to Exemption 5;\n(2) did not demonstrate that records located by the CIS and the\nCBP met the threshold for Exemption 7 that was established by\nthis Court in Davin;4 and (3) omitted any indication that the CIS\nhad disclosed all reasonably segregable information.\n\n\n       3\n      A Vaughn index is designed to “transform a potentially\nineffective, inquisitorial proceeding against an agency that\ncontrols information into a meaningful adversarial process” by\nidentifying each document withheld, the statutory exemption\nclaimed, and a particularized description of how each document\nwithheld falls within a statutory exemption. Coastal States Gas\nCorp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 644 F.2d 969, 984 (3d Cir. 1981); see\nalso Vaughn v. Rosen, 484 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973). The\njustification for withholding provided by the agency in a\nVaughn index may take any form as long as the agency offers a\n“reasonable basis to evaluate [it]s claim of privilege.” Gallant\nv. NLRB, 26 F.3d 168, 172-73 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (quoting\nDelaney, Migdall & Young, Chartered v. IRS, 826 F.2d 124,\n128 (D.C. Cir. 1987)).\n   4\n    Because the CBP has indicated that the page from which it\nredacted material is “substantially similar” to a page withheld by\nthe CIS, we will not separately examine the CBP’s response to\nAbdelfattah’s FOIA/PA request.\n\n                                9\n\f                                1.\n        After reviewing the record in its entirety, including the\nICE’s affidavit, we conclude that the District Court possessed a\nsufficient factual basis for its determination that the ICE\nproperly used Exemption 5 to withhold a draft incident report.\nExemption 5 protects from disclosure “inter-agency or\nintra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be\navailable by law to a party . . . in litigation with the agency.” 5\nU.S.C. § 552(b)(5). The Exemption encompasses the traditional\ndiscovery privileges, including the deliberative process\nprivilege, which “protects agency documents that are both\npredecisional and deliberative.” Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA,\n449 F.3d 141, 151 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see also Klamath Water\nUsers Protective Ass’n, 532 U.S. 1, 8 (2001). The ICE indicated\nthat the draft report involved discussions “between [the\nagency’s] subordinates and seniors” and noted that the report\n“may have been modified to ensure accurate reporting and\nclarify misleading statements.” Moreover, there is no indication\nin the record that the draft report was expressly adopted as, or\nincorporated by reference into, the ICE’s final decision. See\nNLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 161 (1975)\n(holding that “if an agency chooses expressly to adopt or\nincorporate by reference an intra-agency memorandum\npreviously covered by Exemption 5 in what would otherwise be\na final opinion, that memorandum may be withheld only on the\nground that it falls within the coverage of some exemption other\nthan Exemption 5.”).\n\n\n                                10\n\f                                2.\n        Abdelfattah also contends the CIS failed to sufficiently\njustify its use of Exemption 7. Under the present version of\nExemption 7, which was enacted in 1986, agencies may\nwithhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes” to the extent that disclosure threatens (to varying\ndegrees of certainty) one of six enumerated harms. See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7). With respect to the first part of this analysis –\nwhether the record or information was compiled for law\nenforcement purposes – this Court has stated that a criminal law\nenforcement agency must first “identify a particular individual\nor incident as the object of the investigation and specify the\nconnection of the individual or incident to a potential violation\nof law or security risk.” Then the agency must “demonstrate\nthat this relationship is based upon information sufficient to\nsupport at least a ‘colorable claim’ of its rationality.” Davin, 60\nF.3d at 1056 (internal quotation omitted).\n       This test is “an adaptation of the two-prong ‘rational\nnexus’ test articulated by the Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia Circuit” in Pratt v. Webster, 673 F.2d 408 (D.C.\nCir. 1982).5 Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056. When Pratt was decided\n\n\n   5\n     The Pratt test asks (1) whether the agency’s investigatory\nactivities that give rise to the documents sought are related to the\nenforcement of federal laws or to the maintenance of national\nsecurity; and (2) whether the nexus between the investigation\nand one of the agency’s law enforcement duties is based on\n\n                                11\n\fin 1982, Exemption 7 protected “investigatory record[s]\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.” But amendments to\nthe FOIA in 1986 modified the Exemption 7 threshold\nrequirement by deleting the word “investigatory” and inserting\nthe words “or information,” so that protection is now available\nto all “records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes.” Thus, while the 1986 FOIA amendments did not\naffect that portion of the Pratt test which requires a “nexus”\nbetween the agency activity giving rise to the records and its law\nenforcement duties, see Davin, 60 F.3d at 1055, the amendments\ndid broaden the sweep of the exemption’s coverage. See Tax\nAnalysts v. IRS, 294 F.3d 71, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (explaining\nthat 1986 FOIA amendments permitted wider application of\nExemption 7 by deleting “any requirement” that information be\ninvestigatory); see also Keys v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 830 F.2d\n337, 340 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n       Thus, we are faced with a statute which protects all\n“records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes,” and a test set forth in Davin under that statute which\nappears to impose on the government additional requirements\nfor withholding, namely, identification of a particular individual\nor incident, an investigation, and a potential violation of law or\nsecurity risk. In the present case, Abdelfattah requested\ninformation pertaining to himself that is maintained by the CIS,\nan agency that is responsible for performing various\n\n\ninformation sufficient to support at least a colorable claim of\nrationality. Pratt, 673 F.2d at 420-21.\n\n                               12\n\fimmigration adjudications (e.g., visa petitions and asylum\napplications). See 6 U.S.C. § 271(b) (setting forth functions of\nthe CIS). Under Davin, any records maintained by the CIS\nconcerning Abdelfattah’s applications for immigration relief\narguably would not be covered by Exemption 7 because they do\nnot relate to an “investigation” or a “potential violation of law.”\n        Importantly, however, we interpret as dicta that portion\nof the Davin test which refers to the identification of a particular\nindividual or incident as the object of an investigation into a\npotential violation of law or security risk. In Davin, the\nrequester sought from the FBI records pertaining to a national\nunion for the unemployed and its one-time leader. With respect\nto Exemption 7, the Davin Court was concerned primarily with\nwhether it should adopt a per se rule “under which all records\ncompiled by law enforcement agencies . . . qualify as ‘records\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes’” or whether it should\nrequire the agency to establish a rational nexus between the\nactivities giving rise to the requested records and its law\nenforcement duties. Davin, 60 F.3d at 1054-56. Adoption of a\nper se rule in Davin would have resulted in a conclusion that the\nrecords requested from the FBI, which is a law enforcement\nagency, fell within Exemption 7’s threshold. Instead, however,\nthe Davin Court chose to apply the rational nexus test, thereby\nrequiring the FBI to articulate a connection between the\nresponsive documents and a legitimate law enforcement\nconcern. Id. at 1056-57. Therefore, rejection of the per se rule\nand application of the rational nexus test dictated the result in\nDavin. By contrast, the Davin Court was not presented with the\n\n                                13\n\fquestion whether the proper invocation of Exemption 7\ndepended on the presence of an investigation because it was\nclear that an investigation had given rise to the responsive\ndocuments. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056. Accordingly, because\nthe investigation requirement of the Davin test “could have been\ndeleted without seriously impairing the analytical foundations\nof the holding,” the requirement is dicta. In re McDonald, 205\nF.3d 606, 612 (3rd Cir. 2000) (quoting Sarnoff v. American\nHome Prods. Corp., 798 F.2d 1075, 1084 (7th Cir. 1986)); Cf.\nUnited States v. Luiz, 102 F.3d 466, 469 (11th Cir. 1996)\n(holding that first requirement of three-part test was dicta\nbecause, under the facts of the case announcing the test, the first\nrequirement had been met). While “[i]t is the tradition of this\ncourt that the holding of a panel in a precedential opinion is\nbinding on subsequent panels,” Internal Operating Procedure\n9.1, it is also well established that we are not bound by dictum\nin an earlier opinion. See Mariana v. Fisher, 338 F.3d 189, 201\n(3d Cir. 2003).\n       As noted, the 1986 FOIA amendments broadened the\napplicability of Exemption 7 by expressly removing the\nrequirement that the records be “investigatory.” See Tax\nAnalysts, 294 F.3d at 79 (noting that “legislative history [of the\n1986 FOIA amendments] makes it clear that Congress intended\nthe amended exemption to protect both investigatory and\nnon-investigatory materials”). Thus, under the plain language\nof the statute, we conclude that an agency seeking to invoke\nExemption 7 does not have to identify a particular individual or\nincident as the object of an investigation into a potential\n\n                                14\n\fviolation of law or security risk. See Keys, 830 F.2d at 340\n(stating that “Pratt requires simply that the nexus between the\nagency’s activity (under the old scheme, an ‘investigation’) and\nits law enforcement duties must be based on information\nsufficient to support at least a colorable claim of its rationality”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); North v. Walsh, 881 F.2d\n1088, 1098 n.14 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (stating that “Congress also\nchanged the threshold requirement for withholding information\nunder exemption 7: the exemption formerly covered\n‘investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes’;\nit now applies more broadly to ‘records or information compiled\nfor law enforcement purposes.’”). Our research has not\ndisclosed any contrary appellate decisions.\n        We emphasize, however, that Exemption 7 still requires\nan agency to demonstrate that the relationship between its\nauthority to enforce a statute or regulation and the activity\ngiving rise to the requested documents is based upon\ninformation sufficient to support at least a colorable claim of the\nrelationship’s rationality. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056.\n“[S]imple recitation of statutes, orders and public laws is an\ninsufficient showing of a rational nexus to a legitimate law\nenforcement concern.” Id. In this case, the CIS has not\nidentified any connection between its law enforcement authority\nand the information contained in the withheld material. Indeed,\nin describing the “Reason for Withholding,” the CIS’s Vaughn\nindex merely notes that the documents were “compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” without providing any further detail or\nexplanation. While the descriptions of some of the withheld\n\n                                 15\n\fdocuments arguably suggest that they were compiled for law\nenforcement purposes, we will not extrapolate such a purpose\nsolely based on those brief summaries or on the CIS’s\ndescription of the databases that it searched.6 See Church of\nScientology of California v. U.S. Dep’t of Army, 611 F.2d 738,\n749 (9th Cir. 1979) (remanding where agency provided\ninsufficient evidence to justify use of Exemption 7).\n                               3.\n       Notably, even if the CIS’s application of FOIA\nexemptions was substantively correct, we would nevertheless\nremand because the CIS failed to demonstrate that it has\nreleased all reasonably segregable portions of each withheld\ndocument. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (requiring that “[a]ny reasonably\n\n\n     6\n      According to the CIS, it searched “a computer system\ndesigned to track the location of receipts and alien files within\ndesignated offices,” “a computer system used to track\napplications or petitions for benefits filed under the Immigration\nand Nationality Act,” and a system that “provides automated\ninformation regarding certain classes of aliens and identifies the\nlocation of an alien’s hardcopy A-file.” The withheld\ninformation consisted of seven “Facsimile Transmittal [or\nConfirmation] Cover Sheets,” two “record check report[s],” two\nmemoranda (including one regarding an “investigation”), two\nemails, one “record of IBIS query,” one “NAIL lookout\ncontact/comments ADD,” and a three-page “TECS II Person\nSubject Display.”\n\n                               16\n\fsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person\nrequesting such record after deletion of the portions which are\nexempt”). An “agency cannot justify withholding an entire\ndocument simply by showing that it contains some exempt\nmaterial.” Mead Data Central v. U.S. Dep’t of Air Force, 566\nF.2d 242, 260 (D.C. Cir. 1977). Rather, the agency must\ndemonstrate that all reasonably segregable, nonexempt\ninformation was released. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1052 (“The\nstatements regarding segregability are wholly conclusory,\nproviding no information that would enable [plaintiff] to\nevaluate the FBI’s decisions to withhold.”). The CIS’s\ndeclarations and Vaughn index provided no basis for the District\nCourt to make a “reasonably segregable” finding. Indeed, there\nis no description of the agency’s process for making such a\ndetermination, no factual recitation of why certain materials are\nnot reasonably segregable, and no indication of “what\nproportion of the information in a document is non-exempt and\nhow that material is dispersed throughout the document.” Mead\nData Central, 566 F.2d at 261. The absence of this information\nnecessitates a remand to the District Court to make a specific\nsegregability finding with respect to the CIS. See Kimberlin v.\nDep’t of Justice, 139 F.3d 944, 950 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (remanding\nbecause District Court did not make findings regarding\nsegregability).\n                              IV.\n        For the foregoing reasons we will affirm in part, vacate\nin part, and remand the matter to the District Court for further\n\n\n                               17\n\fproceedings consistent with this opinion. In particular, we will\nvacate that portion of the District Court’s order which granted\nsummary judgment concerning the FBI’s search for responsive\ndocuments, the applicability of Exemption 7 to records withheld\nby the CIS, and the CIS’s satisfaction of its obligation to\ndemonstrate that all reasonably segregable information has been\ndisclosed. In all other respects, we will affirm the judgment of\nthe District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                              18\n\f",

The\nCIS conducted a search using Abdelfattah’s name and located\n420 pages of responsive documents. Ultimately, the CIS\nreferred 57 pages to the ICE, released 344 pages in full, released\none page with redactions, and withheld 18 pages in full. Of the\n57 pages referred to the ICE, 51 were released in full, four were\nwithheld in part, and two were withheld in their entirety. When\nAbdelfattah filed his complaint against the ICE, that agency had\n\n\n                                4\n\fnot yet responded to the request submitted directly to it. In\nresponse to Abdelfattah’s request to the CBP, two pages were\ndetermined to be non-responsive and one document was\nreleased with certain redactions. The FBI informed Abdelfattah\nthat a search of its automated indices yielded no responsive\nrecords at its headquarters.\n       Beginning in October 2005, Abdelfattah filed a series of\ncomplaints in the District Court alleging that his FOIA requests\nwere not timely processed, that the searches were inadequate,\nand that certain information in the responsive documents was\nimproperly withheld.        These actions were eventually\nconsolidated and the parties filed cross motions for summary\njudgment. The District Court granted the defendants’ motion.1\n\n   1\n    The District Court did, however, deny that portion of the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment which requested that\nthe proceedings be stayed pursuant to Open America v.\nWatergate Special Prosecution Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"341743\"><a href=\"/opinion/341743/open-america-v-the-watergate-special-prosecution-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.

See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(5) & (b)(7).

The District Court concluded that the\ndetailed affidavits in this case establish that the CIS’s search\nwas adequate and “reasonably calculated to uncover all relevant\ndocuments.” Oglesby, 920 F.2d at 68. We agree. In particular,\nthe affidavit of a paralegal specialist in the CIS FOIA/PA Unit\nat the National Records Center described Abdelfattah’s\nnumerous requests (including the specific file numbers assigned\nto the relief applications he sought), explained the search terms\nthat were employed, and described the various files that were\nsearched. Among those files was the “Computer Linked\nApplication Information Management System,” which is “used\n\n                                 7\n\fto track applications or petitions for benefits filed under the\nImmigration and Nationality Act.”\n        Abdelfattah further complains the FBI failed to\ndemonstrate the adequacy of its search.2 In October 2005,\nAbdelfattah submitted a FOIA/PA request to the FBI. The FBI\ninformed him that a search of its automated indices to its central\nrecords system files at its headquarters located no responsive\nrecords.     After exhausting his administrative remedies,\nAbdelfattah filed a complaint challenging the adequacy of the\nFBI’s search, asserting that records must exist because he had\nbeen interviewed by FBI agents in July 2004. The FBI did not\nsubmit an affidavit describing its search. See Valencia-Lucena,\n180 F.3d at 326 (describing information necessary to\ndemonstrate adequacy of search). The District Court thus had\nno factual basis for its determination that the “FBI has satisfied\nits FOIA obligations to Plaintiff.” See McDonnell, 4 F.3d at\n1242.

Under the present version of\nExemption 7, which was enacted in 1986, agencies may\nwithhold “records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes” to the extent that disclosure threatens (to varying\ndegrees of certainty) one of six enumerated harms. See 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(b)(7). With respect to the first part of this analysis –\nwhether the record or information was compiled for law\nenforcement purposes – this Court has stated that a criminal law\nenforcement agency must first “identify a particular individual\nor incident as the object of the investigation and specify the\nconnection of the individual or incident to a potential violation\nof law or security risk.” Then the agency must “demonstrate\nthat this relationship is based upon information sufficient to\nsupport at least a ‘colorable claim’ of its rationality.” Davin, 60\nF.3d at 1056 (internal quotation omitted).\n       This test is “an adaptation of the two-prong ‘rational\nnexus’ test articulated by the Court of Appeals for the District\nof Columbia Circuit” in Pratt v. Webster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCir. 1982).5 Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056. When Pratt was decided\n\n\n   5\n     The Pratt test asks (1) whether the agency’s investigatory\nactivities that give rise to the documents sought are related to the\nenforcement of federal laws or to the maintenance of national\nsecurity; and (2) whether the nexus between the investigation\nand one of the agency’s law enforcement duties is based on\n\n                                11\n\fin 1982, Exemption 7 protected “investigatory record[s]\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes.” But amendments to\nthe FOIA in 1986 modified the Exemption 7 threshold\nrequirement by deleting the word “investigatory” and inserting\nthe words “or information,” so that protection is now available\nto all “records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes.” Thus, while the 1986 FOIA amendments did not\naffect that portion of the Pratt test which requires a “nexus”\nbetween the agency activity giving rise to the records and its law\nenforcement duties, see Davin, 60 F.3d at 1055, the amendments\ndid broaden the sweep of the exemption’s coverage. See Tax\nAnalysts v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778068\"><a href=\"/opinion/778068/tax-analysts-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (explaining\nthat 1986 FOIA amendments permitted wider application of\nExemption 7 by deleting “any requirement” that information be\ninvestigatory); see also Keys v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495212\"><a href=\"/opinion/495212/arthur-b-keys-jr-v-united-states-department-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">830</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 340 (D.C. Cir. 1987).\n       Thus, we are faced with a statute which protects all\n“records or information compiled for law enforcement\npurposes,” and a test set forth in Davin under that statute which\nappears to impose on the government additional requirements\nfor withholding, namely, identification of a particular individual\nor incident, an investigation, and a potential violation of law or\nsecurity risk. In the present case, Abdelfattah requested\ninformation pertaining to himself that is maintained by the CIS,\nan agency that is responsible for performing various\n\n\ninformation sufficient to support at least a colorable claim of\nrationality. Pratt, 673 F.2d at 420-21.\n\n                               12\n\fimmigration adjudications (e.g., visa petitions and asylum\napplications). See 6 U.S.C. § 271(b) (setting forth functions of\nthe CIS). Under Davin, any records maintained by the CIS\nconcerning Abdelfattah’s applications for immigration relief\narguably would not be covered by Exemption 7 because they do\nnot relate to an “investigation” or a “potential violation of law.”\n        Importantly, however, we interpret as dicta that portion\nof the Davin test which refers to the identification of a particular\nindividual or incident as the object of an investigation into a\npotential violation of law or security risk. In Davin, the\nrequester sought from the FBI records pertaining to a national\nunion for the unemployed and its one-time leader. With respect\nto Exemption 7, the Davin Court was concerned primarily with\nwhether it should adopt a per se rule “under which all records\ncompiled by law enforcement agencies . . . qualify as ‘records\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes’” or whether it should\nrequire the agency to establish a rational nexus between the\nactivities giving rise to the requested records and its law\nenforcement duties. Davin, 60 F.3d at 1054-56. Adoption of a\nper se rule in Davin would have resulted in a conclusion that the\nrecords requested from the FBI, which is a law enforcement\nagency, fell within Exemption 7’s threshold. Instead, however,\nthe Davin Court chose to apply the rational nexus test, thereby\nrequiring the FBI to articulate a connection between the\nresponsive documents and a legitimate law enforcement\nconcern. Id. at 1056-57. Therefore, rejection of the per se rule\nand application of the rational nexus test dictated the result in\nDavin. By contrast, the Davin Court was not presented with the\n\n                                13\n\fquestion whether the proper invocation of Exemption 7\ndepended on the presence of an investigation because it was\nclear that an investigation had given rise to the responsive\ndocuments. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056. Accordingly, because\nthe investigation requirement of the Davin test “could have been\ndeleted without seriously impairing the analytical foundations\nof the holding,” the requirement is dicta.

Thus, under the plain language\nof the statute, we conclude that an agency seeking to invoke\nExemption 7 does not have to identify a particular individual or\nincident as the object of an investigation into a potential\n\n                                14\n\fviolation of law or security risk. See Keys, 830 F.2d at 340\n(stating that “Pratt requires simply that the nexus between the\nagency’s activity (under the old scheme, an ‘investigation’) and\nits law enforcement duties must be based on information\nsufficient to support at least a colorable claim of its rationality”)\n(internal quotation marks omitted); North v.

Our research has not\ndisclosed any contrary appellate decisions.\n        We emphasize, however, that Exemption 7 still requires\nan agency to demonstrate that the relationship between its\nauthority to enforce a statute or regulation and the activity\ngiving rise to the requested documents is based upon\ninformation sufficient to support at least a colorable claim of the\nrelationship’s rationality. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1056.\n“[S]imple recitation of statutes, orders and public laws is an\ninsufficient showing of a rational nexus to a legitimate law\nenforcement concern.” Id. In this case, the CIS has not\nidentified any connection between its law enforcement authority\nand the information contained in the withheld material. Indeed,\nin describing the “Reason for Withholding,” the CIS’s Vaughn\nindex merely notes that the documents were “compiled for law\nenforcement purposes” without providing any further detail or\nexplanation. While the descriptions of some of the withheld\n\n                                 15\n\fdocuments arguably suggest that they were compiled for law\nenforcement purposes, we will not extrapolate such a purpose\nsolely based on those brief summaries or on the CIS’s\ndescription of the databases that it searched.6 See Church of\nScientology of California v.

An “agency cannot justify withholding an entire\ndocument simply by showing that it contains some exempt\nmaterial.” Mead Data Central v.

Cir. 1977). Rather, the agency must\ndemonstrate that all reasonably segregable, nonexempt\ninformation was released. See Davin, 60 F.3d at 1052 (“The\nstatements regarding segregability are wholly conclusory,\nproviding no information that would enable [plaintiff] to\nevaluate the FBI’s decisions to withhold.”). The CIS’s\ndeclarations and Vaughn index provided no basis for the District\nCourt to make a “reasonably segregable” finding. Indeed, there\nis no description of the agency’s process for making such a\ndetermination, no factual recitation of why certain materials are\nnot reasonably segregable, and no indication of “what\nproportion of the information in a document is non-exempt and\nhow that material is dispersed throughout the document.” Mead\nData Central, 566 F.2d at 261. The absence of this information\nnecessitates a remand to the District Court to make a specific\nsegregability finding with respect to the CIS.
