OWEN, Circuit Judge:\n      Perry Allen Austin was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court\nand sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the\ntrial court’s judgment and subsequently dismissed Austin’s state habeas\npetition as untimely. Austin filed a federal habeas petition. The federal\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the State and denied a certificate\nof appealability (COA). This court granted Austin a COA on fourteen of his\ntwenty-one grounds. We now affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\f    Case: 13-70024         Document: 00514256173         Page: 2     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-70024\n                                               I\n      We briefly recount the pertinent facts leading up to Austin’s trial for\ncapital murder, as outlined in a prior opinion:\n             In 1978, [Austin] raped one of his adolescent sisters at gunpoint\n      and attempted to rape another, before robbing a third, older sister and\n      his mother. . . . A jury convicted Austin of rape, attempted rape, and\n      aggravated robbery.\n             Following this conviction, Austin was released on parole in 1991\n      and began a sexual relationship with J.O., a fourteen-year-old female.\n      Through J.O., Austin met D.K., a nine-year-old male. D.K. disappeared\n      in August 1992. While investigating D.K.’s disappearance, police\n      discovered Austin’s relationship with J.O. and charges were brought\n      against Austin. He pled guilty to sexual assault of a child and received\n      a thirty-year sentence. In April 1993, D.K.’s remains were found.\n      Although there was physical evidence connecting Austin to D.K.’s\n      murder and Austin admitted that D.K. had been in his vehicle the day of\n      D.K.’s disappearance, police did not believe they had sufficient evidence\n      to prove Austin was responsible for D.K.’s murder.\n             Austin alleges that prison conditions caused his mental health to\n      deteriorate after he was incarcerated for sexually assaulting J.O. In\n      1995, he stabbed another prisoner and received an additional twenty-\n      year sentence. By this point, Austin was confined in administrative\n      segregation.\n             In September 2000, Austin wrote a letter to a Houston police\n      officer, stating that he would confess to D.K.’s murder if he would be\n      guaranteed the death penalty. [Austin stated if that was not guaranteed,\n      he would kill a prison guard as a way of guaranteeing himself the death\n      penalty.] 1 Austin was interviewed at the state prison and confessed\n      orally and in writing to slitting D.K.’s throat with a knife because Austin\n      was angry at D.K.’s brother for allegedly stealing drugs from Austin’s\n      car. Austin was indicted for capital murder on February 15, 2001. On\n      March 21, Mack Arnold was appointed to represent Austin. 2\n\n\n\n\n      1   14RR24.\n      2   Austin v. Davis, 647 F.

I am fully competent\nand definitely know the difference between right and wrong.” 11 In his last\n\n\n      3 CR at 5 (letter from Austin to the trial court file stamped May 15, 2001).\n      4 Id.\n      5 Id.\n      6 Id.\n      7 CR at 16 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated July 19, 2001); ROA.629.\n      8 CR at 16; ROA.629.\n      9 CR at 16.\n      10 CR at 18 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Aug. 8, 2001).\n      11 Id.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f     Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173          Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\nletter to the state trial court before the pretrial hearing to determine if Austin\ncould represent himself, Austin again requested to proceed pro se, noting he\nwas “fully aware of the consequences” and “aware that this is within [his]\nright.” 12 He also stated that he did not wish to participate in jury selection and\nthat he would “not contest any juror the prosecution selects.” 13\n       Prior to trial, Austin’s counsel requested that the state trial court permit\nand authorize payment for a psychological examination of Austin by Dr.\nJerome Brown, a clinical psychologist. 14 The trial court granted counsel’s\nrequest, 15 although it appears that counsel did not immediately seek Dr.\nBrown’s services. 16 The trial court held a conference in chambers six weeks\nlater and explained to Austin that it wanted a psychological evaluation\nperformed before it could decide whether Austin could proceed pro se. 17 The\ntrial court ordered Dr. Brown to evaluate Austin to determine his competency\nto stand trial. 18 In his report, prepared after meeting with Austin, Dr. Brown\nnoted that Austin “had no trouble providing relevant and coherent background\ninformation,” was able to describe the charges against him and the court\nproceedings that had occurred, and could explain why he wanted to represent\nhimself. 19 Dr. Brown concluded that Austin was “alert, well-oriented, and able\nto communicate his ideas without difficulty.” 20 Dr. Brown also noted that\n\n\n       12 CR at 20 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Aug. 14, 2001).\n       13 Id.\n       14 CR at 12-13 (motion submitted May 30, 2001).\n       15 CR at 11 (granting motion on July 13, 2001).\n       16 2RR3 (trial court referring to a previous conference in chambers six weeks before in\n\nwhich it noted that the evaluation had not yet occurred); Austin Br. at 15 (specifying that the\nconference occurred on August 27, 2001).\n       17 2RR3-4.\n       18 CR at 24 (evaluation conducted on September 20, 2001).\n       19 CR at 24-25.\n       20 CR at 26.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173              Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\nAustin displayed no “bizarre verbalizations,” hallucinations, or delusions\ntypically indicative of severe mental illness nor did he exhibit any indication\nof   disorganization,       confusion,      or       other     significant   difficulties   in\ncommunication. 21 Although the report acknowledged Austin’s use of alcohol\nand drugs in prison, it did not otherwise mention any past mental health\nissues. 22 Dr. Brown concluded that Austin was competent to stand trial. 23\n       After the evaluation, the state trial court held a pretrial Faretta hearing\nto consider Austin’s request to proceed pro se. Under Faretta v. California, a\ncriminal defendant has a right to self-representation. 24 To exercise that right,\na defendant must competently, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to\ncounsel. 25 At the hearing, the trial court noted that it had read Austin’s letters\nand spoken with Austin at a prior hearing. 26 The trial court also noted that it\nwas in possession of Dr. Brown’s report summarizing his evaluation of Austin’s\ncompetency to stand trial. 27 The trial court asked Austin’s counsel his opinion\n\n\n\n       21  Id.\n       22  CR at 24-26.\n        23 CR at 26.\n        24 Faretta v.

Although a defendant need not himself have the skill and\nexperience of a lawyer in order competently and intelligently to choose self-representation,\nhe should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the\nrecord will establish that ‘he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.’”)\n(internal citations omitted); see also Weaver v.

Counsel stated that, in his view, Austin was\ncompetent to stand trial and, in fact, “it has been [his] opinion from the first\ntime [he] met him but out of an abundance of caution [he] requested the\npsychiatric evaluation.” 28 The court then asked Austin a series of questions\npertaining to his understanding of the possible consequences of representing\nhimself and of the charges against him. Austin explained that he wanted\ncomplete control over trial strategy, although he agreed to standby counsel\n“[f]or legal advice only.” 29 The court also asked Austin four questions about his\nmental health history. 30 Austin stated he had had no mental health issues. 31\nThe trial court issued findings, granted Austin’s request to proceed to trial pro\nse, and appointed standby counsel. 32\n      After the Faretta hearing, but before trial began, Austin submitted an\naffidavit to the state trial court, stating that he wished to have his court order\nfor access to the law library rescinded because he thought “it [was] not\nnecessary for [him] to attend additional [l]aw [l]ibrary sessions to research the\n\n\n\n\n      28 Id.\n      29 2RR13.\n      30 2RR6-7.\n      31 Id.\n\n             THE COURT: Have you ever been declared mentally incompetent?\n             AUSTIN: No, ma’am.\n             THE COURT: Have you ever been treated for any mental health disorder?\n             AUSTIN: No, ma’am.\n             ...\n             THE COURT: Okay.

[s]ince [he\nwas] not going to put up any type of defense.” 37\n      Austin did not participate in jury selection. 38 The trial court admonished\nprospective jurors during voir dire that if selected, each would be required to\n“render a verdict based on the law . . . not your personal opinion.” 39 Under\nTexas law, juries on capital cases must decide two special issues in the\nsentencing phase: (1) “whether there is a probability that the defendant would\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\nsociety,” and if so, (2) “[w]hether, taking into consideration all of the\nevidence . . . there is a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances to\nwarrant that a sentence of life imprisonment without parole rather than a\n\n\n\n\n      33  CR at 36 (affidavit sworn on Dec. 5, 2001).\n      34  CR at 60 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Dec. 30, 2001).\n       35 CR at 60-61. A handwritten note on the letter, which appears to be mistakenly\n\ndated January 25, 2001 instead of January 25, 2002, suggests that Austin later stated at a\nhearing in open court that he would accept Arnold as standby counsel at trial.\n       36 CR at 58 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Feb. 19, 2002).\n       37 Id.\n       38 See generally vol. 3-8 of Reporter’s Records (voir dire beginning Mar. 18, 2002).\n       39 3RR4.\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f     Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173         Page: 8     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\ndeath sentence be imposed.” 40 Each juror answered, under oath, that he or she\ncould impartially decide whether Austin should be sentenced to life\nimprisonment or death. 41         When empaneled, the jurors swore they would\nrender a verdict according to the law and evidence. 42\n       Austin pleaded guilty to capital murder. 43 Before accepting Austin’s\nplea, the trial court questioned Austin about his understanding of the charges\nagainst him and the possible penalties. 44            The court also probed whether\nAustin’s plea was voluntary. 45 Austin stated he understood and was entering\nhis plea voluntarily. 46 The court accepted the plea. 47 After the jury was sworn\nand admonished by the state trial court, the State presented the indictment\nand Austin entered his guilty plea before the jury. 48 The punishment phase of\nthe trial then proceeded. 49\n       During the punishment phase, the State provided additional details\nregarding the offense, including that D.K was nine years old when he was\nkilled. 50 It also introduced the letter Sergeant Allen received from Austin in\n\n\n\n       40 TEX.

I need to clear all\nthis up.” 55\n       In the second interview a year later, Austin again admitted to killing\nD.K., described why and how he committed the crime, and stated he confessed\n“[b]ecause [he] did it.” 56 When Sergeant Allen further inquired why Austin\ncame forward in 2001, Austin answered, “Depression I guess.” 57 Austin stated:\n       I couldn’t stop dreaming about it, I couldn’t stop seeing pictures of\n       it.

I regret something I did, I’m gonna pay for it[,] I’m not gonna make\nno excuses for nothing.” 61\n      Austin for the most part refrained from questioning witnesses and\npresenting evidence during the punishment phase. 62 He did not testify. 63 He\nbriefly cross-examined an F.B.I. agent about Austin’s relationship with J.O.,\nspecifically asking whether J.O.’s mother informed the agent that Austin used\nto date her before dating J.O. and whether J.O.’s mother told the agent that\nJ.O. looked old enough to drink in bars. 64 Austin made a closing statement,\n\n\n\n\n      58 Id.\n      59 ROA.853.\n      60 Id.\n      61 Id.\n      62 See generally Reporter’s Record vols. 9-11.\n      63 10RR78.\n      64 9RR125-26.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f   Case: 13-70024         Document: 00514256173    Page: 11   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 13-70024\ntelling the jury he was violent, mean, and sometimes thought he had no\nconscience. 65 He also stated:\n      I’ve been like this all my life, and I doubt if I’ll change. What I\n      wanted to say was they think I have a death wish. Well, that’s not\n      true. One of the reasons why I went ahead and confessed [to killing\n      D.K.] was it was bothering me, what I did. Regardless of what\n      everybody thinks, it does. I’ve never killed anybody before.\n      And, . . . I also knew that my acts of violence would not stop even\n      though I was in prison. 66\n\nHe referred to an incident in prison in which he had “come real close to killing\na [prison] guard” and that “[t]he only reason” he did not was that someone else\nstopped him. 67 He explained that “one of these days” there would not be\nsomeone to stop him, and he would “end up killing again.” 68 Austin contested\nat closing the State’s contention that he was a pedophile, asserting that J.O.\nlooked older than she was. 69 He stated he was homosexual and described his\nsexual preferences. 70 Austin concluded his closing, telling the jury:\n      On these special issues, there’s no doubt that you will answer yes\n      to No. 1 because if you send me to prison, I will commit further acts\n      of violence. . . . Jail is a violent place, especially for somebody like\n      me. I’m a homosexual. So, yes, I will commit further acts of\n      violence in prison. Special Issue No. 2, there was no mitigating\n      circumstances that contributed to killing [D.K.]. And fear, anger\n      or whatever can never be considered anywhere near a reason for\n      killing. So I suspect, you know, y’all, by law, have to answer that\n      number as no. 71\n\n\n\n      65 11RR15.\n      66 11RR15-16.\n      67 11RR16.\n      68 Id.\n      69 11RR16-17, 19.\n      70 11RR18.\n      71 11RR19-20.\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 13-70024      Document: 00514256173         Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\nThe jury answered Texas’s special issues such that the trial court imposed a\ndeath sentence. 72\n       The state trial court held a second Faretta hearing in which Austin\nwaived his right to both appellate counsel and state habeas counsel. 73 The\ncourt noted it had previously determined before trial that Austin was\ncompetent and it appointed standby appellate counsel. 74 Pursuant to Texas\nlaw, Austin’s case was automatically appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals (TCCA). 75 Austin filed no brief. The TCCA affirmed his conviction,\nnoting that Austin had chosen to represent himself at trial and on appeal and\nthat the “trial court [had] fully admonished [him] of the dangers and\ndisadvantages of self-representation prior to trial and prior to this appeal.” 76\nThe TCCA stated it had, in the interests of justice, reviewed the entire record\nand found no unassigned fundamental error. 77\n       Austin waived any pursuit of post-conviction relief and the trial court set\nAustin’s execution date. 78 Six days before his scheduled execution, Austin\nmoved to have state habeas counsel appointed. 79 The trial court withdrew the\nexecution date and appointed Dick Wheelan as habeas counsel on September\n24, 2003. 80\n\n\n\n\n       72 11RR31; CR at 78-79.\n       73 12RR3, 8; CR at 84-85.\n       74 CR at 86; ROA.22; ROA.595.\n       75 See TEX.

After his suicide attempt in 1975, he was\nhospitalized and diagnosed with adolescent adjustment reaction in a mixed\npersonality. 100 Austin subsequently joined the army but was discharged in\n1977 for “failure to adapt socially and emotionally.” 101                    Following the\naggravated rape of his sister and attempted aggravated rape of another of his\nsisters, as well as the aggravated robbery of a third sister and his mother in\n1978, 102 Austin was evaluated by a psychologist, Dr. Franklin Lewis, before\nthe trial occurred on those charges. 103 Dr. Lewis diagnosed Austin with severe\npersonality disturbance with schizoid thinking and anti-social features as well\nas latent borderline schizophrenia. 104 He concluded that Austin was, at the\ntime, suffering from a mental illness. 105 Austin pleaded not guilty due to\ninsanity. 106 At trial, Dr. Lewis testified that there were indications that Austin\nhad brain dysfunction or brain damage, although further testing would be\nrequired to make a determination. 107 Austin again attempted suicide in 1979\n\n\n       98  ROA.1930; ROA.2126.\n       99  See Second Amended Pet. at 13; ROA.607; ROA.610.\n        100 Second Amended Pet. at 14; ROA.607 (same assertion in first amended petition).\n        101 Second Amended Pet. at 15.\n        102 Pet.

Dr. McGarrahan concluded that Austin “has a chronic issue with\nsuicidal depression and that his suicidal depression appears to have been\npresent at the time of his trial and competency evaluation . . . and likely\nimpaired his ability to reason and make sound judgments.” 144 Dr. Woods\n\n\n        138 Pet.

He stated:\n      I wish to drop my appeals but can’t seem to get any type of response\n      nor cooperation. I have informed my attorney of my wishes and\n      according to him, to drop my appeals m[a]y actually prolong the\n      date of my execution because the courts would then request a\n      competency hearing. If there is any way I could waive the\n      compentency [sic] hearing I would gladly do it. I was given a\n      competency hearing just before my trial, and another just after,\n      but before my direct appeals by the trial court.

My TDCJ IQ score was 123\n      and my TDCJ EA Score was 12.9. Again, this is hardly a sign of\n      incompetence. I do have a history of mental health issues, but\n      nothing that can't be treated satisfactorily with medication and\n      counseling. I chose to abstain from medication and counseling\n      though and so see no reason why my mental health should keep\n      me from dropping my appeals. Also, I recently read a court case in\n      which your court ruled that a person could be mentally ill, but still\n      be competent to be executed because that person was competent\n      during their trial. In that case, that should also be the case in my\n      case/appeals. 149\n\nWe requested that the State and Austin’s counsel respond to Austin’s request\nto withdraw his appeals. Austin’s counsel stated that Austin continues to\nsuffer from serious mental illness and that nothing in Austin’s letter\n“cause[d] . . . counsel to [abandon] the legal and factual propositions” advanced\nin the habeas petition and the COA. 150 Austin’s counsel subsequently filed a\nmotion for expedited consideration of the COA. 151 We noted that this motion\nconflicted with Austin’s request to withdraw and we remanded to the district\ncourt “for the limited purpose of making findings as to whether Austin [was]\npresently competent to waive further appeals of his conviction and death\nsentence, and if Austin [was] found to be competent, whether such waiver is\nknowing and voluntary.” 152 We subsequently received a letter from Austin,\n\n\n\n\n      149 Docket Entry # 47 (letter from Austin to the Fifth Circuit received Sept. 17, 2014).\n      150 Docket Entry # 53 (filed Oct. 9, 2014).\n      151 Docket Entry # 62 (filed Nov. 14, 2014).\n      152 Austin v.

I wish to be executed. Either that, or give me Life Without\n      Parole. One or the other. . . . I do not want out of prison. I am\n      probably one of the very few guys in prison who readily admit that\n      I belong in prison. . . . When I was first bench warranted back to\n      the county jail in 2001 I was asked what was it I wanted. I asked\n      if I could be guaranteed a Life sentence without ever being brought\n      up for parole. When I was told that couldn’t be guaranteed, I chose\n      death. If you looked at the trial transcript and everything else you\n      can see that at no point did I contest the state. I only picked up\n      my appeals because in a moment of weakness I allowed a woman\n      to convince me to pick them up. That woman is no longer a factor\n      in my life. 162\n\n      In November, 2015, Austin sent another letter to this court requesting\ndenial of his appeal. 163 He restated that he had taken psychology classes, was\n“good [at] manipulation,” and had                deceived     mental     health experts\npreviously. 164 This court subsequently granted in part and denied in part\nAustin’s COA. 165      In November 2016, Austin again wrote to the court\nrequesting a denial of his appeal. 166           In reference to the claims raised\nconcerning his mental health issues, Austin stated he “[could] guarantee this\ncourt that I am now, and always have been fully competent.” 167 He again\nsuggested he had previously deceived mental health experts and manipulated\n\n\n\n\n      161 Id.\n      162 Id.\n      163 Docket Entry # 97 (letter from Austin to the Fifth Circuit filed Nov. 20, 2015).\n      164 Id.\n      165 Austin v.

To the extent Austin’s claims present\nquestions of law and mixed questions of law and fact, such that § 2254(e) does\nnot apply, we review de novo. 198 Because competency is a question of fact, we\nafford the state trial court the deference due under § 2254(e)(1). 199 Under\n§ 2254(e)(1), the state trial court’s determination that Austin was competent\nto stand trial, waive counsel, and plead guilty is presumed correct. Austin\nbears the burden of rebutting that presumption of correctness by clear and\nconvincing evidence. 200 Out of an abundance of caution, however, we will also\nconsider, in the alternative, whether Austin is entitled to habeas relief if\nAustin’s competency claims are subject to review as a mixed question of law\nand fact.\n       The trial court conducted a pretrial hearing following an expert’s\nevaluation of Austin’s competence to consider Austin’s motion to proceed pro\nse. Although the primary purpose of the hearing was to determine Austin’s\nability to represent himself, 201 the trial court addressed the question of\nAustin’s competency to stand trial and waive counsel in making that\ndetermination. 202 The transcript of the hearing also reflects that the state trial\n\n\n\n       197  28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n       198  See Henderson v.

He\ncontends that the evidence presented in his habeas petition—including records\nof two suicide attempts over twenty years before his capital murder trial as\nwell as expert reports highlighting his suicidality and depression—\ndemonstrates he was not competent before, during, or after trial. A history of\nsuicidality    and     depression,     however,      does    not    render     a   defendant\n\n\n       203  See 2RR3-6 (referencing and relying upon Dr. Brown’s report, prepared to\ndetermine if Austin was competent to stand trial, asking Austin’s counsel whether he\nconsidered Austin to be competent, and asking Austin a series of questions about his mental\nhealth history); see also 12RR3 (the state trial court noting at a later Faretta hearing that it\nhad previously conducted a hearing and found Austin “was competent to represent himself\nand was making that decision freely and voluntarily with full knowledge of the potential\nconsequences”).\n       204 2RR5-14.\n       205 2RR4 (“[T]he Court appreciates the fact that the evaluation has been done.

As\nAustin’s own expert explained, “Austin certainly understood the factual issues\nof his trial” and “[h]e knew what he was being charged with.” 208 The evidence\nAustin presents is insufficient to overcome the indicators of competence noted\nand relied upon by the state trial court.\n       Austin argues that his decision to waive counsel and plead guilty to\ncapital murder demonstrates incompetency.                  The fact that a particular\ndefendant “caus[es] his trial to be conducted in a manner most likely to result\nin a conviction and the imposition of the death penalty,” however, is not\nsufficient for a finding of incompetency. 209 This circuit has recognized that a\ndefendant’s deliberate use of the system to obtain the death penalty is evidence\nof rationality, not incompetence. 210 Again, we presume the state trial court’s\n\n\n\n       207  See Mata v.

Dretke, 381 F.3d 491, 494, 498 (5th Cir. 2004) (concluding that the\n\ndefendant’s instruction to trial counsel to “steer the trial towards imposition of the death\npenalty” was not irrational nor evidence of incompetency, but instead suggested that the\ndefendant was “quite capable of conversing with his trial counsel regarding trial strategy,\nand was not only able to participate in his defense but was also able to direct it”).\n\n                                             32\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 33     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\ndetermination regarding Austin’s competency is correct; Austin has not\novercome that presumption by clear and convincing evidence. 211\n       Even if, in the alternative, we were to consider this claim a mixed\nquestion of law and fact, such that § 2254(e)(1)’s presumption of correctness\ndoes not apply to the competency determination and our review is instead de\nnovo, Austin has failed to demonstrate that he is entitled to habeas relief.

Robinson, a trial court must hold a competency hearing when\nthere is evidence before the court that objectively creates a bona fide question\nas to whether the defendant is competent to stand trial.” 213 “In determining\nwhether there is a ‘bona fide doubt’ as to the defendant’s competence, [a] court\nconsiders: (1) any history of irrational behavior, (2) the defendant’s demeanor\nat trial, and (3) any prior medical opinion on competency.” 214 “If the trial court\nreceived evidence, viewed objectively, that should have raised a reasonable\ndoubt as to competency, yet failed to make further inquiry, the defendant has\n\n\n\n       211 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n       212 383 U.S. 375, 385 (1966) (holding that a trial court must hold a competency hearing\nwhen there is evidence before the court that objectively creates a bona fide question as to\nwhether the defendant is competent to stand trial); see also Roberts v.

He also\ncontends that regardless of whether the state trial court’s initial pretrial\nfinding of competency was proper, the information about his mental health\nhistory presented at trial should have alerted the state trial court then to the\npossibility that Austin was not competent—in other words, the information\ncreated a bona fide doubt as to Austin’s competency such that an additional\nhearing was necessary.\n      Because we conclude that Austin has failed to demonstrate by clear and\nconvincing evidence that he was not competent to stand trial, waive counsel,\nor plead guilty, we similarly reject his procedural claim that the state trial\ncourt was required to hold a pretrial competency hearing and that because it\ndid not, he was denied a fair trial. In concluding that Austin could waive\ncounsel and proceed pro se, the state trial court made an implicit finding that\nno bona fide doubt as to competency existed and that a standalone competency\nhearing was therefore not required. 216 We presume that this factual finding is\ncorrect under § 2254(e)(1) and, as noted above, Austin has failed to overcome\nthat presumption by clear and convincing evidence. If we were to consider, in\nthe alternative, the competency determination as a mixed question of law and\nfact subject to de novo review, rather than a purely factual finding, Austin has\nstill failed to demonstrate he was not competent. We therefore conclude that\nthis procedural claim is without merit.\n      Nor is Austin entitled to relief based on his claim that the state trial\ncourt failed to inquire about Austin’s competency adequately after hearing\n\n\n\n      215   Id.

However, during\ntrial, contrary evidence was adduced.                   Though this evidence clearly\ncontradicted what Austin had previously told the state court, the trial court\nknew, prior to the pretrial hearing, that Austin had “a very bad problem with\ndepression” and that Austin contemplated suicide often when depressed. 218\nNone of the evidence presented during Austin’s capital murder trial\nundermines confidence in the state trial court’s well-supported pretrial finding\nof competence, a finding based on Austin’s demeanor, Dr. Brown’s evaluation,\nthe opinion of Austin’s counsel, and the court’s interactions with Austin,\nincluding correspondence from Austin indicating an ability to reason logically\nand strategically.

Austin contends that his mental illness and the conditions of his\nconfinement rendered both his guilty plea and his waiver of trial counsel\ninvalid because they were not knowing and voluntary. 240              In light of our\nconclusion that the trial court’s finding of competency was well-supported and\ncorrect even if reviewed de novo as a mixed question of law and fact, the\nevidence of depression or other mental illness does not render an otherwise\n\n\n\n\n       234  See id.\n       235  9RR4.\n        236 9RR4-5 (“Has anyone reached any agreement with you to get you to enter your\n\nplea?”; “Has anybody promised you anything to get you to enter your plea?”; “Has anybody\nthreatened you to get you to enter your plea?”).\n        237 9RR5.\n        238 Id.\n        239 9RR6.\n        240 Austin Br. at 102.\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 39     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\neffective waiver involuntary. 241 Similarly, Austin has failed to demonstrate\nthat the conditions of his confinement rendered his decisions involuntary or\nundermined his otherwise effective waiver. Further, Austin’s letter to the trial\ncourt approximately a month before the start of trial reflected he was no longer\ndissatisfied with the conditions of his confinement and no longer suffering from\nany depression. 242 Even with the complained-of conditions removed, Austin\nindicated, consistent with his prior statements to the court, that he would not\ncontest the charges against him. 243\n       As previously noted, Austin has not presented clear and convincing\nevidence sufficient to overcome the state trial court’s determination that he\nwas competent to waive counsel and plead guilty. 244 Our independent review\nconfirms that Austin’s plea and waiver of counsel were not the product of state\ncoercion or otherwise rendered involuntary.\n                                              V\n       Austin contends that his appointed trial counsel for the seven-month\nperiod before he was allowed to proceed pro se was ineffective for failing to\nundertake significant discovery or investigation into Austin’s competency, and\nfor failing to ask Austin more questions at the Faretta hearing (Issue 13).

We review the district court’s\nconclusions of law and its conclusions of mixed law and fact de novo. 245\n      Under the familiar test of Strickland v. Washington, a successful\nineffective assistance of trial counsel claim requires a petitioner to show that\n(1) “counsel’s   performance       was    deficient”     and      (2) that   “the   deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense.” 246 Trial counsel “has a duty to make\nreasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes\nparticular investigations unnecessary.” 247 In the context of mental health\ninvestigation, “[t]rial counsel provides deficient performance if he fails to\ninvestigate a defendant’s medical history when he has reason to believe that\nthe defendant suffers from mental health problems.” 248\n      Trial counsel in this case testified that he never doubted his client’s\ncompetence, 249 and, though Austin points to the lack of investigation\nperformed, he does not allege any facts that would have alerted counsel to the\nneed to investigate Austin’s competency. As we have stated before, suicidality\nand depression are not necessarily indications of incompetence.

The fact that Austin\nsought the death penalty is not, in and of itself, sufficient to call into serious\ndoubt his competence to proceed to trial in light of the other evidence before\nthe court. His letters and colloquy with the judge do not suggest an inability\nto understand the proceedings or charges against him. To the contrary, Austin\nremained articulate and focused in his aim of representing himself and\nrefusing to present a defense. 253 The court-ordered independent evaluation\nfurther supports the state trial court’s conclusion that Austin was, in fact,\ncompetent to represent himself at trial. 254 Finally, though Austin details\nvarious psychiatric treatments, interactions with mental health professionals,\nand the opinions of experts hired post-conviction, nothing suggests he suffered\nany impairment that would bear on his competency to stand trial. 255 Even if\n\n\n\n\n       250Bell v.

Gibbs’s voir dire contained\nthe following exchanges:\n            THE COURT: And if the evidence called for it, [could you]\n     answer [the special issues] in such a way that you know a life\n     sentence would result?\n            GIBBS: Yes.\n            THE COURT: I take it, then – and correct me if I’m wrong –\n     that you would be guided by the evidence, listen to all of the\n     evidence and answer the questions according to the evidence,\n     wherever that might take you?\n            GIBBS: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . Tell us first in your own words, what\n     are your feelings on the death penalty?\n            GIBBS: I am for it and - - I’m for it. I think it’s necessary\n     for a crime deterrent, and that’s about it.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . Okay. Can you consider, then, in your\n     mind that [the first special issue], depending on the evidence, could\n     be answered either yes or no?\n            GIBBS: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: Can you consider that in Issue No. 2 that\n     it could be answered in a yes or no fashion?\n            GIBBS: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . Do you feel that you can participate in\n     that - - the deliberations, deliberating with the jury and assess the\n     death penalty if the law and the evidence supports it?\n            GIBBS: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . are you saying that if you know that\n     the defendant is representing himself and you know that he has a\n     death wish, if the law and the evidence supports assessing the\n     death penalty, are you saying you still could not assess the death\n     penalty?\n                                      45\n\f   Case: 13-70024         Document: 00514256173      Page: 46   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-70024\n             THE COURT: In other words, if the evidence called for\n      answering those questions in such a way that you answered the\n      first one yes and the second one no, you know the death penalty\n      would result?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             THE COURT: Would the fact that you feel that you would be\n      giving a defendant something that he wanted cause you in any way\n      to change your answers based on the evidence?\n             GIBBS: No.\n             THE COURT: So, then, would you - - would you, I guess,\n      honor your oath as a juror and base your verdict to those questions\n      on the evidence; and if that’s what the evidence proved to you, you\n      would answer them in that way?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             THE COURT: Even if you feel like it’s kind of unfair to give\n      him what he would want?\n             GIBBS: Exactly. That’s just the way that I feel. That’s not\n      the way that - - if that’s what the law states, then that’s how, I\n      guess, I would have to vote. But I mean - -\n             THE COURT: Your personal opinion - -\n             GIBBS: Personal feelings, I would have to say no; but I\n      would say I would vote the death penalty if that’s what the law\n      stated and - -\n             THE COURT: And the evidence showed?\n             GIBBS: Yes. 270\n\n\nIn his post-trial statement, Juror Gibbs made the following assertions:\n            I believe that ‘an eye for an eye’ is correct. If you kill\n      someone you should face the death penalty.\n            Once someone is guilty of capital murder I believe that the\n      only appropriate penalty is the death penalty. I do not think that\n      there is anything that would be mitigating so that a person should\n      not get the death penalty, this includes the person being insane.\n            Once I heard that Perry Austin had admitted to\n      intentionally killing a nine year old boy I was only going to vote\n      one way—I was going to vote ‘yes’ he was a future danger and ‘no’\n\n      270   5RR32-33, 38-40, 43-44.\n\n                                          46\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173       Page: 47    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\n      there was nothing mitigating. I was not going to vote for anything\n      other than the death penalty. 271\n\n\n      The voir dire and post-trial statements of the other four jurors are set\nforth in section VI(C) below. As noted, Austin relies only on the post-trial\nstatements to support his contention that each of these jurors was dishonest\nin answering questions posed during voir dire. We conclude that the district\ncourt was foreclosed from considering any of the jurors’ post-trial statements\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b)(1) and the Supreme Court’s decisions\napplying that Rule. Therefore, the district court did not err in failing to grant\nhabeas relief on Austin’s juror bias claim.\n      Rule 606(b)(1) provides:\n            (b) During an Inquiry Into the Validity of a Verdict or\n      Indictment.\n             (1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence. During an\n      inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n      testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during\n      the jury's deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror's or\n      another juror's vote; or any juror's mental processes concerning the\n      verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror's affidavit\n      or evidence of a juror's statement on these matters. 272\n      The text of the rule is clear, and it explicitly directs that “a juror may not\ntestify about . . . the effect of anything on that juror’s . . . vote . . . or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The Rule further\nprovides, “[t]he court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s\nstatement on these matters.” Each of the post-trial statements by jurors comes\nwithin these prohibitions.\n\n\n      271   Pet.

Shauers that “Rule 606(b)\napplies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure\na new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” 273 The Court\nrejected the argument that the inquiry under McDonough “begins and ends\nwith what happened during voir dire,” and therefore that Rule 606(b) should\nbe inapplicable. 274 The Court reasoned that “[w]hether or not a juror’s alleged\nmisconduct during voir dire had a direct effect on the jury’s verdict, the motion\nfor a new trial requires a court to determine whether the verdict can stand.” 275\nThe Court further explained:\n       [A] party’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite\n       Rule 606(b)’s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are\n       unbiased. Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that conceals bias,\n       juror impartiality is adequately assured by the parties’ ability to\n       bring to the court’s attention any evidence of bias before the verdict\n       is rendered, and to employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict\n       is rendered. 276\n\n       The Ninth Circuit has similarly applied Rule 606(b) in a direct criminal\nappeal in which a juror’s post-trial affidavit averred that other jurors had\ndiscussed the evidence against the defendant “and made up their minds about\nhis guilt before the start of deliberations.” 277 In denying relief, the court\nexplained that “[t]he notion that egregious juror conduct will not necessarily\nresult in relief from the verdict may seem antithetical to our system of due\n\n\n\n       273 Warger v.

United States, 483 U.S. 107, 127 (1987) (explaining\n\nthat “[t]he suitability of an individual for the responsibility of jury service, of course, is\nexamined during voir dire,” and “after the trial a party may seek to impeach the verdict by\nnonjuror evidence of misconduct”).\n       277 United States v. Leung, 796 F.3d 1032, 1034 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 49      Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-70024\nprocess.” 278 But the Ninth Circuit discerned that “[t]he Rule . . . exists for good\nreason—it protects jurors from harassment and maintains the integrity and\nfinality of jury verdicts.” 279 The court observed, “[w]hile persistent inquiry into\ninternal jury processes could ‘in some instances lead to the invalidation of\nverdicts reached after irresponsible or improper juror behavior,’ our very\nsystem of trial by jury might not ‘survive such efforts to perfect it.’” 280\n       The only exception that the Supreme Court has made to Rule 606(b)(1)’s\nprohibitions is “when, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with\ncompelling evidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements\nindicating that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her\nvote to convict.” 281 The Court reasoned in Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado that\n“[a]ll forms of improper bias pose challenges to the trial process. But there is\na sound basis to treat racial bias with added precaution.” 282                     The Court\nconcluded that “[a] constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system\nmust be addressed—including, in some instances, after the verdict has been\nentered—is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts,\na confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right.” 283\nThere is no suggestion or indication of racial animus or bias in the present\n\n\n\n\n       278  Id. at 1036.\n       279  Id.\n        280 Id.

Rule 606(b) does\n      not bar admission of post-trial statements to prove that the jurors\n      failed to answer a material question honestly during voir dire. 284\n\n      That analysis was clearly incorrect in light of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision and reasoning in Warger v. Shauers, and, after full briefing and\nplenary consideration, we now disavow our prior reasoning and our discussion\nof Rule 606(b) in granting a COA on Austin’s jury bias claim. Though we cited\nWarger in a footnote, our analysis of that decision was not in-depth and was\ninaccurate. 285\n      This court’s decision in Hatten v. Quarterman, 286 which we also cited in\na footnote in our opinion and order granting a COA on Austin’s jury bias\nclaim, 287 involved unusual circumstances and does not support Austin’s\ncontention that the post-trial statements at issue are admissible to impeach\nthe jury’s verdict and require a new trial. In Hatten, questions as to whether\na juror had been truthful during voir dire and was biased were raised in the\nmidst of trial, before the case was submitted to the jury. 288 The juror in\n\n\n\n      284 Austin v.

Only an implication can be drawn from Hatten\nthat if a post-trial affidavit demonstrated a juror’s bias, the affidavit could be\nused to impeach the verdict and a new trial would be necessary. An implication\nis not a holding. In any event, to the extent that it could be argued that Hatten\ncontained such a holding, Hatten is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s\n\n\n\n\n       289  Id.; see also id. at 600 (reflecting that the claims in the subsequent federal habeas\nproceeding were that “Hatten [the defendant] complains that Hollins's [the juror’s] bias is\nreflected by the facts that: (a) Hollins lied on his juror questionnaire and during his\nquestioning regarding his drug use; (b) Hollins concealed the scope of his relationship with\nIsaac Robinson, the victim's father, and with Hatten's [the defendant’s] stepfather; and (c)\nHollins [the juror] was threatened with prosecution during trial and consequently must have\nfavored the prosecution”).\n        290 Id. at 602.\n        291 Id.\n        292 See id.\n\n\n\n                                              51\n\f    Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173         Page: 52     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-70024\nsubsequent decision in Warger and the Supreme Court’s explication of Warger\nand Tanner in Pena-Rodriguez. 293\n       The post-trial statements of the five jurors are inadmissible by virtue of\nRule 606(b). Austin has no other evidence that any of these jurors were less\nthan candid during voir dire. Austin’s jury bias claim therefore fails.\n                                             C\n       As an alternative basis for affirming the district court’s judgment with\nrespect to Austin’s juror bias claim, we conclude that even were the jurors’ post-\ntrial statements admissible, Austin has not demonstrated that a juror “failed\nto answer honestly a material question on voir dire,” and “that a correct\nresponse would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 294\n       Two special issues were to be submitted to the jury, and potential jurors\nwere questioned about these issues during voir dire. The first special issue\nwas “[d]o you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a\nprobability that the defendant, Perry Allen Austin, would commit criminal acts\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.” 295 The second\nspecial issue was “[d]o you find from the evidence, taking into consideration all\nof the evidence, including the circumstances of the offense, the defendant's\ncharacter and background, and the personal moral culpability of the\ndefendant, Perry Allen Austin, that there is a sufficient mitigating\n\n\n\n       293  See Pena-Rodriguez v.

The only thing that\n      would make that different is if the person was insane.\n             After Perry Austin admitted he did the murder the case was\n      pretty simple. He wanted the death penalty and we were happy to\n      give it to him. 299\n\n      The first paragraph of the post-trial statement reflects Erwin’s beliefs as\nof the date of the statement. It does not say that Erwin held these beliefs at\nthe time of voir dire. Two years after a trial, a juror’s beliefs may have changed,\nparticularly after participating in a capital trial and voting to impose a death\nsentence.       But even if Erwin thought during voir dire that the only\ncircumstance warranting a life sentence as opposed to a death sentence would\nbe insanity when the crime was committed, his responses to the questions he\nwas asked during voir dire are consistent with that view. He was not asked to\nidentify what factors would cause him to vote in favor of a life sentence. He\nwas only asked if there were circumstances in which he could vote for a life\nsentence, and his post-trial statement confirms that there was at least one such\ncircumstance.\n\n\n\n\n      298   4RR18-31.\n      299   Pet.

Nothing\nin the second paragraph is an assertion that the evidence called for a life\nsentence but that Erwin ignored that evidence. Erwin was not required to vote\nfor a life sentence simply because there was mitigating evidence.        Austin\nadmitted to murdering a child, and during his pro se closing statement, Austin\nhimself set forth facts that he said supported answering the two special issues\nin a way that would result in a death sentence. Erwin’s brief characterization\nin his post-trial statement of why the jury voted as it did does not contradict\nanything that Erwin said during voir dire. In fact, Erwin candidly revealed\nduring voir dire that he thought that someone who killed an elderly person or\na child should receive the death penalty. We do not consider whether there\nmay have been cause to strike Erwin based on his voir dire testimony or his\npost-trial statement because Austin has not met the first prong of McDonough,\nthat Erwin was dishonest during voir dire. There is no evidence of dishonesty.\n      Juror Condon\n      Juror Condon’s voir dire contained the following relevant exchanges:\n            THE COURT: And if the evidence called for it, [could you]\n      answer [the special issues] in such a way that you know a life\n      sentence would result?\n            CONDON: Yes.\n            THE COURT: All right. I take it, Mr. Condon, your feelings\n      are that you would listen to everything, be guided by the evidence\n      and the law, wherever that might take you?\n            CONDON: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . Can you tell us in your own words\n      what your feelings are on the death penalty?\n            CONDON: Well, I feel that in certain cases it’s justifiable\n      punishment for - - never been asked to put it in words, I guess.

Could you participate in the jury\n     deliberations and assessing the death penalty if the evidence and\n     the law directs you to?\n            CONDON: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: Okay. Do you understand - - can you\n     perceive that [the second special] issue could be answered either\n     yes or no as well?\n            CONDON: Yes.\n            ...\n            PROSECUTION: . . . Let’s say you were king of the world. If\n     you were the king, would your kingdom have a death penalty?\n            CONDON: Yes.\n            PROSECUTION: And why?\n            CONDON: I just feel that certain crimes deserve the\n     ultimate punishment, I guess. 300\n\n\nIn his post-conviction statement, Condon made the following assertions:\n           For me, if somebody is not insane and kills somebody,\n     especially a child, the only appropriate penalty is the death\n     penalty. Other than showing that it was an accident or the person\n     was insane I do not think that any other considerations are\n     relevant. If you are found guilty of capital murder you should get\n     the death penalty.\n     ...\n           When I was asked at the time the jury was selected whether\n     I could consider voting for life I said yes and I was thinking about\n     a situation where someone was insane and did not know what they\n     were doing. 301\n\n\n\n\n     300   5RR5-17.\n     301   Pet.

It does not say that Condon held these view\nduring voir dire. But even if he held those views during voir dire, nothing in\nthe first paragraph or the second paragraph contradicts Condon’s voir dire\ntestimony. When asked to “tell us in your own words what your feelings are\non the death penalty,” Condon responded, “[i]f someone commits a\npremeditated act of violence against someone else, I think it’s justifiable they\nbe repaid in kind.” That is a categorical statement. It is entirely consistent\nwith both the first and second paragraphs of Condon’s post-trial statement, as\nis Condon’s statement during voir dire that “I just feel that certain crimes\ndeserve the ultimate punishment.” Condon was not asked during voir dire\nwhether the only circumstance that would cause him to vote for a life sentence\nwould be the insanity of the defendant. Austin has not established the first\nrequirement of McDonough, which is that Condon failed to answer honestly a\nmaterial question.\n      Juror Gibbs\n      Gibbs’s voir dire contained the following exchanges:\n             THE COURT: And if the evidence called for it, [could you]\n      answer [the special issues] in such a way that you know a life\n      sentence would result?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             THE COURT: I take it, then – and correct me if I’m wrong –\n      that you would be guided by the evidence, listen to all of the\n      evidence and answer the questions according to the evidence,\n      wherever that might take you?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             ...\n             PROSECUTION: . . . Tell us first in your own words, what\n      are your feelings on the death penalty?\n             GIBBS: I am for it and - - I’m for it. I think it’s necessary\n      for a crime deterrent, and that’s about it.\n\n                                      57\n\fCase: 13-70024    Document: 00514256173     Page: 58   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                             No. 13-70024\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . Okay.

Do you feel that you can participate in\n  that - - the deliberations, deliberating with the jury and assess the\n  death penalty if the law and the evidence supports it?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . are you saying that if you know that\n  the defendant is representing himself and you know that he has a\n  death wish, if the law and the evidence supports assessing the\n  death penalty, are you saying you still could not assess the death\n  penalty?\n         THE COURT: In other words, if the evidence called for\n  answering those questions in such a way that you answered the\n  first one yes and the second one no, you know the death penalty\n  would result?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         THE COURT: Would the fact that you feel that you would be\n  giving a defendant something that he wanted cause you in any way\n  to change your answers based on the evidence?\n         GIBBS: No.\n         THE COURT: So, then, would you - - would you, I guess,\n  honor your oath as a juror and base your verdict to those questions\n  on the evidence; and if that’s what the evidence proved to you, you\n  would answer them in that way?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         THE COURT: Even if you feel like it’s kind of unfair to give\n  him what he would want?\n         GIBBS: Exactly. That’s just the way that I feel. That’s not\n  the way that - - if that’s what the law states, then that’s how, I\n  guess, I would have to vote. But I mean - -\n         THE COURT: Your personal opinion - -\n                                   58\n\f   Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173       Page: 59   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\n            GIBBS: Personal feelings, I would have to say no; but I\n      would say I would vote the death penalty if that’s what the law\n      stated and - -\n            THE COURT: And the evidence showed?\n            GIBBS: Yes. 302\n\nIn his post-trial statement, Juror Gibbs made the following assertions:\n            I believe that ‘an eye for an eye’ is correct. If you kill\n      someone you should face the death penalty.\n            Once someone is guilty of capital murder I believe that the\n      only appropriate penalty is the death penalty. I do not think that\n      there is anything that would be mitigating so that a person should\n      not get the death penalty, this includes the person being insane.\n            Once I heard that Perry Austin had admitted to\n      intentionally killing a nine year old boy I was only going to vote\n      one way—I was going to vote ‘yes’ he was a future danger and ‘no’\n      there was nothing mitigating. I was not going to vote for anything\n      other than the death penalty. 303\n\n\n      The first two paragraphs reflect Gibbs’ belief as of the date of his\nstatement. They are not evidence that he held these views during voir dire.\nThe third paragraph reflects Gibbs’ weighing of all the evidence. As discussed\nabove, there is no evidence that before or during voir dire, Gibbs had “heard\nthat Perry Austin had admitted to intentionally killing a nine year old boy.”\nThe record reflects that D.K.’s age was not in evidence until after voir dire. 304\nWhen the facts were presented during trial, Austin gave the fact that Austin\nintentionally killed a nine-year-old child controlling weight. He did not say he\nwould do otherwise in his voir dire testimony.\n      Juror Tamayo\n\n\n\n      302 5RR32-33, 38-40, 43-44.\n      303 Pet.

I’m for it.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . You may hear something that’s\n  sufficient enough for you that you think even though he’s a capital\n  murderer and he’s probably going to be dangerous, he ought to\n  receive life instead of death.

Does that question make sense\n  to you?\n         TAMAYO: It does.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: If you were the king and it’s your kingdom\n  and you get to write the laws, would your kingdom have a death\n  penalty?\n         TAMAYO: Well, yeah.

Hypothetically, let’s assume during\n  the course of the trial, if you’re selected to sit on the jury, you find\n  out not only that he’s representing himself but that he has a death\n  wish. He’s not asking any questions. He just sits there, and he\n  wants y’all to give him the death penalty. How does that make you\n  feel?\n\n                                    60\n\f    Case: 13-70024      Document: 00514256173         Page: 61    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\n            TAMAYO: Well, it’s not whether he wants it or not. It’s just\n       whether it’s given to him or not.\n            PROSECUTION: Based on the law and evidence?\n            TAMAYO: Right. 305\nJuror Tamayo’s post-trial statement contained the following:\n             The death penalty is especially appropriate for child killers.\n       I do not consider mental illness to be mitigation because it is too\n       easy for defendants to lie and manipulate circumstances. 306\n\n\n       Tamayo’s post-trial statement does not say that he held these views\nduring voir dire. The statement reflects his beliefs two years after trial. In\nany event, the statement expresses the weight that Tamayo would give to two\nfactors. His belief that the death penalty is especially appropriate for child\nkillers and that he does not consider mental illness to be mitigating is simply\nhow he weighs such evidence. He does not consider mental illness to be “a\nsufficient mitigating circumstance,” and the special issue asked only if there is\n“a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances.” If Austin’s position\nwere correct, a prospective juror would be required to confirm during voir dire\nthat he or she would vote for a life sentence if there were evidence of mental\nillness, at least in some circumstances. Neither the law nor the issues put to\nAustin’s jury requires this. The Supreme Court has long recognized that\nevidence of mental illness is a two-edged sword when a jury is deciding whether\na death sentence is appropriate. 307\n       Juror Finnegan\n       Juror Finnegan’s voir dire proceeded, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\n       305 5RR46-60.\n       306 Pet.

So then I take it, Mr. Finnegan,\n  what you’re telling us is that you would listen to all of the evidence,\n  follow the law and answer those questions according to the law and\n  the evidence, wherever that might lead you?\n          FINNEGAN: Absolutely.\n          ...\n          PROSECUTION: Okay.

Anything about your experience in\n  law enforcement dealing with defense attorneys or prosecutors\n  that would affect your ability to be a juror in a criminal case?\n          FINNEGAN: No. Purely professional.\n          PROSECUTION: Okay.

Now, why don’t you tell\n  me, Mr. Finnegan, if you will, what your feelings are about the\n  death penalty and what purpose do you think it serves in our\n  society?\n          FINNEGAN: Feelings?\n          PROSECUTION: Yes, sir.\n          FINNEGAN: First, it’s a necessary evil - -\n          PROSECUTION: Okay.\n          FINNEGAN: - - I would say.

[W]hen you say “heinous crimes,” what\n  types of offenses came to your mind where you thought the death\n  penalty might be appropriate?\n          FINNEGAN: Violent crimes against a child.\n          PROSECUTION: Okay.\n\n\n\n                                    62\n\f    Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173        Page: 63     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 13-70024\n              FINNEGAN: That would be, you know - - and purely\n       innocent type of victim without any defense, something along those\n       lines. That’s what first issue came to my mind.\n              ...\n              PROSECUTION: Can you see how special issue No. 2 can be\n       answered yes or no just depending on what you hear in the\n       courtroom?\n              FINNEGAN: I do. 308\n\nIn his post-trial statement, Juror Finnegan made the following assertions:\n             I believe that once Austin was found guilty of the murder of\n       the victim the only appropriate sentence was death in accordance\n       with Texas law. I believe that the prosecutors chose me to be on\n       Austin’s jury because Perry wanted to die and Perry knew that\n       with me working in law enforcement I would sentence him to\n       death. Perry allowed me to stay on his jury. 309\n\n       Nothing in Finnegan’s post-trial statement indicates that he was\ndishonest in responding to questions during voir dire. Finnegan’s statement\nrefers to “the victim,” not murder victims generically. Finnegan did not say\nthat he would automatically vote for the death penalty in every case. 310 The\nvictim in this case was a nine-year-old boy. For the reasons discussed above,\nFinnegan’s post-trial statement is evidence of the weight that he gave to the\nnature of the crime, not evidence that Finnegan failed to respond truthfully to\ninquiries during voir dire.\n       None of the post-trial statements establish that a juror answered a\nquestion dishonestly during voir dire.\n\n\n\n\n       308 5RR66-83.\n       309 Pet.

We need not resolve\nthe issue with regard to Austin’s incompetency claims. “A district court may\nrefuse an evidentiary hearing where there is not ‘a factual dispute which, if\nresolved in [the prisoner’s] favor, would entitle him to relief.’” 314 We note that\nthe district court granted Austin time and funding to investigate his claims, 315\nand concluded that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary to resolve the\nclaims presented in his petition. 316 Austin still fails to adduce evidence that\ncreates a factual dispute that, if resolved in his favor, would entitle him to\nrelief on his competency claim.

The\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing on\nthe issue of competence.\n       With respect to the jury bias claim, it appears that Austin pursued an\nevidentiary hearing in the federal district court only on the issue of\ncompetence. 317 Austin now concedes that further factual development with\nregard to his juror bias claim is not necessary. 318                   However, out of an\nabundance of caution, and to the extent he sought an evidentiary hearing in\nrelation to his juror bias claims in his briefing in our court, 319 we address\nwhether the district court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing\nregarding juror bias.

The record amply supports, and in fact compels, the conclusion\nthat Austin had resolved to accept all jurors that the State accepted and that\nif, during voir dire, the five jurors had expressed the views contained in their\npost-trial statements, Austin would not have challenged any of those jurors for\ncause, because Austin’s trial strategy was to obtain the death penalty. Austin\ncannot now claim in a habeas proceeding that had he known the jurors’ actual\nviews, or had he known that they had predilections and a bias in favor of the\ndeath penalty, he would have challenged them for cause and thereby preserved\nthe issue for appeal or collateral review. The record is clear that he would not\nhave challenged any of the five jurors for cause during the trial even had there\nbeen a basis for doing so.\n      It is undisputed that when voir dire occurred, Austin intended to plead\nguilty, and after the jurors were seated, Austin entered a guilty plea in their\npresence.   The jury was empaneled only to decide whether Austin would\nreceive a life sentence or a death sentence. During closing arguments, Austin\npersonally argued to the jury that, because of the nature of his crime and\nbecause of his past and future dangerousness, it should answer the two\nquestions submitted in a way that would require imposition of the death\npenalty. The Supreme Court has never held that, consistent with a defendant’s\ntrial strategy, a defendant may knowingly accept a biased juror and then, after\na change of heart in collateral proceedings, obtain automatic reversal because\nof that juror’s bias.\n                                       67\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 68      Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-70024\n       To the contrary, the Supreme Court explained in McDonough Power\nEquipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, the primary case on which Austin relies, that\n“[i]t is not clear from the opinion of the Court of Appeals whether the\ninformation stated in Greenwood’s affidavit was known to respondents or their\ncounsel at the time of the voir dire examination.” 8 Importantly, the Court\nadmonished that “[i]f it were, of course, [defendants] would be barred from\nlater challenging the composition of the jury when they had chosen not to\ninterrogate [the potentially biased juror] further upon receiving an answer\nwhich they thought to be factually incorrect.” 9 The Supreme Court cited a\ndecision from the Eighth Circuit in support of this conclusion, 10 which held\nthat “‘[t]he right to challenge the panel or to challenge a particular juror may\nbe waived, and in fact is waived by failure to seasonably object.’” 11 The Eighth\nCircuit explained that\n       It is established that failure to object at the time the jury is\n       empaneled operates as a conclusive waiver if the basis of the\n       objection is known of [sic] might have been known or discovered\n       through the exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the party is\n       otherwise chargeable with knowledge of the ground of the\n       objection. 12\n\n\n\n       8 McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v.

First, Austin may well\nhave elicited the same information that is contained in the jurors’ post-trial\nstatements had he questioned these jurors during voir dire. 14 Second, and\nmore importantly, even had the jurors expressed during voir dire what they\nsaid in their post-trial statements, Austin would have had to have asserted a\nchallenge for cause to have preserved a claim of juror bias for consideration on\nappeal or in a habeas proceeding. The record establishes that Austin would\nnot have challenged them for cause.\n       Prior to trial Austin declared that he would accept every juror that the\nState accepted and that he would not exercise any peremptory challenges. 15\nDuring voir dire at least two of the jurors that Austin now contends were biased\nmade statements that should have at least prompted inquiry, if not challenges\nfor cause, by Austin regarding bias or pre-judgment of the issues to be decided\nby the jury.\n       During the voir dire of Juror Erwin, the following exchange occurred:\n             ERWIN: There’s a few cases I think you should get the death\n       penalty, but that’s just me.\n\n\n\nbiased juror] on the panel” and that “[t]o permit this would be to allow trial counsel to waive\nthe defendant’s right to an impartial jury”).\n        13 See generally United States v.

He has not asserted in habeas\nproceedings that his counsel (himself) was ineffective for failing to question\nthese jurors during voir dire or for failing to challenge them for cause. His only\ncontention is that, if he had known during voir dire the substance of the five\njurors’ post-trial statements, he would have had grounds to challenge each of\nthem for cause. If grounds to remove them for cause did exist, and had those\ngrounds been revealed during voir dire, then it would have been incumbent\nupon Austin actually to raise challenges for cause. Otherwise, as the Eighth\nCircuit cogently explained, “‘[i]f a defendant is allowed to . . . forego challenges\nfor-cause to a biased juror and then allowed to have the conviction reversed on\nappeal because of that juror’s service, that would be equivalent to allowing the\ndefendant to plant an error and grow a risk-free trial.’” 16\n       It rings hollow for Austin now to contend that had he known the five\njurors’ views he would have challenged them for cause. Austin’s actions, and\nmore importantly inactions, in declining to ask any questions during voir dire,\ndeciding before trial to accept all jurors the State accepted, and declining to\nexercise any preemptory challenges are entirely consistent with his trial\nstrategy, which he set forth in letters to the trial court. Prior to trial, Austin\nadvised the trial court that he was “still firm about [his] decision to not fight\nthis case” and that “since [he was] not going to put up any type of defense,” he\nhad “decided that it [was] not necessary for [him] to review [his] case file.” 17\n       The Supreme Court has never held that juror bias is structural error\nrequiring automatic reversal.

The Court then\nquoted its statement in Ross: “‘Had [the biased juror] sat on the jury that\nultimately sentenced petitioner to death, and had petitioner properly\npreserved his right to challenge the trial court’s failure to remove [the juror]\nfor cause, the sentence would have to be overturned.’” 32\n       The Supreme Court’s listings of “structural errors” that require\nautomatic reversal do not include jury bias, either when it is raised in a direct\nappeal or in habeas proceedings. 33 A plurality opinion of the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n       29  Id.\n       30  Id. at 316.\n        31 Id.

In Gomez v. United States, the Supreme Court quoted the plurality\nopinion in Gray, 35 but Gomez did not involve a biased juror. The Court held in\nGomez, a direct criminal appeal, that the harmless error rule did not apply\nwhen, over the objection of the defendant, a magistrate judge exceeded his\njurisdiction when he presided over the selection of a jury in a criminal case. 36\n       Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision in Olano, 37 more than one federal\nCircuit Court of Appeals held in the context of a direct criminal appeal that a\ndefendant’s failure to raise a juror’s lack of impartiality would not be\nconsidered if the issue was not raised at trial and the factual basis of the bias\nclaim was known at the time of trial.

He is, therefore, foreclosed on appeal.” 42 The court reasoned that\n“[s]urely, the raise-or-waive rule is fully operative in respect to these rulings” 43\nand that the “plain-error doctrine [is] to be invoked ‘sparingly’ and only to avert\n‘miscarriage of justice.’” 44\n       Similarly, in United States v.

Additionally, the statement in the vacated opinion was dicta. 59 A\nclaim of actual bias may be raised even if no objection was made during voir\ndire, depending on the facts of a particular case and its procedural posture.\nThis would be the case, for example, when neither a defendant nor her counsel\nhad a reason to know of the bias and voir dire questioning would not have\nrevealed the bias. But the decided weight of the authorities in this area,\ndiscussed above, concludes that there are circumstances when the failure to\nobject or move to strike a juror for cause precludes reversal of the verdict on\nappeal or in habeas proceedings based on juror bias.\n       To be clear, I am not suggesting that Austin waived his claim of juror\nbias by failing to question the jurors during voir dire. Rather, an alternate\nground for affirming the district court’s judgment regarding the jury bias claim\nis that one of McDonough’s requirements—that besides showing “that a juror\nfailed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire” a claimant must\n“further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a\nchallenge for cause” 60—necessarily assumes that, had voir dire provided a\nvalid basis for making a for-cause challenge, the claimant would have made\nthe challenge. Because Austin made a conscious decision as a matter of trial\nstrategy to accept all jurors accepted by the State, and because the record\nsupports the conclusion that Austin would not have challenged the jurors for\ncause had they expressed during voir dire what they expressed in the post-trial\n\n\n\n\n       58 Id. at 493 n.64 (citing United States v.

It is also unclear whether 28 U.S.C. § 2111\napplies. It provides that “[o]n the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in\nany case, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record\nwithout regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of\nthe parties.” 61 It would seem that in many if not most cases when both prongs\nof McDonough are met the impact on the trial would obviously be injurious or\nthe substantial rights of a party would be affected. But the present case is a\nrelatively unusual one.       To the extent that the analysis set forth by the\nSupreme Court in Fry v. Pliler, 62 and Brecht v. Abrahamson 63 applies, any\nconstitutional error that occurred because any one of the five challenged jurors\nparticipated in the verdict did not have a substantial and injurious impact on\nthe verdict.\n      In assessing harmlessness on direct review, the Government bears the\nburden of proving that a constitutional error was “harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” 64 On collateral review, however, “concerns about finality,\ncomity, and federalism,” 65 mandate that a federal habeas petitioner bears the\n\n\n\n      61 28 U.S.C. § 2111.\n      62 551 U.S. 112 (2007).\n      63 507 U.S. 619 (1993).\n      64 Chapman v.

He pled guilty. During\nthe trial on the question of the appropriate penalty—life or death—Austin\nconsistently vocalized and pursued a strategy designed to persuade the jury to\nanswer the Texas special issues such that he received the death penalty.\nAustin did not testify. 69 He did cross-examine one witness and make a closing\nstatement; during both, he only contested the State’s suggestion to the jury\nthat he was a pedophile. 70 Austin expressed to the jury at closing that he would\nkill again and explained why the jury should answer the special issues such\nthat he received a death sentence. 71              Although some evidence of Austin’s\n\n\n       66  Brecht v.

OWEN, Circuit Judge:\n      Perry Allen Austin was convicted of capital murder in Texas state court\nand sentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the\ntrial court’s judgment and subsequently dismissed Austin’s state habeas\npetition as untimely. Austin filed a federal habeas petition. The federal\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the State and denied a certificate\nof appealability (COA). This court granted Austin a COA on fourteen of his\ntwenty-one grounds. We now affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\f    Case: 13-70024         Document: 00514256173         Page: 2     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-70024\n                                               I\n      We briefly recount the pertinent facts leading up to Austin’s trial for\ncapital murder, as outlined in a prior opinion:\n             In 1978, [Austin] raped one of his adolescent sisters at gunpoint\n      and attempted to rape another, before robbing a third, older sister and\n      his mother. . . . A jury convicted Austin of rape, attempted rape, and\n      aggravated robbery.\n             Following this conviction, Austin was released on parole in 1991\n      and began a sexual relationship with J.O., a fourteen-year-old female.\n      Through J.O., Austin met D.K., a nine-year-old male. D.K. disappeared\n      in August 1992. While investigating D.K.’s disappearance, police\n      discovered Austin’s relationship with J.O. and charges were brought\n      against Austin. He pled guilty to sexual assault of a child and received\n      a thirty-year sentence. In April 1993, D.K.’s remains were found.\n      Although there was physical evidence connecting Austin to D.K.’s\n      murder and Austin admitted that D.K. had been in his vehicle the day of\n      D.K.’s disappearance, police did not believe they had sufficient evidence\n      to prove Austin was responsible for D.K.’s murder.\n             Austin alleges that prison conditions caused his mental health to\n      deteriorate after he was incarcerated for sexually assaulting J.O. In\n      1995, he stabbed another prisoner and received an additional twenty-\n      year sentence. By this point, Austin was confined in administrative\n      segregation.\n             In September 2000, Austin wrote a letter to a Houston police\n      officer, stating that he would confess to D.K.’s murder if he would be\n      guaranteed the death penalty. [Austin stated if that was not guaranteed,\n      he would kill a prison guard as a way of guaranteeing himself the death\n      penalty.] 1 Austin was interviewed at the state prison and confessed\n      orally and in writing to slitting D.K.’s throat with a knife because Austin\n      was angry at D.K.’s brother for allegedly stealing drugs from Austin’s\n      car. Austin was indicted for capital murder on February 15, 2001. On\n      March 21, Mack Arnold was appointed to represent Austin. 2\n\n\n\n\n      1   14RR24.\n      2   Austin v. Davis, 647 F.

I am fully competent\nand definitely know the difference between right and wrong.” 11 In his last\n\n\n      3 CR at 5 (letter from Austin to the trial court file stamped May 15, 2001).\n      4 Id.\n      5 Id.\n      6 Id.\n      7 CR at 16 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated July 19, 2001); ROA.629.\n      8 CR at 16; ROA.629.\n      9 CR at 16.\n      10 CR at 18 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Aug. 8, 2001).\n      11 Id.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f     Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173          Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\nletter to the state trial court before the pretrial hearing to determine if Austin\ncould represent himself, Austin again requested to proceed pro se, noting he\nwas “fully aware of the consequences” and “aware that this is within [his]\nright.” 12 He also stated that he did not wish to participate in jury selection and\nthat he would “not contest any juror the prosecution selects.” 13\n       Prior to trial, Austin’s counsel requested that the state trial court permit\nand authorize payment for a psychological examination of Austin by Dr.\nJerome Brown, a clinical psychologist. 14 The trial court granted counsel’s\nrequest, 15 although it appears that counsel did not immediately seek Dr.\nBrown’s services. 16 The trial court held a conference in chambers six weeks\nlater and explained to Austin that it wanted a psychological evaluation\nperformed before it could decide whether Austin could proceed pro se. 17 The\ntrial court ordered Dr. Brown to evaluate Austin to determine his competency\nto stand trial. 18 In his report, prepared after meeting with Austin, Dr. Brown\nnoted that Austin “had no trouble providing relevant and coherent background\ninformation,” was able to describe the charges against him and the court\nproceedings that had occurred, and could explain why he wanted to represent\nhimself. 19 Dr. Brown concluded that Austin was “alert, well-oriented, and able\nto communicate his ideas without difficulty.” 20 Dr. Brown also noted that\n\n\n       12 CR at 20 (letter from Austin to the trial court dated Aug. 14, 2001).\n       13 Id.\n       14 CR at 12-13 (motion submitted May 30, 2001).\n       15 CR at 11 (granting motion on July 13, 2001).\n       16 2RR3 (trial court referring to a previous conference in chambers six weeks before in\n\nwhich it noted that the evaluation had not yet occurred); Austin Br. at 15 (specifying that the\nconference occurred on August 27, 2001).\n       17 2RR3-4.\n       18 CR at 24 (evaluation conducted on September 20, 2001).\n       19 CR at 24-25.\n       20 CR at 26.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f     Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173              Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\nAustin displayed no “bizarre verbalizations,” hallucinations, or delusions\ntypically indicative of severe mental illness nor did he exhibit any indication\nof   disorganization,       confusion,      or       other     significant   difficulties   in\ncommunication. 21 Although the report acknowledged Austin’s use of alcohol\nand drugs in prison, it did not otherwise mention any past mental health\nissues. 22 Dr. Brown concluded that Austin was competent to stand trial. 23\n       After the evaluation, the state trial court held a pretrial Faretta hearing\nto consider Austin’s request to proceed pro se. Under Faretta v. California, a\ncriminal defendant has a right to self-representation. 24 To exercise that right,\na defendant must competently, knowingly, and intelligently waive his right to\ncounsel. 25 At the hearing, the trial court noted that it had read Austin’s letters\nand spoken with Austin at a prior hearing. 26 The trial court also noted that it\nwas in possession of Dr. Brown’s report summarizing his evaluation of Austin’s\ncompetency to stand trial. 27 The trial court asked Austin’s counsel his opinion\n\n\n\n       21  Id.\n       22  CR at 24-26.\n        23 CR at 26.\n        24 Faretta v.

Austin explained that he wanted\ncomplete control over trial strategy, although he agreed to standby counsel\n“[f]or legal advice only.” 29 The court also asked Austin four questions about his\nmental health history. 30 Austin stated he had had no mental health issues. 31\nThe trial court issued findings, granted Austin’s request to proceed to trial pro\nse, and appointed standby counsel. 32\n      After the Faretta hearing, but before trial began, Austin submitted an\naffidavit to the state trial court, stating that he wished to have his court order\nfor access to the law library rescinded because he thought “it [was] not\nnecessary for [him] to attend additional [l]aw [l]ibrary sessions to research the\n\n\n\n\n      28 Id.\n      29 2RR13.\n      30 2RR6-7.\n      31 Id.\n\n             THE COURT: Have you ever been declared mentally incompetent?\n             AUSTIN: No, ma’am.\n             THE COURT: Have you ever been treated for any mental health disorder?\n             AUSTIN: No, ma’am.\n             ...\n             THE COURT: Okay.

It used to [not] bother me, anything I did, it never\n      bothered me but ever since this thing happened to him I’d be\n      watching TV and I’d be thinking and I would just start crying[,]\n      stuff like that. 58\n\nAustin explained that he had “been going to counseling and psychiatrists since\n[he] was a kid,” that he “had behavioral problems,” “was always in trouble at\nschool,” and “was emotionally disturbed.” 59 He stated that he “just want[ed]\nto get this over with and close it up,” and that “[t]he only reason [he hadn’t]\nkilled [himself] is because” he “actually believe[s] there is a hell.” 60            He\nexplained: “Put it this way[,] I’m not killing myself, I’m just not putting on a\ndefense. I regret something I did, I’m gonna pay for it[,] I’m not gonna make\nno excuses for nothing.” 61\n      Austin for the most part refrained from questioning witnesses and\npresenting evidence during the punishment phase. 62 He did not testify. 63 He\nbriefly cross-examined an F.B.I. agent about Austin’s relationship with J.O.,\nspecifically asking whether J.O.’s mother informed the agent that Austin used\nto date her before dating J.O. and whether J.O.’s mother told the agent that\nJ.O. looked old enough to drink in bars. 64 Austin made a closing statement,\n\n\n\n\n      58 Id.\n      59 ROA.853.\n      60 Id.\n      61 Id.\n      62 See generally Reporter’s Record vols. 9-11.\n      63 10RR78.\n      64 9RR125-26.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f   Case: 13-70024         Document: 00514256173    Page: 11   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 13-70024\ntelling the jury he was violent, mean, and sometimes thought he had no\nconscience. 65 He also stated:\n      I’ve been like this all my life, and I doubt if I’ll change. What I\n      wanted to say was they think I have a death wish. Well, that’s not\n      true. One of the reasons why I went ahead and confessed [to killing\n      D.K.] was it was bothering me, what I did. Regardless of what\n      everybody thinks, it does. I’ve never killed anybody before.\n      And, . . . I also knew that my acts of violence would not stop even\n      though I was in prison. 66\n\nHe referred to an incident in prison in which he had “come real close to killing\na [prison] guard” and that “[t]he only reason” he did not was that someone else\nstopped him. 67 He explained that “one of these days” there would not be\nsomeone to stop him, and he would “end up killing again.” 68 Austin contested\nat closing the State’s contention that he was a pedophile, asserting that J.O.\nlooked older than she was. 69 He stated he was homosexual and described his\nsexual preferences. 70 Austin concluded his closing, telling the jury:\n      On these special issues, there’s no doubt that you will answer yes\n      to No. 1 because if you send me to prison, I will commit further acts\n      of violence. . . . Jail is a violent place, especially for somebody like\n      me. I’m a homosexual. So, yes, I will commit further acts of\n      violence in prison. Special Issue No. 2, there was no mitigating\n      circumstances that contributed to killing [D.K.]. And fear, anger\n      or whatever can never be considered anywhere near a reason for\n      killing. So I suspect, you know, y’all, by law, have to answer that\n      number as no. 71\n\n\n\n      65 11RR15.\n      66 11RR15-16.\n      67 11RR16.\n      68 Id.\n      69 11RR16-17, 19.\n      70 11RR18.\n      71 11RR19-20.\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 13-70024      Document: 00514256173         Page: 12    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\nThe jury answered Texas’s special issues such that the trial court imposed a\ndeath sentence. 72\n       The state trial court held a second Faretta hearing in which Austin\nwaived his right to both appellate counsel and state habeas counsel. 73 The\ncourt noted it had previously determined before trial that Austin was\ncompetent and it appointed standby appellate counsel. 74 Pursuant to Texas\nlaw, Austin’s case was automatically appealed to the Texas Court of Criminal\nAppeals (TCCA). 75 Austin filed no brief. The TCCA affirmed his conviction,\nnoting that Austin had chosen to represent himself at trial and on appeal and\nthat the “trial court [had] fully admonished [him] of the dangers and\ndisadvantages of self-representation prior to trial and prior to this appeal.” 76\nThe TCCA stated it had, in the interests of justice, reviewed the entire record\nand found no unassigned fundamental error. 77\n       Austin waived any pursuit of post-conviction relief and the trial court set\nAustin’s execution date. 78 Six days before his scheduled execution, Austin\nmoved to have state habeas counsel appointed. 79 The trial court withdrew the\nexecution date and appointed Dick Wheelan as habeas counsel on September\n24, 2003. 80\n\n\n\n\n       72 11RR31; CR at 78-79.\n       73 12RR3, 8; CR at 84-85.\n       74 CR at 86; ROA.22; ROA.595.\n       75 See TEX.

After his suicide attempt in 1975, he was\nhospitalized and diagnosed with adolescent adjustment reaction in a mixed\npersonality. 100 Austin subsequently joined the army but was discharged in\n1977 for “failure to adapt socially and emotionally.” 101                    Following the\naggravated rape of his sister and attempted aggravated rape of another of his\nsisters, as well as the aggravated robbery of a third sister and his mother in\n1978, 102 Austin was evaluated by a psychologist, Dr. Franklin Lewis, before\nthe trial occurred on those charges. 103 Dr. Lewis diagnosed Austin with severe\npersonality disturbance with schizoid thinking and anti-social features as well\nas latent borderline schizophrenia. 104 He concluded that Austin was, at the\ntime, suffering from a mental illness. 105 Austin pleaded not guilty due to\ninsanity. 106 At trial, Dr. Lewis testified that there were indications that Austin\nhad brain dysfunction or brain damage, although further testing would be\nrequired to make a determination. 107 Austin again attempted suicide in 1979\n\n\n       98  ROA.1930; ROA.2126.\n       99  See Second Amended Pet. at 13; ROA.607; ROA.610.\n        100 Second Amended Pet. at 14; ROA.607 (same assertion in first amended petition).\n        101 Second Amended Pet. at 15.\n        102 Pet.

Dr. McGarrahan concluded that Austin “has a chronic issue with\nsuicidal depression and that his suicidal depression appears to have been\npresent at the time of his trial and competency evaluation . . . and likely\nimpaired his ability to reason and make sound judgments.” 144 Dr. Woods\n\n\n        138 Pet.

He stated:\n      I wish to drop my appeals but can’t seem to get any type of response\n      nor cooperation. I have informed my attorney of my wishes and\n      according to him, to drop my appeals m[a]y actually prolong the\n      date of my execution because the courts would then request a\n      competency hearing. If there is any way I could waive the\n      compentency [sic] hearing I would gladly do it. I was given a\n      competency hearing just before my trial, and another just after,\n      but before my direct appeals by the trial court. I was found\n      competent in both of those instances and see no reason for another\n      one.\n\n\n\n\n      145  ROA.2174.\n      146  ROA.2177.\n       147 Austin v.

My TDCJ IQ score was 123\n      and my TDCJ EA Score was 12.9. Again, this is hardly a sign of\n      incompetence. I do have a history of mental health issues, but\n      nothing that can't be treated satisfactorily with medication and\n      counseling. I chose to abstain from medication and counseling\n      though and so see no reason why my mental health should keep\n      me from dropping my appeals. Also, I recently read a court case in\n      which your court ruled that a person could be mentally ill, but still\n      be competent to be executed because that person was competent\n      during their trial. In that case, that should also be the case in my\n      case/appeals. 149\n\nWe requested that the State and Austin’s counsel respond to Austin’s request\nto withdraw his appeals. Austin’s counsel stated that Austin continues to\nsuffer from serious mental illness and that nothing in Austin’s letter\n“cause[d] . . . counsel to [abandon] the legal and factual propositions” advanced\nin the habeas petition and the COA. 150 Austin’s counsel subsequently filed a\nmotion for expedited consideration of the COA. 151 We noted that this motion\nconflicted with Austin’s request to withdraw and we remanded to the district\ncourt “for the limited purpose of making findings as to whether Austin [was]\npresently competent to waive further appeals of his conviction and death\nsentence, and if Austin [was] found to be competent, whether such waiver is\nknowing and voluntary.” 152 We subsequently received a letter from Austin,\n\n\n\n\n      149 Docket Entry # 47 (letter from Austin to the Fifth Circuit received Sept. 17, 2014).\n      150 Docket Entry # 53 (filed Oct. 9, 2014).\n      151 Docket Entry # 62 (filed Nov. 14, 2014).\n      152 Austin v.

I wish to be executed. Either that, or give me Life Without\n      Parole. One or the other. . . . I do not want out of prison. I am\n      probably one of the very few guys in prison who readily admit that\n      I belong in prison. . . . When I was first bench warranted back to\n      the county jail in 2001 I was asked what was it I wanted. I asked\n      if I could be guaranteed a Life sentence without ever being brought\n      up for parole. When I was told that couldn’t be guaranteed, I chose\n      death. If you looked at the trial transcript and everything else you\n      can see that at no point did I contest the state. I only picked up\n      my appeals because in a moment of weakness I allowed a woman\n      to convince me to pick them up. That woman is no longer a factor\n      in my life. 162\n\n      In November, 2015, Austin sent another letter to this court requesting\ndenial of his appeal. 163 He restated that he had taken psychology classes, was\n“good [at] manipulation,” and had                deceived     mental     health experts\npreviously. 164 This court subsequently granted in part and denied in part\nAustin’s COA. 165      In November 2016, Austin again wrote to the court\nrequesting a denial of his appeal. 166           In reference to the claims raised\nconcerning his mental health issues, Austin stated he “[could] guarantee this\ncourt that I am now, and always have been fully competent.” 167 He again\nsuggested he had previously deceived mental health experts and manipulated\n\n\n\n\n      161 Id.\n      162 Id.\n      163 Docket Entry # 97 (letter from Austin to the Fifth Circuit filed Nov. 20, 2015).\n      164 Id.\n      165 Austin v.

He also\ncontends that regardless of whether the state trial court’s initial pretrial\nfinding of competency was proper, the information about his mental health\nhistory presented at trial should have alerted the state trial court then to the\npossibility that Austin was not competent—in other words, the information\ncreated a bona fide doubt as to Austin’s competency such that an additional\nhearing was necessary.\n      Because we conclude that Austin has failed to demonstrate by clear and\nconvincing evidence that he was not competent to stand trial, waive counsel,\nor plead guilty, we similarly reject his procedural claim that the state trial\ncourt was required to hold a pretrial competency hearing and that because it\ndid not, he was denied a fair trial. In concluding that Austin could waive\ncounsel and proceed pro se, the state trial court made an implicit finding that\nno bona fide doubt as to competency existed and that a standalone competency\nhearing was therefore not required. 216 We presume that this factual finding is\ncorrect under § 2254(e)(1) and, as noted above, Austin has failed to overcome\nthat presumption by clear and convincing evidence. If we were to consider, in\nthe alternative, the competency determination as a mixed question of law and\nfact subject to de novo review, rather than a purely factual finding, Austin has\nstill failed to demonstrate he was not competent. We therefore conclude that\nthis procedural claim is without merit.\n      Nor is Austin entitled to relief based on his claim that the state trial\ncourt failed to inquire about Austin’s competency adequately after hearing\n\n\n\n      215   Id.

Austin contends that his mental illness and the conditions of his\nconfinement rendered both his guilty plea and his waiver of trial counsel\ninvalid because they were not knowing and voluntary. 240              In light of our\nconclusion that the trial court’s finding of competency was well-supported and\ncorrect even if reviewed de novo as a mixed question of law and fact, the\nevidence of depression or other mental illness does not render an otherwise\n\n\n\n\n       234  See id.\n       235  9RR4.\n        236 9RR4-5 (“Has anyone reached any agreement with you to get you to enter your\n\nplea?”; “Has anybody promised you anything to get you to enter your plea?”; “Has anybody\nthreatened you to get you to enter your plea?”).\n        237 9RR5.\n        238 Id.\n        239 9RR6.\n        240 Austin Br. at 102.\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 39     Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\neffective waiver involuntary. 241 Similarly, Austin has failed to demonstrate\nthat the conditions of his confinement rendered his decisions involuntary or\nundermined his otherwise effective waiver.

The fact that Austin\nsought the death penalty is not, in and of itself, sufficient to call into serious\ndoubt his competence to proceed to trial in light of the other evidence before\nthe court. His letters and colloquy with the judge do not suggest an inability\nto understand the proceedings or charges against him. To the contrary, Austin\nremained articulate and focused in his aim of representing himself and\nrefusing to present a defense. 253 The court-ordered independent evaluation\nfurther supports the state trial court’s conclusion that Austin was, in fact,\ncompetent to represent himself at trial. 254 Finally, though Austin details\nvarious psychiatric treatments, interactions with mental health professionals,\nand the opinions of experts hired post-conviction, nothing suggests he suffered\nany impairment that would bear on his competency to stand trial. 255 Even if\n\n\n\n\n       250Bell v.

If you kill\n      someone you should face the death penalty.\n            Once someone is guilty of capital murder I believe that the\n      only appropriate penalty is the death penalty. I do not think that\n      there is anything that would be mitigating so that a person should\n      not get the death penalty, this includes the person being insane.\n            Once I heard that Perry Austin had admitted to\n      intentionally killing a nine year old boy I was only going to vote\n      one way—I was going to vote ‘yes’ he was a future danger and ‘no’\n\n      270   5RR32-33, 38-40, 43-44.\n\n                                          46\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173       Page: 47    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 13-70024\n      there was nothing mitigating. I was not going to vote for anything\n      other than the death penalty. 271\n\n\n      The voir dire and post-trial statements of the other four jurors are set\nforth in section VI(C) below. As noted, Austin relies only on the post-trial\nstatements to support his contention that each of these jurors was dishonest\nin answering questions posed during voir dire. We conclude that the district\ncourt was foreclosed from considering any of the jurors’ post-trial statements\nby Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b)(1) and the Supreme Court’s decisions\napplying that Rule. Therefore, the district court did not err in failing to grant\nhabeas relief on Austin’s juror bias claim.\n      Rule 606(b)(1) provides:\n            (b) During an Inquiry Into the Validity of a Verdict or\n      Indictment.\n             (1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence. During an\n      inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not\n      testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during\n      the jury's deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror's or\n      another juror's vote; or any juror's mental processes concerning the\n      verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror's affidavit\n      or evidence of a juror's statement on these matters. 272\n      The text of the rule is clear, and it explicitly directs that “a juror may not\ntestify about . . . the effect of anything on that juror’s . . . vote . . . or any juror’s\nmental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.” The Rule further\nprovides, “[t]he court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s\nstatement on these matters.” Each of the post-trial statements by jurors comes\nwithin these prohibitions.\n\n\n      271   Pet.

Shauers that “Rule 606(b)\napplies to juror testimony during a proceeding in which a party seeks to secure\na new trial on the ground that a juror lied during voir dire.” 273 The Court\nrejected the argument that the inquiry under McDonough “begins and ends\nwith what happened during voir dire,” and therefore that Rule 606(b) should\nbe inapplicable. 274 The Court reasoned that “[w]hether or not a juror’s alleged\nmisconduct during voir dire had a direct effect on the jury’s verdict, the motion\nfor a new trial requires a court to determine whether the verdict can stand.” 275\nThe Court further explained:\n       [A] party’s right to an impartial jury remains protected despite\n       Rule 606(b)’s removal of one means of ensuring that jurors are\n       unbiased. Even if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that conceals bias,\n       juror impartiality is adequately assured by the parties’ ability to\n       bring to the court’s attention any evidence of bias before the verdict\n       is rendered, and to employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict\n       is rendered. 276\n\n       The Ninth Circuit has similarly applied Rule 606(b) in a direct criminal\nappeal in which a juror’s post-trial affidavit averred that other jurors had\ndiscussed the evidence against the defendant “and made up their minds about\nhis guilt before the start of deliberations.” 277 In denying relief, the court\nexplained that “[t]he notion that egregious juror conduct will not necessarily\nresult in relief from the verdict may seem antithetical to our system of due\n\n\n\n       273 Warger v.

Rule 606(b) does\n      not bar admission of post-trial statements to prove that the jurors\n      failed to answer a material question honestly during voir dire. 284\n\n      That analysis was clearly incorrect in light of the Supreme Court’s\ndecision and reasoning in Warger v. Shauers, and, after full briefing and\nplenary consideration, we now disavow our prior reasoning and our discussion\nof Rule 606(b) in granting a COA on Austin’s jury bias claim. Though we cited\nWarger in a footnote, our analysis of that decision was not in-depth and was\ninaccurate. 285\n      This court’s decision in Hatten v. Quarterman, 286 which we also cited in\na footnote in our opinion and order granting a COA on Austin’s jury bias\nclaim, 287 involved unusual circumstances and does not support Austin’s\ncontention that the post-trial statements at issue are admissible to impeach\nthe jury’s verdict and require a new trial. In Hatten, questions as to whether\na juror had been truthful during voir dire and was biased were raised in the\nmidst of trial, before the case was submitted to the jury. 288 The juror in\n\n\n\n      284 Austin v.

Only an implication can be drawn from Hatten\nthat if a post-trial affidavit demonstrated a juror’s bias, the affidavit could be\nused to impeach the verdict and a new trial would be necessary. An implication\nis not a holding.

They were only asked whether they could potentially answer the\nspecial issues so as to impose a life sentence if the law and evidence so required.\nWe also note that the record reflects that the murder victim’s age, nine years\nold, was not revealed to the jurors until the punishment phase commenced,\nwhich was after voir dire had been completed. 297\n      Juror Erwin\n      The relevant portion of Juror Erwin’s voir dire consisted of the following\nexchanges:\n            THE COURT: And if the evidence called for it, [could you]\n      answer [the special issue] in such a way that you know a life\n      sentence would result?\n            ERWIN: Yes.\n            THE COURT: I take it, then, sir, that you would listen to the\n      evidence, follow the law and be guided by the evidence and the law,\n      wherever that might take you in this trial?\n            ERWIN: Whatever that is, yes.\n            ...\n            ERWIN: There’s a few cases I think you should get the death\n      penalty, but that’s just me.\n            PROSECUTION: Okay, and that would be what?

The only thing that\n      would make that different is if the person was insane.\n             After Perry Austin admitted he did the murder the case was\n      pretty simple. He wanted the death penalty and we were happy to\n      give it to him. 299\n\n      The first paragraph of the post-trial statement reflects Erwin’s beliefs as\nof the date of the statement. It does not say that Erwin held these beliefs at\nthe time of voir dire. Two years after a trial, a juror’s beliefs may have changed,\nparticularly after participating in a capital trial and voting to impose a death\nsentence.       But even if Erwin thought during voir dire that the only\ncircumstance warranting a life sentence as opposed to a death sentence would\nbe insanity when the crime was committed, his responses to the questions he\nwas asked during voir dire are consistent with that view. He was not asked to\nidentify what factors would cause him to vote in favor of a life sentence. He\nwas only asked if there were circumstances in which he could vote for a life\nsentence, and his post-trial statement confirms that there was at least one such\ncircumstance.\n\n\n\n\n      298   4RR18-31.\n      299   Pet.

Nothing\nin the second paragraph is an assertion that the evidence called for a life\nsentence but that Erwin ignored that evidence. Erwin was not required to vote\nfor a life sentence simply because there was mitigating evidence.        Austin\nadmitted to murdering a child, and during his pro se closing statement, Austin\nhimself set forth facts that he said supported answering the two special issues\nin a way that would result in a death sentence. Erwin’s brief characterization\nin his post-trial statement of why the jury voted as it did does not contradict\nanything that Erwin said during voir dire. In fact, Erwin candidly revealed\nduring voir dire that he thought that someone who killed an elderly person or\na child should receive the death penalty. We do not consider whether there\nmay have been cause to strike Erwin based on his voir dire testimony or his\npost-trial statement because Austin has not met the first prong of McDonough,\nthat Erwin was dishonest during voir dire.

Other than showing that it was an accident or the person\n     was insane I do not think that any other considerations are\n     relevant. If you are found guilty of capital murder you should get\n     the death penalty.\n     ...\n           When I was asked at the time the jury was selected whether\n     I could consider voting for life I said yes and I was thinking about\n     a situation where someone was insane and did not know what they\n     were doing. 301\n\n\n\n\n     300   5RR5-17.\n     301   Pet.

It does not say that Condon held these view\nduring voir dire. But even if he held those views during voir dire, nothing in\nthe first paragraph or the second paragraph contradicts Condon’s voir dire\ntestimony. When asked to “tell us in your own words what your feelings are\non the death penalty,” Condon responded, “[i]f someone commits a\npremeditated act of violence against someone else, I think it’s justifiable they\nbe repaid in kind.” That is a categorical statement. It is entirely consistent\nwith both the first and second paragraphs of Condon’s post-trial statement, as\nis Condon’s statement during voir dire that “I just feel that certain crimes\ndeserve the ultimate punishment.” Condon was not asked during voir dire\nwhether the only circumstance that would cause him to vote for a life sentence\nwould be the insanity of the defendant. Austin has not established the first\nrequirement of McDonough, which is that Condon failed to answer honestly a\nmaterial question.\n      Juror Gibbs\n      Gibbs’s voir dire contained the following exchanges:\n             THE COURT: And if the evidence called for it, [could you]\n      answer [the special issues] in such a way that you know a life\n      sentence would result?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             THE COURT: I take it, then – and correct me if I’m wrong –\n      that you would be guided by the evidence, listen to all of the\n      evidence and answer the questions according to the evidence,\n      wherever that might take you?\n             GIBBS: Yes.\n             ...\n             PROSECUTION: . . . Tell us first in your own words, what\n      are your feelings on the death penalty?\n             GIBBS: I am for it and - - I’m for it. I think it’s necessary\n      for a crime deterrent, and that’s about it.\n\n                                      57\n\fCase: 13-70024    Document: 00514256173     Page: 58   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                             No. 13-70024\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . Okay.

Do you feel that you can participate in\n  that - - the deliberations, deliberating with the jury and assess the\n  death penalty if the law and the evidence supports it?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . are you saying that if you know that\n  the defendant is representing himself and you know that he has a\n  death wish, if the law and the evidence supports assessing the\n  death penalty, are you saying you still could not assess the death\n  penalty?\n         THE COURT: In other words, if the evidence called for\n  answering those questions in such a way that you answered the\n  first one yes and the second one no, you know the death penalty\n  would result?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         THE COURT: Would the fact that you feel that you would be\n  giving a defendant something that he wanted cause you in any way\n  to change your answers based on the evidence?\n         GIBBS: No.\n         THE COURT: So, then, would you - - would you, I guess,\n  honor your oath as a juror and base your verdict to those questions\n  on the evidence; and if that’s what the evidence proved to you, you\n  would answer them in that way?\n         GIBBS: Yes.\n         THE COURT: Even if you feel like it’s kind of unfair to give\n  him what he would want?\n         GIBBS: Exactly. That’s just the way that I feel. That’s not\n  the way that - - if that’s what the law states, then that’s how, I\n  guess, I would have to vote. But I mean - -\n         THE COURT: Your personal opinion - -\n                                   58\n\f   Case: 13-70024       Document: 00514256173       Page: 59   Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\n            GIBBS: Personal feelings, I would have to say no; but I\n      would say I would vote the death penalty if that’s what the law\n      stated and - -\n            THE COURT: And the evidence showed?\n            GIBBS: Yes. 302\n\nIn his post-trial statement, Juror Gibbs made the following assertions:\n            I believe that ‘an eye for an eye’ is correct. If you kill\n      someone you should face the death penalty.\n            Once someone is guilty of capital murder I believe that the\n      only appropriate penalty is the death penalty. I do not think that\n      there is anything that would be mitigating so that a person should\n      not get the death penalty, this includes the person being insane.\n            Once I heard that Perry Austin had admitted to\n      intentionally killing a nine year old boy I was only going to vote\n      one way—I was going to vote ‘yes’ he was a future danger and ‘no’\n      there was nothing mitigating. I was not going to vote for anything\n      other than the death penalty. 303\n\n\n      The first two paragraphs reflect Gibbs’ belief as of the date of his\nstatement. They are not evidence that he held these views during voir dire.\nThe third paragraph reflects Gibbs’ weighing of all the evidence. As discussed\nabove, there is no evidence that before or during voir dire, Gibbs had “heard\nthat Perry Austin had admitted to intentionally killing a nine year old boy.”\nThe record reflects that D.K.’s age was not in evidence until after voir dire. 304\nWhen the facts were presented during trial, Austin gave the fact that Austin\nintentionally killed a nine-year-old child controlling weight. He did not say he\nwould do otherwise in his voir dire testimony.\n      Juror Tamayo\n\n\n\n      302 5RR32-33, 38-40, 43-44.\n      303 Pet.

I’m for it.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: . . . You may hear something that’s\n  sufficient enough for you that you think even though he’s a capital\n  murderer and he’s probably going to be dangerous, he ought to\n  receive life instead of death. Okay. Does that question make sense\n  to you?\n         TAMAYO: It does.\n         ...\n         PROSECUTION: If you were the king and it’s your kingdom\n  and you get to write the laws, would your kingdom have a death\n  penalty?\n         TAMAYO: Well, yeah.

Hypothetically, let’s assume during\n  the course of the trial, if you’re selected to sit on the jury, you find\n  out not only that he’s representing himself but that he has a death\n  wish. He’s not asking any questions. He just sits there, and he\n  wants y’all to give him the death penalty. How does that make you\n  feel?\n\n                                    60\n\f    Case: 13-70024      Document: 00514256173         Page: 61    Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 13-70024\n            TAMAYO: Well, it’s not whether he wants it or not. It’s just\n       whether it’s given to him or not.\n            PROSECUTION: Based on the law and evidence?\n            TAMAYO: Right. 305\nJuror Tamayo’s post-trial statement contained the following:\n             The death penalty is especially appropriate for child killers.\n       I do not consider mental illness to be mitigation because it is too\n       easy for defendants to lie and manipulate circumstances. 306\n\n\n       Tamayo’s post-trial statement does not say that he held these views\nduring voir dire. The statement reflects his beliefs two years after trial. In\nany event, the statement expresses the weight that Tamayo would give to two\nfactors. His belief that the death penalty is especially appropriate for child\nkillers and that he does not consider mental illness to be mitigating is simply\nhow he weighs such evidence. He does not consider mental illness to be “a\nsufficient mitigating circumstance,” and the special issue asked only if there is\n“a sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances.” If Austin’s position\nwere correct, a prospective juror would be required to confirm during voir dire\nthat he or she would vote for a life sentence if there were evidence of mental\nillness, at least in some circumstances. Neither the law nor the issues put to\nAustin’s jury requires this. The Supreme Court has long recognized that\nevidence of mental illness is a two-edged sword when a jury is deciding whether\na death sentence is appropriate. 307\n       Juror Finnegan\n       Juror Finnegan’s voir dire proceeded, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n\n       305 5RR46-60.\n       306 Pet.

I believe that the prosecutors chose me to be on\n       Austin’s jury because Perry wanted to die and Perry knew that\n       with me working in law enforcement I would sentence him to\n       death. Perry allowed me to stay on his jury. 309\n\n       Nothing in Finnegan’s post-trial statement indicates that he was\ndishonest in responding to questions during voir dire. Finnegan’s statement\nrefers to “the victim,” not murder victims generically. Finnegan did not say\nthat he would automatically vote for the death penalty in every case. 310 The\nvictim in this case was a nine-year-old boy. For the reasons discussed above,\nFinnegan’s post-trial statement is evidence of the weight that he gave to the\nnature of the crime, not evidence that Finnegan failed to respond truthfully to\ninquiries during voir dire.\n       None of the post-trial statements establish that a juror answered a\nquestion dishonestly during voir dire.\n\n\n\n\n       308 5RR66-83.\n       309 Pet.

The record amply supports, and in fact compels, the conclusion\nthat Austin had resolved to accept all jurors that the State accepted and that\nif, during voir dire, the five jurors had expressed the views contained in their\npost-trial statements, Austin would not have challenged any of those jurors for\ncause, because Austin’s trial strategy was to obtain the death penalty. Austin\ncannot now claim in a habeas proceeding that had he known the jurors’ actual\nviews, or had he known that they had predilections and a bias in favor of the\ndeath penalty, he would have challenged them for cause and thereby preserved\nthe issue for appeal or collateral review. The record is clear that he would not\nhave challenged any of the five jurors for cause during the trial even had there\nbeen a basis for doing so.\n      It is undisputed that when voir dire occurred, Austin intended to plead\nguilty, and after the jurors were seated, Austin entered a guilty plea in their\npresence.   The jury was empaneled only to decide whether Austin would\nreceive a life sentence or a death sentence. During closing arguments, Austin\npersonally argued to the jury that, because of the nature of his crime and\nbecause of his past and future dangerousness, it should answer the two\nquestions submitted in a way that would require imposition of the death\npenalty. The Supreme Court has never held that, consistent with a defendant’s\ntrial strategy, a defendant may knowingly accept a biased juror and then, after\na change of heart in collateral proceedings, obtain automatic reversal because\nof that juror’s bias.\n                                       67\n\f    Case: 13-70024        Document: 00514256173          Page: 68      Date Filed: 11/30/2017\n\n\n\n                                        No. 13-70024\n       To the contrary, the Supreme Court explained in McDonough Power\nEquipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, the primary case on which Austin relies, that\n“[i]t is not clear from the opinion of the Court of Appeals whether the\ninformation stated in Greenwood’s affidavit was known to respondents or their\ncounsel at the time of the voir dire examination.” 8 Importantly, the Court\nadmonished that “[i]f it were, of course, [defendants] would be barred from\nlater challenging the composition of the jury when they had chosen not to\ninterrogate [the potentially biased juror] further upon receiving an answer\nwhich they thought to be factually incorrect.” 9 The Supreme Court cited a\ndecision from the Eighth Circuit in support of this conclusion, 10 which held\nthat “‘[t]he right to challenge the panel or to challenge a particular juror may\nbe waived, and in fact is waived by failure to seasonably object.’” 11 The Eighth\nCircuit explained that\n       It is established that failure to object at the time the jury is\n       empaneled operates as a conclusive waiver if the basis of the\n       objection is known of [sic] might have been known or discovered\n       through the exercise of reasonable diligence, or if the party is\n       otherwise chargeable with knowledge of the ground of the\n       objection. 12\n\n\n\n       8 McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v.

He has not asserted in habeas\nproceedings that his counsel (himself) was ineffective for failing to question\nthese jurors during voir dire or for failing to challenge them for cause. His only\ncontention is that, if he had known during voir dire the substance of the five\njurors’ post-trial statements, he would have had grounds to challenge each of\nthem for cause. If grounds to remove them for cause did exist, and had those\ngrounds been revealed during voir dire, then it would have been incumbent\nupon Austin actually to raise challenges for cause. Otherwise, as the Eighth\nCircuit cogently explained, “‘[i]f a defendant is allowed to . . . forego challenges\nfor-cause to a biased juror and then allowed to have the conviction reversed on\nappeal because of that juror’s service, that would be equivalent to allowing the\ndefendant to plant an error and grow a risk-free trial.’” 16\n       It rings hollow for Austin now to contend that had he known the five\njurors’ views he would have challenged them for cause. Austin’s actions, and\nmore importantly inactions, in declining to ask any questions during voir dire,\ndeciding before trial to accept all jurors the State accepted, and declining to\nexercise any preemptory challenges are entirely consistent with his trial\nstrategy, which he set forth in letters to the trial court. Prior to trial, Austin\nadvised the trial court that he was “still firm about [his] decision to not fight\nthis case” and that “since [he was] not going to put up any type of defense,” he\nhad “decided that it [was] not necessary for [him] to review [his] case file.” 17\n       The Supreme Court has never held that juror bias is structural error\nrequiring automatic reversal.

It is also unclear whether 28 U.S.C. § 2111\napplies. It provides that “[o]n the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in\nany case, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record\nwithout regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of\nthe parties.” 61 It would seem that in many if not most cases when both prongs\nof McDonough are met the impact on the trial would obviously be injurious or\nthe substantial rights of a party would be affected. But the present case is a\nrelatively unusual one.       To the extent that the analysis set forth by the\nSupreme Court in Fry v. Pliler, 62 and Brecht v. Abrahamson 63 applies, any\nconstitutional error that occurred because any one of the five challenged jurors\nparticipated in the verdict did not have a substantial and injurious impact on\nthe verdict.\n      In assessing harmlessness on direct review, the Government bears the\nburden of proving that a constitutional error was “harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” 64 On collateral review, however, “concerns about finality,\ncomity, and federalism,” 65 mandate that a federal habeas petitioner bears the\n\n\n\n      61 28 U.S.C. § 2111.\n      62 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145720\"><a href=\"/opinion/145720/fry-v-pliler/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007).\n      63 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112845\"><a href=\"/opinion/112845/brecht-v-abrahamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).\n      64 Chapman v.
