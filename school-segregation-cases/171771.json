No. ECU01642)\n\nTHERESA A.H. CASON et al.,\n\n         Defendants and Respondents.\n\n\n         APPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court of Imperial County, Barrett J.\n\nFoerster and Donal B. Donnelly, Judges. Affirmed.\n\n\n\n         Plaintiff Gregory B.H. Cason (Plaintiff) appeals a judgment apportioning attorney\n\nfees and costs incurred in his partition action against defendants Theresa A.H. Cason,\n\nalso known as Theresa H. Schoneman, Donald S. Cason, David B.H. Cason and Diane\n\nCason, as trustees of the David Cason and Diane Cason 2000 Family Trust (together\n\nDefendants). On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court abused its discretion by\n\napportioning attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action for the common\n\fbenefit of the parties on an equitable basis of 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to\n\nDefendants.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On October 30, 2003, Plaintiff filed a complaint requesting partition of certain real\n\nproperty owned by Plaintiff and Defendants in cotenancy, commonly known as \"Elder\n\nCanal, Gates 9 & 10\" and consisting of about 160 acres (Property). The complaint\n\nalleged Plaintiff and each of the three Defendants owned an undivided one-fourth interest\n\nin the Property. It sought partition by sale of the Property, alleging a sale would be more\n\nequitable than division in kind because the Property is farm land and too small to be\n\ndivided into parcels that can be economically farmed. Defendants answered the\n\ncomplaint, opposing partition by sale and, in the event the trial court ordered partition of\n\nthe Property, requesting that Plaintiff be allotted a parcel according to his one-fourth\n\ninterest and Defendants be allotted a parcel according to their collective three-fourths\n\ninterest.\n\n       On May 11, 2005, the trial court entered an interlocutory judgment directing\n\npartition of the Property according to the parties' interests and ordering that a referee be\n\nappointed to recommend division and partition the Property. The court further ordered\n\nthat \"if a division of the [Property] is impracticable or that a sale of the [Property], or any\n\nportion thereof, would be more equitable to the parties, the referee shall so state in the\n\nreport and set forth recommendations as to the sale of [the Property], or portion thereof,\n\nand the Court shall enter such further orders as the Court may deem proper and\n\nappropriate.\"\n\n                                               2\n\f       The appointed referee subsequently issued a report finding there were four\n\nplausible methods to partition the Property: (1) sell the Property and distribute the\n\nproceeds to the parties on a pro rata basis; (2) have those parties who do not want to sell\n\nthe Property purchase the interests of those parties who do want to sell it; (3) divide the\n\nProperty into one 120-acre parcel and one 40-acre parcel; and (4) divide the Property into\n\nfour 40-acre parcels. The referee recommended the fourth option as the best long-term\n\nsolution. After receiving the responses of the parties to the referee's report, the trial court\n\nordered the referee to conduct a further evaluation of the Property. In his second report,\n\nthe referee recommended that Plaintiff be awarded the southeast quarter of the Property\n\nbecause of drop box and harvesting issues.\n\n       On November 21, 2006, the trial court issued an order directing the Property to be\n\npartitioned in kind into four parcels of 40 acres each within one year and, if the partition\n\nwas not accomplished within one year, the Property was to be partitioned into one parcel\n\nconsisting of the southeast one-fourth and one parcel consisting of the remainder of the\n\nProperty. However, a subsequent survey apparently showed the Property consisted of\n\nonly about 159, and not 160, acres. Because zoning ordinances of Imperial County\n\n(County) require farm land parcels to be at least 40 acres, County apparently rejected the\n\nproposed division of the Property into four separate 40-acre parcels.\n\n       On April 3, 2008, based on counsel's representations that County rejected partition\n\nof the Property into four separate parcels, the trial court issued an order directing division\n\nof the Property into two parcels: (1) a southeast quarter consisting of 40 acres in\n\ncompliance with County's zoning ordinances; and (2) the remaining property (consisting\n\n                                               3\n\fof about 119 acres). The 40-acre parcel was awarded to Plaintiff and the other parcel was\n\nawarded to Defendants. The court reserved jurisdiction to consider a motion on the issue\n\nof whether owelty should be awarded.\n\n       The parties stipulated to the appointment of an appraiser, Matt Ramsey, to report\n\non the amount of owelty Plaintiff may owe Defendants. The appraiser determined\n\nPlaintiff's 40-acre parcel was worth $350,000 and Defendants' 119-acre parcel was worth\n\n$680,000. Plaintiff objected to the appraisal and requested that owelty be determined\n\nbased instead on an appraisal made by William S. Smith. Smith's appraisal valued\n\nPlaintiff's parcel at $5,200 per acre and Defendants' parcel at $5,000 per acre. Following\n\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued an order finding Plaintiff owed Defendants\n\nowelty of $7,250, adopting the valuations in Smith's appraisal.\n\n       Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 874.010 and 874.040,1 Plaintiff filed\n\na motion for apportionment of attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action.\n\nDefendants filed a motion for apportionment of costs only and requested those costs be\n\napportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and Defendants (50 percent).\n\nDefendants opposed Plaintiff's motion for apportionment of attorney fees and costs\n\nbecause they were not incurred for the common benefit of the parties.\n\n       On September 2, 2010, the trial court heard counsel's arguments on both motions.\n\nThe court granted Plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs, which \"shall be equitably\n\napportioned between the parties with Plaintiff being responsible for fifty percent thereof\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                             4\n\fand the remaining three defendants being responsible for the remaining fifty percent.\"\n\nThe Court found that \"though all parties enjoyed a common benefit in the pursuit of the\n\npartition action, that benefit was not equal between them. Only Plaintiff received a\n\ncomplete partition of his interest. The remaining [D]efendants' interests in the subject\n\nreal property have not been individually partitioned.\" The court set a further hearing on\n\nDefendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees, if filed, and their motion for\n\napportionment of costs.\n\n       Defendants subsequently filed a motion for apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, requesting they be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Plaintiff opposed their motion, arguing the motion was filed\n\nlate. On March 9, 2011, the court issued a written order apportioning attorney fees and\n\ncosts incurred by the parties in the partition action, to be apportioned 50 percent to\n\nPlaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. On May 9, 2011, the court entered a final\n\njudgment partitioning the Property into two parcels as described above and apportioning\n\nthe parties' attorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. 2\n\nPlaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n2      Because Plaintiff does not dispute the trial court's determination of the amounts of\nattorney fees and costs incurred for the common benefit of the parties, we need not, and\ndo not, set forth the specific amounts apportioned by the court.\n\n                                              5\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n                                                I\n\n                                     Standard of Review\n\n       \"The standard of review on issues of attorney's fees and costs is abuse of\n\ndiscretion. The trial court's decision will only be disturbed when there is no substantial\n\nevidence to support the trial court's findings or when there has been a miscarriage of\n\njustice. If the trial court has made no findings, the reviewing court will infer all findings\n\nnecessary to support the judgment and then examine the record to see if the findings are\n\nbased on substantial evidence.\" (Finney v. Gomez (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 527, 545, fns.\n\nomitted.)\n\n       When an appellant asserts there is insufficient evidence to support a factual\n\nfinding, we apply the substantial evidence standard of review, requiring two steps. \"First,\n\none must resolve all explicit conflicts in the evidence in favor of the respondent and\n\npresume in favor of the judgment all reasonable inferences. [Citation.] Second, one\n\nmust determine whether the evidence thus marshaled is substantial. While it is\n\ncommonly stated that our 'power' begins and ends with a determination that there is\n\nsubstantial evidence [citation], this does not mean we must blindly seize any evidence in\n\nsupport of the respondent in order to affirm the judgment. . . . [Citation.] '[I]f the word\n\n\"substantial\" [is to mean] anything at all, it clearly implies that such evidence must be of\n\nponderable legal significance. Obviously the word cannot be deemed synonymous with\n\n\"any\" evidence. It must be reasonable . . . , credible, and of solid value . . . .' [Citation.]\n\nThe ultimate determination is whether a reasonable trier of fact could have found for the\n\n                                               6\n\frespondent based on the whole record.\" (Kuhn v. Department of General Services (1994)\n\n22 Cal.App.4th 1627, 1632-1633, fns. omitted.) \"[T]he power of an appellate court\n\nbegins and ends with the determination as to whether, on the entire record, there is\n\nsubstantial evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the\n\ndetermination, and when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the\n\nfacts, a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial\n\ncourt. If such substantial evidence be found, it is of no consequence that the trial court\n\nbelieving other evidence, or drawing other reasonable inferences, might have reached a\n\ncontrary conclusion.\" (Bowers v. Bernards (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873-874.)\n\n                                              II\n\n                 Trial Court's Apportionment of Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Plaintiff contends the trial court abused its discretion by apportioning attorney fees\n\nand costs incurred for the common benefit of the parties on an equitable basis 50 percent\n\nto Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants rather than in proportion to the interests of the\n\nparties in the property. He asserts there is insufficient evidence to support the court's\n\napportionment of attorney fees and costs.\n\n                                              A\n\n       Section 874.040 provides: \"Except as otherwise provided in this article, the court\n\nshall apportion the costs of partition among the parties in proportion to their interests or\n\nmake such other apportionment as may be equitable.\" The Law Revision Commission\n\nComment to section 874.040 states:\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f           \"Although normally the costs of partition are apportioned in\n           proportion to the interests of the parties, there may be cases in which\n           some other arrangement will be equitable. Where litigation for the\n           common benefit arises among only some of the parties, or where the\n           interests of the parties in all items, lots, or parcels of property are not\n           identical, the court may segregate the costs of partition to the extent\n           practicable and apportion a part among particular parties only.\"\n           (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 17A West's Ann. Code Civ. Proc.\n           (1980 ed.) foll. § 874.040, p. 586.)\n\nSection 874.010 provides in pertinent part: \"The costs of partition include: [¶] (a)\n\n[r]easonable attorney's fees incurred or paid by a party for the common benefit.\"\n\n       \"[S]ection 874.040 broadly allows the trial court to 'make such other\n\napportionment as may be equitable.' \" (Lin v. Jeng (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 1008, 1024.)\n\n\"There is no ambiguity in the language of section 874.040. It simply states that the trial\n\ncourt must apportion the costs incurred in a partition action based upon either the parties'\n\ninterests in the property, or equitable considerations. The statute's broad language does\n\nnot limit the trial court's equitable discretion . . . .\" (Id. at p. 1025.)\n\n                                                 B\n\n       After the trial court issued its partition and owelty orders, Plaintiff filed a motion\n\nfor apportionment of attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action. Defendants\n\nfiled a motion for apportionment of costs only, arguing attorney fees were not incurred\n\nfor the common benefit of the parties as required for apportionment. Defendants\n\nrequested those costs be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Defendants opposed Plaintiff's motion for apportionment of\n\nattorney fees and costs, arguing they were not incurred for the common benefit of the\n\nparties.\n\n                                                 8\n\f       The trial court heard counsel's arguments on both motions. Plaintiff argued the\n\ncourt should apportion attorney fees and costs in proportion to the parties' interests in the\n\nProperty. Defendants, in turn, argued the parties should bear their own attorney fees\n\nbecause they were not incurred for the common benefit of the parties. The trial court\n\nstated it was unable to find any reported case involving a partial partition as involved in\n\nthis case. It noted: \"We have three co-tenants on one side who did not receive the same\n\nbenefit that [Plaintiff] received. They didn't get their interest[s] partitioned [primarily\n\nbecause the County would not allow a three-way partition of the remaining 119-acre\n\nparcel].\" Nevertheless, Defendants \"received a benefit [from the partition action] by\n\nridding themselves of the Plaintiff, but they didn't receive a full partition themselves.\"\n\nDiscussing Finney, the court stated that although Finney discussed two examples of\n\nequitable apportionment described in the California Law Revision Commission's\n\ncomment to section 874.040, Finney did not state those were the only instances in which\n\nequitable apportionment could be made under section 874.040. Plaintiff agreed. The\n\ntrial court concluded that in this case it had the power under section 874.040 to equitably\n\napportion attorney fees and costs. The court explained its reasoning for apportioning the\n\nattorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants, stating:\n\n           \"As best as I can read the cases, I feel on the one hand that [section]\n           874.040 allows the Court to divide fees and costs on an equitable\n           basis where there has not been [a] completely equal partition among\n           all the parties. And in this case, that has not happened. Plaintiff got\n           his share out. The Defendants were left with 119 acres that could\n           not be divided in kind because of the acreage requirements by the\n           County of Imperial, 40 acreage minimum requirement. And so that,\n           coupled with the fact that the litigation itself has always been\n           between the Defendants as a group which represents in effect one\n\n                                               9\n\f          united interest, and the Plaintiff is the other interest. That this\n          mandates upon the court an apportionment not as to the interests, but\n          as to what is equitable. And I feel what is equitable in this case is\n          what has been proposed by the Defendants; that the fees and the\n          costs should be borne equally. In other words, 50 percent [to\n          Plaintiff and] 50 percent [to Defendants] . . . .\"\n\n       The court's minute order granted Plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs,\n\nwhich \"shall be equitably apportioned between the parties with Plaintiff being responsible\n\nfor fifty percent thereof and the remaining three defendants being responsible for the\n\nremaining fifty percent.\" The court found that \"though all parties enjoyed a common\n\nbenefit in the pursuit of the partition action, that benefit was not equal between them.\n\nOnly Plaintiff received a complete partition of his interest. The remaining [D]efendants'\n\ninterests in the subject real property have not been individually partitioned.\" The court\n\nset a further hearing on Defendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees, if filed,\n\nand their motion for apportionment of costs. The court reserved the issue of whether\n\nDefendants could, at that stage, file a motion for apportionment of attorney fees.\n\n       Defendants subsequently filed a motion for apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, requesting they be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Plaintiff opposed their motion, arguing the motion was filed\n\nlate. At the beginning of the hearing on the motion, the trial court announced its tentative\n\nruling that it would confirm the prior trial judge's order equally apportioning attorney fees\n\nand costs (i.e., \"50-50\") between Plaintiff and Defendants.3 Following counsel's\n\n\n3      Imperial County Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly heard the motion after\nthe case was reassigned to him on the death of Imperial County Superior Court Judge\nBarrett J. Foerster, to whom the case was originally assigned. Although the record does\n                                            10\n\farguments, the trial court granted Defendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees\n\nand costs, apportioning them evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and Defendants (50\n\npercent). The court issued a written order apportioning attorney fees and costs incurred\n\nby the parties 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. The court then\n\nentered a final judgment partitioning the Property into two parcels as described above and\n\napportioning the parties' attorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to\n\nDefendants.\n\n                                              C\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning attorney\n\nfees and costs because there is substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that\n\nPlaintiff and Defendants did not benefit equally from the partition action and therefore\n\nthe attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action should be apportioned 50\n\npercent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants, rather than in proportion to their\n\nindividual interests (i.e., 25 percent to Plaintiffs and 75 percent to Defendants). As noted\n\nabove, the court partitioned the Property by dividing the Property into two parcels: (1) a\n\nsoutheast quarter consisting of 40 acres awarded to Plaintiff; and (2) the remaining 119\n\nacres awarded to Defendants. Because the remaining 119-acre parcel could not be\n\ndivided into three parcels under County's zoning ordinances, the court could not, and did\n\nnot, award each of the three Defendants a separate parcel in proportion to their respective\n\n\n\nnot appear to contain any document reflecting that event, the parties represent Judge\nFoerster passed away before the hearing on Defendants' motion for apportionment of\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n                                             11\n\finterests in the Property. Therefore, although Plaintiff received a separate 40-acre parcel\n\nin the partition action, the three Defendants did not receive a separate parcel, but instead\n\neach received a one-third cotenancy interest in the remaining 119-acre parcel. To\n\ncompensate for the difference in the per-acre value of the particular real property the\n\nparties received, the court awarded Defendants owelty of $7,250.4\n\n       Despite that owelty, the trial court found the parties did not benefit equally from\n\nthe partition, finding, in effect, the value of the real property held by Defendants in\n\ncotenancy that could not be divided into three parcels was less than the value of the real\n\nproperty held by Plaintiff separately. Based on our review of the whole record, we\n\nconclude there is substantial evidence to support that finding. The record shows County\n\nrejected the court's initial proposal for an equal four-way division of the Property because\n\nit consisted of only 159 acres and a minimum of 40 acres was required for farm land\n\nparcels under its zoning ordinances. Therefore, the court adopted an alternative partition,\n\nawarding Plaintiff his own 40-acre parcel and Defendants the remaining 119-acre parcel\n\nin cotenancy. The court could reasonably infer from County's zoning ordinances and the\n\n4       Contrary to Plaintiff's apparent assertion, the record does not show the trial court,\nin awarding owelty, sought to equalize the value of the parties' interests in real property\nafter the partition by, for example, awarding Defendants additional owelty for the\nreduced value of their postpartition cotenancy interests in a 119-acre parcel that could not\nbe divided into three parcels in the future. Instead, the record supports the conclusion\nthat the court's owelty calculation was based solely on the different intrinsic values of the\nfarm land in Plaintiff's 40-acre parcel (i.e., $5,200 per acre) and Defendants' 119-acre\nparcel (i.e., $5,000 per acre). (The parties appear to concede the parenthetical $5,500 per\nacre valuation in the court's final owelty order reflected either a typographical or\nmathematical error. The court's order found the value of Defendants' 119-acre parcel was\n$595,000, which equals $5,000 per acre.) The owelty award is not challenged in this\nappeal.\n\n                                             12\n\fnature of cotenancy that the value received by each of the three Defendants in the\n\npartition action was not equal to, and was in fact less than, that received by Plaintiff.\n\nFirst, the remaining 119-acre parcel could not be divided into three separate parcels in the\n\nfuture. Rather, it could be divided into only two parcels in the future, which presumably\n\ncould cause difficulty in apportioning that parcel in the future among the three\n\nDefendants. Second, any future partition action involving Defendants presumably would\n\nresult in significant attorney fees and costs, which Plaintiff would not suffer because he\n\nalready received a \"full partition\" of his interest in the Property. The court properly\n\nfound Plaintiff received, in effect, a \"full partition\" of his interest and Defendants\n\nreceived, in effect, only a \"partial partition\" of their interests. The trial court could\n\nreasonably find the parties' interests and benefits from the partition action were not\n\nidentical after the action. The trial court reasonably found that Plaintiff and Defendants\n\ndid not benefit equally from the instant partition action and therefore under section\n\n874.040 the attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action should be apportioned\n\nequitably and not in proportion to the parties' interests in the Property.\n\n       Furthermore, based on the whole record in this case, we cannot conclude the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by finding an equitable apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts was 50 percent to Plaintiff, who received a significantly greater benefit, and 50\n\npercent to Defendants, who received a significantly lesser benefit, from the partition\n\naction. The court could also reasonably infer that because there were, in effect, two sides\n\nrepresented in this partition action (i.e., Plaintiff on one side and Defendants on the\n\nother), it would be equitable for each side to bear one-half of the attorney fees and costs\n\n                                               13\n\fincurred in the action. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by equitably\n\napportioning one-half of the attorney fees and costs to Plaintiff and one-half to\n\nDefendants.5\n\n       Plaintiff does not cite any case showing the trial court abused its discretion by\n\napportioning the attorney fees and costs incurred in this case. Finney v. Gomez, cited by\n\nPlaintiff, is not factually or legally apposite to this case. In that case, the trial court\n\nordered a property owned equally by two cotenants to be partitioned by sale with the net\n\nproceeds (e.g., after reimbursement of the parties for expenses advanced beyond their\n\nproportionate interests) to be divided in proportion to their interests in the property (i.e.,\n\nequally). (Finney v. Gomez, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 531-533.) However, the court\n\nawarded the petitioning cotenant 100 percent of the attorney fees and costs incurred in the\n\npartition action. (Id. at p. 533.) On appeal, Finney concluded that because there was no\n\nsubstantial evidence to support an equitable apportionment of attorney fees and costs\n\nawarding the petitioning cotenant all of his attorney fees and costs, the trial court abused\n\n\n5      To the extent Plaintiff argues the trial court abused its discretion by not\nconsidering certain facts, he waives that argument by not specifically citing to the record\nor otherwise describing those purported overlooked facts and not presenting any\nsubstantive analysis showing the court abused its discretion by not considering those\nfacts. (Duarte v. Chino Community Hospital (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 849, 856; People v.\nHam (1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 768, 783, disapproved on another ground in People v.\nCompton (1971) 6 Cal.3d 55, 60, fn. 3; Jones v. Superior Court (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th\n92, 99; Landry v. Berryessa Union School Dist. (1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 691, 699-700.) In\nany event, because the trial court's judgment is presumed correct, we presume the court\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record in making its decision. (Denham v. Superior\nCourt (1970) 2 Cal.3d 557, 564.) Plaintiff has not carried his burden on appeal to rebut\nthat presumption and affirmatively show the trial court erred. (Ibid.; Fundamental\nInvestment etc. Realty Fund v. Gradow (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 966, 971.)\n\n                                               14\n\fits discretion. (Id. at pp. 548-550.) The court stated: \"Neither the evidence nor the\n\ncomplaint suggested Gomez had any more of an interest in the property and it certainly\n\ncontained no evidence suggesting he had a 100 percent interest in the property.\" (Id. at\n\np. 548.) Finney concluded: \"[T]here is no substantial basis for awarding fees and costs in\n\nthis case other than on the parties' proportion of interest in the property.\" (Id. at p. 550.)\n\nAccordingly, it reversed the judgment and remanded the case for the trial court to\n\napportion the attorney fees and costs equally between the parties. (Id. at p. 551.)\n\n       Because, as discussed above, Plaintiff and Defendants did not receive the same\n\nbenefit from the partition action, Finney v. Gomez is inapposite to this case and does not\n\npersuade us to reach a contrary conclusion. The trial court found Plaintiff received a \"full\n\npartition\" and Defendants received only a \"partial partition.\" Also, there were two sides\n\nto this action (i.e., Plaintiff versus Defendants). Given the substantial evidence to support\n\nthe trial court's apportionment of attorney fees and costs in this case, we conclude Finney\n\nis factually and legally inapposite. Plaintiff does not substantively address any other case\n\nshowing the trial court abused its discretion in this case.\n\n       Assuming arguendo, as Plaintiff apparently argues, there is a general preference\n\nunder section 874.040 for apportioning attorney fees and costs in proportion to the\n\nparties' interests in the property, he does not show the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nnot applying that general preference in the circumstances in this case. Because there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the court's equitable apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, the court was not bound to apply any such general preference. Section 874.040\n\nexpressly authorizes a trial court to apportion attorney fees and costs incurred in a\n\n                                              15\n\fpartition action as it considers equitable in its discretion. \"[Section 874.040] simply\n\nstates that the trial court must apportion the costs incurred in a partition action based\n\nupon either the parties' interests in the property, or equitable considerations. The statute's\n\nbroad language does not limit the trial court's equitable discretion . . . .\" (Lin v. Jeng,\n\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1025.) To the extent Plaintiff argues there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a different apportionment or that the trial court should have made\n\ndifferent inferences or findings based on the equitable considerations in this case, he\n\nmisconstrues and/or misapplies the substantial evidence and abuse of discretion standards\n\nof review that apply in this appeal.6\n\n                                        DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed. Defendants are entitled to their costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                              McDONALD, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nBENKE, Acting P.

Donnelly, Judges. Affirmed.\n\n\n\n         Plaintiff Gregory B.H. Cason (Plaintiff) appeals a judgment apportioning attorney\n\nfees and costs incurred in his partition action against defendants Theresa A.H. Cason,\n\nalso known as Theresa H. Schoneman, Donald S. Cason, David B.H. Cason and Diane\n\nCason, as trustees of the David Cason and Diane Cason 2000 Family Trust (together\n\nDefendants). On appeal, Plaintiff contends the trial court abused its discretion by\n\napportioning attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action for the common\n\fbenefit of the parties on an equitable basis of 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to\n\nDefendants.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       On October 30, 2003, Plaintiff filed a complaint requesting partition of certain real\n\nproperty owned by Plaintiff and Defendants in cotenancy, commonly known as \"Elder\n\nCanal, Gates 9 & 10\" and consisting of about 160 acres (Property). The complaint\n\nalleged Plaintiff and each of the three Defendants owned an undivided one-fourth interest\n\nin the Property. It sought partition by sale of the Property, alleging a sale would be more\n\nequitable than division in kind because the Property is farm land and too small to be\n\ndivided into parcels that can be economically farmed. Defendants answered the\n\ncomplaint, opposing partition by sale and, in the event the trial court ordered partition of\n\nthe Property, requesting that Plaintiff be allotted a parcel according to his one-fourth\n\ninterest and Defendants be allotted a parcel according to their collective three-fourths\n\ninterest.\n\n       On May 11, 2005, the trial court entered an interlocutory judgment directing\n\npartition of the Property according to the parties' interests and ordering that a referee be\n\nappointed to recommend division and partition the Property. The court further ordered\n\nthat \"if a division of the [Property] is impracticable or that a sale of the [Property], or any\n\nportion thereof, would be more equitable to the parties, the referee shall so state in the\n\nreport and set forth recommendations as to the sale of [the Property], or portion thereof,\n\nand the Court shall enter such further orders as the Court may deem proper and\n\nappropriate.\"\n\n                                               2\n\f       The appointed referee subsequently issued a report finding there were four\n\nplausible methods to partition the Property: (1) sell the Property and distribute the\n\nproceeds to the parties on a pro rata basis; (2) have those parties who do not want to sell\n\nthe Property purchase the interests of those parties who do want to sell it; (3) divide the\n\nProperty into one 120-acre parcel and one 40-acre parcel; and (4) divide the Property into\n\nfour 40-acre parcels. The referee recommended the fourth option as the best long-term\n\nsolution. After receiving the responses of the parties to the referee's report, the trial court\n\nordered the referee to conduct a further evaluation of the Property. In his second report,\n\nthe referee recommended that Plaintiff be awarded the southeast quarter of the Property\n\nbecause of drop box and harvesting issues.\n\n       On November 21, 2006, the trial court issued an order directing the Property to be\n\npartitioned in kind into four parcels of 40 acres each within one year and, if the partition\n\nwas not accomplished within one year, the Property was to be partitioned into one parcel\n\nconsisting of the southeast one-fourth and one parcel consisting of the remainder of the\n\nProperty. However, a subsequent survey apparently showed the Property consisted of\n\nonly about 159, and not 160, acres. Because zoning ordinances of Imperial County\n\n(County) require farm land parcels to be at least 40 acres, County apparently rejected the\n\nproposed division of the Property into four separate 40-acre parcels.\n\n       On April 3, 2008, based on counsel's representations that County rejected partition\n\nof the Property into four separate parcels, the trial court issued an order directing division\n\nof the Property into two parcels: (1) a southeast quarter consisting of 40 acres in\n\ncompliance with County's zoning ordinances; and (2) the remaining property (consisting\n\n                                               3\n\fof about 119 acres). The 40-acre parcel was awarded to Plaintiff and the other parcel was\n\nawarded to Defendants. The court reserved jurisdiction to consider a motion on the issue\n\nof whether owelty should be awarded.\n\n       The parties stipulated to the appointment of an appraiser, Matt Ramsey, to report\n\non the amount of owelty Plaintiff may owe Defendants. The appraiser determined\n\nPlaintiff's 40-acre parcel was worth $350,000 and Defendants' 119-acre parcel was worth\n\n$680,000. Plaintiff objected to the appraisal and requested that owelty be determined\n\nbased instead on an appraisal made by William S. Smith. Smith's appraisal valued\n\nPlaintiff's parcel at $5,200 per acre and Defendants' parcel at $5,000 per acre. Following\n\nan evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued an order finding Plaintiff owed Defendants\n\nowelty of $7,250, adopting the valuations in Smith's appraisal.\n\n       Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 874.010 and 874.040,1 Plaintiff filed\n\na motion for apportionment of attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action.\n\nDefendants filed a motion for apportionment of costs only and requested those costs be\n\napportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and Defendants (50 percent).\n\nDefendants opposed Plaintiff's motion for apportionment of attorney fees and costs\n\nbecause they were not incurred for the common benefit of the parties.\n\n       On September 2, 2010, the trial court heard counsel's arguments on both motions.\n\nThe court granted Plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs, which \"shall be equitably\n\napportioned between the parties with Plaintiff being responsible for fifty percent thereof\n\n\n1      All statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.\n\n                                             4\n\fand the remaining three defendants being responsible for the remaining fifty percent.\"\n\nThe Court found that \"though all parties enjoyed a common benefit in the pursuit of the\n\npartition action, that benefit was not equal between them. Only Plaintiff received a\n\ncomplete partition of his interest. The remaining [D]efendants' interests in the subject\n\nreal property have not been individually partitioned.\" The court set a further hearing on\n\nDefendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees, if filed, and their motion for\n\napportionment of costs.\n\n       Defendants subsequently filed a motion for apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, requesting they be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Plaintiff opposed their motion, arguing the motion was filed\n\nlate. On March 9, 2011, the court issued a written order apportioning attorney fees and\n\ncosts incurred by the parties in the partition action, to be apportioned 50 percent to\n\nPlaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. On May 9, 2011, the court entered a final\n\njudgment partitioning the Property into two parcels as described above and apportioning\n\nthe parties' attorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. 2\n\nPlaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n\n2      Because Plaintiff does not dispute the trial court's determination of the amounts of\nattorney fees and costs incurred for the common benefit of the parties, we need not, and\ndo not, set forth the specific amounts apportioned by the court.\n\n                                              5\n\f                                        DISCUSSION\n\n                                                I\n\n                                     Standard of Review\n\n       \"The standard of review on issues of attorney's fees and costs is abuse of\n\ndiscretion.

Defendants\n\nfiled a motion for apportionment of costs only, arguing attorney fees were not incurred\n\nfor the common benefit of the parties as required for apportionment. Defendants\n\nrequested those costs be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Defendants opposed Plaintiff's motion for apportionment of\n\nattorney fees and costs, arguing they were not incurred for the common benefit of the\n\nparties.\n\n                                                 8\n\f       The trial court heard counsel's arguments on both motions. Plaintiff argued the\n\ncourt should apportion attorney fees and costs in proportion to the parties' interests in the\n\nProperty. Defendants, in turn, argued the parties should bear their own attorney fees\n\nbecause they were not incurred for the common benefit of the parties. The trial court\n\nstated it was unable to find any reported case involving a partial partition as involved in\n\nthis case. It noted: \"We have three co-tenants on one side who did not receive the same\n\nbenefit that [Plaintiff] received. They didn't get their interest[s] partitioned [primarily\n\nbecause the County would not allow a three-way partition of the remaining 119-acre\n\nparcel].\" Nevertheless, Defendants \"received a benefit [from the partition action] by\n\nridding themselves of the Plaintiff, but they didn't receive a full partition themselves.\"\n\nDiscussing Finney, the court stated that although Finney discussed two examples of\n\nequitable apportionment described in the California Law Revision Commission's\n\ncomment to section 874.040, Finney did not state those were the only instances in which\n\nequitable apportionment could be made under section 874.040. Plaintiff agreed. The\n\ntrial court concluded that in this case it had the power under section 874.040 to equitably\n\napportion attorney fees and costs. The court explained its reasoning for apportioning the\n\nattorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants, stating:\n\n           \"As best as I can read the cases, I feel on the one hand that [section]\n           874.040 allows the Court to divide fees and costs on an equitable\n           basis where there has not been [a] completely equal partition among\n           all the parties. And in this case, that has not happened. Plaintiff got\n           his share out. The Defendants were left with 119 acres that could\n           not be divided in kind because of the acreage requirements by the\n           County of Imperial, 40 acreage minimum requirement. And so that,\n           coupled with the fact that the litigation itself has always been\n           between the Defendants as a group which represents in effect one\n\n                                               9\n\f          united interest, and the Plaintiff is the other interest. That this\n          mandates upon the court an apportionment not as to the interests, but\n          as to what is equitable. And I feel what is equitable in this case is\n          what has been proposed by the Defendants; that the fees and the\n          costs should be borne equally. In other words, 50 percent [to\n          Plaintiff and] 50 percent [to Defendants] . . . .\"\n\n       The court's minute order granted Plaintiff's request for attorney fees and costs,\n\nwhich \"shall be equitably apportioned between the parties with Plaintiff being responsible\n\nfor fifty percent thereof and the remaining three defendants being responsible for the\n\nremaining fifty percent.\" The court found that \"though all parties enjoyed a common\n\nbenefit in the pursuit of the partition action, that benefit was not equal between them.\n\nOnly Plaintiff received a complete partition of his interest. The remaining [D]efendants'\n\ninterests in the subject real property have not been individually partitioned.\" The court\n\nset a further hearing on Defendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees, if filed,\n\nand their motion for apportionment of costs. The court reserved the issue of whether\n\nDefendants could, at that stage, file a motion for apportionment of attorney fees.\n\n       Defendants subsequently filed a motion for apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, requesting they be apportioned evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and\n\nDefendants (50 percent). Plaintiff opposed their motion, arguing the motion was filed\n\nlate. At the beginning of the hearing on the motion, the trial court announced its tentative\n\nruling that it would confirm the prior trial judge's order equally apportioning attorney fees\n\nand costs (i.e., \"50-50\") between Plaintiff and Defendants.3 Following counsel's\n\n\n3      Imperial County Superior Court Judge Donal B. Donnelly heard the motion after\nthe case was reassigned to him on the death of Imperial County Superior Court Judge\nBarrett J. Foerster, to whom the case was originally assigned. Although the record does\n                                            10\n\farguments, the trial court granted Defendants' motion for apportionment of attorney fees\n\nand costs, apportioning them evenly between Plaintiff (50 percent) and Defendants (50\n\npercent). The court issued a written order apportioning attorney fees and costs incurred\n\nby the parties 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants. The court then\n\nentered a final judgment partitioning the Property into two parcels as described above and\n\napportioning the parties' attorney fees and costs 50 percent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to\n\nDefendants.\n\n                                              C\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in apportioning attorney\n\nfees and costs because there is substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that\n\nPlaintiff and Defendants did not benefit equally from the partition action and therefore\n\nthe attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action should be apportioned 50\n\npercent to Plaintiff and 50 percent to Defendants, rather than in proportion to their\n\nindividual interests (i.e., 25 percent to Plaintiffs and 75 percent to Defendants). As noted\n\nabove, the court partitioned the Property by dividing the Property into two parcels: (1) a\n\nsoutheast quarter consisting of 40 acres awarded to Plaintiff; and (2) the remaining 119\n\nacres awarded to Defendants. Because the remaining 119-acre parcel could not be\n\ndivided into three parcels under County's zoning ordinances, the court could not, and did\n\nnot, award each of the three Defendants a separate parcel in proportion to their respective\n\n\n\nnot appear to contain any document reflecting that event, the parties represent Judge\nFoerster passed away before the hearing on Defendants' motion for apportionment of\nattorney fees and costs.\n\n                                             11\n\finterests in the Property. Therefore, although Plaintiff received a separate 40-acre parcel\n\nin the partition action, the three Defendants did not receive a separate parcel, but instead\n\neach received a one-third cotenancy interest in the remaining 119-acre parcel. To\n\ncompensate for the difference in the per-acre value of the particular real property the\n\nparties received, the court awarded Defendants owelty of $7,250.4\n\n       Despite that owelty, the trial court found the parties did not benefit equally from\n\nthe partition, finding, in effect, the value of the real property held by Defendants in\n\ncotenancy that could not be divided into three parcels was less than the value of the real\n\nproperty held by Plaintiff separately. Based on our review of the whole record, we\n\nconclude there is substantial evidence to support that finding. The record shows County\n\nrejected the court's initial proposal for an equal four-way division of the Property because\n\nit consisted of only 159 acres and a minimum of 40 acres was required for farm land\n\nparcels under its zoning ordinances. Therefore, the court adopted an alternative partition,\n\nawarding Plaintiff his own 40-acre parcel and Defendants the remaining 119-acre parcel\n\nin cotenancy. The court could reasonably infer from County's zoning ordinances and the\n\n4       Contrary to Plaintiff's apparent assertion, the record does not show the trial court,\nin awarding owelty, sought to equalize the value of the parties' interests in real property\nafter the partition by, for example, awarding Defendants additional owelty for the\nreduced value of their postpartition cotenancy interests in a 119-acre parcel that could not\nbe divided into three parcels in the future. Instead, the record supports the conclusion\nthat the court's owelty calculation was based solely on the different intrinsic values of the\nfarm land in Plaintiff's 40-acre parcel (i.e., $5,200 per acre) and Defendants' 119-acre\nparcel (i.e., $5,000 per acre). (The parties appear to concede the parenthetical $5,500 per\nacre valuation in the court's final owelty order reflected either a typographical or\nmathematical error. The court's order found the value of Defendants' 119-acre parcel was\n$595,000, which equals $5,000 per acre.) The owelty award is not challenged in this\nappeal.\n\n                                             12\n\fnature of cotenancy that the value received by each of the three Defendants in the\n\npartition action was not equal to, and was in fact less than, that received by Plaintiff.\n\nFirst, the remaining 119-acre parcel could not be divided into three separate parcels in the\n\nfuture. Rather, it could be divided into only two parcels in the future, which presumably\n\ncould cause difficulty in apportioning that parcel in the future among the three\n\nDefendants. Second, any future partition action involving Defendants presumably would\n\nresult in significant attorney fees and costs, which Plaintiff would not suffer because he\n\nalready received a \"full partition\" of his interest in the Property. The court properly\n\nfound Plaintiff received, in effect, a \"full partition\" of his interest and Defendants\n\nreceived, in effect, only a \"partial partition\" of their interests. The trial court could\n\nreasonably find the parties' interests and benefits from the partition action were not\n\nidentical after the action. The trial court reasonably found that Plaintiff and Defendants\n\ndid not benefit equally from the instant partition action and therefore under section\n\n874.040 the attorney fees and costs incurred in the partition action should be apportioned\n\nequitably and not in proportion to the parties' interests in the Property.\n\n       Furthermore, based on the whole record in this case, we cannot conclude the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion by finding an equitable apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts was 50 percent to Plaintiff, who received a significantly greater benefit, and 50\n\npercent to Defendants, who received a significantly lesser benefit, from the partition\n\naction. The court could also reasonably infer that because there were, in effect, two sides\n\nrepresented in this partition action (i.e., Plaintiff on one side and Defendants on the\n\nother), it would be equitable for each side to bear one-half of the attorney fees and costs\n\n                                               13\n\fincurred in the action. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion by equitably\n\napportioning one-half of the attorney fees and costs to Plaintiff and one-half to\n\nDefendants.5\n\n       Plaintiff does not cite any case showing the trial court abused its discretion by\n\napportioning the attorney fees and costs incurred in this case. Finney v. Gomez, cited by\n\nPlaintiff, is not factually or legally apposite to this case. In that case, the trial court\n\nordered a property owned equally by two cotenants to be partitioned by sale with the net\n\nproceeds (e.g., after reimbursement of the parties for expenses advanced beyond their\n\nproportionate interests) to be divided in proportion to their interests in the property (i.e.,\n\nequally). (Finney v. Gomez, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 531-533.) However, the court\n\nawarded the petitioning cotenant 100 percent of the attorney fees and costs incurred in the\n\npartition action. (Id. at p. 533.) On appeal, Finney concluded that because there was no\n\nsubstantial evidence to support an equitable apportionment of attorney fees and costs\n\nawarding the petitioning cotenant all of his attorney fees and costs, the trial court abused\n\n\n5      To the extent Plaintiff argues the trial court abused its discretion by not\nconsidering certain facts, he waives that argument by not specifically citing to the record\nor otherwise describing those purported overlooked facts and not presenting any\nsubstantive analysis showing the court abused its discretion by not considering those\nfacts.

In\nany event, because the trial court's judgment is presumed correct, we presume the court\nconsidered all of the evidence in the record in making its decision. (Denham v.

The court stated: \"Neither the evidence nor the\n\ncomplaint suggested Gomez had any more of an interest in the property and it certainly\n\ncontained no evidence suggesting he had a 100 percent interest in the property.\" (Id. at\n\np. 548.) Finney concluded: \"[T]here is no substantial basis for awarding fees and costs in\n\nthis case other than on the parties' proportion of interest in the property.\" (Id. at p. 550.)\n\nAccordingly, it reversed the judgment and remanded the case for the trial court to\n\napportion the attorney fees and costs equally between the parties. (Id. at p. 551.)\n\n       Because, as discussed above, Plaintiff and Defendants did not receive the same\n\nbenefit from the partition action, Finney v. Gomez is inapposite to this case and does not\n\npersuade us to reach a contrary conclusion. The trial court found Plaintiff received a \"full\n\npartition\" and Defendants received only a \"partial partition.\" Also, there were two sides\n\nto this action (i.e., Plaintiff versus Defendants). Given the substantial evidence to support\n\nthe trial court's apportionment of attorney fees and costs in this case, we conclude Finney\n\nis factually and legally inapposite. Plaintiff does not substantively address any other case\n\nshowing the trial court abused its discretion in this case.\n\n       Assuming arguendo, as Plaintiff apparently argues, there is a general preference\n\nunder section 874.040 for apportioning attorney fees and costs in proportion to the\n\nparties' interests in the property, he does not show the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nnot applying that general preference in the circumstances in this case. Because there is\n\nsubstantial evidence to support the court's equitable apportionment of attorney fees and\n\ncosts, the court was not bound to apply any such general preference. Section 874.040\n\nexpressly authorizes a trial court to apportion attorney fees and costs incurred in a\n\n                                              15\n\fpartition action as it considers equitable in its discretion. \"[Section 874.040] simply\n\nstates that the trial court must apportion the costs incurred in a partition action based\n\nupon either the parties' interests in the property, or equitable considerations. The statute's\n\nbroad language does not limit the trial court's equitable discretion . . . .\" (Lin v. Jeng,\n\nsupra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 1025.) To the extent Plaintiff argues there is substantial\n\nevidence to support a different apportionment or that the trial court should have made\n\ndifferent inferences or findings based on the equitable considerations in this case, he\n\nmisconstrues and/or misapplies the substantial evidence and abuse of discretion standards\n\nof review that apply in this appeal.6\n\n                                        DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed. Defendants are entitled to their costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                              McDONALD, J.\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nBENKE, Acting P. J.\n\n\nO'ROURKE, J.\n\n\n\n\n6      To the extent Plaintiff argues the trial court erred by considering Defendants' late-\nfiled motion for apportionment of attorney fees, he waives that argument because he does\nnot present any substantive argument or analysis showing the court abused its discretion\nby considering that motion.
