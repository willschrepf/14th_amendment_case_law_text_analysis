The plaintiffs in this case are\r                                       \r\n\nformer residents of Boston's Old  West End who were forced to\r\n\nrelocate when their  homes were taken  by eminent domain  for\r\n\nurban  renewal.  They  claim that Massachusetts  law entitles\r\n\nthem  to first preference for tenancy  of all new residential\r\n\nunits built on the land, and that they are  being denied this\r\n\npreference in a new development called West End Place because\r\n\nmost  former  West  Enders are  white.    The  district judge\r\n\ndismissed the complaint, leading to this appeal.\r\n\n     The background facts  are undisputed.  In May  1956, the\r\n\nBoston  Housing  Authority,  the  forerunner  to  the current\r\n\nBoston  Redevelopment Authority (\"the BRA\"),1 prepared a plan\r\n\nfor  urban  renewal of  Boston's  Old  West End,  a  downtown\r\n\nneighborhood lying just  north of Beacon Hill.   The plan was\r\n\napproved  as required under  Massachusetts law, and  in 1958,\r\n\nthe BRA ordered  a taking by eminent domain of  a large area,\r\n\ndisplacing  over   three  thousand   households  of   diverse\r\n\nheritages, but including few African Americans.\r\n\n     The  BRA executed  a  lease  agreement  with  a  private\r\n\ndeveloper,  Charles River Park, Inc. (\"Charles River\").  Over\r\n\nthe next ten years, Charles  River razed buildings in the Old\r\n\nWest  End   and  built  offices,  condominiums,   and  luxury\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1The  BRA is  an entity  established  by the  Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts  to  undertake  urban renewal  projects  and to\r\nrelieve  housing  shortages.   See  Collins  v.  Selectmen of\r                                                                         \r\nBrookline, 325 Mass. 562, 564-66 (1950).\r                     \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nresidential   units.     The   new   buildings  were   either\r\n\nnonresidential or  so expensive that  very few of  the former\r\n\nWest Enders could afford to occupy them.\r\n\n     In 1970, the BRA terminated Charles River as the project\r\n\ndeveloper   and,  in   1986,  solicited  proposals   for  the\r\n\ndevelopment  of Lowell Square, located at the intersection of\r\n\nLomasney Way and  Staniford Street, the only  remaining large\r\n\nundeveloped  section of  the Old  West End.   A  proposal was\r\n\nsubmitted   by   the   Lowell   Square  Cooperative   Limited\r\n\nPartnership (the  \"developer\")  to build  a  new  development\r\n\ncalled West End Place at Lowell Square.2  \r\n\n     The   BRA   eventually   awarded   the   developer   the\r\n\nredevelopment  contract.   One restriction  in  the agreement\r\n\nbetween  the BRA  and  the developer  mirrors a  provision of\r\n\nMassachusetts law requiring the BRA to obligate the developer\r\n\nas follows:\r\n\n     (c)  to give preference in the selection of tenants\r\n     for dwelling  units built  in the  project area  to\r\n     families displaced  therefrom because  of clearance\r\n     and renewal  activity who  desire to  live in  such\r\n     dwelling units and who will be able to pay rents or\r\n     prices  equal  to  rents  or prices  charged  other\r\n     families for  similar or comparable  dwelling units\r\n     built as a part of the same redevelopment; and \r\n\n     (d) to  comply with  such other  conditions as  are\r\n     deemed  necessary to carry out the purposes of this\r\n     chapter, or requirements of  federal legislation or\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2The  partnership later  underwent  a  name  change  and,  in\r\naddition,  the  complaint  names other  private  entities and\r\nindividuals associated  with it.   For  convenience, all  are\r\nreferred to as \"the developer.\"\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     regulations   under   which    loans,   grants   or\r\n     contributions have been  made or agreed to  be made\r\n     to meet a part of the cost of the project.\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 121B,   49 (1986).\r\n\n     The  BRA also required  that the developer  work closely\r\n\nwith former West Enders in  developing the property.  To that\r\n\nend,  a number of former West  Enders formed the Old West End\r\n\nHousing Corporation.  This nonprofit entity and the developer\r\n\nsigned a  participation agreement, which stated,  inter alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nthat former West  Enders would have  first preference in  the\r\n\npurchase  or rental of  residential units in  West End Place,\r\n\nsubject to applicable local, state, and federal laws.\r\n\n     The  developer sought out numerous sources of financing,\r\n\nincluding government funding from  local, state, and  federal\r\n\nagencies.  In  particular, the federal Department  of Housing\r\n\nand Urban Development  (\"HUD\") funded a grant of $2.5 million\r\n\nfor  construction, and it  also committed $7  million in rent\r\n\nsubsidies for the low-income units in West End Place.  See 42\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   1437f (1994).  Like most federal housing assistance,\r\n\nthese funds were  contingent on compliance with  federal fair\r\n\nhousing requirements.  See 24 C.F.R.    1.5, 5.105 (1997).\r                                      \r\n\n     One  such requirement  is that  developer recipients  of\r\n\nfederal housing funds  must carry out an  affirmative program\r\n\nto attract  minority, as  well as  majority, applicants;  the\r\n\npertinent  regulation   contemplates  mailings   to  minority\r\n\norganizations,  assurances  of  nondiscrimination,  and  like\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nmeasures.    Each applicant  is  required  to  set forth  its\r\n\n\"affirmative fair housing  marketing plan\" on a  HUD form and\r\n\nsecure its approval by HUD.  See 24 C.F.R.    200.620 (1997).\r                                            \r\n\n     In addition,  HUD is  subject to  a 1991  consent decree\r\n\nbased  on a  finding that  HUD had  failed to  meet statutory\r\n\nobligations  to ensure that the minority population of Boston\r\n\nhad equal access to public housing.  NAACP, Boston Chapter v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nKemp, No.  78-850-S (D. Mass. Mar. 8, 1991) (consent decree).\r                \r\n\nThe   consent  decree  provides  that  all  Boston  area  HUD\r\n\naffirmative fair housing marketing plans \"shall have as their\r\n\ngoal  and measure  of  success the  achievement  of a  racial\r\n\ncomposition, in HUD-assisted housing located in neighborhoods\r\n\nwhich  are  predominantly  white, which  reflects  the racial\r\n\ncomposition of the City [of Boston] as a whole.\"  Id. at 2.3\r                                                                 \r\n\n     In  preparing  its  affirmative  fair housing  marketing\r\n\nplan,  the  developer  attempted  to reconcile  the  explicit\r\n\nstatutory  obligation of a  first preference for  former West\r\n\nEnders with HUD's consent-decree goal of a tenancy reflecting\r\n\nthe makeup of the City of Boston.  Minority races made  up 41\r\n\npercent  of  Boston's  population,  but  according  to  HUD's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3The consent decree ended lengthy litigation,  which included\r\nan  appeal  to  this  court,  over  HUD's  duties  to  foster\r\nintegrated housing.

The decree provided that its provisions\r\ndid  not \"constitute\"  and  should not  be  \"construed as\"  a\r\nquota.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nestimate, only  about 2  percent of the  former West  Enders.\r\n\nHUD  indicated that it  viewed an unqualified  preference for\r\n\nformer  West Enders  as  contrary  to  federal  fair  housing\r\n\nrequirements and the consent decree.  \r\n\n     The developer, the government agencies, and the Old West\r\n\nEnd Housing  Corporation submitted  the matter to  mediation.\r\n\nThe   mediator,  a   former   United   States  Attorney   for\r\n\nMassachusetts,  proposed that  former West  Enders receive  a\r\n\npreference as  to 55 percent of the  units in West End Place,\r\n\nand all other  applicants have equal access to  the remaining\r\n\n45 percent.   The developer and the agencies  agreed; the Old\r\n\nWest  End Housing  Corporation did  not.   Nevertheless,  the\r\n\nmediator's   solution  was   included   in  the   developer's\r\n\naffirmative fair  housing marketing plan, which  HUD approved\r\n\nin 1996.\r\n\n     The plan operates as follows.   West End Place  contains\r\n\n183  residential  units  that  fall  into   three  rent-based\r\n\ncategories: 58 \"low-income\" units (subsidized by HUD  funds),\r\n\n48  \"moderate-income units,\"  and 77  units  to be  rented at\r\n\nmarket  rates.   Under the  plan,  the developer  is to  give\r\n\nformer West Enders  first preference as to 101  of 183 units,\r\n\nthat  is,  55 percent  of  the total.   These  101  units are\r\n\nunevenly distributed over  the three rent categories:  former\r\n\nWest Enders have  a preference as to 19  low-income units (33\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\npercent),  24  moderate-income  units (50  percent),  and  58\r\n\nmarket-rate units (75 percent).\r\n\n     The tenant selection works by lottery.  Each preliminary\r\n\napplication  is assigned a  random number.   The applications\r\n\nare   then  separated  into   two  pools:  pool   A  contains\r\n\napplications from  displaced former  West Enders  and pool  B\r\n\ncontains  all other  applicants.   Then,  for the  low-income\r\n\nunits,  the top-ranked  applicant from  pool  A is  selected,\r\n\nfollowed by the two  top-ranked applicants from pool  B; this\r\n\nyields a  total of 33  percent pool A applicants  (33 percent\r\n\nformer West Enders) in the  low-income units.  The process is\r\n\nthen repeated until all 58 units are tentatively allocated.\r\n\n     The  same lottery  approach is  used for  the other  two\r\n\ncategories  of apartments.   For  moderate-income units,  the\r\n\ndraw ratio is one-to-one (50 percent former West Enders); for\r\n\nthe market-rate units,  three-to-one (75 percent former  West\r\n\nEnders).  Applicants who  have been selected in this  process\r\n\nare then invited to complete a full application and undergo a\r\n\nmore   thorough   screening   process,  which   can   include\r\n\nverifications of personal references and credit history.  The\r\n\nsame process can supply additional applicants if needed.\r\n\n     From  August 26  to September  26, 1996,  a real  estate\r\n\nmanager hired by the developer coordinated community outreach\r\n\nefforts  to stimulate preliminary  applications.  The manager\r\n\nalso contacted former West Enders as well as the Old West End\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nHousing Corporation.   The manager eventually  received 1,858\r\n\ntimely preliminary applications, 308 of  which identified the\r\n\napplicants as  former West  Enders.  Of  the 308  former West\r\n\nEnder applicants, 12  identified themselves as black,  one as\r\n\nLatino, and 19 did not identify their race.  \r\n\n     On September 26,  1996, the individual  plaintiffs--four\r\n\nformer West Enders--filed  a complaint in the  district court\r\n\nchallenging  the tenant  selection process  and  the plan  on\r\n\nnumerous  grounds;  they purported  to represent  former West\r\n\nEnders as a  class.  The Old West End Housing Corporation was\r\n\nalso named  as a plaintiff.   The numerous  defendants divide\r\n\ninto four categories:  the BRA and its director;  HUD and its\r\n\nSecretary; the City  of Boston and various  of its officials;\r\n\nand,  finally,  the  developer   and  other  private  parties\r\n\nassociated with the development of West End Place. \r\n\n     On October 21,  1996, the plaintiffs filed  an emergency\r\n\nmotion  for a  preliminary injunction  to  halt the  lottery,\r\n\nwhich was later withdrawn  when the defendants agreed  to let\r\n\nthe  former West Enders' representatives monitor the lottery.\r\n\nIn the lottery, which took place on October 29, 1996,  two of\r\n\nthe  named plaintiffs received  rankings in the  lottery that\r\n\nmake it  unlikely that  they will receive  units in  West End\r\n\nPlace.\r\n\n     The developer  and  various other  defendants  moved  to\r\n\ndismiss the  complaint,  Fed.

On  January 6,  1997,  the district  court issued  an\r\n\nopinion dismissing  many of the claims with  prejudice.  Raso\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Lago, 958 F. Supp. 686 (D. Mass. 1997).  After  the former\r                   \r\n\nWest  Enders  declined  to amend  their  complaint  to allege\r\n\ndiscriminatory  implementation  of the  plan--an  opportunity\r\n\noffered by  the district court--the district  court dismissed\r\n\nall  claims with  prejudice  and  entered  judgment  for  the\r\n\ndefendants on February 11, 1997.\r\n\n     The former West Enders appeal from the dismissal of only\r\n\ntwo of the  numerous claims they made in  the district court:\r\n\nfirst, a claim under 42 U.S.C.   1983 that the plan  violates\r\n\nequal protection  principles because it comprises a forbidden\r\n\nracial  classification, and second,  a claim that  section 49\r\n\ncreates  a trust  that subjects  the BRA  and developer  to a\r\n\ntrustee's  fiduciary duties  in  favor  of  the  former  West\r\n\nEnders.    There are  also  a  few  references to  the  Tenth\r\n\nAmendment  and to federal  statutes but these  references are\r\n\nnot seriously developed in plaintiffs' briefs.\r\n\n     We begin with section  1983, which pertinently  provides\r\n\nthat  no  person  may  deprive  any  person  of  his  or  her\r\n\nconstitutional rights under color of  state law.  42 U.S.C.  \r\n\n1983.    The  City of  Boston  and the  BRA  are  both \"state\r\n\nactors,\" see Monell  v. Department of  Soc. Servs., 436  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n658,  690  (1978), and  the  BRA  played  a central  role  in\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\ndeveloping and  fostering the plan challenged  by plaintiffs.\r\n\nHUD is a federal  entity not subject to section 1983, but its\r\n\nofficials  are  directly  constrained   by  equal  protection\r\n\nprinciples.4\r\n\n     In their complaint,  the former West Enders  allege that\r\n\nrace was  a motive  for curtailing  the statutory  preference\r\n\notherwise  available to  them.   Specifically, the  complaint\r\n\ncites the  defendants' reliance  upon the  consent decree  as\r\n\ncomprising a racial  purpose and goal and asserts  that, as a\r\n\nresult,  the former West Enders were deprived of a benefit--a\r\n\nstatutory preference for all of the apartments--based upon \"a\r\n\nracial classification.\"   In their appeal  brief, plaintiffs'\r\n\nshorthand  version  is  that  the  preference  was  curtailed\r\n\n\"because\" the former West Enders were predominantly white.\r\n\n     Factual assertions in a  complaint are normally accepted\r\n\nas  true for  purposes of  a  motion to  dismiss, see,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nBerner  v.

The reason  is  apparent:   the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4The Fifth Amendment's  Due Process Clause embodies  the core\r\nof the equal protection doctrine,  see Bolling v.

See 42 U.S.C.    3601-3619  (1994); 24 C.F.R.\r                               \r\n\n   200.600-200.640 (1997).   HUD may have  misunderstood both\r\n\nthe consent decree  and the federal  statute, but whether  it\r\n\ndid  or not, its  purpose to increase  minority opportunities\r                                     \r\n\nfor apartments in West End  Place by curtailing the statutory\r\n\npreference  is evident.   To  this end,  it appears  that HUD\r\n\nsimply declined to authorize funding unless and until some of\r\n\nthe apartments were  made available to applicants  other than\r\n\nformer West Enders.\r\n\n     This undenied racial motive distinguishes  the case from\r\n\nthose  others  involving  facially  neutral  actions--like  a\r\n\nzoning law  or employee qualification  test--where the  state\r\n\nactor denies  any  racial  purpose  or  concern.5    But  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  are mistaken  in treating  \"racial  motive\" as  a\r\n\nsynonym   for    a   constitutional    violation.

That  does not  make  such\r\n\nenactments  or actions  unlawful  or automatically  \"suspect\"\r\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause.\r\n\n     It is  quite true  that government  action taken out  of\r\n\nhostility to  a racial  group can be  condemned out  of hand,\r\n\ne.g., Yick  Wo v. Hopkins,  118 U.S. 356, 373-74  (1886), but\r                                     \r\n\nthere is no  allegation whatever  in the  complaint that  the\r\n\ndefendants were hostile to whites.  Nor would any such motive\r\n\nbe remotely  plausible.   Benign intentions  do not  immunize\r\n\ngovernment action, but they substantially narrow the inquiry.\r\n\nThe primary test is that any government action--regardless of\r\n\nbenign intent--is suspect  if it has been taken  on the basis\r\n\nof   a   \"racial   classification\";  in   such   cases,   the\r\n\nclassification  must  be  justified  by  a  compelling  state\r\n\ninterest and  narrow  tailoring.

Yet under the plan\r\n\nadopted in this case, the apartments freed from the statutory\r\n\npreference are made available to all applicants regardless of\r                                                \r\n\nrace.\r\n\n     West  End Place  was  built with  federal  help and  its\r\n\napartments   made   especially  desirable   through   federal\r\n\nsubsidies.  It might not seem remarkable  that the government\r\n\nshould insist, as a condition of this investment, that a fair\r\n\nnumber  of the  apartments  should  be  effectively  open  to\r\n\napplication by tenants of all races.   Nor have we been  able\r\n\nto find  any case where  the government has been  required to\r\n\nshow  a compelling interest, or narrow tailoring of remedies,\r\n\nfor a  condition framed  so as to  secure equal  treatment of\r                                                           \r\n\napplicants regardless of race.  \r\n\n     Language in a few Supreme Court decisions could be taken\r\n\nto  mean that  any  action  in which  race  plays  a role  is\r                              \r\n\nconstitutionally suspect.  However, the governmental  actions\r\n\nin  those   cases  were  fundamentally   different  and  more\r\n\nprovocative.  In Adarand, the statute gave special incentives\r                                    \r\n\nto government  contractors to hire  minority subcontractors.6\r\n\nThe  redistricting  cases  concern   state  voting  districts\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6See Adarand, 515 U.S.  at 205-06; see also Croson,  488 U.S.\r                                                              \r\nat 493-94; Wygant v.

Here,\r                                   \r\n\nthe government's condition  on federal funds was that some of\r\n\nthe   apartments--which    otherwise   would    have   almost\r\n\nautomatically been  occupied by whites--be made  available to\r\n\nall applicants on a race-blind basis.  We cannot view this as\r\n\na \"racial classification[]\" reserving benefits for  a favored\r\n\nrace, Adarand, 515 U.S. at 235, or as \"an effort to segregate\r                         \r\n\nthe races,\" Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642-43.\r                            \r\n\n     Several  other equal  protection arguments  made  by the\r\n\nformer West Enders need no lengthy discussion, either because\r\n\nthey have  been essentially  abandoned on  appeal or  because\r\n\nthey  are clearly unpersuasive.  The former category includes\r\n\nthe former West Enders'  attack on HUD requirements that  the\r\n\napartments be publicized in minority communities;8 the latter\r\n\nincludes  the attempt to charge HUD with treating the consent\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7See Bush  v.

The defendants are no less guilty\r\nof muddling the issue in their pretense that outreach efforts\r\nare all that are involved in this case.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\ndecree's numerical  \"goal\" as  if it were  a quota--a  notion\r\n\nbelied  by the substantial preference retained for the former\r\n\nWest Enders.\r\n\n     The  story, however, is not quite over.  It is one thing\r\n\nfor  HUD to  insist  that the  apartments it  subsidizes must\r\n\neffectively be open  to all races; it would  be quite another\r\n\nif HUD  planned  to impose  this requirement  only where  the\r\n\nbeneficiaries  of the statutory preference were white.  That,\r\n\nwe  think,  would be  government  action based  on  a \"racial\r\n\nclassification\" and  would need  to be  narrowly tailored  to\r\n\nserve a compelling government interest.\r\n\n     The difficulty  is that we  are dealing here with  an ad\r                                                                         \r\n\nhoc  administrative action.    Accepting  the  truth  of  the\r               \r\n\ncomplaint's factual allegations, HUD's actions were  prompted\r\n\nnot by any  general, racially skewed policy  toward statutory\r\n\npreferences but by the peculiar interplay of Boston's consent\r\n\ndecree, the Massachusetts statute, and the  respective racial\r\n\nmakeups of the Boston population and  the former West Enders.\r\n\nWhat HUD  would  do  in  some  other,  hypothetical  case  is\r\n\nunknown, but  it is  certainly not  precluded, either  by the\r\n\nconsent decree  or anything else, from  challenging statutory\r\n\npreferences that exclude whites.

Forthe reasons already given,we do not.\r\n\n     We turn now to plaintiffs' second and  distinct claim on\r\n\nappeal that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 121B,   49,  \"has the effect\r\n\nof creating  a trust for  the benefit of people  displaced by\r\n\nurban renewal.\"   The district court ruled that  there was no\r\n\ndemonstrated  legislative intent to  create a trust  and that\r\n\nthe  trust argument  failed  for  a  further  more  technical\r\n\nreason.   See 958 F. Supp. at 700  (citing New Eng. Trust Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 348 (1958)).  On appeal, plaintiffs\r                     \r\n\ndevote five pages of their brief to discussing the requisites\r\n\nfor trust creation under Massachusetts law.\r\n\n     Whether or not Massachusetts law created a trust for the\r\n\nformer West Enders appears to us to  be beside the point.  If\r\n\nwe assume arguendo  that the former West Enders  are entitled\r                              \r\n\nto,  and can  enforce, whatever  priority  is provided  under\r\n\nsection  49, subject always  to superseding federal  law, the\r\n\ntrust concept  is nothing  more than  a possible  alternative\r\n\nremedy for enforcing  any unpreempted rights that  section 49\r\n\nmay provide.   The question to  be answered, before  remedies\r\n\nare even pertinent, is the extent of those rights.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\n     By  its terms  section  49(c)  creates  a  priority  for\r\n\ndisplaced  former  residents,  and  subsection  (d)  arguably\r\n\nqualifies this priority  by also obligating the  developer to\r\n\ncomply   with  \"requirements   of   federal  legislation   or\r\n\nregulations  under which loans, grants, or contributions have\r\n\nbeen made or agreed to be made to meet a part of  the cost of\r\n\nthe project.\"   Mass.  Gen.  Laws ch.  121B,    49(d).    The\r\n\ndefendants'  position, adopted by the district court, is that\r\n\nsuch federal requirements--as a matter of Massachusetts law--\r\n\nqualify   the  statutory  priority.     Plaintiffs  have  not\r\n\nchallenged this ruling on appeal.\r\n\n     The plaintiffs  might have  argued  that the  limitation\r\n\nadopted  here is  not  itself  a  \"requirement\"  of  \"federal\r\n\nlegislation  or  regulations\"  but   is  merely  a  developer\r\n\nproposal that HUD  has chosen to bless.  Possibly, plaintiffs\r\n\nthought that this arguable distinction did not matter because\r\n\na  federal administrative  measure, even  if  not statute  or\r\n\nregulation,  might  override  state   legislation  under  the\r\n\nSupremacy Clause--assuming always  that it was  an authorized\r\n\nmeasure.  This  is by no  means clear, but arguments  on this\r\n\npoint have not been made and need not be pursued. \r\n\n     In the district court, it appears that plaintiffs' trust\r\n\nargument may have been advanced  primarily as an adjunct to a\r\n\ndifferent  constitutional claim, namely a claim that the plan\r\n\nin  question impaired a property interest without due process\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\nor  just compensation.   The alleged trust,  in this context,\r\n\nwould be a way of expressing a claimed property interest.  It\r\n\nis not obvious why a trust interest would be more entitled to\r\n\nthis status than section 49's simple expression of a priority\r\n\nin favor of former tenants.\r\n\n     In all events, whether called a trust or something else,\r\n\nany  property interest created  by section 49(c)  is arguably\r\n\nsubject to section  49's own explicit reservation  in section\r\n\n49(d).  As already noted,  the plaintiffs on this appeal have\r\n\nnot  challenged the district court ruling that subsection (d)\r\n\nqualifies subsection (c) and also embraces the disputed plan.\r\n\nTaking  these  district court  rulings  as unchallenged,  the\r\n\ntrust  argument adds  nothing to  the  due process  argument,\r\n\nwhich  itself has not itself been  renewed in the plaintiffs'\r\n\nbriefs in this court.\r\n\n     This  is a case  that stirs conflicting  sympathies, for\r\n\nthose  ousted  from  their West  End  neighborhood  by \"urban\r\n\nrenewal\" many years ago  no less than for  minorities wrongly\r\n\ndenied fair  housing opportunities  in Boston.   But we  have\r\n\nproperly  sought to  decide this  appeal  based upon  Supreme\r\n\nCourt precedent, as best we can discern it, recognizing  that\r\n\nthe  case  is a  difficult  and unusual  one on  the  edge of\r\n\ndeveloping law.               Affirmed.\r                                                  \r\n\n                                        Dissent follows.\r                                                                   \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n          Stahl, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.  There is\r                      Stahl, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.  \r                                          \r\n\nfor  me considerable appeal  in the majority's  resolution of\r\n\nplaintiffs'  equal  protection  claims.     The  governmental\r\n\nconduct these claims challenge involves a patently good faith\r\n\nand facially reasonable  effort to accommodate  the competing\r\n\ninterests  of two historic  losers in Boston's  housing wars:\r\n\nthe  racial  and  ethnic minorities  entitled  to  invoke the\r\n\nprotections  of  the  consent decree  in  NAACP  v.  Kemp and\r                                                                     \r\n\nfederal fair housing  laws, and  the former  West Enders,  an\r\n\nethnically  diverse, lower middle  class group which,  in the\r\n\nname of \"urban renewal,\" was forced from its neighborhood and\r\n\ncould not afford to return. \r\n\n          Nonetheless,  I cannot  join  the  portion  of  the\r\n\nmajority opinion that affirms the district court's pleadings-\r\n\nbased  dismissal of  the equal  protection claims.    While I\r\n\nagree with the  majority that  reverse discrimination  claims\r\n\nlike the  present one  are \"on the  edge of  developing law,\"\r\n\nante at 19, I do  think it settled that, when  the government\r                \r\n\nwithdraws  benefits from a  class of citizens  because of the\r\n\nrace  or ethnicity  of the  class, courts  are to  scrutinize\r\n\nstrictly  the government's  conduct so as  to ensure  that it\r\n\nfurthers a  compelling governmental interest and  is narrowly\r\n\ntailored to advance that interest.  See Adarand Constructors,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc. v. Pena, 515  U.S. 200, 226-227 (1995).  For the reasons\r                        \r\n\nthat follow,  I believe plaintiffs'  complaint fairly alleges\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\nsuch a withdrawal of benefits.  And I do not  see how we can,\r\n\nat  this  stage  of  the litigation,  conclude  that  such  a\r\n\nwithdrawal of benefits passes strict scrutiny.      \r\n\n          The   complaint  alleges   that  the   governmental\r\n\ndefendants  curtailed  plaintiffs'  statutory  preference  in\r\n\norder to  comply with  the consent decree  in NAACP  v. Kemp.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSee ante at 11.   Because the purpose of that  consent decree\r                    \r\n\nis  \"the achievement of a racial composition, in HUD-assisted\r\n\nhousing  located  in  neighborhoods  which are  predominantly\r\n\nwhite, which reflects  the racial composition of the  City of\r\n\nBoston as a  whole,\" id. at 6,  a reasonable inference to  be\r                                    \r\n\ndrawn from plaintiffs' complaint, see Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes,\r                                                                        \r\n\n118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997) (reasonable inferences are to\r\n\nbe drawn  in favor of  the party opposing  a Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n12(b)(6)  motion), is  that  defendants  acted  as  they  did\r\n\nbecause the putative plaintiff class was predominantly white.\r\n\nThe  fact that defendants  \"do not dispute\"  this accusation,\r\n\nante  at 11,  only  underscores  our  obligation  to  subject\r                \r\n\ndefendants' conduct to strict scrutiny, see Adarand, 515 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 224  (\"[A]ny person,  of whatever race,  has the  right to\r\n\ndemand   that  any   governmental   actor   subject  to   the\r\n\nConstitution  justify  any racial  classification  subjecting\r\n\nthat person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial\r\n\nscrutiny.\").\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\n          The  majority reaches  a contrary  conclusion--that\r\n\nstrict  scrutiny does not apply--because it regards the facts\r\n\nplaintiffs  have pleaded in support of their equal protection\r\n\nclaims  insufficient to  describe a  \"racial classification.\"\r\n\nSee  ante at  13-16 (holding  that this  case is  outside the\r                     \r\n\nprinciple  of  Adarand).   In  reaching  its  conclusion, the\r                                  \r\n\nmajority emphasizes  the effect of curtailing  the preference\r                                           \r\n\non  non-parties to  this litigation,  see ante at  13 (\"[T]he\r                                                          \r\n\napartments  freed  from  the  statutory preference  are  made\r\n\navailable  to all applicants  regardless of race.\"),  and the\r                             \r\n\ndefendants' intent in enacting the curtailment, see id. at 14\r                                                                   \r\n\n(\"It might  not seem  remarkable that  the government  should\r\n\ninsist .  . . that a fair number  of the apartments should be\r\n\neffectively open to  application by tenants of  all races.\").\r\n\nThe majority  also reads  the complaint  to allege only  that\r\n\ndefendants  acted as they did because plaintiffs are racially\r\n\nidentifiable; it does not  read the complaint to allege  that\r\n\ndefendants  acted as they  did because plaintiffs  are white.\r\n\nId. at 15.   \r               \r\n\n          Taking  this last  point first,  I  simply disagree\r\n\nwith the majority's reading of the complaint.  The  complaint\r\n\ndoes not  allege that  the preference  was curtailed  because\r\n\nplaintiffs  are  racially  monolithic;  it alleges  that  the\r\n\npreference was curtailed because of the consent decree.  And,\r\n\nas I have stated, because the consent decree operates only in\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r\n\nfavor of racial  and ethnic minorities, it could  not be read\r\n\nto require curtailment  of the preference if  the former West\r\n\nEnders  were  predominantly  black.   Thus,  for  purposes of\r\n\nevaluating  defendants' Rule  12(b)(6)  motion, I  believe we\r\n\nmust  read into  the complaint  the  allegation the  majority\r\n\nbelieves  necessary to trigger  strict scrutiny, see  ante at\r                                                                      \r\n\n16:  that defendants would not have acted as they did had the\r\n\nplaintiff class  been predominantly of color.  See Aybar, 118\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d at 13;  see also Conley  v.

P.  8(a)(2) does not require a complaint\r\n\nto  set  forth  specific  facts   in  support  of  a  general\r\n\nallegation of discrimination).\r\n\n          Even  if the  majority has  properly  construed the\r\n\ncomplaint, I believe plaintiffs'  equal protection claims are\r\n\nsufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and to trigger\r\n\nstrict scrutiny.   In  the redistricting  cases, the  Supreme\r\n\nCourt   has   emphasized   that   government   action   which\r\n\nsubordinates  race  neutral considerations  to  an overriding\r\n\nracial purpose is  constitutionally suspect:   \"We recognized\r\n\nin  Shaw[v. Reno,  509  U.S. 630  (1993)]  that, outside  the\r                            \r\n\ndistricting context, statutes are  subject to strict scrutiny\r\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause  not just when they contain\r\n\nexpress racial classifications,  but also  when, though  race\r\n\nneutral on their face, they are motivated by a racial purpose\r\n\nor  object.\"   Miller v.  Johnson, 515  U.S. 900,  913 (1995)\r                                             \r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\n(affirming   the   invalidation,   under   equal   protection\r\n\nprinciples,  of a  Georgia  congressional redistricting  plan\r\n\ndesigned to increase  the number of majority  black districts\r\n\nin  Georgia)  (citation omitted).    It  remains to  be  seen\r\n\nwhether  the Court  will  press this  principle to  its outer\r\n\nlimit  and  strictly  scrutinize  even  governmental  conduct\r\n\nwhich, though  predominantly motivated  by a  racial purpose,\r\n\nwould not appear  to burden any person because of  his or her\r\n\nrace--e.g., a public university's efforts at recruiting fully\r                      \r\n\nqualified applicants of  color for its first year  law school\r\n\nclass.    But it  seems  apparent  that defendants'  lack  of\r\n\nhostility towards whites in particular, cf. ante at 13,  does\r                                                            \r\n\nnot  shield  their  conduct--which  has  burdened  plaintiffs\r\n\nbecause they are, as a group, racially identifiable--from the\r\n\nmost searching  judicial inquiry.   See  Miller, 515 U.S.  at\r                                                           \r\n\n913.                          This leads to a final point.  I\r\n\nthink the majority runs afoul of Adarand in concentrating its\r                                                    \r\n\nfocus so heavily on both defendants' intent and the effect of\r\n\ndefendants' actions on non-parties to this case.  The Supreme\r\n\nCourt has squarely rejected the argument that classifications\r\n\nmotivated   by   \"benign\"   considerations   should  not   be\r\n\nscrutinized strictly.   See  Adarand, 515 U.S.  at 226.   And\r                                                \r\n\nthough this  case does appear  unique in that  the government\r\n\nconduct at  issue is more  a withdrawal of a  special benefit\r\n\nfrom whites than  a giving of special benefits  to members of\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                         -24-\r\r\n\nminority groups,9 the  clear import of Adarand is  that it is\r                                                          \r\n\nthe  plaintiff's \"personal right  to equal protection  of the\r                                      \r\n\nlaws,\" 515 U.S. at 227,  and not some non-party's interest in\r\n\ncompeting for that which would be the plaintiff's but for his\r\n\nor her race, that is constitutionally safeguarded.   Thus, in\r\n\nevaluating the constitutionality  of defendants' conduct,  we\r\n\nmust not  look to its  effect and motivation with  respect to\r\n\nothers;  we  must  look at  its  effect  and  motivation with\r\n\nrespect  to plaintiffs.  And here, quite clearly, defendants'\r\n\nconduct has  had  the effect  of  depriving plaintiffs  of  a\r\n\nbenefit  and was  prompted by  the fact  that plaintiffs  are\r\n\nmostly white.   \r\n\n          Because  defendants'   conduct  should   have  been\r\n\nstrictly  scrutinized, their  motion  to dismiss  plaintiffs'\r\n\nequal  protection  claim  should have  been  denied  and they\r\n\nshould  have been  required to  produce  evidence that  their\r\n\nconduct  was  narrowly  tailored  to  advance   a  compelling\r\n\ngovernmental   interest.

They claim that Massachusetts law entitles them to first preference for tenancy of all new residential units built on the land, and that they are being denied this preference in a new development called West End Place because most former West Enders are white.  The district judge dismissed the complaint, leading to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are undisputed.  In May 1956, the Boston Housing Authority, the forerunner to the current Boston Redevelopment Authority (\"the BRA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> prepared a plan for urban renewal of Boston's Old West End, a downtown neighborhood lying just north of Beacon Hill.  The plan was approved as required under Massachusetts law, and in 1958, the BRA ordered a taking by eminent domain of a large area, displacing over three thousand households of diverse heritages, but including few African Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRA executed a lease agreement with a private developer, Charles River Park, Inc.  (\"Charles River\").  Over the next ten years, Charles River razed buildings in the Old West End and built offices, condominiums, and luxury residential units.  The new buildings were either nonresidential or so expensive that very few of the former West Enders could afford to occupy them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the BRA terminated Charles River as the project developer and, in 1986, solicited proposals for the development of Lowell Square, located at the intersection of Lomasney Way and Staniford Street, the only remaining large undeveloped section of the Old West End.  A proposal was submitted by the Lowell Square Cooperative Limited Partnership (the \"developer\") to build a new development called West End Place at Lowell Square.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRA eventually awarded the developer the redevelopment contract.  One restriction in the agreement between the BRA and the developer mirrors a provision of Massachusetts law requiring the BRA to obligate the developer as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>(c) to give preference in the selection of tenants for dwelling units built in the project area to families displaced therefrom because of clearance and renewal activity who desire to live in such dwelling units and who will be able to pay rents or prices equal to rents or prices charged other families for similar or comparable dwelling units built as a part of the same redevelopment;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(d) to comply with such other conditions as are deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or requirements of federal legislation or regulations under which loans, grants or contributions have been made or agreed to be made to meet a part of the cost of the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 121B, &#167; 49 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRA also required that the developer work closely with former West Enders in developing the property.  To that end, a number of former West Enders formed the Old West End Housing Corporation.  This nonprofit entity and the developer signed a participation agreement, which stated, inter alia, that former West Enders would have first preference in the purchase or rental of residential units in West End Place, subject to applicable local, state, and federal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer sought out numerous sources of financing, including government funding from local, state, and federal agencies.  In particular, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funded a grant of $2.5 million for construction, and it also committed $7 million in rent subsidies for the low-income units in West End Place.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f (1994).  Like most federal housing assistance, these funds were contingent on compliance with federal fair housing requirements.  See 24 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1.5, 5.105 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such requirement is that developer recipients of federal housing funds must carry out an affirmative program to attract minority, as well as majority, applicants;  the pertinent regulation contemplates mailings to minority organizations, assurances of nondiscrimination, and like measures.  Each applicant is required to set forth its \"affirmative fair housing marketing plan\" on a HUD form and secure its approval by HUD.  See 24 C.F.R. &#167; 200.620 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, HUD is subject to a 1991 consent decree based on a finding that HUD had failed to meet statutory obligations to ensure that the minority population of Boston had equal access to public housing.  NAACP, Boston Chapter v. Kemp, No. 78-850-S (D.Mass. Mar. 8, 1991) (consent decree).  The consent decree provides that all Boston area HUD affirmative fair housing marketing plans \"shall have as their goal and measure of success the achievement of a racial composition, in HUD-assisted housing located in neighborhoods which are predominantly white, which reflects the racial composition of the City [of Boston] as a whole.\"  Id. at 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparing its affirmative fair housing marketing plan, the developer attempted to reconcile the explicit statutory obligation of a first preference for former West Enders with HUD's consent-decree goal of a tenancy reflecting the makeup of the City of Boston.  Minority races made up 41 percent of Boston's population, but according to HUD's estimate, only about 2 percent of the former West Enders.  HUD indicated that it viewed an unqualified preference for former West Enders as contrary to federal fair housing requirements and the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer, the government agencies, and the Old West End Housing Corporation submitted the matter to mediation.  The mediator, a former United States Attorney for Massachusetts, proposed that former West Enders receive a preference as to 55 percent of the units in West End Place, and all other applicants have equal access to the remaining 45 percent.  The developer and the agencies agreed;  the Old West End Housing Corporation did not.  Nevertheless, the mediator's solution was included in the developer's affirmative fair housing marketing plan, which HUD approved in 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan operates as follows.  West End Place contains 183 residential units that fall into three rent-based categories:  58 \"low-income\" units (subsidized by HUD funds), 48 \"moderate-income units,\" and 77 units to be rented at market rates.  Under the plan, the developer is to give former West Enders first preference as to 101 of 183 units, that is, 55 percent of the total.  These 101 units are unevenly distributed over the three rent categories:  former West Enders have a preference as to 19 low-income units (33 percent), 24 moderate-income units (50 percent), and 58 market-rate units (75 percent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tenant selection works by lottery.  Each preliminary application is assigned a random number.  The applications are then separated into two pools:  pool A contains applications from displaced former West Enders and pool B contains all other applicants.  Then, for the low-income units, the top-ranked applicant from pool A is selected, followed by the two top-ranked applicants from pool B;  this yields a total of 33 percent pool A applicants (33 percent former West Enders) in the low-income units.  The process is then repeated until all 58 units are tentatively allocated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same lottery approach is used for the other two categories of apartments.  For moderate-income units, the draw ratio is one-to-one (50 percent former West Enders);  for the market-rate units, three-to-one (75 percent former West Enders).  Applicants who have been selected in this process are then invited to complete a full application and undergo a more thorough screening process, which can include verifications of personal references and credit history.  The same process can supply additional applicants if needed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From August 26 to September 26, 1996, a real estate manager hired by the developer coordinated community outreach efforts to stimulate preliminary applications.  The manager also contacted former West Enders as well as the Old West End Housing Corporation.  The manager eventually received 1,858 timely preliminary applications, 308 of which identified the applicants as former West Enders.  Of the 308 former West Ender applicants, 12 identified themselves as black, one as Latino, and 19 did not identify their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 1996, the individual plaintiffs--four former West Enders--filed a complaint in the district court challenging the tenant selection process and the plan on numerous grounds;  they purported to represent former West Enders as a class.  The Old West End Housing Corporation was also named as a plaintiff.  The numerous defendants divide into four categories:  the BRA and its director;  HUD and its Secretary;  the City of Boston and various of its officials;  and, finally, the developer and other private parties associated with the development of West End Place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the lottery, which was later withdrawn when the defendants agreed to let the former West Enders' representatives monitor the lottery.  In the lottery, which took place on October 29, 1996, two of the named plaintiffs received rankings in the lottery that make it unlikely that they will receive units in West End Place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer and various other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and the district court heard argument on the motion on November 20, 1996.  On January 6, 1997, the district court issued an opinion dismissing many of the claims with prejudice.  Raso v. Lago, 958 F.Supp. 686 (D.Mass.1997).  After the former West Enders declined to amend their complaint to allege discriminatory implementation of the plan--an opportunity offered by the district court--the district court dismissed all claims with prejudice and entered judgment for the defendants on February 11, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The former West Enders appeal from the dismissal of only two of the numerous claims they made in the district court:  first, a claim under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 that the plan violates equal protection principles because it comprises a forbidden racial classification, and second, a claim that section 49 creates a trust that subjects the BRA and developer to a trustee's fiduciary duties in favor of the former West Enders.  There are also a few references to the Tenth Amendment and to federal statutes but these references are not seriously developed in plaintiffs' briefs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with section 1983, which pertinently provides that no person may deprive any person of his or her constitutional rights under color of state law.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  The City of Boston and the BRA are both \"state actors,\" see Monell v. Department of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and the BRA played a central role in developing and fostering the plan challenged by plaintiffs.  HUD is a federal entity not subject to section 1983, but its officials are directly constrained by equal protection principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their complaint, the former West Enders allege that race was a motive for curtailing the statutory preference otherwise available to them.  Specifically, the complaint cites the defendants' reliance upon the consent decree as comprising a racial purpose and goal and asserts that, as a result, the former West Enders were deprived of a benefit--a statutory preference for all of the apartments--based upon \"a racial classification.\"   In their appeal brief, plaintiffs' shorthand version is that the preference was curtailed \"because\" the former West Enders were predominantly white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factual assertions in a complaint are normally accepted as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss, see, e.g., Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1997);  in addition, the defendants do not dispute that racial concerns and the consent decree prompted their effort to cut back upon the statutory preference.  The reason is apparent:  the former West Enders are almost entirely white, and without some limitation on the preference rights of former West Enders, HUD would have been funding subsidized apartments from which minorities were effectively excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD apparently thought that this outcome would violate the consent decree and its statutory obligation to promote fair housing.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3601-3619 (1994);  24 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 200.600-200.640 (1997).  HUD may have misunderstood both the consent decree and the federal statute, but whether it did or not, its purpose to increase minority opportunities for apartments in West End Place by curtailing the statutory preference is evident.  To this end, it appears that HUD simply declined to authorize funding unless and until some of the apartments were made available to applicants other than former West Enders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This undenied racial motive distinguishes the case from those others involving facially neutral actions--like a zoning law or employee qualification test--where the state actor denies any racial purpose or concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  But the plaintiffs are mistaken in treating \"racial motive\" as a synonym for a constitutional violation.  Every antidiscrimination statute aimed at racial discrimination, and every enforcement measure taken under such a statute, reflect a concern with race.  That does not make such enactments or actions unlawful or automatically \"suspect\" under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that government action taken out of hostility to a racial group can be condemned out of hand, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 373-74, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 1072-73, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), but there is no allegation whatever in the complaint that the defendants were hostile to whites.  Nor would any such motive be remotely plausible.  Benign intentions do not immunize government action, but they substantially narrow the inquiry.  The primary test is that any government action--regardless of benign intent--is suspect if it has been taken on the basis of a \"racial classification\";  in such cases, the classification must be justified by a compelling state interest and narrow tailoring.  See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 235, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2116-17, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the use of the \"racial classification\" label, the complaint alleges no facts that would bring that label into play.  See Shaw v. Digital Equipment Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1216 (1st Cir.1996).  The term normally refers to a governmental standard, preferentially favorable to one race or another, for the distribution of benefits.  E.g., Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226-27, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13;  City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493, 109 S.Ct. 706, 721, 102 L.Ed.2d 854 (1989) (plurality opinion).  Yet under the plan adopted in this case, the apartments freed from the statutory preference are made available to all applicants regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">West End Place was built with federal help and its apartments made especially desirable through federal subsidies.  It might not seem remarkable that the government should insist, as a condition of this investment, that a fair number of the apartments should be effectively open to application by tenants of all races.  Nor have we been able to find any case where the government has been required to show a compelling interest, or narrow tailoring of remedies, for a condition framed so as to secure equal treatment of applicants regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language in a few Supreme Court decisions could be taken to mean that any action in which race plays a role is constitutionally suspect.  However, the governmental actions in those cases were fundamentally different and more provocative.  In Adarand, the statute gave special incentives to government contractors to hire minority subcontractors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The redistricting cases concern state voting districts designed to concentrate minority voters and effectively to reserve seats for minority candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken by itself, HUD's action in this case is almost the opposite of the racial preferences that the Court viewed as questionable in Adarand and the redistricting cases.  Here, the government's condition on federal funds was that some of the apartments--which otherwise would have almost automatically been occupied by whites--be made available to all applicants on a race-blind basis.  We cannot view this as a \"racial classification[ ]\" reserving benefits for a favored race, Adarand, 515 U.S. at 235, 115 S.Ct. at 2116-17, or as \"an effort to segregate the races,\" Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642-43, 113 S.Ct. at 2823-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other equal protection arguments made by the former West Enders need no lengthy discussion, either because they have been essentially abandoned on appeal or because they are clearly unpersuasive.  The former category includes the former West Enders' attack on HUD requirements that the apartments be publicized in minority communities;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  the latter includes the attempt to charge HUD with treating the consent decree's numerical \"goal\" as if it were a quota--a notion belied by the substantial preference retained for the former West Enders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story, however, is not quite over.  It is one thing for HUD to insist that the apartments it subsidizes must effectively be open to all races;  it would be quite another if HUD planned to impose this requirement only where the beneficiaries of the statutory preference were white.  That, we think, would be government action based on a \"racial classification\" and would need to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that we are dealing here with an ad hoc administrative action.  Accepting the truth of the complaint's factual allegations, HUD's actions were prompted not by any general, racially skewed policy toward statutory preferences but by the peculiar interplay of Boston's consent decree, the Massachusetts statute, and the respective racial makeups of the Boston population and the former West Enders.  What HUD would do in some other, hypothetical case is unknown, but it is certainly not precluded, either by the consent decree or anything else, from challenging statutory preferences that exclude whites.  Cf. Otero v. New York City Hous.  Auth., 484 F.2d 1122, 1125 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have alleged no facts that, if proven, would reveal any secret discriminatory standard, pattern of past practice, or motive beyond the one HUD has admitted, namely HUD's concern that the preference in this instance, if unmodified, would restrict the apartments to whites and subject HUD to sanctions under the consent decree.  Plaintiffs simply think that this purpose is enough to condemn HUD's action.  For the reasons already given, we do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to plaintiffs' second and distinct claim on appeal that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  121B, &#167; 49, \"has the effect of creating a trust for the benefit of people displaced by urban renewal.\"   The district court ruled that there was no demonstrated legislative intent to create a trust and that the trust argument failed for a further more technical reason.  See 958 F.Supp. at 700 (citing New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, 337 Mass. 342, 348, 149 N.E.2d 598, 601-02 (1958)).  On appeal, plaintiffs devote five pages of their brief to discussing the requisites for trust creation under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not Massachusetts law created a trust for the former West Enders appears to us to be beside the point.  If we assume arguendo that the former West Enders are entitled to, and can enforce, whatever priority is provided under section 49, subject always to superseding federal law, the trust concept is nothing more than a possible alternative remedy for enforcing any unpreempted rights that section 49 may provide.  The question to be answered, before remedies are even pertinent, is the extent of those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms section 49(c) creates a priority for displaced former residents, and subsection (d) arguably qualifies this priority by also obligating the developer to comply with \"requirements of federal legislation or regulations under which loans, grants, or contributions have been made or agreed to be made to meet a part of the cost of the project.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  121B, &#167; 49(d).  The defendants' position, adopted by the district court, is that such federal requirements--as a matter of Massachusetts law--qualify the statutory priority.  Plaintiffs have not challenged this ruling on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs might have argued that the limitation adopted here is not itself a \"requirement\" of \"federal legislation or regulations\" but is merely a developer proposal that HUD has chosen to bless.  Possibly, plaintiffs thought that this arguable distinction did not matter because a federal administrative measure, even if not statute or regulation, might override state legislation under the Supremacy Clause--assuming always that it was an authorized measure.  This is by no means clear, but arguments on this point have not been made and need not be pursued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, it appears that plaintiffs' trust argument may have been advanced primarily as an adjunct to a different constitutional claim, namely a claim that the plan in question impaired a property interest without due process or just compensation.  The alleged trust, in this context, would be a way of expressing a claimed property interest.  It is not obvious why a trust interest would be more entitled to this status than section 49's simple expression of a priority in favor of former tenants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, whether called a trust or something else, any property interest created by section 49(c) is arguably subject to section 49's own explicit reservation in section 49(d).  As already noted, the plaintiffs on this appeal have not challenged the district court ruling that subsection (d) qualifies subsection (c) and also embraces the disputed plan.  Taking these district court rulings as unchallenged, the trust argument adds nothing to the due process argument, which itself has not itself been renewed in the plaintiffs' briefs in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a case that stirs conflicting sympathies, for those ousted from their West End neighborhood by \"urban renewal\" many years ago no less than for minorities wrongly denied fair housing opportunities in Boston.  But we have properly sought to decide this appeal based upon Supreme Court precedent, as best we can discern it, recognizing that the case is a difficult and unusual one on the edge of developing law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is for me considerable appeal in the majority's resolution of plaintiffs' equal protection claims.  The governmental conduct these claims challenge involves a patently good faith and facially reasonable effort to accommodate the competing interests of two historic losers in Boston's housing wars:  the racial and ethnic minorities entitled to invoke the protections of the consent decree in NAACP v. Kemp and federal fair housing laws, and the former West Enders, an ethnically diverse, lower middle class group which, in the name of \"urban renewal,\" was forced from its neighborhood and could not afford to return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, I cannot join the portion of the majority opinion that affirms the district court's pleadings-based dismissal of the equal protection claims.  While I agree with the majority that reverse discrimination claims like the present one are \"on the edge of developing law,\" ante at 18, I do think it settled that, when the government withdraws benefits from a class of citizens because of the race or ethnicity of the class, courts are to scrutinize strictly the government's conduct so as to ensure that it furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.  See Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 226-227, 115 S.Ct. 2097, 2112-13, 132 L.Ed.2d 158 (1995).  For the reasons that follow, I believe plaintiffs' complaint fairly alleges such a withdrawal of benefits.  And I do not see how we can, at this stage of the litigation, conclude that such a withdrawal of benefits passes strict scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint alleges that the governmental defendants curtailed plaintiffs' statutory preference in order to comply with the consent decree in NAACP v. Kemp.  See ante at 14.   Because the purpose of that consent decree is \"the achievement of a racial composition, in HUD-assisted housing located in neighborhoods which are predominantly white, which reflects the racial composition of the City of Boston as a whole,\" id. at 14, a reasonable inference to be drawn from plaintiffs' complaint, see Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d 10, 13 (1st Cir.1997) (reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the party opposing a Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion), is that defendants acted as they did because the putative plaintiff class was predominantly white.  The fact that defendants \"do not dispute\" this accusation, ante at 16, only underscores our obligation to subject defendants' conduct to strict scrutiny, see Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224, 115 S.Ct. at 2111 (\"[A]ny person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reaches a contrary conclusion--that strict scrutiny does not apply--because it regards the facts plaintiffs have pleaded in support of their equal protection claims insufficient to describe a \"racial classification.\"   See ante at 16-17 (holding that this case is outside the principle of Adarand).   In reaching its conclusion, the majority emphasizes the effect of curtailing the preference on non-parties to this litigation, see ante at 16 (\"[T]he apartments freed from the statutory preference are made available to all applicants regardless of race.\"), and the defendants' intent in enacting the curtailment, see id. at 16 (\"It might not seem remarkable that the government should insist ... that a fair number of the apartments should be effectively open to application by tenants of all races.\").  The majority also reads the complaint to allege only that defendants acted as they did because plaintiffs are racially identifiable;  it does not read the complaint to allege that defendants acted as they did because plaintiffs are white.  Id. at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking this last point first, I simply disagree with the majority's reading of the complaint.  The complaint does not allege that the preference was curtailed because plaintiffs are racially monolithic;  it alleges that the preference was curtailed because of the consent decree.  And, as I have stated, because the consent decree operates only in favor of racial and ethnic minorities, it could not be read to require curtailment of the preference if the former West Enders were predominantly black.  Thus, for purposes of evaluating defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, I believe we must read into the complaint the allegation the majority believes necessary to trigger strict scrutiny, see ante at 17:  that defendants would not have acted as they did had the plaintiff class been predominantly of color.  See Aybar, 118 F.3d at 13;  see also Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 47-48, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102-03, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957) (Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2) does not require a complaint to set forth specific facts in support of a general allegation of discrimination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the majority has properly construed the complaint, I believe plaintiffs' equal protection claims are sufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion and to trigger strict scrutiny.  In the redistricting cases, the Supreme Court has emphasized that government action which subordinates race neutral considerations to an overriding racial purpose is constitutionally suspect:  \"We recognized in Shaw [v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 113 S.Ct. 2816, 125 L.Ed.2d 511 (1993)] that, outside the districting context, statutes are subject to strict scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause not just when they contain express racial classifications, but also when, though race neutral on their face, they are motivated by a racial purpose or object.\"  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 913, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2486-87, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995) (affirming the invalidation, under equal protection principles, of a Georgia congressional redistricting plan designed to increase the number of majority black districts in Georgia) (citation omitted).  It remains to be seen whether the Court will press this principle to its outer limit and strictly scrutinize even governmental conduct which, though predominantly motivated by a racial purpose, would not appear to burden any person because of his or her race--e.g., a public university's efforts at recruiting fully qualified applicants of color for its first year law school class.  But it seems apparent that defendants' lack of hostility towards whites in particular, cf. ante at 16, does not shield their conduct--which has burdened plaintiffs because they are, as a group, racially identifiable--from the most searching judicial inquiry.  See Miller, 515 U.S. at 913, 115 S.Ct. at 2486-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to a final point.  I think the majority runs afoul of Adarand in concentrating its focus so heavily on both defendants' intent and the effect of defendants' actions on non-parties to this case.  The Supreme Court has squarely rejected the argument that classifications motivated by \"benign\" considerations should not be scrutinized strictly.  See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226, 115 S.Ct. at 2112.   And though this case does appear unique in that the government conduct at issue is more a withdrawal of a special benefit from whites than a giving of special benefits to members of minority groups,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> the clear import of Adarand is that it is the plaintiff's \"personal right to equal protection of the laws,\" 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13, and not some non-party's interest in competing for that which would be the plaintiff's but for his or her race, that is constitutionally safeguarded.  Thus, in evaluating the constitutionality of defendants' conduct, we must not look to its effect and motivation with respect to others;  we must look at its effect and motivation with respect to plaintiffs.  And here, quite clearly, defendants' conduct has had the effect of depriving plaintiffs of a benefit and was prompted by the fact that plaintiffs are mostly white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants' conduct should have been strictly scrutinized, their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' equal protection claim should have been denied and they should have been required to produce evidence that their conduct was narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest.  See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13 (reciting the components of the strict scrutiny inquiry);  see also Aiken v. City of Memphis, 37 F.3d 1155, 1163 (6th cir.1994) (\"When, as here, a race-based affirmative action plan is subjected to strict scrutiny, the party defending the plan bears the burden of producing evidence that the plan is constitutional.\").  Plaintiffs should then have been put to the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of defendants' conduct.  See Aiken, 37 F.3d at 1162 (\"The party challenging [a racially-preferential] plan retains the ultimate burden of proving its unconstitutionality.\").  To the extent that the majority has reached a different conclusion, I most respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The BRA is an entity established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to undertake urban renewal projects and to relieve housing shortages.

They claim that Massachusetts law entitles them to first preference for tenancy of all new residential units built on the land, and that they are being denied this preference in a new development called West End Place because most former West Enders are white.  The district judge dismissed the complaint, leading to this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are undisputed.  In May 1956, the Boston Housing Authority, the forerunner to the current Boston Redevelopment Authority (\"the BRA\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> prepared a plan for urban renewal of Boston's Old West End, a downtown neighborhood lying just north of Beacon Hill.  The plan was approved as required under Massachusetts law, and in 1958, the BRA ordered a taking by eminent domain of a large area, displacing over three thousand households of diverse heritages, but including few African Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRA executed a lease agreement with a private developer, Charles River Park, Inc.  (\"Charles River\").  Over the next ten years, Charles River razed buildings in the Old West End and built offices, condominiums, and luxury residential units.  The new buildings were either nonresidential or so expensive that very few of the former West Enders could afford to occupy them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the BRA terminated Charles River as the project developer and, in 1986, solicited proposals for the development of Lowell Square, located at the intersection of Lomasney Way and Staniford Street, the only remaining large undeveloped section of the Old West End.  A proposal was submitted by the Lowell Square Cooperative Limited Partnership (the \"developer\") to build a new development called West End Place at Lowell Square.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BRA eventually awarded the developer the redevelopment contract.  One restriction in the agreement between the BRA and the developer mirrors a provision of Massachusetts law requiring the BRA to obligate the developer as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>(c) to give preference in the selection of tenants for dwelling units built in the project area to families displaced therefrom because of clearance and renewal activity who desire to live in such dwelling units and who will be able to pay rents or prices equal to rents or prices charged other families for similar or comparable dwelling units built as a part of the same redevelopment;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>(d) to comply with such other conditions as are deemed necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, or requirements of federal legislation or regulations under which loans, grants or contributions have been made or agreed to be made to meet a part of the cost of the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mass. Gen.

To that end, a number of former West Enders formed the Old West End Housing Corporation.  This nonprofit entity and the developer signed a participation agreement, which stated, inter alia, that former West Enders would have first preference in the purchase or rental of residential units in West End Place, subject to applicable local, state, and federal laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer sought out numerous sources of financing, including government funding from local, state, and federal agencies.  In particular, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") funded a grant of $2.5 million for construction, and it also committed $7 million in rent subsidies for the low-income units in West End Place.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1437f (1994).  Like most federal housing assistance, these funds were contingent on compliance with federal fair housing requirements.  See 24 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1.5, 5.105 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One such requirement is that developer recipients of federal housing funds must carry out an affirmative program to attract minority, as well as majority, applicants;  the pertinent regulation contemplates mailings to minority organizations, assurances of nondiscrimination, and like measures.  Each applicant is required to set forth its \"affirmative fair housing marketing plan\" on a HUD form and secure its approval by HUD.  See 24 C.F.R. &#167; 200.620 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, HUD is subject to a 1991 consent decree based on a finding that HUD had failed to meet statutory obligations to ensure that the minority population of Boston had equal access to public housing.  NAACP, Boston Chapter v. Kemp, No. 78-850-S (D.Mass. Mar. 8, 1991) (consent decree).  The consent decree provides that all Boston area HUD affirmative fair housing marketing plans \"shall have as their goal and measure of success the achievement of a racial composition, in HUD-assisted housing located in neighborhoods which are predominantly white, which reflects the racial composition of the City [of Boston] as a whole.\"  Id. at 2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In preparing its affirmative fair housing marketing plan, the developer attempted to reconcile the explicit statutory obligation of a first preference for former West Enders with HUD's consent-decree goal of a tenancy reflecting the makeup of the City of Boston.  Minority races made up 41 percent of Boston's population, but according to HUD's estimate, only about 2 percent of the former West Enders.  HUD indicated that it viewed an unqualified preference for former West Enders as contrary to federal fair housing requirements and the consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer, the government agencies, and the Old West End Housing Corporation submitted the matter to mediation.  The mediator, a former United States Attorney for Massachusetts, proposed that former West Enders receive a preference as to 55 percent of the units in West End Place, and all other applicants have equal access to the remaining 45 percent.  The developer and the agencies agreed;  the Old West End Housing Corporation did not.  Nevertheless, the mediator's solution was included in the developer's affirmative fair housing marketing plan, which HUD approved in 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan operates as follows.  West End Place contains 183 residential units that fall into three rent-based categories:  58 \"low-income\" units (subsidized by HUD funds), 48 \"moderate-income units,\" and 77 units to be rented at market rates.  Under the plan, the developer is to give former West Enders first preference as to 101 of 183 units, that is, 55 percent of the total.  These 101 units are unevenly distributed over the three rent categories:  former West Enders have a preference as to 19 low-income units (33 percent), 24 moderate-income units (50 percent), and 58 market-rate units (75 percent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tenant selection works by lottery.  Each preliminary application is assigned a random number.  The applications are then separated into two pools:  pool A contains applications from displaced former West Enders and pool B contains all other applicants.  Then, for the low-income units, the top-ranked applicant from pool A is selected, followed by the two top-ranked applicants from pool B;  this yields a total of 33 percent pool A applicants (33 percent former West Enders) in the low-income units.  The process is then repeated until all 58 units are tentatively allocated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same lottery approach is used for the other two categories of apartments.  For moderate-income units, the draw ratio is one-to-one (50 percent former West Enders);  for the market-rate units, three-to-one (75 percent former West Enders).  Applicants who have been selected in this process are then invited to complete a full application and undergo a more thorough screening process, which can include verifications of personal references and credit history.  The same process can supply additional applicants if needed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From August 26 to September 26, 1996, a real estate manager hired by the developer coordinated community outreach efforts to stimulate preliminary applications.  The manager also contacted former West Enders as well as the Old West End Housing Corporation.  The manager eventually received 1,858 timely preliminary applications, 308 of which identified the applicants as former West Enders.  Of the 308 former West Ender applicants, 12 identified themselves as black, one as Latino, and 19 did not identify their race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 26, 1996, the individual plaintiffs--four former West Enders--filed a complaint in the district court challenging the tenant selection process and the plan on numerous grounds;  they purported to represent former West Enders as a class.  The Old West End Housing Corporation was also named as a plaintiff.  The numerous defendants divide into four categories:  the BRA and its director;  HUD and its Secretary;  the City of Boston and various of its officials;  and, finally, the developer and other private parties associated with the development of West End Place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 21, 1996, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a preliminary injunction to halt the lottery, which was later withdrawn when the defendants agreed to let the former West Enders' representatives monitor the lottery.  In the lottery, which took place on October 29, 1996, two of the named plaintiffs received rankings in the lottery that make it unlikely that they will receive units in West End Place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The developer and various other defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and the district court heard argument on the motion on November 20, 1996.

HUD is a federal entity not subject to section 1983, but its officials are directly constrained by equal protection principles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their complaint, the former West Enders allege that race was a motive for curtailing the statutory preference otherwise available to them.  Specifically, the complaint cites the defendants' reliance upon the consent decree as comprising a racial purpose and goal and asserts that, as a result, the former West Enders were deprived of a benefit--a statutory preference for all of the apartments--based upon \"a racial classification.\"   In their appeal brief, plaintiffs' shorthand version is that the preference was curtailed \"because\" the former West Enders were predominantly white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factual assertions in a complaint are normally accepted as true for purposes of a motion to dismiss, see, e.g., Berner v. Delahanty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197623\"><a href=\"/opinion/197623/berner-v-delahanty/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.1997);  in addition, the defendants do not dispute that racial concerns and the consent decree prompted their effort to cut back upon the statutory preference.  The reason is apparent:  the former West Enders are almost entirely white, and without some limitation on the preference rights of former West Enders, HUD would have been funding subsidized apartments from which minorities were effectively excluded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">HUD apparently thought that this outcome would violate the consent decree and its statutory obligation to promote fair housing.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3601-3619 (1994);  24 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 200.600-200.640 (1997).  HUD may have misunderstood both the consent decree and the federal statute, but whether it did or not, its purpose to increase minority opportunities for apartments in West End Place by curtailing the statutory preference is evident.  To this end, it appears that HUD simply declined to authorize funding unless and until some of the apartments were made available to applicants other than former West Enders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This undenied racial motive distinguishes the case from those others involving facially neutral actions--like a zoning law or employee qualification test--where the state actor denies any racial purpose or concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  But the plaintiffs are mistaken in treating \"racial motive\" as a synonym for a constitutional violation.  Every antidiscrimination statute aimed at racial discrimination, and every enforcement measure taken under such a statute, reflect a concern with race.  That does not make such enactments or actions unlawful or automatically \"suspect\" under the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is quite true that government action taken out of hostility to a racial group can be condemned out of hand, e.g., Yick Wo v. Hopkins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 373-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span> (1886), but there is no allegation whatever in the complaint that the defendants were hostile to whites.  Nor would any such motive be remotely plausible.  Benign intentions do not immunize government action, but they substantially narrow the inquiry.  The primary test is that any government action--regardless of benign intent--is suspect if it has been taken on the basis of a \"racial classification\";  in such cases, the classification must be justified by a compelling state interest and narrow tailoring.

See Shaw v.

The term normally refers to a governmental standard, preferentially favorable to one race or another, for the distribution of benefits.  E.g., Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226-27, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13;  City of Richmond v. J.A.

Yet under the plan adopted in this case, the apartments freed from the statutory preference are made available to all applicants regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">West End Place was built with federal help and its apartments made especially desirable through federal subsidies.  It might not seem remarkable that the government should insist, as a condition of this investment, that a fair number of the apartments should be effectively open to application by tenants of all races.  Nor have we been able to find any case where the government has been required to show a compelling interest, or narrow tailoring of remedies, for a condition framed so as to secure equal treatment of applicants regardless of race.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Language in a few Supreme Court decisions could be taken to mean that any action in which race plays a role is constitutionally suspect.  However, the governmental actions in those cases were fundamentally different and more provocative.  In Adarand, the statute gave special incentives to government contractors to hire minority subcontractors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The redistricting cases concern state voting districts designed to concentrate minority voters and effectively to reserve seats for minority candidates.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken by itself, HUD's action in this case is almost the opposite of the racial preferences that the Court viewed as questionable in Adarand and the redistricting cases.  Here, the government's condition on federal funds was that some of the apartments--which otherwise would have almost automatically been occupied by whites--be made available to all applicants on a race-blind basis.  We cannot view this as a \"racial classification[ ]\" reserving benefits for a favored race, Adarand, 515 U.S. at 235, 115 S.Ct. at 2116-17, or as \"an effort to segregate the races,\" Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642-43, 113 S.Ct. at 2823-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several other equal protection arguments made by the former West Enders need no lengthy discussion, either because they have been essentially abandoned on appeal or because they are clearly unpersuasive.  The former category includes the former West Enders' attack on HUD requirements that the apartments be publicized in minority communities;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  the latter includes the attempt to charge HUD with treating the consent decree's numerical \"goal\" as if it were a quota--a notion belied by the substantial preference retained for the former West Enders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The story, however, is not quite over.  It is one thing for HUD to insist that the apartments it subsidizes must effectively be open to all races;  it would be quite another if HUD planned to impose this requirement only where the beneficiaries of the statutory preference were white.  That, we think, would be government action based on a \"racial classification\" and would need to be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difficulty is that we are dealing here with an ad hoc administrative action.  Accepting the truth of the complaint's factual allegations, HUD's actions were prompted not by any general, racially skewed policy toward statutory preferences but by the peculiar interplay of Boston's consent decree, the Massachusetts statute, and the respective racial makeups of the Boston population and the former West Enders.  What HUD would do in some other, hypothetical case is unknown, but it is certainly not precluded, either by the consent decree or anything else, from challenging statutory preferences that exclude whites.  Cf. Otero v. New York City Hous.  Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"313521\"><a href=\"/opinion/313521/francisco-otero-v-new-york-city-housing-authority-akiva-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></a></span>, 1125 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have alleged no facts that, if proven, would reveal any secret discriminatory standard, pattern of past practice, or motive beyond the one HUD has admitted, namely HUD's concern that the preference in this instance, if unmodified, would restrict the apartments to whites and subject HUD to sanctions under the consent decree.  Plaintiffs simply think that this purpose is enough to condemn HUD's action.  For the reasons already given, we do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to plaintiffs' second and distinct claim on appeal that Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  121B, &#167; 49, \"has the effect of creating a trust for the benefit of people displaced by urban renewal.\"   The district court ruled that there was no demonstrated legislative intent to create a trust and that the trust argument failed for a further more technical reason.  See 958 F.Supp. at 700 (citing New England Trust Co. v. Sanger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246339\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246339/new-england-trust-co-v-sanger/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 348, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246339\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246339/new-england-trust-co-v-sanger/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 601-02 (1958)).  On appeal, plaintiffs devote five pages of their brief to discussing the requisites for trust creation under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not Massachusetts law created a trust for the former West Enders appears to us to be beside the point.  If we assume arguendo that the former West Enders are entitled to, and can enforce, whatever priority is provided under section 49, subject always to superseding federal law, the trust concept is nothing more than a possible alternative remedy for enforcing any unpreempted rights that section 49 may provide.  The question to be answered, before remedies are even pertinent, is the extent of those rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms section 49(c) creates a priority for displaced former residents, and subsection (d) arguably qualifies this priority by also obligating the developer to comply with \"requirements of federal legislation or regulations under which loans, grants, or contributions have been made or agreed to be made to meet a part of the cost of the project.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  121B, &#167; 49(d).  The defendants' position, adopted by the district court, is that such federal requirements--as a matter of Massachusetts law--qualify the statutory priority.  Plaintiffs have not challenged this ruling on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs might have argued that the limitation adopted here is not itself a \"requirement\" of \"federal legislation or regulations\" but is merely a developer proposal that HUD has chosen to bless.  Possibly, plaintiffs thought that this arguable distinction did not matter because a federal administrative measure, even if not statute or regulation, might override state legislation under the Supremacy Clause--assuming always that it was an authorized measure.  This is by no means clear, but arguments on this point have not been made and need not be pursued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, it appears that plaintiffs' trust argument may have been advanced primarily as an adjunct to a different constitutional claim, namely a claim that the plan in question impaired a property interest without due process or just compensation.  The alleged trust, in this context, would be a way of expressing a claimed property interest.  It is not obvious why a trust interest would be more entitled to this status than section 49's simple expression of a priority in favor of former tenants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, whether called a trust or something else, any property interest created by section 49(c) is arguably subject to section 49's own explicit reservation in section 49(d).  As already noted, the plaintiffs on this appeal have not challenged the district court ruling that subsection (d) qualifies subsection (c) and also embraces the disputed plan.  Taking these district court rulings as unchallenged, the trust argument adds nothing to the due process argument, which itself has not itself been renewed in the plaintiffs' briefs in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a case that stirs conflicting sympathies, for those ousted from their West End neighborhood by \"urban renewal\" many years ago no less than for minorities wrongly denied fair housing opportunities in Boston.  But we have properly sought to decide this appeal based upon Supreme Court precedent, as best we can discern it, recognizing that the case is a difficult and unusual one on the edge of developing law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is for me considerable appeal in the majority's resolution of plaintiffs' equal protection claims.  The governmental conduct these claims challenge involves a patently good faith and facially reasonable effort to accommodate the competing interests of two historic losers in Boston's housing wars:  the racial and ethnic minorities entitled to invoke the protections of the consent decree in NAACP v. Kemp and federal fair housing laws, and the former West Enders, an ethnically diverse, lower middle class group which, in the name of \"urban renewal,\" was forced from its neighborhood and could not afford to return.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, I cannot join the portion of the majority opinion that affirms the district court's pleadings-based dismissal of the equal protection claims.  While I agree with the majority that reverse discrimination claims like the present one are \"on the edge of developing law,\" ante at 18, I do think it settled that, when the government withdraws benefits from a class of citizens because of the race or ethnicity of the class, courts are to scrutinize strictly the government's conduct so as to ensure that it furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to advance that interest.

The fact that defendants \"do not dispute\" this accusation, ante at 16, only underscores our obligation to subject defendants' conduct to strict scrutiny, see Adarand, 515 U.S. at 224, 115 S.Ct. at 2111 (\"[A]ny person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority reaches a contrary conclusion--that strict scrutiny does not apply--because it regards the facts plaintiffs have pleaded in support of their equal protection claims insufficient to describe a \"racial classification.\"   See ante at 16-17 (holding that this case is outside the principle of Adarand).   In reaching its conclusion, the majority emphasizes the effect of curtailing the preference on non-parties to this litigation, see ante at 16 (\"[T]he apartments freed from the statutory preference are made available to all applicants regardless of race.\"), and the defendants' intent in enacting the curtailment, see id. at 16 (\"It might not seem remarkable that the government should insist ... that a fair number of the apartments should be effectively open to application by tenants of all races.\").  The majority also reads the complaint to allege only that defendants acted as they did because plaintiffs are racially identifiable;  it does not read the complaint to allege that defendants acted as they did because plaintiffs are white.  Id. at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking this last point first, I simply disagree with the majority's reading of the complaint.  The complaint does not allege that the preference was curtailed because plaintiffs are racially monolithic;  it alleges that the preference was curtailed because of the consent decree.  And, as I have stated, because the consent decree operates only in favor of racial and ethnic minorities, it could not be read to require curtailment of the preference if the former West Enders were predominantly black.  Thus, for purposes of evaluating defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion, I believe we must read into the complaint the allegation the majority believes necessary to trigger strict scrutiny, see ante at 17:  that defendants would not have acted as they did had the plaintiff class been predominantly of color.

Gibson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 47-48, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the redistricting cases, the Supreme Court has emphasized that government action which subordinates race neutral considerations to an overriding racial purpose is constitutionally suspect:  \"We recognized in Shaw [v. Reno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 913, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It remains to be seen whether the Court will press this principle to its outer limit and strictly scrutinize even governmental conduct which, though predominantly motivated by a racial purpose, would not appear to burden any person because of his or her race--e.g., a public university's efforts at recruiting fully qualified applicants of color for its first year law school class.  But it seems apparent that defendants' lack of hostility towards whites in particular, cf. ante at 16, does not shield their conduct--which has burdened plaintiffs because they are, as a group, racially identifiable--from the most searching judicial inquiry.  See Miller, 515 U.S. at 913, 115 S.Ct. at 2486-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leads to a final point.  I think the majority runs afoul of Adarand in concentrating its focus so heavily on both defendants' intent and the effect of defendants' actions on non-parties to this case.  The Supreme Court has squarely rejected the argument that classifications motivated by \"benign\" considerations should not be scrutinized strictly.  See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 226, 115 S.Ct. at 2112.   And though this case does appear unique in that the government conduct at issue is more a withdrawal of a special benefit from whites than a giving of special benefits to members of minority groups,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> the clear import of Adarand is that it is the plaintiff's \"personal right to equal protection of the laws,\" 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13, and not some non-party's interest in competing for that which would be the plaintiff's but for his or her race, that is constitutionally safeguarded.  Thus, in evaluating the constitutionality of defendants' conduct, we must not look to its effect and motivation with respect to others;  we must look at its effect and motivation with respect to plaintiffs.  And here, quite clearly, defendants' conduct has had the effect of depriving plaintiffs of a benefit and was prompted by the fact that plaintiffs are mostly white.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because defendants' conduct should have been strictly scrutinized, their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' equal protection claim should have been denied and they should have been required to produce evidence that their conduct was narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest.  See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 227, 115 S.Ct. at 2112-13 (reciting the components of the strict scrutiny inquiry);  see also Aiken v. City of Memphis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679988\"><a href=\"/opinion/679988/russell-aiken-92-6154-william-ashton-92-6159-v-the-city-of-memphis/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span>, 1163 (6th cir.1994) (\"When, as here, a race-based affirmative action plan is subjected to strict scrutiny, the party defending the plan bears the burden of producing evidence that the plan is constitutional.\").  Plaintiffs should then have been put to the burden of proving the unconstitutionality of defendants' conduct.  See Aiken, 37 F.3d at 1162 (\"The party challenging [a racially-preferential] plan retains the ultimate burden of proving its unconstitutionality.\").
