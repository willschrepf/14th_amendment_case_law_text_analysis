In August 1973 the district court, in a decision reported at 363 F.Supp. 739, found that \"the cumulative effect of the actions of the state and local defendants has been the creation, operation, support, and general supervision by the State of Missouri of a small school district which is unconstitutionally segregated and whose students are denied an equal educational opportunity.\"  363 F.Supp. at 749.

We denied the government's motion for summary reversal but established an expedited briefing schedule and directed the parties to include in their briefs a discussion of the following: \"Justification (or lack thereof) for (1) the delay in integration of students, (2) the delay in integration of faculty, and (3) the immediate increase in the tax rate in the district without significant integration of students and faculty and other benefits related thereto.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States contends that no extraordinary circumstances that could justify delay in implementing desegregation have been shown in this case<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and that further delay is no longer constitutionally permissible.

The government urges that we reverse that part of the order which delays implementation of effective desegregation until the beginning of the 1976-77 school year and that we direct that implementation of the desegregation plan be required no later than the beginning of the second semester of the 1975-76 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellees, Ferguson Reorganized School District R II and Berkeley School District, urge that we affirm the district court's order of June 7, 1975.

This report, although formerly geared to desegregation of students and teachers beginning with the 1975-76 school year, will now cover the steps that have been taken to raise immediately the level of the educational program at Kinloch as well as accomplish the complete desegregation of the reorganized district commencing with the beginning of the school year 1976-77.  It will include, among other things, the matters mentioned above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that this court should refrain from taking any further action in this case pending the filing of the October 15, 1975, progress report by the reorganized school district.  The district court shall grant all parties a reasonable length of time in which to respond to the report, hold hearings if necessary, and make such further orders deemed appropriate to equalizing the level of the educational program at Kinloch and accomplishing complete student and faculty desegregation commencing with the beginning of the school year 1976-77.  The district court, in order to insure that there is no delay in the full and timely implementation of the desegregation plan, is directed to require additional periodic reports prior to June 1, 1976.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government also points out that it is difficult for it to respond to this court's inquiries concerning the justification for delay in integration of students and faculty and the immediate increase in the tax rate because the district court without explanation delayed desegregation for one year.  No hearings were held or evidence taken regarding the need for delay in implementing the desegregation ordered in January 1975.  Appellees respond that although no formal hearings were held, extensive conferences were held, attended by government counsel and all other parties; further, that the only conduct on the part of the government indicating a negative attitude toward the order was at the time it was signed when counsel for the government indicated he could not bind the Department of Justice and may have added, \"We may appeal.\"  Government counsel maintains that he made known the government's view that the plan ought to be implemented with the beginning of the fall (1975-76) term</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Under explicit holdings of the Supreme Court, it is the obligation of every school district to terminate dual school systems at once.  Delays pending appeals, absent extraordinary circumstances, will not be tolerated.  Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 390 U.S. 19, 96 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19 (1969); Carter v.

This report, although formerly geared to desegregation of students and teachers beginning with the 1975-76 school year, will now cover the steps that have been taken to raise immediately the level of the educational program at Kinloch as well as accomplish the complete desegregation of the reorganized district commencing with the beginning of the school year 1976-77.

The district court shall grant all parties a reasonable length of time in which to respond to the report, hold hearings if necessary, and make such further orders deemed appropriate to equalizing the level of the educational program at Kinloch and accomplishing complete student and faculty desegregation commencing with the beginning of the school year 1976-77.  The district court, in order to insure that there is no delay in the full and timely implementation of the desegregation plan, is directed to require additional periodic reports prior to June 1, 1976.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remanded for further action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The government also points out that it is difficult for it to respond to this court's inquiries concerning the justification for delay in integration of students and faculty and the immediate increase in the tax rate because the district court without explanation delayed desegregation for one year.  No hearings were held or evidence taken regarding the need for delay in implementing the desegregation ordered in January 1975.  Appellees respond that although no formal hearings were held, extensive conferences were held, attended by government counsel and all other parties; further, that the only conduct on the part of the government indicating a negative attitude toward the order was at the time it was signed when counsel for the government indicated he could not bind the Department of Justice and may have added, \"We may appeal.\"  Government counsel maintains that he made known the government's view that the plan ought to be implemented with the beginning of the fall (1975-76) term</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Under explicit holdings of the Supreme Court, it is the obligation of every school district to terminate dual school systems at once.
