Mason, Esq.\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor\nBy: Sanjeev Bhasker, Esq.\nAssistant Prosecuting Attorney\nThe Justice Center\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\n\n\n\nJAMES J. SWEENEY, P.J.:\n\n      {¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Joel Ferren, (“defendant”) appeals from his\n\nconvictions and sentences following a jury trial in which he was found guilty of\n\nfifty one counts of sexual battery, six counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a\n\nminor, and carrying a concealed weapon. The court imposed an aggregate\n\nsixteen year prison sentence.\n\n      {¶ 2} Defendant was a music teacher in Bedford, Ohio.             Two of his\n\nviolin students, L.S. and V.D., 1 independently made statements to police\n\nreporting various incidents that had occurred between each of them and\n\n      1\n          It is the policy of this Court not to identify victims of sexual offenses.\n\fdefendant during the course of their respective violin lessons with defendant.\n\nThe victims do not know each other.\n\n     {¶ 3} Defendant was born September 17, 1946.        L.S.’s date of birth is\n\nOctober 29, 1982 and V.D.’s date of birth is October 5, 1993.       L.S. began\n\nlessons with defendant around July of 1995, which ceased when she left for\n\ncollege in 2001. V.D. began her lessons with defendant in the fall of 2005,\n\nwhich continued until March of 2008. V.D. was the first to make a statement\n\nto police in March of 2008.    Thereafter L.S. learned of V.D.’s allegations\n\nagainst defendant from media coverage, which prompted L.S. to contact the\n\npolice and provide her statement.\n\n     {¶ 4} The grand jury returned a sixty-one count indictment, charging\n\ndefendant with multiple counts of sexual battery and unlawful sexual conduct\n\nwith a minor as well as a CCW count. Counts 1 through 53 identified the\n\nvictim as “Jane Doe #1” which was amended to be L.S. and counts 54 through\n\n60 identified “Jane Doe #2” which was later amended to be V.D.\n\n     {¶ 5} The first 53 counts of the indictment set forth the dates of offenses\n\nin monthly increments beginning with count 1 being “on or about August 1,\n\n1996 to August 31, 1996” and so forth, ending with count 53 being “on or about\n\nOctober 1, 2000 to October 28, 2000.” The sole exceptions being counts 11, 12,\n\n21, and 22; which broke June of 1997 into two separate counts (11 and 12) and\n\nalso broke March of 1998 into two separate counts (21 and 22). Prior to trial,\n\fcount 11 was amended to include all of June 1997 and count 21 was amended\n\nto include all of March 1998. Counts 12 and 22 were then dismissed.\n\n      {¶ 6} Also prior to trial, counts 55 through 60 were amended to reflect\n\nthe dates of offense as October 1, 2007 through March 17, 2008 and count 54\n\nwas dismissed.\n\n      {¶ 7} The defense filed a motion to sever the counts involving L.S. from\n\nthose involving V.D. and sought an order for separate trials.       The state\n\nopposed the motion.\n\n      {¶ 8} The state filed a bill of particulars on November 13, 2009 and\n\ndefendant moved for a more specific bill of particulars on November 30, 2009.\n\n      {¶ 9} By order dated December 22, 2009, the trial court issued a journal\n\nentry granting defendant’s motion for a more particular bill of particulars and\n\ndenied his motion to sever counts. The state provided a supplemental bill of\n\nparticulars on February 25, 2010.\n\n      {¶ 10} At trial, V.D. testified that she began violin lessons with\n\ndefendant in the fall of 2005 when she was 12 years old. The lessons took\n\nplace at defendant’s studio in Bedford, Ohio. V.D. was home schooled and\n\ntook lessons on Friday mornings for one hour. V.D.’s family developed a close\n\nrelationship with defendant and defendant often ate dinner with them.\n\nDefendant told them he was 35 years old and a French baron. The family\n\nbelieved he owned a chateau in France and was the heir of a French duchess.\n\fHe told them he had a private jet and spent every weekend in France teaching\n\nmusic lessons. Defendant gave the family gifts and they celebrated birthdays\n\ntogether. In the summer of 2007, V.D. told her mother that defendant had\n\nkissed her neck. V.D.’s mother found this totally inappropriate and contacted\n\ndefendant. V.D.’s mother demanded that he never do that again.\n\n      {¶ 11} V.D. continued her violin lessons with defendant in 2007.    At that\n\ntime, V.D. began an apprenticeship with defendant in order to learn how to\n\nmake violins. The apprenticeship took place Mondays through Fridays. The\n\nhours varied but V.D. typically returned home between 10 and 11 p.m.\n\n      {¶ 12} V.D.     testified   that   approximately   two   weeks   into   the\n\napprenticeship defendant began kissing and fondling her.         Eventually this\n\nlead to V.D. engaging in sexual intercourse with defendant by the end of\n\nOctober 2007.       According to V.D. from that point until March 17, 2008, she\n\nengaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex with defendant on an average of\n\nthree times a week. Usually the incidents took place on the air mattress in\n\nthe studio’s back room; however, occasionally they would take place in the\n\nfront room. Defendant gave V.D. a lavender nightgown that was kept at the\n\nstudio and which she identified as State’s Exhibit 5. Although she wore it on\n\noccasion, V.D. said that she usually did not have time to put it on.     V.D. said\n\nshe felt guilty and told defendant she wanted to stop. However, they continued\n\nto engage in sexual relations until her parents were told about the\n\frelationship in March of 2008. During this time period, V.D. was 14 years\n\nold.\n\n       {¶ 13} V.D. gave a statement to police on March 21, 2008.    Det. Klubnik\n\nobtained a search warrant and seized various items from defendant’s music\n\nstudio, including the lavender lingerie, men’s pajamas, lotions, bedding, and\n\nKleenex. Forensic scientists of Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Identification and\n\nInvestigation (“BCI”) testified concerning tests conducted on some of these\n\nitems. Later, V.D. made a list of all the outfits she remembered wearing on\n\ndays that she engaged in sexual conduct with the defendant. She recalled\n\nthat he like certain outfits and she wore certain outfits to please him.\n\n       {¶ 14} No semen was found on the men’s pajama pants or the lingerie.\n\nDNA testing indicated the presence of mixed DNA profile on the lavender\n\nlingerie, with the major contributor being consistent with V.D.’s DNA profile\n\nand the minor contributor being consistent with defendant’s DNA profile.\n\n       {¶ 15} The state also presented the testimony of a woman, Maryann, who\n\nclaimed to be acquainted with defendant.       Maryann testified that she met\n\ndefendant in March of 1995 and the two were intimate for a brief period of\n\ntime. She claimed that defendant made certain comments to her about his\n\nstudents, including that he would like to get into the pants of a seven or eight\n\nyear old student but her parents were always present.            Defendant also\n\nallegedly commented to Maryann that he would really like to feel the breasts\n\fof another student who was 13 or 14 years old. Although Maryann said she\n\nfound these comments extremely inappropriate and felt very uncomfortable\n\nabout them, she never reported them to anyone.        Further, she initiated\n\ncontact with defendant in 2005 and “reconnected” with him. Maryann also\n\nasked for defendant’s help with one of her own students. When she learned of\n\nthis case through the media, Maryann contacted the police.\n\n     {¶ 16} On cross-examination, defense counsel solicited further comments\n\nfrom Maryann to the effect that defendant said he could not wait until the\n\nstudents turned eighteen. All of the alleged comments were made between\n\n1995 and 1997.\n\n     {¶ 17} L.S. testified that she met defendant in 1995 when she was in the\n\nseventh grade. L.S. kept a diary that included entries between January 28,\n\n1995 to August 1, 1996. L.S. took weekly lessons from defendant and by May\n\nof 1996, defendant was telling her that he loved her.        On July 4, 1996,\n\ndefendant proposed marriage to L.S. with an emerald ring. L.S. believed she\n\nwas engaged to defendant at this point. She was 13 years old. Defendant\n\ntold her not to tell her parents. Later that month, L.S. was in Europe with\n\nher cousins on a school trip and told them about her engagement to defendant.\n\nThe cousins, in turn, told her parents about it. L.S.’s mother and father both\n\ntestified that they were flabbergasted and shocked by this information. They\n\ncontacted defendant who came to their house.        They both recalled that\n\fdefendant expected the police to be there when he arrived. He apologized and\n\nsaid he had never done anything like that before. Defendant told them he\n\nwas 27 years old. L.S.’s parents terminated her violin lessons.\n\n        {¶ 18} L.S. said she became very upset by her parent’s decision because\n\nshe was in love with the defendant.        She pouted around the house and\n\neventually her parents accepted defendant’s offer to continue the violin\n\ninstructions at their home for free. L.S. said she resumed her lessons at her\n\nhome in Maple Heights in August of 1996. While L.S.’s parents were always\n\nhome when defendant was there, her parents would not be in the room with\n\nthem.\n\n        {¶ 19} Defendant would tell L.S. to wear certain clothes.      On one\n\noccasion she was wearing a red kilt skirt and defendant started kissing and\n\nhugging her.     A sexual relationship developed between them in August of\n\n1996, which included oral sex between them. This occurred at least once in\n\nAugust 1996, and continued at least once a month until she left for college.\n\nL.S. said the incidents occurred in her living room and also in her basement.\n\nL.S. believed that the defendant was about 27 years old. L.S. turned 18 years\n\nold in October of 2000 and defendant was not charged with any offenses\n\nagainst L.S. after that date.\n\f      {¶ 20} The state presented additional witnesses and defendant called\n\nseveral witnesses, whose testimony will be discussed to the extent necessary\n\nto address the issues on appeal.\n\n      {¶ 21} “I: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law and against double jeopardy, in violation of the 5th and 14th\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, in denying Defendant’s motion\n\nto dismiss the indictment and allowing Defendant to be tried under a\n\n‘carbon-copy’ indictment which failed to allege particularity in the allegations\n\nagainst Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 22} Defendant maintains that he was deprived of due process with\n\nrespect to the lack of specificity in the indictment and bill of particulars. In\n\nthis case, defendant was charged with engaging in multiple counts of sexual\n\nbattery involving L.S. Each count pertained to a separate month in a specific\n\nyear. Defendant asserts that the counts pertaining to V.D. did not, however,\n\nspecify a similar discrete time period because all counts identified the time\n\nperiod as on or about September 15, 2007 to March 17, 2008.\n\n      {¶ 23} The state indicated in the bill of particulars and supplemental bill\n\nof particulars that: (a) counts 1-51 took place at a specific residence in Maple\n\nHeights and occurred either on the first floor living room or the downstairs\n\nbasement; (b) counts 52-53 occurred at defendant’s Bedford studio; (c) that\n\ncounts 1-53 involved oral sex, physically intimate touching and fondling,\n\fsexual conduct and sexual contact but not vaginal intercourse; (d) that the\n\nvictim in counts 1-53 was a minor at the time of the incidents; (e) counts 54-60\n\ntook place at defendant’s music studio and involved oral sex, physical intimate\n\ntouching and fondling, sexual conduct and sexual contact, including vaginal\n\nintercourse; (f) the victim in counts 54-60 was a minor at the time of the\n\nincidents.\n\n      {¶ 24} Defendant maintains that the carbon-copy indictment deprived\n\nhim of due process rights, including the notice aspect, which he believes was\n\nnot cured by differentiation at trial. Defendant primarily relies on Russell\n\nv. United States (1962), 369 U.S. 749, 763-64, 82 S.Ct. 1038, 8 L.Ed.2d 240;\n\nValentine v. Konteh (C.A. 6, 2005), 395 F.3d 626, and State v. Holder,\n\nCuyahoga App. No. 89709, 2008-Ohio-1271.\n\n      {¶ 25} Russell requires that an indictment (1) contain the elements of the\n\noffense charged, (2) provide the defendant adequate notice of the charges\n\nagainst which he must defend, and (3) provide protection against double\n\njeopardy by enabling the defendant to plead an acquittal or conviction to bar\n\nfuture prosecutions for the same offense. Russell, 369 U.S. at 763-764.\n\n      {¶ 26} The distinct due process components involved in examining the\n\nsufficiency of an indictment include notice and double jeopardy. The vast\n\nmajority of cases from our district that have applied Valentine have been\n\nresolved under a double jeopardy analysis. E.g., State v. Hilton, Cuyahoga\n\fApp. No. 89220, 2008-Ohio-3010; State v. Ogle, Cuyahoga App. No. 87695,\n\n2007-Ohio-5066; State v. Yaacov, Cuyahoga App. No. 86674, 2006-Ohio-5321;\n\nState v. Hemphill, Cuyahoga App. No. 85431, 2005-Ohio-3726.            With the\n\nexception of this Court’s decision in Holder, this Court has addressed the\n\nnotice aspect of due process in terms of a carbon copy indictment and rejected\n\nit. See State v. Thomas, Cuyahoga App. No. 94492, 2011-Ohio-705, ¶22 (“in\n\ncases involving sexual offenses against children, indictments need not state\n\nwith specificity the dates of alleged abuse, so long as the prosecution\n\nestablishes that the offense was committed within the time frame alleged.”);\n\nState v. Wilson, Cuyahoga App. No. 92148, 2010-Ohio-550, appeal not allowed,\n\n125 Ohio St.3d 1450, 2010-Ohio-2510, 927 N.E.2d 1129.\n\n      {¶ 27} The Sixth Circuit in Valentine expressly rejected the notion that a\n\nlack of specificity as to dates and times in an indictment alleging child abuse\n\nviolated the notice requirements of due process. Valentine, 395 F.3d at 632.\n\nThe Court held, “[c]ertainly, prosecutors should be as specific as possible in\n\ndelineating the dates and times of abuse offenses, but we must acknowledge\n\nthe reality of situations where young child victims are involved. The Ohio\n\nCourt of Appeals found that there was no evidence the state had more specific\n\ninformation regarding the time period of the abuse. Valentine’s claims\n\nregarding the lack of time-and date-specific counts therefore fail.” Id.\n\f      {¶ 28} Defendant’s argument, which is premised on the date range of the\n\nindictment, is not sufficient to establish a deprivation of his due process\n\nrights. The state provided defendant with the information it had regarding\n\nthe time period of the abuse and both victims testified consistently with that\n\ninformation.   There is no evidence that the state had any more specific\n\ninformation regarding the time period of abuse than it had provided to\n\ndefendant.\n\n      {¶ 29} To the extent defendant maintains that the state failed to\n\ndifferentiate among the various counts, we disagree.      The state provided\n\ndefendant with notice prior to trial of the types of sexual conduct and contact\n\ninvolved with each victim. The victims testified with specificity, recalling at\n\ntimes, details of what they were wearing when various incidents occurred.\n\nThe reality of the victims’ testimony is that with each girl, defendant engaged\n\nin an on-going course of conduct over an extended period of time, rendering\n\nthem unable to pinpoint exact dates. The girls could not delineate each and\n\nevery sexual episode they had with the defendant, however, their testimony\n\nwas specific and established the counts of the indictment. L.S. was certain\n\ndefendant had engaged in oral sex with her, among other things, at least once\n\na month beginning in August of 1996 until October of 2000 at which time she\n\nturned eighteen.    Although she testified that the relationship continued\n\nthereafter, defendant was not charged with any crimes after she reached the\n\fage of majority. V.D. likewise testified that defendant engaged in sexual\n\nintercourse with her beginning in October of 2007, which continued on average\n\nthree times a week until March 17, 2008.\n\n      {¶ 30} In Holder, the court determined,\n\n      {¶ 31} “The State indicted Holder with five carbon copy rape counts, five\n\ncarbon copy gross sexual imposition counts, and two carbon copy sexual\n\nbattery counts. Holder timely raised his objection pursuant to Crim.R. 12(C).\n\nHowever, the prosecutor failed to respond with an amendment to the\n\nindictment or a supplemental bill of particulars to differentiate these counts\n\nfrom one another ‘such that a court in a second trial would be able to discern\n\nwhether there had been a previous finding of not guilty as to the alleged act.’\n\nTherefore, we find that the indictment was insufficient and the trial court did\n\nnot err in granting, in part, Holder’s motion to dismiss.” Holder,\n\n2008-Ohio-1271, ¶11.\n\n      {¶ 32} The state provided defendant with more specifics of the charges\n\nagainst defendant by way of a supplemental bill of particulars. Defendant\n\nwas apprised of the location of the incidents, the type of sexual activity\n\ninvolved, and the fact of the victim’s minority. This case is distinguishable\n\nfrom Holder where this court upheld the trial court’s partial dismissal of\n\ncertain counts of a carbon copy indictment when the state failed to provide any\n\nspecificity beyond what was contained in the indictment.\n\f      {¶ 33} “II: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, in failing to sever the charges against Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 34} Because defendant did not renew his objection to joinder at the\n\nclose of evidence, he has waived all but plain error. State v. Hill, Cuyahoga\n\nApp. No. 95379, 2011-Ohio-2523, ¶9.\n\n      {¶ 35} Pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A):\n\n      {¶ 36} “Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment,\n\ninformation or complaint in a separate count for each offense if the offenses\n\ncharged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar\n\ncharacter, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or\n\nmore acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a\n\ncommon scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.”\n\n      {¶ 37} A defendant may seek severance of counts but bears the burden of\n\nproving prejudice. Hill, 2011-Ohio-2523, ¶13, citing, Crim.R. 14.\n\n      {¶ 38} The state can counter a claim of prejudice in two ways: (1) the\n\n“other acts” test, which compels an Evid.R. 404(B) analysis; or (2) the “joinder\n\ntest” where the state must merely show that the evidence of each crime is\n\nsimple and direct. State v. Franklin (1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 118, 122, N.E.2d;\n\nsee, also, State v. Kirk, Cuyahoga App. No. 95261, 2011-Ohio-687, ¶40. “[I]f\n\nthe state can meet the joinder test, it need not meet the stricter ‘other acts’\n\ftest of Evid.R. 404(B).” State v. Mills (1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 362, 582\n\nN.E.2d 972.\n\n      {¶ 39} Despite defendant’s position to the contrary, we find that the\n\nevidence in this case satisfied the joinder test. The test does not depend on\n\nthe amount of evidence presented as to the joined offenses but instead whether\n\nthe jury was able to segregate the proof required for each of them.\n\n      {¶ 40} A trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for\n\nseverance of trials when the state presents evidence that is direct,\n\nuncomplicated, and the jury demonstrates its ability to segregate the proof on\n\neach charge. State v. Brooks (1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 185, 194, 542 N.E.2d 636.\n\nThe record presents clear and direct evidence as to each separate victim such\n\nthat the jury was readily able to segregate the proof on each charge.\n\n      {¶ 41} This assignment of error is overruled.\n\n      {¶ 42} “III: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution in permitting testimony of ‘other acts’ of the Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 43} Evid.R. 404(B) provides “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or\n\nacts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show\n\naction in conformity therewith.     It may, however, be admissible for other\n\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\n\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\n\f      {¶ 44} Under this assignment of error, defendant challenges the\n\nadmission of Maryann’s testimony concerning certain comments defendant\n\nallegedly made about some unidentified minor students sometime between\n\n1995 and 1997. The state first counters that these statements were properly\n\nadmitted as admissions pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2).\n\n      {¶ 45} Maryann alleged that defendant told her that he “would like to get\n\ninto her pants,” referring to a seven or eight year old child and that he would\n\n“like to really feel her breasts sometime,” referring to a teenage student but\n\ncomplained that her parents were always around. These comments, while\n\ncertainly extremely disturbing, do not appear to be admissions against\n\ndefendant’s interest to the extent they standing alone, prove no criminal act,\n\nand they are not correlated to the offenses or victims involved in this case.\n\nThe statements cannot relate to V.D., who did not know defendant during that\n\ntime period, nor do they appear to relate to L.S. Therefore, the statements\n\nbefore us are not equivalent to the statements at issue in State v. Edwards,\n\nCuyahoga App. No. 81351, 2003-Ohio-998, ¶27, where this court found\n\ndefendant’s statements to the victim’s sister     discussing whether he had\n\ntouched the victim’s breasts admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2).\n\n      {¶ 46} The state further alleges the comments were admissible pursuant\n\nto Evid.R. 404(B) as evidence of defendant’s common scheme or plan.\n\nHowever, Maryann did not testify that defendant had admitted to touching\n\fany of his students, but instead that he desired to do so.           While such\n\ncomments are reprehensible this does not make them admissible, particularly\n\nwhere Evid.R. 404(B) expressly precludes admission of defendant’s prior\n\nwrongs or acts to prove he acted in conformity therewith.\n\n      {¶ 47} In this case, however, any error in the admission of Maryann’s\n\ntestimony was harmless. Even disregarding Maryann’s testimony entirely,\n\nthere is overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt. State v. Davis (1975), 44\n\nOhio App.2d 335, 345, 338 N.E.2d 793.       Therefore, this assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n      {¶ 48} “IV: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, to present a defense, and to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel, in violation of the 6th and 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, in limiting the closing argument of the Defendant’s counsel.”\n\n      {¶ 49} Defendant suggests that the record reflects a clear limitation\n\nplaced on defense counsel’s final argument.           The record does reflect\n\nprompting by the trial court to summarize the argument and that the defense\n\nwas “getting close to your time.” Defense counsel did also say, “I wish I had a\n\nlot more time.” Notwithstanding, defense counsel never raised an objection\n\nbased on the alleged limitation of closing arguments.      A defendant who fails\n\nto object to the limitation of closing arguments waives his or her objection to\n\nsuch limitation for purposes of appeal. State v. Ferrette (1982), 18 Ohio St.3d\n\f106, 110, 480 N.E.2d 399. Further, “[t]he trial court in a criminal proceeding\n\nmay in its discretion limit the duration of closing arguments, as long as such\n\nlimitation is reasonable under the circumstances.” Id., citing, Weaver v. State\n\n(1874), 24 Ohio St. 584, paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n      {¶ 50} If there was a time limit placed on closing arguments, the\n\nduration of which is unknown from this record,2 it was reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances. We note while the court may have encouraged both sides\n\nduring their respective arguments to summarize, neither party objected and in\n\nevery instance, the speaker continued with argument. This assignment of\n\nerror is overruled.\n\n      {¶ 51} “V: The Trial Court erred in failing to properly impose post-release\n\ncontrols upon the Defendant at sentencing.”\n\n      {¶ 52} The state concedes that the trial court made no mention of the fact\n\nthat postrelease control could result in imposition of sanctions amounting to\n\none-half of the prison term originally imposed. Thus, this error is sustained.\n\nThis matter is remanded for resentencing for the proper imposition of\n\npostrelease control. State v. Fischer, 128 Ohio St.3d 92, 2010-Ohio-6238, 942\n\nN.E.2d 332;    State v. Singleton, 124 Ohio St.3d 173, 2009-Ohio-6434, 920\n\n\n      2\n       Comments made during the state’s closing argument indicate that any time\nlimitation exceeded thirty minutes, wherein the court stated, “to the prosecutor, I\njust want to also point out we’re at about a half-hour period.”\n\fN.E.2d 958, paragraph two of the syllabus (“[f]or criminal sentences imposed\n\non and after July 11, 2006, in which a trial court failed to properly impose\n\npostrelease control, trial courts shall apply the procedures set forth in R.C.\n\n2929.191.”);   see,   also,   State   v.   Harris,   Cuyahoga   App.   No.   95097,\n\n2011-Ohio-1072, ¶13 (remand appropriate where trial court did not advise of\n\nthe consequences of violating post-release control).\n\n      {¶ 53} “VI: The Trial Court erred to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, in sentencing Defendant to consecutive terms of imprisonment\n\nwithout making the findings required under Ohio R.C. §2929.14(E)(4).”\n\n      {¶ 54} Defendant argues that the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in Oregon v. Ice (2009), 555 U.S. 160, 129 S.Ct. 711, 172 L.Ed.2d 517,\n\neffectively overruled State v. Foster, 109 Ohio St.3d 1, 2006-Ohio-856, 845\n\nN.E.2d 470, and, therefore, re-instated the obligation to make certain\n\nstatutory findings before imposing consecutive sentences in Ohio. While this\n\nappeal was pending, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected this argument in State\n\nv. Hodge, 128 Ohio St.3d 1, 2010-Ohio-6320, 941 N.E.2d 768,             paragraph\n\nthree of the syllabus, (“[t]rial court judges are not obligated to engage in\n\njudicial fact-finding prior to imposing consecutive sentences unless the\n\fGeneral Assembly enacts new legislation requiring that findings be made.”)3\n\nAccordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.\n\n      Judgment affirmed and this matter is remanded for proper imposition of\n\npostrelease control.\n\n      It is ordered that appellee and appellant split the costs herein taxed.\n\n      The court finds there were reasonable grounds for this appeal.\n\n      It is ordered that a special mandate issue out of this court directing the\n\ncommon pleas court to carry this judgment into execution. The defendant’s\n\nconviction having been affirmed, any bail pending appeal is terminated. Case\n\nremanded to the trial court for execution of sentence.\n\n      A certified copy of this entry shall constitute the mandate pursuant to\n\nRule 27 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n\n\n\nJAMES J. SWEENEY, PRESIDING JUDGE\n\nKENNETH A. ROCCO, J., and\nEILEEN A. GALLAGHER, J., CONCUR\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       Defendant observes that those provisions were never changed or deleted in\nany of the post-Foster amendments to R.C. 2929.14. The Ohio Supreme Court took\nthis into account when it decided Hodge. Id., 2010-Ohio-6320, ¶6 (noting General\nAssembly is “no longer constrained by Foster’s holdings * * * and may, if it chooses to\ndo so, respond with enactment of a statutory provision in light of Ice’s holding.”)\n\f",

Mason, Esq.\nCuyahoga County Prosecutor\nBy: Sanjeev Bhasker, Esq.\nAssistant Prosecuting Attorney\nThe Justice Center\n1200 Ontario Street\nCleveland, Ohio 44113\n\n\n\n\nJAMES J. SWEENEY, P.J.:\n\n      {¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Joel Ferren, (“defendant”) appeals from his\n\nconvictions and sentences following a jury trial in which he was found guilty of\n\nfifty one counts of sexual battery, six counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a\n\nminor, and carrying a concealed weapon. The court imposed an aggregate\n\nsixteen year prison sentence.\n\n      {¶ 2} Defendant was a music teacher in Bedford, Ohio.             Two of his\n\nviolin students, L.S. and V.D., 1 independently made statements to police\n\nreporting various incidents that had occurred between each of them and\n\n      1\n          It is the policy of this Court not to identify victims of sexual offenses.\n\fdefendant during the course of their respective violin lessons with defendant.\n\nThe victims do not know each other.\n\n     {¶ 3} Defendant was born September 17, 1946.        L.S.’s date of birth is\n\nOctober 29, 1982 and V.D.’s date of birth is October 5, 1993.       L.S. began\n\nlessons with defendant around July of 1995, which ceased when she left for\n\ncollege in 2001. V.D. began her lessons with defendant in the fall of 2005,\n\nwhich continued until March of 2008. V.D. was the first to make a statement\n\nto police in March of 2008.    Thereafter L.S. learned of V.D.’s allegations\n\nagainst defendant from media coverage, which prompted L.S. to contact the\n\npolice and provide her statement.\n\n     {¶ 4} The grand jury returned a sixty-one count indictment, charging\n\ndefendant with multiple counts of sexual battery and unlawful sexual conduct\n\nwith a minor as well as a CCW count. Counts 1 through 53 identified the\n\nvictim as “Jane Doe #1” which was amended to be L.S. and counts 54 through\n\n60 identified “Jane Doe #2” which was later amended to be V.D.\n\n     {¶ 5} The first 53 counts of the indictment set forth the dates of offenses\n\nin monthly increments beginning with count 1 being “on or about August 1,\n\n1996 to August 31, 1996” and so forth, ending with count 53 being “on or about\n\nOctober 1, 2000 to October 28, 2000.” The sole exceptions being counts 11, 12,\n\n21, and 22; which broke June of 1997 into two separate counts (11 and 12) and\n\nalso broke March of 1998 into two separate counts (21 and 22). Prior to trial,\n\fcount 11 was amended to include all of June 1997 and count 21 was amended\n\nto include all of March 1998. Counts 12 and 22 were then dismissed.\n\n      {¶ 6} Also prior to trial, counts 55 through 60 were amended to reflect\n\nthe dates of offense as October 1, 2007 through March 17, 2008 and count 54\n\nwas dismissed.\n\n      {¶ 7} The defense filed a motion to sever the counts involving L.S. from\n\nthose involving V.D. and sought an order for separate trials.       The state\n\nopposed the motion.\n\n      {¶ 8} The state filed a bill of particulars on November 13, 2009 and\n\ndefendant moved for a more specific bill of particulars on November 30, 2009.\n\n      {¶ 9} By order dated December 22, 2009, the trial court issued a journal\n\nentry granting defendant’s motion for a more particular bill of particulars and\n\ndenied his motion to sever counts. The state provided a supplemental bill of\n\nparticulars on February 25, 2010.\n\n      {¶ 10} At trial, V.D. testified that she began violin lessons with\n\ndefendant in the fall of 2005 when she was 12 years old. The lessons took\n\nplace at defendant’s studio in Bedford, Ohio. V.D. was home schooled and\n\ntook lessons on Friday mornings for one hour. V.D.’s family developed a close\n\nrelationship with defendant and defendant often ate dinner with them.\n\nDefendant told them he was 35 years old and a French baron. The family\n\nbelieved he owned a chateau in France and was the heir of a French duchess.\n\fHe told them he had a private jet and spent every weekend in France teaching\n\nmusic lessons. Defendant gave the family gifts and they celebrated birthdays\n\ntogether. In the summer of 2007, V.D. told her mother that defendant had\n\nkissed her neck. V.D.’s mother found this totally inappropriate and contacted\n\ndefendant. V.D.’s mother demanded that he never do that again.\n\n      {¶ 11} V.D. continued her violin lessons with defendant in 2007.    At that\n\ntime, V.D. began an apprenticeship with defendant in order to learn how to\n\nmake violins. The apprenticeship took place Mondays through Fridays. The\n\nhours varied but V.D. typically returned home between 10 and 11 p.m.\n\n      {¶ 12} V.D.     testified   that   approximately   two   weeks   into   the\n\napprenticeship defendant began kissing and fondling her.         Eventually this\n\nlead to V.D. engaging in sexual intercourse with defendant by the end of\n\nOctober 2007.       According to V.D. from that point until March 17, 2008, she\n\nengaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex with defendant on an average of\n\nthree times a week. Usually the incidents took place on the air mattress in\n\nthe studio’s back room; however, occasionally they would take place in the\n\nfront room. Defendant gave V.D. a lavender nightgown that was kept at the\n\nstudio and which she identified as State’s Exhibit 5. Although she wore it on\n\noccasion, V.D. said that she usually did not have time to put it on.     V.D. said\n\nshe felt guilty and told defendant she wanted to stop. However, they continued\n\nto engage in sexual relations until her parents were told about the\n\frelationship in March of 2008. During this time period, V.D. was 14 years\n\nold.\n\n       {¶ 13} V.D. gave a statement to police on March 21, 2008.    Det. Klubnik\n\nobtained a search warrant and seized various items from defendant’s music\n\nstudio, including the lavender lingerie, men’s pajamas, lotions, bedding, and\n\nKleenex. Forensic scientists of Ohio’s Bureau of Criminal Identification and\n\nInvestigation (“BCI”) testified concerning tests conducted on some of these\n\nitems. Later, V.D. made a list of all the outfits she remembered wearing on\n\ndays that she engaged in sexual conduct with the defendant. She recalled\n\nthat he like certain outfits and she wore certain outfits to please him.\n\n       {¶ 14} No semen was found on the men’s pajama pants or the lingerie.\n\nDNA testing indicated the presence of mixed DNA profile on the lavender\n\nlingerie, with the major contributor being consistent with V.D.’s DNA profile\n\nand the minor contributor being consistent with defendant’s DNA profile.\n\n       {¶ 15} The state also presented the testimony of a woman, Maryann, who\n\nclaimed to be acquainted with defendant.       Maryann testified that she met\n\ndefendant in March of 1995 and the two were intimate for a brief period of\n\ntime. She claimed that defendant made certain comments to her about his\n\nstudents, including that he would like to get into the pants of a seven or eight\n\nyear old student but her parents were always present.            Defendant also\n\nallegedly commented to Maryann that he would really like to feel the breasts\n\fof another student who was 13 or 14 years old. Although Maryann said she\n\nfound these comments extremely inappropriate and felt very uncomfortable\n\nabout them, she never reported them to anyone.        Further, she initiated\n\ncontact with defendant in 2005 and “reconnected” with him. Maryann also\n\nasked for defendant’s help with one of her own students. When she learned of\n\nthis case through the media, Maryann contacted the police.\n\n     {¶ 16} On cross-examination, defense counsel solicited further comments\n\nfrom Maryann to the effect that defendant said he could not wait until the\n\nstudents turned eighteen. All of the alleged comments were made between\n\n1995 and 1997.\n\n     {¶ 17} L.S. testified that she met defendant in 1995 when she was in the\n\nseventh grade. L.S. kept a diary that included entries between January 28,\n\n1995 to August 1, 1996. L.S. took weekly lessons from defendant and by May\n\nof 1996, defendant was telling her that he loved her.        On July 4, 1996,\n\ndefendant proposed marriage to L.S. with an emerald ring. L.S. believed she\n\nwas engaged to defendant at this point. She was 13 years old. Defendant\n\ntold her not to tell her parents. Later that month, L.S. was in Europe with\n\nher cousins on a school trip and told them about her engagement to defendant.\n\nThe cousins, in turn, told her parents about it. L.S.’s mother and father both\n\ntestified that they were flabbergasted and shocked by this information. They\n\ncontacted defendant who came to their house.        They both recalled that\n\fdefendant expected the police to be there when he arrived. He apologized and\n\nsaid he had never done anything like that before. Defendant told them he\n\nwas 27 years old. L.S.’s parents terminated her violin lessons.\n\n        {¶ 18} L.S. said she became very upset by her parent’s decision because\n\nshe was in love with the defendant.        She pouted around the house and\n\neventually her parents accepted defendant’s offer to continue the violin\n\ninstructions at their home for free. L.S. said she resumed her lessons at her\n\nhome in Maple Heights in August of 1996. While L.S.’s parents were always\n\nhome when defendant was there, her parents would not be in the room with\n\nthem.\n\n        {¶ 19} Defendant would tell L.S. to wear certain clothes.      On one\n\noccasion she was wearing a red kilt skirt and defendant started kissing and\n\nhugging her.     A sexual relationship developed between them in August of\n\n1996, which included oral sex between them. This occurred at least once in\n\nAugust 1996, and continued at least once a month until she left for college.\n\nL.S. said the incidents occurred in her living room and also in her basement.\n\nL.S. believed that the defendant was about 27 years old. L.S. turned 18 years\n\nold in October of 2000 and defendant was not charged with any offenses\n\nagainst L.S. after that date.\n\f      {¶ 20} The state presented additional witnesses and defendant called\n\nseveral witnesses, whose testimony will be discussed to the extent necessary\n\nto address the issues on appeal.\n\n      {¶ 21} “I: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law and against double jeopardy, in violation of the 5th and 14th\n\nAmendment to the United States Constitution, in denying Defendant’s motion\n\nto dismiss the indictment and allowing Defendant to be tried under a\n\n‘carbon-copy’ indictment which failed to allege particularity in the allegations\n\nagainst Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 22} Defendant maintains that he was deprived of due process with\n\nrespect to the lack of specificity in the indictment and bill of particulars. In\n\nthis case, defendant was charged with engaging in multiple counts of sexual\n\nbattery involving L.S. Each count pertained to a separate month in a specific\n\nyear. Defendant asserts that the counts pertaining to V.D. did not, however,\n\nspecify a similar discrete time period because all counts identified the time\n\nperiod as on or about September 15, 2007 to March 17, 2008.\n\n      {¶ 23} The state indicated in the bill of particulars and supplemental bill\n\nof particulars that: (a) counts 1-51 took place at a specific residence in Maple\n\nHeights and occurred either on the first floor living room or the downstairs\n\nbasement; (b) counts 52-53 occurred at defendant’s Bedford studio; (c) that\n\ncounts 1-53 involved oral sex, physically intimate touching and fondling,\n\fsexual conduct and sexual contact but not vaginal intercourse; (d) that the\n\nvictim in counts 1-53 was a minor at the time of the incidents; (e) counts 54-60\n\ntook place at defendant’s music studio and involved oral sex, physical intimate\n\ntouching and fondling, sexual conduct and sexual contact, including vaginal\n\nintercourse; (f) the victim in counts 54-60 was a minor at the time of the\n\nincidents.\n\n      {¶ 24} Defendant maintains that the carbon-copy indictment deprived\n\nhim of due process rights, including the notice aspect, which he believes was\n\nnot cured by differentiation at trial. Defendant primarily relies on Russell\n\nv.

Russell, 369 U.S. at 763-764.\n\n      {¶ 26} The distinct due process components involved in examining the\n\nsufficiency of an indictment include notice and double jeopardy. The vast\n\nmajority of cases from our district that have applied Valentine have been\n\nresolved under a double jeopardy analysis. E.g., State v.

Hemphill, Cuyahoga App. No. 85431, 2005-Ohio-3726.            With the\n\nexception of this Court’s decision in Holder, this Court has addressed the\n\nnotice aspect of due process in terms of a carbon copy indictment and rejected\n\nit. See State v. Thomas, Cuyahoga App. No. 94492, 2011-Ohio-705, ¶22 (“in\n\ncases involving sexual offenses against children, indictments need not state\n\nwith specificity the dates of alleged abuse, so long as the prosecution\n\nestablishes that the offense was committed within the time frame alleged.”);\n\nState v. Wilson, Cuyahoga App. No. 92148, 2010-Ohio-550, appeal not allowed,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2010-Ohio-2510, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n      {¶ 27} The Sixth Circuit in Valentine expressly rejected the notion that a\n\nlack of specificity as to dates and times in an indictment alleging child abuse\n\nviolated the notice requirements of due process. Valentine, 395 F.3d at 632.\n\nThe Court held, “[c]ertainly, prosecutors should be as specific as possible in\n\ndelineating the dates and times of abuse offenses, but we must acknowledge\n\nthe reality of situations where young child victims are involved. The Ohio\n\nCourt of Appeals found that there was no evidence the state had more specific\n\ninformation regarding the time period of the abuse. Valentine’s claims\n\nregarding the lack of time-and date-specific counts therefore fail.” Id.\n\f      {¶ 28} Defendant’s argument, which is premised on the date range of the\n\nindictment, is not sufficient to establish a deprivation of his due process\n\nrights. The state provided defendant with the information it had regarding\n\nthe time period of the abuse and both victims testified consistently with that\n\ninformation.   There is no evidence that the state had any more specific\n\ninformation regarding the time period of abuse than it had provided to\n\ndefendant.\n\n      {¶ 29} To the extent defendant maintains that the state failed to\n\ndifferentiate among the various counts, we disagree.      The state provided\n\ndefendant with notice prior to trial of the types of sexual conduct and contact\n\ninvolved with each victim. The victims testified with specificity, recalling at\n\ntimes, details of what they were wearing when various incidents occurred.\n\nThe reality of the victims’ testimony is that with each girl, defendant engaged\n\nin an on-going course of conduct over an extended period of time, rendering\n\nthem unable to pinpoint exact dates. The girls could not delineate each and\n\nevery sexual episode they had with the defendant, however, their testimony\n\nwas specific and established the counts of the indictment. L.S. was certain\n\ndefendant had engaged in oral sex with her, among other things, at least once\n\na month beginning in August of 1996 until October of 2000 at which time she\n\nturned eighteen.    Although she testified that the relationship continued\n\nthereafter, defendant was not charged with any crimes after she reached the\n\fage of majority. V.D. likewise testified that defendant engaged in sexual\n\nintercourse with her beginning in October of 2007, which continued on average\n\nthree times a week until March 17, 2008.\n\n      {¶ 30} In Holder, the court determined,\n\n      {¶ 31} “The State indicted Holder with five carbon copy rape counts, five\n\ncarbon copy gross sexual imposition counts, and two carbon copy sexual\n\nbattery counts. Holder timely raised his objection pursuant to Crim.R. 12(C).\n\nHowever, the prosecutor failed to respond with an amendment to the\n\nindictment or a supplemental bill of particulars to differentiate these counts\n\nfrom one another ‘such that a court in a second trial would be able to discern\n\nwhether there had been a previous finding of not guilty as to the alleged act.’\n\nTherefore, we find that the indictment was insufficient and the trial court did\n\nnot err in granting, in part, Holder’s motion to dismiss.” Holder,\n\n2008-Ohio-1271, ¶11.\n\n      {¶ 32} The state provided defendant with more specifics of the charges\n\nagainst defendant by way of a supplemental bill of particulars. Defendant\n\nwas apprised of the location of the incidents, the type of sexual activity\n\ninvolved, and the fact of the victim’s minority. This case is distinguishable\n\nfrom Holder where this court upheld the trial court’s partial dismissal of\n\ncertain counts of a carbon copy indictment when the state failed to provide any\n\nspecificity beyond what was contained in the indictment.\n\f      {¶ 33} “II: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, in failing to sever the charges against Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 34} Because defendant did not renew his objection to joinder at the\n\nclose of evidence, he has waived all but plain error. State v. Hill, Cuyahoga\n\nApp. No. 95379, 2011-Ohio-2523, ¶9.\n\n      {¶ 35} Pursuant to Crim.R. 8(A):\n\n      {¶ 36} “Two or more offenses may be charged in the same indictment,\n\ninformation or complaint in a separate count for each offense if the offenses\n\ncharged, whether felonies or misdemeanors or both, are of the same or similar\n\ncharacter, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are based on two or\n\nmore acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a\n\ncommon scheme or plan, or are part of a course of criminal conduct.”\n\n      {¶ 37} A defendant may seek severance of counts but bears the burden of\n\nproving prejudice. Hill, 2011-Ohio-2523, ¶13, citing, Crim.R. 14.\n\n      {¶ 38} The state can counter a claim of prejudice in two ways: (1) the\n\n“other acts” test, which compels an Evid.R. 404(B) analysis; or (2) the “joinder\n\ntest” where the state must merely show that the evidence of each crime is\n\nsimple and direct. State v. Franklin (1991), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 122, N.E.2d;\n\nsee, also, State v. Kirk, Cuyahoga App. No. 95261, 2011-Ohio-687, ¶40. “[I]f\n\nthe state can meet the joinder test, it need not meet the stricter ‘other acts’\n\ftest of Evid.R. 404(B).” State v. Mills (1992), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">582</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n      {¶ 39} Despite defendant’s position to the contrary, we find that the\n\nevidence in this case satisfied the joinder test. The test does not depend on\n\nthe amount of evidence presented as to the joined offenses but instead whether\n\nthe jury was able to segregate the proof required for each of them.\n\n      {¶ 40} A trial court does not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for\n\nseverance of trials when the state presents evidence that is direct,\n\nuncomplicated, and the jury demonstrates its ability to segregate the proof on\n\neach charge. State v. Brooks (1989), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\nThe record presents clear and direct evidence as to each separate victim such\n\nthat the jury was readily able to segregate the proof on each charge.\n\n      {¶ 41} This assignment of error is overruled.\n\n      {¶ 42} “III: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, in violation of the 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution in permitting testimony of ‘other acts’ of the Defendant.”\n\n      {¶ 43} Evid.R. 404(B) provides “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or\n\nacts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show\n\naction in conformity therewith.     It may, however, be admissible for other\n\npurposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\n\nknowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”\n\f      {¶ 44} Under this assignment of error, defendant challenges the\n\nadmission of Maryann’s testimony concerning certain comments defendant\n\nallegedly made about some unidentified minor students sometime between\n\n1995 and 1997. The state first counters that these statements were properly\n\nadmitted as admissions pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2).\n\n      {¶ 45} Maryann alleged that defendant told her that he “would like to get\n\ninto her pants,” referring to a seven or eight year old child and that he would\n\n“like to really feel her breasts sometime,” referring to a teenage student but\n\ncomplained that her parents were always around. These comments, while\n\ncertainly extremely disturbing, do not appear to be admissions against\n\ndefendant’s interest to the extent they standing alone, prove no criminal act,\n\nand they are not correlated to the offenses or victims involved in this case.\n\nThe statements cannot relate to V.D., who did not know defendant during that\n\ntime period, nor do they appear to relate to L.S. Therefore, the statements\n\nbefore us are not equivalent to the statements at issue in State v. Edwards,\n\nCuyahoga App. No. 81351, 2003-Ohio-998, ¶27, where this court found\n\ndefendant’s statements to the victim’s sister     discussing whether he had\n\ntouched the victim’s breasts admissible pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2).\n\n      {¶ 46} The state further alleges the comments were admissible pursuant\n\nto Evid.R. 404(B) as evidence of defendant’s common scheme or plan.\n\nHowever, Maryann did not testify that defendant had admitted to touching\n\fany of his students, but instead that he desired to do so.           While such\n\ncomments are reprehensible this does not make them admissible, particularly\n\nwhere Evid.R. 404(B) expressly precludes admission of defendant’s prior\n\nwrongs or acts to prove he acted in conformity therewith.\n\n      {¶ 47} In this case, however, any error in the admission of Maryann’s\n\ntestimony was harmless. Even disregarding Maryann’s testimony entirely,\n\nthere is overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt. State v. Davis (1975), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3743094\"><a href=\"/opinion/3990203/state-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 345, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3743094\"><a href=\"/opinion/3990203/state-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.       Therefore, this assignment of error\n\nis overruled.\n\n      {¶ 48} “IV: The trial court erred, to the prejudice of Defendant’s rights to\n\ndue process of law, to present a defense, and to the effective assistance of\n\ncounsel, in violation of the 6th and 14th Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, in limiting the closing argument of the Defendant’s counsel.”\n\n      {¶ 49} Defendant suggests that the record reflects a clear limitation\n\nplaced on defense counsel’s final argument.           The record does reflect\n\nprompting by the trial court to summarize the argument and that the defense\n\nwas “getting close to your time.” Defense counsel did also say, “I wish I had a\n\nlot more time.” Notwithstanding, defense counsel never raised an objection\n\nbased on the alleged limitation of closing arguments.      A defendant who fails\n\nto object to the limitation of closing arguments waives his or her objection to\n\nsuch limitation for purposes of appeal. State v. Ferrette (1982), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span>\n\f<span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Further, “[t]he trial court in a criminal proceeding\n\nmay in its discretion limit the duration of closing arguments, as long as such\n\nlimitation is reasonable under the circumstances.” Id., citing, Weaver v. State\n\n(1874), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">584</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, paragraph one of the syllabus.\n\n      {¶ 50} If there was a time limit placed on closing arguments, the\n\nduration of which is unknown from this record,2 it was reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances. We note while the court may have encouraged both sides\n\nduring their respective arguments to summarize, neither party objected and in\n\nevery instance, the speaker continued with argument. This assignment of\n\nerror is overruled.\n\n      {¶ 51} “V: The Trial Court erred in failing to properly impose post-release\n\ncontrols upon the Defendant at sentencing.”\n\n      {¶ 52} The state concedes that the trial court made no mention of the fact\n\nthat postrelease control could result in imposition of sanctions amounting to\n\none-half of the prison term originally imposed. Thus, this error is sustained.\n\nThis matter is remanded for resentencing for the proper imposition of\n\npostrelease control. State v. Fischer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2010-Ohio-6238, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">;    State v.
