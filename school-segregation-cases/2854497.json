Maram, the current director of the Illinois Department of\nPublic Aid, is substituted as the defendant in lieu of the named\ndefendant, Jackie Garner. Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\f2                                                No. 02-3657\n\nRadaszewski requires around-the-clock medical care in\norder to survive. Until he reached the age of 21, the Illinois\nDepartment of Public Aid (“IDPA” or the “Department”)\nprovided funding through a Medicaid program for children\nthat enabled Eric to receive 16 hours of private-duty nurs-\ning at home each day. After he turned 21, Eric was no\nlonger eligible to participate in that program. Illinois has a\nseparate program providing at-home care for adults who\nwould otherwise have to be cared for in institutions. How-\never, funding under that program is capped at a level that\nis insufficient to pay for the extent of private-duty nursing\nthat Eric would need in order to remain at home. Conse-\nquently, Eric faces the prospect of entering a long-term care\nfacility in order to receive the intensive medical care that he\nneeds. Eric’s mother, Donna Radaszewski, filed this suit\nagainst the Director of the IDPA (the “Director”) on Eric’s\nbehalf, contending that the IDPA’s failure to fully fund at-\nhome, private-duty nursing for Eric amounts to disability\ndiscrimination in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the “Rehabilitation Act”),\nand Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n42 U.S.C. § 12132 (the “ADA”), in that Illinois is refusing to\nprovide the medical services that Eric requires in order to\nremain in the most community-integrated setting appropri-\nate for his needs, which is his home. The district court\nentered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Director,\nreasoning that the ADA claim against the Director was\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that the Rehabili-\ntation Act claim failed as a matter of law because in-home\nnursing care is not a service that Illinois currently provides\nto any adult individual. We reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n\n                              I.\n  As this case was resolved on the basis of the pleadings, we\naccept the facts alleged in Radaszewski’s supplemental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                  3\n\ncomplaint as true. E.g., Midwest Gas Servs., Inc. v. Indiana\nGas Co., 317 F.3d 703, 709 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct.\n82 (2003). We also take judicial notice of the contents of\ncertain matters in the public record, including administra-\ntive findings about Eric’s medical status and needs. See,\ne.g., Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin v. Thompson, 161\nF.3d 449, 456 (7th Cir. 1998).\n  Eric was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a form of brain\ncancer, in 1992. After undergoing surgery, radiation, and\nchemotherapy to treat the cancer, Eric suffered a mid-brain\nstroke in 1993. The cancer, stroke, and medical treatment\nhave impaired Eric’s physical and mental functions and left\nhim medically fragile. In the opinion of his physician, Eric\nrequires one-on-one care by a registered nurse 24 hours per\nday in order to survive.\n  Since July 1994, Eric has received around-the-clock care\nat his parents’ home. In August 1995, when his family had\nexhausted its medical insurance benefits, Eric began to\nreceive at-home nursing care through the Illinois Medicaid\nprogram.\n  Medicaid, a program funded jointly by the States and the\nfederal government, provides medical assistance both to dis-\nabled individuals and to families with dependent children\nwhose income and resources are otherwise insufficient to\npay for the cost of the medical care that they require. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396; 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1. Each State\nparticipating in the Medicaid program must submit for\napproval to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human\nServices (“HHS”) a plan setting forth the services that the\nState will provide in its Medicaid program. 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1396, 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a), 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(a).\n  “Private-duty nursing,” defined as nursing services pro-\nvided to a person who requires more individualized and\ncontinuous care than would routinely be provided by a\nvisiting nurse or by the nursing staff of a hospital or skilled\n\f4                                                No. 02-3657\n\nnursing facility, 42 C.F.R. § 440.80, is one of the services\nthat a State may elect to include in its Medicaid plan. 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 440.225.\nA State may choose to provide private-duty nursing services\nat the recipient’s home, at a hospital, or at a skilled nursing\nfacility. 42 C.F.R. § 440.80(c). Prior to this litigation, the\nIllinois Medicaid plan included coverage for private-duty\nnursing, provided that such nursing was recommended by\na physician, prior approval was obtained from the appropri-\nate State agency, and the care was provided by someone\nother than the recipient’s relative; the plan imposed no\nlimitation on the cost of such care, nor did it limit where\nprivate-duty nursing could be provided to the Medicaid\nrecipient. See Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Garner, 805\nN.E.2d 620, 623-24 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003), supplemented on\ndenial of reh’g (March 25, 2004). In the course of this litiga-\ntion, however, Illinois drafted an amendment to its\nMedicaid plan to delete all references to private-duty\nnursing and submitted the amendment to HHS for clear-\nance; the Secretary approved that amendment on February\n2, 2001. Id. at 622-23; Radaszewski Reply Br. Addendum\n12-13. The State then initiated rulemaking under the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act to implement the\nchange; that process was completed as of September 1,\n2001. See Radaszewski, 805 N.E.2d at 622-23.\n  In addition to the services outlined in their basic Medicaid\nplans, States may seek HHS approval to provide home and\ncommunity-based services to individuals who would other-\nwise require institutional care. The HHS Secretary may\napprove these services in the exercise of his “waiver” au-\nthority, so labeled because it empowers the Secretary to\nwaive certain Medicaid requirements that would otherwise\nconstrain a State’s ability to offer these services—e.g.,\nservice limitations and financial eligibility criteria. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396n(b)-(h); 42 C.F.R. § 430.25(d). This power is\noften used to authorize innovative and experimental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                     5\n\nprograms. As relevant here, it facilitates state programs\ndesigned to provide home- and community-based services to\npersons who would otherwise have to be cared for in nursing\nhomes or other institutions: specifically, the Secretary may\nissue waivers permitting a State to offer these services only\nto individuals who need them in order to avoid\ninstitutionalization, rather than to every State citizen who\nqualifies for Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1). In seeking\napproval for a waiver program offering home and commu-\nnity care, however, the State must certify that it is cost-\nneutral in the sense that the average per-person cost of the\ncare offered through the waiver program does not exceed\nthe average cost of providing that care in an institutional\nsetting. See § 1396n(c)(2)(D); 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e).\n   Pursuant to this waiver authority, HHS has approved\nIllinois’s Medicaid program for Medically Fragile, Technology\nDependent Children (the “MFTDC program”). This program\noffers a variety of home- and community-based services and\nequipment to medically fragile persons under the age of 21\nwho would otherwise have to be cared for in a skilled\npediatric facility or a hospital. See 89 Ill. Admin. Code §\n140.645. The services offered by this program include\nprivate-duty shift nursing and respite care in the recipient’s\nhome. The amount of services that a person may receive\nunder this program is determined with reference to the cost\nof the care that he or she alternatively would require in a\nskilled pediatric facility or a hospital. 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§ 140.645(c)(3).1\n\n\n1\n  The Director points out that Congress has required each State\nto provide comprehensive medical screening, diagnostic, and\ntreatment to persons under the age of 21, even if such care\ninvolves services not otherwise covered under the State’s basic\nMedicaid plan. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r); see also\n305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-19(a) (outlining Illinois’s Healthy\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f6                                                 No. 02-3657\n\n  Eric was found eligible for the MFTDC program and be-\ngan receiving services in 1995. Based on the estimated cost\nof the level of care that Eric would require in a medical\ninstitution, the IDPA approved a care plan for Eric that\ncalled for 16 hours per day of in-home nursing services\nprovided by registered nurses. Eric’s parents, who were\ngiven special training so that they could provide the nec-\nessary care for Eric, tended to him the remaining eight\nhours of each day. In order to provide them with periodic\nrelief from that responsibility, the IDPA also provided Eric\nan additional 336 hours of respite nursing services per year.\nThe IDPA approved this care plan annually until Eric\nreached the age of 21 when, by virtue of his age, he became\nineligible for continued participation in the MFTDC\nprogram.\n  Illinois has a separate HHS-approved waiver program for\ndisabled adults—the Home Services Program (“HSP”)—\nwhich, like the MFTDC program, offers services not other-\nwise covered by the State’s basic Medicaid program and\nwhich enables such adults to continue living at home in lieu\nof being cared for in an institution, provided that the cost of\nat-home care does not exceed the cost of institutional care.\nSee 89 Ill. Admin. Code §§ 676.10(a), 676.30(j), 682.100.\nHowever, the services provided pursuant to the HSP are\nlimited by a Service Cost Maximum (“SCM”) established by\nthe IDPA. 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 679.50(a). The SCM is\ndetermined with reference to what it would cost to provide\nnursing care to the recipient in an institutional setting, e.g.,\na hospital or a nursing facility. See id.; see also 42 C.F.R. §\n441.302(c). Based on his degree of impairment and his need\nfor medical care, an individual who seeks to participate in\n\n\n1\n  (...continued)\nKids Program). By virtue of that mandate, States may in practice\noffer more Medicaid services to persons under the age of 21 than\nthey do to adults.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                          7\n\nthe HSP is assigned a Determination of Need (“DON”) score\nreflecting his risk of institutionalization. See 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode §§ 676.30(d), 679.10-679.50. Eric received a DON score\nof 70, and at that time, the standard SCM for an individual\nwith that DON score was $1,857.00 per month. See 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code § 679.50 (b) (setting forth current SCMs for\nparticipants in HSP). A higher “exceptional care rate” may\nbe approved for an individual with a “complex medical\ndiagnosis.” See 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5.8a; 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code § 140.569(a); In re Appeal of Eric\nRadaszewski, Appeal No. 00-019688-HSP, Findings of Fact\nof the Hearing Officer ¶ F (IDPA Aug. 18, 2000) (hereinafter,\n“IDPA Hearing Officer Findings”).2 A counselor with the\nIDPA’s Office of Rehabilitation Service (“ORS”), after\nreviewing Eric’s situation, requested and obtained approval\nof an exceptional care rate for Eric in the amount of $4,593\nper month. However, in the assessment of Eric’s physician,\nthat amount would only be sufficient to cover four to five\nhours per day of at-home nursing services for Eric. The\nestimated cost of maintaining Eric’s at-home care 24 hours\nper day3 is between $15,000 and $20,000 per month.\n\n\n2\n   The exceptional care rate corresponds to what the IDPA would\npay a skilled nursing facility to provide “exceptional medical care” to\nthe individual. See 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5.8a; 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode § 140.569(a)(1). “Exceptional medical care” is defined as “the\nlevel of medical care required by persons who are medically stable for\ndischarge from a hospital but who require acute intensity hospital\nlevel care for physician, nurse, and ancillary specialist services .\n. . .” 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1.1(i); see also 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode § 140.569(a)(2). Persons eligible for such care, and for\nreimbursement at the exceptional care rate, include (but are not\nlimited to) individuals with head injuries, ventilator-dependent\npersons, and persons with HIV/AIDS. Id.\n3\n  Although Eric’s parents historically have provided eight hours\nof care to Eric each day, the record indicates that they are now\nseeking to have the State fund 24-hour-per-day care to Eric, as the\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f8                                                   No. 02-3657\n\nHowever, the ORS contended that it was not authorized to\npay for at-home medical care in excess of what it would cost\nto provide exceptional care for Eric at a skilled nursing\nfacility. The IDPA took the position that if funding at the\nexceptional care rate was insufficient to provide for Eric’s\ncare at home, then he would to have to move to an institu-\ntional setting in order to receive care. It determined that\nEric could be adequately cared for in a nursing home\nfacility.\n  Eric filed an administrative grievance with the IDPA,\ncontending that the Department should be required to pay\nmore than the exceptional care rate so that he could con-\ntinue receiving the care he requires at home rather than in\na nursing home. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing\nconducted in July 2000, a hearing officer made a number of\nfactual determinations, including the following findings as\nto the level of care that Eric requires:\n    H. The uncontradicted evidence submitted by Grievant\n    [Eric] is that the Grievant would be at risk of danger if\n    he should be placed in a nursing home. Grievant’s\n    doctor testified that Grievant needs substantial one on\n    one nursing care to survive. He is medically fragile, prone\n    to infections, immobilized, catheterized and relies on\n    oxygen. A registered nurse is required to look for prob-\n    lems before they become “full blown and he crashes,”\n    according to Grievant’s doctor. His immunological re-\n    sponses were severely compromised due to earlier radi-\n    ation and chemotherapy, so skilled nursing care is a\n\n\n3\n   (...continued)\nstate of their own health has diminished their ability to care for\nEric themselves. Eric’s father has suffered a stroke and can no\nlonger drive or help move Eric. Eric’s mother was diagnosed with\na brain tumor, and as a result of the tumor and the treatment for\nit, she cannot tolerate heat and suffers from dizzy spells. IDPA\nHearing Officer Findings ¶ G.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                               9\n\n   “question of survival, not a question of doing well.” The\n   physician strongly urged that Grievant be given the\n   funds to support 24 hours per day of skilled nursing\n   care. Placing Grievant in a nursing home facility of the\n   type suggested by the State, according to the physician,\n   would result in Grievant being seriously medically com-\n   promised, which would lead to many hospitalizations.\n   I. Grievant’s physician’s opinion was supported by the\n   registered nurse in charge of Grievant’s care. He\n   described Grievant’s medical needs in detail. Grievant\n   has no sense of thirst, so his hydration must be care-\n   fully monitored in order to avoid serious medical com-\n   plications. Although Grievant has difficulty swallowing,\n   he can be given soft food, but only under careful condi-\n   tions. His nutrition must be carefully monitored.\n   Grievant cannot protect his airway by turning his head;\n   any aspiration of food, liquid or medicine can become a\n   medical emergency. Chronic sinus infections lead to\n   sepsis, which can be rapid and acute. Grievant also has\n   osteoporosis and is in danger of breaking bones. His\n   risk of injury is high because he sometimes forgets he\n   cannot walk. His short-term memory is not good and he\n   is often confused. He also has difficulty with urination\n   and elimination, which if left untreated, can result in\n   medical emergencies. Grievant has to be under constant\n   surveillance.\n   J. According to the expert witness offered by Grievant,\n   Grievant could not get the level of required nursing care\n   in a nursing home facility, including the facility sug-\n   gested by the State (Alden Lincoln Park Nursing\n   Facility). In her assessment for this hearing, the expert\n   contacted several nursing homes (including Alden) and\n   asked about the level of care provided. According to this\n   witness, none would provide the level of care need by\n   Grievant: 24 hour[s] per day by skilled clinical nurses.\n   She based her assessment on the Grievant’s medical\n\f10                                               No. 02-3657\n\n     file, her observation of Grievant, and her 20 years of\n     experience as a skilled nursing professional.\nIDPA Hearing Officer Findings ¶¶ H-J. Presented with the\nhearing officer’s factual findings and Eric’s grievance, IDPA\nDirector Ann Patla concluded that the sole issue that she\nhad the authority to resolve was whether the IDPA’s own\nrules permit the HSP to pay for an individual’s medical care\nat a level greater than the exceptional care rate. She\nconcluded that they do not. In a decision issued in August\n18, 2000, she stated: “I find that the Rules set forth do not\nallow the HSP program to pay greater than the SCM at the\nexceptional care rate in any case.” In re Appeal of Eric\nRadaszewski, Appeal No. 00-019688-HSP, Final Adminis-\ntrative Decision (IDPA Aug. 18, 2000).\n  On September 1, 2000, Radaszewski filed a complaint for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the IDPA director\nin federal court, asserting that a reduction in the level of\nprivate-duty nursing provided to her son at home would\nconstitute a violation of the federal Medicaid statute as well\nas a deprivation of due process in violation of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. She sought and obtained a temporary\nrestraining order obligating the IDPA to continue funding\nEric’s at-home care. However, the district court subse-\nquently denied Radaszewski’s request for a preliminary\ninjunction, concluding that Radaszewski’s complaint alleged\nno viable federal claim and that the court consequently\nlacked authority to award her preliminary injunctive relief.\nRadaszewski v. Patla, No. 00 C 5931, Order (N.D. Ill. Nov.\n7, 2000). Radaszewski appealed the preliminary injunction\nruling to this court. While that appeal was pending, HHS on\nFebruary 2, 2001, approved the amendment to Illinois’ basic\nMedicaid plan eliminating private-duty nursing as a service\nprovided under that plan. Both parties agreed that the\namendment rendered Radaszewski’s lawsuit moot. On that\nbasis, we dismissed her appeal in an unpublished order.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                11\n\nRadaszewski v. Patla, No. 00-3929, 2 Fed. Appx. 565, 2001\nWL 242169 (7th Cir. March 8, 2001) (unpublished) (text\navailable in Westlaw).\n   Meanwhile, in December 2000, after the district court had\ndenied her motion for a preliminary injunction, Radaszewski\nfiled suit against the IDPA Director in Illinois court—\nseeking injunctive relief compelling the IDPA to fully fund\nthe cost of the private-duty nursing care that Eric required\nin order to remain at home. Each of the theories that\nRadaszewski asserted in support of this relief was premised\non state law. The state court entered a temporary injunc-\ntion requiring the IDPA to restore funding to the\nRadaszewski family sufficient to pay for 16 hours of private-\nduty nursing per day. That injunction, we are told, remains\nin effect today. Nearly one year later, the state court\ngranted Radaszewski leave to file a supplemental complaint\nwhich added, inter alia, claims under Title II of the ADA, 42\nU.S.C. § 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n29 U.S.C. § 794. Radaszewski contended that the IDPA’s\nrefusal to pay for full-time private-duty nursing for Eric at\nhis home was inconsistent with the State’s duty, pursuant\nto regulations promulgated under both the ADA and Rehabil-\nitation Act, to provide care for a disabled person in the most\ncommunity-integrated setting appropriate for that person.\nBased on the newly alleged violations of federal law, the\nDirector removed the action to federal court. Radaszewski\nasked the district court to remand the case to state court.\nThe district court remanded the state-law claims alone,\nreasoning that it lacked supplemental jurisdiction over\nthose claims under Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S. Ct. 900 (1984).\nRadaszewski v. Garner, No. 01 C 9551, 2002 WL 31430325,\nat *6 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 21, 2002). The state circuit court\nsubsequently granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of\nthe Director. However, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed\nthat judgment and remanded for further proceedings,\n\f12                                               No. 02-3657\n\nconcluding there were questions concerning the propriety of\nthe rulemaking vis-à-vis the elimination of private-duty\nnursing services from the State’s Medicaid plan that could\nnot be resolved on the pleadings. Radaszewski ex rel.\nRadaszewski v. Garner, supra, 805 N.E.2d at 627.\n  The district court dismissed Radaszewski’s ADA claim\nand entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the\nDirector on the Rehabilitation Act claim. Radaszewski v.\nGarner, No. 01 C 9551, 2002 WL 31045384, 24 Nat’l\nDisability L. Rep. ¶ 187 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 11, 2002). Relying\non this court’s opinion in Walker v. Snyder, 213 F.3d 344\n(7th Cir. 2000), the court determined that Radaszewski\ncould not sue the Director in her official capacity in federal\ncourt for relief under Title II of the ADA. Walker held that\nthe doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S. Ct. 441\n(1908), which permits private suits against state officials in\nfederal court for injunctive relief, is unavailable in Title II\ncases; in Walker’s view, the proper defendant in such a case\nwas the state agency itself, which, in light of the Eleventh\nAmendment, could only be sued in state court. 213 F.3d at\n347. Although the district court agreed that case law post-\ndating Walker (including the Supreme Court’s decision in\nBoard of Trustees of Univ. of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S.\n356, 374 n.9, 121 S. Ct. 955, 968 n.9 (2001)) had called into\nquestion the validity of Walker’s holding, the court felt\nconstrained to follow Walker until such time as either this\ncourt or the Supreme Court overruled it. The court therefore\ndismissed the ADA claim. 2002 WL 31045384, at *2.\n  As for the Rehabilitation Act claim, the court reasoned\nthat neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the ADA “require[s]\nthat the State create and fund a program that does not al-\nready exist” in order to enable a disabled person to be cared\nfor in the most integrated community setting possible; rather,\nwhat the statutes require is even-handed treatment as be-\ntween able and disabled individuals. Id., at *3. In the\ncourt’s view, it was clear that the IDPA had not discrim-\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                     13\n\ninated against disabled individuals: although the State\nmakes at-home, private-duty nursing services available to\ndisabled individuals under the age of 21, no one over the\nage of 21—disabled or not—receives such services through\nthe Illinois Medicaid program. Id.4 In essence, Radaszewski\nwas seeking to compel the State to provide services to her\nson at home that it did not otherwise provide, and this\nexceeded the scope of the State’s duty under the Rehabilitation\nAct and the ADA. “[T]he IDPA is not required to provide the\nhandicapped more coverage than the non-handicapped\nindividual to assure ‘adequate health care.’ ” Id. For that\nreason the court concluded that the Director was entitled to\njudgment on the pleadings on the Rehabilitation Act claim.\nId.\n\n\n                                II.\n  We review de novo the district court’s decision to enter\njudgment on the pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 12(c). R.J. Corman Derailment Servs., LLC v.\nInt’l Union of Operating Engineers, Local 150, AFL-CIO,\n335 F.3d 643, 647 (7th Cir. 2003). In the course of that re-\nview, we accept the truth of the allegations in Radaszewski’s\n\n\n4\n  In fact, as the IDPA concedes, the HSP makes it possible for a\ndisabled person over the age of 21 to receive at least some private-\nduty nursing services at home. Although private-duty nursing\nservices have been removed from Illinois’s basic Medicaid plan, a\ndisabled individual can still access such services through the HSP\nwaiver program. However, the SCM or exceptional care rate\napproved for the individual HSP participant operates to limit the\namount of nursing care that he or she may receive. As we have\nnoted, the exceptional care rate approved for Eric would enable\nhim to receive only four or five hours of nursing per day, far less\nthan the 16 hours of daily care he received under the MFTDC\nprogram and the 24 hours per day that he and his parents cur-\nrently seek.\n\f14                                                No. 02-3657\n\ncomplaint. Id. Only if Radaszewski could prove no set of\nfacts consistent with those allegations that might support\nher claim for relief may we sustain the judgment entered in\nthe Director’s favor. Id.\n\n\n                               A.\n  The district court concluded on the strength of this court’s\nholding in Walker, 213 F.3d 344, that Radaszewski could\nnot sue the Director for injunctive relief under the ADA.\nHowever, Bruggeman ex rel. Bruggeman v. Blagojevich, 324\nF.3d 906, 912-13 (7th Cir. 2003), issued after the district\ncourt’s decision, recognized that Walker did not survive the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Garrett. Garrett explicitly\nrecognized the right of a private plaintiff to assert an ADA\nclaim for injunctive relief against a state official in federal\ncourt. 531 U.S. at 374 n.9, 121 S. Ct. at 968 n.9. The State\nconcedes, in view of Bruggeman, that Radaszewski may\nseek injunctive relief from the Director consistent with the\ndoctrine of Ex Parte Young. Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 912-13.\nWe therefore proceed to the merits of Radaszewski’s ADA\nclaim as well as her Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n\n                              B.\n  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against\ndisabled persons by any public entity:\n     [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by rea-\n     son of such disability, be excluded from participation in\n     or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or\n     activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimi-\n     nation by any such entity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. The statute defines a “qualified individ-\nual with a disability” as one who, “with or without reason-\nable modifications to rules, policies, or practices . . . meets\nthe essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of ser-\n\fNo. 02-3657                                               15\n\nvices or the participation in programs or activities provided\nby a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). The term “public\nentity” is defined to include “any State or local govern-\nment,” as well as “any department, agency, special purpose\ndistrict or other instrumentality of a State . . . or local\ngovernment.” § 12131(1)(a)(A), (B).\n  Pursuant to Title II, the Attorney General has promul-\ngated a regulation providing that “[a] public entity shall\nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified\nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The\n“most integrated setting appropriate” is in turn defined as\n“a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to\ninteract with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent\npossible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p. 450. This integration\nmandate does not impose an unqualified obligation on a\npublic agency, however. Although an agency must make\nsuch modifications as are “reasonable” in order to avoid un-\nduly segregating the disabled, it is relieved of that obli-\ngation if it can show “that making the modifications would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\nactivity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\n  The Rehabilitation Act, which applies to programs receiv-\ning federal financial assistance, contains a similar\nantidiscrimination provision, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and a\ncorresponding regulation requiring that an agency adminis-\nter its programs and activities “in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped\npersons,” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). The ADA’s integration\nregulation is modeled after that regulation. See Olmstead v.\nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 592, 119 S. Ct. 2176,\n2183 (1999). And consistent with the ADA’s regulatory\nscheme, that integration mandate is limited by regulatory\nprovisions indicating that a recipient of federal funding\nneed not accommodate a disabled person when the proposed\n\f16                                                No. 02-3657\n\naccommodation would impose an “undue hardship” on the\nrecipient. 28 C.F.R. §§ 41.53, 42.511(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(c).\n  In view of the similarities between the relevant provisions\nof the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and their implement-\ning regulations, courts construe and apply them in a\nconsistent manner. Frederick L. v. Dep’t of Public Welfare of\nPennsylvania, 364 F.3d 487, 491 (3d Cir. 2004); Fisher v.\nOklahoma Health Care Auth., 335 F.3d 1175, 1179 n.3 (10th\nCir. 2003); see also Bruggeman, supra, 324 F.3d at 912\n(noting that the statutory and regulatory provisions\nconcerning integrated care are “materially identical”). Al-\nthough our analysis shall focus on the ADA, that analysis\napplies with equal force to Radaszewski’s Rehabilitation Act\nclaim.\n  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court, looking to the terms\nand legislative history of the ADA’s Title II, along with the\nintegration mandate reflected in its implementing regula-\ntions, held that the “unjustified institutional isolation” of a\ndisabled individual receiving medical care from a State\namounts to an actionable form of discrimination under Title\nII. 527 U.S. at 597-603, 119 S. Ct. at 2185-88. That is so,\nthe Court concluded, even in the absence of traditional\nproof that the disabled person is being treated differently\nfrom a nondisabled person who is otherwise similarly situ-\nated. Id. at 598, 119 S. Ct. at 2186.\n     Recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of\n     persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination\n     reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional place-\n     ment of persons who can handle and benefit from com-\n     munity settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions\n     that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of\n     participating in community life. Second, confinement in\n     an institution severely diminishes the everyday life\n     activities of individuals, including family relations,\n     social contacts, work options, economic independence,\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 17\n\n    educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.\n    Dissimilar treatment correspondingly exists in this key\n    respect: In order to received needed medical services,\n    persons with . . . disabilities must, because of those\n    disabilities, relinquish participation in community life\n    they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations,\n    while persons without [such] disabilities can receive the\n    medical services they need without similar sacrifice.\nId. at 600-01, 119 S. Ct. at 2187 (citations omitted). The\nplaintiffs in Olmstead were individuals with mental dis-\nabilities who had been institutionalized in state facilities.\nAlthough their treatment providers had concluded that\ntheir needs could be met in community-based programs,\ntheir placement into such programs had been delayed, and\nthe plaintiffs filed suit under Title II, seeking to compel the\nState to transfer them into a community setting. In view of\nthe integration mandate, the Court agreed with the plain-\ntiffs that a State is obliged to provide community-based\ntreatment for individuals with disabilities, so long as the\nState’s treatment professionals find that such treatment is\nappropriate, the affected individuals do not oppose\ncommunity-based treatment, and placement in the commu-\nnity can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account\nthe State’s resources and the needs of others with similar\ndisabilities. Id. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190. In a footnote, the\nCourt disavowed any intent to hold that the ADA imposes on\nthe States either a particular standard of care or a require-\nment that they provide a particular level of benefits to\ndisabled persons. Id. at 603 n.14, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 n.14.\n“We do hold, however, that States must adhere to the ADA’s\nnondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services\nthey in fact provide.” Ibid.\n  Radaszewski contends that Illinois’s unwillingness to\ncontinue funding private-duty nursing care for Eric at home\nportends precisely the type of “unjustified institutional\nisolation” for him that Olmstead described as form of\n\f18                                               No. 02-3657\n\ndiscrimination prohibited by the ADA. She asserts that Eric\nsatisfies each of the three conditions that the Court in\nOlmstead cited as prerequisites to the State’s obligation to\nprovide community-based treatment. Indeed, it appears\nthat two of these conditions—the propriety of community-\nbased care for Eric, and the consent of Eric and his affected\nfamily members—are undisputed. There is little doubt that\nEric can be cared for appropriately at home; he has been\nreceiving care at home since 1994, and according to the\ncomplaint, he benefits from the support of and interaction\nwith his parents in that environment. And obviously, neither\nhe nor his family oppose the prospect of him remaining at\nhome; that is the point of Radaszewski’s complaint. As for\nthe third condition—the State’s ability to reasonably accom-\nmodate community-based care for the disabled individual—\nRadaszewski asserts that the cost of at-home, private-duty\nnursing for Eric is actually less than what the State would\nspend if Eric were transferred to an institution. Thus,\nRadaszewski believes that the State reasonably can accom-\nmodate continued at-home care for Eric without jeopardiz-\ning its resources or interfering with the State’s obligation to\ncare for other disabled individuals. One of the ways that it\nmight do this, Radaszewski suggests, is by increasing the\ncap on the amount that the HSP will pay for the services\nthat disabled individuals need in order to remain at home.\n  The Director, on the other hand, construes Radaszewski’s\ncomplaint to require a substantive change in the services\nIDPA currently provides. Picking up on footnote 14 of the\nOlmstead opinion, the State emphasizes that the ADA does\nnot guarantee that each recipient of state medical benefits\nwill get care precisely tailored to his needs; instead, the\nstatute requires the State not to discriminate vis-à-vis\nservices that it has chosen to provide. 527 U.S. at 603 n.14,\n119 S. Ct. at 2188 n.14. Thus, post-Olmstead, courts have\nrecognized that a State may violate Title II when it refuses\nto provide an existing benefit to a disabled person that\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                19\n\nwould enable that individual to live in a more community-\nintegrated setting. E.g., Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care\nAuth., supra, 335 F.3d at 1182-84 (State may violate Title\nII when it caps the number of drug prescriptions it will fund\nthrough Medicaid for participants in community-based care\nprograms, but not for persons who live in nursing homes);\nTownsend v. Quasim, 328 F.3d 511, 516-20 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(community-based long-term care offered to categorically\nneedy must be offered to medically needy as well, unless\ndoing so would fundamentally alter the State’s Medicaid\nprograms). On the other hand, courts have also held that a\nState is not obligated to create new services in order to\nenable an institutionalized individual to live in a more\nintegrated setting. E.g., Rodriguez v. City of New York, 197\nF.3d 611, 615-16 (2d Cir. 1999) (neither ADA nor Rehabili-\ntation Act compelled State to offer safety monitoring to\npersons with mental disabilities so that such individuals\ncould remain at home, where safety monitoring was not an\nexisting personal care service that city offered through its\nMedicaid program).\n  Here, IDPA argues, the State’s basic Medicaid plan (by\nvirtue of the amendment approved in 2001) does not include\nprivate-duty nursing services. Of course, nursing generally\nis a service provided, but the particular service that Eric\nrequires is one-on-one, private-duty nursing. The only\nindividuals to whom that type of nursing is offered at the\nlevel that Eric requires are persons under the age of 21, who\nmay receive such services under the MFTDC waiver program.\nSee n.1, supra. Funding for private-duty nursing is avail-\nable through the HSP program, but at a level no higher\nthan the exceptional care rate—which in this case would\npermit no more than five hours of nursing per day. Thus, in\norder for Radaszewski to obtain the relief she seeks for Eric,\nthe IDPA either would have to raise the age limit for\nparticipation in the MFTDC program or raise the level of\ncare covered by the HSP by substantially increasing the\n\f20                                               No. 02-3657\n\nexceptional care rate for individuals with disabilities akin\nto Eric’s. In the State’s view, neither modification is a\nreasonable one, and either one would compel the IDPA to\nalter the substance of the services it provides to Medicaid\nrecipients and thus to offer a new service that does not\ncurrently exist.\n  A key premise of the State’s argument is that private-\nduty nursing would not be provided to Eric in the institu-\ntional setting that the IDPA believes is appropriate to his\nlevel of need—i.e., in a nursing home facility. However,\nfrom the face of the complaint, the documents in the public\nrecord relating to Eric’s IDPA grievance, and the briefing in\nthis appeal, there appear to be at least two important\nfactual questions relating to this premise that cannot be\nresolved on the pleadings.\n  The first of these questions is whether a nursing home\nfacility actually could meet Eric’s medical needs, as the\nDirector supposes. As we noted earlier, the IDPA calculated\nthe level of benefits for which Eric was eligible under the\nHSP with reference to the cost of care at a nursing home\nfacility; and the IDPA took the position that Eric would\nhave to seek care in that type of facility if HSP funding at\nthe exceptional care rate was insufficient to pay for his care\nat home. However, the Radaszewskis have consistently\nchallenged the notion that Eric could receive adequate care\nat a nursing home facility. When Eric filed a grievance with\nthe IDPA challenging the exceptional care rate that the\nDepartment had established for Eric, his parents put on\nevidence that Eric could not properly be cared for in a\nnursing home facility as the State contended, because such\na facility could not provide the constant, one-on-one care\nthat he needs in order to survive. Based on that evidence,\nwhich apparently was uncontradicted, the hearing officer\nwhose findings we quoted above specifically found that Eric\n“would be at risk of danger if he should be placed in a\nnursing home.” IDPA Hearing Officer findings ¶ H. In view\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                  21\n\nof that finding, we must assume that Radaszewski will be\nable to prove in this litigation that Eric, if institutionalized,\nwould require a more care-intensive setting than a nursing\nhome—a hospital, for example—in order to survive. That\npossibility in turn suggests that the type and cost of\nmedical care that Eric would receive at a nursing home\nfacility are not the appropriate reference points for assess-\ning whether the private-duty nursing that Eric seeks to\nreceive at home is a service that would be provided to Eric\nin an institutional setting.\n  The second question concerns the level of care that Eric\nwould require in an institutional setting—whether it be a\nnursing home facility, a hospital, or another type of care\nfacility. The State posits that Eric would not receive private\nnursing care in any institutional setting, even a hospital, so\nthat there is no institutional precedent that would support\nhis demand under Title II for private-duty nursing at home.\nCf. Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183 (“Plaintiffs are simply request-\ning that a service for which they would be eligible under an\nexisting state program, unlimited medically necessary\nprescriptions, be provided in a community-based setting\nrather than a nursing home. They are not demanding a\nseparate service or one not already offered by the state.”);\nTownsend, 328 F.3d at 517 (“Mr. Townsend simply requests\nthat the services he is already eligible to receive under an\nexisting state program . . . be provided in the community-\nbased adult home where he lives, rather than the nursing\nhome setting the state requires.”). Here again, however, the\nevidence presented to the IDPA hearing officer, and that\nofficer’s findings, suggest that Eric might well require\ncontinuous one-on-one nursing care if he were cared for in\nan institutional setting. The hearing officer’s summary of\nthe testimony provided by Eric’s caretakers, most if not all\nof which was undisputed, makes it plausible to suppose that\nEric cannot be left unattended—or attended only by a\nperson lacking significant medical skills— for any amount\n\f22                                               No. 02-3657\n\nof time. It appears from that summary that he requires\nskilled assistance in order to safely accomplish many of the\nbodily functions necessary to remain alive—drinking,\neating, eliminating waste, moving about, even breathing.\nRadaszewski may thus be able to show that if institutional-\nized, Eric would require the equivalent of the private-duty\nnursing care that, until now, he has received at home.\n  The Director concedes that if Eric were placed in an\ninstitution, the IDPA would obliged to provide him with the\nlevel of care that he needs in order to survive. So if, as the\nevidence presented to the IDPA hearing officer strongly\nsuggests, Eric requires constant monitoring and continuous\nskilled assistance in accomplishing basic bodily functions,\nthen the State will have to provide those services to Eric in\nan institutional setting. It may well be, as the Director\nrepresents, that an institutional facility would not assign\nprivate-duty nurses, as such, to provide the care that Eric\nrequires. In lieu of one nurse assigned only to Eric, for\nexample, a hospital might be able to rely on a variety of\nmonitors to keep Eric’s life signs under surveillance, while\na pool of immediately available skilled professionals tending\nto multiple patients in a care-intensive unit might be able\nto provide the frequent, immediate assistance Eric requires\nin order to eat, drink, and so on and to head off any of the\nmedical crises (e.g., choking or infections) to which he is\nvulnerable. But if what that level of care adds up to is the\nequivalent of around-the-clock, private-duty nursing care,\nthen Radaszewski may yet have a viable claim that Eric is\nentitled to receive private-duty nursing care at home.\n   Nothing in the regulations promulgated under the ADA\nor the Rehabilitation Act or in the Court’s decision in\nOlmstead conditions the viability of a Title II or section 504\nclaim on proof that the services a plaintiff wishes to receive\nin a community-integrated setting already exist in exactly\nthe same form in the institutional setting. Although a State\nis not obliged to create entirely new services or to otherwise\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 23\n\nalter the substance of the care that it provides to Medicaid\nrecipients in order to accommodate an individual’s desire to\nbe cared for at home, the integration mandate may well\nrequire the State to make reasonable modifications to the\nform of existing services in order to adapt them to com-\nmunity-integrated settings. Some forms of medical treat-\nment—for example, prescription medications—might be\nvirtually the same whether provided to the recipient in an\ninstitution or at home. See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183. But\nparticularly when the treatment involves services provided\nby medical professionals, the care might vary in format\ndepending on whether it is provided to the individual in an\ninstitution or a community-based setting. If variations in\nthe way services are delivered in different settings were\nenough to defeat a demand for more community-integrated\ncare, then the integration mandate of the ADA and the\nRehabilitation Act would mean very little. Of course, the\nState always has the opportunity to show that adapting\nexisting institution-based services to a community-based\nsetting would impose unreasonable burdens or fundamen-\ntally alter the nature of its programs and services, and for\nthat reason it should not be required to accommodate the\nplaintiff. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at\n603-06, 119 S. Ct. at 2188-90. But so long as it is possible for\nthe plaintiff to show that the services he seeks to receive at\nhome are, in substance, already provided in the institu-\ntional setting, then the State is not entitled to judgment on\nthe pleadings based on the argument that the services\nwould take on a different form or method if provided in a\ncommunity setting.\n  Also relevant to the question of whether continuous\nprivate-duty nursing is a service that Illinois does not\npresently offer in any setting is the fact that IDPA can and\ndoes make available a limited amount of funding for pri-\nvate-duty nursing to adults participating in the HSP. Recall\nthat the purpose of a waiver program like HSP is to enable\nmedically needy individuals to avoid institutionalization by\n\f24                                                    No. 02-3657\n\nmaking services available to them that are otherwise not\npart of the State’s basic Medicaid program. At-home\nnursing care, which has now been removed from Illinois’s\nMedicaid plan, would constitute such a service. The cap on\nthe level of funding that HSP would provide to Eric and his\nfamily prevents him from receiving the level of private-duty\nnursing services that he needs—recall that the exceptional\ncare rate approved for Eric would pay for only four or five\nhours of private-duty nursing per day rather than the 24\nhours per day that his family seeks. But the fact that the\nState already provides for some private-duty nursing tends\nto belie the notion that providing such care to Eric so that\nhe may remain at home would require the State to alter the\nsubstance of its Medicaid programs by creating an entirely\n“new”service.\n   Insofar as the HSP is concerned, the State contends that\nEric is ineligible for that program (and that Radaszewski\ncannot plead or prove otherwise) because the cost of the\ncontinuous care that he needs admittedly exceeds the cost\nof exceptional care in a nursing facility, the latter figure\nbeing the most that IDPA, under its current rules, will pay\nfor Eric’s at-home care. That point is not dispositive of the\nfederal claims that Radaszewski has made here. It is true,\nas the Director points out, that the ADA only prohibits\ndiscrimination against “qualified individuals with disabili-\nties,” whom (as we noted earlier) the statute describes as\ndisabled individuals who “with or without reasonable modi-\nfications to rules, policies, or practices . . . mee[t] the essential\neligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the\nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public\nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601-\n02, 119 S. Ct. at 2187-88. For present purposes, it appears\nundisputed that Eric is qualified for the receipt of home\nservices through the HSP in the sense that he has severe,\nlong-term disabilities, he is eligible for Medicaid, and he is\nat risk of placement in an institutional health care facility.\nSee 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 682.100 (setting forth HSP\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 25\n\neligibility requirements). It is also undisputed that his\nhome is an appropriate care setting for Eric—he has lived\nthere since the onset of his disabilities with the support of\nthe at-home services that he received through the MFTDC\nwaiver program until he reached the age of 21—the very\nsame services that he seeks to continue receiving as an\nadult.\n  By no means is Eric an “unqualified” disabled person in\nthe sense that Olmstead emphasized—he is not someone\nwho is “unable to handle or benefit from community set-\ntings,” 527 U.S. at 601-02; 119 S. Ct. at 2187, whom the\nState’s medical professionals believe is not able to live in a\ncommunity-integrated setting, id. at 602, 119 S. Ct. at 2188,\nor who does not want to live in a such a setting, ibid. On the\ncontrary, Radaszewski’s complaint, together with the IDPA\ngrievance records, suggest that with appropriate care Eric\ncan live at home (he has in fact done so for a number of\nyears), that he wishes to continue doing so, and that he\nprofits in that environment from the daily interaction with\nand nurturing by his parents and the access to on-line\nlearning that he has at home. Supplemental Complaint Count\nI ¶ 11, Count VI ¶¶ 40-46, Count VII ¶¶ 42-45; IDPA Hear-\ning Officer Findings ¶ A (“[Eric] has been cared [for] at\nhome for the past 5 years through funding from the Illinois\nDivision of Specialized Care for Children (DSCC). This care,\nplus the admirable efforts of his parents, has allowed\nGrievant to be cared for in his home. Grievant wishes to be\nmaintained in his home with his family; this is also his\nparents’ wish[ ].”). Eric thus appears to meet these “essential”\nrequirements for at-home care. See Townsend, 328 F.3d at\n516 (plaintiff was a “qualified individual with a disability”\nfor purposes of Title II because he was eligible to receive\nservices through State’s Medicaid program, he preferred to\nreceive such services in a community-based setting, and\ncommunity-based services were appropriate for his needs).\n  Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, Eric is\nalso qualified for the HSP program in the sense that the\n\f26                                                  No. 02-3657\n\ncost of his continued care at home would not exceed the\nanticipated cost of caring for him in an institutional setting.\nAs we have noted, approval for Medicaid waiver programs\noffering community-based care is conditioned on certifica-\ntion that the average per-capita cost of at-home or other\ncommunity-based care does not exceed the average per-\ncapita cost of institutional care. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D);\n42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e). In view of that federal requirement,\none of the eligibility requirements that Illinois has specified\nfor participation in the HSP program is that an individual\ndoes not require in-home services that are expected to cost\nmore than what the State would pay to provide institutional\ncare to an individual with a similar DON score. 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code § 682.100(h). As we have noted, Radaszewski\nasserts that the cost of providing private-duty nursing care\nto Eric at home, although it exceeds the exceptional care\nrate approved for Eric by several multiples, is nonetheless\nno greater and perhaps less than what it would cost the\nState to care for Eric in an appropriate institution. We\nassume, as we must, that Radaszewski will be able to prove\nthe truth of that assertion. Her assertion is plausible,\nparticularly in view of the fact that the MFTDC program,\nthrough which Eric received funding for private-duty\nnursing until he turned 21, has a similar requirement of\ncost-neutrality. See 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 140.645(c)(3).\nConsequently, we discern no impediment concerning Eric’s\nstatus as a “qualified individual with a disability” that\nwould preclude the relief his mother seeks under Title II.\n  The cost of around-the-clock private-duty nursing care no\ndoubt is relevant to the separate question of whether re-\nquiring the State to continue providing that care for Eric at\nhome would entail reasonable modifications to IDPA’s rules\nand practices or would result in a fundamental alteration of\nthe services and programs that Illinois provides to similarly\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                      27\n\nsituated individuals.5 As we have noted, the cost of provid-\ning 24-hour private-duty nursing care to Eric at home is\nestimated at between $15,000 and $20,000 per month, an\namount three to four times greater than the exceptional\ncare rate approved for Eric. So in that respect, the State\nwould have to substantially increase the level of expendi-\ntures it would otherwise make on Eric’s behalf under the\nHSP in order to continue Eric’s at-home care. That alone\ndoes not defeat his Title II claim. See Fisher, 335 F.3d at\n1183 (“If every alteration in a program or service that\nrequired the outlay of funds were tantamount to a funda-\n\n\n5\n   The plaintiffs in Olmstead were, as we have indicated, persons\nwith mental disabilities. When it addressed the fundamental-\nalteration defense in that case, the Supreme Court spoke of the\nneed to consider the State’s obligations to other persons with the\nsame broad type of disabilities, i.e., other persons with mental\ndisabilities. See 527 U.S. at 604, 119 S. Ct. at 2189 (“Sensibly con-\nstrued, the fundamental-alteration component of the reasonable-\nmodifications regulation would allow the State to show that, in\nthe allocation of available resources, immediate relief for the\nplaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State\nhas undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse\npopulation of persons with mental disabilities.”) (emphasis ours);\nid. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190 (“[W]e conclude that, under Title II\nof the ADA, States are required to provide community-based treat-\nment for persons with mental disabilities when the State’s treatment\nprofessionals determine that such placement is appropriate, the\naffected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement\ncan be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources\navailable to the State and the needs of others with mental disabili-\nties.”) (emphasis ours). It is not immediately apparent here what\nthe relevant group of disabled persons should be for purposes of\nthe fundamental-alteration defense, and this is not a matter that\nthe parties themselves have addressed in the briefing. For present\npurposes, we will refer simply to other persons with disabilities\nsimilar to Eric’s. If and when the fundamental-alteration defense\nis reached in further proceedings, the parties and the district court\nwill want to consider how to more precisely define and describe\nthat group.\n\f28                                                No. 02-3657\n\nmental alteration, the ADA’s integration mandate would be\nhollow indeed.”). Once again, however, if, as Radaszewski\nrepresents, it would cost the State no more and possibly less\nto care for Eric at home than it would to care for him in an\ninstitution, this would be highly relevant to whether the\nState is obliged under Title II to provide him with full-time,\nat-home care.\n  Olmstead did note that because a State is obliged to\nmaintain a full range of facilities in order to provide care for\nits disabled citizens, it may not always be able to fully\nrealize the cost savings of placing an individual person in a\ncommunity setting rather than an institution. 527 U.S. at\n604, 119 S. Ct. at 2189. Moving one resident of a state-\nfunded institution into the community does not necessarily\nmean that the State immediately could close or reduce the\nsize of that institution; in the short run, the State might\nincur greater costs by funding a community placement for\nthe individual who can be cared for there while continuing\nto provide institutional services for those who cannot be\ncared for in a community setting. Ibid. A court must\ntherefore take care to consider the cost of a plaintiff’s care\nnot in isolation, but in the context of the care it must\nprovide to all individuals with disabilities comparable to\nthose of the plaintiff.\n   This is not an assessment that can be made on the\npleadings in this case. The State may be able to show that\nin view of the obligations it has not just to Eric but to all\nindividuals with similar disabilities, it cannot fund a home\nplacement for Eric without fundamentally altering the care\nit provides to others with similar needs. But the evidence\nmight also show something different to be true. If the State\nwould have to pay a private facility to care for Eric, for\nexample, and the cost of that placement equaled or ex-\nceeded the cost of caring for him at home, then it would be\ndifficult to see how requiring the State to pay for at-home\ncare would amount to an unreasonable, fundamental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                29\n\nalteration of its programs and services. Indeed, Radaszewski\nrepresents that this is precisely the case in Illinois, and\nthat, as a result, if Eric were to be cared for in an institu-\ntion, the State would be paying a private contractor to pro-\nvide that care. In any event, what matters at present is that\na much more developed record will be required in order to\nassess whether the injunctive relief that Radaszewski seeks\nwould require a fundamental alteration of the State’s pro-\ngrams and services.\n  The district court therefore erred in entering judgment on\nthe pleadings in the Director’s favor. The allegations of\nRadaszewski’s complaint permit the inference that a home\nplacement remains appropriate for Eric, that he and his\nfamily do not oppose such a placement, and that such a\nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into\naccount the resources available to the State and the needs\nof others with comparable disabilities. See Olmstead, 527\nU.S. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190. At the same time, the plead-\nings do not permit a finding that the injunctive relief that\nRadaszewski seeks either is unreasonable or would require\na fundamental alteration of the State’s programs and ser-\nvices for similarly-situated disabled persons. Radaszewski\nis entitled to proceed on her complaint.\n\n\n                            III.\n  For the reasons discussed, we REVERSE the judgment on\nthe pleadings entered in favor of the IDPA Director and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f30                                       No. 02-3657\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                   ________________________________\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of\n                     Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—9-8-04\n\f",

Until he reached the age of 21, the Illinois\nDepartment of Public Aid (“IDPA” or the “Department”)\nprovided funding through a Medicaid program for children\nthat enabled Eric to receive 16 hours of private-duty nurs-\ning at home each day. After he turned 21, Eric was no\nlonger eligible to participate in that program. Illinois has a\nseparate program providing at-home care for adults who\nwould otherwise have to be cared for in institutions. How-\never, funding under that program is capped at a level that\nis insufficient to pay for the extent of private-duty nursing\nthat Eric would need in order to remain at home. Conse-\nquently, Eric faces the prospect of entering a long-term care\nfacility in order to receive the intensive medical care that he\nneeds. Eric’s mother, Donna Radaszewski, filed this suit\nagainst the Director of the IDPA (the “Director”) on Eric’s\nbehalf, contending that the IDPA’s failure to fully fund at-\nhome, private-duty nursing for Eric amounts to disability\ndiscrimination in violation of section 504 of the Rehabilita-\ntion Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (the “Rehabilitation Act”),\nand Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n42 U.S.C. § 12132 (the “ADA”), in that Illinois is refusing to\nprovide the medical services that Eric requires in order to\nremain in the most community-integrated setting appropri-\nate for his needs, which is his home. The district court\nentered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Director,\nreasoning that the ADA claim against the Director was\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment and that the Rehabili-\ntation Act claim failed as a matter of law because in-home\nnursing care is not a service that Illinois currently provides\nto any adult individual. We reverse and remand for further\nproceedings.\n\n\n                              I.\n  As this case was resolved on the basis of the pleadings, we\naccept the facts alleged in Radaszewski’s supplemental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                  3\n\ncomplaint as true.

After undergoing surgery, radiation, and\nchemotherapy to treat the cancer, Eric suffered a mid-brain\nstroke in 1993. The cancer, stroke, and medical treatment\nhave impaired Eric’s physical and mental functions and left\nhim medically fragile. In the opinion of his physician, Eric\nrequires one-on-one care by a registered nurse 24 hours per\nday in order to survive.\n  Since July 1994, Eric has received around-the-clock care\nat his parents’ home. In August 1995, when his family had\nexhausted its medical insurance benefits, Eric began to\nreceive at-home nursing care through the Illinois Medicaid\nprogram.\n  Medicaid, a program funded jointly by the States and the\nfederal government, provides medical assistance both to dis-\nabled individuals and to families with dependent children\nwhose income and resources are otherwise insufficient to\npay for the cost of the medical care that they require. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396; 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1. Each State\nparticipating in the Medicaid program must submit for\napproval to the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human\nServices (“HHS”) a plan setting forth the services that the\nState will provide in its Medicaid program. 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1396, 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a), 42 C.F.R. § 440.230(a).\n  “Private-duty nursing,” defined as nursing services pro-\nvided to a person who requires more individualized and\ncontinuous care than would routinely be provided by a\nvisiting nurse or by the nursing staff of a hospital or skilled\n\f4                                                No. 02-3657\n\nnursing facility, 42 C.F.R. § 440.80, is one of the services\nthat a State may elect to include in its Medicaid plan. 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(8), 1396a(a)(10)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 440.225.\nA State may choose to provide private-duty nursing services\nat the recipient’s home, at a hospital, or at a skilled nursing\nfacility. 42 C.F.R. § 440.80(c). Prior to this litigation, the\nIllinois Medicaid plan included coverage for private-duty\nnursing, provided that such nursing was recommended by\na physician, prior approval was obtained from the appropri-\nate State agency, and the care was provided by someone\nother than the recipient’s relative; the plan imposed no\nlimitation on the cost of such care, nor did it limit where\nprivate-duty nursing could be provided to the Medicaid\nrecipient. See Radaszewski ex rel. Radaszewski v. Garner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623-24 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003), supplemented on\ndenial of reh’g (March 25, 2004). In the course of this litiga-\ntion, however, Illinois drafted an amendment to its\nMedicaid plan to delete all references to private-duty\nnursing and submitted the amendment to HHS for clear-\nance; the Secretary approved that amendment on February\n2, 2001. Id. at 622-23; Radaszewski Reply Br. Addendum\n12-13. The State then initiated rulemaking under the\nIllinois Administrative Procedure Act to implement the\nchange; that process was completed as of September 1,\n2001. See Radaszewski, 805 N.E.2d at 622-23.\n  In addition to the services outlined in their basic Medicaid\nplans, States may seek HHS approval to provide home and\ncommunity-based services to individuals who would other-\nwise require institutional care. The HHS Secretary may\napprove these services in the exercise of his “waiver” au-\nthority, so labeled because it empowers the Secretary to\nwaive certain Medicaid requirements that would otherwise\nconstrain a State’s ability to offer these services—e.g.,\nservice limitations and financial eligibility criteria. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396n(b)-(h); 42 C.F.R. § 430.25(d). This power is\noften used to authorize innovative and experimental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                     5\n\nprograms. As relevant here, it facilitates state programs\ndesigned to provide home- and community-based services to\npersons who would otherwise have to be cared for in nursing\nhomes or other institutions: specifically, the Secretary may\nissue waivers permitting a State to offer these services only\nto individuals who need them in order to avoid\ninstitutionalization, rather than to every State citizen who\nqualifies for Medicaid. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1). In seeking\napproval for a waiver program offering home and commu-\nnity care, however, the State must certify that it is cost-\nneutral in the sense that the average per-person cost of the\ncare offered through the waiver program does not exceed\nthe average cost of providing that care in an institutional\nsetting. See § 1396n(c)(2)(D); 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e).\n   Pursuant to this waiver authority, HHS has approved\nIllinois’s Medicaid program for Medically Fragile, Technology\nDependent Children (the “MFTDC program”). This program\noffers a variety of home- and community-based services and\nequipment to medically fragile persons under the age of 21\nwho would otherwise have to be cared for in a skilled\npediatric facility or a hospital. See 89 Ill. Admin. Code §\n140.645. The services offered by this program include\nprivate-duty shift nursing and respite care in the recipient’s\nhome. The amount of services that a person may receive\nunder this program is determined with reference to the cost\nof the care that he or she alternatively would require in a\nskilled pediatric facility or a hospital. 89 Ill. Admin. Code\n§ 140.645(c)(3).1\n\n\n1\n  The Director points out that Congress has required each State\nto provide comprehensive medical screening, diagnostic, and\ntreatment to persons under the age of 21, even if such care\ninvolves services not otherwise covered under the State’s basic\nMedicaid plan. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r); see also\n305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-19(a) (outlining Illinois’s Healthy\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f6                                                 No. 02-3657\n\n  Eric was found eligible for the MFTDC program and be-\ngan receiving services in 1995. Based on the estimated cost\nof the level of care that Eric would require in a medical\ninstitution, the IDPA approved a care plan for Eric that\ncalled for 16 hours per day of in-home nursing services\nprovided by registered nurses. Eric’s parents, who were\ngiven special training so that they could provide the nec-\nessary care for Eric, tended to him the remaining eight\nhours of each day. In order to provide them with periodic\nrelief from that responsibility, the IDPA also provided Eric\nan additional 336 hours of respite nursing services per year.\nThe IDPA approved this care plan annually until Eric\nreached the age of 21 when, by virtue of his age, he became\nineligible for continued participation in the MFTDC\nprogram.\n  Illinois has a separate HHS-approved waiver program for\ndisabled adults—the Home Services Program (“HSP”)—\nwhich, like the MFTDC program, offers services not other-\nwise covered by the State’s basic Medicaid program and\nwhich enables such adults to continue living at home in lieu\nof being cared for in an institution, provided that the cost of\nat-home care does not exceed the cost of institutional care.\nSee 89 Ill. Admin. Code §§ 676.10(a), 676.30(j), 682.100.\nHowever, the services provided pursuant to the HSP are\nlimited by a Service Cost Maximum (“SCM”) established by\nthe IDPA. 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 679.50(a). The SCM is\ndetermined with reference to what it would cost to provide\nnursing care to the recipient in an institutional setting, e.g.,\na hospital or a nursing facility. See id.; see also 42 C.F.R. §\n441.302(c). Based on his degree of impairment and his need\nfor medical care, an individual who seeks to participate in\n\n\n1\n  (...continued)\nKids Program). By virtue of that mandate, States may in practice\noffer more Medicaid services to persons under the age of 21 than\nthey do to adults.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                          7\n\nthe HSP is assigned a Determination of Need (“DON”) score\nreflecting his risk of institutionalization. See 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode §§ 676.30(d), 679.10-679.50. Eric received a DON score\nof 70, and at that time, the standard SCM for an individual\nwith that DON score was $1,857.00 per month. See 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code § 679.50 (b) (setting forth current SCMs for\nparticipants in HSP). A higher “exceptional care rate” may\nbe approved for an individual with a “complex medical\ndiagnosis.” See 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5.8a; 89 Ill.\nAdmin.

However, in the assessment of Eric’s physician,\nthat amount would only be sufficient to cover four to five\nhours per day of at-home nursing services for Eric. The\nestimated cost of maintaining Eric’s at-home care 24 hours\nper day3 is between $15,000 and $20,000 per month.\n\n\n2\n   The exceptional care rate corresponds to what the IDPA would\npay a skilled nursing facility to provide “exceptional medical care” to\nthe individual. See 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-5.8a; 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode § 140.569(a)(1). “Exceptional medical care” is defined as “the\nlevel of medical care required by persons who are medically stable for\ndischarge from a hospital but who require acute intensity hospital\nlevel care for physician, nurse, and ancillary specialist services .\n. . .” 305 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 5/5-1.1(i); see also 89 Ill. Admin.\nCode § 140.569(a)(2). Persons eligible for such care, and for\nreimbursement at the exceptional care rate, include (but are not\nlimited to) individuals with head injuries, ventilator-dependent\npersons, and persons with HIV/AIDS. Id.\n3\n  Although Eric’s parents historically have provided eight hours\nof care to Eric each day, the record indicates that they are now\nseeking to have the State fund 24-hour-per-day care to Eric, as the\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f8                                                   No. 02-3657\n\nHowever, the ORS contended that it was not authorized to\npay for at-home medical care in excess of what it would cost\nto provide exceptional care for Eric at a skilled nursing\nfacility. The IDPA took the position that if funding at the\nexceptional care rate was insufficient to provide for Eric’s\ncare at home, then he would to have to move to an institu-\ntional setting in order to receive care. It determined that\nEric could be adequately cared for in a nursing home\nfacility.\n  Eric filed an administrative grievance with the IDPA,\ncontending that the Department should be required to pay\nmore than the exceptional care rate so that he could con-\ntinue receiving the care he requires at home rather than in\na nursing home. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing\nconducted in July 2000, a hearing officer made a number of\nfactual determinations, including the following findings as\nto the level of care that Eric requires:\n    H. The uncontradicted evidence submitted by Grievant\n    [Eric] is that the Grievant would be at risk of danger if\n    he should be placed in a nursing home. Grievant’s\n    doctor testified that Grievant needs substantial one on\n    one nursing care to survive. He is medically fragile, prone\n    to infections, immobilized, catheterized and relies on\n    oxygen. A registered nurse is required to look for prob-\n    lems before they become “full blown and he crashes,”\n    according to Grievant’s doctor. His immunological re-\n    sponses were severely compromised due to earlier radi-\n    ation and chemotherapy, so skilled nursing care is a\n\n\n3\n   (...continued)\nstate of their own health has diminished their ability to care for\nEric themselves. Eric’s father has suffered a stroke and can no\nlonger drive or help move Eric. Eric’s mother was diagnosed with\na brain tumor, and as a result of the tumor and the treatment for\nit, she cannot tolerate heat and suffers from dizzy spells. IDPA\nHearing Officer Findings ¶ G.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                               9\n\n   “question of survival, not a question of doing well.” The\n   physician strongly urged that Grievant be given the\n   funds to support 24 hours per day of skilled nursing\n   care. Placing Grievant in a nursing home facility of the\n   type suggested by the State, according to the physician,\n   would result in Grievant being seriously medically com-\n   promised, which would lead to many hospitalizations.\n   I. Grievant’s physician’s opinion was supported by the\n   registered nurse in charge of Grievant’s care. He\n   described Grievant’s medical needs in detail. Grievant\n   has no sense of thirst, so his hydration must be care-\n   fully monitored in order to avoid serious medical com-\n   plications. Although Grievant has difficulty swallowing,\n   he can be given soft food, but only under careful condi-\n   tions. His nutrition must be carefully monitored.\n   Grievant cannot protect his airway by turning his head;\n   any aspiration of food, liquid or medicine can become a\n   medical emergency. Chronic sinus infections lead to\n   sepsis, which can be rapid and acute. Grievant also has\n   osteoporosis and is in danger of breaking bones. His\n   risk of injury is high because he sometimes forgets he\n   cannot walk. His short-term memory is not good and he\n   is often confused. He also has difficulty with urination\n   and elimination, which if left untreated, can result in\n   medical emergencies. Grievant has to be under constant\n   surveillance.\n   J. According to the expert witness offered by Grievant,\n   Grievant could not get the level of required nursing care\n   in a nursing home facility, including the facility sug-\n   gested by the State (Alden Lincoln Park Nursing\n   Facility). In her assessment for this hearing, the expert\n   contacted several nursing homes (including Alden) and\n   asked about the level of care provided. According to this\n   witness, none would provide the level of care need by\n   Grievant: 24 hour[s] per day by skilled clinical nurses.\n   She based her assessment on the Grievant’s medical\n\f10                                               No. 02-3657\n\n     file, her observation of Grievant, and her 20 years of\n     experience as a skilled nursing professional.\nIDPA Hearing Officer Findings ¶¶ H-J. Presented with the\nhearing officer’s factual findings and Eric’s grievance, IDPA\nDirector Ann Patla concluded that the sole issue that she\nhad the authority to resolve was whether the IDPA’s own\nrules permit the HSP to pay for an individual’s medical care\nat a level greater than the exceptional care rate. She\nconcluded that they do not. In a decision issued in August\n18, 2000, she stated: “I find that the Rules set forth do not\nallow the HSP program to pay greater than the SCM at the\nexceptional care rate in any case.” In re Appeal of Eric\nRadaszewski, Appeal No. 00-019688-HSP, Final Adminis-\ntrative Decision (IDPA Aug. 18, 2000).\n  On September 1, 2000, Radaszewski filed a complaint for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief against the IDPA director\nin federal court, asserting that a reduction in the level of\nprivate-duty nursing provided to her son at home would\nconstitute a violation of the federal Medicaid statute as well\nas a deprivation of due process in violation of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. She sought and obtained a temporary\nrestraining order obligating the IDPA to continue funding\nEric’s at-home care. However, the district court subse-\nquently denied Radaszewski’s request for a preliminary\ninjunction, concluding that Radaszewski’s complaint alleged\nno viable federal claim and that the court consequently\nlacked authority to award her preliminary injunctive relief.\nRadaszewski v. Patla, No. 00 C 5931, Order (N.D. Ill. Nov.\n7, 2000). Radaszewski appealed the preliminary injunction\nruling to this court. While that appeal was pending, HHS on\nFebruary 2, 2001, approved the amendment to Illinois’ basic\nMedicaid plan eliminating private-duty nursing as a service\nprovided under that plan. Both parties agreed that the\namendment rendered Radaszewski’s lawsuit moot. On that\nbasis, we dismissed her appeal in an unpublished order.\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                11\n\nRadaszewski v. Patla, No. 00-3929, 2 Fed.

March 8, 2001) (unpublished) (text\navailable in Westlaw).\n   Meanwhile, in December 2000, after the district court had\ndenied her motion for a preliminary injunction, Radaszewski\nfiled suit against the IDPA Director in Illinois court—\nseeking injunctive relief compelling the IDPA to fully fund\nthe cost of the private-duty nursing care that Eric required\nin order to remain at home. Each of the theories that\nRadaszewski asserted in support of this relief was premised\non state law. The state court entered a temporary injunc-\ntion requiring the IDPA to restore funding to the\nRadaszewski family sufficient to pay for 16 hours of private-\nduty nursing per day. That injunction, we are told, remains\nin effect today. Nearly one year later, the state court\ngranted Radaszewski leave to file a supplemental complaint\nwhich added, inter alia, claims under Title II of the ADA, 42\nU.S.C. § 12132, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n29 U.S.C. § 794. Radaszewski contended that the IDPA’s\nrefusal to pay for full-time private-duty nursing for Eric at\nhis home was inconsistent with the State’s duty, pursuant\nto regulations promulgated under both the ADA and Rehabil-\nitation Act, to provide care for a disabled person in the most\ncommunity-integrated setting appropriate for that person.\nBased on the newly alleged violations of federal law, the\nDirector removed the action to federal court. Radaszewski\nasked the district court to remand the case to state court.\nThe district court remanded the state-law claims alone,\nreasoning that it lacked supplemental jurisdiction over\nthose claims under Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v.\nHalderman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id.4 In essence, Radaszewski\nwas seeking to compel the State to provide services to her\nson at home that it did not otherwise provide, and this\nexceeded the scope of the State’s duty under the Rehabilitation\nAct and the ADA. “[T]he IDPA is not required to provide the\nhandicapped more coverage than the non-handicapped\nindividual to assure ‘adequate health care.’ ” Id.

In the course of that re-\nview, we accept the truth of the allegations in Radaszewski’s\n\n\n4\n  In fact, as the IDPA concedes, the HSP makes it possible for a\ndisabled person over the age of 21 to receive at least some private-\nduty nursing services at home. Although private-duty nursing\nservices have been removed from Illinois’s basic Medicaid plan, a\ndisabled individual can still access such services through the HSP\nwaiver program. However, the SCM or exceptional care rate\napproved for the individual HSP participant operates to limit the\namount of nursing care that he or she may receive. As we have\nnoted, the exceptional care rate approved for Eric would enable\nhim to receive only four or five hours of nursing per day, far less\nthan the 16 hours of daily care he received under the MFTDC\nprogram and the 24 hours per day that he and his parents cur-\nrently seek.\n\f14                                                No. 02-3657\n\ncomplaint.

Garrett explicitly\nrecognized the right of a private plaintiff to assert an ADA\nclaim for injunctive relief against a state official in federal\ncourt. 531 U.S. at 374 n.9, 121 S. Ct. at 968 n.9. The State\nconcedes, in view of Bruggeman, that Radaszewski may\nseek injunctive relief from the Director consistent with the\ndoctrine of Ex Parte Young. Bruggeman, 324 F.3d at 912-13.\nWe therefore proceed to the merits of Radaszewski’s ADA\nclaim as well as her Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n\n                              B.\n  Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against\ndisabled persons by any public entity:\n     [N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by rea-\n     son of such disability, be excluded from participation in\n     or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or\n     activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimi-\n     nation by any such entity.\n42 U.S.C. § 12132. The statute defines a “qualified individ-\nual with a disability” as one who, “with or without reason-\nable modifications to rules, policies, or practices . . . meets\nthe essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of ser-\n\fNo. 02-3657                                               15\n\nvices or the participation in programs or activities provided\nby a public entity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2). The term “public\nentity” is defined to include “any State or local govern-\nment,” as well as “any department, agency, special purpose\ndistrict or other instrumentality of a State . . . or local\ngovernment.” § 12131(1)(a)(A), (B).\n  Pursuant to Title II, the Attorney General has promul-\ngated a regulation providing that “[a] public entity shall\nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most\nintegrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified\nindividuals with disabilities.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). The\n“most integrated setting appropriate” is in turn defined as\n“a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to\ninteract with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent\npossible.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App. A, p. 450. This integration\nmandate does not impose an unqualified obligation on a\npublic agency, however. Although an agency must make\nsuch modifications as are “reasonable” in order to avoid un-\nduly segregating the disabled, it is relieved of that obli-\ngation if it can show “that making the modifications would\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\nactivity.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).\n  The Rehabilitation Act, which applies to programs receiv-\ning federal financial assistance, contains a similar\nantidiscrimination provision, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), and a\ncorresponding regulation requiring that an agency adminis-\nter its programs and activities “in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped\npersons,” 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d). The ADA’s integration\nregulation is modeled after that regulation. See Olmstead v.\nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 592, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118315\"><a href=\"/opinion/118315/olmstead-v-lc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And consistent with the ADA’s regulatory\nscheme, that integration mandate is limited by regulatory\nprovisions indicating that a recipient of federal funding\nneed not accommodate a disabled person when the proposed\n\f16                                                No. 02-3657\n\naccommodation would impose an “undue hardship” on the\nrecipient. 28 C.F.R. §§ 41.53, 42.511(c); 45 C.F.R. § 84.12(c).\n  In view of the similarities between the relevant provisions\nof the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and their implement-\ning regulations, courts construe and apply them in a\nconsistent manner.

Al-\nthough our analysis shall focus on the ADA, that analysis\napplies with equal force to Radaszewski’s Rehabilitation Act\nclaim.\n  In Olmstead, the Supreme Court, looking to the terms\nand legislative history of the ADA’s Title II, along with the\nintegration mandate reflected in its implementing regula-\ntions, held that the “unjustified institutional isolation” of a\ndisabled individual receiving medical care from a State\namounts to an actionable form of discrimination under Title\nII. 527 U.S. at 597-603, 119 S. Ct. at 2185-88. That is so,\nthe Court concluded, even in the absence of traditional\nproof that the disabled person is being treated differently\nfrom a nondisabled person who is otherwise similarly situ-\nated. Id. at 598, 119 S. Ct. at 2186.\n     Recognition that unjustified institutional isolation of\n     persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination\n     reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional place-\n     ment of persons who can handle and benefit from com-\n     munity settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions\n     that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of\n     participating in community life. Second, confinement in\n     an institution severely diminishes the everyday life\n     activities of individuals, including family relations,\n     social contacts, work options, economic independence,\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 17\n\n    educational advancement, and cultural enrichment.\n    Dissimilar treatment correspondingly exists in this key\n    respect: In order to received needed medical services,\n    persons with . . . disabilities must, because of those\n    disabilities, relinquish participation in community life\n    they could enjoy given reasonable accommodations,\n    while persons without [such] disabilities can receive the\n    medical services they need without similar sacrifice.\nId. at 600-01, 119 S. Ct. at 2187 (citations omitted). The\nplaintiffs in Olmstead were individuals with mental dis-\nabilities who had been institutionalized in state facilities.\nAlthough their treatment providers had concluded that\ntheir needs could be met in community-based programs,\ntheir placement into such programs had been delayed, and\nthe plaintiffs filed suit under Title II, seeking to compel the\nState to transfer them into a community setting. In view of\nthe integration mandate, the Court agreed with the plain-\ntiffs that a State is obliged to provide community-based\ntreatment for individuals with disabilities, so long as the\nState’s treatment professionals find that such treatment is\nappropriate, the affected individuals do not oppose\ncommunity-based treatment, and placement in the commu-\nnity can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account\nthe State’s resources and the needs of others with similar\ndisabilities. Id. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190. In a footnote, the\nCourt disavowed any intent to hold that the ADA imposes on\nthe States either a particular standard of care or a require-\nment that they provide a particular level of benefits to\ndisabled persons. Id. at 603 n.14, 119 S. Ct. at 2188 n.14.\n“We do hold, however, that States must adhere to the ADA’s\nnondiscrimination requirement with regard to the services\nthey in fact provide.” Ibid.\n  Radaszewski contends that Illinois’s unwillingness to\ncontinue funding private-duty nursing care for Eric at home\nportends precisely the type of “unjustified institutional\nisolation” for him that Olmstead described as form of\n\f18                                               No. 02-3657\n\ndiscrimination prohibited by the ADA. She asserts that Eric\nsatisfies each of the three conditions that the Court in\nOlmstead cited as prerequisites to the State’s obligation to\nprovide community-based treatment. Indeed, it appears\nthat two of these conditions—the propriety of community-\nbased care for Eric, and the consent of Eric and his affected\nfamily members—are undisputed. There is little doubt that\nEric can be cared for appropriately at home; he has been\nreceiving care at home since 1994, and according to the\ncomplaint, he benefits from the support of and interaction\nwith his parents in that environment. And obviously, neither\nhe nor his family oppose the prospect of him remaining at\nhome; that is the point of Radaszewski’s complaint. As for\nthe third condition—the State’s ability to reasonably accom-\nmodate community-based care for the disabled individual—\nRadaszewski asserts that the cost of at-home, private-duty\nnursing for Eric is actually less than what the State would\nspend if Eric were transferred to an institution. Thus,\nRadaszewski believes that the State reasonably can accom-\nmodate continued at-home care for Eric without jeopardiz-\ning its resources or interfering with the State’s obligation to\ncare for other disabled individuals. One of the ways that it\nmight do this, Radaszewski suggests, is by increasing the\ncap on the amount that the HSP will pay for the services\nthat disabled individuals need in order to remain at home.\n  The Director, on the other hand, construes Radaszewski’s\ncomplaint to require a substantive change in the services\nIDPA currently provides. Picking up on footnote 14 of the\nOlmstead opinion, the State emphasizes that the ADA does\nnot guarantee that each recipient of state medical benefits\nwill get care precisely tailored to his needs; instead, the\nstatute requires the State not to discriminate vis-à-vis\nservices that it has chosen to provide. 527 U.S. at 603 n.14,\n119 S. Ct. at 2188 n.14. Thus, post-Olmstead, courts have\nrecognized that a State may violate Title II when it refuses\nto provide an existing benefit to a disabled person that\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                19\n\nwould enable that individual to live in a more community-\nintegrated setting. E.g., Fisher v. Oklahoma Health Care\nAuth., supra, 335 F.3d at 1182-84 (State may violate Title\nII when it caps the number of drug prescriptions it will fund\nthrough Medicaid for participants in community-based care\nprograms, but not for persons who live in nursing homes);\nTownsend v. Quasim, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781887\"><a href=\"/opinion/781887/levi-townsend-v-lyle-quasim-secretary-of-the-state-of-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516-20 (9th Cir. 2003)\n(community-based long-term care offered to categorically\nneedy must be offered to medically needy as well, unless\ndoing so would fundamentally alter the State’s Medicaid\nprograms). On the other hand, courts have also held that a\nState is not obligated to create new services in order to\nenable an institutionalized individual to live in a more\nintegrated setting. E.g., Rodriguez v. City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766876\"><a href=\"/opinion/766876/juana-rodriguez-by-her-son-and-next-friend-wilfredo-rodriguez-amelia/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 615-16 (2d Cir. 1999) (neither ADA nor Rehabili-\ntation Act compelled State to offer safety monitoring to\npersons with mental disabilities so that such individuals\ncould remain at home, where safety monitoring was not an\nexisting personal care service that city offered through its\nMedicaid program).\n  Here, IDPA argues, the State’s basic Medicaid plan (by\nvirtue of the amendment approved in 2001) does not include\nprivate-duty nursing services. Of course, nursing generally\nis a service provided, but the particular service that Eric\nrequires is one-on-one, private-duty nursing. The only\nindividuals to whom that type of nursing is offered at the\nlevel that Eric requires are persons under the age of 21, who\nmay receive such services under the MFTDC waiver program.\nSee n.1, supra. Funding for private-duty nursing is avail-\nable through the HSP program, but at a level no higher\nthan the exceptional care rate—which in this case would\npermit no more than five hours of nursing per day. Thus, in\norder for Radaszewski to obtain the relief she seeks for Eric,\nthe IDPA either would have to raise the age limit for\nparticipation in the MFTDC program or raise the level of\ncare covered by the HSP by substantially increasing the\n\f20                                               No. 02-3657\n\nexceptional care rate for individuals with disabilities akin\nto Eric’s. In the State’s view, neither modification is a\nreasonable one, and either one would compel the IDPA to\nalter the substance of the services it provides to Medicaid\nrecipients and thus to offer a new service that does not\ncurrently exist.\n  A key premise of the State’s argument is that private-\nduty nursing would not be provided to Eric in the institu-\ntional setting that the IDPA believes is appropriate to his\nlevel of need—i.e., in a nursing home facility. However,\nfrom the face of the complaint, the documents in the public\nrecord relating to Eric’s IDPA grievance, and the briefing in\nthis appeal, there appear to be at least two important\nfactual questions relating to this premise that cannot be\nresolved on the pleadings.\n  The first of these questions is whether a nursing home\nfacility actually could meet Eric’s medical needs, as the\nDirector supposes. As we noted earlier, the IDPA calculated\nthe level of benefits for which Eric was eligible under the\nHSP with reference to the cost of care at a nursing home\nfacility; and the IDPA took the position that Eric would\nhave to seek care in that type of facility if HSP funding at\nthe exceptional care rate was insufficient to pay for his care\nat home. However, the Radaszewskis have consistently\nchallenged the notion that Eric could receive adequate care\nat a nursing home facility. When Eric filed a grievance with\nthe IDPA challenging the exceptional care rate that the\nDepartment had established for Eric, his parents put on\nevidence that Eric could not properly be cared for in a\nnursing home facility as the State contended, because such\na facility could not provide the constant, one-on-one care\nthat he needs in order to survive. Based on that evidence,\nwhich apparently was uncontradicted, the hearing officer\nwhose findings we quoted above specifically found that Eric\n“would be at risk of danger if he should be placed in a\nnursing home.” IDPA Hearing Officer findings ¶ H. In view\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                  21\n\nof that finding, we must assume that Radaszewski will be\nable to prove in this litigation that Eric, if institutionalized,\nwould require a more care-intensive setting than a nursing\nhome—a hospital, for example—in order to survive. That\npossibility in turn suggests that the type and cost of\nmedical care that Eric would receive at a nursing home\nfacility are not the appropriate reference points for assess-\ning whether the private-duty nursing that Eric seeks to\nreceive at home is a service that would be provided to Eric\nin an institutional setting.\n  The second question concerns the level of care that Eric\nwould require in an institutional setting—whether it be a\nnursing home facility, a hospital, or another type of care\nfacility. The State posits that Eric would not receive private\nnursing care in any institutional setting, even a hospital, so\nthat there is no institutional precedent that would support\nhis demand under Title II for private-duty nursing at home.\nCf. Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183 (“Plaintiffs are simply request-\ning that a service for which they would be eligible under an\nexisting state program, unlimited medically necessary\nprescriptions, be provided in a community-based setting\nrather than a nursing home. They are not demanding a\nseparate service or one not already offered by the state.”);\nTownsend, 328 F.3d at 517 (“Mr. Townsend simply requests\nthat the services he is already eligible to receive under an\nexisting state program . . . be provided in the community-\nbased adult home where he lives, rather than the nursing\nhome setting the state requires.”). Here again, however, the\nevidence presented to the IDPA hearing officer, and that\nofficer’s findings, suggest that Eric might well require\ncontinuous one-on-one nursing care if he were cared for in\nan institutional setting. The hearing officer’s summary of\nthe testimony provided by Eric’s caretakers, most if not all\nof which was undisputed, makes it plausible to suppose that\nEric cannot be left unattended—or attended only by a\nperson lacking significant medical skills— for any amount\n\f22                                               No. 02-3657\n\nof time. It appears from that summary that he requires\nskilled assistance in order to safely accomplish many of the\nbodily functions necessary to remain alive—drinking,\neating, eliminating waste, moving about, even breathing.\nRadaszewski may thus be able to show that if institutional-\nized, Eric would require the equivalent of the private-duty\nnursing care that, until now, he has received at home.\n  The Director concedes that if Eric were placed in an\ninstitution, the IDPA would obliged to provide him with the\nlevel of care that he needs in order to survive. So if, as the\nevidence presented to the IDPA hearing officer strongly\nsuggests, Eric requires constant monitoring and continuous\nskilled assistance in accomplishing basic bodily functions,\nthen the State will have to provide those services to Eric in\nan institutional setting. It may well be, as the Director\nrepresents, that an institutional facility would not assign\nprivate-duty nurses, as such, to provide the care that Eric\nrequires. In lieu of one nurse assigned only to Eric, for\nexample, a hospital might be able to rely on a variety of\nmonitors to keep Eric’s life signs under surveillance, while\na pool of immediately available skilled professionals tending\nto multiple patients in a care-intensive unit might be able\nto provide the frequent, immediate assistance Eric requires\nin order to eat, drink, and so on and to head off any of the\nmedical crises (e.g., choking or infections) to which he is\nvulnerable. But if what that level of care adds up to is the\nequivalent of around-the-clock, private-duty nursing care,\nthen Radaszewski may yet have a viable claim that Eric is\nentitled to receive private-duty nursing care at home.\n   Nothing in the regulations promulgated under the ADA\nor the Rehabilitation Act or in the Court’s decision in\nOlmstead conditions the viability of a Title II or section 504\nclaim on proof that the services a plaintiff wishes to receive\nin a community-integrated setting already exist in exactly\nthe same form in the institutional setting. Although a State\nis not obliged to create entirely new services or to otherwise\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 23\n\nalter the substance of the care that it provides to Medicaid\nrecipients in order to accommodate an individual’s desire to\nbe cared for at home, the integration mandate may well\nrequire the State to make reasonable modifications to the\nform of existing services in order to adapt them to com-\nmunity-integrated settings. Some forms of medical treat-\nment—for example, prescription medications—might be\nvirtually the same whether provided to the recipient in an\ninstitution or at home. See Fisher, 335 F.3d at 1183. But\nparticularly when the treatment involves services provided\nby medical professionals, the care might vary in format\ndepending on whether it is provided to the individual in an\ninstitution or a community-based setting. If variations in\nthe way services are delivered in different settings were\nenough to defeat a demand for more community-integrated\ncare, then the integration mandate of the ADA and the\nRehabilitation Act would mean very little. Of course, the\nState always has the opportunity to show that adapting\nexisting institution-based services to a community-based\nsetting would impose unreasonable burdens or fundamen-\ntally alter the nature of its programs and services, and for\nthat reason it should not be required to accommodate the\nplaintiff. 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7); see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at\n603-06, 119 S. Ct. at 2188-90. But so long as it is possible for\nthe plaintiff to show that the services he seeks to receive at\nhome are, in substance, already provided in the institu-\ntional setting, then the State is not entitled to judgment on\nthe pleadings based on the argument that the services\nwould take on a different form or method if provided in a\ncommunity setting.\n  Also relevant to the question of whether continuous\nprivate-duty nursing is a service that Illinois does not\npresently offer in any setting is the fact that IDPA can and\ndoes make available a limited amount of funding for pri-\nvate-duty nursing to adults participating in the HSP. Recall\nthat the purpose of a waiver program like HSP is to enable\nmedically needy individuals to avoid institutionalization by\n\f24                                                    No. 02-3657\n\nmaking services available to them that are otherwise not\npart of the State’s basic Medicaid program. At-home\nnursing care, which has now been removed from Illinois’s\nMedicaid plan, would constitute such a service. The cap on\nthe level of funding that HSP would provide to Eric and his\nfamily prevents him from receiving the level of private-duty\nnursing services that he needs—recall that the exceptional\ncare rate approved for Eric would pay for only four or five\nhours of private-duty nursing per day rather than the 24\nhours per day that his family seeks. But the fact that the\nState already provides for some private-duty nursing tends\nto belie the notion that providing such care to Eric so that\nhe may remain at home would require the State to alter the\nsubstance of its Medicaid programs by creating an entirely\n“new”service.\n   Insofar as the HSP is concerned, the State contends that\nEric is ineligible for that program (and that Radaszewski\ncannot plead or prove otherwise) because the cost of the\ncontinuous care that he needs admittedly exceeds the cost\nof exceptional care in a nursing facility, the latter figure\nbeing the most that IDPA, under its current rules, will pay\nfor Eric’s at-home care. That point is not dispositive of the\nfederal claims that Radaszewski has made here. It is true,\nas the Director points out, that the ADA only prohibits\ndiscrimination against “qualified individuals with disabili-\nties,” whom (as we noted earlier) the statute describes as\ndisabled individuals who “with or without reasonable modi-\nfications to rules, policies, or practices . . . mee[t] the essential\neligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the\nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public\nentity.” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601-\n02, 119 S. Ct. at 2187-88. For present purposes, it appears\nundisputed that Eric is qualified for the receipt of home\nservices through the HSP in the sense that he has severe,\nlong-term disabilities, he is eligible for Medicaid, and he is\nat risk of placement in an institutional health care facility.\nSee 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 682.100 (setting forth HSP\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                 25\n\neligibility requirements). It is also undisputed that his\nhome is an appropriate care setting for Eric—he has lived\nthere since the onset of his disabilities with the support of\nthe at-home services that he received through the MFTDC\nwaiver program until he reached the age of 21—the very\nsame services that he seeks to continue receiving as an\nadult.\n  By no means is Eric an “unqualified” disabled person in\nthe sense that Olmstead emphasized—he is not someone\nwho is “unable to handle or benefit from community set-\ntings,” 527 U.S. at 601-02; 119 S. Ct. at 2187, whom the\nState’s medical professionals believe is not able to live in a\ncommunity-integrated setting, id. at 602, 119 S. Ct. at 2188,\nor who does not want to live in a such a setting, ibid. On the\ncontrary, Radaszewski’s complaint, together with the IDPA\ngrievance records, suggest that with appropriate care Eric\ncan live at home (he has in fact done so for a number of\nyears), that he wishes to continue doing so, and that he\nprofits in that environment from the daily interaction with\nand nurturing by his parents and the access to on-line\nlearning that he has at home. Supplemental Complaint Count\nI ¶ 11, Count VI ¶¶ 40-46, Count VII ¶¶ 42-45; IDPA Hear-\ning Officer Findings ¶ A (“[Eric] has been cared [for] at\nhome for the past 5 years through funding from the Illinois\nDivision of Specialized Care for Children (DSCC). This care,\nplus the admirable efforts of his parents, has allowed\nGrievant to be cared for in his home. Grievant wishes to be\nmaintained in his home with his family; this is also his\nparents’ wish[ ].”). Eric thus appears to meet these “essential”\nrequirements for at-home care. See Townsend, 328 F.3d at\n516 (plaintiff was a “qualified individual with a disability”\nfor purposes of Title II because he was eligible to receive\nservices through State’s Medicaid program, he preferred to\nreceive such services in a community-based setting, and\ncommunity-based services were appropriate for his needs).\n  Accepting the allegations of the complaint as true, Eric is\nalso qualified for the HSP program in the sense that the\n\f26                                                  No. 02-3657\n\ncost of his continued care at home would not exceed the\nanticipated cost of caring for him in an institutional setting.\nAs we have noted, approval for Medicaid waiver programs\noffering community-based care is conditioned on certifica-\ntion that the average per-capita cost of at-home or other\ncommunity-based care does not exceed the average per-\ncapita cost of institutional care. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(D);\n42 C.F.R. § 441.302(e). In view of that federal requirement,\none of the eligibility requirements that Illinois has specified\nfor participation in the HSP program is that an individual\ndoes not require in-home services that are expected to cost\nmore than what the State would pay to provide institutional\ncare to an individual with a similar DON score. 89 Ill.\nAdmin. Code § 682.100(h). As we have noted, Radaszewski\nasserts that the cost of providing private-duty nursing care\nto Eric at home, although it exceeds the exceptional care\nrate approved for Eric by several multiples, is nonetheless\nno greater and perhaps less than what it would cost the\nState to care for Eric in an appropriate institution. We\nassume, as we must, that Radaszewski will be able to prove\nthe truth of that assertion. Her assertion is plausible,\nparticularly in view of the fact that the MFTDC program,\nthrough which Eric received funding for private-duty\nnursing until he turned 21, has a similar requirement of\ncost-neutrality. See 89 Ill. Admin. Code § 140.645(c)(3).\nConsequently, we discern no impediment concerning Eric’s\nstatus as a “qualified individual with a disability” that\nwould preclude the relief his mother seeks under Title II.\n  The cost of around-the-clock private-duty nursing care no\ndoubt is relevant to the separate question of whether re-\nquiring the State to continue providing that care for Eric at\nhome would entail reasonable modifications to IDPA’s rules\nand practices or would result in a fundamental alteration of\nthe services and programs that Illinois provides to similarly\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                      27\n\nsituated individuals.5 As we have noted, the cost of provid-\ning 24-hour private-duty nursing care to Eric at home is\nestimated at between $15,000 and $20,000 per month, an\namount three to four times greater than the exceptional\ncare rate approved for Eric. So in that respect, the State\nwould have to substantially increase the level of expendi-\ntures it would otherwise make on Eric’s behalf under the\nHSP in order to continue Eric’s at-home care. That alone\ndoes not defeat his Title II claim. See Fisher, 335 F.3d at\n1183 (“If every alteration in a program or service that\nrequired the outlay of funds were tantamount to a funda-\n\n\n5\n   The plaintiffs in Olmstead were, as we have indicated, persons\nwith mental disabilities. When it addressed the fundamental-\nalteration defense in that case, the Supreme Court spoke of the\nneed to consider the State’s obligations to other persons with the\nsame broad type of disabilities, i.e., other persons with mental\ndisabilities. See 527 U.S. at 604, 119 S. Ct. at 2189 (“Sensibly con-\nstrued, the fundamental-alteration component of the reasonable-\nmodifications regulation would allow the State to show that, in\nthe allocation of available resources, immediate relief for the\nplaintiffs would be inequitable, given the responsibility the State\nhas undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse\npopulation of persons with mental disabilities.”) (emphasis ours);\nid. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190 (“[W]e conclude that, under Title II\nof the ADA, States are required to provide community-based treat-\nment for persons with mental disabilities when the State’s treatment\nprofessionals determine that such placement is appropriate, the\naffected persons do not oppose such treatment, and the placement\ncan be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources\navailable to the State and the needs of others with mental disabili-\nties.”) (emphasis ours). It is not immediately apparent here what\nthe relevant group of disabled persons should be for purposes of\nthe fundamental-alteration defense, and this is not a matter that\nthe parties themselves have addressed in the briefing. For present\npurposes, we will refer simply to other persons with disabilities\nsimilar to Eric’s. If and when the fundamental-alteration defense\nis reached in further proceedings, the parties and the district court\nwill want to consider how to more precisely define and describe\nthat group.\n\f28                                                No. 02-3657\n\nmental alteration, the ADA’s integration mandate would be\nhollow indeed.”). Once again, however, if, as Radaszewski\nrepresents, it would cost the State no more and possibly less\nto care for Eric at home than it would to care for him in an\ninstitution, this would be highly relevant to whether the\nState is obliged under Title II to provide him with full-time,\nat-home care.\n  Olmstead did note that because a State is obliged to\nmaintain a full range of facilities in order to provide care for\nits disabled citizens, it may not always be able to fully\nrealize the cost savings of placing an individual person in a\ncommunity setting rather than an institution. 527 U.S. at\n604, 119 S. Ct. at 2189. Moving one resident of a state-\nfunded institution into the community does not necessarily\nmean that the State immediately could close or reduce the\nsize of that institution; in the short run, the State might\nincur greater costs by funding a community placement for\nthe individual who can be cared for there while continuing\nto provide institutional services for those who cannot be\ncared for in a community setting. Ibid. A court must\ntherefore take care to consider the cost of a plaintiff’s care\nnot in isolation, but in the context of the care it must\nprovide to all individuals with disabilities comparable to\nthose of the plaintiff.\n   This is not an assessment that can be made on the\npleadings in this case. The State may be able to show that\nin view of the obligations it has not just to Eric but to all\nindividuals with similar disabilities, it cannot fund a home\nplacement for Eric without fundamentally altering the care\nit provides to others with similar needs. But the evidence\nmight also show something different to be true. If the State\nwould have to pay a private facility to care for Eric, for\nexample, and the cost of that placement equaled or ex-\nceeded the cost of caring for him at home, then it would be\ndifficult to see how requiring the State to pay for at-home\ncare would amount to an unreasonable, fundamental\n\fNo. 02-3657                                                29\n\nalteration of its programs and services. Indeed, Radaszewski\nrepresents that this is precisely the case in Illinois, and\nthat, as a result, if Eric were to be cared for in an institu-\ntion, the State would be paying a private contractor to pro-\nvide that care. In any event, what matters at present is that\na much more developed record will be required in order to\nassess whether the injunctive relief that Radaszewski seeks\nwould require a fundamental alteration of the State’s pro-\ngrams and services.\n  The district court therefore erred in entering judgment on\nthe pleadings in the Director’s favor. The allegations of\nRadaszewski’s complaint permit the inference that a home\nplacement remains appropriate for Eric, that he and his\nfamily do not oppose such a placement, and that such a\nplacement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into\naccount the resources available to the State and the needs\nof others with comparable disabilities. See Olmstead, 527\nU.S. at 607, 119 S. Ct. at 2190. At the same time, the plead-\nings do not permit a finding that the injunctive relief that\nRadaszewski seeks either is unreasonable or would require\na fundamental alteration of the State’s programs and ser-\nvices for similarly-situated disabled persons. Radaszewski\nis entitled to proceed on her complaint.\n\n\n                            III.\n  For the reasons discussed, we REVERSE the judgment on\nthe pleadings entered in favor of the IDPA Director and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f30                                       No. 02-3657\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                   ________________________________\n                   Clerk of the United States Court of\n                     Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n               USCA-02-C-0072—9-8-04\n\f</pre>",
