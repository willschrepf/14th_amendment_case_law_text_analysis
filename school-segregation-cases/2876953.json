Reynolds was charged with possessing a weapon, a\n\nviolation of the Bureau of Prison’s (BOP) disciplinary code.\n\n       Reynolds was given a timely hearing before the Unit Discipline Committee and\n\nsigned the “Inmate Rights Discipline Hearing” form, opting not to have staff\n\nrepresentation or to call witnesses. After he was advised of his rights at the hearing\n\nbefore the Disciplinary Hearing Officer (DHO), Reynolds again waived staff\n\nrepresentation and chose to call no witnesses. Reynolds denied any knowledge of the\n\nweapon, stating that he had no reason to have one. The DHO reviewed the incident\n\nreport, a photograph of the seized weapon, Reynolds’s statement, and cellmate\n\nChambers’s claim that he had no knowledge of the weapon. Citing BOP policy which\n\nrequires inmates to keep their cells free of any contraband, the DHO determined that the\n\ngreater weight of the evidence supported a finding that Reynolds was partially responsible\n\nfor possessing the weapon.1 Reynolds received thirty (30) days in disciplinary\n\n\n       1\n        The DHO noted that Reynolds’s cell-mate, Chambers, was also partially\nresponsible.\n\n                                             2\n\fsegregation, a six-month loss of commissary privileges, and an additional thirty-days in\n\ndisciplinary segregation that was suspended subject to his completion of 180 days of clear\n\nconduct.\n\n       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Reynolds filed a § 2241 petition\n\nclaiming that the DHO’s finding of guilt was based on insufficient and false evidence, in\n\nviolation of his due process rights and BOP policy. He sought expungement of his prison\n\nrecord.\n\n       Upon consideration of the parties’ filings, the District Court held that the prison\n\ncomplied with due process in notifying Reynolds of his rights in accordance with Wolff\n\nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974). The District Court noted that the undisputed\n\nevidence showed that Reynolds was assigned to the cell in Unit 4B at the time of the\n\nsearch and that the BOP Program Statement 5270.007, Inmate Discipline and Special\n\nHousing Units (January 9, 2003), deemed an inmate responsible for any contraband found\n\nin his cell. Based on these facts, the District Court ruled that there was “some evidence”\n\nthat Reynolds was in constructive possession of the seized weapon, emphasizing that, in\n\ncases where only two people had access to the area in question, the principle of\n\nconstructive possession could satisfy the “some evidence” standard. The District Court\n\nrejected Reynolds’s argument that he was not guilty because BOP policy does not require\n\nhim to disassemble cell plumbing in order to comply with keeping his cell free of all\n\ncontraband. Nor did the District Court accept Reynolds’s claim that the DHO lacked\n\nsufficient evidence of guilt absent a finding that Reynolds possessed the necessary\n\n                                              3\n\fplumbing tools. The District Court denied Reynolds’s request for expungement because\n\nReynolds failed to establish that the information he sought to have expunged was, in fact,\n\nfalse. The District Court denied the petition. Reynolds filed a timely appeal.\n\n          We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). In reviewing a\n\nfederal habeas judgment, we exercise plenary review over a district court's legal\n\nconclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. See Rios v.\n\nWiley, 201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir. 2000). Although the issue in Reynolds’s appeal\n\ncontains some elements of a factual nature, the inquiry is legal in nature, and we therefore\n\nexercise plenary review over the District Court's conclusions regarding this matter. Id.\n\nUpon careful review of the record and of Reynolds’s contentions on appeal, we will\n\naffirm.\n\n          First, we must address whether Reynolds may contest his disciplinary sanctions by\n\nmeans of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. It is well-established that\n\nprison inmates possess a liberty interest in good-time credit. See Wolff v. McDonnell,\n\n418 U.S. 539, 555-57 (1974). While the Due Process Clause protects against the\n\nrevocation of good-time, it does not provide the same level of protection against the\n\nimposition of other forms of discipline. See Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141, 150-51 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (citing Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995)). Here, the DHO\n\nsanctioned Reynolds with disciplinary segregation for thirty days, a suspended term of\n\nthirty days in disciplinary segregation pending his completion of 180 days of clear\n\nconduct, and 6 months’ loss of commissary privileges. None of these sanctions invokes\n\n                                              4\n\fdue process protections. See Torres, 292 F.3d at 150-51. These punishments cannot be\n\nchallenged under § 2241 because in no manner do they affect good time credits, and thus\n\nthey have no impact on the fact or length of his sentence or confinement. See Leamer v.\n\nFauver, 288 F.3d 532, 540-42 (3d Cir. 2002). Accordingly, to the extent that Reynolds\n\nchallenges the sanctions imposed, the claim is not cognizable under § 2241.\n\n       Reynolds also claims that he has a due process right to have the disciplinary action\n\nexpunged from his record because the presence of the alleged false disciplinary finding of\n\nguilt would delay his parole eligibility. The District Court employed the test for\n\ndetermining a due process expungement claim set forth in Paine v. Baker, 595 F.2d 197\n\n(4th Cir. 1979), and denied the claim. In Paine, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held\n\nthat, in certain limited instances, a state prisoner has a federal due process right to have\n\n“prejudicial erroneous information expunged from [his] prison files” where he shows that:\n\n(1) the information is in his file, (2) the information is false, and (3) the information is\n\nrelied upon to a constitutionally significant degree. 595 F.2d at 201-202. We have not\n\ndecided whether to endorse the right of expungement announced in Paine. Even if we\n\nassume arguendo the due process right exists, we agree with the District Court that\n\nReynolds is not entitled to relief.\n\n       Reynolds argues that the finding of guilt is false because there is no evidence to\n\nsupport it. Specifically, he contends that there is no evidence that he possessed the\n\nnecessary plumbing tools to retrieve the hidden shank in the sink drain. In order to\n\ncomport with due process, the disciplinary decision had to have support, but only by\n\n                                               5\n\f“some” evidence in the record. Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454 (1985). The\n\nHill standard is minimal and does not require examination of the entire record, an\n\nindependent assessment of the credibility of witnesses, or even a weighing of the\n\nevidence. Thompson v. Owens, 889 F.2d 500, 502 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n       We agree with the District Court that some evidence existed to support the DHO’s\n\nconclusions, including the incident report, the fact that Reynolds’s cellmate did not claim\n\nownership of weapon, and the physical evidence of the seized weapon. Id. at 564-65;\n\nSuperintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. at 455-56. In the absence of direct evidence indicating\n\nan inmate’s guilt, the “some evidence” standard may be satisfied by application of the\n\nconstructive possession doctrine in limited circumstances where a small number of\n\ninmates are potentially guilty of the offense charged. See White v. Kane, 860 F.Supp.\n\n1075, 1079 n.5 (E.D. Pa. 1994), aff’d, 52 F.3d 319 (3d Cir. 1995). Here, according to the\n\ndisciplinary hearing record upon which the DHO made his determination, the only\n\nprisoners with access to the cell at the time the shank was found were Reynolds and\n\nChambers. Both denied knowledge of the shank. Both were charged. The District Court\n\nproperly denied the claim because Reynolds failed to establish that the information he\n\nsought to have expunged is false.\n\n       Reynolds asserts for the first time that fourteen inmates who had occupied the cell\n\nbefore he and Chambers were housed there could have placed the contraband in the sink\n\ndrain. Consequently, Reynolds argues, the BOP should have searched the cell and seized\n\nthe weapon before they let Reynolds and Chambers occupy it. He also disputes whether\n\n                                             6\n\fthe cell search was “routine,” contending that the officer responsible for the search was\n\nnot on duty in Unit 4B. He did not raise these allegations at any point during the prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings or in his § 2241 petition and thus, we will not consider them on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining arguments Reynolds makes on appeal\n\nand find them meritless. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\f",

See Rios v.\n\nWiley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767355\"><a href=\"/opinion/767355/francisco-rios-v-ron-wiley-warden-fpc-allenwood-ron-wiley/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 262 (3d Cir. 2000). Although the issue in Reynolds’s appeal\n\ncontains some elements of a factual nature, the inquiry is legal in nature, and we therefore\n\nexercise plenary review over the District Court's conclusions regarding this matter. Id.\n\nUpon careful review of the record and of Reynolds’s contentions on appeal, we will\n\naffirm.\n\n          First, we must address whether Reynolds may contest his disciplinary sanctions by\n\nmeans of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. It is well-established that\n\nprison inmates possess a liberty interest in good-time credit. See Wolff v. McDonnell,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555-57 (1974). While the Due Process Clause protects against the\n\nrevocation of good-time, it does not provide the same level of protection against the\n\nimposition of other forms of discipline. See Torres v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777862\"><a href=\"/opinion/777862/antonio-torres-v-william-fauver-new-jersey-commissioner-of-corrections-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150-51 (3d\n\nCir. 2002) (citing Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486 (1995)). Here, the DHO\n\nsanctioned Reynolds with disciplinary segregation for thirty days, a suspended term of\n\nthirty days in disciplinary segregation pending his completion of 180 days of clear\n\nconduct, and 6 months’ loss of commissary privileges. None of these sanctions invokes\n\n                                              4\n\fdue process protections. See Torres, 292 F.3d at 150-51. These punishments cannot be\n\nchallenged under § 2241 because in no manner do they affect good time credits, and thus\n\nthey have no impact on the fact or length of his sentence or confinement. See Leamer v.\n\nFauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777473\"><a href=\"/opinion/777473/charles-a-leamer-jr-v-william-h-fauver-william-f-plantier-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540-42 (3d Cir. 2002). Accordingly, to the extent that Reynolds\n\nchallenges the sanctions imposed, the claim is not cognizable under § 2241.\n\n       Reynolds also claims that he has a due process right to have the disciplinary action\n\nexpunged from his record because the presence of the alleged false disciplinary finding of\n\nguilt would delay his parole eligibility. The District Court employed the test for\n\ndetermining a due process expungement claim set forth in Paine v. Baker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364767\"><a href=\"/opinion/364767/frederick-robert-paine-v-ben-l-baker-supervisor-of-records-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">595</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(4th Cir. 1979), and denied the claim. In Paine, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held\n\nthat, in certain limited instances, a state prisoner has a federal due process right to have\n\n“prejudicial erroneous information expunged from [his] prison files” where he shows that:\n\n(1) the information is in his file, (2) the information is false, and (3) the information is\n\nrelied upon to a constitutionally significant degree. 595 F.2d at 201-202. We have not\n\ndecided whether to endorse the right of expungement announced in Paine. Even if we\n\nassume arguendo the due process right exists, we agree with the District Court that\n\nReynolds is not entitled to relief.\n\n       Reynolds argues that the finding of guilt is false because there is no evidence to\n\nsupport it. Specifically, he contends that there is no evidence that he possessed the\n\nnecessary plumbing tools to retrieve the hidden shank in the sink drain. In order to\n\ncomport with due process, the disciplinary decision had to have support, but only by\n\n                                               5\n\f“some” evidence in the record. Superintendent v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (1985). The\n\nHill standard is minimal and does not require examination of the entire record, an\n\nindependent assessment of the credibility of witnesses, or even a weighing of the\n\nevidence. Thompson v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532052\"><a href=\"/opinion/532052/david-thompson-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (3d Cir. 1989).\n\n       We agree with the District Court that some evidence existed to support the DHO’s\n\nconclusions, including the incident report, the fact that Reynolds’s cellmate did not claim\n\nownership of weapon, and the physical evidence of the seized weapon. Id. at 564-65;\n\nSuperintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. at 455-56. In the absence of direct evidence indicating\n\nan inmate’s guilt, the “some evidence” standard may be satisfied by application of the\n\nconstructive possession doctrine in limited circumstances where a small number of\n\ninmates are potentially guilty of the offense charged. See White v. Kane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2159317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2159317/white-v-kane/\"><span class=\"volume\">860</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1079 n.5 (E.D. Pa. 1994), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1995). Here, according to the\n\ndisciplinary hearing record upon which the DHO made his determination, the only\n\nprisoners with access to the cell at the time the shank was found were Reynolds and\n\nChambers. Both denied knowledge of the shank. Both were charged. The District Court\n\nproperly denied the claim because Reynolds failed to establish that the information he\n\nsought to have expunged is false.\n\n       Reynolds asserts for the first time that fourteen inmates who had occupied the cell\n\nbefore he and Chambers were housed there could have placed the contraband in the sink\n\ndrain. Consequently, Reynolds argues, the BOP should have searched the cell and seized\n\nthe weapon before they let Reynolds and Chambers occupy it. He also disputes whether\n\n                                             6\n\fthe cell search was “routine,” contending that the officer responsible for the search was\n\nnot on duty in Unit 4B. He did not raise these allegations at any point during the prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings or in his § 2241 petition and thus, we will not consider them on\n\nappeal.\n\n       We have thoroughly reviewed the remaining arguments Reynolds makes on appeal\n\nand find them meritless. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\f</pre>",
