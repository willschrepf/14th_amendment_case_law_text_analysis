Congress passed the Shepard-Byrd Act pursuant to its powers under\nthe Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.\nDefendants appealed, arguing that the Shepard-Byrd Act is unconstitutional.\nThey also argue that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove\nthat they attacked Johnson because of his race.

Over the next few days, both men were hired\nfor various odd jobs, including by an African-American contractor.          They\nfrequented several local missions with African-American patrons. On August\n13, 2011, the day of the assault, the two men ate a free dinner together at a\nservice known as Church Under the Bridge. Staggs and McLaughlin were the\nonly two white men to attend the service; the other participants were all African-\nAmerican. When asked at trial whether McLaughlin ever had trouble with any\nof the individuals at these services, Staggs answered, “Quite the contrary,\nactually.” After dinner Staggs and McLaughlin bought some wine, finished the\nbottle, and went in search of more alcohol. The two men were walking together\non the streets of downtown Houston just before midnight when they met Cannon\nand Kerstetter for the first time. Cannon and Kerstetter ran towards Staggs\nand McLaughlin. Staggs heard either Cannon or Kerstetter say, “See, I told you\nthem [sic] are woods.”\n      McLaughlin responded to the comment by lifting up his shirt to show the\nother men his tattoos, which included a swastika, sig runes, a bald man\npreparing to stab a head with the Star of David on it, a picture of a klansman\nstanding in flames with a swastika behind him, the motto of a group called the\nAryan Circle, and the words “white pride.” Staggs noticed Cannon had tattoos\non his face. He also noticed “little lightning bolts” tattooed on the back of\n\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543       Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\nKerstetter’s fingers.\n      A gang tattoo expert would later testify that “wood” is a term commonly\nused by members of white-supremacy organizations to describe themselves or\nother white people. The term is not affiliated with a particular group or\norganization but more generally signals “pride in the [w]hite race.” The expert\nalso testified that the lightning bolts tattoos on Cannon’s body are known as “sig\nrunes” or “SS bolts” and refer to the insignia adopted by the Schutzstaffel, or\nSS—a political and racial organization in Nazi Germany.                Cannon and\nKerstetter introduced themselves, and the four men shook hands and exchanged\nnames.    The three Defendants and Staggs then set off together to find more\nalcohol. At no point did the men discuss racial minorities, or make any plans to\nattack anyone.\n      Johnson, an African-American, was sitting alone at a bus stop, waiting to\ngo home after spending the day with his daughter to celebrate her birthday.\nJohnson was an amateur heavyweight boxer and former Golden Glove\nparticipant. He stood six feet, four inches tall and weighed over 200 pounds.\nJohnson had just finished talking to his daughter on the phone when he heard\nand saw the three Defendants and Staggs “coming around the corner with their\nshirts off, bald heads, loud and rowdy.” Johnson later testified that he had not\nmet any of the four men before that night.\n      According to Johnson, Cannon asked him, “Yo, bro, do you have the time?”\nAt that point Johnson looked up and noticed that Cannon was covered in tattoos.\nJohnson recognized some of the small lightning bolt tattoos on Cannon as white-\nsupremacist “Nazi” symbols. Johnson testified that he responded, “No.” One\nof the other men then said to Cannon. “Why did you call that ni--er a ‘bro’? You\nain’t supposed to call no ni--er a ‘bro.’”\n      “What did he say?” Johnson responded, to which Cannon answered, “You\nheard him, ‘ni--er.’ He called you a ‘ni--er,’ ‘ni--er.’”\n\n                                             3\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543      Page: 4    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\n       Johnson testified that the four men surrounded him. He stood up with his\nback against the pole and put up his guard. Cannon flashed a smile and swung\na punch at Johnson. Johnson weaved, dodged the blow, and swung back, hitting\nCannon. According to Johnson, all four men jumped in and started punching\nJohnson. Someone grabbed Johnson by the ankles, and Johnson fell to the\nground. One of the men lay on top of Johnson while the others stomped on his\nhead. At some point, the men stopped battering Johnson and walked away.\n       Staggs, who testified as a government witness, told a slightly different\nversion of the encounter.1 According to Staggs, he watched from twenty to thirty\nfeet away while McLaughlin and Cannon spoke to Johnson. He could not hear\ntheir conversation, and did not hear any of the men use racial slurs. Staggs\ntestified that a few seconds later, Johnson appeared mad, jumped up, and\nstarted boxing with Cannon. Johnson was getting the better of Cannon, so\nMcLaughlin grabbed Johnson around the waist to try to pull him off of Cannon.\nA few moments later Kerstetter, who had been standing with Staggs, ran over\nand joined the fight. Staggs did not think the fight was very serious and saw no\nreason to get involved. He testified that “there was only one mad person; and\nthe other guys appeared to be trying to get away.” Staggs did not see anyone\nstomp on Johnson. Instead, he testified that as soon as they succeeded in getting\nJohnson down on the ground, the three Defendants immediately ran away from\nhim.\n           Soon after, Johnson pulled himself up. He ran after the four men, and\neventually caught up with Staggs. Johnson punched Staggs, and Staggs fell.\nJohnson turned around, and threw another punch to knock a second member of\nthe group to the ground. The other two men charged at Johnson, and knocked\nJohnson down for the second time. The two men whom Johnson had punched\n\n       1\n        The government agreed to dismiss the charges against Staggs in exchange for his\ntestimony at trial.\n\n                                          4\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nto the ground got up and joined the other members of the group. At that point,\nLorie Garcia—a witness who passed the scene while she was driving in the car\nwith her husband—testified that she saw four white men surrounding a black\nman, and that two of them were punching him. She immediately called 911.\n      Meanwhile, Staggs and the three Defendants had walked away for a\nsecond time and left Johnson on the ground. Johnson again pulled himself up\nand picked up a sandbag. He tried to throw it at the four men, but found that\nit was too heavy. He dropped it and did not pursue the men. Several police cars\nquickly arrived at the scene. The first few police cars drove past Johnson. As\nthey did so, Johnson pointed to the direction in which the four men had run off.\nAnother police car then stopped by Johnson to control the scene. Johnson’s face\nwas swelling and bleeding heavily. His body was bruised, and he staggered as\nhe walked. The police eventually detained Staggs and the three Defendants. The\njury heard live and video deposition testimony from officers that Cannon and\nMcLaughlin were agitated upon being detained and used racial slurs when they\nwere arrested—including the word “ni--er” to refer to responding officers who\nwere African-American.\n      Defendants were initially charged in Harris County, Texas, with\nmisdemeanor assault. These state law misdemeanor charges were dropped after\nthe prosecution brought federal hate crime charges against Defendants. A\nfederal grand jury in the Southern District of Texas returned a one-count\nindictment charging Defendants with a violation of § 249(a)(1) of the Shepard-\nByrd Act. Specifically, the federal indictment alleged that “while aiding and\nabetting each other,” Defendants “willfully caused bodily injury to [Johnson],\nwho is African-American, because of his actual or perceived race, color, and\nnational origin.” McLaughlin and Cannon filed pre-trial motions to dismiss the\nindictment, arguing that § 249(a)(1) is an invalid exercise of congressional power\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment.          The government filed a response in\n\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543     Page: 6   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\nopposition, and the district court denied Defendants’ motions.\n         Defendants moved for judgments of acquittal at the end of the\ngovernment’s evidence, and again at the close of all evidence. The district court\ndenied both motions. The jury returned a guilty verdict against all three\nDefendants. Defendants then filed motions for a judgment of acquittal or a new\ntrial, again arguing that § 249(a)(1) was invalid under the Thirteenth\nAmendment and that the prosecution had not met its burden in proving that\nthey caused bodily injury to Johnson because of his actual or perceived race. The\ndistrict court denied the motions and entered a final judgment. The district\ncourt then sentenced Cannon to thirty-seven months of imprisonment,\nMcLaughlin to thirty months of imprisonment, and Kerstetter to seventy-seven\nmonths of imprisonment. The district court also sentenced each Defendant to\na three-year term of supervised release and a mandatory special assessment of\n$100. Defendants timely appealed.\n                                         II.\n         Defendants challenge the constitutionality of § 249(a)(1) of the Shepard-\nByrd Act, arguing that it is not a valid exercise of Congress’s power under § 2 of\nthe Thirteenth Amendment. Because we are bound by the Supreme Court’s\nprecedent and our prior precedent in this area, we conclude that § 249(a)(1) is\nvalid.\n         We review the constitutionality of federal statutes de novo. United States\nv. Portillo–Munoz, 643 F.3d 437, 439 (5th Cir. 2011).          Defendants do not\nchallenge the constitutionality of the entire Shepard-Byrd Act. Instead, they\nchallenge only § 249(a)(1), which applies to hate crimes motivated by religion\nnational origin, race, or color. It provides:\n         Offenses involving actual or perceived race, color, religion, or\n         national origin.—Whoever, whether or not acting under color of\n         law, willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use\n         of fire, a firearm, a dangerous weapon, or an explosive or\n\n                                          6\n\f     Case: 12-20514        Document: 00512607543         Page: 7     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\n           incendiary device, attempts to cause bodily injury to any person,\n           because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, or national\n           origin of any person— (A) shall be imprisoned not more than 10\n           years, fined in accordance with this title, or both.\n18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(1)(A).2 Section 249(a)(1) is distinct from the second part of the\nShepard-Byrd Act, which applies to other categories of hate crimes, and rests on\ndifferent constitutional sources of congressional authority.3 Congress passed\n§ 249(a)(2) under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Commerce Clause.\nIn contrast, § 249(a)(1) rests solely on Congress’s authority under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment.4 Section 1 of the Thirteenth Amendment provides:\n“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime\nwhereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United\nStates, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” U.S. Const. amend. XIII, § 1.\nSection 2 states that “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by\nappropriate legislation.” Id. § 2.\n       In order to determine whether § 249(a)(1) is a valid exercise of\ncongressional power under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment, we begin by\nlooking at the Supreme Court’s Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence. The\nSupreme Court decided the Civil Rights Cases—five consolidated cases\nimplicating the denial of public accommodations to African-Americans—shortly\nafter the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment. 109 U.S. 3 (1883). There, the\nSupreme Court held that Congress could not rely on its enforcement power\nunder § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment to enact public-accommodation\n\n\n       2\n         Section 249(a)(1)(B) provides separate penalties if the offense results in death, or\ninvolves an attempt to kidnap, kill, or commit aggravated sexual abuse.\n       3\n        See 18 U.S.C. § 249(a)(2) (covering perceived religion, national origin, gender, sexual\norientation, gender identity, or disability).\n       4\n        Even though Johnson was waiting at a bus station at the time the altercation began\nneither party argues that this case implicates interstate commerce.\n\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543      Page: 8   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nprovisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Id. Specifically, the Supreme Court\nreasoned that discrimination in public accommodations had “nothing to do with\nslavery or involuntary servitude,” and therefore fell outside the scope of the\nThirteenth Amendment. Id. at 24.\n      Although the Supreme Court found the connection between the denial of\npublic accommodation and slavery too attenuated for purposes of the Thirteenth\nAmendment, it also stated in dicta that the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment\nextended beyond abolishing laws or private acts that perpetuated slavery or\ninvoluntary servitude in a literal sense. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\n      It is true that slavery cannot exist without law any more than\n      property in lands and goods can exist without law, and therefore the\n      Thirteenth Amendment may be regarded as nullifying all State laws\n      which establish or uphold slavery. But it has a reflex character\n      also, establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom\n      throughout the United States; and it is assumed that the power\n      vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,\n      clothes Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper\n      for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United\n      States.\nId. at 16 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court did not clearly delineate the\nscope of “badges” and “incidents” of slavery. Scholars have observed that the\nSupreme Court interpreted this phrase far more narrowly in the past than it\ndoes today. See, e.g., Jack M. Balkin & Sanford Levinson, The Dangerous\nThirteenth Amendment, 112 Colum. L. Rev. 1459, 1469 (2012) (noting that the\nterm “‘badges or incidents of slavery,’ a term taken from the 1883 Civil Rights\nCases . . . had construed Congress’s [enforcement] powers [under the Thirteenth\nAmendment] far more narrowly”).\n      Twenty-three years later in Hodges v. Unites States, 203 U.S. 1 (1906), the\nSupreme Court held that the Thirteenth Amendment did not provide Congress\nwith the power to outlaw private parties’ interference with the right to make or\nenforce a contract based on race. The Supreme Court overturned the convictions\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 9   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nof several white men for threatening and harassing African-American workers\nat a sawmill. In doing so, the Supreme Court explained that “it was not the\nintent of the [Thirteenth] Amendment to denounce every act done to an\nindividual which was wrong if done to a free man, and yet justified in a condition\nof slavery, and to give authority to Congress to enforce such denunciation.” Id.\nat 19. Instead, the Supreme Court explained that the meaning of the Thirteen\nAmendment’s grant of authority is “as clear as language can make it. The things\ndenounced are slavery and involuntary servitude, and Congress is given power\nto enforce that denunciation. All understand by these terms a condition of\nenforced compulsory service of one to another.” Id. at 16. The Supreme Court\nrefused to extend its interpretation of congressional power beyond that point,\nexplaining that\n      prior to the three post bellum amendments to the Constitution the\n      national government had no jurisdiction over a wrong like that\n      charged in this indictment is conceded; that the 14th and 15th\n      Amendments do not justify the legislation is also beyond dispute, for\n      they, as repeatedly held, are restrictions upon state action, and no\n      action on the part of the state is complained of. Unless, therefore,\n      the 13th Amendment vests in the nation the jurisdiction claimed,\n      the remedy must be sought through state action and in state\n      tribunals . . . . Notwithstanding the adoption of these three\n      amendments, the national government still remains one of\n      enumerated powers . . . . True, the 13th Amendment grants certain\n      specified and additional power to Congress, but any congressional\n      legislation directed against individual action which was not\n      warranted before the 13th Amendment must find authority in it.\nId. at 14–16.\n      This interpretation changed in 1968. In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., the\nSupreme Court adopted a broader view of the terms “badges” and “incidents” of\nslavery under the Thirteenth Amendment. 392 U.S. 409 (1968). All parties\nagree that Jones is the logical starting point for our constitutional analysis in\nthis case. In Jones, the owners of a suburban St. Louis subdivision refused to\n\n\n                                        9\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 10   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nsell a home to a potential buyer solely because he was African-American. Id. at\n412. Jones filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1982, which provides, “All citizens of the\nUnited States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\nconvey real and personal property.” 42 U.S.C. § 1982. The seller argued that\n§ 1982 was unconstitutional to the extent that it applied to purely private\nconduct, rather than to state action. 392 U.S. at 429–36. The Supreme Court\ndisagreed, concluding that Congress had the authority under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment to enact the law. Id. at 413. Specifically, the Supreme\nCourt held that the scope of Congress’s Thirteenth Amendment enforcement\npower was not limited to measures intended to end structures of slavery in a\nliteral or a formal sense. Instead, the Supreme Court held that Congress has the\nauthority to enact legislation necessary to abolish the “badges” and “incidents”\nof slavery, as well as the power to rationally determine what those “badges” and\n“incidents” are. Id. at 440–44. The Supreme Court explained that courts should\nonly invalidate legislation enacted under the Thirteenth Amendment if they\nconclude that Congress made an irrational determination in deciding what\nconstitutes “badges” and “incidents” of slavery in passing legislation to address\nthem. See id. at 439–43.\n      We applied the Supreme Court’s approach in United States v. Bob\nLawrence Realty, Inc., 474 F.2d 115 (5th Cir. 1973). In Bob Lawrence Realty, our\ncourt concluded that § 3604(e) of the Fair Housing Act fell “within the\nconstitutional authority of Congress to enact legislation to enforce the\nThirteenth Amendment.” Id. at 117. As we explained,\n      We think that the mandate of Jones is clear. This Court will give\n      great deference, as indeed it must, to the congressional\n      determination that § 3604(e) will effectuate the purpose of the\n      Thirteenth Amendment by aiding in the elimination of the “badges\n      and incidents of slavery in the United States.” Jones v. Mayer Co.,\n\n\n                                       10\n\f   Case: 12-20514         Document: 00512607543          Page: 11      Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\n      supra, 392 U.S. at 439 . . . . Appellants have failed to present any\n      argument that impugns the reasonableness of the congressional\n      determination. Indeed, no such argument can be made in light of\n      the role that blockbusting plays in creating and in perpetuating\n      segregated housing patterns and thus in preventing “. . . a dollar in\n      the hands of a Negro . . . [from purchasing] the same thing as a\n      dollar in the hands of a white man.” Jones v. Mayer Co., supra, 392\n      U.S. at 443; see also, Note, Discriminatory Housing Markets, Racial\n      Unconscionability, and Section 1988: The ‘Contract Buyers League’\n      Case, 80 Yale L. J. 516 (1971). We find that the Thirteenth\n      Amendment empowers Congress to enact § 3604(e).\nId. at 120–21.\n      In enacting the Shepard-Byrd Act, Congress set forth ten findings to\nprovide a basis for the Act in its entirety, including an explicit finding that\n“eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means of eliminating,\nto the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and\ninvoluntary servitude.” Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes\nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123 Stat. 2190 (2009), div. E., § 4702\n(codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. § 249) (emphasis added).5 Congress also\n\n      5\n          The other relevant Congressional Findings include the following:\n      (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color\n      . . . of the victim poses a serious national problem.\n      ...\n      (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were\n      defined by the race, color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and\n      involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of the\n      13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, through widespread\n      public and private violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or\n      ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially\n      motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the extent possible,\n      the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n      (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the\n      Constitution of the United States were adopted, and continuing to date,\n      members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are perceived\n      to be distinct “races”. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, the\n      badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on\n      the basis of real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent\n\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543         Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20514\n\ncompiled statistics regarding the prevalence of hate crimes in American society\nand the need for expanded federal jurisdiction over the problem. See H.R. Rep.\nNo. 111-86, Pt. 1, at 5–6 (2009). Both the Supreme Court and our own precedent\nafford Congress ample deference in defining what private actions qualify as\n“badges” and “incidents” of slavery. See Jones, 392 U.S. at 440; Bob Lawrence\nRealty, Inc., 474 F.2d at 120. Under our Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence,\nwe must respect Congress’s determination unless it lacks a rational basis.\n       In order to determine whether racially motivated violence is rationally\nconsidered one of the “badges” or “incidents” of slavery, we must first examine\nwhat those terms mean. The words “badges” and “incidents” were originally\nterms of art with specific meanings tied to their historical context.\n       An incident of slavery, as that term was used, was any legal right\n       or restriction that necessarily accompanied the institution of\n       slavery. Most often, “incident” was used to refer to the aspects of\n       property law that applied to the ownership and transfer of slaves.\n       It also was used to refer to the civil disabilities imposed on slaves by\n       virtue of their status as property. In all, the term has clear, finite,\n       historically determined meaning. It refers to a closed set of public\n       laws that applied in the antebellum slaveholding states. Identifying\n       an “incident of slavery,” then, is an exercise in historical inquiry.\nJennifer Mason McAward, Defining the Badges and Incidents of Slavery, 14 U.\nPa. J. Const. L. 561, 575 (2012).\n       While the definition of badge has broadened over time, “in its most general\nsense, the term ‘badge of slavery’ . . . refers to indicators, physical or otherwise,\nof African-Americans’ slave or subordinate status.” Id. at 575. Before the Civil\nWar, the term referred to skin color. After the War, it came to mean the kinds\n\n\n\n       such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the\n       adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the\n       United States.\nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123\nStat. 2190 (2009), div. E., § 4702 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. § 249) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             12\n\f    Case: 12-20514        Document: 00512607543          Page: 13     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\nof legal restrictions, such as the Black Codes, that were imposed on African-\nAmericans to try to enforce inferior status on them. After the end of Black\nCodes, it came to mean “less formal but equally virulent means—including\nwidespread violence and discrimination, disparate enforcement of racially\nneutral laws, and eventually, Jim Crow laws—to keep the freed slaves in an\ninferior status.” Id. at 581–82.6\n       As the Tenth Circuit explained in its opinion holding that § 249(a)(1) is a\nvalid exercise of Congress’s power under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment:\n       Congress could rationally conclude that physically attacking a\n       person of a particular race because of animus toward or a desire to\n       assert superiority over that race is a badge or incident of slavery.\n       The antebellum North Carolina Supreme Court, for example,\n       characterized unrestrained master-on-slave violence as one of\n       slavery’s most necessary features. State v. Mann, 13 N.C. (2 Dev.)\n       263, 1829 WL 252, at *2–3. “[U]ncontrolled authority over the\n       body,” it said, is the only thing “which can operate to produce” a\n       slave’s necessary obedience. Id. at *2. “The power of the master\n       must be absolute, to render the submission of the slave perfect.” Id.;\n       see also United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 189 (2d Cir. 2002)\n       (“slavery in general . . . centrally involved the master’s constant\n       power to use private violence against the slave”); Neal v. Farmer, 9\n\n       6\n        Although there may be concern with the scope of Congress’s power under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment, none of these definitions suggests that Congress can alter and expand\nthe meaning of these terms to also cover any racially motivated activities that it wants to\nregulate.\n       As one commentator explains,\n       The concept of the “badges and incidents of slavery” is meant to assist Congress\n       in identifying ways in which it can fulfill that promise and, at the same time,\n       to mark the outer boundaries of the Section 2 power. Indeed, the terms “badge”\n       and “incident” are terms of art that refer to specific aspects of the slave system\n       and its legacy. To suggest that Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment confers\n       on Congress a broad power to legislate against discrimination generally\n       overlooks this precise terminology and tends to devalue the immediate\n       aftermath of the slave system, in which governments and individuals alike\n       sought to achieve the de facto reenslavement of four million African Americans.\nMcAward, supra, at 566.\n\n\n                                              13\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543          Page: 14     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\n       Ga. 555, 1851 WL 1474, at *8 (stating that being “liable to beating\n       . . . and every species of chastisement” were “incidents of slavery”);\n       George M. Stroud, A Sketch of the Laws Relating to Slavery 31, 38\n       (2d ed. 1856) (listing among the “incidents” of slavery, “[t]he master\n       may, at his discretion, inflict any punishment on the person of his\n       slave”); Rutherglen, State Action, at 1399 (“the principal feature of\n       the law of slavery was the ‘master’s justice’ over his slaves, who had\n       virtually no legal protection from the master’s decision to discipline\n       and punish”). Just as master-on-slave violence was intended to\n       enforce the social and racial superiority of the attacker and the\n       relative powerlessness of the victim, Congress could conceive that\n       modern racially motivated violence communicates to the victim that\n       he or she must remain in a subservient position, unworthy of the\n       decency afforded to other races.\nUnited States v. Hatch, 722 F.3d 1193, 1206 (10th Cir. 2013), cert. denied,\n13-6765, 2014 WL 1124872 (Mar. 24, 2014).\n       In conclusion, racially motivated violence was essential to the enslavement\nof African-Americans and was widely employed after the Civil War in an attempt\nto return African-Americans to a position of de facto enslavement. In light of\nthese facts, we cannot say that Congress was irrational in determining that\nracially motivated violence is a badge or incident of slavery.\n       Defendants argue that subsequent Supreme Court decisions related to the\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments cast doubts on the continued viability\nof Jones, or show that Jones should be limited. Defendants assertions are not\nfrivolous, as our sister circuit noted when addressing many of these same\narguments.      See Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1201–05 (discussing the defendant’s\nfederalism arguments and noting that “[a]t its core, Hatch’s argument raises\nimportant concerns we share”).7 Defendants argue that Jones gives Congress a\n\n       7\n         The only two circuits to address this issue have both determined that § 249(a)(1) is\na valid exercise of congressional authority. See United States v. Maybee, 687 F.3d 1026 (8th\nCir. 2012); Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1209. In Hatch, the Tenth Circuit offers an extensive discussion\nof the possibly implications of the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions on other\nconstitutional issues. See Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1201–05. In Maybee the Eighth Circuit noted\nthat\n\n                                              14\n\f    Case: 12-20514        Document: 00512607543           Page: 15      Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                        No. 12-20514\n\nunique ability to define the scope of its own powers under § 2 of the Thirteenth\nAmendment. In Jones, the Supreme Court explained that “[s]urely Congress has\nthe power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are\nthe badges and the incidents of slavery.” Id. at 440; see also Hatch, 722 F.3d at\n1200 (“In sum, after these cases the Thirteenth Amendment can be seen as\ntreating most forms of racial discrimination as badges and incidents of slavery,\nand that Congress not only has the power to enforce the amendment, but also to\na certain extent to define its meaning.”).\n       Defendants and Amici8 argue that allowing Congress to define the scope\nof its own authority is an extraordinary measure that appears to be at odds with\nthe Supreme Court’s Fourteenth Amendment precedent. Defendants and Amici\npoint to the textual similarities between § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment and\n§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, arguing that the Supreme Court would apply\nthe “congruence and proportionality” test announced in City of Boerne v. Flores,\n521 U.S. 507 (1997), and its progeny to the Thirteenth Amendment’s § 2.9 As the\n\n\n       Maybee raises a single and quite narrow challenge to the constitutionality of\n       § 249(a)(1) . . . that the willful infliction of the injury be motivated both by the\n       victim’s race and by the victim’s enjoyment of a public benefit—in finding a\n       sufficient basis to uphold § 245(b)(2)(B), these cases held that both elements are\n       necessary to justify the exercise of Congress’s Thirteenth Amendment\n       enforcement power.\n687 F.3d at 1031. The Eighth Circuit then explained that “Maybee provides no reason why\na finding of constitutional sufficiency of a statute based on two elements establishes a\nprecedent that both elements are necessary to avoid constitutional infirmity.” Id. Given this\nnarrow challenge, the Eight Circuit’s decision in Maybee does not provide as thorough of an\nanalysis of the possible constitutional issues with § 249(a)(1) as the Tenth Circuit does.\n       8\n         Todd Gaziano, Gail Heriot, and Peter Kirsanow (“Amici”) are three members of the\neight-member U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a federal commission charged with the\nresponsibility of advising the President, Congress, and the American people on issues of civil\nrights. Amici filed briefing solely in their capacities as private citizens and not as Commission\nrepresentatives.\n       9\n         The petitioner and Amici raised many of these same arguments in their petitions for\ncertiorai in Hatch.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543      Page: 16    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nSupreme Court explained in Flores:\n      Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what\n      the right is. It has been given the power “to enforce,” not the power\n      to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not\n      so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any\n      meaningful sense, the “provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].”\n521 U.S. at 519. The Supreme Court further warned that\n      If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth\n      Amendment’s meaning, no longer would the Constitution be\n      “superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.” It\n      would be “on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other\n      acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.”\n      Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that\n      would limit congressional power.\nId. at 529 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).\n      Defendants and Amici argue that under the interpretation of the\nThirteenth Amendment found in Jones, Congress has just such a power to alter\nthe Thirteenth Amendment’s meaning because it can define “badges” and\n“incidents” of slavery. Defendants argue that under the Supreme Court’s\nexisting Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence, it has become difficult to\n“conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power.” Id. As the Tenth\nCircuit explained in Hatch:\n      Badges and incidents of slavery, taken at face value, puts emphasis\n      solely on the conduct Congress seeks to prohibit, and it seems to\n      place few limits on what that conduct might be. Given slaves’\n      intensely deplorable treatment and slavery’s lasting effects, nearly\n      every hurtful thing one human could do to another and nearly every\n      disadvantaged state of being might be analogized to slavery—and\n      thereby labeled a badge or incident of slavery under Jones’s rational\n      determination test. In effect, this interpretation gives Congress the\n      power to define the meaning of the Constitution—a rare power\n      indeed.\n722 F.3d at 1204. Amici further argue that this judicial deference to Congress’s\ninterpretation of the scope of its power is at odds with the principle set forth in\n\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543         Page: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-20514\nMcCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. 316, 421 (1819), which requires deference to the\nmeans that Congress uses to achieve a particular end, but not to Congress’s\ndetermination that the end itself is legitimate.10\n       Defendants and Amici point to the textual similarities between § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment and § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, arguing that the\nSupreme Court would apply the “congruence and proportionality” test\nannounced in Flores, and its progeny to the Thirteenth Amendment’s § 2.11 They\nargue that § 249(a)(1) cannot pass that test because the law’s “sweeping\ncoverage” encompasses a number of crimes that have long been the exclusive\ndomain of the states.\n       Defendants and Amici also argue that this expansive reading of\ncongressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment is no longer appropriate\nin light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Shelby County. v. Holder, 133\nS. Ct. 2612, 2623 (2013).12 In Shelby County the Supreme Court invalidated\n§ 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which prescribed a formula for identifying the\njurisdictions covered by § 5’s preclearance requirement. See 42 U.S.C. 1973c &\n1973b(b). The Supreme Court addressed the scope of Congress’s power under § 2\nof the Fifteenth Amendment to pass “appropriate legislation” enforcing that\nAmendment’s protections on the right to vote, and explained that Congress must\n\n\n\n       10\n          Amici also argue that Jones was part of a trio of cases including Katzenbach v.\nMorgan, 384 U.S. 641(1966) (discussing the Fourteenth Amendment) and South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. 301(1966)(discussing the Fifteenth Amendment) that gave considerable\ndeference to Congress when it exercises its powers under the Reconstruction Amendments.\nAmici argue that the Supreme Court has since cut back on the deference given to Congress in\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, and that the approach used in Flores should be applied in this case.\n       11\n        The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments are collectively known as\nthe Reconstruction Amendments.\n       12\n         The Tenth Circuit decided Hatch only a few days after the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Shelby County; Hatch does not address how Shelby County impacts the proper\ninterpretation of the scope of § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment.\n\n                                            17\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543        Page: 18    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-20514\njustify the Voting Right Act’s “extraordinary measures” based on current, rather\nthan past, conditions. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2625–31. The Supreme\nCourt then concluded:\n      Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions.\n      Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that\n      exceptional conditions still exist justifying such an extraordinary\n      departure from the traditional course of relations between the\n      States and the Federal Government. Our country has changed, and\n      while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress\n      must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem\n      speaks to current conditions.\nId. at 2631 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n      Even if the legal landscape regarding the Reconstruction Amendments has\nchanged in light of Shelby County and Flores, absent a clear directive from the\nSupreme Court, we are bound by prior precedents. See Rodriguez de Quijas v.\nShearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this\nCourt has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in\nsome other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which\ndirectly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\ndecisions.”).   For this same reason, Defendants and Amici’s arguments based\non McCulloch is also foreclosed. As the Tenth Circuit explained in Hatch, “even\nif we assume Hatch’s authorities impliedly undermine Jones’s approach to the\nThirteenth Amendment, we may not blaze a new constitutional trail simply on\nthat basis.” Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1204. Shelby County never mentioned the\nThirteenth Amendment or Jones—rather, the analysis focused on the Fifteenth\nAmendment and the Voting Rights Act. Flores likewise never mentioned the\nThirteenth Amendment or Jones, and did not hold that the “congruence and\nproportionality” standard was applicable beyond the Fourteenth Amendment.13\n\n\n      13\n        Amici argue that even under Jones, § 249(a)(1) is still unconstitutional because\nCongress never purported to address slavery when enacting it. Accordingly to Amici, under\n\n                                           18\n\f    Case: 12-20514          Document: 00512607543          Page: 19     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-20514\nWe therefore continue to follow the Supreme Court’s binding precedent in Jones.\nAs explained above, § 249(a)(1) is a valid exercise of congressional power because\nCongress could rationally determine that racially motivated violence is a badge\nor incident of slavery.\n                                               III.\n       Because we conclude that § 249(a)(1) is constitutional, we now turn to the\nquestion of whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support\nDefendants’ convictions. We conclude that it was. Section 249(a)(1) lists the\nessential elements of a hate crime motivated by race or color under the Shepard-\nByrd Act. In the context of this case, § 249(a)(1) required Defendants to: (1)\nwillfully cause or attempt to cause; (2) bodily injury to any person; (3) because\nof their actual or perceived race or color.14\n       Cannon and McLaughlin only challenge the sufficiency-of-the-evidence as\nto the final element, arguing that there was insufficient proof that they were\nmotivated by Johnson’s race or color when inflicting his injuries. Because\nCannon and McLaughlin properly preserved their challenges to the sufficiency-\n\n\n\n\nJones, legislation passed under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment may be “somewhat\nprophylactic in nature,” but its end goal must still be to prevent slavery. In essence, Amici\nargue that Congress may outlaw badges and incidents of slavery only insofar as those badges\nand incidents are being used to support the institution or reestablishment of slavery, and not\nfor any other purpose. Amici argue that § 249(a)(1) thus fails under the standard set forth in\nFlores, because its ban is not congruent and proportional to the actual problem of slavery. 521\nU.S. at 520.\n        We do not read Jones as narrowly as Amici suggest. In Jones, the Supreme Court\nexplained that, pursuant to its powers under the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress can\nlegislate to address not only practices that support the institution of slavery, but also “vestiges\nof slavery” and “the relic[s] of slavery.” 392 U.S. at 441 n.78, 443. Under Jones, Congress\ncould rationally determine that racially motivated violence is a “badge” or “incident” of slavery.\nSection 249(a)(1) is thus a valid exercise of congressional power. In reaching this conclusion,\nwe are in keeping with our two sister circuits who have addressed the constitutional validity\nof § 249(a)(1). See Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1209; Maybee, 687 F.3d at 1031.\n       14\n            The parties agree that religion and national origin are not at issue in this case.\n\n                                                19\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543         Page: 20     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20514\nof-the-evidence, we review their claims de novo.15 United States v. Grant, 683\nF.3d 639, 642 (5th Cir. 2012).\n       Our review of the sufficiency-of-the-evidence is “highly deferential to the\nverdict.” United States v. Harris, 293 F.3d 863, 869 (5th Cir. 2002).\n       The standard of review for determining whether there was sufficient\n       evidence to convict a defendant is whether the evidence, when\n       reviewed in the light most favorable to the government with all\n       reasonable inferences and credibility choices made in support of a\n       conviction, allows a rational fact finder to find every element of the\n       offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence is viewed in the\n       light most favorable to the verdict, accepting all credibility choices\n       and reasonable inferences made by the trier of fact which tend to\n       support the verdict.\nUnited States v. Asibor, 109 F.3d 1023, 1030 (5th Cir. 1997) (internal citations\nomitted); see also United States v. Delgado, 672 F.3d 320, 329 (5th Cir. 2012) (en\nbanc). “It is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis\nof innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.”\nUnited States v. Lage, 183 F.3d 374, 382 (5th Cir. 1999). However, “a verdict\nmay not rest on mere suspicion, speculation, or conjecture, or on an overly\nattenuated piling of inference on inference.” Delgado, 672 F.3d at 362 (citations\nand internal quotations omitted). “[A]ny conflicts in the evidence must be\nresolved in favor of the verdict.” United States v. Duncan, 919 F.2d 981, 990 (5th\nCir. 1990).\n                                            A.\n       As a threshold matter, the fact that Johnson, not Cannon, was the first\nperson to inflict bodily injury on someone else during the fight does not render\nthe evidence insufficient to support the conviction. By its own terms, § 249(a)(1)\n\n       15\n          Kerstetter waived this claim, as he did not raise it on appeal. See Fed. R. App. P.\n28(a)(9)(A); see also Sama v. Hannigan, 669 F.3d 585, 589 (5th Cir. 2012) (“It has long been\nthe rule in this circuit that any issues not briefed on appeal are waived.” (quoting United\nStates v. Thibodeaux, 211 F.3d 910, 912 (5th Cir. 2000)); United States v. Herrera, 313 F.3d\n882, 885 (5th Cir. 2002) (en banc).\n\n                                             20\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 21   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20514\nsimply requires a defendant to “attempt to cause” or “willfully cause” bodily\ninjury to another. Cannon does not dispute that he threw the first—albeit\nunsuccessful—punch. That punch was an attempt to cause bodily injury to\nJohnson, and the jury could rationally conclude that Cannon committed a federal\nhate crime when he took that first swing. The fact that Johnson continued the\nfight by following Defendants does not render the evidence insufficient. The jury\nwas free to consider these factors and chose to believe that Defendants had\nattempted to willfully cause bodily injury to Johnson.\n      When viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of\nfact could have found the essential element of racial motivation beyond a\nreasonable doubt based on the evidence presented here. Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU.S. 307, 319 (1979). At trial, Staggs testified that Cannon and Kerstetter met\nStaggs and McLaughlin for the first time shortly before the fight. Johnson\ntestified that he had never met any of the four men before. The men did not\nattempt to rob Johnson. There was no evidence of any other communications\nbetween Defendants and Johnson that could have instigated the fight other than\nthe repeated use of the word “ni--er.” Collectively, these facts could have led a\njury to rule out other non-racially motivated reasons for the brawl. When the\nthree Defendants and Staggs first met, Staggs heard either Cannon or\nKerstetter say, “See, I told you them [sic] are woods.” At trial, a gang tattoo\nexpert testified that “wood” is used by members of white-supremacy\norganizations to describe themselves or other white people.         McLaughlin\nresponded to the comment by lifting up his shirt to show the other men his\ntattoos, which included a swastika, sig runes, a bald man preparing to stab a\nhead with the Star of David on it, a picture of a klansman standing in flames\nwith a swastika behind him, the motto of a white-supremacist group called the\nAryan Circle, and the words “white pride.” Cannon also had a number of tattoos\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543          Page: 22     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\nassociated with white-supremacist views, including sig runes, a German military\niron cross, a swastika, the word “wood,” and a woodpecker.\n       Cannon and McLaughlin argue that the evidence presented at trial cannot\nsupport a conviction under § 249(a)(1) because there is no proof of premeditation\nor a plan to attack members of a particular group—in this case, African-\nAmericans.      Rather, they were on a mutual quest for beer.                  Cannon and\nMcLaughlin note that a survey of hate crime cases indicates that the defendants\nwho were found to have a racial animus always have a plan to attack a member\nof a minority group.16 See, e.g., United States v. Allen, 341 F.3d 870, 875 (9th\nCir. 2003) (defendants “patroll[ed]” park with weapons and “moved toward the\ncenter of the park looking for racial minorities and Jews”); Nelson, 277 F.3d at\n170 (“In response to Price’s exhortations, many people in the crowd began to yell,\n‘Get the Jews.’”); United States v. Bledsoe, 728 F.2d 1094, 1095 (8th Cir. 1984)\n(explaining that “appellant and his companions regularly went to Liberty Park\nto ‘harass homosexuals’”). In contrast, Cannon and McLaughlin note that there\nwas no evidence presented at trial to indicate that Defendants and Staggs were\nlooking to attack an African-American, or anyone else, when they set off\ntogether. Instead, Staggs testified that they were looking for beer and never\ndiscussed African-Americans or any other minority groups before their\nencounter with Johnson.\n       We disagree that § 249(a)(1) requires any such showing of premeditation.\nAlthough Defendants point to cases from other circuits involving premeditation,\nnone of those courts required premeditation or a plan of attack to sustain federal\nhate crime charges. See, e.g., Nelson, 277 F.3d 164; Bledsoe, 728 F.2d 1094;\n\n\n       16\n          These cases deal with another hate crime provision, 18 U.S.C. § 245(b)(2)(B), which\nrequires that the defendant’s actions be motivated based on “an animus against the victim on\naccount of her race, religion, etc., that is, her membership in a class or category the statute\nprotects.” United States v. Nelson, 277 F.3d 164, 194 (2d Cir. 2002). Section 245(b)(2)(B) is\nnot at issue here.\n\n                                              22\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543      Page: 23    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\nAllen, 341 F.3d 870. Evidence of such a plan is no doubt helpful to show that a\ndefendant was racially motivated, but it is not necessary so long as there is other\nevidence of the defendant’s motivation. Imposing a plan or premeditation\nrequirement would conflict with the plain language of § 249(a)(1), which does not\ninclude such an element. So long as the jury heard evidence that indicated\nDefendants had the necessary race-based motivation at the time they inflicted\nor attempted to inflict bodily injury on Johnson, we cannot say that there was\ninsufficient evidence for the jury to find them guilty under § 249(a)(1).\n      Cannon and McLaughlin also argue that speech-based evidence showing\nthat Defendants harbored white-supremacist views, such as their tattoos and\nuse of racial epithets, was insufficient to show that the assault was motivated\nby race. Once again, we must disagree. The Supreme Court has made clear that\nthe First Amendment “does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to\nestablish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent.” Wisconsin v.\nMitchell, 508 U.S. 476, 489 (1993). Moreover, our sister circuits who have\nconsidered this issue have all allowed speech-based evidence to support a finding\nthat a crime was motivated by racial hatred. See, e.g., Allen, 341 F.3d at 885–86\n(evidence of racist tattoos and literature, and skinhead paraphernalia such as\ncombat boots and swastika arm-bands were relevant to proving racial animus);\nUnited States v. Magleby, 241 F.3d 1306, 1318–19 (10th Cir. 2001) (evidence that\nthe defendant listened to CD with racist lyrics was relevant to establishing that\nthe defendant targeted the victims because of their race); United States v.\nWoodlee, 136 F.3d 1399, 1410–11 (10th Cir. 1998) (“Evidence of past racial\nanimosity is relevant” to establishing that defendant acted because of race.);\nUnited States v. Dunnaway, 88 F.3d 617, 618–19 (8th Cir. 1996) (evidence of\ndefendant’s “racist views, behavior, and speech” relevant to establishing element\nof the crime requiring “discriminatory purpose and intent”); O’Neal v. Delo, 44\nF.3d 655, 661 (8th Cir. 1995) (defendant’s membership in Aryan Brotherhood\n\n                                        23\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 24   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\nrelevant to question of whether racial animus was motive for murder); United\nStates v. Franklin, 704 F.2d 1183, 1187–88 (10th Cir. 1983) (admitting testimony\nregarding the defendant’s self-identification as a racist and strong dislike of\nAfrican-Americans and Jews and the mixing of black and white races relevant\ngiven that statute requires that the defendant have acted because of race).\n      Cannon and McLaughlin argue that as repugnant as their views and\nbehavior may have been, the evidence is insufficient to show that their actions\nwere racially motivated because not all Defendants used racial epithets, and\ntheir tattoos do not indicate that they were all members of a particular group\nwith white-supremacist views. Cannon notes that Staggs did not have any\ntattoos at all. Cannon and McLaughlin argue that although the symbols in the\ntattoos are all indicative of groups who believe that whites are superior to other\nraces, the gang expert also testified that not all individuals who have these\ntattoos are affiliated with a gang or organization. The expert also testified that\nmembers of these different groups do not necessarily share a common set of\nbeliefs. There was also evidence that Kerstetter tattooed over one of his tattoos,\nand that individuals sometimes seek to cover up tattoos in this way when they\nno longer want them on their bodies.\n      The jury was able to see the markings on the Defendants’ bodies and to\nhear the words that they used in connection with the attack. Johnson testified\nthat the men called him a “ni--er” multiple times immediately before Cannon\nthrew the first punch and that Cannon “flashed a smile” at him just before\ntaking that first swing. Given Defendants’ use of racial epithets in front of\nJohnson immediately before the fight, a rational jury could have inferred that\nthis smile demonstrated Cannon’s desire to fight, and therefore cause bodily\ninjury to Johnson. Following the fight, police officer Samuel Thomas testified\nthat he heard Cannon yell the word “ni--er” several times. Viewed in the light\n\n\n\n                                       24\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543       Page: 25    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\nmost favorable to the verdict there was sufficient evidence from which the jury\ncould infer that Cannon and McLaughlin attacked Johnson “because of” race.17\n                                          IV.\n      For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Defendants’ convictions.\n\n\n\n\n      17\n         Cannon and McLaughlin also argue that there was no evidence presented that\nJohnson was African-American, but the jury was able to see Johnson during his testimony,\nand take his appearance into account when reaching their determination.\n\n                                          25\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543        Page: 26     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20514\nJENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n       Under binding precedent, § 249(a)(1) is constitutionally valid. I write\nseparately to express my concern that there is a growing tension between the\nSupreme Court’s precedent regarding the scope of Congress’s powers under § 2\nof the Thirteenth Amendment1 and the Supreme Court’s subsequent decisions\nregarding the other Reconstruction Amendments and the Commerce Clause.\nOur sister circuit noted similar concerns in United States v. Hatch, 722 F.3d\n1193 (10th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 13-6765, 2014 WL 1124872 (Mar. 24, 2014).\nThis tension between the case law is even more pronounced in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013),\nwhich is not discussed in Hatch. In my view, we would benefit from additional\nguidance from the Supreme Court on how to harmonize these lines of precedent.\n                                             I.\n       As noted in the panel opinion, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments are collectively referred to as the Reconstruction Amendments. All\nthree Amendments were ratified between 1865 and 1870 in the wake of the Civil\nWar. Although each Amendment provides unique powers, they also share “a\nunity of purpose, when taken in connection with the history of the times, which\ncannot fail to have an important bearing on any question of doubt concerning\ntheir true meaning.” Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1202 (citing Slaughter-House Cases, 83\nU.S. 36, 67 (1872)). That “unity of purpose” was to confront slavery, and the\natrocious practices associated with it. See George Rutherglen, State Action,\n\n\n       1\n         Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment provides Congress with the power to legislate\nagainst “badges” and “incidents” of slavery. Section 1 of the Thirteenth Amendment provides\nCongress with a separate power to prohibit involuntary servitude, which is understood as\nlabor coerced by physical force or restraint. See United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931,\n944–48 (1988); Jennifer Mason McAward, Defining the Badges and Incidents of Slavery, 14 U.\nPa. J. Const. L. 561, 567 (2012). Only Congress’s power under § 2 of the Thirteenth\nAmendment is at issue in this case. Neither Defendants nor Amici contest Congress’s ability\nto pass legislation to prevent involuntary servitude.\n\n                                            26\n\f    Case: 12-20514        Document: 00512607543          Page: 27     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\nPrivate Action, and the Thirteenth Amendment, 94 Va. L. Rev. 1367, 1370, 1378\n(2008).\n       The Thirteenth Amendment provides that “neither slavery nor involuntary\nservitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been\nduly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their\njurisdiction.” U.S. Const. amend. XIII. The Fourteenth Amendment places\nlimits on the ability of the states to curtail the rights of citizens. U.S. Const.\namend. XIV. The Fifteenth Amendment states that “[t]he right of citizens of the\nUnited States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by\nany state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” U.S.\nConst. amend. XV, § 1. Using nearly identical language, each Amendment\nprovides Congress with the power to enforce its provisions through appropriate\nlegislation.2\n       Defendants and Amici argue that the nearly identical text in § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment and § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment logically indicates\nthat the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Shelby County regarding the Fifteenth\nAmendment should apply in the Thirteenth Amendment context as well. In\nShelby County, the Supreme Court addressed whether § 5 of the Voting Rights\nAct—which was passed pursuant to Congress’s Fifteenth Amendment\npowers—continued to satisfy constitutional requirements. Shelby Cnty., 133 S.\nCt. at 2619. In overturning § 5’s pre-clearance requirement, the Supreme Court\nnoted that Congress could not rely on “decades-old data and eradicated\npractices” to justify the requirement. Id. at 2627. As the Supreme Court\nexplained,“the [Voting Rights] Act imposes current burdens and must be\n\n\n       2\n         Both the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendment provide that “Congress shall have\npower to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” U.S. Const. amend. XIII, § 2; U.S.\nConst. amend. XV, § 2. The Fourteenth Amendment states that “Congress shall have power\nto enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV,\n§ 5.\n\n                                              27\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543          Page: 28     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\njustified by current needs.” Id. at 2622 (citing Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No.\nOne v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203 (2009)).                   This is especially true in\ncircumstances where the federal statute “authorizes federal intrusion into\nsensitive areas of state and local policymaking.” Id. (citing Lopez v. Monterey\nCnty., 525 U.S. 266, 282 (1999)). Given the almost identical language in the\nThirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, Shelby County’s admonition might be\napplied here as well.\n       In passing § 249(a)(1), Congress focused on past conditions and did not\nmake any findings that current state laws, or the individuals charged with\nenforcing them, were failing to adequately protect victims from racially-\nmotivated crimes.3 Specifically, Congress noted that\n       [s]lavery and involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and\n       after the adoption of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the\n\n\n       3\n         The government pointed out that Congress presented statistics showing that hate\ncrimes continue to take place in modern society. See H.R. Rep. No. 86, pt. 1, 111th Cong., 1st\nSess. 5–6 (2009). While it is unfortunately true that hate crimes continue to occur, Congress\nalso noted that such crimes have been in decline during the past ten years. Id. at 43–44. More\nimportantly, Congress did not make any findings to suggest that the states are not adequately\naddressing this problem. Instead, Congress focused on the then-existing limits on federal hate\ncrimes laws, and mentioned only a few anecdotal instances where state prosecutors did not\nbring charges under state hate crimes laws, or juries did not convict defendants. Id. at 6–9.\n       Furthermore, as Defendants and Amici note, the Report’s Dissenting Views section\nstated that, “[u]nfortunately, in their haste to rush this bill through the Committee, the\nmajority has not done any fact finding whatsoever.” Id. at 42. The Dissenting Views section\ngoes on to state that:\n       There is zero evidence that states are not fully prosecuting violent crimes\n       involving ‘‘hate.’’ Moreover, 45 states and the District of Columbia already have\n       laws punishing hate crimes, and Federal law already punishes violence\n       motivated by race or religion in many contexts. . . . Of the 5 states with no\n       current hate crime legislation (Georgia, Indiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, and\n       Wyoming), Georgia and Indiana have passed legislation pertaining to hate\n       crimes in recent years, and in both states the legislation has been struck down\n       by the courts.\nId. at 44. In Shelby County the Supreme Court cited similar changes in the congressional\nfindings to explain why Congress had not justified § 5’s “extraordinary measures” based on\ncurrent conditions. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2624–28.\n\n                                              28\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 29   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n       United States, through widespread public and private violence\n       directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or\n       perceived race, color, or ancestry.\n\nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Pub. L. No.\n111-84, 123 Stat. 2190 (2009), div. E., § 4702 (codified as amended at 18\nU.S.C. § 249) (emphasis added). Shelby County suggests that this congressional\nfinding regarding circumstances now more than 100 years old cannot serve as\nthe justification for a current expansion of Congress’s powers under the\nThirteenth Amendment. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2619 (“Congress did not\nuse the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current\nconditions. It instead reenacted a formula based on 40–year–old facts having no\nlogical relation to the present day.”).\n       There is no doubt that hate crimes and racial discrimination still exist.\nThere is also no doubt that such crimes are deplorable acts. But the question,\nfollowing Shelby County, is whether § 249(a)(1) satisfies constitutional\nrequirements in our current society. Because the Shepard-Byrd Act “imposes\ncurrent burdens,” perhaps, like the Voting Rights Act, it too “must be justified”\nwith congressional findings regarding “current needs.” Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct.\nat 2619 (citing Nw. Austin, 557 U.S. 193).\n                                          II.\n       As the panel opinion explains, the words “badges” and “incidents” were\noriginally terms of art with specific meanings tied to their historical context.\n“Incidents” referred to public laws that applied in the antebellum slaveholding\nstates. See McAward, supra at 575. “Badges” generally referred to “indicators,\nphysical or otherwise, of African-Americans’ slave or subordinate status.” Id. at\n575.   The Supreme Court’s earlier case law likewise took a more limited view\nof the scope of these terms. See Hodges v. Unites States, 203 U.S. 1, 14–16\n\n\n                                          29\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 30   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20514\n(1906). Then, in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., the Supreme Court reasoned that\n“[s]urely Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally\nto determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery.” 392 U.S. 409,\n440 (1968).\n      Jones’s articulation of congressional power under § 2 of the Thirteenth\nAmendment is thus in tension with the Supreme Court’s discussion of\ncongressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment in City of Boerne v.\nFlores, 521 U.S. 507, 529 (1997). As the Supreme Court cautioned in Flores:\n      If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth\n      Amendment’s meaning, no longer would the Constitution be\n      “superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.” It\n      would be “on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other\n      acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.”\n      Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that\n      would limit congressional power.\n\nId. (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)). Yet under the\nexpansive interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment found in Jones, Congress\nhas just such a power to define “badges” and “incidents” of slavery. Under our\nexisting Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence, it has indeed become difficult to\n“conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power.” Id. As the Tenth\nCircuit recently explained in Hatch, “this interpretation gives Congress the\npower to define the meaning of the Constitution—a rare power indeed.” 722\nF.3d at 1204.\n      Moreover, the plain language of § 249(a)(1) has the power to implicate vast\nswaths of activities that do not relate to removing the “badges” and “incidents”\nof slavery as the terms were originally understood. It reaches even racial\nviolence against white persons when those acts are based on race. Cf. Jones, 392\n\n\n                                       30\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543         Page: 31    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-20514\nU.S. at 443; McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 288 n.18\n(1976); Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1208.\n\n       The Supreme Court has cautioned against such expansions of federal law\ninto areas, like police power, that are the historical prerogative of the states. See\nShelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2623; United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 661 n.8\n(2000). As the panel opinion details, the incident began with a racial epithet and\na missed-punch. The views and actions of the three Defendants are unarguably\nreprehensible, and punishable under Texas law.4 But whether their distasteful\nactions may be constitutionally punished under federal law is by no means a\nfrivolous question.5 See Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1201.\n       As Cannon points out, “[a]s repugnant as ‘hate crimes’ may be, the\nConstitution does not vest authority in the federal government to prosecute such\ncrimes without a federal nexus. We entrust the prosecution of some of the most\nheinous crimes, including murders, rapes, arson, and assaults, to our state\ncriminal justice systems. Indeed, at least forty five (45) states have criminal\nstatutes that impose harsher penalties for crimes that are motivated by bias\nincluding Texas.” (citing Anti-Defamation League, State Hate Crime Provisions\n(April 28, 2009)).\n                                           III.\n       In Shelby County, the Supreme Court recognized that federal regulations\nthat implicate areas of traditional state power may have profound impacts on\nthe balance of federalism:\n\n\n\n       4\n       The record here shows that Defendants were charged in Harris County, Texas, with\nmisdemeanor assault under state law, and those charges were dropped only after the\ngovernment brought federal hate crime charges against Defendants.\n       5\n        This in no way diminishes the insult and assault that Johnson was made to suffer at\nthe hands of Defendants. As counsel for Cannon readily admits, “[D]efendants are obnoxious\npeople who hold and openly display offensive opinions about racial inequality.”\n\n                                            31\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 32    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-20514\n      [T]he Constitution provides that all powers not specifically granted\n      to the Federal Government are reserved to the States or citizens.\n      This allocation of powers in our federal system preserves the\n      integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States. But the\n      federal balance is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism\n      secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of\n      sovereign power.\n\nShelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2623 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). Just as “the Framers of the Constitution intended the States to keep\nfor themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate\nelections” so too did they intend for the general police powers to lie with the\nStates. See id; see also United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 n.3 (1995)\n(‘‘When Congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the\nStates, it effects a ‘change in the sensitive relation between federal and state\ncriminal jurisdiction.’’’ (quoting United States v. Emmons, 410 U.S. 396, 411–12\n(1973))); Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U.S. 724, 756 (1985)\n(“Throughout our history the several States have exercised their police powers\nto protect the health and safety of their citizens. Because these are primarily,\nand historically, . . . matter[s] of local concern, the States traditionally have had\ngreat latitude under their police powers to legislate as to the protection of the\nlives, limbs, health, comfort, and quiet of all persons.” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)); Morrison, 529 U.S. at 661 n.8 (“The regulation and\npunishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities,\nchannels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province\nof the States. Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power,\nwhich the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States,\nthan the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims. . . . [T]he\n\n\n                                         32\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 33    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-20514\nprinciple that [t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited\npowers, while reserving a generalized police power to the States, is deeply\ningrained in our constitutional history.” (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)).\n      The Supreme Court has articulated limits to Congress’s power under the\nCommerce Clause out of concern for balance within our federal system. Thus,\nin both Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, and Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that Congress does not have the authority under the Commerce\nClause to regulate isolated, local activities without a federal nexus. See Lopez,\n514 U.S. at 551 (striking down the Gun–Free School Zones Act as an\nimpermissible attempt to exercise “general federal police power”); Morrison, 529\nU.S. at 605 (striking down the Violence Against Women Act which provided a\nfederal civil remedy to victims of “violence motivated by gender”); see also Hatch,\n722 F.3d at 1203–04.        As the Lopez Court explained, “[t]o uphold the\nGovernment’s contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference\nin a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the\nCommerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.”\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 567. Although the Supreme Court acknowledged that it had\nheld that Congress’s Commerce Clause powers were broad, it declined to extend\nthem further, because “[t]o do so would require us to conclude that the\nConstitution’s enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not\nenumerated, and that there never will be a distinction between what is truly\nnational and what is truly local.” Id. at 567–68 (citations omitted).\n      The breadth of Congress’s power is even more pronounced in this case\nbecause Congress did not pass § 249(a)(1) under the Commerce Clause, as it did\nwith § 249(a)(2). In contrast to § 249(a)(2), § 249(a)(1) does not contain a specific\nrequirement that the conduct involve interstate or foreign travel, use a channel,\nfacility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce, or invoke the\n\n                                         33\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543       Page: 34   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\nspecial maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Compare 18\nU.S.C. § 249(a)(2)(B)(i)(I)-(III) with § 249(a)(1). Unlike the Commerce Clause,\nthe Congress’s power under the Thirteenth Amendment is not limited to\ninterstate activities. Unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not limited to\nstate action. Unlike the Fifteenth Amendment, it does not require Congress to\nact based on a need grounded in current conditions. Congress’s power under the\nThirteenth Amendment is constrained only by the definition of “badges” or\n“incidents” of slavery. See Jones, 392 U.S. at 440; see generally Rutherglen,\nsupra at 1367. And under Jones, that definition only a self-imposed limit.\nCongress’s powers are constrained only by Congress.\n                                        IV.\n\n      In conclusion, I do not write this special concurrence to suggest that\nracially motivated crimes of hate are anything other than despicable acts. I\nwrite instead to point out the tensions between several lines of the Supreme\nCourt’s constitutional jurisprudence. There is tension between the divergent\napplication of nearly identical language in the Reconstruction Amendments.\nThere is tension between Shelby County’s emphasis on current conditions, and\nthe congressional findings supporting the Shepard-Byrd Act, which are grounded\nin the past. There is tension between the limits that Flores places on Congress’s\nability to define the scope of its powers, and its ability to interpret “badges” and\n“incidents” under Jones. There is tension between the limits placed on the\nability of the federal government to intrude into the states’ police powers under\nMorrison and Lopez, and its power to do so here.\n      In this case, the federal law reaches acts between private actors, within\nthe heart of the states’ traditional police powers, without any findings that\nstates currently and consistently fail to adequately address the problem. The\nfederal law does not profess to rely on Congress’s Commerce Clause authority;\n\n\n                                        34\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 35   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20514\ninstead, § 249(a)(1) relies on a constitutional provision where Congress has been\ngiven the power to set its own parameters.        While such a law is clearly\npermissible under existing Thirteenth Amendment precedent, there is\nsubstantial tension with other lines of recent constitutional jurisprudence. See\nHatch, 722 F.3d at 1201 (“While Hatch’s arguments raise important federalism\nquestions, in light of Jones it will be up to the Supreme Court to choose whether\nto extend its more recent federalism cases to the Thirteenth Amendment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f",

Over the next few days, both men were hired\nfor various odd jobs, including by an African-American contractor.          They\nfrequented several local missions with African-American patrons. On August\n13, 2011, the day of the assault, the two men ate a free dinner together at a\nservice known as Church Under the Bridge. Staggs and McLaughlin were the\nonly two white men to attend the service; the other participants were all African-\nAmerican. When asked at trial whether McLaughlin ever had trouble with any\nof the individuals at these services, Staggs answered, “Quite the contrary,\nactually.” After dinner Staggs and McLaughlin bought some wine, finished the\nbottle, and went in search of more alcohol. The two men were walking together\non the streets of downtown Houston just before midnight when they met Cannon\nand Kerstetter for the first time. Cannon and Kerstetter ran towards Staggs\nand McLaughlin. Staggs heard either Cannon or Kerstetter say, “See, I told you\nthem [sic] are woods.”\n      McLaughlin responded to the comment by lifting up his shirt to show the\nother men his tattoos, which included a swastika, sig runes, a bald man\npreparing to stab a head with the Star of David on it, a picture of a klansman\nstanding in flames with a swastika behind him, the motto of a group called the\nAryan Circle, and the words “white pride.” Staggs noticed Cannon had tattoos\non his face. He also noticed “little lightning bolts” tattooed on the back of\n\n                                        2\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543       Page: 3   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\nKerstetter’s fingers.\n      A gang tattoo expert would later testify that “wood” is a term commonly\nused by members of white-supremacy organizations to describe themselves or\nother white people. The term is not affiliated with a particular group or\norganization but more generally signals “pride in the [w]hite race.” The expert\nalso testified that the lightning bolts tattoos on Cannon’s body are known as “sig\nrunes” or “SS bolts” and refer to the insignia adopted by the Schutzstaffel, or\nSS—a political and racial organization in Nazi Germany.                Cannon and\nKerstetter introduced themselves, and the four men shook hands and exchanged\nnames.    The three Defendants and Staggs then set off together to find more\nalcohol. At no point did the men discuss racial minorities, or make any plans to\nattack anyone.\n      Johnson, an African-American, was sitting alone at a bus stop, waiting to\ngo home after spending the day with his daughter to celebrate her birthday.\nJohnson was an amateur heavyweight boxer and former Golden Glove\nparticipant. He stood six feet, four inches tall and weighed over 200 pounds.\nJohnson had just finished talking to his daughter on the phone when he heard\nand saw the three Defendants and Staggs “coming around the corner with their\nshirts off, bald heads, loud and rowdy.” Johnson later testified that he had not\nmet any of the four men before that night.\n      According to Johnson, Cannon asked him, “Yo, bro, do you have the time?”\nAt that point Johnson looked up and noticed that Cannon was covered in tattoos.\nJohnson recognized some of the small lightning bolt tattoos on Cannon as white-\nsupremacist “Nazi” symbols. Johnson testified that he responded, “No.” One\nof the other men then said to Cannon. “Why did you call that ni--er a ‘bro’? You\nain’t supposed to call no ni--er a ‘bro.’”\n      “What did he say?” Johnson responded, to which Cannon answered, “You\nheard him, ‘ni--er.’ He called you a ‘ni--er,’ ‘ni--er.’”\n\n                                             3\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543      Page: 4    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\n       Johnson testified that the four men surrounded him. He stood up with his\nback against the pole and put up his guard. Cannon flashed a smile and swung\na punch at Johnson. Johnson weaved, dodged the blow, and swung back, hitting\nCannon. According to Johnson, all four men jumped in and started punching\nJohnson. Someone grabbed Johnson by the ankles, and Johnson fell to the\nground. One of the men lay on top of Johnson while the others stomped on his\nhead. At some point, the men stopped battering Johnson and walked away.\n       Staggs, who testified as a government witness, told a slightly different\nversion of the encounter.1 According to Staggs, he watched from twenty to thirty\nfeet away while McLaughlin and Cannon spoke to Johnson. He could not hear\ntheir conversation, and did not hear any of the men use racial slurs. Staggs\ntestified that a few seconds later, Johnson appeared mad, jumped up, and\nstarted boxing with Cannon. Johnson was getting the better of Cannon, so\nMcLaughlin grabbed Johnson around the waist to try to pull him off of Cannon.\nA few moments later Kerstetter, who had been standing with Staggs, ran over\nand joined the fight. Staggs did not think the fight was very serious and saw no\nreason to get involved. He testified that “there was only one mad person; and\nthe other guys appeared to be trying to get away.” Staggs did not see anyone\nstomp on Johnson. Instead, he testified that as soon as they succeeded in getting\nJohnson down on the ground, the three Defendants immediately ran away from\nhim.\n           Soon after, Johnson pulled himself up. He ran after the four men, and\neventually caught up with Staggs. Johnson punched Staggs, and Staggs fell.\nJohnson turned around, and threw another punch to knock a second member of\nthe group to the ground. The other two men charged at Johnson, and knocked\nJohnson down for the second time. The two men whom Johnson had punched\n\n       1\n        The government agreed to dismiss the charges against Staggs in exchange for his\ntestimony at trial.\n\n                                          4\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 5   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nto the ground got up and joined the other members of the group. At that point,\nLorie Garcia—a witness who passed the scene while she was driving in the car\nwith her husband—testified that she saw four white men surrounding a black\nman, and that two of them were punching him. She immediately called 911.\n      Meanwhile, Staggs and the three Defendants had walked away for a\nsecond time and left Johnson on the ground. Johnson again pulled himself up\nand picked up a sandbag. He tried to throw it at the four men, but found that\nit was too heavy. He dropped it and did not pursue the men. Several police cars\nquickly arrived at the scene. The first few police cars drove past Johnson. As\nthey did so, Johnson pointed to the direction in which the four men had run off.\nAnother police car then stopped by Johnson to control the scene. Johnson’s face\nwas swelling and bleeding heavily. His body was bruised, and he staggered as\nhe walked. The police eventually detained Staggs and the three Defendants. The\njury heard live and video deposition testimony from officers that Cannon and\nMcLaughlin were agitated upon being detained and used racial slurs when they\nwere arrested—including the word “ni--er” to refer to responding officers who\nwere African-American.\n      Defendants were initially charged in Harris County, Texas, with\nmisdemeanor assault. These state law misdemeanor charges were dropped after\nthe prosecution brought federal hate crime charges against Defendants. A\nfederal grand jury in the Southern District of Texas returned a one-count\nindictment charging Defendants with a violation of § 249(a)(1) of the Shepard-\nByrd Act. Specifically, the federal indictment alleged that “while aiding and\nabetting each other,” Defendants “willfully caused bodily injury to [Johnson],\nwho is African-American, because of his actual or perceived race, color, and\nnational origin.” McLaughlin and Cannon filed pre-trial motions to dismiss the\nindictment, arguing that § 249(a)(1) is an invalid exercise of congressional power\nunder the Thirteenth Amendment.          The government filed a response in\n\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543     Page: 6   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 12-20514\n\nopposition, and the district court denied Defendants’ motions.\n         Defendants moved for judgments of acquittal at the end of the\ngovernment’s evidence, and again at the close of all evidence. The district court\ndenied both motions. The jury returned a guilty verdict against all three\nDefendants. Defendants then filed motions for a judgment of acquittal or a new\ntrial, again arguing that § 249(a)(1) was invalid under the Thirteenth\nAmendment and that the prosecution had not met its burden in proving that\nthey caused bodily injury to Johnson because of his actual or perceived race. The\ndistrict court denied the motions and entered a final judgment.

Id. Specifically, the Supreme Court\nreasoned that discrimination in public accommodations had “nothing to do with\nslavery or involuntary servitude,” and therefore fell outside the scope of the\nThirteenth Amendment. Id. at 24.\n      Although the Supreme Court found the connection between the denial of\npublic accommodation and slavery too attenuated for purposes of the Thirteenth\nAmendment, it also stated in dicta that the scope of the Thirteenth Amendment\nextended beyond abolishing laws or private acts that perpetuated slavery or\ninvoluntary servitude in a literal sense. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\n      It is true that slavery cannot exist without law any more than\n      property in lands and goods can exist without law, and therefore the\n      Thirteenth Amendment may be regarded as nullifying all State laws\n      which establish or uphold slavery. But it has a reflex character\n      also, establishing and decreeing universal civil and political freedom\n      throughout the United States; and it is assumed that the power\n      vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,\n      clothes Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper\n      for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United\n      States.\nId. at 16 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court did not clearly delineate the\nscope of “badges” and “incidents” of slavery. Scholars have observed that the\nSupreme Court interpreted this phrase far more narrowly in the past than it\ndoes today. See, e.g., Jack M. Balkin & Sanford Levinson, The Dangerous\nThirteenth Amendment, 112 Colum. L. Rev. 1459, 1469 (2012) (noting that the\nterm “‘badges or incidents of slavery,’ a term taken from the 1883 Civil Rights\nCases . . . had construed Congress’s [enforcement] powers [under the Thirteenth\nAmendment] far more narrowly”).\n      Twenty-three years later in Hodges v. Unites States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1447641\"><a href=\"/opinion/1447641/hodges-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1906), the\nSupreme Court held that the Thirteenth Amendment did not provide Congress\nwith the power to outlaw private parties’ interference with the right to make or\nenforce a contract based on race. The Supreme Court overturned the convictions\n\n                                        8\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 9   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nof several white men for threatening and harassing African-American workers\nat a sawmill. In doing so, the Supreme Court explained that “it was not the\nintent of the [Thirteenth] Amendment to denounce every act done to an\nindividual which was wrong if done to a free man, and yet justified in a condition\nof slavery, and to give authority to Congress to enforce such denunciation.” Id.\nat 19. Instead, the Supreme Court explained that the meaning of the Thirteen\nAmendment’s grant of authority is “as clear as language can make it. The things\ndenounced are slavery and involuntary servitude, and Congress is given power\nto enforce that denunciation. All understand by these terms a condition of\nenforced compulsory service of one to another.” Id. at 16. The Supreme Court\nrefused to extend its interpretation of congressional power beyond that point,\nexplaining that\n      prior to the three post bellum amendments to the Constitution the\n      national government had no jurisdiction over a wrong like that\n      charged in this indictment is conceded; that the 14th and 15th\n      Amendments do not justify the legislation is also beyond dispute, for\n      they, as repeatedly held, are restrictions upon state action, and no\n      action on the part of the state is complained of. Unless, therefore,\n      the 13th Amendment vests in the nation the jurisdiction claimed,\n      the remedy must be sought through state action and in state\n      tribunals . . . . Notwithstanding the adoption of these three\n      amendments, the national government still remains one of\n      enumerated powers . . . . True, the 13th Amendment grants certain\n      specified and additional power to Congress, but any congressional\n      legislation directed against individual action which was not\n      warranted before the 13th Amendment must find authority in it.\nId. at 14–16.\n      This interpretation changed in 1968. In Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., the\nSupreme Court adopted a broader view of the terms “badges” and “incidents” of\nslavery under the Thirteenth Amendment. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107748\"><a href=\"/opinion/107748/jones-v-alfred-h-mayer-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968). All parties\nagree that Jones is the logical starting point for our constitutional analysis in\nthis case. In Jones, the owners of a suburban St. Louis subdivision refused to\n\n\n                                        9\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 10   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nsell a home to a potential buyer solely because he was African-American. Id. at\n412. Jones filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1982, which provides, “All citizens of the\nUnited States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and\nconvey real and personal property.” 42 U.S.C. § 1982. The seller argued that\n§ 1982 was unconstitutional to the extent that it applied to purely private\nconduct, rather than to state action. 392 U.S. at 429–36. The Supreme Court\ndisagreed, concluding that Congress had the authority under § 2 of the\nThirteenth Amendment to enact the law. Id. at 413. Specifically, the Supreme\nCourt held that the scope of Congress’s Thirteenth Amendment enforcement\npower was not limited to measures intended to end structures of slavery in a\nliteral or a formal sense. Instead, the Supreme Court held that Congress has the\nauthority to enact legislation necessary to abolish the “badges” and “incidents”\nof slavery, as well as the power to rationally determine what those “badges” and\n“incidents” are. Id. at 440–44. The Supreme Court explained that courts should\nonly invalidate legislation enacted under the Thirteenth Amendment if they\nconclude that Congress made an irrational determination in deciding what\nconstitutes “badges” and “incidents” of slavery in passing legislation to address\nthem. See id. at 439–43.\n      We applied the Supreme Court’s approach in United States v. Bob\nLawrence Realty, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"308694\"><a href=\"/opinion/308694/united-states-v-bob-lawrence-realty-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1973). In Bob Lawrence Realty, our\ncourt concluded that § 3604(e) of the Fair Housing Act fell “within the\nconstitutional authority of Congress to enact legislation to enforce the\nThirteenth Amendment.” Id. at 117. As we explained,\n      We think that the mandate of Jones is clear. This Court will give\n      great deference, as indeed it must, to the congressional\n      determination that § 3604(e) will effectuate the purpose of the\n      Thirteenth Amendment by aiding in the elimination of the “badges\n      and incidents of slavery in the United States.” Jones v. Mayer Co.,\n\n\n                                       10\n\f   Case: 12-20514         Document: 00512607543          Page: 11      Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\n      supra, 392 U.S. at 439 . . . . Appellants have failed to present any\n      argument that impugns the reasonableness of the congressional\n      determination. Indeed, no such argument can be made in light of\n      the role that blockbusting plays in creating and in perpetuating\n      segregated housing patterns and thus in preventing “. . . a dollar in\n      the hands of a Negro . . . [from purchasing] the same thing as a\n      dollar in the hands of a white man.” Jones v. Mayer Co., supra, 392\n      U.S. at 443; see also, Note, Discriminatory Housing Markets, Racial\n      Unconscionability, and Section 1988: The ‘Contract Buyers League’\n      Case, 80 Yale L. J. 516 (1971). We find that the Thirteenth\n      Amendment empowers Congress to enact § 3604(e).\nId. at 120–21.\n      In enacting the Shepard-Byrd Act, Congress set forth ten findings to\nprovide a basis for the Act in its entirety, including an explicit finding that\n“eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means of eliminating,\nto the extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and\ninvoluntary servitude.” Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes\nPrevention Act, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123 Stat. 2190 (2009), div. E., § 4702\n(codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. § 249) (emphasis added).5 Congress also\n\n      5\n          The other relevant Congressional Findings include the following:\n      (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or perceived race, color\n      . . . of the victim poses a serious national problem.\n      ...\n      (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and involuntary servitude were\n      defined by the race, color, and ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and\n      involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption of the\n      13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States, through widespread\n      public and private violence directed at persons because of their race, color, or\n      ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, eliminating racially\n      motivated violence is an important means of eliminating, to the extent possible,\n      the badges, incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n      (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the\n      Constitution of the United States were adopted, and continuing to date,\n      members of certain religious and national origin groups were and are perceived\n      to be distinct “races”. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the extent possible, the\n      badges, incidents, and relics of slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on\n      the basis of real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to the extent\n\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543         Page: 12     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 12-20514\n\ncompiled statistics regarding the prevalence of hate crimes in American society\nand the need for expanded federal jurisdiction over the problem. See H.R. Rep.\nNo. 111-86, Pt. 1, at 5–6 (2009). Both the Supreme Court and our own precedent\nafford Congress ample deference in defining what private actions qualify as\n“badges” and “incidents” of slavery. See Jones, 392 U.S. at 440; Bob Lawrence\nRealty, Inc., 474 F.2d at 120. Under our Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence,\nwe must respect Congress’s determination unless it lacks a rational basis.\n       In order to determine whether racially motivated violence is rationally\nconsidered one of the “badges” or “incidents” of slavery, we must first examine\nwhat those terms mean. The words “badges” and “incidents” were originally\nterms of art with specific meanings tied to their historical context.\n       An incident of slavery, as that term was used, was any legal right\n       or restriction that necessarily accompanied the institution of\n       slavery. Most often, “incident” was used to refer to the aspects of\n       property law that applied to the ownership and transfer of slaves.\n       It also was used to refer to the civil disabilities imposed on slaves by\n       virtue of their status as property. In all, the term has clear, finite,\n       historically determined meaning. It refers to a closed set of public\n       laws that applied in the antebellum slaveholding states. Identifying\n       an “incident of slavery,” then, is an exercise in historical inquiry.\nJennifer Mason McAward, Defining the Badges and Incidents of Slavery, 14 U.\nPa. J. Const. L. 561, 575 (2012).\n       While the definition of badge has broadened over time, “in its most general\nsense, the term ‘badge of slavery’ . . . refers to indicators, physical or otherwise,\nof African-Americans’ slave or subordinate status.” Id. at 575. Before the Civil\nWar, the term referred to skin color. After the War, it came to mean the kinds\n\n\n\n       such religions or national origins were regarded as races at the time of the\n       adoption of the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the\n       United States.\nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Pub. L. No. 111-84, 123\nStat. 2190 (2009), div. E., § 4702 (codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. § 249) (emphasis added).\n\n                                             12\n\f    Case: 12-20514        Document: 00512607543          Page: 13     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\n\nof legal restrictions, such as the Black Codes, that were imposed on African-\nAmericans to try to enforce inferior status on them. After the end of Black\nCodes, it came to mean “less formal but equally virulent means—including\nwidespread violence and discrimination, disparate enforcement of racially\nneutral laws, and eventually, Jim Crow laws—to keep the freed slaves in an\ninferior status.” Id. at 581–82.6\n       As the Tenth Circuit explained in its opinion holding that § 249(a)(1) is a\nvalid exercise of Congress’s power under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment:\n       Congress could rationally conclude that physically attacking a\n       person of a particular race because of animus toward or a desire to\n       assert superiority over that race is a badge or incident of slavery.\n       The antebellum North Carolina Supreme Court, for example,\n       characterized unrestrained master-on-slave violence as one of\n       slavery’s most necessary features.

Indeed, the terms “badge”\n       and “incident” are terms of art that refer to specific aspects of the slave system\n       and its legacy.

The Eighth Circuit then explained that “Maybee provides no reason why\na finding of constitutional sufficiency of a statute based on two elements establishes a\nprecedent that both elements are necessary to avoid constitutional infirmity.” Id. Given this\nnarrow challenge, the Eight Circuit’s decision in Maybee does not provide as thorough of an\nanalysis of the possible constitutional issues with § 249(a)(1) as the Tenth Circuit does.\n       8\n         Todd Gaziano, Gail Heriot, and Peter Kirsanow (“Amici”) are three members of the\neight-member U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, a federal commission charged with the\nresponsibility of advising the President, Congress, and the American people on issues of civil\nrights. Amici filed briefing solely in their capacities as private citizens and not as Commission\nrepresentatives.\n       9\n         The petitioner and Amici raised many of these same arguments in their petitions for\ncertiorai in Hatch.\n\n                                               15\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543      Page: 16    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n\nSupreme Court explained in Flores:\n      Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what\n      the right is. It has been given the power “to enforce,” not the power\n      to determine what constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not\n      so, what Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any\n      meaningful sense, the “provisions of [the Fourteenth Amendment].”\n521 U.S. at 519. The Supreme Court further warned that\n      If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth\n      Amendment’s meaning, no longer would the Constitution be\n      “superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.” It\n      would be “on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other\n      acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.”\n      Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that\n      would limit congressional power.\nId. at 529 (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).\n      Defendants and Amici argue that under the interpretation of the\nThirteenth Amendment found in Jones, Congress has just such a power to alter\nthe Thirteenth Amendment’s meaning because it can define “badges” and\n“incidents” of slavery. Defendants argue that under the Supreme Court’s\nexisting Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence, it has become difficult to\n“conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power.” Id. As the Tenth\nCircuit explained in Hatch:\n      Badges and incidents of slavery, taken at face value, puts emphasis\n      solely on the conduct Congress seeks to prohibit, and it seems to\n      place few limits on what that conduct might be. Given slaves’\n      intensely deplorable treatment and slavery’s lasting effects, nearly\n      every hurtful thing one human could do to another and nearly every\n      disadvantaged state of being might be analogized to slavery—and\n      thereby labeled a badge or incident of slavery under Jones’s rational\n      determination test. In effect, this interpretation gives Congress the\n      power to define the meaning of the Constitution—a rare power\n      indeed.\n722 F.3d at 1204. Amici further argue that this judicial deference to Congress’s\ninterpretation of the scope of its power is at odds with the principle set forth in\n\n\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 12-20514      Document: 00512607543         Page: 17    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                     No. 12-20514\nMcCulloch v.

See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2625–31. The Supreme\nCourt then concluded:\n      Congress may draft another formula based on current conditions.\n      Such a formula is an initial prerequisite to a determination that\n      exceptional conditions still exist justifying such an extraordinary\n      departure from the traditional course of relations between the\n      States and the Federal Government. Our country has changed, and\n      while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress\n      must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem\n      speaks to current conditions.\nId. at 2631 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n      Even if the legal landscape regarding the Reconstruction Amendments has\nchanged in light of Shelby County and Flores, absent a clear directive from the\nSupreme Court, we are bound by prior precedents.

For this same reason, Defendants and Amici’s arguments based\non McCulloch is also foreclosed. As the Tenth Circuit explained in Hatch, “even\nif we assume Hatch’s authorities impliedly undermine Jones’s approach to the\nThirteenth Amendment, we may not blaze a new constitutional trail simply on\nthat basis.” Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1204. Shelby County never mentioned the\nThirteenth Amendment or Jones—rather, the analysis focused on the Fifteenth\nAmendment and the Voting Rights Act. Flores likewise never mentioned the\nThirteenth Amendment or Jones, and did not hold that the “congruence and\nproportionality” standard was applicable beyond the Fourteenth Amendment.13\n\n\n      13\n        Amici argue that even under Jones, § 249(a)(1) is still unconstitutional because\nCongress never purported to address slavery when enacting it. Accordingly to Amici, under\n\n                                           18\n\f    Case: 12-20514          Document: 00512607543          Page: 19     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                          No. 12-20514\nWe therefore continue to follow the Supreme Court’s binding precedent in Jones.\nAs explained above, § 249(a)(1) is a valid exercise of congressional power because\nCongress could rationally determine that racially motivated violence is a badge\nor incident of slavery.\n                                               III.\n       Because we conclude that § 249(a)(1) is constitutional, we now turn to the\nquestion of whether the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to support\nDefendants’ convictions. We conclude that it was. Section 249(a)(1) lists the\nessential elements of a hate crime motivated by race or color under the Shepard-\nByrd Act. In the context of this case, § 249(a)(1) required Defendants to: (1)\nwillfully cause or attempt to cause; (2) bodily injury to any person; (3) because\nof their actual or perceived race or color.14\n       Cannon and McLaughlin only challenge the sufficiency-of-the-evidence as\nto the final element, arguing that there was insufficient proof that they were\nmotivated by Johnson’s race or color when inflicting his injuries. Because\nCannon and McLaughlin properly preserved their challenges to the sufficiency-\n\n\n\n\nJones, legislation passed under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment may be “somewhat\nprophylactic in nature,” but its end goal must still be to prevent slavery. In essence, Amici\nargue that Congress may outlaw badges and incidents of slavery only insofar as those badges\nand incidents are being used to support the institution or reestablishment of slavery, and not\nfor any other purpose. Amici argue that § 249(a)(1) thus fails under the standard set forth in\nFlores, because its ban is not congruent and proportional to the actual problem of slavery. 521\nU.S. at 520.\n        We do not read Jones as narrowly as Amici suggest. In Jones, the Supreme Court\nexplained that, pursuant to its powers under the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress can\nlegislate to address not only practices that support the institution of slavery, but also “vestiges\nof slavery” and “the relic[s] of slavery.” 392 U.S. at 441 n.78, 443. Under Jones, Congress\ncould rationally determine that racially motivated violence is a “badge” or “incident” of slavery.\nSection 249(a)(1) is thus a valid exercise of congressional power. In reaching this conclusion,\nwe are in keeping with our two sister circuits who have addressed the constitutional validity\nof § 249(a)(1).

At trial, Staggs testified that Cannon and Kerstetter met\nStaggs and McLaughlin for the first time shortly before the fight. Johnson\ntestified that he had never met any of the four men before.

There was no evidence of any other communications\nbetween Defendants and Johnson that could have instigated the fight other than\nthe repeated use of the word “ni--er.” Collectively, these facts could have led a\njury to rule out other non-racially motivated reasons for the brawl. When the\nthree Defendants and Staggs first met, Staggs heard either Cannon or\nKerstetter say, “See, I told you them [sic] are woods.” At trial, a gang tattoo\nexpert testified that “wood” is used by members of white-supremacy\norganizations to describe themselves or other white people.         McLaughlin\nresponded to the comment by lifting up his shirt to show the other men his\ntattoos, which included a swastika, sig runes, a bald man preparing to stab a\nhead with the Star of David on it, a picture of a klansman standing in flames\nwith a swastika behind him, the motto of a white-supremacist group called the\nAryan Circle, and the words “white pride.” Cannon also had a number of tattoos\n\n\n\n                                       21\n\f    Case: 12-20514       Document: 00512607543          Page: 22     Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 12-20514\nassociated with white-supremacist views, including sig runes, a German military\niron cross, a swastika, the word “wood,” and a woodpecker.\n       Cannon and McLaughlin argue that the evidence presented at trial cannot\nsupport a conviction under § 249(a)(1) because there is no proof of premeditation\nor a plan to attack members of a particular group—in this case, African-\nAmericans.      Rather, they were on a mutual quest for beer.

Evidence of such a plan is no doubt helpful to show that a\ndefendant was racially motivated, but it is not necessary so long as there is other\nevidence of the defendant’s motivation.

Although each Amendment provides unique powers, they also share “a\nunity of purpose, when taken in connection with the history of the times, which\ncannot fail to have an important bearing on any question of doubt concerning\ntheir true meaning.” Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1202 (citing Slaughter-House Cases, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1872)).

In\nShelby County, the Supreme Court addressed whether § 5 of the Voting Rights\nAct—which was passed pursuant to Congress’s Fifteenth Amendment\npowers—continued to satisfy constitutional requirements. Shelby Cnty., 133 S.\nCt. at 2619. In overturning § 5’s pre-clearance requirement, the Supreme Court\nnoted that Congress could not rely on “decades-old data and eradicated\npractices” to justify the requirement. Id. at 2627.

Given the almost identical language in the\nThirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, Shelby County’s admonition might be\napplied here as well.\n       In passing § 249(a)(1), Congress focused on past conditions and did not\nmake any findings that current state laws, or the individuals charged with\nenforcing them, were failing to adequately protect victims from racially-\nmotivated crimes.3 Specifically, Congress noted that\n       [s]lavery and involuntary servitude were enforced, both prior to and\n       after the adoption of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the\n\n\n       3\n         The government pointed out that Congress presented statistics showing that hate\ncrimes continue to take place in modern society. See H.R. Rep. No. 86, pt. 1, 111th Cong., 1st\nSess. 5–6 (2009). While it is unfortunately true that hate crimes continue to occur, Congress\nalso noted that such crimes have been in decline during the past ten years. Id. at 43–44. More\nimportantly, Congress did not make any findings to suggest that the states are not adequately\naddressing this problem. Instead, Congress focused on the then-existing limits on federal hate\ncrimes laws, and mentioned only a few anecdotal instances where state prosecutors did not\nbring charges under state hate crimes laws, or juries did not convict defendants. Id. at 6–9.\n       Furthermore, as Defendants and Amici note, the Report’s Dissenting Views section\nstated that, “[u]nfortunately, in their haste to rush this bill through the Committee, the\nmajority has not done any fact finding whatsoever.” Id. at 42. The Dissenting Views section\ngoes on to state that:\n       There is zero evidence that states are not fully prosecuting violent crimes\n       involving ‘‘hate.’’ Moreover, 45 states and the District of Columbia already have\n       laws punishing hate crimes, and Federal law already punishes violence\n       motivated by race or religion in many contexts. . . . Of the 5 states with no\n       current hate crime legislation (Georgia, Indiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, and\n       Wyoming), Georgia and Indiana have passed legislation pertaining to hate\n       crimes in recent years, and in both states the legislation has been struck down\n       by the courts.\nId. at 44. In Shelby County the Supreme Court cited similar changes in the congressional\nfindings to explain why Congress had not justified § 5’s “extraordinary measures” based on\ncurrent conditions. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2624–28.\n\n                                              28\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 29   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\n       United States, through widespread public and private violence\n       directed at persons because of their race, color, or ancestry, or\n       perceived race, color, or ancestry.\n\nMatthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, Pub.

Shelby County suggests that this congressional\nfinding regarding circumstances now more than 100 years old cannot serve as\nthe justification for a current expansion of Congress’s powers under the\nThirteenth Amendment. See Shelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2619 (“Congress did not\nuse the record it compiled to shape a coverage formula grounded in current\nconditions. It instead reenacted a formula based on 40–year–old facts having no\nlogical relation to the present day.”).\n       There is no doubt that hate crimes and racial discrimination still exist.\nThere is also no doubt that such crimes are deplorable acts. But the question,\nfollowing Shelby County, is whether § 249(a)(1) satisfies constitutional\nrequirements in our current society. Because the Shepard-Byrd Act “imposes\ncurrent burdens,” perhaps, like the Voting Rights Act, it too “must be justified”\nwith congressional findings regarding “current needs.” Shelby Cnty., 133 S.

As the Supreme Court cautioned in Flores:\n      If Congress could define its own powers by altering the Fourteenth\n      Amendment’s meaning, no longer would the Constitution be\n      “superior paramount law, unchangeable by ordinary means.” It\n      would be “on a level with ordinary legislative acts, and, like other\n      acts, . . . alterable when the legislature shall please to alter it.”\n      Under this approach, it is difficult to conceive of a principle that\n      would limit congressional power.\n\nId. (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)). Yet under the\nexpansive interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment found in Jones, Congress\nhas just such a power to define “badges” and “incidents” of slavery. Under our\nexisting Thirteenth Amendment jurisprudence, it has indeed become difficult to\n“conceive of a principle that would limit congressional power.” Id.

See\nShelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2623; United States v.

As the panel opinion details, the incident began with a racial epithet and\na missed-punch. The views and actions of the three Defendants are unarguably\nreprehensible, and punishable under Texas law.4 But whether their distasteful\nactions may be constitutionally punished under federal law is by no means a\nfrivolous question.5 See Hatch, 722 F.3d at 1201.\n       As Cannon points out, “[a]s repugnant as ‘hate crimes’ may be, the\nConstitution does not vest authority in the federal government to prosecute such\ncrimes without a federal nexus. We entrust the prosecution of some of the most\nheinous crimes, including murders, rapes, arson, and assaults, to our state\ncriminal justice systems. Indeed, at least forty five (45) states have criminal\nstatutes that impose harsher penalties for crimes that are motivated by bias\nincluding Texas.” (citing Anti-Defamation League, State Hate Crime Provisions\n(April 28, 2009)).\n                                           III.\n       In Shelby County, the Supreme Court recognized that federal regulations\nthat implicate areas of traditional state power may have profound impacts on\nthe balance of federalism:\n\n\n\n       4\n       The record here shows that Defendants were charged in Harris County, Texas, with\nmisdemeanor assault under state law, and those charges were dropped only after the\ngovernment brought federal hate crime charges against Defendants.\n       5\n        This in no way diminishes the insult and assault that Johnson was made to suffer at\nthe hands of Defendants. As counsel for Cannon readily admits, “[D]efendants are obnoxious\npeople who hold and openly display offensive opinions about racial inequality.”\n\n                                            31\n\f    Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543      Page: 32    Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 12-20514\n      [T]he Constitution provides that all powers not specifically granted\n      to the Federal Government are reserved to the States or citizens.\n      This allocation of powers in our federal system preserves the\n      integrity, dignity, and residual sovereignty of the States. But the\n      federal balance is not just an end in itself: Rather, federalism\n      secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of\n      sovereign power.\n\nShelby Cnty., 133 S. Ct. at 2623 (internal citations and quotation marks\nomitted). Just as “the Framers of the Constitution intended the States to keep\nfor themselves, as provided in the Tenth Amendment, the power to regulate\nelections” so too did they intend for the general police powers to lie with the\nStates.

Thus,\nin both Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117927\"><a href=\"/opinion/117927/united-states-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Morrison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118363\"><a href=\"/opinion/118363/united-states-v-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that Congress does not have the authority under the Commerce\nClause to regulate isolated, local activities without a federal nexus. See Lopez,\n514 U.S. at 551 (striking down the Gun–Free School Zones Act as an\nimpermissible attempt to exercise “general federal police power”); Morrison, 529\nU.S. at 605 (striking down the Violence Against Women Act which provided a\nfederal civil remedy to victims of “violence motivated by gender”); see also Hatch,\n722 F.3d at 1203–04.        As the Lopez Court explained, “[t]o uphold the\nGovernment’s contentions here, we would have to pile inference upon inference\nin a manner that would bid fair to convert congressional authority under the\nCommerce Clause to a general police power of the sort retained by the States.”\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 567. Although the Supreme Court acknowledged that it had\nheld that Congress’s Commerce Clause powers were broad, it declined to extend\nthem further, because “[t]o do so would require us to conclude that the\nConstitution’s enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not\nenumerated, and that there never will be a distinction between what is truly\nnational and what is truly local.” Id. at 567–68 (citations omitted).\n      The breadth of Congress’s power is even more pronounced in this case\nbecause Congress did not pass § 249(a)(1) under the Commerce Clause, as it did\nwith § 249(a)(2). In contrast to § 249(a)(2), § 249(a)(1) does not contain a specific\nrequirement that the conduct involve interstate or foreign travel, use a channel,\nfacility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign commerce, or invoke the\n\n                                         33\n\f    Case: 12-20514    Document: 00512607543       Page: 34   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 12-20514\nspecial maritime or territorial jurisdiction of the United States. Compare 18\nU.S.C. § 249(a)(2)(B)(i)(I)-(III) with § 249(a)(1). Unlike the Commerce Clause,\nthe Congress’s power under the Thirteenth Amendment is not limited to\ninterstate activities. Unlike the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not limited to\nstate action. Unlike the Fifteenth Amendment, it does not require Congress to\nact based on a need grounded in current conditions. Congress’s power under the\nThirteenth Amendment is constrained only by the definition of “badges” or\n“incidents” of slavery. See Jones, 392 U.S. at 440; see generally Rutherglen,\nsupra at 1367. And under Jones, that definition only a self-imposed limit.\nCongress’s powers are constrained only by Congress.\n                                        IV.\n\n      In conclusion, I do not write this special concurrence to suggest that\nracially motivated crimes of hate are anything other than despicable acts. I\nwrite instead to point out the tensions between several lines of the Supreme\nCourt’s constitutional jurisprudence. There is tension between the divergent\napplication of nearly identical language in the Reconstruction Amendments.\nThere is tension between Shelby County’s emphasis on current conditions, and\nthe congressional findings supporting the Shepard-Byrd Act, which are grounded\nin the past. There is tension between the limits that Flores places on Congress’s\nability to define the scope of its powers, and its ability to interpret “badges” and\n“incidents” under Jones. There is tension between the limits placed on the\nability of the federal government to intrude into the states’ police powers under\nMorrison and Lopez, and its power to do so here.\n      In this case, the federal law reaches acts between private actors, within\nthe heart of the states’ traditional police powers, without any findings that\nstates currently and consistently fail to adequately address the problem. The\nfederal law does not profess to rely on Congress’s Commerce Clause authority;\n\n\n                                        34\n\f   Case: 12-20514     Document: 00512607543     Page: 35   Date Filed: 04/24/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 12-20514\ninstead, § 249(a)(1) relies on a constitutional provision where Congress has been\ngiven the power to set its own parameters.        While such a law is clearly\npermissible under existing Thirteenth Amendment precedent, there is\nsubstantial tension with other lines of recent constitutional jurisprudence. See\nHatch, 722 F.3d at 1201 (“While Hatch’s arguments raise important federalism\nquestions, in light of Jones it will be up to the Supreme Court to choose whether\nto extend its more recent federalism cases to the Thirteenth Amendment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                       35\n\f</pre>",
