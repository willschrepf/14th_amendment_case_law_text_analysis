After Foster’s claim was\noriginally dismissed, Foster appealed, and this court remanded for further findings\nabout whether there was a legitimate penological reason for the search. The district\ncourt* then conducted a bench trial, made factual findings about the search, and\nconcluded Foster’s civil rights were not violated by the search. Foster appeals and\nwe affirm.\n\n      First, Foster claims the district court committed clear error when it found Foster\nknew about the prison’s search policy that inmates should keep their legal and\nnonlegal papers separate. See Randolph v. Kemna, 276 F.3d 401, 403 (8th Cir. 2002)\n(standard of review). At trial, the following exchange occurred between the\ngovernment’s attorney and Foster:\n      Mr. Hill: Mr. Foster, are you familiar with the rules of the search of inmate\n              property within the Iowa prison system?\n      Mr. Foster: Yes, I am.\n      Q:      And you’re aware there’s a distinction between both personal and legal\n              materials, correct?\n      A:      Yes.\n      Q:      And legal materials are searched differently than personal materials,\n              correct?\n      A:      Yes. . . .\n\n      *\n       The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern\nDistrict of Iowa.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      Q:     You knew these rules regarding inmate searches and you knew that\n             personal and legal materials were searched differently on June 23, 1998?\n      A:     Yes.\n\n(Tr. 30-31.) We conclude the district court’s finding that Foster knew of the legal\npaper segregation policy was free from clear error.\n\n       Second, Foster argues the district court committed clear error when it found\nFoster misled prison officials by claiming his two locker boxes (the subject of the\nsearch) contained only legal materials. See Randolph, 276 F.3d at 403 (standard of\nreview). An Iowa prison official testified it was an “ongoing problem” at the time\nFoster’s belongings were searched that “some inmates got the idea that if they\ndeclared something to be legal, we couldn’t undeclare it, they could make us. . . make\na search of it all in front of them.” (Tr. 66.) Foster’s two locker boxes did contain\nlegal materials–but also mixed in were twelve personal letters, thirty-three magazines,\nand numerous other pieces of nonlegal material. An administrative law judge\nconcluded Foster should be disciplined for providing false information about the\ncontents of his locker boxes in an attempt to impede the prison officials’ search. We\nconclude the district court did not commit clear error by finding Foster misled prison\nofficials about the contents of his two locker boxes.\n\n       Third, Foster contends the district court committed clear error when it found\nprison officials separated Foster’s legal from nonlegal materials and did not search\nthe legal materials outside Foster’s presence. See Randolph, 276 F.3d at 403\n(standard of review). The prison officials’ reports and testimony establish that after\nthe prison officials realized Foster’s legal and nonlegal materials were mixed\ntogether, the officials removed all materials from Foster’s presence and separated the\nlegal materials from the nonlegal materials. The officials then left the legal materials\nin Foster’s two locker boxes and took the nonlegal materials to the investigation\noffice where the nonlegal materials alone were thoroughly searched. A prison official\n\n                                          -3-\n\ftestified the legal materials were later searched in Foster’s presence. Because Foster\ndoes not present any evidence to the contrary, we conclude the district court’s finding\nis not clearly erroneous.\n\n       Finally, Foster claims the prison lacks a security interest to justify searching\nan inmate’s legal papers outside that inmate’s presence when the inmate has mixed\nnonlegal material in with his legal papers. We review the district court’s conclusion\nde novo and assume for purposes of this part of our discussion that the mere\nseparation of Foster’s legal and nonlegal materials qualifies as a search. See\nRandolph, 276 F.3d at 403 (standard of review). At the time Foster’s materials were\nsearched, Iowa prison officials were bound by the Dee v. Brewer consent decree\nwhich gave inmates the right to be present during a search of their legal materials in\nthe absence of exigent circumstances. Wycoff v. Hedgepeth, 34 F.3d 614, 615 (8th\nCir. 1994). The exigent circumstances exception was based on the prison’s\n“legitimate security interest in searching outside the inmate’s presence for\n[contraband] that may be secreted in an inmate’s legal papers” such as drugs or plans\nfor illegal activity. Id. at 618. “Otherwise, security officials fear, the inmate\npopulation will learn the search techniques employed and devise methods of\nconcealment that will frustrate future searches.” Id.\n\n       Explaining how an inmate’s presence relates to the prison’s security interest,\na prison official testified:\n       For one thing, I don’t want to send the inmate to school on places [a prison\n       official] may look. I don’t want him to be able to distract the officers from\n       looking or doing – he may notice during the shakedown that one particular\n       officer always forgets to look in a certain place or that more than one does, and\n       I don’t want the inmates to know. If there is a weakness in someone’s\n       particular methods, he doesn’t need to know that so then he knows where to\n       hide his contraband.\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f(Tr. 67). The Dee v. Brewer consent decree and relevant caselaw protect an inmate’s\nright to maintain the privacy of his or her legal materials. Foster, in an effort to be\npresent for a search of his nonlegal materials, attempted to take advantage of this\nprotection by mixing his legal and nonlegal materials together. Foster’s deception\ncreated exigent circumstances which gave the prison officials a legitimate security\ninterest in searching Foster’s legal materials outside of his presence.\n\n      Based on the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court’s well-reasoned\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f",
