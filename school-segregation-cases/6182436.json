The three named plaintiffs brought a purported class action alleging\nthat the developers of their neighborhoods created agreements that violated both state and federal\nlaw by requiring the neighborhoods’ homeowners to pay for basic telecommunications services\nprovided by Crystal Clear Technologies, LLC (“Crystal Clear”), an entity owned and controlled\nby the developers. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ federal claims for failure to state a\nclaim and subsequently denied as futile the plaintiffs’ motion seeking leave to file an amended\ncomplaint. We affirm in part and reverse in part the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nmotion seeking leave to file an amended complaint.\n\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       The plaintiffs are homeowners in three centrally-planned neighborhoods in Thompson’s\nStation, a small town in Williamson County, Tennessee. The three neighborhoods, Canterbury,\nBridgemore, and Tollgate, have hundreds of houses and over a thousand homeowners.\n\n       Carbine & Associates, LLC, developed the neighborhoods through affiliated companies,\nBridgemore Development Group, LLC, Tollgate Farms, LLC, and Hood Development, LLC.\nThe developers also established and controlled owners’ associations for the neighborhoods.\nHowever, the developers have since transferred control of the owners’ associations to third-party\nentities not controlled by either the developers or homeowners.\n\n       From 2006 to 2007, while under the developers’ control, the owners’ associations each\nentered into communications services agreements (the “Agreements”) with Crystal Clear. The\nAgreements grant Crystal Clear the right to provide telecommunications services to the\n\f No. 16-6714              Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 3\n\n\nneighborhoods for twenty-five years, with an option for Crystal Clear to unilaterally renew for an\nadditional twenty-five years. In addition, the Agreements authorize Crystal Clear to be the\nexclusive agent for homeowners in procuring services from any outside providers and grant\nCrystal Clear the exclusive right to market services within the neighborhoods.         Under the\nAgreements, homeowners must pay the owners’ associations a monthly assessment fee, which\nthe associations then use to pay Crystal Clear for basic telecommunications services.\nHomeowners must pay the fee whether they use Crystal Clear’s services or not. In addition,\nhomeowners must make a one-time payment of $1,500 to Crystal Clear for the cost of\nconstructing the telecommunications infrastructure in the neighborhoods.        To facilitate the\ninfrastructure’s construction, Crystal Clear also obtained a non-exclusive franchise agreement\nwith Thompson’s Station that permitted Crystal Clear to use the service easements within the\nneighborhoods.\n\n       Prior to executing the Agreements, Crystal Clear had no experience in the\ntelecommunications-services industry. To provide services to the neighborhoods, Crystal Clear\ncontracts with another provider, DirecTV, and charges a premium to homeowners in addition to\nthe rate negotiated with DirecTV. Further, Crystal Clear does not provide services outside of the\nneighborhoods at issue in this case.\n\n       The plaintiffs brought this suit and subsequently filed their first amended complaint,\nalleging both state and federal claims. The plaintiffs claimed that the Agreements constituted\nself-dealing, unjust enrichment, unconscionability, unlawful tying, market allocation, and\nunlawful exclusivity.\n\n       The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the first amended complaint failed to\nassert allegations necessary for the federal claims and that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring\nclaims on behalf of the owners’ associations. The district court dismissed the first amended\ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) without addressing the standing\nargument and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.\n\n       The plaintiffs then moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 to alter or amend the\njudgment and under Rule 15 for leave to file a second amended complaint that asserted the same\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                      Page 4\n\n\nfederal claims. The district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion after determining that the second\namended complaint would fail to survive a motion to dismiss and was thus futile. The plaintiffs\ntimely appealed from both the district court’s dismissal and its refusal to allow the second\namended complaint. However, the plaintiffs agree that the second amended complaint reflects\nthe plaintiffs’ most recent and developed pleading for purposes of this appeal. Accordingly, we\nconsider only whether the district court erred in refusing to allow the second amended complaint\nunder Rule 59 and Rule 15. Furthermore, the plaintiffs challenge only the district court’s\ndecisions regarding their tying and exclusivity claims.         Therefore, we do not address the\ndismissal of the market allocation claim.\n\n                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo the denial of a motion seeking to amend a complaint where the denial\nis based on the determination that the amended complaint is futile because it would fail under a\nmotion to dismiss. Winget v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., 537 F.3d 565, 572 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\n       “To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must allege facts that state a claim to relief\nthat is plausible on its face and that, if accepted as true, are sufficient to raise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level.” Bickerstaff v. Lucarelli, 830 F.3d 388, 396 (6th Cir. 2016) (citation\nand internal quotation marks omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads\nfactual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable\nfor the misconduct alleged.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Bell Atl. Corp.\nv. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 556 (2007)).             “This standard ‘does not impose a probability\nrequirement at the pleading stage; it simply calls for enough fact[s] to raise a reasonable\nexpectation that discovery will reveal evidence of illegal [conduct.]’” Ohio Pub. Emps. Ret. Sys.\nv. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp., 830 F.3d 376, 383 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S.\nat 556). This court must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,\naccept its allegations as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.”\nBickerstaff, 830 F.3d at 396 (citation omitted).\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 5\n\n\n       B. Unlawful Tying Under the Sherman Act\n\n       “A tying arrangement is defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product [a tying\nproduct] . . . only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied)\nproduct . . . .” Mich. Division-Monument Builders of N. Am. v. Mich. Cemetery Ass’n, 524 F.3d\n726, 732 (6th Cir. 2008) (quoting N. Pac. Ry. Co. v. United States, 356 U.S. 1, 5–6 (1958)).\n“The typical tying case involve[s] a seller’s attempt to exploit its economic power over one\nproduct or in one market to force a less desirable, tied product on a buyer.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Illegal tying therefore occurs only if the seller has appreciable\neconomic power in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume\nof commerce in the tied market.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). With regard to the\nimpact on the tied market, “the controlling consideration is simply whether a total amount of\nbusiness, substantial enough . . . so as not to be merely de minimis, is foreclosed to competitors\nby the tie . . . .” Fortner Enter., Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., 394 U.S. 495, 501 (1969). This latter\nrequirement “makes no reference to the scope of any particular market or to the share of that\nmarket foreclosed by the tie.” Id.\n\n       Under their tying claim, the plaintiffs allege that the developers used their market power\nover the sale of homes in these neighborhoods to force the homeowners to purchase\ntelecommunications services from Crystal Clear, thereby harming competition for the provision\nof telecommunications services and violating the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. The district court\nfound that the first amended complaint failed to state a tying claim because it did not define the\ntying product market in alleging the defendants’ market power in the sale of homes. The second\namended complaint addressed this by defining the tying product market as centrally-planned\ncommunities within Thompson’s Station. The district court then determined that the second\namended complaint alleges market power in a defined market, but that it is futile because it fails\nto allege a substantial impact on the relevant tied market.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs contest this, arguing that the second amended complaint pleads a\nsubstantial impact on the tied market by alleging that the defendants harmed competition for the\nprovision of telecommunications services.       The defendants contend that the plaintiffs only\npleaded a substantial impact on “telecommunications services in the Neighborhoods” rather than\n\f No. 16-6714                 Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                     Page 6\n\n\n“commerce in the general market within which [telecommunications services] [are] sold.”\n(Crystal Clear Br. 19–20.)\n\n       This court must therefore determine whether the plaintiffs pleaded a substantial impact\nwithin the relevant market for telecommunications services. In doing so, this court is mindful\nthat it must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff . . . and draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.” See Bickerstaff, 830 F.3d at 396. While the\nplaintiffs allege that the arrangement “substantial[ly]” affected “the sale of telecommunications\nin the Neighborhood[s],” the plaintiffs also allege more broadly that the arrangement “ha[s]\nharmed competition for the provision of telecommunications.” (R. 99-1, ¶¶ 90, 94.) The exact\namount of commerce impacted by the tying arrangement is unclear at this stage, but the plaintiffs\nhave alleged that the neighborhoods, and thus the list of potential plaintiffs, include hundreds of\nhouses and over 1,000 homeowners subject to the arrangement.\n\n       We can reasonably infer that alleging harm to particular neighborhoods equates to\nalleging harm to the general market that covers those neighborhoods. By alleging that the\nAgreements forced each household to pay one-time infrastructure fees of at least $1,500 and\nmonthly assessment fees for Crystal Clear’s services, the plaintiffs have pleaded an amount of\ncommerce that would be substantial in both the neighborhoods and the telecommunications\nservices market that covers those neighborhoods in Thompson’s Station, Williamson County, or\nbeyond. See Fortner, 394 U.S. at 502 (“[W]e cannot agree with respondents that a sum of\nalmost $200,000 is paltry or ‘insubstantial.’”); Bell v. Cherokee Aviation Corp., 660 F.2d 1123,\n1130 & n.8 (6th Cir. 1981) (holding that $140,000 over three years, “amount[ing] to little more\nthan $40,000 a year,” is not insubstantial); Thompson v. Metro. Multi-List, Inc., 934 F.2d 1566,\n1578 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that $30,000 to $70,000 is “clearly substantial”). We therefore\nconclude that the plaintiffs have pleaded a substantial impact on the relevant tied market.\n\n       The defendants argue that, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded substantial harm on\nthe relevant tied market, the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs’ defined market\nfor the tying product (the sale of homes) is proper. The proper definition of a tying product\nmarket and whether a defendant has market power within that market are fact-intensive questions\nbest addressed following discovery.        Mich. Division-Monument, 524 F.3d at 733.          This is\n\f No. 16-6714              Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 7\n\n\nbecause the inquiry requires considering both the attributes of the product that make it unique\nfrom others and the geographic market within which consumers may seek comparable products.\nSee id. The plaintiffs allege that the neighborhoods represent the majority of centrally-planned\nneighborhoods that are located in a small-town setting in a county that is otherwise filled with\nmore densely populated communities. The plaintiffs further allege that the neighborhoods are\nunique from others because they provide the homeowners with access to superior area schools\nand local covenants that restrict home construction to houses typically purchased by middle to\nupper-middle income households. As the district court correctly noted, the plaintiffs’ allegations\non the tying product market are plausible on their face.\n\n       C. Exclusivity Under the Federal Telecommunications Act\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has explicit authority to impose\nregulations specifying exclusive conduct that the Federal Telecommunications Act prohibits.\nSee 47 U.S.C. § 548(c)(1); see also Nat. Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. FCC, 567 F.3d 659, 664–\n65 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Pursuant to this authority, the FCC issued the 2007 “Exclusivity Order”\nbarring any cable distributor from “enforc[ing] or execut[ing] any provision in a contract that\ngrants it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service (alone or in combination\nwith other services) . . . .” In the Matter of Exclusive Service Contracts For Provision of Video\nServices in Multiple Dwelling Units and Other Real Estate Developments, 22 FCC Rcd. 20235,\n20251 (2007) (codified by 47 C.F.R. § 76.2000(a)) (hereinafter “Exclusivity Order”).\n\n       The plaintiffs allege that the Agreements violate the Exclusivity Order by making Crystal\nClear the exclusive provider of services for the neighborhoods. The district court dismissed this\nclaim, as alleged in the first amended complaint, noting that both the Agreements and the\nallegations contradicted the plaintiffs’ claim that the Agreements were exclusive contracts.\n\n       As evidence of the arrangement’s exclusivity, the plaintiffs submitted with their proposed\nsecond amended complaint the Agreements and a letter sent by MBSC, the new owner of the\nBridgemore development, stating that Crystal Clear refused “to give up its exclusive easements\nthat enable it to be the only provider in Bridgemore.” (Letter from MBSC, R. 99-7, PageID\n1626.) The district court concluded that the second amended complaint reiterated the allegations\n\f No. 16-6714                Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                 Page 8\n\n\nfrom the previous complaint and would therefore fail under a motion to dismiss. In addition, the\ndistrict court found that the second amended complaint and the plain text of the Agreements\ncontradicted the letter submitted by the plaintiffs.\n\n        “The law is clear that [courts] may consider [a document] which was attached to the\n[c]omplaint . . . in determining whether dismissal is proper.” Williams v. CitiMortgage, Inc.,\n498 F. App’x 532, 536 (6th Cir. 2012) (per curiam); see also In re Omnicare, Inc. Sec. Litig.,\n769 F.3d 455, 466 (6th Cir. 2014). Further, “[w]hen a written instrument contradicts allegations\nin the complaint to which it is attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.” Williams, 498 F.\nApp’x at 536 (quoting N. Ind. Gun & Outdoor Shows, Inc. v. City of S. Bend, 163 F.3d 449, 454\n(7th Cir. 1998) (stating that this rule is “well-settled”)).\n\n        The plaintiffs allege that the Agreements make Crystal Clear the exclusive provider by\ncreating unlawful and unreasonable barriers to entry, such as requiring homeowners to pay for\nservices regardless of usage, referencing Crystal Clear’s easements, and by granting Crystal\nClear the exclusive right to negotiate with providers about access to deliver services to the\nneighborhoods. According to the plaintiffs, the cumulative effect of the barriers makes it both\neconomically and practically unfeasible for any other provider to offer its services.        The\nplaintiffs point to both the Agreements’ terms, which state that Crystal Clear will operate on an\nexclusive basis, and the MBSC letter, which describes Crystal Clear’s easements as exclusive\nand barring other providers.\n\n        As the district court noted, there are several contradictions amongst the plaintiffs’\nallegations and the Agreements’ terms. The plaintiffs allege both that the Agreements make\nCrystal Clear the exclusive provider and that Crystal Clear is not truly a provider, contracting\nwith DirecTV to be the actual provider. The plaintiffs note the Agreements’ terms describing the\narrangement as “exclusive,” but the Agreements’ terms mandate that homeowners must have\naccess to other providers.       The plaintiffs’ allege both that Crystal Clear’s easements are\n“exclusive” and that they are part of a non-exclusive franchise agreement. We conclude that\nthese contradictions foreclose the plaintiffs’ exclusivity claim.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 9\n\n\n       The plaintiffs claim more than explicit exclusivity; they also claim that the structure and\ncumulative effect of the arrangement creates an exclusive provider relationship.          But such\nallegations are insufficient to state an exclusivity claim.       The prohibition imposed by the\nExclusivity Order is limited by its terms to “building exclusivity clauses.” Exclusivity Order,\n22 F.C.C. Rcd. at 20236 n.2. Such clauses “appear in contracts between [multichannel video\nprogramming distributors (“MVPDs”)] and [multiple dwelling unit (“MDU”)] owners or other\nreal estate developments” and “prohibit any other MVPD from any access whatsoever to the\npremises of the MDU building or real estate development.” Id. Assuming Crystal Clear is an\nMVPD, the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to show that the Agreements prohibit any\nother MVPD from “any access whatsoever” to the neighborhoods. Indeed, the Agreements\nspecifically mandate that alternative providers be given access to the neighborhoods.\n\n       The plaintiffs rely on a Fourth Circuit decision holding a defendant liable for violating\nthe Exclusivity Order, but that decision is inapposite. Lansdowne on the Potomac Homeowners\nAss'n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Lansdowne, LLC, 713 F.3d 187, 205–06 (4th Cir. 2013). As the\nFourth Circuit found, the relevant contract in that case contained explicit exclusivity clauses. Id.\nThose clauses were contained in an easement that, unlike here, expressly granted the cable\nprovider the sole right to develop telecommunications infrastructure. Id. at 205. And applicable\nstate law required the court to construe the easement, along with a series of related agreements,\nas a “single, intertwining contract” subject to the Exclusivity Order, notwithstanding the\ndefendant’s argument that easements are not “contracts” subject to the order. Id. Interpreting\nthe easement as part of a contract, the Fourth Circuit had “no difficulty” concluding that the\ncontract contained explicit exclusivity clauses in violation of the Exclusivity Order. Id. In this\ncase, by contrast, the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to show that either the Agreements\nor easements at issue contain explicit exclusivity clauses.        We therefore conclude that the\nplaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded an exclusivity claim.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ motion\nseeking leave to file the second amended complaint on plaintiffs’ tying claim; we affirm the\ndistrict court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ motion seeking leave to file the second amended\n\f No. 16-6714              Cates, et al. v.

BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI concur with the majority’s opinion regarding Plaintiffs’ exclusivity claim. Plaintiffs have failed\nto allege that the communications services agreements (the “Agreements”) grant Crystal Clear an\nimproper “exclusive right to provide” telecommunication services to the developments.\nHowever, in my view, despite multiple opportunities to do so, Plaintiffs have failed to articulate\na suitable market in which the purported antitrust violation took place. Therefore, with respect to\nPlaintiffs’ antitrust tying claim, I respectfully dissent from Part II.B of the majority’s opinion and\nwould hold that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.1\n\n         I would find that Plaintiffs have failed to state an antitrust tying claim because they do\nnot allege that the purported tying arrangement “affects a substantial volume of commerce in the\ntied market.” Mich. Div.-Monument Builders of N. Am. v. Mich. Cemetery Ass’n, 524 F.3d 726,\n732 (6th Cir. 2008) [hereinafter Monument Builders] (citation omitted). With respect to the tied\nmarket, Plaintiffs allege only that “[t]he amount of interstate commerce affected in the market\nfor the sale of lots in the Neighborhood and/or the sale of telecommunications in the\nNeighborhood is substantial.”            While the majority infers “that alleging harm to particular\nneighborhoods equates to alleging harm to the general market that covers those neighborhoods,”\nit cites no case, and I have found none, to support that conclusion.2 Plaintiffs must “defin[e] the\n\n         1\n          As an initial matter, the antitrust and exclusivity claims come to us, in part, as an appeal of a post-\njudgment motion to amend. “When a party seeks to amend a complaint after an adverse judgment, it thus must\nshoulder a heavier burden. Instead of meeting only the modest requirements of Rule 15, the claimant must meet the\nrequirements for reopening a case established by Rules 59 or 60.” Leisure Caviar, LLC v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife\nServ., 616 F.3d 612, 616 (6th Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). Because I would find that the district court did not err\nby dismissing Plaintiffs’ antitrust and exclusivity claims, I would also find that the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside judgment and amend the complaint.\n         2\n          The Tenth Circuit recently rejected a similar argument as “an outdated view of the law,” while reviewing\na Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) motion in In re: Cox Enterprises, Inc., 871 F.3d 1093, 1098 (10th Cir.\n2017). Specifically, the Cox plaintiffs argued that “because Cox makes a substantial amount of money on [the tied\nproduct], the tie necessarily has the requisite potential for anticompetitive effects in the [tied] market.” Id. The\nTenth Circuit disagreed, explaining that “making money from a tying arrangement doesn’t violate § 1 of the\nSherman Act unless the defendant, by doing so, has actually or potentially foreclosed or injured competition in the\ntied-product market.” Id. at 1106. “Because tying claims often present little or no potential to harm competition—\n\f No. 16-6714                  Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                           Page 12\n\n\nrelevant product market and demonstrat[e] the defendant’s power in that market,” and they\n“must also define the relevant geographic market and demonstrate that the defendant’s actions\nproduced anticompetitive effects in that defined area.” Id. at 733 (citing Found. for Interior\nDesign Educ. Research v. Savannah Coll. of Art & Design, 244 F.3d 521, 531 (6th Cir. 2001)).\n“The selected geographic market must ‘both correspond to the commercial realities of the\nindustry and be economically significant.’” Id. (quoting Brown Shoe Co. v. United States,\n370 U.S. 294, 336–37 (1962)).\n\n        “[T]he Neighborhood” is not a relevant geographic market.                     As the district court\nexplained, the relevant geographic market cannot be the area in which Crystal Clear allegedly\nhas exclusive control; it is self-evident that the purported tying arrangement would have a\nsubstantial effect in the location where all purchasers of both the tying and tied product reside,\ni.e. the neighborhoods. This is a facile “pleading maneuver[]” that artificially narrows the\nbroader economic and geographic market for telecommunication services to create a “fictitious\nmarket” in which any sales by Crystal Clear would cause a substantial effect. Apani Sw., Inc. v.\nCoca-Cola Enters., Inc., 300 F.3d 620, 633 (5th Cir. 2002). A geographic market must reflect\nthe commercial realities of the telecommunication-services industry and be economically\nsignificant. Plaintiffs do not allege that the neighborhoods—three residential developments in\nThompson’s Station, a suburb of Nashville—correspond to the commercial realities of the\ntelecommunication-services market, which exists at least in Thompson’s Station if not in the\nlarger geographic area around Nashville. Nor have Plaintiffs alleged facts showing that the\ntelecommunication-services sales in those three residential developments are economically\nsignificant in relation to the broader telecommunication-services market in Thompson’s Station\nor nearby Nashville. See Monument Builders, 524 F.3d at 736; see also Wampler v. Sw. Bell Tel.\nCo., 597 F.3d 741, 745 (5th Cir. 2010).\n\n        Many cases illustrate this rule. For example, in Monument Builders, 524 F.3d at 737, we\nrejected a tying claim because the plaintiffs’ definition of the relevant geographic market was too\nnarrow. The Monument Builders plaintiffs alleged that the defendant cemeteries improperly\n\nand thus, no antitrust concerns—plaintiffs alleging per se unlawful tying arrangements must do more to meet the\nforeclosure element than point to a dollar amount.” Id. at 1106–07 (citing Jefferson Parish Hosp. Dist. No. 2 v.\nHyde, 466 U.S. 2, 15–16 (1984)).\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                  Page 13\n\n\nrequired consumers to purchase a burial memorial from the cemeteries, once they had purchased\na burial plot. We rejected the plaintiffs’ allegation that the relevant geographic market was “each\nindividual cemetery,” id. at 734, because the “uniqueness of location is not in itself adequate to\nestablish market power,” id. at 733 (quoting Baxley-DeLamar Monuments, Inc. v. Am. Cemetery\nAss’n, 938 F.2d 846, 852 (8th Cir. 1991)). Moreover, we found that such a definition improperly\nmerged the geographic-market analysis and the product-market analysis into one determination\nand made proof of a substantial effect on the relevant market unnecessary, holding that: “There\ncan be no competition for the sale of burial lots within a market that contains only one provider\nof burial lots. Market power under these circumstances would be unavoidable.” Id. at 734–35;\nsee also Brokerage Concepts, Inc. v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., 140 F.3d 494, 515 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(finding that “non-contiguous, gerrymandered geographic market consisting solely of the areas\nsurrounding [certain] pharmacies in suburban Philadelphia,” without reference to a market\nperceived by consumers and suppliers, failed as a matter of law (citing Tunis Bros. Co. v. Ford\nMotor Co., 952 F.2d 715, 727 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n       In support of its holding, the Monument Builders court relied on Apani Southwest,\n300 F.3d at 626–27, which addressed a plaintiff’s definition of a geographic market as twenty-\nseven City-owned facilities in Lubbock, Texas, where Coca-Cola was the exclusive provider of\nnonalcoholic beverages. The Apani court characterized the plaintiff’s allegations as an attempt\n“to artificially narrow a broader economic market” and rejected the tying claim because the\nalleged geographic market “did not correspond to the commercial realities of the industry and\nwas not economically significant.”      Id. at 633; see also Double D Spotting Serv., Inc. v.\nSupervalu, Inc., 136 F.3d 554, 560–61 (8th Cir. 1998) (rejecting the trucker plaintiffs’ allegation\nthat the relevant geographic market for “unloading services” was “the Supervalu warehouse in\nUrbandale, Iowa, which is a suburb of Des Moines,” because the “stated geographic market is\ntoo narrow to support a claim of an antitrust violation”).\n\n       Finally, in the more recent case of Wampler v. Southwest Bell Telephone Co., 597 F.3d\n741 (5th Cir. 2010), the Fifth Circuit rejected a Sherman Act conspiracy claim in which the\nresident plaintiffs alleged that the relevant geographic market was a single multi-unit dwelling\n(“MDU”) where AT&T had exclusive access to the communications infrastructure entering the\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                Page 14\n\n\nbuilding. Id. at 743. The Wampler court held that an MDU was not a relevant geographic\nmarket, because “given the competition that exists between MDU owners, the competition that\nexists between service providers, and given the highly mobile nature of today’s society, . . . a\nsingle MDU is [not] so segregated as to be economically significant and thus represent[] a\nplausible geographic market.” Id. at 746; cf. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. v. Kolon Indus.,\nInc., 637 F.3d 435, 444–47 (4th Cir. 2011) (finding sufficient Kolon’s allegation that “the\nrelevant geographic market was ‘worldwide supply of para-aramid fiber to commercial\npurchasers in the United States,’” because Kolon “pled plausible reasons for limiting the\ngeographic market to the United States”).\n\n       Similarly, “the Neighborhood” is not a relevant geographic market for the tied product\n(telecommunication services) at issue here. Plaintiffs do not allege that “the Neighborhood” has\nany relationship to the commercial realities of the telecommunication-services industry or is\neconomically significant in the telecommunication-services market. Plaintiffs, therefore, have\nfailed to allege a relevant geographic market for the sale of telecommunication services, and\ntheir allegations are insufficient to make out a tying claim.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, I concur in part and dissent in part.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v.

Therefore, I\nrespectfully dissent from Part II.C of the majority’s opinion.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       In its 2007 “Exclusivity Order” the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) found\nthat “the greatest harm that exclusivity clauses cause residents of MDUs [multiple dwelling\nunits] is that they deny those residents another choice of MVPD [multichannel video\nprogramming distributor] service and thus deny them the benefits of increased competition.”\nIn the Matter of Exclusive Service Contracts for Provision of Video Services in Multiple\nDwelling Units and Other Real Estate Developments, 22 FCC Rcd. 20235, 20244 (2007)\n(codified at 47 C.F.R. § 76.2000) (hereinafter “Exclusivity Order”). The FCC found that cable\noperators protected by exclusivity clauses faced no pressure to hold down their prices, to provide\ndesired programming, or to offer low-cost bundles of video, voice, and Internet access services.\nId. at 20244–45. Furthermore, the FCC found that exclusivity clauses had the potential to act as\ndeterrents to competitors seeking to enter the marketplace. Id. at 20245. The FCC concluded\nthat these clauses are proscribed by 47 U.S.C. § 548 because “[t]hat Section prohibits unfair\nmethods of competition that have the purpose or effect of hindering significantly or preventing\nMPVDs from providing ‘satellite cable’ and/or ‘satellite broadcast’ programming to subscribers\nand consumers.” Id. at 20236. The FCC, therefore, prohibited cable operators or MVPDs from\n“enforce[ing] or execut[ing] any provision in a contract that grants it the exclusive right to\nprovide any video programming service (alone or in combination with other services) to a\nMDU.” Id. at 20251 (emphasis added). The situation in this case presents exactly the problems\nthe FCC sought to prevent in its Exclusivity Order.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.

Appellant Reply Br. at 7. The majority\nrejects the plaintiffs’ premise that the Exclusivity Order can be violated by a de facto contractual\narrangement, and instead reads the prohibition as applying only to specific clauses that explicitly\ncreate exclusivity standing alone. This interpretation of the regulation ignores the purpose of the\nExclusivity Order and the principles of Tennessee contract law that govern our interpretation of\nthe CSAs.\n\n       The CSAs are interpreted pursuant to Tennessee law. Cf. Ferro Corp. v. Garrison Indus.,\nInc., 142 F.3d 926, 935 (6th Cir. 1998). “Under Tennessee law . . . the ‘cardinal rule [in\ninterpreting contracts] . . . is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that\nintention, consistent with legal principles.’” Frizzell Constr. Co. v. Gatlinburg, L.L.C., 9 S.W.3d\n79, 85 (Tenn. 1999) (second and third alteration in original) (quoting Bob Pearsall Motors, Inc.\nv. Regal Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 521 S.W.2d 578, 580 (Tenn. 1975)). “In addition, a contract’s\nprovisions must be interpreted in the context of the entire contract, ‘viewed from beginning to\nend and all its terms must pass in review, for one clause may modify, limit or illustrate another.’”\nD&E Constr. Co. v. Robert J. Denley Co., 38 S.W.3d 513, 519 (Tenn. 2001) (quoting Frizzell\nConstr. Co., 9 S.W.3d at 85).\n\n       The CSAs both contain an explicit exclusivity clause. R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA at 1) (Page\nID #1492) (“Association has chosen Crystal Clear Technologies to operate and maintain the\nSystem, and to provide Basic Services (as further defined below) to each home and multi-family\ndwelling unit in Tollgate Village (‘Home’) on an exclusive basis consistent with the terms of this\nAgreement and applicable law.” (emphasis added)); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 1) (Page ID\n#1527) (“Association has chosen Crystal Clear Technologies, LLC to operate and maintain the\nSystem, and to provide Basic Services (as further defined below) to each home and multi-family\ndwelling unit in Bridgemore Village (‘Home’) on an exclusive basis consistent with the terms of\nthis Agreement and applicable law.” (emphasis added)).

Grp., LLC at 14 n.6. The defendants are correct that the exclusivity\nclauses must be interpreted in light of the other contract provisions, D&E Constr. Co., 38 S.W.3d\nat 519, and that some of these provisions do contemplate the theoretical provision of MVPD\nservices by alternative providers, R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA at 7) (Page ID #1498); R. 99-4\n(Bridgemore CSA at 7) (Page ID #1533). In the context of the entire contract, however, these\nexclusivity clauses are clearly designed to “prohibit any other MVPD from any access\nwhatsoever to the premises of the MDU building or real estate development.”1 Exclusivity\nOrder at 20236 n.2.\n\n        First, the CSAs refer to easements that Crystal Clear Technologies obtained in each\nMDU. R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA at 1) (Page ID #1492); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 7) (Page ID\n#1527). The plaintiffs allege that these easements are exclusive and prevent any alternative\nprovider from distributing services in the MDUs.                    R. 99-1 (Proposed Second Amended\nComplaint at 27) (Page ID #1467).               To support this factual allegation, the plaintiffs have\nproffered a letter from the current owners of the Bridgemore development discussing the\nexclusive easements. R. 99-7 (Gluck Letter at 3) (Page ID #1626). Under Tennessee law,\ndocuments referred to in a written contract “may be properly considered in the construction of\nthe contract.” Lasco Inc. v. Inman Constr. Corp., 467 S.W.3d 467, 473 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2015)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting McCall v. Towne Square Inc., 503 S.W.2d 180, 183\n(Tenn. 1973)). Thus, the references to these exclusive easements support the plaintiffs’ claim\nthat the CSAs violate the Exclusivity Order.\n\n\n\n        1\n          The majority relies on a footnote in the Exclusivity Order to construe narrowly the prohibition on\nexclusivity clauses. It is true that the Exclusivity Order is limited to “building exclusivity clauses.” Exclusivity\nOrder at 20236 n.2. The FCC has defined building exclusivity clauses as clauses that “prohibit any other MVPD\nfrom any access whatsoever to the premises of the MDU building or real estate development.” Id. Here, the\nprovisions in the CSAs create this outcome de facto and therefore must fall within the parameters of the Exclusivity\nOrder. In other words, the FCC has defined building exclusivity clauses as clauses creating outcome X. The clauses\nhere also produce outcome X. Therefore, these clauses must be subject to the Exclusivity Order because the\nunderlying purpose of 47 U.S.C. § 548 and the Exclusivity Order would be eviscerated if parties could avoid the\nprohibition on exclusivity clauses by creating an exclusivity arrangement via the interaction of multiple contractual\nclauses as opposed to one clause standing on its own.\n\f No. 16-6714                   Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                             Page 18\n\n\n        Second, other contractual provisions limit the ability of homeowners to communicate\ndirectly with alternate service providers, and vice-versa, and instead require communications to\nbe funneled through Crystal Clear Technologies.2 R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA at 8) (Page ID #1499);\nR. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 8) (Page ID #1534).                     Third, the CSAs allow Crystal Clear\nTechnologies to charge alternative providers fees in order to offer services to homeowners.\nR. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA at 8) (Page ID #1499); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 8) (Page ID #1534).\nLastly, the CSAs bind the homeowners for twenty-five years and automatically renew for\nanother twenty-five years; the homeowners cannot terminate the agreements until after the first\ntwenty-five year period and must provide at least one year’s notice to do so. R. 99-3 (Tollgate\nCSA at 16) (Page ID #1507); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 17) (Page ID #1543). Collectively,\nthese provisions, coupled with the explicit exclusivity clauses, demonstrate that the cumulative\npurpose and effect of the CSAs is to create a prohibited exclusivity arrangement.3\n\n        When viewing the CSAs as a whole, it is clear that “the purpose and effect of the\nagreement is to bar competing cable video providers from delivering service to the development\nby preventing them from ever building the infrastructure necessary to reach [the MDUs] in the\nfirst place.” Lansdowne on the Potomac Homeowners Ass’n v. OpenBand at Lansdowne, LLC,\n713 F.3d 187, 205–06 (4th Cir. 2013). The majority seeks to distinguish the facts alleged in this\ncase from the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Lansdowne in which our sister circuit concluded that a\ncontract very similar to the one in this case violated the Exclusivity Order. 713 F.3d at 207.\nThe majority points to differences that create no meaningful distinctions. Like the contested\n\n        2\n          This is different from the exclusive marketing arrangements created by the CSAs, R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA\nat 6) (Page ID #1497); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 6) (Page ID #1532), which are permitted by the FCC. In the\nMatter of Exclusive Service Contracts for Provision of Video Services in Multiple Dwelling Units and Other Real\nEstate Developments: Second Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd. 2460, 2471–73 (2010) (hereinafter “Bulk Billing and\nExclusive Marketing Arrangements Order”).\n        3\n          The plaintiffs also point to the provision in each CSA that requires them to pay Crystal Clear\nTechnologies regardless of whether they actually use the company’s services. Appellants Br. at 8; R. 99-3 (Tollgate\nCSA at 10) (Page ID #1501); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 10) (Page ID #1536). The FCC allows such mandatory\nfees as part of acceptable bulk billing arrangements. Bulk Billing and Exclusive Marketing Arrangements Order at\n2465. Thus, this provision on its own does not support the plaintiffs’ argument. The existence of a bulk billing\narrangement, however, does not immunize the CSAs from the Exclusivity Order. Bulk billing arrangements must\ncomply with the prohibitions articulated in the Exclusivity Order. Id. at 2465 & n.15. The FCC distinguished\nacceptable bulk billing arrangements from prohibited exclusivity clauses because acceptable bulk billing\narrangements do not prevent alternative providers from providing services to homeowners nor do they stop\nhomeowners from purchasing services from other providers. Id. at 2468.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                     Page 19\n\n\nagreements at issue in Lansdowne, the CSAs here have explicit exclusivity clauses.\nFurthermore, as in Lansdowne, when the CSAs are interpreted pursuant to applicable state law\nthe clear conclusion is that they create a prohibited exclusivity arrangement notwithstanding\nsome of the language in the CSAs to the contrary. When interpreted as a whole, the agreement\nproduces “precisely the type of anti-competitive monopoly that the FCC sought to prohibit.”\nLansdowne, 713 F.3d at 205.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Defendants Tollgate Village Association Inc. and Bridgemore Village Owners’\nAssociation Inc.—the respective homeowners’ associations of the MDUs—argue that the\nplaintiffs lack standing to assert a derivative claim against them. Br. of Tollgate Vill. Ass’n Inc.\n& Bridgemore Vill. Owners’ Ass’n Inc. at 29. The majority did not need to reach this argument.\nI do, and conclude that the plaintiffs are bringing a direct claim—not a derivative claim—and\ntherefore this argument is inapposite.\n\n       Under Tennessee law, the difference between a direct and a derivative claim is premised\non “the nature of the wrong and to whom the relief should go.” Keller v. Estate of McRedmond,\n495 S.W.3d 852, 876 (Tenn. 2016) (quoting Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrett, Inc.,\n845 A.2d 1037, 1039 (Del. 2004)). In a derivative suit, the wrong is suffered by the corporation\nand the harm to the shareholder is “merely incidental to the wrong suffered by the corporation\nand affects all stockholders alike.” Id. at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, in\na direct action, the shareholder is the one who suffered the injury and any recovery would go to\nthat injured shareholder. Id. at 868–69.\n\n       Here, the plaintiffs are asserting a direct action. They allege that they have directly\nsuffered injuries, as opposed to the homeowners’ associations. See, e.g., R. 99-1 (Proposed\nSecond Amended Complaint at 14) (Page ID #1454). Any recovery that the plaintiffs would win\nwould inure to their benefit and not to the benefit of the homeowners’ associations.\nConsequently, this is a direct claim under Tennessee law, and the argument of the homeowners’\nassociations about the plaintiffs’ lack of standing to assert a derivative claim is misplaced.\n\f No. 16-6714                Cates, et al. v.

The three named plaintiffs brought a purported class action alleging\nthat the developers of their neighborhoods created agreements that violated both state and federal\nlaw by requiring the neighborhoods’ homeowners to pay for basic telecommunications services\nprovided by Crystal Clear Technologies, LLC (“Crystal Clear”), an entity owned and controlled\nby the developers. The district court dismissed the plaintiffs’ federal claims for failure to state a\nclaim and subsequently denied as futile the plaintiffs’ motion seeking leave to file an amended\ncomplaint. We affirm in part and reverse in part the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’\nmotion seeking leave to file an amended complaint.\n\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       The plaintiffs are homeowners in three centrally-planned neighborhoods in Thompson’s\nStation, a small town in Williamson County, Tennessee. The three neighborhoods, Canterbury,\nBridgemore, and Tollgate, have hundreds of houses and over a thousand homeowners.\n\n       Carbine & Associates, LLC, developed the neighborhoods through affiliated companies,\nBridgemore Development Group, LLC, Tollgate Farms, LLC, and Hood Development, LLC.\nThe developers also established and controlled owners’ associations for the neighborhoods.\nHowever, the developers have since transferred control of the owners’ associations to third-party\nentities not controlled by either the developers or homeowners.\n\n       From 2006 to 2007, while under the developers’ control, the owners’ associations each\nentered into communications services agreements (the “Agreements”) with Crystal Clear. The\nAgreements grant Crystal Clear the right to provide telecommunications services to the\n\f No. 16-6714              Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 3\n\n\nneighborhoods for twenty-five years, with an option for Crystal Clear to unilaterally renew for an\nadditional twenty-five years. In addition, the Agreements authorize Crystal Clear to be the\nexclusive agent for homeowners in procuring services from any outside providers and grant\nCrystal Clear the exclusive right to market services within the neighborhoods.         Under the\nAgreements, homeowners must pay the owners’ associations a monthly assessment fee, which\nthe associations then use to pay Crystal Clear for basic telecommunications services.\nHomeowners must pay the fee whether they use Crystal Clear’s services or not. In addition,\nhomeowners must make a one-time payment of $1,500 to Crystal Clear for the cost of\nconstructing the telecommunications infrastructure in the neighborhoods.        To facilitate the\ninfrastructure’s construction, Crystal Clear also obtained a non-exclusive franchise agreement\nwith Thompson’s Station that permitted Crystal Clear to use the service easements within the\nneighborhoods.\n\n       Prior to executing the Agreements, Crystal Clear had no experience in the\ntelecommunications-services industry. To provide services to the neighborhoods, Crystal Clear\ncontracts with another provider, DirecTV, and charges a premium to homeowners in addition to\nthe rate negotiated with DirecTV. Further, Crystal Clear does not provide services outside of the\nneighborhoods at issue in this case.\n\n       The plaintiffs brought this suit and subsequently filed their first amended complaint,\nalleging both state and federal claims. The plaintiffs claimed that the Agreements constituted\nself-dealing, unjust enrichment, unconscionability, unlawful tying, market allocation, and\nunlawful exclusivity.\n\n       The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the first amended complaint failed to\nassert allegations necessary for the federal claims and that the plaintiffs lack standing to bring\nclaims on behalf of the owners’ associations. The district court dismissed the first amended\ncomplaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) without addressing the standing\nargument and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims.\n\n       The plaintiffs then moved under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 to alter or amend the\njudgment and under Rule 15 for leave to file a second amended complaint that asserted the same\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                      Page 4\n\n\nfederal claims. The district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion after determining that the second\namended complaint would fail to survive a motion to dismiss and was thus futile. The plaintiffs\ntimely appealed from both the district court’s dismissal and its refusal to allow the second\namended complaint. However, the plaintiffs agree that the second amended complaint reflects\nthe plaintiffs’ most recent and developed pleading for purposes of this appeal. Accordingly, we\nconsider only whether the district court erred in refusing to allow the second amended complaint\nunder Rule 59 and Rule 15. Furthermore, the plaintiffs challenge only the district court’s\ndecisions regarding their tying and exclusivity claims.         Therefore, we do not address the\ndismissal of the market allocation claim.\n\n                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Standard of Review\n\n       We review de novo the denial of a motion seeking to amend a complaint where the denial\nis based on the determination that the amended complaint is futile because it would fail under a\nmotion to dismiss.

Unlawful Tying Under the Sherman Act\n\n       “A tying arrangement is defined as an agreement by a party to sell one product [a tying\nproduct] . . . only on the condition that the buyer also purchases a different (or tied)\nproduct . . . .” Mich.

(internal\nquotation marks omitted). “Illegal tying therefore occurs only if the seller has appreciable\neconomic power in the tying product market and if the arrangement affects a substantial volume\nof commerce in the tied market.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). With regard to the\nimpact on the tied market, “the controlling consideration is simply whether a total amount of\nbusiness, substantial enough . . . so as not to be merely de minimis, is foreclosed to competitors\nby the tie . . . .” Fortner Enter., Inc. v. U.S. Steel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107895\"><a href=\"/opinion/107895/fortner-enterprises-inc-v-united-states-steel-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 501 (1969). This latter\nrequirement “makes no reference to the scope of any particular market or to the share of that\nmarket foreclosed by the tie.” Id.\n\n       Under their tying claim, the plaintiffs allege that the developers used their market power\nover the sale of homes in these neighborhoods to force the homeowners to purchase\ntelecommunications services from Crystal Clear, thereby harming competition for the provision\nof telecommunications services and violating the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. The district court\nfound that the first amended complaint failed to state a tying claim because it did not define the\ntying product market in alleging the defendants’ market power in the sale of homes. The second\namended complaint addressed this by defining the tying product market as centrally-planned\ncommunities within Thompson’s Station. The district court then determined that the second\namended complaint alleges market power in a defined market, but that it is futile because it fails\nto allege a substantial impact on the relevant tied market.\n\n       On appeal, the plaintiffs contest this, arguing that the second amended complaint pleads a\nsubstantial impact on the tied market by alleging that the defendants harmed competition for the\nprovision of telecommunications services.       The defendants contend that the plaintiffs only\npleaded a substantial impact on “telecommunications services in the Neighborhoods” rather than\n\f No. 16-6714                 Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                     Page 6\n\n\n“commerce in the general market within which [telecommunications services] [are] sold.”\n(Crystal Clear Br. 19–20.)\n\n       This court must therefore determine whether the plaintiffs pleaded a substantial impact\nwithin the relevant market for telecommunications services. In doing so, this court is mindful\nthat it must “construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff . . . and draw all\nreasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.” See Bickerstaff, 830 F.3d at 396. While the\nplaintiffs allege that the arrangement “substantial[ly]” affected “the sale of telecommunications\nin the Neighborhood[s],” the plaintiffs also allege more broadly that the arrangement “ha[s]\nharmed competition for the provision of telecommunications.” (R. 99-1, ¶¶ 90, 94.) The exact\namount of commerce impacted by the tying arrangement is unclear at this stage, but the plaintiffs\nhave alleged that the neighborhoods, and thus the list of potential plaintiffs, include hundreds of\nhouses and over 1,000 homeowners subject to the arrangement.\n\n       We can reasonably infer that alleging harm to particular neighborhoods equates to\nalleging harm to the general market that covers those neighborhoods. By alleging that the\nAgreements forced each household to pay one-time infrastructure fees of at least $1,500 and\nmonthly assessment fees for Crystal Clear’s services, the plaintiffs have pleaded an amount of\ncommerce that would be substantial in both the neighborhoods and the telecommunications\nservices market that covers those neighborhoods in Thompson’s Station, Williamson County, or\nbeyond. See Fortner, 394 U.S. at 502 (“[W]e cannot agree with respondents that a sum of\nalmost $200,000 is paltry or ‘insubstantial.’”); Bell v.

We therefore\nconclude that the plaintiffs have pleaded a substantial impact on the relevant tied market.\n\n       The defendants argue that, even if the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded substantial harm on\nthe relevant tied market, the district court erred in concluding that the plaintiffs’ defined market\nfor the tying product (the sale of homes) is proper. The proper definition of a tying product\nmarket and whether a defendant has market power within that market are fact-intensive questions\nbest addressed following discovery.        Mich. Division-Monument, 524 F.3d at 733.          This is\n\f No. 16-6714              Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 7\n\n\nbecause the inquiry requires considering both the attributes of the product that make it unique\nfrom others and the geographic market within which consumers may seek comparable products.\nSee id. The plaintiffs allege that the neighborhoods represent the majority of centrally-planned\nneighborhoods that are located in a small-town setting in a county that is otherwise filled with\nmore densely populated communities. The plaintiffs further allege that the neighborhoods are\nunique from others because they provide the homeowners with access to superior area schools\nand local covenants that restrict home construction to houses typically purchased by middle to\nupper-middle income households. As the district court correctly noted, the plaintiffs’ allegations\non the tying product market are plausible on their face.\n\n       C. Exclusivity Under the Federal Telecommunications Act\n\n       The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) has explicit authority to impose\nregulations specifying exclusive conduct that the Federal Telecommunications Act prohibits.\nSee 47 U.S.C. § 548(c)(1); see also Nat. Cable & Telecomm. Ass’n v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187360\"><a href=\"/opinion/187360/nat-cable-telecommunications-assoc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 664–\n65 (D.C. Cir. 2009). Pursuant to this authority, the FCC issued the 2007 “Exclusivity Order”\nbarring any cable distributor from “enforc[ing] or execut[ing] any provision in a contract that\ngrants it the exclusive right to provide any video programming service (alone or in combination\nwith other services) . . . .” In the Matter of Exclusive Service Contracts For Provision of Video\nServices in Multiple Dwelling Units and Other Real Estate Developments, 22 FCC Rcd. 20235,\n20251 (2007) (codified by 47 C.F.R. § 76.2000(a)) (hereinafter “Exclusivity Order”).\n\n       The plaintiffs allege that the Agreements violate the Exclusivity Order by making Crystal\nClear the exclusive provider of services for the neighborhoods. The district court dismissed this\nclaim, as alleged in the first amended complaint, noting that both the Agreements and the\nallegations contradicted the plaintiffs’ claim that the Agreements were exclusive contracts.\n\n       As evidence of the arrangement’s exclusivity, the plaintiffs submitted with their proposed\nsecond amended complaint the Agreements and a letter sent by MBSC, the new owner of the\nBridgemore development, stating that Crystal Clear refused “to give up its exclusive easements\nthat enable it to be the only provider in Bridgemore.” (Letter from MBSC, R. 99-7, PageID\n1626.) The district court concluded that the second amended complaint reiterated the allegations\n\f No. 16-6714                Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                 Page 8\n\n\nfrom the previous complaint and would therefore fail under a motion to dismiss. In addition, the\ndistrict court found that the second amended complaint and the plain text of the Agreements\ncontradicted the letter submitted by the plaintiffs.\n\n        “The law is clear that [courts] may consider [a document] which was attached to the\n[c]omplaint . . . in determining whether dismissal is proper.” Williams v. CitiMortgage, Inc.,\n498 F. App’x 532, 536 (6th Cir. 2012) (per curiam); see also In re Omnicare, Inc. Sec. Litig.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">769</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">455</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466 (6th Cir. 2014). Further, “[w]hen a written instrument contradicts allegations\nin the complaint to which it is attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.” Williams, 498 F.\nApp’x at 536 (quoting N. Ind. Gun & Outdoor Shows, Inc. v. City of S. Bend, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760151\"><a href=\"/opinion/760151/northern-indiana-gun-outdoor-shows-inc-v-city-of-south-bend-stephen/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454\n(7th Cir. 1998) (stating that this rule is “well-settled”)).\n\n        The plaintiffs allege that the Agreements make Crystal Clear the exclusive provider by\ncreating unlawful and unreasonable barriers to entry, such as requiring homeowners to pay for\nservices regardless of usage, referencing Crystal Clear’s easements, and by granting Crystal\nClear the exclusive right to negotiate with providers about access to deliver services to the\nneighborhoods. According to the plaintiffs, the cumulative effect of the barriers makes it both\neconomically and practically unfeasible for any other provider to offer its services.        The\nplaintiffs point to both the Agreements’ terms, which state that Crystal Clear will operate on an\nexclusive basis, and the MBSC letter, which describes Crystal Clear’s easements as exclusive\nand barring other providers.\n\n        As the district court noted, there are several contradictions amongst the plaintiffs’\nallegations and the Agreements’ terms. The plaintiffs allege both that the Agreements make\nCrystal Clear the exclusive provider and that Crystal Clear is not truly a provider, contracting\nwith DirecTV to be the actual provider. The plaintiffs note the Agreements’ terms describing the\narrangement as “exclusive,” but the Agreements’ terms mandate that homeowners must have\naccess to other providers.       The plaintiffs’ allege both that Crystal Clear’s easements are\n“exclusive” and that they are part of a non-exclusive franchise agreement. We conclude that\nthese contradictions foreclose the plaintiffs’ exclusivity claim.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                    Page 9\n\n\n       The plaintiffs claim more than explicit exclusivity; they also claim that the structure and\ncumulative effect of the arrangement creates an exclusive provider relationship.          But such\nallegations are insufficient to state an exclusivity claim.       The prohibition imposed by the\nExclusivity Order is limited by its terms to “building exclusivity clauses.” Exclusivity Order,\n22 F.C.C. Rcd. at 20236 n.2. Such clauses “appear in contracts between [multichannel video\nprogramming distributors (“MVPDs”)] and [multiple dwelling unit (“MDU”)] owners or other\nreal estate developments” and “prohibit any other MVPD from any access whatsoever to the\npremises of the MDU building or real estate development.” Id. Assuming Crystal Clear is an\nMVPD, the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to show that the Agreements prohibit any\nother MVPD from “any access whatsoever” to the neighborhoods. Indeed, the Agreements\nspecifically mandate that alternative providers be given access to the neighborhoods.\n\n       The plaintiffs rely on a Fourth Circuit decision holding a defendant liable for violating\nthe Exclusivity Order, but that decision is inapposite. Lansdowne on the Potomac Homeowners\nAss'n, Inc. v. OpenBand at Lansdowne, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205–06 (4th Cir. 2013). As the\nFourth Circuit found, the relevant contract in that case contained explicit exclusivity clauses. Id.\nThose clauses were contained in an easement that, unlike here, expressly granted the cable\nprovider the sole right to develop telecommunications infrastructure. Id. at 205. And applicable\nstate law required the court to construe the easement, along with a series of related agreements,\nas a “single, intertwining contract” subject to the Exclusivity Order, notwithstanding the\ndefendant’s argument that easements are not “contracts” subject to the order. Id. Interpreting\nthe easement as part of a contract, the Fourth Circuit had “no difficulty” concluding that the\ncontract contained explicit exclusivity clauses in violation of the Exclusivity Order. Id. In this\ncase, by contrast, the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to show that either the Agreements\nor easements at issue contain explicit exclusivity clauses.        We therefore conclude that the\nplaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded an exclusivity claim.\n\n                                       III.

It is true that the Exclusivity Order is limited to “building exclusivity clauses.” Exclusivity\nOrder at 20236 n.2. The FCC has defined building exclusivity clauses as clauses that “prohibit any other MVPD\nfrom any access whatsoever to the premises of the MDU building or real estate development.” Id. Here, the\nprovisions in the CSAs create this outcome de facto and therefore must fall within the parameters of the Exclusivity\nOrder. In other words, the FCC has defined building exclusivity clauses as clauses creating outcome X. The clauses\nhere also produce outcome X. Therefore, these clauses must be subject to the Exclusivity Order because the\nunderlying purpose of 47 U.S.C. § 548 and the Exclusivity Order would be eviscerated if parties could avoid the\nprohibition on exclusivity clauses by creating an exclusivity arrangement via the interaction of multiple contractual\nclauses as opposed to one clause standing on its own.\n\f No. 16-6714                   Cates, et al. v.

Collectively,\nthese provisions, coupled with the explicit exclusivity clauses, demonstrate that the cumulative\npurpose and effect of the CSAs is to create a prohibited exclusivity arrangement.3\n\n        When viewing the CSAs as a whole, it is clear that “the purpose and effect of the\nagreement is to bar competing cable video providers from delivering service to the development\nby preventing them from ever building the infrastructure necessary to reach [the MDUs] in the\nfirst place.” Lansdowne on the Potomac Homeowners Ass’n v. OpenBand at Lansdowne, LLC,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 205–06 (4th Cir. 2013). The majority seeks to distinguish the facts alleged in this\ncase from the Fourth Circuit’s decision in Lansdowne in which our sister circuit concluded that a\ncontract very similar to the one in this case violated the Exclusivity Order. 713 F.3d at 207.\nThe majority points to differences that create no meaningful distinctions. Like the contested\n\n        2\n          This is different from the exclusive marketing arrangements created by the CSAs, R. 99-3 (Tollgate CSA\nat 6) (Page ID #1497); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 6) (Page ID #1532), which are permitted by the FCC. In the\nMatter of Exclusive Service Contracts for Provision of Video Services in Multiple Dwelling Units and Other Real\nEstate Developments: Second Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd. 2460, 2471–73 (2010) (hereinafter “Bulk Billing and\nExclusive Marketing Arrangements Order”).\n        3\n          The plaintiffs also point to the provision in each CSA that requires them to pay Crystal Clear\nTechnologies regardless of whether they actually use the company’s services. Appellants Br. at 8; R. 99-3 (Tollgate\nCSA at 10) (Page ID #1501); R. 99-4 (Bridgemore CSA at 10) (Page ID #1536). The FCC allows such mandatory\nfees as part of acceptable bulk billing arrangements. Bulk Billing and Exclusive Marketing Arrangements Order at\n2465. Thus, this provision on its own does not support the plaintiffs’ argument. The existence of a bulk billing\narrangement, however, does not immunize the CSAs from the Exclusivity Order. Bulk billing arrangements must\ncomply with the prohibitions articulated in the Exclusivity Order. Id. at 2465 & n.15. The FCC distinguished\nacceptable bulk billing arrangements from prohibited exclusivity clauses because acceptable bulk billing\narrangements do not prevent alternative providers from providing services to homeowners nor do they stop\nhomeowners from purchasing services from other providers. Id. at 2468.\n\f No. 16-6714               Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                     Page 19\n\n\nagreements at issue in Lansdowne, the CSAs here have explicit exclusivity clauses.\nFurthermore, as in Lansdowne, when the CSAs are interpreted pursuant to applicable state law\nthe clear conclusion is that they create a prohibited exclusivity arrangement notwithstanding\nsome of the language in the CSAs to the contrary. When interpreted as a whole, the agreement\nproduces “precisely the type of anti-competitive monopoly that the FCC sought to prohibit.”\nLansdowne, 713 F.3d at 205.\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Defendants Tollgate Village Association Inc. and Bridgemore Village Owners’\nAssociation Inc.—the respective homeowners’ associations of the MDUs—argue that the\nplaintiffs lack standing to assert a derivative claim against them. Br. of Tollgate Vill. Ass’n Inc.\n& Bridgemore Vill. Owners’ Ass’n Inc. at 29. The majority did not need to reach this argument.\nI do, and conclude that the plaintiffs are bringing a direct claim—not a derivative claim—and\ntherefore this argument is inapposite.\n\n       Under Tennessee law, the difference between a direct and a derivative claim is premised\non “the nature of the wrong and to whom the relief should go.” Keller v. Estate of McRedmond,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (Tenn. 2016) (quoting Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrett, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1039 (Del. 2004)). In a derivative suit, the wrong is suffered by the corporation\nand the harm to the shareholder is “merely incidental to the wrong suffered by the corporation\nand affects all stockholders alike.” Id. at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, in\na direct action, the shareholder is the one who suffered the injury and any recovery would go to\nthat injured shareholder. Id. at 868–69.\n\n       Here, the plaintiffs are asserting a direct action. They allege that they have directly\nsuffered injuries, as opposed to the homeowners’ associations. See, e.g., R. 99-1 (Proposed\nSecond Amended Complaint at 14) (Page ID #1454). Any recovery that the plaintiffs would win\nwould inure to their benefit and not to the benefit of the homeowners’ associations.\nConsequently, this is a direct claim under Tennessee law, and the argument of the homeowners’\nassociations about the plaintiffs’ lack of standing to assert a derivative claim is misplaced.\n\f No. 16-6714                Cates, et al. v. Crystal Clear Tech., et al.                  Page 20\n\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from Part II.C of the majority’s opinion,\nand I would reverse the district court’s denial of the plaintiffs’ motion seeking leave to file the\nsecond amended complaint on the plaintiffs’ exclusivity claim as well as on the plaintiffs’ tying\nclaim.\n\f</pre>",
