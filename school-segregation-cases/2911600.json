The controversy arises out of the school district’s\ndelay in notifying the twins’ parents that it would evaluate the\ntwins for disabilities; from the amount of time it took the\nschool district to diagnose them with autism; from the chal-\nlenges that confronted the school district in its implementation\nof an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) for each of\nthe children; and from the school district’s alleged discrimina-\ntion against the children by segregating them into a preschool\nfor developmentally delayed youngsters.\n\n   Appellants JG and NG are twin brothers who exhibited\ndelays in their speech patterns and other developmental diffi-\nculties. On May 3, 2003, their mother took them to a free\nscreening at the Brain Power Community Learning Center\n(“the Center”). The Center offers private services for children\n\f16706       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nwith disabilities. The Center referred the twins to the Douglas\nCounty School District (“the District”) and told their mother\nthat the District had a program for developmentally-delayed\nchildren called the TEDDY program.1\n\n   On May 5, 2003, the twins’ mother went to the District’s\nChild Find Office and received a two-page questionnaire for\neach child. She completed the questionnaires, and the Dis-\ntrict’s Child Find Office confirmed receipt of both question-\nnaires on May 7, 2003. The parties agree that IDEA required\nthe District to provide Appellants with notice of a proposal to\nevaluate the twins and a copy of IDEA’s procedural safe-\nguards on May 7, 2003. 20 U.S.C. § §1415(b)(3), (d)(1)(A)\n(2000). The District, however, did not notify the parents that\nit would conduct evaluations of the twins until August 15,\n2003. IDEA also required the District to evaluate the children\nwithin a reasonable time of the May 7 date. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.343(b) (1999). Although the District began administer-\ning tests to evaluate the twins as early as June 20, 2003, it did\nnot complete until August 15, 2003, any evaluation of the\nchildren. It did not begin to evaluate the twins for autism until\nSeptember 25, 2003.\n\n   The District referred the twins to its Child Find Day on\nJune 20, 2003. The twins’ mother asked if the twins could be\ntested earlier, but the District’s Special Education Teacher\nwho reviewed the twins’ initial forms did not have a high\nlevel of concern and did not advance the test date.\n\n   Without notice that the District would evaluate the twins,\nAppellants obtained private evaluations for the twins from the\nCenter. On May 14, 2003, the Center evaluated the twins, and\nthe twins began receiving special education services one week\nlater.\n  1\n    TEDDY stands for Teaching Early Developmentally Delayed Young-\nsters.\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                 16707\n   On June 20, 2003, the twins attended the District’s Child\nFind Day. Their mother listed “speech development” as her\nprimary concern and crying, tantrumming, and toileting as\nother behavioral issues. She also told the District’s Special\nEducation Teacher that both attended the Center for speech\nproblems. The Special Education Teacher and the School\nSpeech Pathologist each gave tests to the twins and received\na lack of responses. This lack of responses showed that the\ntwins were developmentally delayed, and the Special Educa-\ntion Teacher concluded that she could not conduct further\nscreening at that time. The Special Education Teacher sched-\nuled an assessment meeting on August 15, 2003, to conduct\nmore individualized testing. The Special Education Teacher\ninformally expressed that the District could use the scores\nfrom the tests the Center had administered, but she did not\nmake a specific request for the records.\n\n   Also in mid-June, the Center Discrete Trial Trainer,2 an\nindividual trained in working with autistic children, met the\ntwins. She observed them for several weeks at the Center and\nat home. The Center Discrete Trial Trainer started working\nwith the twins on July 15, 2003, but it took several more\nweeks before she could begin her assessment of either of them\nand another two weeks after that before she implemented dis-\ncrete trial training. Thus, although the Center had begun test-\ning the twins for autism in May, it was still assessing the\ntwins for autism in July.\n\n   By late July, some of the Center staff believed that the\ntwins were autistic. On July 28, 2003, the Director of the Cen-\nter contacted the District’s Special Education Director and\nrelayed the Center’s suspicions. The Director of the Center\nsaid that the Center Speech Pathologist, who had worked with\n  2\n    Discrete Trial Training is a commonly-used therapy for Autistic chil-\ndren: The teacher prompts the child, then the child responds with a behav-\nior and finally there is a consequence—some type of positive\nreinforcement.\n\f16708          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthe twins the longest, did not believe that the twins had\nautism. On the same day, the twins’ mother called the District\nto ask if the assessments could be scheduled earlier. The Dis-\ntrict did not change the test date.\n\n   On August 15, 2003, the District conducted an assessment\nof each twin and held an assessment meeting. At that time, the\ntwins’ parents received a copy of the Notice of Parent Rights,\nand their mother signed a “Parent Consent to Evaluate” form.\nThe parents and the Special Education Teacher also filled out\nEarly Childhood Screening Profiles for the twins. The District\nstaff worked with the twins for more than an hour but was\nunable to get responses from either of the twins on many\nquestions. The tests that the staff members were able to\nadminister supported the conclusion that the twins had “devel-\nopmental delays with speech delay as a major concern.”\n\n   Despite the July 28 phone call from the Center, the August\n15 assessments did not include any tests for autism. In fact,\nthe School Special Education Director had not relayed the\nCenter’s suspicions to the School Psychologist, who would\nhave administered any tests for autism. Determining whether\na student has autism requires many assessments and takes a\ngood deal of time. Some of the tests require observation of the\nstudent for more than a month because it is helpful to get to\nknow a child before assessing him or her.3\n\n   On August 25, 2003, the District held an IEP meeting with\nthe twins’ mother. At the meeting, the District presented her\nwith pre-written IEPs as draft copies, and the District found\nthe twins eligible for services under the developmentally\n  3\n    The Center administered the Child Autism Rating Scale autism test on\nthe first day of its evaluations, but the Center’s Discrete Trial Trainer took\nseveral weeks to complete the assessments. The record is unclear when the\nCenter concluded the twins had autism. But the July 28, 2003, conversa-\ntion with the District only relayed that the Center suspected the twins were\nautistic. Thus, the Center was not certain in its diagnosis more than two\nmonths after it began evaluating the children.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT            16709\ndelayed category and offered services. The IEPs did not men-\ntion autism.\n\n   The twins’ mother attended the August 25, 2003, meeting\nwith a binder labeled “Autism,” and the School Psychologist\nasked if there were concerns regarding the twins being autis-\ntic. The twins’ mother responded that the Center staff thought\nthat the twins could be autistic but that they were not sure.\n\n   On August 25, 2003, the twins began attending the Dis-\ntrict’s TEDDY program. They continued receiving services at\nthe Center to supplement the program.\n\n   On September 25, 2003, one month after the School Psy-\nchologist and two months after the Special Education Director\nhad heard about the possibility of autism, the School Psychol-\nogist began assessing the twins for autism. On October 1,\n2003, the parents sent the District a letter stating that the twins\nhad been evaluated as having autism and requesting payment\nfor Center services.\n\n   On October 7, 2003, the District asked the parents to sign\na Consent for Release of Information from the Center. They\nrefused. The twins’ mother agreed, however, to bring the Cen-\nter staff to a meeting on October 8, 2003. At that meeting, the\nCenter shared some data. The parents said that they would not\nprovide more information from the Center unless the District\npaid for it.\n\n   On October 9, 13, and 16, 2003, the School Psychologist\ncompleted several tests to determine whether the twins were\nautistic. She determined that both twins were mildly-\nmoderately autistic. The District began working on new IEPs\nto propose for the twins.\n\n  On October 9, 2003, the Special Education Teacher told the\nmother about her concern that she would not be able to imple-\nment the newly proposed IEP. She became comfortable with\n\f16710       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nher ability to implement the IEPs by early November, after\nlearning that the District would provide her with more train-\ning.\n\n   Both twins began exhibiting new inappropriate behaviors\nduring the week of October 9, 2003. These included choking\ntheir younger brother, stomping on books, and tearing up\nbooks. The twins, however, had improved since they enrolled\nin the TEDDY program, with a decreased resistance to toilet-\ning and an increased ability to follow directions and rules.\n\n   The parents removed the twins from the TEDDY program\non October 13, 2003, expressing concern about the new prob-\nlem behaviors. The parents again asked the District to pay for\nthe twins to attend the Center.\n\n   On October 17, 2003, the District held a meeting to update\nthe twins’ IEPs with the autism results. The District deter-\nmined that both twins were eligible as autistic: the District\nfound JG eligible at an October 21, 2003, meeting and NG\neligible at a November 4, 2003, meeting. The District pro-\nposed new IEPs that added time for discrete trial training,\nextended school year, and functional behavior analysis at the\ntwins’ home and school.\n\n   On October 30, 2003, the twins’ mother called the District\nand asked who would conduct the discrete trial trainings and\nwhere they would be held. The District Program Specialist\nresponded that it had contracted with two private behavior\nanalysts for support in implementing the discrete trial training\nprogram.\n\n   In early November 2003, the parents rejected the twins’\nIEPs. They wanted the Center Discrete Trial Teacher to con-\ntinue working with the twins. The District had considered hir-\ning her, but she did not have early childhood authorization.\nShe was also reluctant to work for the District except in a\nsupervisory role.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT          16711\n   On November 10, 2003, the Special Education Director\nwrote a letter to the parents in which she described the pro-\nposal for a Free Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”),\nrefused to pay for the Center’s services, and stated that the\nDistrict would deliver the discrete trials in a one-on-one and\nsmall group basis.\n\n   The parents stopped sending the twins to the Center in mid-\nNovember because the parents could no longer pay for the\nservices. The parents chose to keep the twins at home, and the\ntwins did not receive any services.\n\n   On December 4, 2003, Appellants requested a due process\nhearing. The Hearing Officer held a hearing from February\n16-20, 2004. She found that the District had committed proce-\ndural violations by not evaluating the twins in a timely man-\nner. She concluded that Appellants should be compensated for\nservices between August 13 and August 25, awarding $800.00\nto compensate for those services.\n\n   The parties appealed, and on September 2, 2004, the State\nReview Officer adopted all of the Hearing Officer’s findings\nof fact but reversed her decision awarding the $800.00. The\nState Review Officer concluded, however, that the District\nhad denied the twins a FAPE when it did not provide Appel-\nlants with a notice of proposal to evaluate and notice of proce-\ndural safeguards on May 7. The State Review Officer ordered\nthe District to compensate Appellants fifty percent of the cost\nof obtaining the Center’s evaluations, a total of $835.\n\n   On September 28, 2004, Appellants appealed to the district\ncourt. They also alleged discrimination in violation of section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The district court\naffirmed the State Review Officer’s decision, granted the Dis-\ntrict’s motion for summary judgment on the discrimination\nclaim, and denied Appellant’s cross-motion for summary\njudgment. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\f16712      JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   On appeal, Appellants argue (1) that the district court\nabused its discretion in reducing their award by fifty percent\nfor equitable reasons and abused its discretion by not award-\ning them the costs of services; (2) that the August 2003 IEPs\nwere not adequate IEPs and did not provide the twins with a\nFAPE; (3) that JG’s October 2003 IEP and NG’s November\n2003 IEP did not provide the twins with a FAPE; and (4) that\nthe district court erred in granting the District’s motion for\nsummary judgment and denying Appellants’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment on the Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record. Van Duyn v. Baker Sch. Dist. 5J, 502\nF.3d 811, 817 (9th Cir. 2007); Amanda J. v. Clark County\nSch. Dist., 267 F.3d 877, 887 (9th Cir. 2001). We review the\ndistrict court’s conclusions of law de novo. Amanda J., 267\nF.3d at 887.\n\n   In IDEA cases, unlike other cases reviewing administrative\naction, we do not employ a highly deferential standard of\nreview. Id. Nevertheless, complete de novo review “is inap-\npropriate.” Id. We give “due weight” to the state administra-\ntive proceedings. Van Duyn, 502 F.3d at 817. “[T]he fact-\nintensive nature of a special education eligibility determina-\ntion coupled with considerations of judicial economy render\na more deferential approach appropriate.” Hood v. Encinitas\nUnion Sch. Dist., 486 F.3d 1099, 1104 n.4 (9th Cir. 2007).\nWe give particular deference to “thorough and careful”\nadministrative findings. R.B. ex rel. F.B. v. Napa Valley Uni-\nfied Sch. Dist., 496 F.3d 932, 937 (9th Cir. 2007) (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                   16713\n                                Analysis\n\n   Children with disabilities are entitled to a free public edu-\ncation, and they are entitled to education designed and tai-\nlored to be appropriate to their disabilities. By these means\ndisabled children will be integrated into society and enhance\ntheir personal well-being and their important societal contri-\nbutions. Congress enacted IDEA to ensure that children with\ndisabilities receive a FAPE. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(1) (2000). The\nSupreme Court has previously said that a FAPE must provide\na “basic floor of opportunity” to disabled students, not a\n“potential-maximizing education.” Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley,\n458 U.S. 176, 201 & n.23 (1982). In cases brought under\n§ 1415(e)(2), we consider, first, whether the state complied\nwith the procedures set forth in the Act,4 and, second, whether\n  4\n  In Amanda J., we stated:\n   In addition to establishing substantive requirements, the IDEA\n   also includes procedural safeguards which, if violated, may pre-\n   vent a child from receiving a FAPE. Among the most important\n   procedural safeguards are those that protect the parents’ right to\n   be involved in the development of their child’s educational plan.\n   Parents not only represent the best interests of their child in the\n   IEP development process, they also provide information about\n   the child critical to developing a comprehensive IEP and which\n   only they are in a position to know. To guarantee parents the abil-\n   ity to make informed decisions about their child’s education, the\n   IDEA grants them the right to “examine all relevant records”\n   relating to their child’s “identification, evaluation, and educa-\n   tional placement,” as well as “to obtain an independent educa-\n   tional evaluation” of their child if they disagree with what the\n   school district or state agency has found. 20 U.S.C.\n   § 1415(b)(1)(A). “[P]arents have the right to ‘present complaints\n   with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evalua-\n   tion, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of [a\n   FAPE] to such child.’ ” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1)(E). After making\n   their complaint, the parents are entitled to “an impartial due pro-\n   cess hearing . . . conducted by the State educational agency or by\n   the local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit,\n   as determined by State law or by the State educational agency,”\n   20 U.S.C. § 1415 (b)(2), and if either party is dissatisfied with the\n   state educational agency’s review, they may bring a civil action\n   in state or federal court, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(2).\nAmanda J., 267 F.3d at 882 (footnote omitted).\n\f16714           JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthe individualized educational program developed through the\nAct’s procedures was reasonably calculated to give the child\nappropriate educational benefits.5 Id. at 206-07.\n\n   Compliance with IDEA procedures is “essential to ensuring\nthat every eligible child receives a FAPE, and those proce-\ndures which provide for meaningful parental participation are\nparticularly important.” Amanda J., 267 F.3d at 891. “When\nthe elaborate and highly specific procedural safeguards\nembodied in [IDEA] are contrasted with the general and\nsomewhat imprecise substantive admonitions contained in the\nAct, we think that the importance Congress attached to these\nprocedural safeguards cannot be gainsaid.” Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 205.\n\nA.     Remedies for the District’s Procedural Violation\n\n   [1] IDEA requires school districts to provide “[w]ritten\nprior notice to the parents of the child . . . whenever the local\neducation agency . . . (A) proposes to initiate or change; or\n(B) refuses to initiate or change, the identification, evaluation,\nor educational placement of the child, or the provision of a\nfree appropriate public education to the child.” 20 U.S.C.\n§1415(b)(3) (2000). The District did not provide Appellants\nwith this notice until August 15, 2003, but it should have pro-\nvided the notice on May 7, 2003.\n  5\n     We also noted that:\n      The IDEA provides states with federal funds to help educate chil-\n      dren with disabilities if they provide every qualified child with a\n      FAPE that meets the federal statutory requirements. Congress\n      enacted the IDEA “to assure that all children with disabilities\n      have available to them . . . a free appropriate public education\n      which emphasizes special education and related services\n      designed to meet their unique needs . . . .”\nAmanda J., 267 F.3d at 882 (footnote omitted) (quoting 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1400(c) (1994)).\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT         16715\n   [2] Both parties agree that the District committed a proce-\ndural violation when it did not inform Appellants of its\nimpending evaluations of the twins and that this violation\ndeprived the twins of a FAPE. Appellants argue, however,\nthat the remedy imposed by the district court was an abuse of\ndiscretion. Specifically, Appellants urge us to hold that they\nshould receive a full reimbursement for the Center’s evalua-\ntions of the twins and reimbursement for the Center’s services\nbetween June 23 and August 25, 2003.\n\n   Under IDEA, the district court has the power to grant\nappropriate relief in equity. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(B) (2000);\nSch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359,\n374 (1985). A district court reviews the conduct of both par-\nties in fashioning relief. W.G. v. Bd of Trs. of Target Range\nSch. Dist., 960 F.2d 1479, 1486 (9th Cir. 1992). We review\nthe district court’s equitable award for abuse of discretion.\nForest Grove Sch. Dist. No. 23 v. T.A., 523 F.3d 1078, 1084-\n85 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n1.   Reimbursement for the Center’s Evaluations\n\n   [3] Appellants argue that they were not legally obligated to\nshare the Center’s evaluations and that the reduction in their\naward unfairly punishes them. A school district has an inde-\npendent duty to evaluate children after notice that they may\nhave learning disabilities. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412 (a)(3),(7)(2000);\nid. § 1414; N.B. v. Hellgate Elem. Sch. Dist., 541 F.3d 1202,\n1209-10 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n   [4] Notwithstanding the parents’ conduct, the District was\nduty-bound to evaluate the twins. In Target Range, we con-\ncluded that even though the parents had agreed to secure the\nchild’s private school’s participation in an IEP meeting, the\nschool district had to ensure that the private school partici-\npated. Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484-85. Although we held\nthat the parents’ actions were relevant in determining relief,\nwe did not reduce their reimbursement. Id. at 1486. In another\n\f16716       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncase, the parents did not turn over a full doctor’s report about\ntheir child. Union Sch. Dist. v. Smith, 15 F.3d 1519, 1524 (9th\nCir. 1994). This also did not excuse the school district’s obli-\ngation to obtain evaluations for itself, and those parents were\nalso entitled to a full reimbursement. Id. at 1527.\n\n   [5] Appellants did not receive notice that the District would\nevaluate the twins. Shortly after they should have received\nnotice, they took their children to a private Center to evaluate\nthem. The conduct of the parents in seeking private evaluation\nwas reasonable when they were not told that the District\nwould conduct evaluations of their children. Even if Appel-\nlants had shared the Center’s results with the District, the Dis-\ntrict’s obligation to conduct its own evaluations remained.\nTarget Range, 960 F.2d at 1484-85; Union Sch., 15 F.3d at\n1524. Appellants’ refusal to share this information, therefore,\ndid not harm the District. It had to obtain its own evaluation.\nIt would be improper to reduce Appellants’ award when their\nconduct did not harm the District. See 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law\nof Remedies §2.4(2), at 96 (2d ed. 1993) (discussing reducing\nequitable awards for unclean hands and stating “the plaintiff’s\nremedy against the defendant should not be denied unless his\nmisconduct has actually harmed the defendant, or has at least\nput the defendant in substantial risk of harm from that mis-\nconduct”).\n\n   [6] Appellants’ refusal to share information that they had\nno obligation to share has no connection to the District’s vio-\nlation of IDEA’s notice provisions. Appellants did not abso-\nlutely refuse to share this information until October, long after\nthe District’s violation of its duty to give notice of planned\nevaluations had occurred. Because no causal connection exists\nbetween the parents’ refusal to share the information they\ngained from the Center and the District’s prior delay in pro-\nviding them notice, Appellants are entitled to a full reimburse-\nment. See id. at 95 (noting that “courts are agreed that the\nplaintiff’s improper conduct, whatever it is, must be related in\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT          16717\nsome substantial and significant way to the claim he now\nasserts” for the court to reduce equitable relief).\n\n   [7] We conclude that the district court abused its discretion\nwhen it affirmed the award of only half of the costs of the\ntwins’ evaluations. Appellants are entitled to $1,670.00, the\nfull reimbursement for the twins’ evaluations.\n\n2.   Reimbursement for the Center’s Services\n\n   Although in some cases we have reviewed the question of\nreimbursement de novo, we have recognized that this was not\nin keeping with the text of the statute nor the dictates of\nSupreme Court precedent. Forest Grove, 523 F.3d at 1084-85.\nThus, we review the denial of reimbursement for abuse of dis-\ncretion.\n\n   Appellants contend that the district court abused its discre-\ntion when it did not grant equitable relief for the loss of ser-\nvices. The district court concluded that no relief was\nappropriate because the twins were not entitled to services\nduring that time. Appellants argue that they paid for services\nduring this time because they did not know that the District\nwould provide services; that the twins needed the services;\nand that the twins should have been eligible for services after\nJune 23, but the District had unreasonably delayed the evalua-\ntions.\n\n   The District violated IDEA when it did not provide Appel-\nlants notice of the procedural safeguards of IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(3) (2000). Those safeguards, however, only notify\nthe parents about a pending evaluation. The District must pro-\nvide services only upon a determination of eligibility. Id.\n§§ 1414, 1415(j). It would be incongruous to compensate\nAppellants for services before the District had determined the\ntwins were eligible for them.\n\n  Appellants also argue the twins needed services. The twins’\nneeds, however, have no bearing on the procedural violation\n\f16718          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthat occurred on May 7, 2003. Further, had the Appellants\nreceived notice of IDEA procedures, they would have learned\nthat the District had no obligation to provide services until\nafter the twins’ evaluations. This would likely have led\nAppellants to obtain services on their own.\n\n   The State Review Officer found and the District Court\naffirmed that the August 25, 2003, evaluations were timely\nunder IDEA. Appellants argue that the evaluation delay was\nunreasonable.6 The District argues that it complied with the\nstate administrative rule, a forty-five-school-day timeline for\nevaluating children. Nev. Admin. Code § 388.377(1)(A). We\nconsider what deference, if any, must be given by us to the\nNevada regulation based on the fact that the Secretary of Edu-\ncation approved it when determining to disburse IDEA funds.\nWe also consider whether, regardless of the Nevada regula-\ntion, the District’s actions in this instance were reasonable.\n\na.       The Nevada Statute and IDEA\n\n   [8] IDEA “leaves to the States the primary responsibility\nfor developing and executing educational programs for handi-\ncapped children, [but] it imposes significant requirements to\nbe followed in the discharge of that responsibility.” Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 183. It requires that a school district conduct an\nevaluation in a reasonable time. Assistance to States for Edu-\ncation of Children With Disabilities and the Early Interven-\ntion Program for Infants and Toddlers with Disabilities, 64\nFed. Reg. 12406, 12440 (Mar. 12, 1999) (implementing 34\n     6\n    It may be argued that this issue was not raised because it was not made\nexplicit in Appellants’ opening brief and it should be deemed waived. Rat-\ntlesnake Coal. v. U.S. Envt. Prot. Agency, 509 F.3d 1095, 1100 (9th Cir.\n2007). However, we think a fair reading of the opening brief implicitly\nraises this issue and the Center’s brief argued that its evaluations were\ntimely, and so we do not hold this argument waived. See Alcaraz v. INS,\n384 F.3d 1150, 1161 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that an exception to the\nwaiver rule exists when the failure to properly raise the issue caused no\nprejudice to the opposing party).\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16719\nC.F.R. § 300.343). But it allows states to establish their own\nprocedures. The Act ensures compliance by conditioning\nfunds on the Secretary of Education approving those proce-\ndures. 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a) (2000).\n\n   [9] Although the text of the statute is silent on evaluation\ntimeliness, the Secretary of Education has promulgated regu-\nlations that impose a “reasonable time” requirement. See id.\n§1414(a) (2000); 34 C.F.R. § 300.343 (1999). Specifically, in\n1999 the Secretary implemented a regulation that stated:\n“Each public agency shall ensure that within a reasonable\nperiod of time following the agency’s receipt of parent con-\nsent to an initial evaluation of a child- (i) The child is evalu-\nated . . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 300.343 (1999). We have also required\na timely evaluation in all areas of suspected disabilities. See\nHellgate Elem. Sch. Dist, 541 F.3d at 1209-10 (concluding\nthat a district that did not obtain an evaluation for autism for\nsix months denied the child a FAPE).\n\n   Department of Education letters interpreting and explaining\nIDEA have also emphasized the need for an initial evaluation\nto occur within a reasonable time. The Office of Special Edu-\ncation Programs, the principal office for administering IDEA,\nhas stated that an initial evaluation must be conducted “with-\nout undue delay.” Letter from Thomas Hehir, Dir., Office of\nSpecial Educ. Programs, to Jerry Saperstone, Mental Health\nServices System, 21 IDELR 1127 (OSEP 1994); see also 20\nU.S.C. § 1402 (2000). That Office also noted that the determi-\nnation of whether a school district did not conduct a timely\nevaluation according to IDEA and applicable state standards\nmust be made on a case-by-case basis. Letter from Stephanie\nSmith Lee, Dir., Office of Special Educ. Programs, to Beth\nDavis-Wellington, Children’s Advocacy Network (Aug. 19,\n2003) available at http://www.ed.gov/policy/speced/guid/\nidea/letters/2003-3/davis081903fape3q2003.pdf.\n\n  [10] In 1999, the Department of Education declined to\nimpose a specific timeline, stating that doing so “could result\n\f16720         JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nin the timelines being implemented only in a compliance\nsense, without regard to meeting the spirit of the requirement\n. . . . Although no specific timeline is given, implementation\nshould be done with all due haste.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 12581.\nThe Secretary’s refusal to adopt a specific timeline also sup-\nports the conclusion that the reasonableness of a child’s eval-\nuation depends on the individual circumstances.7\n\n   The Secretary of Education’s determination that a state’s\nprocedures comply with IDEA is entitled to some level of defer-\nence.8 See Lukhard v. Reed, 481 U.S. 368, 381 (1987) (noting\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services was entitled to\nsubstantial deference in his conclusion that a state’s regulation\nthat included personal injury awards in determining a family’s\n“income and resources” was consistent with HHS regulations\nthat were silent on that issue). The Secretary’s finding that\nNevada’s regulations comply with IDEA requirements “cons-\ntitute[s] a body of experience and informed judgment to\nwhich [we] may properly resort for guidance.” See Skidmore\n  7\n     A year after the events in this case occurred, Congress amended the\nAct to allow for more state discretion in imposing timelines for an evalua-\ntion. The 2004 amendments to the Act require evaluations to occur “within\n60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or, if the State\nestablishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be concluded,\nwithin such timeframe.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) (Supp. V 2005).\nIn promulgating regulations to implement this part of the statute, the\nDepartment of Education explicitly declined to state that sixty days was\nthe maximum timeframe. Instead, it stated the Act was intended “to permit\nStates to make reasoned determinations of the appropriate period of time\nin which evaluations should be conducted based on particular State cir-\ncumstances.” Assistance to the States for Education of Children with Dis-\nabilities and Preschool Grants for Children with Disabilities, 71 Fed. Reg.\n46540, 46637 (Aug. 14, 2006). We do not reach issues relating to the\ninterpretation of the statute as amended.\n   8\n     Although a state agency’s interpretation of federal law is not entitled\nto deference, Orthopaedic Hosp. v. Belshe, 103 F.3d 1491, 1495 (9th Cir.\n1997), the Secretary’s approval of that agency’s interpretation is due some\ndeference because it shows a federal agency’s interpretation of the federal\nstatute that it is charged to administer.\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                 16721\nv. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944). While we recognize\nthe Secretary has this experience and judgment, we do not\nhave the benefit of a written interpretation or formal opinion.\nMoreover, when the Secretary approved the Nevada regula-\ntion generally as a condition to the state receiving federal\nfunds, he did not indicate that he determined that the time\nlimit was reasonable in each case. As such, we do not give the\nSecretary’s judgment much weight.\n\n   [11] We hold that Nevada’s forty-five-school-day timeline\nis not an inconsistent interpretation of IDEA’s reasonable\ntimeliness requirement. We do not hold, however, that it pro-\nvides school districts with a safe-harbor under the applicable\nstatute. Regardless of compliance with a state regulatory\nrequirement, IDEA requires that districts act within a reason-\nable time to evaluate potentially disabled children. To be sure,\na failure to comply with the state’s regulation is good evi-\ndence of unreasonable delay.9 But compliance with the regu-\nlation will not necessarily mean that in each case the school\ndistrict completed its investigation in a reasonable period. We\nare impressed that the purposes of the IDEA will be best ful-\nfilled when school districts act as expeditiously as is practi-\ncally possible to complete the evaluations of disabled\nchildren.\n\n   IDEA requires courts to consider each child’s case individ-\nually. See generally Rowley, 458 U.S. 176. To allow a state\nto use its regulations as a safe harbor in the absence of a con-\ngressional directive or regulation allowing for such would\nflout Congress’s intent that judicial review of IDEA claims be\nchild-specific. Compliance with the state regulation is rele-\nvant and should be considered, but the ultimate and disposi-\ntive question is whether the District acted in a reasonable\ntime.\n  9\n   Indeed, a violation of the state regulation would be actionable. Target\nRange, 960 F.2d at 1483 (“State standards that are not inconsistent with\nfederal standards [under IDEA] are also enforceable in federal court.”).\n\f16722       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nb.   The Reasonableness of the Evaluation Timeframe\n\n  The District was required to give Appellants notice and a\nconsent form on May 7, 2003. From that date until August 25,\n2003, when the twins began receiving services, is 110 calen-\ndar days and thirty-eight school days.\n\n   [12] The 110-day delay was reasonable in this case. Noth-\ning occurred at the June 20 Child Find Day that indicated the\nDistrict should expedite the evaluations. The earliest the Dis-\ntrict had any notice of suspected autism was July 28, 2003.\nThe District began evaluating the twins one month later and\nbegan administering tests for autism one month after that. The\nHearing Officer credited testimony that stated this one-month\ndelay was essential to produce valid test results. Premature\ntesting without requisite trust and comfort level between child\nand evaluator would be ineffective. Based on the testimony\nthat the Hearing Officer considered credible, the delay was\nnot unreasonable.\n\n   [13] Small administrative delays, like this one, and espe-\ncially delays needed to promote effective test results, should\nnot render the District’s actions unreasonable. It also makes\nsense to allow school districts a degree of leeway during sum-\nmer vacation. See Doe v. Metro. Nashville Pub. Schs., 9 F.\nApp’x. 453 (6th Cir. 2001) (upholding a six-month delay\nwhere the child was out of state, it occurred over the holidays,\nand it was difficult for the school to obtain requested informa-\ntion).\n\n   Our holding does not encompass a situation where a school\ndistrict simply delays in the face of a referral for a potentially\nautistic child solely because summer vacation makes a timely\nevaluation difficult. In Adams v. Oregon, the school district\nreduced a child’s services to accommodate district staff’s\nsummer vacation plans. 195 F.3d 1141, 1144 (9th Cir. 1999).\nThe reduction had no bearing on the child’s unique needs and\ntherefore deprived the child of a FAPE. Id. at 1150-51. The\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT          16723\nschool district in Adams knew that the child had an urgent\nneed for services. Id. In our case, the District did not have\nknowledge or even notice of the twins’ autism until about two\nweeks before the scheduled assessments.\n\n   In Hellgate, the district learned a student was potentially\nautistic in August, referred him to another institution for an\nautism evaluation in November, and then did not obtain the\nevaluation until March. N.B. v. Hellgate Elementary Sch. Dist.\n541 F.3d at 1205-06. We concluded that this resulted in a\ndenial of a FAPE. Id. at 1208. Here, the District completed\nthe twins’ evaluations within three months of receiving notice\nthat the children potentially suffered from autism.\n\n   We give “due weight” to the administrative proceedings.\nVan Duyn, 502 F.3d at 817. The State Review Officer care-\nfully considered the record and found the District evaluated\nthe twins in a reasonable timeframe. Specifically, the State\nReview Officer found the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that\nextended school year days should be included in the forty-\nfive-school-day timeline was error. Without including those\ndays, the District had complied with the timeline. He further\nfound that the District had evaluated the twins in a reasonable\ntime. He noted that this was not a case, like Adams, where the\nDistrict had reduced services solely for its own convenience.\nRather, the State Review Officer concluded that the District\nneeded to coordinate its obligations to many children over the\nsummer while also meeting the forty-five-school-day time-\nline. Relying on the Hearing Officer’s finding that the District\nstaff had no reasonable basis to suspect the twins were autistic\non June 20, 2003, he concluded that the August 15, 2003\nassessment date was reasonable. Having considered the record\nand the arguments presented by the parties as well as the\napplicable law, we will not disturb the State Review Officer’s\nfinding.\n\n  [14] We hold that the district court abused its discretion in\nreducing the reimbursement of evaluation costs. The district\n\f16724       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in declining to award costs\nfor services that the twins received between June 23 and\nAugust 24, 2003.\n\nB.   The August 2003 IEPs\n\n1.   Alleged Procedural Violation\n\n   Appellants argue that the District did not comply with pro-\ncedures set forth in the Act in conducting the August 25,\n2003, evaluations. Specifically, Appellants urge us to con-\nclude that the District did not conduct a proper evaluation\nbecause it did not test the twins for autism before it finalized\nthe August 2003, IEPs. Appellants further assert that even if\nthe District did comply with IDEA procedures in conducting\nthe evaluations, the developed IEPs were not reasonably cal-\nculated to benefit the twins.\n\n    The district court found that the August 25, 2003, evalua-\ntions were “full and individual initial evaluations,” as required\nby IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(A) (2000). IDEA requires\nthat a school district use “a variety of assessment tools and\nstrategies . . . [and] use technically sound instruments.” Id.\n§ 1414(a)(2)(A),(C). Any standardized tests must “have been\nvalidated for the specific purpose for which they are used; . . .\nadministered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and\n. . . administered in accordance with any instructions provided\nby the producer of such tests.” Id. § 1414(b)(3). The evalua-\ntions must be “sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of\nthe child’s special education and related service needs,\nwhether or not commonly linked to the disability category in\nwhich the child has been classified.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.532(2)(h) (1999).\n\n   Appellants argue that the District did not fulfill these\nrequirements and that the District did not evaluate the twins\nwithin the meaning of IDEA. Appellants contend that the Dis-\ntrict should have assessed the twins using Wechsler’s Pre-\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT         16725\nschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence, the Childhood\nAutism Rating Scale, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary\nTests. The District used these tests in October.\n\n   The District responds that administering these tests in\nAugust would have violated IDEA’s requirement that it\nadminister the assessments in the manner most likely to yield\naccurate information. Id. These tests would not yield valid\nresults until the twins had become familiar with the District\nstaff, particularly in light of the twins’ unwillingness to\nrespond to the staff’s questions.\n\n   The District administered several tests before the August\n25, 2003, IEP meeting: the twins’ mother completed a ques-\ntionnaire on May 5, 2003; a District staff member gave\nAssessments of Phonological Process on June 20, 2003; and\nthe District administered AGS Early Screening Profile Home/\nHealth Questionnaires providing information about parent/\nchild interactions and the twins’ health.\n\n   The Hearing Officer, State Review Officer, and district\ncourt all found the August evaluations were evaluations\nwithin the meaning of IDEA, crediting the District’s staff tes-\ntimony about the dubious reliability of tests administered too\nearly. While the Center administered some autism tests quite\nearly, the Discrete Trial Teacher did not even begin evaluat-\ning the twins until one month after she began observing\nthem—month after they began attending the Center, lending\nfurther credence to the District’s contentions. Some of the\nstaff at the Center did not believe the twins were autistic as\nlate as August 15, 2003. Thus, although the Center had stated\nits suspicions as early as July 28, 2003, its results then were\nnot definitive.\n\n  [15] The Hearing Officer’s findings were “thorough and\ncareful” and are thus due greater deference. See Napa Valley\nUnified Sch. Dist., 496 F.3d at 937 (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). The Hearing Officer found the District\n\f16726       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nPsychologist’s testimony credible and she noted that some of\nthe mandatory tests for autism require observation of the child\nfor over a month. Giving the Hearing Officer due deference,\nwe agree that the District could not effectively administer the\nautism tests until after the test administrators had gotten to\nknow the twins. Because the District could not immediately\nadminister the tests for autism in a valid manner, as required\nby IDEA, the August evaluations qualify as initial evaluations\nunder IDEA. 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.531, 300.532 (1999).\n\n   In Hellgate, we determined that the IEP team could not\ndevelop a plan reasonably calculated to provide the child with\na meaningful educational benefit for the school year without\nan autism evaluation. Hellgate Elem. Sch. Dist., 541 F.3d at\n1209-10. The district in Hellgate received notice that the child\ncould be autistic in August but did not obtain an evaluation\nand convene an IEP meeting to address the child’s autism\nuntil March. See id. at 1205-06. By contrast, the District here\nconvened IEP meetings to address the twins’ autism within\ntwo months of finalizing the original IEPs. The District had\ntaken the time necessary to conduct proper and valid assess-\nments and then had begun addressing what additional services\nthe twins needed.\n\n   Because we hold that the August evaluations qualify as ini-\ntial evaluations under IDEA, we reject the contention that\nthere was at the outset a lack of evaluations resulting in the\ndenial of a FAPE.\n\n2.   Alleged Substantive Violation\n\n   Appellants also argue that the August IEPs were not rea-\nsonably calculated to provide the twins with educational bene-\nfits because the IEPs did not address the twins’ autism. We\nconsider the IEP at the time of its implementation, not in\nhindsight, and ask if its methods were reasonably calculated\nto confer an educational benefit on the child. Adams, 195 F.3d\nat 1149.\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                   16727\n   The twins received ninety minutes of speech and language\nservices twice a week, and the Special Education Teacher\nindividualized the twins’ services in the TEDDY program by\nrelying on index cards. These services gave the twins educa-\ntional benefits. Importantly, the District was pursuing autism\neligibility determinations. The District, however, reasonably\ncalculated that the August IEPs could confer educational ben-\nefits on the twins based on the tests that the District could val-\nidly administer in August. Further, the twins made progress in\ncertain areas while they attended the TEDDY program. Their\nIEPs that were developed after the autism determination con-\ntinued their placement in the TEDDY program.\n\n  Finally, Appellants also argue that the twins’ August IEPs\nwere not individually tailored.10 IDEA requires IEPs be indi-\nvidual tailored to the unique needs of each child. Amanda J.,\n267 F.3d at 894. The August 15, 2003, assessments only\nshowed one difference between the twins regarding motor\nskills. Because this was the only distinction between the twins\nin the tests that the District could validly administer in\nAugust, the lack of individualization is not surprising. The\nDistrict planned more tests as soon as it could effectively\nadminister them.\n\n  [16] We hold that the District provided the children with a\nFAPE from August 25 until October 21 and November 4,\n2003.\n  10\n    Appellants also suggest that it was impermissible that the District\nbegan the August IEP meeting with identical pre-written IEPs. This does\nnot invalidate the substance or development of the IEPs. 64 Fed. Reg. at\n12478-79. Appellants put forth no evidence that the District presented the\nIEPs in a “take it or leave it” position, which would have constituted error.\nSee Ms. S. ex rel. G., v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist., 337 F.3d 1115, 1131\n(9th Cir. 2003).\n\f16728         JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nC.     The October and November IEPs.\n\n   Appellants also raise a substantive challenge to the October\nand November IEPs. They contend that the District could not\nimplement the October and November IEPs and that these\nIEPs were not reasonably calculated to confer an educational\nbenefit. Specifically, Appellants argue that the District had no\nbehavior analyst on staff. A behavior analyst would be quali-\nfied to perform functional analysis and supervise the staff in\nthe implementation of a discrete trial training program. The\nDistrict responds that IDEA does not require a district to\nemploy a behavior analyst. Rather, it requires the District to\nemploy an individual with Nevada State Education Agency-\nrecognized certification, licensing, or registration. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.23.\n\n   The Hearing Officer’s detailed findings of fact, adopted by\nthe State Review Officer and affirmed by the district court,\ndemonstrate that the District did have personnel capable of\nimplementing the IEPs. The District had contracted with two\nprivate behavior analysts for support in implementing the dis-\ncrete trial training program.11 Trained personnel from the Uni-\nversity of Nevada would perform functional behavior analysis\nat the twins’ home and school.\n\n   The District Special Education Teacher had been concerned\nabout her abilities to implement the IEPs in early October.\nAfter she learned the District would provide her with addi-\ntional training, she stated that she felt confident that she could\nimplement the IEPs. Although the parents preferred that the\n  11\n     Appellants also argue that the independent contractor would use the\ntwins as guinea pigs for training. A District staff member testified that the\nbehavior analysts would “train our staff members using [JG] and examples\nwith him, but that since they were not going to be there 15 hours a week\ntheir function was to build capacity amongst our people.” The testimony\nsuggests that the behavior analysts would deliver some discrete trials to\nthe twins as examples to help train the teachers. It does not suggest that\nthey would have an untrained teacher deliver discrete trials.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16729\nDistrict hire the Center’s discrete trial training instructor, we\nfocus on the District’s proposed implementation plan, not the\nparents’ preferred alternative. See Gregory K. v. Longview\nSch. Dist., 811 F.2d 1307, 1314 (9th Cir. 1987).\n\n   The District must implement an IEP as soon as possible,\nbut the District has a reasonable amount of time to do so, par-\nticularly where the circumstances require a short delay. 64\nFed. Reg. 12440 & 12579 (March 12, 1999) (implementing\n34 C.F.R. § 300.342 and comments). The evidence shows that\nthe District would have had qualified staff within a reasonable\namount of time, but the parents did not allow the District to\nprovide services.\n\n  [17] We hold that the District had adequate resources to\nimplement the October and November IEPs.\n\nD.   The Rehabilitation Act claim\n\n   For the first time in district court, Appellants added a Claim\nof discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Appellees\nargued that this claim was improperly presented because it\nwas unexhausted. They also argued that the claim should lose\non its merits. The District first made the exhaustion argument\nin its reply brief to its summary judgment motion. The Dis-\ntrict had assumed the Rehabilitation Act claim was a claim for\na denial of a FAPE, not an unexhausted claim that the District\nhad discriminated against the twins by segregating them.\nAppellants argue that the district court erred in granting the\nDistrict’s summary judgment motion and denying their cross-\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n  The grant or denial of summary judgment is a conclusion\nof law, reviewed de novo. See Amanda J., 267 F.3d at 887.\n\n   IDEA is not an exclusive remedy for children with disabili-\nties who complain of failures in their education. See Mark H.,\n513 F.3d at 925 (concluding that the availability of relief\n\f16730          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nunder IDEA does not limit the availability of relief under the\nRehabilitation Act). Nevertheless, IDEA requires that when a\nplaintiff files an action that seeks relief under another statute,\nand that relief is also available under IDEA, he or she must\nfollow IDEA exhaustion procedures. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)\n(2000); Robb v. Bethel Sch. Dist. #403, 308 F.3d 1047, 1050\n(9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   Appellants went through the administrative process but did\nnot argue that the District discriminated against the twins by\nsegregating them. Appellants argue that their lack of exhaus-\ntion is not fatal to their claim because their segregation claim\ncould not be heard in an IDEA due process hearing. Neverthe-\nless, § 1415(b)(6) allows claims “with respect to any matter\nrelating to the identification, evaluation, or educational place-\nment of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public\neducation” to be heard. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6) (emphasis\nadded). Further, the parents in Mark H. presented their Reha-\nbilitation Act claim during the administrative process, even\nthough the hearing officer did not rule on the issue. Appel-\nlants also could have argued their discrimination claim in the\nhearing. Mark H., 513 F.3d at 927 n.3.12\n  12\n      The partial dissent argues that because all of the “educational issues”\nwere exhausted, we should conclude that Appellants adequately exhausted\ntheir Rehabilitation Act claim. There are two primary problems with the\npartial dissent’s analysis: First, in Blanchard v. Morton v. School Disrict,\n420 F.3d 918, 920-21 (9th Cir. 2005), we stated that “[t]he dispositive\nquestion . . . is whether Blanchard is seeking remedy for injuries that could\nbe redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administrative procedures.” Id.\nat 921. As we see it, the ALJ could have ordered the District to place the\ntwins in regular preschool programing, remedying Appellants’ alleged\ninjury to some degree. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(3)(B)(ii). Therefore, even\nunder Blanchard, exhaustion was required. Second, in Witte and Blan-\nchard, the parties had resolved “educational issues” to mutual satisfaction,\nand none of their injuries could have been redressed by recourse to the\nIDEA exhaustion process. We see a different case where the parties are\nstill litigating their educational issues and the administrative process might\nhave been used in attempt to gain a remedy for their alleged injury.\n\f               JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                    16731\n   Appellants argue that the District has waived its exhaustion\ndefense. There is some question regarding whether IDEA’s\nexhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, or whether a district\ncould waive this argument. See Coleman v. Newburgh\nEnlarged City Sch. Dist., 503 F.3d 198, 204 (2d Cir. 2007)\n(discussing recent Supreme Court precedent casting doubt on\nthis issue). The exhaustion requirement reflects “ ‘the tradi-\ntionally strong state and local interest in education.’ ” Christo-\npher S. v. Stanislaus County Office of Educ., 384 F.3d 1205,\n1209 (9th Cir. 2004) (quoting Hoeft v. Tucson Unified Sch.\nDist., 967 F.2d 1298, 1303 (9th Cir. 1992)). We need not\naddress whether exhaustion under IDEA is a non-\njurisdictional claims-processing rule, or a jurisdictional bar.\nSee Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 16 (2005) (per\ncuriam). The District did not forfeit the argument. The Dis-\ntrict raised it as soon as the nature of Appellants’ Rehabilita-\ntion Act claim became clear. Once the District learned that the\nclaim was not arguing that the District had denied Appellants\na FAPE, they moved to amend their answer and asserted the\nexhaustion defense. The District’s treatment of this exhaus-\ntion issue in our view was timely.13\n\n   [18] Appellants did not properly present the claim to the\ndistrict court. The District had no notice that Appellants con-\nsidered the twins’ placement discriminatory. Therefore, we\nvacate the district court’s order granting the District summary\njudgment and hold that this claim should have been dismissed\nwithout prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.14\n  13\n      Even though the issue was not raised in the opposition brief, under our\nprecedent we can consider the issue because it was raised explicitly in the\nAppellant’s brief. See USA Petroleum Co. v. Atl. Richfield Co., 13 F.3d\n1276, 1278 (9th Cir. 1994) (considering an issue that appellant did not\nraise in opening brief after appellee throughly discussed it).\n   14\n      Finally, Appellants argue that the district court abused its discretion\nin denying their motion to strike the District’s reply brief or in the alterna-\ntive grant them leave to file a sur-reply. In its reply brief to its motion for\nsummary judgment, the District argued that the Appellants had not\n\f16732         JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   [19] For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district\ncourt’s decision reducing the reimbursement for evaluations,\nwe AFFIRM the district court’s decision on all other IDEA\nclaims and on the motion to strike, we VACATE the district\ncourt’s opinion on Appellant’s Rehabilitation Act claims, and\nwe REMAND WITH INSTRUCTIONS that the district court\nDISMISS that claim without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\nEach party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n  AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART;\nVACATED IN PART AND REMANDED WITH\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n   I concur in the court’s disposition of Appellants’ claims\nunder the IDEA. However, because I do not think the IDEA’s\nexhaustion requirements bar the plaintiffs from pursuing their\nclaims under § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, I respectfully\ndissent from the court’s holding the district court lacked juris-\ndiction to hear these claims. I would instead affirm the district\ncourt’s order granting summary judgment in favor of the\nAppellee.\n\nexhausted the Rehabilitation Act claim and submitted new evidence. We\nreview a district court’s decision on a motion to strike for abuse of discre-\ntion. Golden Gate Hotel Ass’n v. City & County of S.F., 18 F.3d 1482,\n1485 (9th Cir. 1994). Where “ ‘new evidence is presented in a reply to a\nmotion for summary judgment, the district court should not consider the\nnew evidence without giving the [non-]movant an opportunity to\nrespond.’ ” Provenz v. Miller, 102 F.3d 1478, 1483 (9th Cir. 1996) (quot-\ning Black v. TIC Inv. Corp., 900 F.2d 112, 116 (7th Cir. 1990) (alteration\nin original). The district court did not consider the new evidence and its\ndenial of leave to file a sur-reply accordingly did not prejudice Appellants.\nWe hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\nAppellants’ motion to strike.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16733\n   In the district court, the Appellants contended for the first\ntime that the District’s placement of the twins in the TEDDY\nprogram constituted intentional discrimination under the\nRehabilitation Act. The Appellants contended the District,\nrather than making an individualized determination regarding\nthe twins’ needs, simply labeled the twins “disabled,” and\nassigned the twins to special education. This, the Appellants\nclaimed, constituted “segregation.” The Appellants sought\nmonetary damages, a form of relief unavailable under the\nIDEA. See Witte v. Clark County Sch. Dist., 197 F.3d 1271,\n1275 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n   The IDEA requires a plaintiff to exhaust administrative\nremedies before filing suit under another statute if the plaintiff\nis “seeking relief that is also available under” the IDEA. 20\nU.S.C. § 1415(l). Though Appellants seek some relief not\navailable under IDEA, they were nevertheless required to pur-\nsue those remedies that were available to them in state admin-\nistrative proceedings; their claims could have been redressed,\nto an extent, by remedies available under the IDEA. See Robb\nv. Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403, 308 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.\n2002).\n\n   But here, unlike Robb, Appellants are not attempting to\n“opt out” of the IDEA altogether. Id. Appellants have pursued\nor are pursuing all those remedies available to them under the\nIDEA. And, in the state administrative proceeding, Appellants\ncontended the District assigned the twins to the TEDDY pro-\ngram without undertaking the individualized evaluation\nrequired by law. The plaintiffs in Robb, by contrast, failed to\nfile any administrative claim whatsoever. See id.\n\n   In two cases, we permitted a plaintiff who first seeks\nadministrative relief in state IDEA proceedings to file a sepa-\nrate suit for damages under § 1983 or the Rehabilitation Act.\nIn Witte, the plaintiffs sought monetary damages under\n§ 1983, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act for emotional and physical abuse by school\n\f16734       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nemployees. 197 F.3d at 1276. In Blanchard v. Morton School\nDistrict, the mother of a disabled child sought money dam-\nages under § 1983 for emotional distress and lost wages\ncaused by the school district’s “deliberate indifference” to her\nson’s IDEA claims. 420 F.3d 918, 919 (9th Cir. 2005). In both\nWitte and Blanchard, we held that the plaintiffs were not\nrequired to advance the claim for damages in state IDEA pro-\nceedings, provided the plaintiff had raised all of the “educa-\ntional issues” implicated by the child’s disability in the IDEA\nproceeding. Id. at 921-22; Witte, 197 F.3d at 1275.\n\n   In short, Witte and Blanchard stand for the principle that\nonce a plaintiff has raised all of the “educational issues” asso-\nciated with an IDEA claim in a state administrative proceed-\ning, nothing prevents him from asserting a claim for damages\nin district court alleging a defendant school district also vio-\nlated other statutory provisions. Such an approach fulfills the\npurposes of exhaustion—providing courts with expert assis-\ntance and offering state officials the first opportunity to cor-\nrect an educational deficiency, see Robb, 308 F.3d at 1051—\nwithout forcing plaintiffs to engage in the futile gesture of\nraising damages claims in state administrative proceedings,\nwhere the agency lacks the power to award such relief.\n\n   Here, Appellants have resolved all of the “educational\nissues” associated with their claims. Appellants contended in\nstate administrative proceedings that the District’s evaluation\nof the twins was deficient and that the twins’ assignment to\nthe TEDDY program did not meet the twins’ educational\nneeds. The only new issue raised by Appellants’ Rehabilita-\ntion Act claim is an allegation that the District acted with dis-\ncriminatory intent. In the IDEA proceedings, the intent with\nwhich a district acts in failing to provide a FAPE is irrelevant;\nonly the result of its actions or inactions matter. Nor is the\nDistrict’s intent an “educational issue” the resolution of which\nrequires the expert guidance of a state administrator. Cf.\nKutasi v. Las Virgines Unified Sch. Dist., 494 F.3d 1162,\n1169 (9th Cir. 2007).\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16735\n   I would instead affirm the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment in favor of the Appellee. Where a district\nassigns a student to special education pursuant to a valid IEP,\nthe district is not liable for intentional discrimination under\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Mark H. v. Lemahiu, 513\nF.3d 922, 934 (9th Cir. 2008). Because I agree that the Dis-\ntrict provided the twins valid IEPs, I would affirm the district\ncourt’s decision on the merits, rather than conclude the district\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over Appellants’ Rehabilitation Act\nclaims.\n\f",

The controversy arises out of the school district’s\ndelay in notifying the twins’ parents that it would evaluate the\ntwins for disabilities; from the amount of time it took the\nschool district to diagnose them with autism; from the chal-\nlenges that confronted the school district in its implementation\nof an Individualized Education Program (“IEP”) for each of\nthe children; and from the school district’s alleged discrimina-\ntion against the children by segregating them into a preschool\nfor developmentally delayed youngsters.\n\n   Appellants JG and NG are twin brothers who exhibited\ndelays in their speech patterns and other developmental diffi-\nculties. On May 3, 2003, their mother took them to a free\nscreening at the Brain Power Community Learning Center\n(“the Center”). The Center offers private services for children\n\f16706       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nwith disabilities. The Center referred the twins to the Douglas\nCounty School District (“the District”) and told their mother\nthat the District had a program for developmentally-delayed\nchildren called the TEDDY program.1\n\n   On May 5, 2003, the twins’ mother went to the District’s\nChild Find Office and received a two-page questionnaire for\neach child. She completed the questionnaires, and the Dis-\ntrict’s Child Find Office confirmed receipt of both question-\nnaires on May 7, 2003. The parties agree that IDEA required\nthe District to provide Appellants with notice of a proposal to\nevaluate the twins and a copy of IDEA’s procedural safe-\nguards on May 7, 2003. 20 U.S.C. § §1415(b)(3), (d)(1)(A)\n(2000). The District, however, did not notify the parents that\nit would conduct evaluations of the twins until August 15,\n2003. IDEA also required the District to evaluate the children\nwithin a reasonable time of the May 7 date. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.343(b) (1999). Although the District began administer-\ning tests to evaluate the twins as early as June 20, 2003, it did\nnot complete until August 15, 2003, any evaluation of the\nchildren. It did not begin to evaluate the twins for autism until\nSeptember 25, 2003.\n\n   The District referred the twins to its Child Find Day on\nJune 20, 2003. The twins’ mother asked if the twins could be\ntested earlier, but the District’s Special Education Teacher\nwho reviewed the twins’ initial forms did not have a high\nlevel of concern and did not advance the test date.\n\n   Without notice that the District would evaluate the twins,\nAppellants obtained private evaluations for the twins from the\nCenter. On May 14, 2003, the Center evaluated the twins, and\nthe twins began receiving special education services one week\nlater.\n  1\n    TEDDY stands for Teaching Early Developmentally Delayed Young-\nsters.\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                 16707\n   On June 20, 2003, the twins attended the District’s Child\nFind Day. Their mother listed “speech development” as her\nprimary concern and crying, tantrumming, and toileting as\nother behavioral issues. She also told the District’s Special\nEducation Teacher that both attended the Center for speech\nproblems. The Special Education Teacher and the School\nSpeech Pathologist each gave tests to the twins and received\na lack of responses. This lack of responses showed that the\ntwins were developmentally delayed, and the Special Educa-\ntion Teacher concluded that she could not conduct further\nscreening at that time. The Special Education Teacher sched-\nuled an assessment meeting on August 15, 2003, to conduct\nmore individualized testing. The Special Education Teacher\ninformally expressed that the District could use the scores\nfrom the tests the Center had administered, but she did not\nmake a specific request for the records.\n\n   Also in mid-June, the Center Discrete Trial Trainer,2 an\nindividual trained in working with autistic children, met the\ntwins. She observed them for several weeks at the Center and\nat home. The Center Discrete Trial Trainer started working\nwith the twins on July 15, 2003, but it took several more\nweeks before she could begin her assessment of either of them\nand another two weeks after that before she implemented dis-\ncrete trial training. Thus, although the Center had begun test-\ning the twins for autism in May, it was still assessing the\ntwins for autism in July.\n\n   By late July, some of the Center staff believed that the\ntwins were autistic. On July 28, 2003, the Director of the Cen-\nter contacted the District’s Special Education Director and\nrelayed the Center’s suspicions. The Director of the Center\nsaid that the Center Speech Pathologist, who had worked with\n  2\n    Discrete Trial Training is a commonly-used therapy for Autistic chil-\ndren: The teacher prompts the child, then the child responds with a behav-\nior and finally there is a consequence—some type of positive\nreinforcement.\n\f16708          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthe twins the longest, did not believe that the twins had\nautism. On the same day, the twins’ mother called the District\nto ask if the assessments could be scheduled earlier. The Dis-\ntrict did not change the test date.\n\n   On August 15, 2003, the District conducted an assessment\nof each twin and held an assessment meeting. At that time, the\ntwins’ parents received a copy of the Notice of Parent Rights,\nand their mother signed a “Parent Consent to Evaluate” form.\nThe parents and the Special Education Teacher also filled out\nEarly Childhood Screening Profiles for the twins. The District\nstaff worked with the twins for more than an hour but was\nunable to get responses from either of the twins on many\nquestions. The tests that the staff members were able to\nadminister supported the conclusion that the twins had “devel-\nopmental delays with speech delay as a major concern.”\n\n   Despite the July 28 phone call from the Center, the August\n15 assessments did not include any tests for autism. In fact,\nthe School Special Education Director had not relayed the\nCenter’s suspicions to the School Psychologist, who would\nhave administered any tests for autism. Determining whether\na student has autism requires many assessments and takes a\ngood deal of time. Some of the tests require observation of the\nstudent for more than a month because it is helpful to get to\nknow a child before assessing him or her.3\n\n   On August 25, 2003, the District held an IEP meeting with\nthe twins’ mother. At the meeting, the District presented her\nwith pre-written IEPs as draft copies, and the District found\nthe twins eligible for services under the developmentally\n  3\n    The Center administered the Child Autism Rating Scale autism test on\nthe first day of its evaluations, but the Center’s Discrete Trial Trainer took\nseveral weeks to complete the assessments. The record is unclear when the\nCenter concluded the twins had autism. But the July 28, 2003, conversa-\ntion with the District only relayed that the Center suspected the twins were\nautistic. Thus, the Center was not certain in its diagnosis more than two\nmonths after it began evaluating the children.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT            16709\ndelayed category and offered services. The IEPs did not men-\ntion autism.\n\n   The twins’ mother attended the August 25, 2003, meeting\nwith a binder labeled “Autism,” and the School Psychologist\nasked if there were concerns regarding the twins being autis-\ntic. The twins’ mother responded that the Center staff thought\nthat the twins could be autistic but that they were not sure.\n\n   On August 25, 2003, the twins began attending the Dis-\ntrict’s TEDDY program. They continued receiving services at\nthe Center to supplement the program.\n\n   On September 25, 2003, one month after the School Psy-\nchologist and two months after the Special Education Director\nhad heard about the possibility of autism, the School Psychol-\nogist began assessing the twins for autism. On October 1,\n2003, the parents sent the District a letter stating that the twins\nhad been evaluated as having autism and requesting payment\nfor Center services.\n\n   On October 7, 2003, the District asked the parents to sign\na Consent for Release of Information from the Center. They\nrefused. The twins’ mother agreed, however, to bring the Cen-\nter staff to a meeting on October 8, 2003. At that meeting, the\nCenter shared some data. The parents said that they would not\nprovide more information from the Center unless the District\npaid for it.\n\n   On October 9, 13, and 16, 2003, the School Psychologist\ncompleted several tests to determine whether the twins were\nautistic. She determined that both twins were mildly-\nmoderately autistic. The District began working on new IEPs\nto propose for the twins.\n\n  On October 9, 2003, the Special Education Teacher told the\nmother about her concern that she would not be able to imple-\nment the newly proposed IEP. She became comfortable with\n\f16710       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nher ability to implement the IEPs by early November, after\nlearning that the District would provide her with more train-\ning.\n\n   Both twins began exhibiting new inappropriate behaviors\nduring the week of October 9, 2003. These included choking\ntheir younger brother, stomping on books, and tearing up\nbooks. The twins, however, had improved since they enrolled\nin the TEDDY program, with a decreased resistance to toilet-\ning and an increased ability to follow directions and rules.\n\n   The parents removed the twins from the TEDDY program\non October 13, 2003, expressing concern about the new prob-\nlem behaviors. The parents again asked the District to pay for\nthe twins to attend the Center.\n\n   On October 17, 2003, the District held a meeting to update\nthe twins’ IEPs with the autism results. The District deter-\nmined that both twins were eligible as autistic: the District\nfound JG eligible at an October 21, 2003, meeting and NG\neligible at a November 4, 2003, meeting. The District pro-\nposed new IEPs that added time for discrete trial training,\nextended school year, and functional behavior analysis at the\ntwins’ home and school.\n\n   On October 30, 2003, the twins’ mother called the District\nand asked who would conduct the discrete trial trainings and\nwhere they would be held. The District Program Specialist\nresponded that it had contracted with two private behavior\nanalysts for support in implementing the discrete trial training\nprogram.\n\n   In early November 2003, the parents rejected the twins’\nIEPs. They wanted the Center Discrete Trial Teacher to con-\ntinue working with the twins. The District had considered hir-\ning her, but she did not have early childhood authorization.\nShe was also reluctant to work for the District except in a\nsupervisory role.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT          16711\n   On November 10, 2003, the Special Education Director\nwrote a letter to the parents in which she described the pro-\nposal for a Free Appropriate Public Education (“FAPE”),\nrefused to pay for the Center’s services, and stated that the\nDistrict would deliver the discrete trials in a one-on-one and\nsmall group basis.\n\n   The parents stopped sending the twins to the Center in mid-\nNovember because the parents could no longer pay for the\nservices. The parents chose to keep the twins at home, and the\ntwins did not receive any services.\n\n   On December 4, 2003, Appellants requested a due process\nhearing. The Hearing Officer held a hearing from February\n16-20, 2004. She found that the District had committed proce-\ndural violations by not evaluating the twins in a timely man-\nner. She concluded that Appellants should be compensated for\nservices between August 13 and August 25, awarding $800.00\nto compensate for those services.\n\n   The parties appealed, and on September 2, 2004, the State\nReview Officer adopted all of the Hearing Officer’s findings\nof fact but reversed her decision awarding the $800.00. The\nState Review Officer concluded, however, that the District\nhad denied the twins a FAPE when it did not provide Appel-\nlants with a notice of proposal to evaluate and notice of proce-\ndural safeguards on May 7. The State Review Officer ordered\nthe District to compensate Appellants fifty percent of the cost\nof obtaining the Center’s evaluations, a total of $835.\n\n   On September 28, 2004, Appellants appealed to the district\ncourt. They also alleged discrimination in violation of section\n504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The district court\naffirmed the State Review Officer’s decision, granted the Dis-\ntrict’s motion for summary judgment on the discrimination\nclaim, and denied Appellant’s cross-motion for summary\njudgment. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.\n\f16712      JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\n   On appeal, Appellants argue (1) that the district court\nabused its discretion in reducing their award by fifty percent\nfor equitable reasons and abused its discretion by not award-\ning them the costs of services; (2) that the August 2003 IEPs\nwere not adequate IEPs and did not provide the twins with a\nFAPE; (3) that JG’s October 2003 IEP and NG’s November\n2003 IEP did not provide the twins with a FAPE; and (4) that\nthe district court erred in granting the District’s motion for\nsummary judgment and denying Appellants’ motion for sum-\nmary judgment on the Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n                STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n   We review the district court’s findings of fact for clear\nerror, even when the district court based those findings on an\nadministrative record.

Among the most important\n   procedural safeguards are those that protect the parents’ right to\n   be involved in the development of their child’s educational plan.\n   Parents not only represent the best interests of their child in the\n   IEP development process, they also provide information about\n   the child critical to developing a comprehensive IEP and which\n   only they are in a position to know. To guarantee parents the abil-\n   ity to make informed decisions about their child’s education, the\n   IDEA grants them the right to “examine all relevant records”\n   relating to their child’s “identification, evaluation, and educa-\n   tional placement,” as well as “to obtain an independent educa-\n   tional evaluation” of their child if they disagree with what the\n   school district or state agency has found. 20 U.S.C.\n   § 1415(b)(1)(A). “[P]arents have the right to ‘present complaints\n   with respect to any matter relating to the identification, evalua-\n   tion, or educational placement of the child, or the provision of [a\n   FAPE] to such child.’ ” 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(1)(E). After making\n   their complaint, the parents are entitled to “an impartial due pro-\n   cess hearing . . . conducted by the State educational agency or by\n   the local educational agency or an intermediate educational unit,\n   as determined by State law or by the State educational agency,”\n   20 U.S.C. § 1415 (b)(2), and if either party is dissatisfied with the\n   state educational agency’s review, they may bring a civil action\n   in state or federal court, 20 U.S.C. § 1415(e)(2).\nAmanda J., 267 F.3d at 882 (footnote omitted).\n\f16714           JG v.

Reimbursement for the Center’s Evaluations\n\n   [3] Appellants argue that they were not legally obligated to\nshare the Center’s evaluations and that the reduction in their\naward unfairly punishes them. A school district has an inde-\npendent duty to evaluate children after notice that they may\nhave learning disabilities. 20 U.S.C. §§ 1412 (a)(3),(7)(2000);\nid. § 1414; N.B. v. Hellgate Elem. Sch.

In Target Range, we con-\ncluded that even though the parents had agreed to secure the\nchild’s private school’s participation in an IEP meeting, the\nschool district had to ensure that the private school partici-\npated. Target Range, 960 F.2d at 1484-85. Although we held\nthat the parents’ actions were relevant in determining relief,\nwe did not reduce their reimbursement. Id. at 1486. In another\n\f16716       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncase, the parents did not turn over a full doctor’s report about\ntheir child. Union Sch. Dist. v.

This also did not excuse the school district’s obli-\ngation to obtain evaluations for itself, and those parents were\nalso entitled to a full reimbursement. Id. at 1527.\n\n   [5] Appellants did not receive notice that the District would\nevaluate the twins. Shortly after they should have received\nnotice, they took their children to a private Center to evaluate\nthem. The conduct of the parents in seeking private evaluation\nwas reasonable when they were not told that the District\nwould conduct evaluations of their children. Even if Appel-\nlants had shared the Center’s results with the District, the Dis-\ntrict’s obligation to conduct its own evaluations remained.\nTarget Range, 960 F.2d at 1484-85; Union Sch., 15 F.3d at\n1524. Appellants’ refusal to share this information, therefore,\ndid not harm the District. It had to obtain its own evaluation.\nIt would be improper to reduce Appellants’ award when their\nconduct did not harm the District. See 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law\nof Remedies §2.4(2), at 96 (2d ed. 1993) (discussing reducing\nequitable awards for unclean hands and stating “the plaintiff’s\nremedy against the defendant should not be denied unless his\nmisconduct has actually harmed the defendant, or has at least\nput the defendant in substantial risk of harm from that mis-\nconduct”).\n\n   [6] Appellants’ refusal to share information that they had\nno obligation to share has no connection to the District’s vio-\nlation of IDEA’s notice provisions. Appellants did not abso-\nlutely refuse to share this information until October, long after\nthe District’s violation of its duty to give notice of planned\nevaluations had occurred. Because no causal connection exists\nbetween the parents’ refusal to share the information they\ngained from the Center and the District’s prior delay in pro-\nviding them notice, Appellants are entitled to a full reimburse-\nment. See id. at 95 (noting that “courts are agreed that the\nplaintiff’s improper conduct, whatever it is, must be related in\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT          16717\nsome substantial and significant way to the claim he now\nasserts” for the court to reduce equitable relief).\n\n   [7] We conclude that the district court abused its discretion\nwhen it affirmed the award of only half of the costs of the\ntwins’ evaluations. Appellants are entitled to $1,670.00, the\nfull reimbursement for the twins’ evaluations.\n\n2.   Reimbursement for the Center’s Services\n\n   Although in some cases we have reviewed the question of\nreimbursement de novo, we have recognized that this was not\nin keeping with the text of the statute nor the dictates of\nSupreme Court precedent. Forest Grove, 523 F.3d at 1084-85.\nThus, we review the denial of reimbursement for abuse of dis-\ncretion.\n\n   Appellants contend that the district court abused its discre-\ntion when it did not grant equitable relief for the loss of ser-\nvices. The district court concluded that no relief was\nappropriate because the twins were not entitled to services\nduring that time. Appellants argue that they paid for services\nduring this time because they did not know that the District\nwould provide services; that the twins needed the services;\nand that the twins should have been eligible for services after\nJune 23, but the District had unreasonably delayed the evalua-\ntions.\n\n   The District violated IDEA when it did not provide Appel-\nlants notice of the procedural safeguards of IDEA. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(3) (2000). Those safeguards, however, only notify\nthe parents about a pending evaluation. The District must pro-\nvide services only upon a determination of eligibility. Id.\n§§ 1414, 1415(j). It would be incongruous to compensate\nAppellants for services before the District had determined the\ntwins were eligible for them.\n\n  Appellants also argue the twins needed services. The twins’\nneeds, however, have no bearing on the procedural violation\n\f16718          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nthat occurred on May 7, 2003. Further, had the Appellants\nreceived notice of IDEA procedures, they would have learned\nthat the District had no obligation to provide services until\nafter the twins’ evaluations. This would likely have led\nAppellants to obtain services on their own.\n\n   The State Review Officer found and the District Court\naffirmed that the August 25, 2003, evaluations were timely\nunder IDEA. Appellants argue that the evaluation delay was\nunreasonable.6 The District argues that it complied with the\nstate administrative rule, a forty-five-school-day timeline for\nevaluating children. Nev. Admin. Code § 388.377(1)(A). We\nconsider what deference, if any, must be given by us to the\nNevada regulation based on the fact that the Secretary of Edu-\ncation approved it when determining to disburse IDEA funds.\nWe also consider whether, regardless of the Nevada regula-\ntion, the District’s actions in this instance were reasonable.\n\na.       The Nevada Statute and IDEA\n\n   [8] IDEA “leaves to the States the primary responsibility\nfor developing and executing educational programs for handi-\ncapped children, [but] it imposes significant requirements to\nbe followed in the discharge of that responsibility.” Rowley,\n458 U.S. at 183.

See id.\n§1414(a) (2000); 34 C.F.R. § 300.343 (1999).

We have also required\na timely evaluation in all areas of suspected disabilities. See\nHellgate Elem. Sch. Dist, 541 F.3d at 1209-10 (concluding\nthat a district that did not obtain an evaluation for autism for\nsix months denied the child a FAPE).\n\n   Department of Education letters interpreting and explaining\nIDEA have also emphasized the need for an initial evaluation\nto occur within a reasonable time. The Office of Special Edu-\ncation Programs, the principal office for administering IDEA,\nhas stated that an initial evaluation must be conducted “with-\nout undue delay.” Letter from Thomas Hehir, Dir., Office of\nSpecial Educ. Programs, to Jerry Saperstone, Mental Health\nServices System, 21 IDELR 1127 (OSEP 1994); see also 20\nU.S.C. § 1402 (2000). That Office also noted that the determi-\nnation of whether a school district did not conduct a timely\nevaluation according to IDEA and applicable state standards\nmust be made on a case-by-case basis. Letter from Stephanie\nSmith Lee, Dir., Office of Special Educ.

Although no specific timeline is given, implementation\nshould be done with all due haste.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 12581.\nThe Secretary’s refusal to adopt a specific timeline also sup-\nports the conclusion that the reasonableness of a child’s eval-\nuation depends on the individual circumstances.7\n\n   The Secretary of Education’s determination that a state’s\nprocedures comply with IDEA is entitled to some level of defer-\nence.8 See Lukhard v.

The Secretary’s finding that\nNevada’s regulations comply with IDEA requirements “cons-\ntitute[s] a body of experience and informed judgment to\nwhich [we] may properly resort for guidance.” See Skidmore\n  7\n     A year after the events in this case occurred, Congress amended the\nAct to allow for more state discretion in imposing timelines for an evalua-\ntion. The 2004 amendments to the Act require evaluations to occur “within\n60 days of receiving parental consent for the evaluation, or, if the State\nestablishes a timeframe within which the evaluation must be concluded,\nwithin such timeframe.” 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(C)(i)(I) (Supp. V 2005).\nIn promulgating regulations to implement this part of the statute, the\nDepartment of Education explicitly declined to state that sixty days was\nthe maximum timeframe.

While we recognize\nthe Secretary has this experience and judgment, we do not\nhave the benefit of a written interpretation or formal opinion.\nMoreover, when the Secretary approved the Nevada regula-\ntion generally as a condition to the state receiving federal\nfunds, he did not indicate that he determined that the time\nlimit was reasonable in each case. As such, we do not give the\nSecretary’s judgment much weight.\n\n   [11] We hold that Nevada’s forty-five-school-day timeline\nis not an inconsistent interpretation of IDEA’s reasonable\ntimeliness requirement. We do not hold, however, that it pro-\nvides school districts with a safe-harbor under the applicable\nstatute. Regardless of compliance with a state regulatory\nrequirement, IDEA requires that districts act within a reason-\nable time to evaluate potentially disabled children. To be sure,\na failure to comply with the state’s regulation is good evi-\ndence of unreasonable delay.9 But compliance with the regu-\nlation will not necessarily mean that in each case the school\ndistrict completed its investigation in a reasonable period. We\nare impressed that the purposes of the IDEA will be best ful-\nfilled when school districts act as expeditiously as is practi-\ncally possible to complete the evaluations of disabled\nchildren.\n\n   IDEA requires courts to consider each child’s case individ-\nually. See generally Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. To allow a state\nto use its regulations as a safe harbor in the absence of a con-\ngressional directive or regulation allowing for such would\nflout Congress’s intent that judicial review of IDEA claims be\nchild-specific. Compliance with the state regulation is rele-\nvant and should be considered, but the ultimate and disposi-\ntive question is whether the District acted in a reasonable\ntime.\n  9\n   Indeed, a violation of the state regulation would be actionable. Target\nRange, 960 F.2d at 1483 (“State standards that are not inconsistent with\nfederal standards [under IDEA] are also enforceable in federal court.”).\n\f16722       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nb.   The Reasonableness of the Evaluation Timeframe\n\n  The District was required to give Appellants notice and a\nconsent form on May 7, 2003. From that date until August 25,\n2003, when the twins began receiving services, is 110 calen-\ndar days and thirty-eight school days.\n\n   [12] The 110-day delay was reasonable in this case. Noth-\ning occurred at the June 20 Child Find Day that indicated the\nDistrict should expedite the evaluations. The earliest the Dis-\ntrict had any notice of suspected autism was July 28, 2003.\nThe District began evaluating the twins one month later and\nbegan administering tests for autism one month after that. The\nHearing Officer credited testimony that stated this one-month\ndelay was essential to produce valid test results. Premature\ntesting without requisite trust and comfort level between child\nand evaluator would be ineffective. Based on the testimony\nthat the Hearing Officer considered credible, the delay was\nnot unreasonable.\n\n   [13] Small administrative delays, like this one, and espe-\ncially delays needed to promote effective test results, should\nnot render the District’s actions unreasonable. It also makes\nsense to allow school districts a degree of leeway during sum-\nmer vacation. See Doe v. Metro. Nashville Pub. Schs., 9 F.\nApp’x. 453 (6th Cir. 2001) (upholding a six-month delay\nwhere the child was out of state, it occurred over the holidays,\nand it was difficult for the school to obtain requested informa-\ntion).\n\n   Our holding does not encompass a situation where a school\ndistrict simply delays in the face of a referral for a potentially\nautistic child solely because summer vacation makes a timely\nevaluation difficult. In Adams v. Oregon, the school district\nreduced a child’s services to accommodate district staff’s\nsummer vacation plans. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766693\"><a href=\"/opinion/766693/lucas-adams-by-and-through-his-parents-dave-adams-lisandra-adams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144 (9th Cir. 1999).\nThe reduction had no bearing on the child’s unique needs and\ntherefore deprived the child of a FAPE.

Here, the District completed\nthe twins’ evaluations within three months of receiving notice\nthat the children potentially suffered from autism.\n\n   We give “due weight” to the administrative proceedings.\nVan Duyn, 502 F.3d at 817. The State Review Officer care-\nfully considered the record and found the District evaluated\nthe twins in a reasonable timeframe. Specifically, the State\nReview Officer found the Hearing Officer’s conclusion that\nextended school year days should be included in the forty-\nfive-school-day timeline was error. Without including those\ndays, the District had complied with the timeline. He further\nfound that the District had evaluated the twins in a reasonable\ntime. He noted that this was not a case, like Adams, where the\nDistrict had reduced services solely for its own convenience.\nRather, the State Review Officer concluded that the District\nneeded to coordinate its obligations to many children over the\nsummer while also meeting the forty-five-school-day time-\nline. Relying on the Hearing Officer’s finding that the District\nstaff had no reasonable basis to suspect the twins were autistic\non June 20, 2003, he concluded that the August 15, 2003\nassessment date was reasonable. Having considered the record\nand the arguments presented by the parties as well as the\napplicable law, we will not disturb the State Review Officer’s\nfinding.\n\n  [14] We hold that the district court abused its discretion in\nreducing the reimbursement of evaluation costs. The district\n\f16724       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in declining to award costs\nfor services that the twins received between June 23 and\nAugust 24, 2003.\n\nB.   The August 2003 IEPs\n\n1.   Alleged Procedural Violation\n\n   Appellants argue that the District did not comply with pro-\ncedures set forth in the Act in conducting the August 25,\n2003, evaluations. Specifically, Appellants urge us to con-\nclude that the District did not conduct a proper evaluation\nbecause it did not test the twins for autism before it finalized\nthe August 2003, IEPs. Appellants further assert that even if\nthe District did comply with IDEA procedures in conducting\nthe evaluations, the developed IEPs were not reasonably cal-\nculated to benefit the twins.\n\n    The district court found that the August 25, 2003, evalua-\ntions were “full and individual initial evaluations,” as required\nby IDEA. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(a)(1)(A) (2000). IDEA requires\nthat a school district use “a variety of assessment tools and\nstrategies . . . [and] use technically sound instruments.” Id.\n§ 1414(a)(2)(A),(C). Any standardized tests must “have been\nvalidated for the specific purpose for which they are used; . . .\nadministered by trained and knowledgeable personnel; and\n. . . administered in accordance with any instructions provided\nby the producer of such tests.” Id. § 1414(b)(3). The evalua-\ntions must be “sufficiently comprehensive to identify all of\nthe child’s special education and related service needs,\nwhether or not commonly linked to the disability category in\nwhich the child has been classified.” 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.532(2)(h) (1999).\n\n   Appellants argue that the District did not fulfill these\nrequirements and that the District did not evaluate the twins\nwithin the meaning of IDEA. Appellants contend that the Dis-\ntrict should have assessed the twins using Wechsler’s Pre-\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT         16725\nschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence, the Childhood\nAutism Rating Scale, and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary\nTests. The District used these tests in October.\n\n   The District responds that administering these tests in\nAugust would have violated IDEA’s requirement that it\nadminister the assessments in the manner most likely to yield\naccurate information. Id. These tests would not yield valid\nresults until the twins had become familiar with the District\nstaff, particularly in light of the twins’ unwillingness to\nrespond to the staff’s questions.\n\n   The District administered several tests before the August\n25, 2003, IEP meeting: the twins’ mother completed a ques-\ntionnaire on May 5, 2003; a District staff member gave\nAssessments of Phonological Process on June 20, 2003; and\nthe District administered AGS Early Screening Profile Home/\nHealth Questionnaires providing information about parent/\nchild interactions and the twins’ health.\n\n   The Hearing Officer, State Review Officer, and district\ncourt all found the August evaluations were evaluations\nwithin the meaning of IDEA, crediting the District’s staff tes-\ntimony about the dubious reliability of tests administered too\nearly. While the Center administered some autism tests quite\nearly, the Discrete Trial Teacher did not even begin evaluat-\ning the twins until one month after she began observing\nthem—month after they began attending the Center, lending\nfurther credence to the District’s contentions. Some of the\nstaff at the Center did not believe the twins were autistic as\nlate as August 15, 2003. Thus, although the Center had stated\nits suspicions as early as July 28, 2003, its results then were\nnot definitive.\n\n  [15] The Hearing Officer’s findings were “thorough and\ncareful” and are thus due greater deference. See Napa Valley\nUnified Sch. Dist., 496 F.3d at 937 (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted). The Hearing Officer found the District\n\f16726       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nPsychologist’s testimony credible and she noted that some of\nthe mandatory tests for autism require observation of the child\nfor over a month. Giving the Hearing Officer due deference,\nwe agree that the District could not effectively administer the\nautism tests until after the test administrators had gotten to\nknow the twins. Because the District could not immediately\nadminister the tests for autism in a valid manner, as required\nby IDEA, the August evaluations qualify as initial evaluations\nunder IDEA. 34 C.F.R. §§ 300.531, 300.532 (1999).\n\n   In Hellgate, we determined that the IEP team could not\ndevelop a plan reasonably calculated to provide the child with\na meaningful educational benefit for the school year without\nan autism evaluation. Hellgate Elem. Sch. Dist., 541 F.3d at\n1209-10. The district in Hellgate received notice that the child\ncould be autistic in August but did not obtain an evaluation\nand convene an IEP meeting to address the child’s autism\nuntil March. See id. at 1205-06. By contrast, the District here\nconvened IEP meetings to address the twins’ autism within\ntwo months of finalizing the original IEPs. The District had\ntaken the time necessary to conduct proper and valid assess-\nments and then had begun addressing what additional services\nthe twins needed.\n\n   Because we hold that the August evaluations qualify as ini-\ntial evaluations under IDEA, we reject the contention that\nthere was at the outset a lack of evaluations resulting in the\ndenial of a FAPE.\n\n2.   Alleged Substantive Violation\n\n   Appellants also argue that the August IEPs were not rea-\nsonably calculated to provide the twins with educational bene-\nfits because the IEPs did not address the twins’ autism. We\nconsider the IEP at the time of its implementation, not in\nhindsight, and ask if its methods were reasonably calculated\nto confer an educational benefit on the child. Adams, 195 F.3d\nat 1149.\n\f              JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                   16727\n   The twins received ninety minutes of speech and language\nservices twice a week, and the Special Education Teacher\nindividualized the twins’ services in the TEDDY program by\nrelying on index cards. These services gave the twins educa-\ntional benefits. Importantly, the District was pursuing autism\neligibility determinations. The District, however, reasonably\ncalculated that the August IEPs could confer educational ben-\nefits on the twins based on the tests that the District could val-\nidly administer in August. Further, the twins made progress in\ncertain areas while they attended the TEDDY program. Their\nIEPs that were developed after the autism determination con-\ntinued their placement in the TEDDY program.\n\n  Finally, Appellants also argue that the twins’ August IEPs\nwere not individually tailored.10 IDEA requires IEPs be indi-\nvidual tailored to the unique needs of each child. Amanda J.,\n267 F.3d at 894. The August 15, 2003, assessments only\nshowed one difference between the twins regarding motor\nskills. Because this was the only distinction between the twins\nin the tests that the District could validly administer in\nAugust, the lack of individualization is not surprising. The\nDistrict planned more tests as soon as it could effectively\nadminister them.\n\n  [16] We hold that the District provided the children with a\nFAPE from August 25 until October 21 and November 4,\n2003.\n  10\n    Appellants also suggest that it was impermissible that the District\nbegan the August IEP meeting with identical pre-written IEPs. This does\nnot invalidate the substance or development of the IEPs. 64 Fed. Reg. at\n12478-79. Appellants put forth no evidence that the District presented the\nIEPs in a “take it or leave it” position, which would have constituted error.\nSee Ms. S. ex rel. G., v. Vashon Island Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782921\"><a href=\"/opinion/782921/ms-s-for-herself-and-on-behalf-of-her-daughter-g-v-vashon-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131\n(9th Cir. 2003).\n\f16728         JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nC.     The October and November IEPs.\n\n   Appellants also raise a substantive challenge to the October\nand November IEPs. They contend that the District could not\nimplement the October and November IEPs and that these\nIEPs were not reasonably calculated to confer an educational\nbenefit. Specifically, Appellants argue that the District had no\nbehavior analyst on staff. A behavior analyst would be quali-\nfied to perform functional analysis and supervise the staff in\nthe implementation of a discrete trial training program. The\nDistrict responds that IDEA does not require a district to\nemploy a behavior analyst. Rather, it requires the District to\nemploy an individual with Nevada State Education Agency-\nrecognized certification, licensing, or registration. 34 C.F.R.\n§ 300.23.\n\n   The Hearing Officer’s detailed findings of fact, adopted by\nthe State Review Officer and affirmed by the district court,\ndemonstrate that the District did have personnel capable of\nimplementing the IEPs. The District had contracted with two\nprivate behavior analysts for support in implementing the dis-\ncrete trial training program.11 Trained personnel from the Uni-\nversity of Nevada would perform functional behavior analysis\nat the twins’ home and school.\n\n   The District Special Education Teacher had been concerned\nabout her abilities to implement the IEPs in early October.\nAfter she learned the District would provide her with addi-\ntional training, she stated that she felt confident that she could\nimplement the IEPs. Although the parents preferred that the\n  11\n     Appellants also argue that the independent contractor would use the\ntwins as guinea pigs for training. A District staff member testified that the\nbehavior analysts would “train our staff members using [JG] and examples\nwith him, but that since they were not going to be there 15 hours a week\ntheir function was to build capacity amongst our people.” The testimony\nsuggests that the behavior analysts would deliver some discrete trials to\nthe twins as examples to help train the teachers. It does not suggest that\nthey would have an untrained teacher deliver discrete trials.\n\f            JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16729\nDistrict hire the Center’s discrete trial training instructor, we\nfocus on the District’s proposed implementation plan, not the\nparents’ preferred alternative.

Reg. 12440 & 12579 (March 12, 1999) (implementing\n34 C.F.R. § 300.342 and comments). The evidence shows that\nthe District would have had qualified staff within a reasonable\namount of time, but the parents did not allow the District to\nprovide services.\n\n  [17] We hold that the District had adequate resources to\nimplement the October and November IEPs.\n\nD.   The Rehabilitation Act claim\n\n   For the first time in district court, Appellants added a Claim\nof discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act. Appellees\nargued that this claim was improperly presented because it\nwas unexhausted. They also argued that the claim should lose\non its merits. The District first made the exhaustion argument\nin its reply brief to its summary judgment motion. The Dis-\ntrict had assumed the Rehabilitation Act claim was a claim for\na denial of a FAPE, not an unexhausted claim that the District\nhad discriminated against the twins by segregating them.\nAppellants argue that the district court erred in granting the\nDistrict’s summary judgment motion and denying their cross-\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n  The grant or denial of summary judgment is a conclusion\nof law, reviewed de novo. See Amanda J., 267 F.3d at 887.\n\n   IDEA is not an exclusive remedy for children with disabili-\nties who complain of failures in their education. See Mark H.,\n513 F.3d at 925 (concluding that the availability of relief\n\f16730          JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nunder IDEA does not limit the availability of relief under the\nRehabilitation Act). Nevertheless, IDEA requires that when a\nplaintiff files an action that seeks relief under another statute,\nand that relief is also available under IDEA, he or she must\nfollow IDEA exhaustion procedures. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(l)\n(2000); Robb v. Bethel Sch. Dist. #403, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779631\"><a href=\"/opinion/779631/danicia-robb-lovie-robb-as-parents-and-guardians-of-latosha-robb-latosha/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1047</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1050\n(9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   Appellants went through the administrative process but did\nnot argue that the District discriminated against the twins by\nsegregating them. Appellants argue that their lack of exhaus-\ntion is not fatal to their claim because their segregation claim\ncould not be heard in an IDEA due process hearing. Neverthe-\nless, § 1415(b)(6) allows claims “with respect to any matter\nrelating to the identification, evaluation, or educational place-\nment of the child, or the provision of a free appropriate public\neducation” to be heard. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6) (emphasis\nadded). Further, the parents in Mark H. presented their Reha-\nbilitation Act claim during the administrative process, even\nthough the hearing officer did not rule on the issue. Appel-\nlants also could have argued their discrimination claim in the\nhearing. Mark H., 513 F.3d at 927 n.3.12\n  12\n      The partial dissent argues that because all of the “educational issues”\nwere exhausted, we should conclude that Appellants adequately exhausted\ntheir Rehabilitation Act claim. There are two primary problems with the\npartial dissent’s analysis: First, in Blanchard v. Morton v. School Disrict,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791641\"><a href=\"/opinion/791641/cheryl-blanchard-v-morton-school-district-russ-davis-regine-aleksunas-se/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 920-21 (9th Cir. 2005), we stated that “[t]he dispositive\nquestion . . . is whether Blanchard is seeking remedy for injuries that could\nbe redressed to any degree by the IDEA’s administrative procedures.” Id.\nat 921. As we see it, the ALJ could have ordered the District to place the\ntwins in regular preschool programing, remedying Appellants’ alleged\ninjury to some degree. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(k)(3)(B)(ii). Therefore, even\nunder Blanchard, exhaustion was required. Second, in Witte and Blan-\nchard, the parties had resolved “educational issues” to mutual satisfaction,\nand none of their injuries could have been redressed by recourse to the\nIDEA exhaustion process. We see a different case where the parties are\nstill litigating their educational issues and the administrative process might\nhave been used in attempt to gain a remedy for their alleged injury.\n\f               JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT                    16731\n   Appellants argue that the District has waived its exhaustion\ndefense. There is some question regarding whether IDEA’s\nexhaustion requirement is jurisdictional, or whether a district\ncould waive this argument. See Coleman v. Newburgh\nEnlarged City Sch.

The District did not forfeit the argument. The Dis-\ntrict raised it as soon as the nature of Appellants’ Rehabilita-\ntion Act claim became clear. Once the District learned that the\nclaim was not arguing that the District had denied Appellants\na FAPE, they moved to amend their answer and asserted the\nexhaustion defense. The District’s treatment of this exhaus-\ntion issue in our view was timely.13\n\n   [18] Appellants did not properly present the claim to the\ndistrict court. The District had no notice that Appellants con-\nsidered the twins’ placement discriminatory. Therefore, we\nvacate the district court’s order granting the District summary\njudgment and hold that this claim should have been dismissed\nwithout prejudice for lack of jurisdiction.14\n  13\n      Even though the issue was not raised in the opposition brief, under our\nprecedent we can consider the issue because it was raised explicitly in the\nAppellant’s brief.

DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16733\n   In the district court, the Appellants contended for the first\ntime that the District’s placement of the twins in the TEDDY\nprogram constituted intentional discrimination under the\nRehabilitation Act. The Appellants contended the District,\nrather than making an individualized determination regarding\nthe twins’ needs, simply labeled the twins “disabled,” and\nassigned the twins to special education. This, the Appellants\nclaimed, constituted “segregation.” The Appellants sought\nmonetary damages, a form of relief unavailable under the\nIDEA. See Witte v. Clark County Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766962\"><a href=\"/opinion/766962/shawn-witte-a-minor-by-his-next-friend-and-parent-teresa-witte-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1275 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n   The IDEA requires a plaintiff to exhaust administrative\nremedies before filing suit under another statute if the plaintiff\nis “seeking relief that is also available under” the IDEA. 20\nU.S.C. § 1415(l). Though Appellants seek some relief not\navailable under IDEA, they were nevertheless required to pur-\nsue those remedies that were available to them in state admin-\nistrative proceedings; their claims could have been redressed,\nto an extent, by remedies available under the IDEA. See Robb\nv. Bethel Sch. Dist.

Id. Appellants have pursued\nor are pursuing all those remedies available to them under the\nIDEA. And, in the state administrative proceeding, Appellants\ncontended the District assigned the twins to the TEDDY pro-\ngram without undertaking the individualized evaluation\nrequired by law. The plaintiffs in Robb, by contrast, failed to\nfile any administrative claim whatsoever. See id.\n\n   In two cases, we permitted a plaintiff who first seeks\nadministrative relief in state IDEA proceedings to file a sepa-\nrate suit for damages under § 1983 or the Rehabilitation Act.\nIn Witte, the plaintiffs sought monetary damages under\n§ 1983, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Americans with Dis-\nabilities Act for emotional and physical abuse by school\n\f16734       JG v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT\nemployees. 197 F.3d at 1276. In Blanchard v. Morton School\nDistrict, the mother of a disabled child sought money dam-\nages under § 1983 for emotional distress and lost wages\ncaused by the school district’s “deliberate indifference” to her\nson’s IDEA claims. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791641\"><a href=\"/opinion/791641/cheryl-blanchard-v-morton-school-district-russ-davis-regine-aleksunas-se/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 919 (9th Cir. 2005). In both\nWitte and Blanchard, we held that the plaintiffs were not\nrequired to advance the claim for damages in state IDEA pro-\nceedings, provided the plaintiff had raised all of the “educa-\ntional issues” implicated by the child’s disability in the IDEA\nproceeding. Id. at 921-22; Witte, 197 F.3d at 1275.\n\n   In short, Witte and Blanchard stand for the principle that\nonce a plaintiff has raised all of the “educational issues” asso-\nciated with an IDEA claim in a state administrative proceed-\ning, nothing prevents him from asserting a claim for damages\nin district court alleging a defendant school district also vio-\nlated other statutory provisions. Such an approach fulfills the\npurposes of exhaustion—providing courts with expert assis-\ntance and offering state officials the first opportunity to cor-\nrect an educational deficiency, see Robb, 308 F.3d at 1051—\nwithout forcing plaintiffs to engage in the futile gesture of\nraising damages claims in state administrative proceedings,\nwhere the agency lacks the power to award such relief.\n\n   Here, Appellants have resolved all of the “educational\nissues” associated with their claims. Appellants contended in\nstate administrative proceedings that the District’s evaluation\nof the twins was deficient and that the twins’ assignment to\nthe TEDDY program did not meet the twins’ educational\nneeds. The only new issue raised by Appellants’ Rehabilita-\ntion Act claim is an allegation that the District acted with dis-\ncriminatory intent. In the IDEA proceedings, the intent with\nwhich a district acts in failing to provide a FAPE is irrelevant;\nonly the result of its actions or inactions matter. Nor is the\nDistrict’s intent an “educational issue” the resolution of which\nrequires the expert guidance of a state administrator. Cf.\nKutasi v. Las Virgines Unified Sch.

DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT           16735\n   I would instead affirm the district court’s order granting\nsummary judgment in favor of the Appellee. Where a district\nassigns a student to special education pursuant to a valid IEP,\nthe district is not liable for intentional discrimination under\n§ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Mark H. v. Lemahiu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1272595\"><a href=\"/opinion/1272595/mark-h-v-lemahieu/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934 (9th Cir. 2008). Because I agree that the Dis-\ntrict provided the twins valid IEPs, I would affirm the district\ncourt’s decision on the merits, rather than conclude the district\ncourt lacked jurisdiction over Appellants’ Rehabilitation Act\nclaims.\n\f</pre>",
