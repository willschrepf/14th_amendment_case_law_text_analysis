In February of 2000, the City of\nLafayette, Indiana, issued John Doe, a convicted sex offender,\na letter, informing him that he was banned from all public\nparks under the City’s jurisdiction. In November of 2000,\nMr. Doe initiated this action, alleging that the ban violated\nhis rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\nthe Constitution of the United States. The United States\n\f2                                               No. 01-3624\n\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana granted\nsummary judgment to the City. For the reasons set forth in\nthe following opinion, we now affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n\n                             I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n  John Doe has a long history of arrests and convictions for\nsexually related crimes. In most of these instances, children\nwere the victims. His criminal history includes convictions\nfor child molestation, attempted child molestation, voyeur-\nism, exhibitionism and peeping. These crimes date back to\n1978, when Mr. Doe went into a locker room at a local\nschool, pulled down the swimsuit of a ten-year-old boy and\nperformed oral sex on him. The next year, Mr. Doe forcibly\nperformed oral sex on a twelve-year-old boy. He approached\nthe boy in the parking lot of a local school and asked the\nboy to unzip his pants; after the boy refused, Mr. Doe un-\nzipped the boy’s pants and performed oral sex on him. In\n1985, Mr. Doe admitted to peeping into windows of an\napartment of a female at 1:20 a.m. In 1986, Mr. Doe admitted\nto masturbating in full view of three children who lived in\nthe home next door. During questioning on this incident,\nthe police also asked Mr. Doe if he recalled “masturbating\non the back porch with one of the next door neighbor child-\nren and another friend out in the back yard.” Reed Aff.\nEx.D. Mr. Doe answered: “That’s possible.” Id. In May of\n1988, Mr. Doe was arrested for peeping into the windows of\nan apartment in West Lafayette. In October of 1988, he\nadmitted to standing outside a house, looking through a\nwindow at what he perceived to be a teenage boy and\nmasturbating with his penis exposed. He also admitted this\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  3\n\nbehavior occurred on a number of previous occasions in\nthen-recent history. Mr. Doe explained to police: “[I]t’s\nhappened times before, you know that. I’ve told you this\nbefore I’m still seeing a therapist and working on it, but\nI . . . . I can’t make any excuses. I mean ahh it just happens.\nAhh.” Reed Aff. Ex.F. In May of 1990, Mr. Doe was arrested\nfor public intoxication and resisting law enforcement\nfollowing a report that he was tapping on the rear window\nof a female’s house. In October of 1990, Mr. Doe whistled to\nthree teenage boys—ages ten, fourteen and fifteen—and\nmotioned for them to come into an alley near the Village\nPantry. See Reed Aff. ¶ 4(h). He asked the boys if they wanted\nto receive oral sex, and he also unzipped his pants. The\nthree boys fled the area. This incident resulted in Mr. Doe’s\nlast conviction, which was finalized in 1991. Mr. Doe was\nplaced on house arrest from January of 1992 to January of\n1996. See Doe Dep. at 17. He then was on probation until\nearly January of 2000. See id.\n  We now come to the incident that precipitated the situ-\nation before us. In January of 2000, Mr. Doe’s probation\nofficer, Joe Hooker, received a call from a “confidential\nsource,” informing Officer Hooker that Mr. Doe “had been\n‘cruising’ parks and watching young children.” Reed Dep.\nEx.1. The anonymous caller recounted an incident that oc-\ncurred earlier that January. Mr. Doe’s own description of\nthis episode, in his deposition, vividly describes what took\nplace:\n    A. Well, I parked my car at Parkside Pharmacy across\n       from Murdock Park. I saw three males and two fe-\n       males on the ball diamond there at Murdock Park.\n    Q. Kids?\n    A. Possibly early to mid teens, so yeah, they were under-\n       age. I walked over to the ball diamond. By the time I\n\f4                                                    No. 01-3624\n\n          got over there, they were behind the—there’s a drop-\n          off, a valley or whatever down behind the ball dia-\n          mond that leads over to Ferry Street, I believe. They\n          were down in that area, and I stood there and\n          watched them for a while, probably 15 minutes,\n          maybe a half-hour, I said to myself: I’ve got to get out\n          of here before I do something, I left.\n    ...\n    Q. What was your purpose in going to Murdock Park\n       that Saturday evening?\n    A. Well, as I was going home that night, instead of going\n       my usual route, I took a side street, and one side street\n       led to another, led to another, led to another, and\n       before I knew it, I was at Columbian Park, and so then\n       I decided just to go over to Murdock Park. I don’t\n       know. I guess I was, for whatever reason, I was in the\n       mood of cruising.\n    Q. What do you mean by “cruising”?\n    A. Just looking to see what’s there.\n    Q. Looking for children?\n    A. Mostly, yeah.\n    Q. Were you having those urges that night?\n    A. Yeah, you could probably say that, yeah, yes.\n    Q. When you got out of the car and walked into\n       Murdock Park, what were you thinking about?\n    ...\n    A. When I saw the three, the four kids there, my thoughts\n       were thoughts I had before when I see children, pos-\n       sibly expose myself to them, I thought about the pos-\n       sibility of, you know, having some kind of sexual\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   5\n\n        contact with the kids, but I know with four kids there,\n        that’s pretty difficult to do. It’s a wide open area.\n        Those thoughts were there, but they, you know,\n        weren’t realistic at the time. They were just thoughts.\nDoe Dep. at 27-29.\n  Officer Hooker forwarded the information from the anon-\nymous caller to the Lafayette Police Department. Robert\nReed, Lafayette’s Police Chief, was aware of Mr. Doe’s\ncriminal history, and he initiated discussions with various\nofficials regarding the appropriate response. He contacted\nVicki Mayes, Superintendent of the Lafayette Parks and\nRecreation Department, and Dr. Ed Eiler, Superintendent of\nthe Lafayette School Corporation, and advised them to issue\na ban ordering Mr. Doe not to enter the City’s public parks\nor schools. Chief Reed explained that he gave this advice\n“because of the duty I have to protect the citizens, and\nspecifically the children of this community, from the im-\nminent danger posed by John Doe.” Reed Aff. ¶ 5.\n  On February 2, 2000, Superintendent Mayes sent a letter\nto Mr. Doe informing him that he was prohibited from en-\n                        1\ntering the City’s parks, and, on February 3, 2000, Dr. Eiler\nsent Mr. Doe a letter informing him that he was prohibited\nfrom coming on school grounds. Neither of the bans, which\nare still in effect, have a termination date nor are they\nlimited to certain geographical areas within the public prop-\n\n\n1\n  The City has a variety of parks, some large and some small,\nsome in neighborhoods and some not, some developed and some\nundeveloped. Within the parks are numerous traditional play-\nground areas, softball fields, swimming pools, a zoo and a golf\ncourse. The City’s park system also hosts a range of activities,\nincluding birthday parties, family reunions and an annual Easter\negg hunt. See Mayes Dep. at 4-10.\n\f6                                                    No. 01-3624\n\nerty at issue. In this case, Mr. Doe challenges only the ban from\nthe public parks, and not the public schools. He claims that he\nwould like to go to the parks to play softball, watch the Colt\n                2\nWorld Series, attend a company outing if one takes place at\none of the City’s parks and take walks with friends. See Doe\nAff. ¶ 7. However, Mr. Doe also testified that, other than the\nJanuary 2000 evening in question, he has not been in a city\npark since his 1990 arrest. See Doe Dep. at 30.\n  Mr. Doe is currently continuing therapy under the super-\nvision of Dr. Patricia C. Moisan-Thomas. From 1986 until his\n1990 arrest, he saw Dr. Moisan-Thomas “off and on . . .\nprobably maybe once a month.” Doe Dep. at 31. From 1990\nto present, he has seen her “pretty much on a weekly basis.”\nId. Mr. Doe also currently attends a self-help group for sex-\nual addicts, and, at some point after January of 2000, he\nvoluntarily began taking medications to control his sexual\nurges. See Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 20. Mr. Doe and Dr.\nMoisan-Thomas both testified that “Mr. Doe, like any other\naddict, does not have control over his thoughts” and that he\n“will always have inappropriate thoughts.” Moisan-Thomas\nAff. ¶ 9; Doe Aff. ¶ 6 (“I recognize that I will always have\ninappropriate thoughts regarding having sexual contact with\nchildren.”). Mr. Doe and Dr. Moisan-Thomas also believe that,\nin the last ten years, he has learned how to resist these\ninappropriate urges. Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 27, 33-34; Doe\nAff. ¶ 6. In this regard, Dr. Moisan-Thomas opined that the\nJanuary incident in the park was a “good thing,” at least for\nMr. Doe, because “[i]t gave him the opportunity to use his\nrelapse prevention program and to learn about his limits.”\nMoisan-Thomas Dep. at 27-28. Still, Dr. Moisan-Thomas\nreadily concedes that she can give “absolutely no[ ]” guar-\n\n\n2\n   According to the record, “Colt” is a baseball “league of young\nfifteen, sixteen, [and] seventeen-year-old males.” Mayes Dep. at 6.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                 7\n\nantee that Mr. Doe will not reoffend, and, when asked if\nsexual addicts, such as Mr. Doe, “do fall down that slippery\nslope sometimes,” Dr. Moisan-Thomas responded: “Some-\ntimes they do.” Id. at 35.\n\n\nB. District Court Proceedings\n  On September 14, 2001, the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Indiana granted summary judg-\nment to the City on Mr. Doe’s claims under the First and\nFourteenth Amendments. See Doe v. City of Lafayette, 160 F.\nSupp. 2d 996 (N.D. Ind. 2001).\n\n\n                1. First Amendment Claim\n   The district court began by noting that “[o]rdinarily, in\norder for a violation of the First Amendment to occur, there\nfirst must be some form of expressive speech or conduct\nthat is intended to convey a message.” Id. at 1000. However,\nthe court held, Mr. Doe had not articulated any form of\nexpressive conduct which was impinged by his ban from\nthe City’s parks. Furthermore, the district court rejected Mr.\nDoe’s contention that his right to freedom of thought was\ninfringed because he was being punished merely for inap-\npropriate thoughts. “[N]ot only did he have these thoughts,”\nthe court explained, “but . . . he acted upon them by going\nto the Park and actively seeking out the children.” Id. at\n1001. The court concluded by holding that, to the extent the\nban had any impact on Mr. Doe’s thoughts, that impact was\nincidental, and a mere incidental impact upon a citizen’s\nthoughts does not bar a municipality from advancing a\nlegitimate governmental interest, such as protection of its\nyouth. See id. at 1000-01 (discussing Paris Adult Theatre I v.\nSlaton, 413 U.S. 49, 67 (1973) (“[T]he mere fact that, as a\n\f8                                                     No. 01-3624\n\nconsequence, some human ‘utterances’ or ‘thoughts’ may be\nincidentally affected does not bar the State from acting to\nprotect legitimate state interests.”)). Accordingly, the court\nheld that the ban did not infringe any of Mr. Doe’s First\nAmendment rights.\n\n\n             2. Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n   The district court began by framing Mr. Doe’s Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claim as follows: “Doe\nclaims that the ban order violates his alleged fundamental\nright to enjoy and wander through a public park.” Id. at\n1001. The court noted that a plurality of the Supreme Court\nin City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41 (1999), stated:\n“[F]reedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the\n‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id. at 53.\nHowever, the district court held Morales inapplicable to this\ncase because Mr. Doe’s “purposes” for going in the park\n                        3\nwere not “innocent.” City of Lafayette, 160 F. Supp. 2d at\n1002. The district court also considered Morales inapplicable\nbecause it “was decided primarily on grounds of over\nbreadth and vagueness,” and the court found those issues\nwere not implicated in this case. Id. Apart from Morales, the\ncourt also rejected the notion that there was a broader fun-\ndamental right to intrastate travel or freedom of movement\n\n\n3\n  The district court noted that Mr. Doe submitted several “in-\nnocent” activities for which he would like to enter the parks, such\nas softball. “However,” the court explained, “Doe has not used\nthe city’s park system for such normal innocent purposes within\nthe previous ten years, rather his only visit to the park was in\nresponse to his sexual urge to watch innocent children play in the\npark and act in some criminal or inappropriate manner with\nthose children.” Doe v. City of Lafayette, 160 F. Supp. 2d 996, 1002\n(N.D. Ind. 2001).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                       9\n\nimplicated by the ban. Id. at 1003 (discussing, among other\ncases, Thompson v. Ashe, 250 F.3d 399, 406-07 (6th Cir. 2001)).\n  Because it had determined that Mr. Doe’s substantive due\nprocess claim did not implicate a fundamental right, the\ndistrict court then considered the ban under a rational basis\nstandard. It concluded that the City had a strong and\nlegitimate interest in protecting its youth. It further con-\ncluded that the ban was “narrowly tailored to the specific\nfacts and circumstances involving Doe and therefore ad-\nvances the legitimate goals of the city.” Id. at 1004. There-\nfore, the court held, the ban did not violate Mr. Doe’s right\nto substantive due process.\n\n\n                                II\n                         DISCUSSION\n  Mr. Doe, by his own admission, is a sexual addict with a\nproclivity toward children. He always will have sexual urges\ntoward children; the only question is whether he can control\nthem. On the January 2000 evening in question, his control\nwas, charitably stated, marginal. He was having sexual urges\ntoward children; he went “cruising” in the parks in search of\nchildren; he saw children at Murdock Park; he got out of his\ncar and he “thought about the possibility of, you know,\nhaving some kind of sexual contact with the kids.” Doe Dep.\nat 28-29. Mr. Doe brought himself to the brink. Fortunately\nfor the children, and Mr. Doe, there were at least four\n               4\nchildren there, and Mr. Doe “kn[ew] with four kids there,\nthat’s [having sexual contact with children] pretty difficult\n\n\n4\n  Mr. Doe earlier testified that there were five children at Murdock\nPark that evening. See Doe Dep. at 27.\n\f10                                                No. 01-3624\n\nto do. It’s a wide open area. Those thoughts were there, but\nthey, you know weren’t realistic at the time. They were just\nthoughts.” Id.\n  What if there were only one child there that evening?\nWould Mr. Doe have succumbed to his urges and consid-\nered the opportunity more “realistic”? Mr. Doe’s deposition\ntestimony suggests the answer. Fortunately, on that January\nevening, Mr. Doe passed up the opportunity to gratify com-\npletely his urges. Fortunately as well, through an anony-\nmous caller, the City of Lafayette found out that Mr. Doe\nhad engaged in psychiatric brinkmanship and endangered\nsome of the City’s most vulnerable citizens, children, in a\nplace where children should be safe to enjoy the premises,\nbut where, unfortunately, they also are quite susceptible to\nabuse, a park. Of course, the City was aware of not only this\nincident, but also of Mr. Doe’s criminal history. City officials\nunderstandably concluded that they had a duty to take\naction to protect the children. The course they chose was to\nban Mr. Doe from the City’s parks.\n  Mr. Doe does not believe that the officials’ chosen course\nwas a constitutionally permissible one. He submits that the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution pro-\nhibit the City from taking this action. The district court dis-\nagreed; it granted summary judgment to the City. We\nreview that decision de novo. See Rogers v. City of Chicago,\n320 F.3d 748, 752 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\n\nA. First Amendment Claim\n  The First Amendment states in relevant part: “Congress\nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.”\nU.S. Const. amend. I. Our first task is to ascertain whether\nany of the values protected by this provision are implicated\nin the situation before us.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                      11\n\n                                1.\n  At the core of the First Amendment is the protection of the\nright to self-expression. Constitutional jurisprudence gives\nthis constitutional value a generous ambit, protecting self-\n                                 5\nexpression in its myriad forms.\n  Keeping in mind the broad scope of this constitutional\nprotection, we nevertheless find no such value at stake in\nthe factual record before us. Mr. Doe makes very clear why\nhe went to the park. He did not go to the park to advocate\nthe legalization of sexual relations between adults and\nminors. He did not go into the park to display a sculpture,\nread a poem or perform a play celebrating sexual relations\nbetween adults and minors. He did not go into the park for\nsome higher purpose of self-realization through expression.\nIn fact, he did not go into the park to engage in expression\nat all. Rather, he went “cruising” in the parks “looking for\nchildren” to satisfy his sexual urges. He certainly was aware\nof his propensity in this regard and, of course, of his history\nof sexual assault. Nevertheless, he put himself in a situation\nthat increased, substantially, the not-so-remote possibility of\nhis acting on these impulses. On this factual record, it is\ndifficult to ascertain how the freedom of self-expression is\n             6\nimplicated.\n\n\n5\n  For example, protection has been extended to the reading of\nobscene material in one’s home, see Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557\n(1969), profanity, see Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971),\nsymbolic expression, see Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), flag\nburning, see id., and commercial speech, see Virginia State Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748\n(1976).\n6\n  Notably, Mr. Doe has not claimed that the ban is overbroad be-\ncause it prohibits too much speech or expression. Indeed, there is\n                                                    (continued...)\n\f12                                                  No. 01-3624\n\n  There can be no doubt that, among the kinds of expression\nprotected by the First Amendment is conduct with a\nsignificant expressive element. The Supreme Court has long\nheld that the First Amendment protects a broad range of\nspeech and conduct, but only “conduct with a significant\nexpressive element that drew the legal remedy in the first\nplace.” Arcara v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 706 (1986).\nThis principle is well-established. See United States v. O’Brien,\n391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) (articulating and applying a four-\npart test for judging the validity of content-neutral regula-\ntions that incidentally impact expression). More recent\npronouncements of the Supreme Court have confirmed its\nviability. See Arcara, 478 U.S. at 706-07. Our own case law\nhas reiterated this rule. See Hodgkins ex rel. Hodgkins v.\nPeterson, 355 F.3d 1048, 1057 (7th Cir. 2004) (explaining that\nthe O’Brien test and the time, place and manner analysis of\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781 (1989), “can be\napplied only to governmental regulation of conduct that has\nan expressive element or to regulations directed at activity\nwith no expressive component but which nevertheless\nimpose a disproportionate burden on those engaged in\nprotected First Amendment activity”). Indeed, although the\nSupreme Court has defined the boundaries of expression\nbroadly, see supra n.5, it never has extended the protections\nof the First Amendment to non-expressive conduct.\n   Consequently, Mr. Doe’s prohibition from the park only\ntriggers First Amendment scrutiny if he can demonstrate\n\n\n6\n  (...continued)\nnothing in the record to suggest that Mr. Doe has ever used the\nCity’s parks for expression, and his stated reasons for wanting to\nuse the parks in the future are unrelated to expression. See Doe\nAff. ¶ 7.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   13\n\nthat his conduct in going to the park in search of children to\nsatisfy deviant desires somehow was infused with an\nexpressive element. See Clark v. Cmty. for Creative Non-\nViolence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 n.5 (1984) (“[I]t is the obligation\nof the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive\nconduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment even\napplies. To hold otherwise would be to create a rule that all\nconduct is presumptively expressive.”). Like the illegal\nsexual activity being regulated in Arcara, it is indisputable\nthat Mr. Doe’s urges and actions “manifest[ ] absolutely no\nelement of protected expression,” Arcara, 478 U.S. at 705,\nand the City’s ban “bears absolutely no connection to any\nexpressive activity,” id. at 707 n.3. In Arcara, the Court\npointedly compared the illegal sexual activity at issue in that\ncase to the sort of conduct intimately related to expression\nthat the Court has held to be worthy of protection under the\nFirst Amendment. See id. (citing Grayned v. City of Rockford,\n408 U.S. 104 (1972) (demonstration results in prosecution\nunder antinoise ordinance); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U.S. 501\n(1946) (trespass in order to distribute religious literature);\nCantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940) (breach of peace\nprosecution based upon distribution of religious literature)).\nThe conduct at issue in our case certainly contains no more\nof an expressive element than the activity at issue in Arcara\nand therefore deserves no protection under the First\nAmendment.\n In short, because there is no expression at issue, First\n                                                     7\nAmendment doctrine simply has no application here. In\n\n\n7\n  Even if we were to determine that Mr. Doe’s sexual urges some-\nhow triggered First Amendment scrutiny, they would be excepted\nfrom First Amendment protection under the incitement and ob-\nscenity doctrines. Given the context in which the urges occurred\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f14                                                      No. 01-3624\n\ndeed, we have nothing approaching “expression”; instead, we\nhave predation.\n\n\n                                  2.\n  Mr. Doe further suggests that the City is punishing him\nfor his private thoughts.\n  A government entity no doubt runs afoul of the First\nAmendment when it punishes an individual for pure thought.\nThe Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment pro-\nhibits the government from commanding a citizen to profess\nor disseminate an ideological message contrary to that\ncitizen’s conscience, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 713\n(1977); West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S.\n624, 633-34 (1943), and from screening certain types of\n\n\n7\n  (...continued)\nand the action they precipitated, they were, in a very real sense,\n“directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and\n[were] likely to incite or produce such action.” Brandenburg v.\nOhio, 395 U.S. 444, 447 (1969). Fueled by his urges, and knowing\nof his dangerous propensity, Mr. Doe put himself in a position\nwhere he could have and would have acted to satisfy those\ndesires if the children had been fewer in number or, it appears, if\none of the children had wandered sufficiently away from the\nothers. Furthermore, Mr. Doe’s urges, if they triggered First\nAmendment scrutiny, would be characterized as a form of child\npornography, the possession and distribution of which has been\nheld unprotected by the Supreme Court. See Osborne v. Ohio, 495\nU.S. 103, 109-11 (1990); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756\n(1982). Of course, as we point out in the text, it is quite unrealistic\neven to talk about these doctrines in this case. They assume some\nform of “expression,” broadly defined, to necessitate First\nAmendment scrutiny in the first place; that expression is simply\nmissing here.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  15\n\nstimuli from flowing to a citizen under the guise of mind\ncontrol, see Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 565-66 (1969)\n(“Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of\ngiving government the power to control men’s minds. . . .\nWhatever the power of the state to control public dissemina-\ntion of ideas inimical to the public morality, it cannot\nconstitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of\ncontrolling a person’s private thoughts.”). Closer to this\ncase, the Court also has indicated that the government can-\nnot regulate mere thought, unaccompanied by conduct. See\nParis Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 67-68 (1973) (“The\nfantasies of a drug addict are his own and beyond the reach\nof government, but government regulation of drug sales is\nnot prohibited by the Constitution.”).\n  The Supreme Court, however, has made it clear that only\ngovernmental regulations aimed at mere thought, and not\nthought plus conduct, trigger this principle. That is, reg-\nulations aimed at conduct which have only an incidental\neffect on thought do not violate the First Amendment’s\nfreedom of mind mandate. Id.; Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103,\n109 (1990). Limiting First Amendment protection to pure\nthought is rooted in common-sense. Thought and action are\nintimately entwined; consequently, all regulation of conduct\nhas some impact, albeit indirect, on thought. Cases such as\nParis Adult Theatre I and Osborne simply state what most of\nus probably intuit: The First Amendment’s freedom of mind\nprinciple does not subject every conduct-focused regulation\nto First Amendment scrutiny; rather, it only prohibits those\nregulations aimed at pure thought and thus mind control.\n  In Paris Adult Theatre I, for example, the Supreme Court\nrejected a freedom of thought challenge to a Georgia law\nthat prohibited the display or distribution of obscene ma-\nterials, explaining:\n    It is also argued that the State has no legitimate interest\n    in “control [of] the moral content of a person’s thoughts,”\n\f16                                                    No. 01-3624\n\n     Stanley v. Georgia, [394 U.S. 557, 565 (1969)], and we\n     need not quarrel with this. But we reject the claim that\n     the State of Georgia is here attempting to control the\n     minds or thoughts of those who patronize theaters.\n     Preventing unlimited display or distribution of obscene\n     material, which by definition lacks any serious literary,\n     artistic, political, or scientific value as communication,\n     Miller v. California, [413 U.S. 15, 24, 34 (1973)], is distinct\n     from a control of reason and the intellect. Cf. Kois v.\n     Wisconsin, 408 U.S. 229 (1972); Roth v. United States, [354\n     U.S. 476, 485-87 (1957)]; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88,\n     101-02 (1940); Finnis, “Reason and Passion”: The Constitu-\n     tional Dialectic of Free Speech and Obscenity, 116 U. Pa. L.\n     Rev. 222, 229-30, 241-43 (1967). Where communication of\n     ideas, protected by the First Amendment, is not in-\n     volved, or the particular privacy of the home protected\n     by Stanley, or any of the other “areas or zones” of\n     constitutionally protected privacy, the mere fact that, as\n     a consequence, some human “utterances” or “thoughts”\n     may be incidentally affected does not bar the State from\n     acting to protect legitimate state interests. Cf. Roth v.\n     United States, 354 U.S. at 483, 485-87; Beauharnais v.\n     Illinois, [343 U.S. 250, 256-57 (1952)].\n413 U.S. at 67. Likewise, in Osborne, the Supreme Court\nconsidered the constitutionality of an Ohio ordinance that\nprohibited, with narrow exceptions, the possession or viewing\nof “any material or performance that shows a minor who is\nnot the person’s child or ward in a state of nudity.” 495 U.S.\nat 106 (quoting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2907.323(A)(3)\n(Supp. 1989)). In rejecting Osborne’s First Amendment ar-\nguments, the Court distinguished its freedom of thought\nprecedent: “The difference here is obvious: The State does\nnot rely on a paternalistic interest in regulating Osborne’s\nmind. Rather, Ohio has enacted § 2907.323(A)(3) in order to\nprotect the victims of child pornography; it hopes to destroy\na market for the exploitative use of children.” Id. at 109.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                        17\n\n  Although we can accept in the abstract Mr. Doe’s argu-\nment that a government may not punish pure thought, we\ncannot accept his further submission that, in subjecting him\n                                 8\nto this ban, the City “punished” him for “pure thought.”\n\n\n8\n   It is important to note that the City, in banning Mr. Doe from\nthe parks, was not “punishing” him at all. Rather, the ban was a\ncivil (i.e., nonpunitive) measure designed for the protection of the\npublic. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 105-06 (2003) (finding the\nAlaska sex offender registration statute nonpunitive); see also\nKansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 (1997) (explaining regarding\nHendricks, the challenger of the civil commitment statute at\nissue: “This admitted lack of volitional control, coupled with a\nprediction of future dangerousness, adequately distinguishes\nHendricks from other dangerous persons who are perhaps more\nproperly dealt with exclusively through criminal proceedings”).\nIt is unquestionable that a governmental entity has broader\npowers to operate both substantively and procedurally in the\ncivil, as opposed to criminal (i.e., punitive), context. See generally\nMary M. Cheh, Constitutional Limits on Using Civil Remedies To\nAchieve Criminal Law Objectives: Understanding and Transcending\nthe Criminal-Civil Law Distinction, 42 Hastings L.J. 1325, 1343-44\n(1991) (“The Court has approved such regulatory measures as\npretrial detention, detention during wartime and insurrection,\ndetention of resident aliens pending deportation proceedings,\npost-arrest detention of juveniles, detention of criminal defendants\nwho are incompetent to stand trial, and the involuntary commit-\nment of mentally ill persons who are a danger to themselves or\nto others.” (footnotes omitted)); see also id. at 1331 (noting civil\nand criminal trials “follow different rules of procedure, burdens\nof proof, and rules of discovery”). In fact, this case fairly can be\ncharacterized as a form of “civil exclusion,” and the Supreme\nCourt has held that the Constitution affords latitude to govern-\nments to commit dangerous persons, such as sexual predators, in\norder to protect the public. See Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 357 (uphold-\ning Kansas’ civil commitment statute which permitted detention\n                                                       (continued...)\n\f18                                                     No. 01-3624\n\nThe City has not banned him from having sexual fantasies\nabout children. It did not ban him from the public parks\nbecause he admitted to having sexual fantasies about child-\nren in his home or even in a coffee shop. The inescapable\nreality is that Mr. Doe did not simply entertain thoughts; he\nbrought himself to the brink of committing child molesta-\ntion. He had sexual urges directed toward children, and he\ntook dangerous steps toward gratifying his urges by going\nto a place where he was likely to find children in a vulnera-\nble situation.\n  To characterize the ban as directed at “pure thought”\nwould require us to close our eyes to Mr. Doe’s actions. It\nalso would require that we give short shrift to Mr. Doe’s\ncondition as an admitted pedophile who continues to have\ndifficulty controlling his urges. The law has long recognized\n\n\n8\n  (...continued)\nwhen a person “has been convicted of or charged with a sexually\nviolent offense,” and “suffers from a mental abnormality or\npersonality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in\nthe predatory acts of sexual violence” (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann.\n§ 59-29a02(a) (1994))); see also Kansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407 (2002)\n(elaborating on Hendricks).\n   The fact that the City’s actions are understood appropriately\nnot as “punishment,” but as a civil measure designed to protect\nits youth, renders irrelevant the argument that Mr. Doe’s actions\nwere not of sufficient gravity to justify punishment. The City was\nnot bound to wait until Mr. Doe again committed the crime of\nchild molestation or attempted child molestation in order to act.\nIt had the power to address Mr. Doe’s actions outside the crim-\ninal law context and did exactly that. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 93\n(“[A]n imposition of restrictive measures on sex offenders adjudged\nto be dangerous is a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective\nand has been historically so regarded.” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  19\n\nthat not every individual is equally capable of controlling\nhis desires and preventing them from becoming actions\nwhich injure others. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84, 93 (2003)\n(explaining, in upholding Alaska’s sex offender registration\nstatute, that “an imposition of restrictive measures on sex\noffenders adjudged to be dangerous is a legitimate nonpu-\nnitive governmental objective and has been historically so\nregarded” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\nAs Justice Holmes wrote, “the character of every act de-\npends upon the circumstances in which it is done.” Schenck\nv. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919). Mr. Doe is an admitted\nsexual addict with a proclivity toward children; as such, he\nbelongs to a group of persons who are more susceptible to\nhaving sexual desires with respect to children and to acting\non those urges. We cannot ignore, nor can we say the law\nsomehow commands the City to ignore, Mr. Doe’s pedo-\nphilia and the history of his battle with that affliction.\nFacing this reality certainly does not license society, acting\nthrough government, to exile, harass or marginalize Mr.\nDoe, but it permits government to fulfill its responsibility to\nprotect vulnerable children in dangerous situations.\n   In short, we must recognize the actual situation confront-\ning the City as well as the parents and children who look to\nthat City for protection. The children and their parents are\nnot concerned about Mr. Doe’s thoughts. They are con-\ncerned about his coming to the park to achieve sexual grati-\nfication. They do not need to wait until a child is molested\nto take steps to protect their children. The First Amendment\ndoes not prohibit the City from taking the action it did to\nprotect its children. It does not require the City to act in an\nostrichlike fashion and expose the children of the City to the\nrisk that, on a future date, a child will wander further from\nthe group, present a better opportunity and experience the\ntragic consequences.\n\f20                                                   No. 01-3624\n\nB. Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n   The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides that the state shall not “deprive any person of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const.\namend. XIV. The case law acknowledges two distinct\nstrands of analysis under this Clause. The first—procedural\ndue process—allows the government to deprive a citizen of\n“life, liberty, or property” only in accordance with certain\nprocedural protections. Mr. Doe did not raise this issue in\nthe district court, and he has not raised it in this court. We\ntherefore have no occasion to address this issue and express\nno view with respect to the City’s treatment of Mr. Doe in\nthis regard.\n  Mr. Doe relies exclusively on the other strand of due pro-\ncess analysis: substantive due process. When viewing the\nClause from this perspective, the Supreme Court has empha-\nsized that the appropriate inquiry is not whether governmen-\ntal authorities afforded the individual certain procedural\nprotection. Rather, the inquiry is whether the individual has\nbeen subjected to “the arbitrary exercise of the powers of\ngovernment, unrestrained by the established principles of\nprivate rights and distributive justice.” Bank of Columbia v.\nOkely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235, 244 (1819), quoted in County of\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 845 (1998), and Hurtado v.\n                                      9\nCalifornia, 110 U.S. 516, 527 (1884).\n\n\n9\n   See also Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986) (“This\nhistory reflects the traditional and common-sense notion that the\nDue Process Clause, like its forebear in the Magna Carta, was\nintended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of\nthe powers of government.” (internal quotation marks and cita-\ntions omitted)); Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 558 (1974) (“The\ntouchstone of due process is protection of the individual against\n                                                     (continued...)\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                        21\n\n                                 1.\n   Our first duty is to provide a “careful description” of the\nliberty interest that Mr. Doe seeks to have protected. Washington\nv. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997). Then, we must ask\nwhether that interest is “fundamental,” that is, whether it is\n“objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such\nthat neither liberty nor justice would exist if [it] were\nsacrificed.” Id. at 720-21 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted). In undertaking these inquiries, we must\nremain mindful of the Supreme Court’s admonition that\n    we ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the concept\n    of substantive due process because guideposts for respon-\n    sible decisionmaking in this unchartered area are scarce\n    and open-ended. By extending constitutional protection to\n    an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent,\n    place the matter outside the arena of public debate and\n    legislative action. We must therefore exercise the utmost\n    care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this\n    field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\n    be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the\n    Members of this Court.\n\n\n9\n   (...continued)\narbitrary action of government.”); DeTomaso v.

The difficulty\narises because rights can be characterized in numerous ways,\nand the characterization of a right plausibly can fall at a\nnumber of points along a continuum of generality. These\ndifficulties, however, are constrained by two factors. First,\nand perhaps most obvious, we are constrained by the factual\nrecord before us, which sets the boundaries of the liberty\ninterest truly at issue in the case. Second, the Supreme Court\nhas limited, significantly, the level of generality at which we\nmay define a right. Our “careful description” of the asserted\nright must be one that is specific and concrete, one that\n                                                    10\navoids sweeping abstractions and generalities. See Khan v.\nGallitano, 180 F.3d 829, 833-34 (7th Cir. 1999) (discussing\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722). This specificity is necessary in\n\n\n10\n   This precision in describing the asserted liberty interest is seen\nstarkly in Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997). In Glucksberg,\nthe Court faced a substantive due process challenge to a Wash-\nington statute that prohibited “caus[ing]” or “aid[ing]” a suicide.\n521 U.S. at 705 (quoting Wash. Rev. Code § 9A.36.060(1) (1994)).\nThe challengers to the statute were a group of physicians who\nsought to perform physician-assisted suicide and a group of\npatients who sought their assistance. Id. at 707-08. The Court\nrejected broadly cast characterizations of the liberty interest at\nissue presented by the appellate court, id. at 722 (“right to die”),\nand by the challengers, id. at 722-23 (“liberty to choose how to\ndie,” a right to “control of one’s final days,” “the right to choose\na humane, dignified death” and “the liberty to shape death”).

Dist. of Columbia, 188 F.3d 531, 554\n(D.C. Cir. 1999) (Rogers, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part) (“Courts must carefully define the contested\nright, employing sufficient specificity to ground the right in\na concrete application and sufficient generality to connect\nthe right to its animating principles.”).\n  In the case before us, our inquiry can be forwarded most\neasily by first describing what rights are not at stake. It is\nmuch too broad, and inconsistent with the record, to char-\nacterize Mr. Doe’s liberty interest as involving a generalized\nright to movement. See Johnson v. City of Cincinnati, 310 F.3d\n484, 495 (6th Cir. 2002) (noting that a generalized right to\nfreedom of movement connotes “interstate and international\ntravel components”). The City asserts a narrower version of\nthis concept when it claims that the right at issue is the right\nto intrastate travel, i.e., the right to “travel locally through\npublic spaces and roadways.” Id. However, this perspective,\nwhile more precise, does not reflect accurately the gist of\nMr. Doe’s complaint. Notably, Mr. Doe is not claiming that\nthe ban inhibits his right to travel through parts of the City\nto engage in religious, political, commercial and social\nactivities; rather, he is claiming the ban infringes his right to\nenter into particular types of public facilities and to stay\nthere for certain purposes.\n  Mr. Doe asserts that he seeks a right to enter the parks to\n                                      11\nloiter or for other innocent purposes. Although we could\n\n\n11\n  Mr. Doe submits that the liberty at issue is the “basic right to\nwander and loiter in public parks.” Appellant’s Br. at 16.

See Doe\nAff. ¶ 7. However, according to the record, at least since 1990, he\nhas not entered a City of Lafayette Park except on the January\n2000 evening in question. See Doe Dep. at 30; see also Moisan-\nThomas Dep. at 36 (noting that it is “unlikely” that Mr. Doe\nwould want to take a walk through the park). On this night, he\nwas not simply wandering or loitering or seeking other innocent\nactivities; rather, driven by his sexual appetite for children, he\nwent into a park in search of children to satisfy those desires. To\nthe extent Mr. Doe seeks a right to enter parks to prey on\nchildren, it goes without saying that no such right exists, and,\neven if it did, it would be far from “fundamental.” Cf. City of\nChicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 53 (1999) (plurality) (“[T]he\nfreedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the ‘liberty’ pro-\ntected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”\n(emphasis added)).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                    25\n\n    of Southeastern Pennsylvania v.

We have also assumed, and strongly suggested,\n    that the Due Process Clause protects the traditional\n    right to refuse unwanted lifesaving medical treatment.\n    [Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261\n    (1990)].\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720. It is also helpful to compare Mr.\nDoe’s asserted liberty interest to enter parks to the more\nanalogous right to intrastate travel, which some, but not all\nof our sister circuits, have held “fundamental.” Compare, e.g.,\nJohnson, 310 F.3d at 498 (recognizing as fundamental “the\nright to travel locally through public spaces and roadways”)\nand Ramos v. Town of Vernon, 353 F.3d 171, 176 (2d Cir. 2003)\n(accord), with Wright v. City of Jackson, 506 F.2d 900, 902-03\n(5th Cir. 1975) (rejecting, without extended discussion, a\nfundamental right to intrastate as opposed to interstate\ntravel).\n   These rights, according to the Supreme Court (and in the\ncase of intrastate travel, some of our sister circuits) have a\npowerful historical and precedential pedigree that supports\nthe conclusion that they are “objectively, deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition.” Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at\n720-21; see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967) (“The\nfreedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the\nvital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of hap-\npiness by free men.”). When we compare Mr. Doe’s asserted\nliberty interest with those which have been held fundamental,\nwe are bound to the conclusion that Mr. Doe’s asserted right\nto enter the parks to loiter is not on the same footing; it is\nnot “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that\nneither liberty nor justice would exist if [it] were sacrificed.”\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721. Mr. Doe is not prohibited from\nmaking decisions regarding who he wishes to marry, the\nscope of his family and his relationship with his family\n\f26                                                    No. 01-3624\n\nmembers. Cf. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); Griswold\nv. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316\nU.S. 535 (1942). He is not prohibited from making the\ndecision to end his own life by refusing medical treatment.\nCf. Cruzan v. Dir., Missouri Dep’t of Health, 497 U.S. 261\n(1990). He is not limited in moving from place to place\nwithin his locality to socialize with friends and family, to\nparticipate in gainful employment or to go to the market to\nbuy food and clothing. Cf. Johnson, 310 F.3d at 498 (The right\nto intrastate travel is “an everyday right, a right we depend\non to carry out our daily life activities. It is, at its core, a\n                      12\nright of function.”). By banning Mr. Doe from the parks, the\nCity only has deprived him of the “right” to go the City’s\nparks which he wishes to use for allegedly innocent,\nrecreational purposes. That this right is not “fundamental”\nto Mr. Doe’s personhood is readily apparent not only from\na comparison to other “fundamental” rights, but also from\nthe fact that Mr. Doe has not even entered the City’s parks\nsince at least 1990.\n  The historical and precedential support for a fundamental\nright to enter parks for enjoyment is, to put it mildly,\noblique. Notably, Mr. Doe’s argument contains a dearth of\n\n\n12\n   Even the rights to refuse unwanted medical treatment and to\nintrastate travel, which have much more fundamental implica-\ntions than the right to enter the park to loiter, have not easily\nfound their way into the “fundamental” category. See Glucksberg,\n521 U.S. at 720 (noting that perhaps the right to refuse unwanted\nmedical treatment was held fundamental in Cruzan v. Director,\nMissouri Department of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990)); Hutchins v.\nDist. of Columbia, 188 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (wrestling with the\nquestion of whether the right to intrastate travel is fundamental);\nWright v. City of Jackson, 506 F.2d 900, 902-03 (5th Cir. 1975)\n(rejecting, without extended discussion, a fundamental right to\nintrastate as opposed to interstate travel).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  27\n\nhistorical sources. He cites no case, state or federal, that has\nheld that the right to enter the park to loiter or for other\nenjoyment purposes is “fundamental,” as that term is un-\nderstood in substantive due process doctrine. Mr. Doe’s\nreliance on a handful of vagueness and overbreadth cases,\nsuch as Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 157\nn.1, 164 (1972) (striking down as unconstitutionally vague\na statute that made criminal, among other things, “wander-\ning or strolling around from place to place without any\nlawful purpose or object” and noting “these activities are\nhistorically part of the amenities of life as we have known\nthem”), are simply inapposite. Similarly, we believe that the\nplurality statement in City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41\n(1999), is of no appreciable help. In that statement, Justice\nStevens, joined by Justices Souter and Ginsburg, stated:\n    [T]he freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of\n    the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the\n    Fourteenth Amendment. We have expressly identified\n    this “right to remove from one place to another accord-\n    ing to inclination” as “an attribute of personal liberty”\n    protected by the Constitution. Williams v. Fears, 179 U.S.\n    270, 274 (1900); see also Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405\n    U.S. 156, 164 (1972). Indeed, it is apparent that an\n    individual’s decision to remain in a public place of his\n    choice is as much a part of his liberty as the freedom of\n    movement inside frontiers that is “a part of our heritage,”\n    Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 126 (1958), or the right to\n    move “to whatsoever place one’s own inclination may\n    direct” identified in Blackstone’s Commentaries. 1 W.\n    Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 130\n    (1765).\nId. at 53. As an initial matter, we note that it is not at all\nclear, and indeed, quite improbable, that Justice Stevens\nundertook in this statement any type of fundamental rights\n\f28                                                        No. 01-3624\n           13\nanalysis. This language, while perhaps some support for\nthe general right to intrastate travel, cannot be read as the\n\n\n13\n     As Professors Rotunda and Nowak have explained:\n      In Chicago v. Morales, the Supreme Court invalidated a law\n      that gave a police officer the authority to order individuals\n      to disperse whenever the police officer believed the group of\n      people who were gathered together in a public place involved\n      one or more “street gang” members who were “loitering.”\n      Justice Stevens wrote for six Justices in finding that the law vio-\n      lated due process, because it was so vague that it allowed totally\n      arbitrary and capricious enforcement by police officers. How-\n      ever, the portion of Justice Stevens’s opinion that described the\n      law as restricting “liberty” was joined only by three Justices. The\n      dissenters attacked the majority, and the plurality opinion, for\n      protecting an activity that they believed was not a fundamental\n      constitutional right and was a constitutionally protected liberty\n      interest.\n        The Morales case did not require any fundamental rights\n      analysis. In the portion of his opinion that was written for\n      only three Justices, Justice Stevens noted that the Court was\n      not ruling that the ability to stay on a sidewalk was a funda-\n      mental constitutional right. Justice Stevens did not assert that\n      the judiciary should closely scrutinize government laws\n      regulating how many people could be on a sidewalk or the\n      conditions on which people could walk down sidewalks in\n      public places. Rather, the Stevens opinion, and the concurring\n      Justices, merely found that the government could not make\n      some form of human activity criminal without providing\n      minimally adequate notice to individuals concerning the type\n      of activity that would violate the law. Just as every law must\n      survive the minimal rationality test, every criminal law must\n      provide some notice to individuals concerning the conduct it\n      makes criminal and provide some limitation of police discretion.\n2 Ronald D. Rotunda & John E. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional\nLaw: Substance and Procedure § 15.5, at 52 (3d ed. Supp. 2004).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  29\n\nSupreme Court’s mandating that a right to loiter in all places\ndeemed “public” is a fundamental liberty interest. Substan-\ntive due process analysis is context-specific; this statement\nhardly includes all the contexts of “public” places—for ex-\nample, parks, public schools, jails, libraries, governmental\nadministration buildings—nor does it mandate a fundamen-\ntal liberty interest to loiter in all of them.\n  We also are unpersuaded by Mr. Doe’s reliance on cases\ninvolving the First Amendment public forum doctrine,\nwhich holds that “the rights of the state to limit expressive\nactivity are sharply circumscribed” in “quintessential public\nforums” such as “streets and parks.” Perry Educ. Ass’n v.\nPerry Local Educators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983) (emphasis\nadded). As we have discussed at some length in an earlier\nsection of this opinion, Mr. Doe’s conduct on the January\n2000 night in question does not involve expression, and Mr.\nDoe’s stated reasons for now wanting to enter the park are\nunrelated to expression. See Doe Aff. ¶ 7. Indeed, it is telling\nthat Mr. Doe does not even mention the public forum line of\ncases in his First Amendment argument.\n  In sum, assuming the record would support his conten-\ntion that he is seeking a right to enter public parks simply to\nwander and loiter innocently, we cannot characterize that\nright as “fundamental.”\n\n\n                              2.\n  Because we have concluded that the City’s ban does not\nencroach on a fundamental liberty interest, we are bound to\napply the rational basis standard of review to the City’s ban.\nAccordingly, we must ask whether the ban is “rationally\nrelated to a legitimate government interest, or alternatively\nphrased,” whether the ban is “arbitrary” or “irrational.” Lee\nv. City of Chicago, 330 F.3d 456, 467 (7th Cir. 2003). As Mr.\n\f30                                                 No. 01-3624\n\nDoe concedes, the City’s interest is not merely legitimate, it\nis compelling. See Appellant’s Br. at 20; see also New York v.\nFerber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982) (“It is evident beyond the\nneed for elaboration that a State’s interest in ‘safeguarding\nthe physical and psychological well-being of a minor’ is\n‘compelling.’ ” (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior\nCourt, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982))). Furthermore, the ban of Mr.\nDoe from the City’s parks is rationally related to that end.\nMr. Doe admits that he is a sexual addict who always will\nhave inappropriate urges toward children; his physician\nreadily concedes that sexual addicts like Mr. Doe sometimes\nfall down the slippery slope into abuse; and, in January of\n2000, he started down the slippery slope when he went to\nthe parks in response to those urges and did not act on them\nonly because they were not “realistic” at the time. Add these\nfacts to the reality that children, some of the most vulnera-\nble members of society, are susceptible to abuse in parks,\nand it is hard to see how the City’s ban is anything but\nrational.\n  Indeed, even if we were required to judge the ban under\nthe strict scrutiny standard, we would uphold its validity.\nStrict scrutiny mandates that the governmental regulation\nat issue have a compelling government interest and be nar-\nrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Billings v. Madison\nMetro. Sch. Dist., 259 F.3d 807, 815 (7th Cir. 2001). Again, Mr.\nDoe concedes the compelling nature of the City’s interest in\nprotecting its youth; therefore, the only question is whether the\nban is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The narrow\ntailoring inquiry requires that we ask whether there are\n“other, reasonable ways to achieve th[e] goals with a lesser\nburden on constitutionally protected activity.” Johnson, 310\nF.3d at 503 (quoting Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 343\n(1972)). If there are, the City “may not choose the way of\ngreater interference. If it acts at all, it must choose ‘less\ndrastic means.’ ” Id.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   31\n\n  The City has banned only one child sex offender, Mr. Doe,\nfrom the parks, and they have banned Mr. Doe only because\nof his near-relapse in January of 2000 when he went into the\n                                                  14\npark to engage in psychiatric brinkmanship. Mr. Doe\nargues that the ban could be narrower both geographi-\ncally—limited to certain areas of the park system— and\ntemporally—it could extend for a finite period of time. This\nargument ignores that the only “less drastic means” the City\nmust conform to are those which are “reasonable” means of\nachieving the compelling interest. Id. The City cannot\nreasonably anticipate what parts of the park system children\nwill be located in at all times, and, on this record, we have\nno basis on which to question its judgment that children are\nvulnerable throughout the park system. As to the temporal\nnature of the ban, Mr. Doe concedes that his sexual urges\ntoward children always will be with him, and his behavior\nin January of 2000, coupled with his criminal history,\npresents a compelling case that he is prone to relapse.\nNothing in the record suggests this is likely to subside over\ntime. Accordingly, even assuming that we ought to consider\nthis ban under the strict scrutiny standard, we still would\nhold it was valid as the narrowest reasonable means for the\nCity to advance its compelling interest of protecting its\nchildren from the demonstrable threat of sexual abuse by\nMr. Doe.\n\n\n\n\n14\n  Mr. Doe suggests that his exclusion is irrational because there\nare many convicted sex offenders living in the same geographic\narea who are not banned from the parks. According to this rec-\nord, however, the City does not have knowledge that relapses or\nnear-relapses involving other sex offenders have occurred on city\nproperty. There is certainly nothing in the record to suggest the\nCity would act differently when faced with a similar case.\n\f32                                                No. 01-3624\n\n                         Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, we must reject Mr. Doe’s chal-\nlenges based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments and\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n                                                    AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, with whom ROVNER and DIANE P.\nWOOD, Circuit Judges, join in dissenting. John Doe was\nbanned for life from all park property in the City of Lafay-\nette, Indiana—including a golf course, sports stadium, and\ncity pools. As this ban violates Doe’s First Amendment right\nto freedom of thought by impermissibly punishing him for\nthose thoughts, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n                     I. BACKGROUND\n   Convicted sex offenders, particularly child molesters, are\na reviled group. Child molestation is one of the most\nheinous and deplorable crimes, attacking our most precious\nresource, our children. John Doe is a member of this under-\nstandably vilified group. His criminal history includes convic-\ntions for child molestation, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and\nwindow peeping. His last conviction was in 1991, ten years\nbefore this litigation. Doe’s crimes were committed in\nschools, a convenience store, and outside private residences\n(though none in a park). He admits that his urges are\ntriggered by emotional vulnerability, typically in the late\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                         33\n\nevening. As a result of these criminal convictions, Doe has\nbeen hospitalized, imprisoned, under house arrest, and on\nprobation. He has been in active psychological treatment\nsince 1986, and voluntarily attends group therapy. Doe admits\nhe still has fantasies about children, and his psychologist\nopines that he will likely have these urges for the rest of his\nlife.\n  In January 2000, Doe was driving home from work and\n                                                        1\nstopped at Murdock Park, in the City of Lafayette, and\nwatched five youths in their early teens playing on a base-\nball diamond. Doe admits that, while observing them, he\nthought about having sexual contact with the children. After\nwatching them for 15-30 minutes, and without having any\ncontact with them, Doe left the park. “I said to myself: I’ve\ngot to get out of here before I do something, so I left.” Doe\n           2\nDep. at 27.\n  Once Doe left the park, he sent an emergency page to his\npsychologist’s answering service, which immediately con-\ntacted the doctor. Doe explained what occurred and ex-\n\n\n1\n   The majority points out that Doe came in contact with two\nparks, but his intention in going to the first park, Columbian\nPark, is far from clear. Doe explained in his deposition that he\nlived a short distance from that park, and there is no evidence\nthat he got out of his car or even stopped his car at the first park.\n2\n   Characterizing Doe’s ability to control his urges as “marginal,” the\nmajority seems to focus on Doe’s statements concerning the logistical\ndifficulty of approaching the teenagers on the baseball diamond.\nMajority opinion at 9. However, as the majority concedes and Doe\narticulates, he was able to control himself and leave the park. “While\nwatching the children in Murdock Park in January of 2000 I certainly\nhad sexual thoughts. However, I was not planning to act on my\nthoughts. I recognized that these were just unhealthy thoughts and\nI realized I needed to leave the park, which is what I did.” Doe\nAff. ¶ 5.\n\f34                                                    No. 01-3624\n\npressed that he was upset about the incident. As part of his\ntreatment, his psychologist suggested that he discuss the\nincident with his sexual addicts anonymous (SAA) group,\nwhich was to meet a few days later. The doctor also focused\non the fact that Doe was able to control his urge and leave\n                                                   3\nthe park as a positive step in his rehabilitation. As the\nlongest non-offending member of the SAA group,\nits members were very disappointed by Doe’s disclosure. In\nresponse to this incident, Doe began voluntarily receiving\nweekly shots of Depo-Provera to aid in suppressing his\nurges.\n  An anonymous source reported Doe’s January visit to the\npark, and the thoughts he had while he was there, to Doe’s\nformer probation officer. The probation officer then contacted\nthe Lafayette Police Department, which prompted a conver-\nsation between the Police Chief, the Superintendent of the\nLafayette Parks Department, and a City attorney regarding\nDoe’s appearance in the park. Their discussion focused on\nthe nature of Doe’s January visit to the park and his criminal\nhistory, although all acknowledge that Doe was no longer\n                                        4\nserving a sentence or on probation. As a result of this\nconversation, the City Parks Department issued an order\n\n3\n  Doe’s psychologist explained that “[i]n the first phase of re-\ncovery, our primary goal is to keep the patient as far away from\nany circumstance that might hold a trigger for him.” While, “[i]n\nthe second phase of recovery, we actually encourage the patient\nto begin to determine the boundaries of what’s safe and what’s\nnot safe.” Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 14-15.\n4\n  Doe was not on probation in January 2000 and was not even\nrestricted from entering the park during his period of house\narrest a decade earlier, thus, this analysis will not consider\nwhether the restrictions imposed by the City might have been\nappropriate as a condition of release as part of the earlier criminal\nsentences. Cf. United States v. Schave, 186 F.3d 839, 841 (7th Cir.\n1999).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   35\n\npermanently banning Doe from entering any City park\nproperty at any time and for any purpose under threat of\narrest for trespass. The City did not provide any pre-is-\nsuance review of the ban, nor was Doe afforded an opportu-\n                5\nnity to appeal.\n  The ban order is both geographically and temporally\nbroad. The City of Lafayette’s extensive park system in-\ncludes several large parks, many smaller neighborhood\nparks, a zoo, a golf course, a sports complex, a baseball sta-\ndium, and several pools. Typically, ban orders are issued by\nthe City against those who have vandalized park property\nor interfered with park patrons. The resulting bans ordi-\nnarily are issued for a week or, at most, a summer. In this\n                                                           6\ncase, the ban order against Doe has no termination date.\n\n\n                        II. ANALYSIS\n  Doe’s First Amendment appeal raises several questions\nnot typically before a court. May a city constitutionally ban\none of its citizens from public property based on its discov-\nery of that individual’s immoral thoughts? Is being banned\nfrom public property a “punishment”? Does the First\nAmendment protect a citizen’s right to think about commit-\nting a crime, even if he has committed that crime in the\npast? This scenario is quite unusual, as it is a rare case\nwhere thoughts, as distinct from deeds, become publicly\n\n\n5\n   Although I have grave concerns about the procedural due\nprocess infirmities in the method employed by the City to issue\nthe ban, Doe does not challenge the order on this ground. I con-\ntinue to be intrigued by Doe’s strategic decision to forgo this\nstraightforward claim.\n6\n  As the majority points out, Doe also has not challenged the ban\non the grounds that it is unconstitutionally overbroad. I am also\npuzzled by the omission of this issue from Doe’s discussion.\n\f36                                                No. 01-3624\n\nknown. Most thinking, unless purposefully revealed to\nothers, remains one’s own. Unlike other cases in which the\nstate becomes aware of an individual’s mental state because\nof his or her actions, here the City acknowledges that Doe’s\nown revelation of his thoughts, not any outward expression\ndemonstrating his thinking, is the basis for its actions.\n\n\nA. The First Amendment prohibits government control\n   over a citizen’s thoughts.\n  The freedom of individuals to control their own thoughts\nhas been repeatedly acknowledged by the Supreme Court.\nIn West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,\n642 (1943), the Court upheld a challenge by Jehovah’s\nWitnesses to West Virginia’s requirement that all schoolchil-\ndren participate in a pledge and salute honoring the United\nStates flag. The Court ruled that such an obligation would\nimpermissibly infringe upon “the sphere of intellect and\nspirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to our\nConstitution to reserve from all official control.” Id.\n   Although Barnette’s challenge to the West Virginia enact-\nment was based on religious conviction, id., the guarantee\nof freedom of the intellect has not been limited to beliefs\nconcerning politics or religion. In Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S.\n557 (1969), Stanley was convicted under Georgia law for\npossessing obscene material when pornographic films were\nfound in his home. The Supreme Court reversed Stanley’s\nconviction, finding a right to peruse obscene material in the\nprivacy of one’s home. Id. at 565-66. A central focus of the\nCourt’s discussion was the quintessential principle that the\ngovernment’s power does not extend to control of a person’s\nthoughts: “a State has no business telling a man, sitting\nalone in his own house, what books he may read or what\nfilms he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                      37\n\nrebels at the thought of giving government the power to\ncontrol men’s minds.” Id. at 565. Once again, the Court tied\nthis freedom to fundamental principles of the First Amend-\nment, holding that “it is wholly inconsistent with the\nphilosophy of the First Amendment” for the government to\nexercise “the right to control the moral content of a person’s\n                          7\nthoughts.” Id. at 565-66.\n  The Court has also recognized the intersection of freedom\nof the mind, protected by the First Amendment, with the\nright to privacy. See Griswold, 381 U.S. at 483 (“[T]he First\nAmendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected\nfrom governmental intrusion.”); see also Lawrence v. Texas,\n539 U.S. 558, 558 (2003) (“Liberty protects the person from\nunwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other\nprivate places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent\n\n\n7\n   See also United States v. Reidel, 402 U.S. 351, 355-56 (1971)\n(affirming that Stanley focused on the “freedom of mind and\nthought and on the privacy of one’s home”); Wooley v. Maynard,\n430 U.S. 705, 714-15 (1977) (overturning requirement that license\nplate include phrase “Live Free or Die” under “the proposition\nthat the right of freedom of thought protected by the First\nAmendment against state action includes both the right to speak\nfreely and the right to refrain from speaking at all”); Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 482 (1965) (“The right of freedom of\nspeech and press includes . . . freedom of thought”); United States\nv.

And there are other spheres of our lives and\nexistence, outside the home, where the State should not be\na dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial\nbounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes\nfreedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate\nconduct.”); Claudia Tuchman, Does Privacy Have Four Walls?\nSalvaging Stanley v. Georgia, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 2267, 2282\n(1994) (discussing freedom of thought and reasoning that\n“[f]reedom of mind focuses on the privacy of all personal\nthoughts—the ‘abnormal’ as well as the intellectually\nworthy.”).\n   Indeed, even when an individual’s ideas concern immoral\nthoughts about child pornography, the Court has steadfastly\nmaintained the right to think freely. See Ashcroft v. Free Speech\nCoalition, 535 U.S. 234, 252-53 (2002). In Free Speech Coalition,\nthe Court considered federal legislation that criminalized\nvirtual child pornography, so named because although the\nimages appear to depict minors, they were produced without\nusing real children. Id. at 239. The Court struck down the\nban, finding that Congress could not justify prohibition of the\nconstitutionally-protected speech. Id. at 256. There, the fact that\npossession of virtual child pornography may ignite sexually\nimmoral thoughts about children was not enough to justify\nbanning it. Id. at 252-53. Given the Court’s long-standing rec-\nognition of the freedom of thought, the City of Lafayette’s ban\norder must be analyzed in light of the principle that freedom of\nthe mind occupies a highly-protected position in our con-\nstitutional heritage.\n  The City defends the ban as a measure to protect its youth\nfrom a person with a history of sex offenses whom it fears\nmay harm its children in the future. As part of this argu-\nment, the City and the majority seem to equate a propensity\nto commit crime with an inability to control one’s impulses,\nimplying that Doe’s thoughts about children and close prox-\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   39\n\nimity to them will lead him to strike again. First, propensity\nand volitional capacity are distinct aspects of conduct. See\nKansas v. Crane, 534 U.S. 407, 414 (2002) (recognizing that the\nConstitution does not permit the commitment of a pedophile\nwithout some lack-of-control determination thereby recogniz-\ning the possibility that a pedophile may control his urges).\nFurther, this fear—that an individual’s thoughts may\nencourage action—is not enough to curb protected thinking.\n  The Court in Stanley addressed the line between crime\nprevention and protected speech, stating,\n    we believe that in the context of private consumption of\n    ideas and information we should adhere to the view\n    that ‘[a]mong free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be\n    applied to prevent crime are education and punishment\n    for violations of the law.’\n394 U.S. at 566-67 (emphasis added).\n   Further, in Free Speech Coalition, the government proposed\na similar theory in defense of the ban of virtual child\npornography. 535 U.S. at 253. Attempting to prevent the\npotential indirect harm to children posed by pedophiles,\nCongress reasoned that the virtual pictures may serve to\n“whet” the appetites of pedophiles and may be used to\nconvince a reluctant child to participate in sexual acts. Id. at\n241. In line with its previous stance in Stanley, the Court\nsquarely rejected this theory: “The government ‘cannot con-\nstitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of control-\nling a person’s private thoughts.’ First Amendment freedoms\nare most in danger when the government seeks to control\nthought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end.” Id.\n(quoting Stanley, 394 U.S. at 566). Citing criminal statutes 18\nU.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2251, which prohibit sexual abuse, the\nCourt reasoned that “Congress may pass valid laws to\nprotect children from abuse,” however, “[t]he prospect of\n\f40                                                No. 01-3624\n\ncrime . . . by itself does not justify laws suppressing pro-\ntected speech.” Id. at 245 (emphasis added).\n  The majority aptly points out that while pure thoughts are\nprotected by the First Amendment, non-expressive actions\nare not. First Amendment jurisprudence is fastened upon\nthe critical distinction between thinking and acting on those\nthoughts. See, e.g., Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 253\n(“[T]he Court’s First Amendment cases draw vital distinc-\ntions between words and deeds, between ideas and con-\nduct.”); Reidel, 402 U.S. at 356 (private thoughts or fantasies\nare protected by the First Amendment, but selling or buying\nobscenity in the mail is not protected activity and may be\nproscribed without violating the First Amendment). The\nmajority argues that Doe’s steps of driving to the park and\nwatching children constitute non-expressive conduct. The\nquestion then is whether the First Amendment protects a\ncitizen who goes to a venue and thinks about committing a\ncrime? It is clear on this record, that absent Doe’s thoughts\n(and arguably his status as a pedophile, which I address\nbelow) the City would be uninterested in Doe’s decision to\ngo to the park that fateful day. Moreover, divorcing Doe’s\nthoughts from the City’s decision to ban him also strips the\nCity of its alleged “rational basis” for its decision.\n  Recognizing that no child was directly harmed by Doe’s\ndecision to go to the park, the issue here, like that in Free\nSpeech Coalition, is the scope of the City’s power to curb\nprotected thought under the First Amendment to prevent\ncriminal conduct. In the context of child pornography and\nthe potential for child abuse, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.\n747, 759-60 (1982) and Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110-11\n(1990), reflect the delineation between prohibiting conduct\nwhich actually harms children by making them victims and\nconduct which facilitates criminal conduct. For example, in\nFerber, the Court upheld the prohibition of the distribution\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                         41\n\nand sale of child pornography, even though it did not meet\nthe definition of obscenity under Miller v. California, 413 U.S.\n15 (1973), because of the actual harm suffered by partici-\npants in the making of the child pornography. 458 U.S. at\n759-60. Further explaining this distinction, the Court in\nOsborne allowed the prohibition of purely private possession\nof child pornography based on the fact that it helps facilitate\ncriminal conduct, such as its use in soliciting minors to\nparticipate in sexual acts or whetting the appetites of pedo-\nphiles. 495 U.S. at 110-11. However, the Court also reasoned\nthat the actual harm suffered by participants was a key\ningredient to the constitutionality of the prohibition. Id.\nFinally, in Free Speech Coalition, the Court reaffirmed the\nimportance of this actual harm element by reasoning that\nthe First Amendment is violated when speech which “rec-\nords no crime and creates no victims by its production” is\n                             8\nprohibited. 535 U.S. at 250.\n\n\n\n8\n  The Court’s holding in Free Speech Coalition directly rejects the\nmajority’s puzzling attempt to carve out categories of thought\nthat should be “unprotected” because they might relate to ob-\nscenity or may “incite” unlawful action. Thought is protected\nregardless of its underlying content. See Reidel, 402 U.S. at 356\n(“[Reidel] has no complaints about governmental violations of his\nprivate thoughts or fantasies, but stands squarely on a claimed\nFirst Amendment right to do business in obscenity. . .”). Further-\nmore, the majority’s reliance on Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444\n(1969), for the proposition that Doe’s thoughts are a form of self-\nincitement is equally puzzling. The cases that have referred to\nBrandenburg have all involved the incitement, or the attempted\nincitement to lawlessness of one group or individual by a\ndifferent group or individual. See e.g. Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly,\n533 U.S. 525 (2001); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989);\nN.A.A.C.P. v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886 (1982); Commu-\nnist Party of Indiana v. Whitcomb, 414 U.S. 441 (1974); Eisenstadt v.\nBaird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972).\n\f42                                               No. 01-3624\n\n  The City did not receive any complaints from the children\nin the park, and it does not allege that anyone was affected\nby Doe’s presence there. Presumably, untold numbers of\nLafayette residents wander the City’s parks every day, many\nof them potentially thinking offensive or objectionable\nthoughts. The City has not suggested that it monitors sex\noffenders’ presence in the City parks, and it could not cite\nany other example of an individual banned for mere\npresence in the park. The only factors that differentiate Doe\nfrom others are that the City was apprised of his thoughts\nwhile he was in the park and its knowledge of his past\nconduct.\n   The majority’s reliance on cases such as United States v.\nO’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376 (1968) and Arcara v. Cloud Books,\nInc., 478 U.S. 697, 706 (1986) is unhelpful. These cases focus\non the distinction between mere conduct and expression\nand do not contradict long-standing principles regarding\nprotection of thought. Cf. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at\n253 (“The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and\nspeech must be protected from the government because\nspeech is the beginning of thought.”). Furthermore, the ban\nis not a content-neutral widely applied general ordinance,\nwhich incidentally affects a narrow form of expressive con-\nduct, as was the case in O’Brien and Clark v. Community for\nCreative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288 (1984). Rather, the City\nseeks to prohibit Doe from entering its park facilities based\non his thoughts, which, as stated above, are the bedrock of\nexpression. Finally, this situation is distinguishable from\nArcara. In Arcara, the Court found that the First Amendment\ndid not preclude the closing of a bookstore when it was undis-\nputed that solicitation of prostitution and other sexual acts\nwere being performed by patrons in the store. See id. at 705\n(“[W]e underscored the fallacy of seeking to use the First\nAmendment as a cloak for obviously unlawful public sexual\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                    43\n\nconduct. . .”). Therefore, he is not seeking to use the First\nAmendment to cloak unlawful conduct as no such unlawful\nconduct occurred.\n\n\nB. The ban imposed on Doe is a punishment.\n  The majority characterizes the ban as a form of “civil\nexclusion,” majority opinion at n. 8, and brushes aside the\nargument that the ban is punitive in nature. However, it is\nclear from the record that the City seeks to punish Doe by\nbanning him from public park facilities based on the City’s\ndiscovery of his fantasies.\n  When determining whether a governmental action consti-\ntutes a punishment, courts review such factors as:\n    [W]hether a sanction involves an affirmative restraint,\n    how history has regarded it, whether it applies to behavior\n    already a crime, the need for a finding of scienter, its rela-\n    tionship to a traditional aim of punishment, the presence\n    of a nonpunitive alternative purpose, and whether it is\n    excessive in relation to that purpose.\nKansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 394 (1997) (Breyer, J. dis-\nsenting) (citing Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 144,\n169 (1963)) (finding that Kansas’s involuntary commitment\nof a mentally ill sexually dangerous offender is a civil rather\nthan criminal sanction). Courts may also look to the State’s\narticulated purpose behind the measure. See Smith v. Doe, 538\nU.S. 84, 93 (2003) (characterizing the forced registration of\nsex offenders with the Department of Corrections as a civil\nsanction). For example, in In the Matter of Ruffalo, 390 U.S.\n544, 550 (1968), the Court found that “[d]isbarment, de-\nsigned to protect the public, is a punishment or penalty\nimposed on the lawyer.” Similarly, in Specht v. Patterson, 386\nU.S. 605, 608-09 (1967), the Court found that Colorado’s Sex\nOffender’s Act served to punish, “even though it is de-\n\f44                                                  No. 01-3624\n\nsigned not so much as retribution as it is to keep individuals\nfrom inflicting future harm.” Both cases focus on the\nimportance of fair notice and due process.\n  This ban unquestionably imposes an affirmative restraint\non Doe’s liberty of movement. SeeYoungberg v. Romeo, 457\nU.S. 307, 316 (1982) (discussing the “freedom of movement”\nand citing Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 18\n(1979), for the proposition that “[l]iberty from bodily re-\nstraint always has been recognized as the core of the liberty\nprotected by the Due Process Clause from arbitrary govern-\nmental action.”). In its attempt to characterize the City’s action\nas “nonpunitive,” the majority cites Smith for the proposition\nthat the Constitution permits the “imposition of restrictive\nmeasures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous.” 538\nU.S. at 93. Majority opinion at n.8. However, this quote fails\nto tell the full story. The Court went on to affirm the con-\nstitutionality of Alaska’s sex offender registry because it\n“does not restrain activities sex offenders may pursue,” id.\nat 100, and the “dissemination of truthful information in\nfurtherance of a legitimate governmental objective” is not\npunishment, id. at 98. In contrast, Lafayette’s ban expressly\nprohibits Doe from entering any property deemed a part of\nthe Lafayette Park system, which encompasses far more\nthan its parks. Far from merely giving the public truthful\ninformation, this ban affirmatively restricts Doe’s freedom\nof movement. The City’s action is reminiscent of a partial\nbanishment, which serves to expel Doe from certain por-\ntions of City property, see id. at 98 (discussing banishment\nas a measure historically recognized as a punishment), and\ntherefore is not akin to a duty to register.\n  Perhaps most telling is the ban’s relationship to the tra-\nditional aims of punishment. See Stephen B. Reed, The\nDemise of Ozzie and Harriet: Effective Punishment of Domestic\nAbusers, 17 New Eng. J. on Crim. & Civ. Confinement 337,\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  45\n\n358-63 (1991) (discussing the traditional aims of punishment as\ndeterrence, incapacitation, retribution, and rehabilitation).\nSpecifically, the ban serves the twin goals of deterrence,\nwhich are to prevent an individual from repeating conduct\nas well as preventing similar acts by others. See id. at 358-59.\nNews of Doe’s ban will surely serve to warn others in his\nposition that they too may be restricted from entering\nportions of Lafayette if the City is apprised of their immoral\nthoughts. (The ban also serves to deter sex offenders from\nseeking treatment, but I will address that issue later.)\n  Further, the ban segregates Doe from the community and\nsets him apart from the general population. This form of\nsegregation is similar to a condition of probation or super-\nvised release. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 101 (“Probation and\nsupervised release entail a series of mandatory conditions\nand allow the supervising officer to seek the revocation of\nprobation or release in case of infraction.”); Schave, 186 F.3d\nat 841 (preventing a convicted explosives dealer from “as-\nsociating with organizations that, or members who, espouse\nviolence or the supremacy of the white race”). Here, the City\nhas set out a mandatory restriction and should Doe set foot\nin a City park facility he may be prosecuted for trespass. See\nUnited States v. Holm, 326 F.3d 872, 878 (2003) (“to the extent\nthat the condition [of supervised release] is intended to be\na total ban on Internet use, it sweeps more broadly and\nimposes a greater deprivation on Holm’s liberty than is neces-\nsary. . .”) (emphasis added).\n  The ban is also excessive in relation to its stated purpose\nas it contains no termination date. Critical to the analysis in\nHendricks, was the Court’s determination that the petitioner\nwould be confined only so long as he remained a danger to\nhimself or to the public. 521 U.S. at 363. The Court also\nnoted that the duration of confinement was only “poten-\ntially” indefinite. Id. We have no such safeguards here. Doe\n\f46                                                No. 01-3624\n\nhas been banned for life, with no prospect of review or\nreconsideration by the City.\n   I recognize that Doe is not challenging the ban on pro-\ncedural grounds, see n. 5, infra, however, the utter lack of\npre-application procedure and post-application review is\ncritical to the question of whether the ban is punitive. Both\nHendricks and Smith relied on the imposition of sanctions\nafter constitutionally appropriate procedures to protect against\npotential arbitrary government action. See Hendricks, 521\nU.S. at 357 (“We have consistently upheld such involuntary\ncommitment statutes provided the confinement takes place\npursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.”);\nSmith, 538 U.S. at 84 (registration only mandated for those\npreviously convicted of a sexual offense). One could argue\nthat these cases are inapposite based on this difference\nalone. The lack of such procedural safeguards, i.e., periodic\nreview of the necessity of the ban, any procedure to test the\naccuracy of the information used by the City as its basis for\naction, and the lack of any connection to Doe’s ability to\ncontrol his urges, serves to highlight the City’s actual mo-\ntivation.\n  Finally, the fact that the anonymous caller contacted Doe’s\nformer probation officer, who then in turn contacted the\npolice department (criminal units) who then contacted the\nsuperintendent of parks and the city attorney further under-\nscores the City’s intention to punish rather than civilly\nsanction. The resulting ban order is a judicially enforceable\ncriminal decree which punished Doe for his thoughts. See\nHill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 713 (2000) (quoting Madsen v.\nWomen’s Health Center, 512 U.S. 735, 764 (1994) (reasoning\nthat a judicial decree poses a “greater risk of censorship and\ndiscriminatory application than do general ordinances.”)).\n  Having found that the ban is in fact punitive, the maxim\ncogitationis poenam nemo patitur (no one is punishable solely\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                     47\n\nfor his thoughts) is particularly apt. This maxim serves as a\ncornerstone of the criminal justice system and has shaped\n                                                            9\nmany of the constitutional boundaries of criminal law.\nPerhaps the Victorian legal scholar James Fitzjames Stephen\nbest explained this basic limit on government power: “If it\nwere not so restricted it would be utterly intolerable; all\nmankind would be criminals, and most of their lives would\nbe passed trying and punishing each other for offenses\nwhich could never be proved.” 1 James Fitzjames Stephen,\nA History of the Criminal Law of England 78 (1883).\n\n\nC. A citizen may not be punished based on his status.\n  My conclusion is buttressed by a fundamental understanding\nof the bounds of punishable conduct. This axiomatic\nprinciple is illustrated by the distinction between punish-\nment for a person’s status—impermissible under the Eighth\nAmendment—and sanctions levied for a person’s conduct.\nSee Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 666 (1962). In Robin-\nson, the Supreme Court struck down a California statute that\nmade addiction to narcotics illegal. Id. at 666-67. Because the\nstatute required no illegal act, but criminalized mere status\nas a drug addict, it violated the Eighth Amendment’s\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 667.\n\n\n9\n  The proscription against penalizing for ideas alone has been\nrecognized for centuries, see 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on\nLaws of England, 21 (1765) (“[N]o temporal tribunal can search\nthe heart or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as\nthey are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot\npunish for what it cannot know.”), and is reflected in modern\ncodifications of the common law, see Model Penal Code and\nCommentaries, Comment to § 2.01 at 214-15 (1985) (“It is\nfundamental that a civilized society does not punish for thoughts\nalone.”).\n\f48                                                No. 01-3624\n\nThis distinction was further refined in Powell v. Texas, 392\nU.S. 514, 532-34 (1968), where the Court explained that\nalthough status may not be criminalized, acts undertaken as\na result of that status may be. There, the Court upheld\nPowell’s arrest for appearing drunk in public because the\nTexas law did not sanction Powell merely for his status as\nan alcoholic, but for his act of overimbibing in public. Id. at\n535-36. The Court rested its holding on the fact that Powell\nvoluntarily committed sanctionable conduct: “The entire\nthrust of Robinson’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be\ninflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has\nengaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in\npreventing, or perhaps in historical common law terms, has\ncommitted some actus reus.” Id. at 533. See also United States\nv. Black, 116 F.3d 198, 200-01 (7th Cir. 1997) (conviction for\ndistribution, receipt, and possession of child pornography\ndid not violate the Eighth Amendment despite plaintiff’s\ncontention of his status as a pedophile).\n  Doe’s going to the park does not rise to the level of an\n“action” of sufficient gravity to justify punishment. The error\nin punishing actions similar to Doe’s is more easily seen by\nway of analogies removed from the sensitive context of\nchild molestation. By way of comparison, courts would not\nsanction criminal punishment of an individual with a crim-\ninal history of bank robbery (a crime, like child molestation,\nwith a high rate of recidivism, United States v. Pirovolos, 844\nF.2d 415, 416 n.1 (7th Cir. 1988)) simply because she or he\nstood in the parking lot of a bank and thought about rob-\nbing it. It goes without saying that in this hypothetical the\nindividual has not taken an action that could support pun-\nishment. Or, as a different example, punishing a drug addict\nwho stands outside a dealer’s house craving a hit but suc-\ncessfully resists the urge to enter and purchase drugs would\nbe offensive to our understanding of the bounds of the\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   49\n\ncriminal law. See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49,\n67-68 (1973) (“The fantasies of a drug addict are his own\nand beyond the reach of government, but government\nregulation of drug sales is not prohibited by the Constitu-\ntion.”) Despite the City’s arguments to the contrary, both of\nthese situations, analogous to the actions taken by Doe here,\npresent clear examples of actions that do not reach a level of\ncriminal culpability necessary to justify punishment.\n  As these illustrations suggest, Doe’s behavior may also be\nunderstood as the kind that does not come close to what is\nrecognized as punishable under the theory of attempt.\nUnder Indiana law, a person commits attempt when, acting\nwith culpability necessary to commit the crime, he or she\n“engages in conduct that constitutes a substantial step toward\ncommission of the crime.” Ind. Code § 35-41-5-1. Here, the\nmost that can be said of Doe’s action is that he drove to the\npark and watched children. Even if it is assumed that Doe\nintended to molest children when he stood in the park,\nDoe’s mere presence in the park is not enough to constitute\na “substantial step” towards an attempted sex offense. See\nState v. Kemp, 753 N.E. 2d 47, 51 (Ind. Ct. App. 2001) (affirming\ndismissal of attempted child molestation charge when\ndefendant allegedly agreed to meet minor at restaurant parking\nlot, drove there, and brought condoms because conviction\nwould result in “no limit on the reach of ‘attempt’ crimes”).\nIn the same way that the individual with a history of rob-\nbing banks could not be charged with attempted bank robbery\nfor standing across the street from the bank and thinking\nabout robbing it, Doe may not be punished for merely\nthinking perverted thoughts about children.\n  Finally, Doe’s conduct is not akin to stalking, which, while\nperhaps motivated by thoughts, requires actual threatening\nconduct by the stalker. Stalking statutes typically require\nthat a defendant: (1) knowingly or intentionally; (2) engage\n\f50                                                     No. 01-3624\n\nin a course of conduct involving continuous or repeated\nharassment; (3) that would cause a reasonable person to feel\nterrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened; and (4)\nactually causes that person to feel terrorized, frightened, in-\ntimidated, or threatened. See, e.g., Ind. Code § 35-45-10-1.\nDoe’s actions do not come close to criminal conduct pun-\nishable as stalking. He did not “continually” or “repeatedly”\ngo to the public park; his ban order was based on a single\nvisit. See Landis v. State, 704 N.E.2d 113, 113 (Ind. 1998)\n(holding that “the crime of stalking by its nature necessitates\nproof of repeated or continuing acts”). Nor did Doe’s gaze\nor proximity cause any specific person to feel frightened or\nthreatened; indeed, there is no evidence that anyone even\nnoticed Doe’s presence. Frazier v. Delco Elecs. Corp., 263 F.3d\n663, 668 (7th Cir. 2001) (“The stalking victim who doesn’t\nknow that she is being stalked is not in fear of being in-\njured.”). Most importantly, Doe’s conduct—going to a\npublic park with improper thoughts about children previ-\nously unknown to him—did not harm any of the youths in\nthe park, unlike the terror caused by actions criminalized as\n          10\nstalking.\n\n\n\n\n10\n   See, e.g., Garza v. State, 736 N.E.2d 323, 325 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000)\n(despite several requests to be left alone, stalker repeatedly con-\ntacted victim, sent her flowers with a message that began “hate, an-\nger, bitterness, malice, venom, hellish prisons of our own making,”\nand joined her health club); Johnson v. State, 721 N.E.2d 327, 330\n(Ind. Ct. App. 2000) (stalker threatened to kill former girlfriend,\nflattened her car tires, and came to her home on many occasions,\nincluding three separate times the night he was arrested); Waldon\nv. State, 684 N.E.2d 206, 207 (Ind. Ct. App. 1997) (despite exis-\ntence of restraining order, victim encountered stalker on at least\nsix separate occasions near her dance studio within one-year\nperiod).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                    51\n\n                     III. CONCLUSION\n   In the City’s haste to take action to protect its children, an\nadmirable goal, both the majority and the City fail to ap-\nprehend the possible secondary effects of this ban on the\nvery safety it seeks to ensure. As a society grappling with\nthe problem of pedophilia, see Crane, 534 U.S. at 414 (requiring\nsome lack-of-control determination in the civil commitment\nof convicted pedophile), we have limited resources in our\narsenal to address the possibility that someone like Doe may\nreoffend. Once released back into our society, a former sex\noffender must feel free to seek therapy and must be sup-\nported in his efforts to control his urges rather than penal-\nized. Why deter former sex offenders from one of the few\ntreatments available? The importance of therapy cannot be\nunderstated. See 51 Am. Jur. 3d § 5 (“the group (led by the\ntherapist) works on each member’s issues, such as denial,\nguilt, the offender’s own sexual trauma, or lack of empathy\nfor the victim. This is a common technique for outpatient\ntreatment of sex offenders (often a condition of probation).\n. .”). The First Amendment’s concern with freedom of\nthought as a basis for the freedom of expression is high-\nlighted by the facts of this case. The chilling effect of this\nruling, i.e., that the communication of one’s thoughts may\nresult in being banned from public spaces, is frightening. See\nHodgkins v. Peterson, 355 F.3d 1048, 1056 (7th Cir. 2004)\n(“The Supreme Court has often noted that a realistic threat\nof arrest is enough to chill First Amendment rights.”). To\noversimplify the issue, as one of location or logistics (i.e., the\nargument that Doe can simply think elsewhere) fails to\naddress the problem of chilled speech, or here thought, that\nthe First Amendment seeks to secure.\n  One cannot be a thinking member of society and not be\nacutely aware of the critical problem of sex offenses against\nchildren. The substance of Doe’s sexual fantasies about\n\f52                                                    No. 01-3624\n\nchildren are repugnant and deplorable. Doe himself admits\nthat. But, of course, the fact that this court or the City of\nLafayette finds Doe’s thoughts offensive does not limit the\namount of First Amendment protection they are afforded.\nSee Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 245 (“It is also well\nestablished that speech may not be prohibited because it con-\ncerns subjects offending our sensibilities.”); Am. Booksellers\nAssoc. v. Hudnut, 771 F.2d 323, 327 (7th Cir. 1985) (“Under\nthe First Amendment the government must leave to the\npeople the evaluation of ideas.”); Collin v. Smith, 578 F.2d\n1197, 1200 (7th Cir. 1978) (noting that the First Amendment\ncovers protected speech even though it may be “repugnant\nto the core values held generally by residents of this country”).\nDespite our repudiation of the content of his thoughts, the\nCity of Lafayette may not punish Doe for his thinking alone,\nfor without protection from government intrusion into our\nthoughts, the freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment\n                            11\nare virtually meaningless.\n\n\n\n\n11\n  The majority also addresses Doe’s argument that the ban order\nviolates a constitutionally-protected freedom to loiter. Cf. City of\nChicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 53 (1999) (plurality opinion)\n(remarking that the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is\nprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment). As I find the ban order violative of Doe’s First Amend-\nment right to freedom of thought, I find it unnecessary to reach\nthis issue and express no view on the question.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                            53\n\nA true Copy:\n       Teste:\n                      _____________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                USCA-02-C-0072—7-30-04\n\f",

In February of 2000, the City of\nLafayette, Indiana, issued John Doe, a convicted sex offender,\na letter, informing him that he was banned from all public\nparks under the City’s jurisdiction. In November of 2000,\nMr. Doe initiated this action, alleging that the ban violated\nhis rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\nthe Constitution of the United States. The United States\n\f2                                               No. 01-3624\n\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Indiana granted\nsummary judgment to the City. For the reasons set forth in\nthe following opinion, we now affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\n\n                             I\n                     BACKGROUND\nA. Facts\n  John Doe has a long history of arrests and convictions for\nsexually related crimes. In most of these instances, children\nwere the victims. His criminal history includes convictions\nfor child molestation, attempted child molestation, voyeur-\nism, exhibitionism and peeping. These crimes date back to\n1978, when Mr. Doe went into a locker room at a local\nschool, pulled down the swimsuit of a ten-year-old boy and\nperformed oral sex on him. The next year, Mr. Doe forcibly\nperformed oral sex on a twelve-year-old boy. He approached\nthe boy in the parking lot of a local school and asked the\nboy to unzip his pants; after the boy refused, Mr. Doe un-\nzipped the boy’s pants and performed oral sex on him. In\n1985, Mr. Doe admitted to peeping into windows of an\napartment of a female at 1:20 a.m. In 1986, Mr. Doe admitted\nto masturbating in full view of three children who lived in\nthe home next door. During questioning on this incident,\nthe police also asked Mr. Doe if he recalled “masturbating\non the back porch with one of the next door neighbor child-\nren and another friend out in the back yard.” Reed Aff.\nEx.D. Mr. Doe answered: “That’s possible.” Id. In May of\n1988, Mr. Doe was arrested for peeping into the windows of\nan apartment in West Lafayette. In October of 1988, he\nadmitted to standing outside a house, looking through a\nwindow at what he perceived to be a teenage boy and\nmasturbating with his penis exposed. He also admitted this\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  3\n\nbehavior occurred on a number of previous occasions in\nthen-recent history. Mr. Doe explained to police: “[I]t’s\nhappened times before, you know that. I’ve told you this\nbefore I’m still seeing a therapist and working on it, but\nI . . . . I can’t make any excuses. I mean ahh it just happens.\nAhh.” Reed Aff. Ex.F. In May of 1990, Mr. Doe was arrested\nfor public intoxication and resisting law enforcement\nfollowing a report that he was tapping on the rear window\nof a female’s house. In October of 1990, Mr. Doe whistled to\nthree teenage boys—ages ten, fourteen and fifteen—and\nmotioned for them to come into an alley near the Village\nPantry. See Reed Aff. ¶ 4(h). He asked the boys if they wanted\nto receive oral sex, and he also unzipped his pants. The\nthree boys fled the area. This incident resulted in Mr. Doe’s\nlast conviction, which was finalized in 1991. Mr. Doe was\nplaced on house arrest from January of 1992 to January of\n1996. See Doe Dep. at 17. He then was on probation until\nearly January of 2000. See id.\n  We now come to the incident that precipitated the situ-\nation before us. In January of 2000, Mr. Doe’s probation\nofficer, Joe Hooker, received a call from a “confidential\nsource,” informing Officer Hooker that Mr. Doe “had been\n‘cruising’ parks and watching young children.” Reed Dep.\nEx.1. The anonymous caller recounted an incident that oc-\ncurred earlier that January. Mr. Doe’s own description of\nthis episode, in his deposition, vividly describes what took\nplace:\n    A. Well, I parked my car at Parkside Pharmacy across\n       from Murdock Park. I saw three males and two fe-\n       males on the ball diamond there at Murdock Park.\n    Q. Kids?\n    A. Possibly early to mid teens, so yeah, they were under-\n       age. I walked over to the ball diamond. By the time I\n\f4                                                    No. 01-3624\n\n          got over there, they were behind the—there’s a drop-\n          off, a valley or whatever down behind the ball dia-\n          mond that leads over to Ferry Street, I believe. They\n          were down in that area, and I stood there and\n          watched them for a while, probably 15 minutes,\n          maybe a half-hour, I said to myself: I’ve got to get out\n          of here before I do something, I left.\n    ...\n    Q. What was your purpose in going to Murdock Park\n       that Saturday evening?\n    A. Well, as I was going home that night, instead of going\n       my usual route, I took a side street, and one side street\n       led to another, led to another, led to another, and\n       before I knew it, I was at Columbian Park, and so then\n       I decided just to go over to Murdock Park. I don’t\n       know. I guess I was, for whatever reason, I was in the\n       mood of cruising.\n    Q. What do you mean by “cruising”?\n    A. Just looking to see what’s there.\n    Q. Looking for children?\n    A. Mostly, yeah.\n    Q. Were you having those urges that night?\n    A. Yeah, you could probably say that, yeah, yes.\n    Q. When you got out of the car and walked into\n       Murdock Park, what were you thinking about?\n    ...\n    A. When I saw the three, the four kids there, my thoughts\n       were thoughts I had before when I see children, pos-\n       sibly expose myself to them, I thought about the pos-\n       sibility of, you know, having some kind of sexual\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   5\n\n        contact with the kids, but I know with four kids there,\n        that’s pretty difficult to do. It’s a wide open area.\n        Those thoughts were there, but they, you know,\n        weren’t realistic at the time. They were just thoughts.\nDoe Dep. at 27-29.\n  Officer Hooker forwarded the information from the anon-\nymous caller to the Lafayette Police Department. Robert\nReed, Lafayette’s Police Chief, was aware of Mr. Doe’s\ncriminal history, and he initiated discussions with various\nofficials regarding the appropriate response. He contacted\nVicki Mayes, Superintendent of the Lafayette Parks and\nRecreation Department, and Dr. Ed Eiler, Superintendent of\nthe Lafayette School Corporation, and advised them to issue\na ban ordering Mr. Doe not to enter the City’s public parks\nor schools. Chief Reed explained that he gave this advice\n“because of the duty I have to protect the citizens, and\nspecifically the children of this community, from the im-\nminent danger posed by John Doe.” Reed Aff. ¶ 5.\n  On February 2, 2000, Superintendent Mayes sent a letter\nto Mr. Doe informing him that he was prohibited from en-\n                        1\ntering the City’s parks, and, on February 3, 2000, Dr. Eiler\nsent Mr. Doe a letter informing him that he was prohibited\nfrom coming on school grounds. Neither of the bans, which\nare still in effect, have a termination date nor are they\nlimited to certain geographical areas within the public prop-\n\n\n1\n  The City has a variety of parks, some large and some small,\nsome in neighborhoods and some not, some developed and some\nundeveloped. Within the parks are numerous traditional play-\nground areas, softball fields, swimming pools, a zoo and a golf\ncourse. The City’s park system also hosts a range of activities,\nincluding birthday parties, family reunions and an annual Easter\negg hunt. See Mayes Dep. at 4-10.\n\f6                                                    No. 01-3624\n\nerty at issue. In this case, Mr. Doe challenges only the ban from\nthe public parks, and not the public schools. He claims that he\nwould like to go to the parks to play softball, watch the Colt\n                2\nWorld Series, attend a company outing if one takes place at\none of the City’s parks and take walks with friends. See Doe\nAff. ¶ 7. However, Mr. Doe also testified that, other than the\nJanuary 2000 evening in question, he has not been in a city\npark since his 1990 arrest. See Doe Dep. at 30.\n  Mr. Doe is currently continuing therapy under the super-\nvision of Dr. Patricia C. Moisan-Thomas. From 1986 until his\n1990 arrest, he saw Dr. Moisan-Thomas “off and on . . .\nprobably maybe once a month.” Doe Dep. at 31. From 1990\nto present, he has seen her “pretty much on a weekly basis.”\nId. Mr. Doe also currently attends a self-help group for sex-\nual addicts, and, at some point after January of 2000, he\nvoluntarily began taking medications to control his sexual\nurges. See Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 20. Mr. Doe and Dr.\nMoisan-Thomas both testified that “Mr. Doe, like any other\naddict, does not have control over his thoughts” and that he\n“will always have inappropriate thoughts.” Moisan-Thomas\nAff. ¶ 9; Doe Aff. ¶ 6 (“I recognize that I will always have\ninappropriate thoughts regarding having sexual contact with\nchildren.”). Mr. Doe and Dr. Moisan-Thomas also believe that,\nin the last ten years, he has learned how to resist these\ninappropriate urges. Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 27, 33-34; Doe\nAff. ¶ 6. In this regard, Dr. Moisan-Thomas opined that the\nJanuary incident in the park was a “good thing,” at least for\nMr. Doe, because “[i]t gave him the opportunity to use his\nrelapse prevention program and to learn about his limits.”\nMoisan-Thomas Dep. at 27-28. Still, Dr. Moisan-Thomas\nreadily concedes that she can give “absolutely no[ ]” guar-\n\n\n2\n   According to the record, “Colt” is a baseball “league of young\nfifteen, sixteen, [and] seventeen-year-old males.” Mayes Dep. at 6.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                 7\n\nantee that Mr. Doe will not reoffend, and, when asked if\nsexual addicts, such as Mr. Doe, “do fall down that slippery\nslope sometimes,” Dr. Moisan-Thomas responded: “Some-\ntimes they do.” Id. at 35.\n\n\nB. District Court Proceedings\n  On September 14, 2001, the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Indiana granted summary judg-\nment to the City on Mr. Doe’s claims under the First and\nFourteenth Amendments. See Doe v. City of Lafayette, 160 F.\nSupp. 2d 996 (N.D. Ind. 2001).\n\n\n                1. First Amendment Claim\n   The district court began by noting that “[o]rdinarily, in\norder for a violation of the First Amendment to occur, there\nfirst must be some form of expressive speech or conduct\nthat is intended to convey a message.” Id. at 1000. However,\nthe court held, Mr. Doe had not articulated any form of\nexpressive conduct which was impinged by his ban from\nthe City’s parks. Furthermore, the district court rejected Mr.\nDoe’s contention that his right to freedom of thought was\ninfringed because he was being punished merely for inap-\npropriate thoughts. “[N]ot only did he have these thoughts,”\nthe court explained, “but . . . he acted upon them by going\nto the Park and actively seeking out the children.” Id. at\n1001. The court concluded by holding that, to the extent the\nban had any impact on Mr. Doe’s thoughts, that impact was\nincidental, and a mere incidental impact upon a citizen’s\nthoughts does not bar a municipality from advancing a\nlegitimate governmental interest, such as protection of its\nyouth. See id. at 1000-01 (discussing Paris Adult Theatre I v.\nSlaton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108839\"><a href=\"/opinion/108839/paris-adult-theatre-i-v-slaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1973) (“[T]he mere fact that, as a\n\f8                                                     No. 01-3624\n\nconsequence, some human ‘utterances’ or ‘thoughts’ may be\nincidentally affected does not bar the State from acting to\nprotect legitimate state interests.”)). Accordingly, the court\nheld that the ban did not infringe any of Mr. Doe’s First\nAmendment rights.\n\n\n             2. Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n   The district court began by framing Mr. Doe’s Fourteenth\nAmendment substantive due process claim as follows: “Doe\nclaims that the ban order violates his alleged fundamental\nright to enjoy and wander through a public park.” Id. at\n1001. The court noted that a plurality of the Supreme Court\nin City of Chicago v. Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118299\"><a href=\"/opinion/118299/chicago-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999), stated:\n“[F]reedom to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the\n‘liberty’ protected by the Due Process Clause.” Id. at 53.\nHowever, the district court held Morales inapplicable to this\ncase because Mr. Doe’s “purposes” for going in the park\n                        3\nwere not “innocent.” City of Lafayette, 160 F. Supp. 2d at\n1002. The district court also considered Morales inapplicable\nbecause it “was decided primarily on grounds of over\nbreadth and vagueness,” and the court found those issues\nwere not implicated in this case. Id. Apart from Morales, the\ncourt also rejected the notion that there was a broader fun-\ndamental right to intrastate travel or freedom of movement\n\n\n3\n  The district court noted that Mr. Doe submitted several “in-\nnocent” activities for which he would like to enter the parks, such\nas softball. “However,” the court explained, “Doe has not used\nthe city’s park system for such normal innocent purposes within\nthe previous ten years, rather his only visit to the park was in\nresponse to his sexual urge to watch innocent children play in the\npark and act in some criminal or inappropriate manner with\nthose children.” Doe v. City of Lafayette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2578405\"><a href=\"/opinion/2578405/doe-v-city-of-lafayette-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002\n(N.D. Ind. 2001).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                       9\n\nimplicated by the ban. Id. at 1003 (discussing, among other\ncases, Thompson v. Ashe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773279\"><a href=\"/opinion/773279/albert-thompson-v-victor-ashe-mayor-of-the-city-of-knoxville-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406-07 (6th Cir. 2001)).\n  Because it had determined that Mr. Doe’s substantive due\nprocess claim did not implicate a fundamental right, the\ndistrict court then considered the ban under a rational basis\nstandard. It concluded that the City had a strong and\nlegitimate interest in protecting its youth. It further con-\ncluded that the ban was “narrowly tailored to the specific\nfacts and circumstances involving Doe and therefore ad-\nvances the legitimate goals of the city.” Id. at 1004. There-\nfore, the court held, the ban did not violate Mr. Doe’s right\nto substantive due process.\n\n\n                                II\n                         DISCUSSION\n  Mr. Doe, by his own admission, is a sexual addict with a\nproclivity toward children. He always will have sexual urges\ntoward children; the only question is whether he can control\nthem. On the January 2000 evening in question, his control\nwas, charitably stated, marginal. He was having sexual urges\ntoward children; he went “cruising” in the parks in search of\nchildren; he saw children at Murdock Park; he got out of his\ncar and he “thought about the possibility of, you know,\nhaving some kind of sexual contact with the kids.” Doe Dep.\nat 28-29. Mr. Doe brought himself to the brink. Fortunately\nfor the children, and Mr. Doe, there were at least four\n               4\nchildren there, and Mr. Doe “kn[ew] with four kids there,\nthat’s [having sexual contact with children] pretty difficult\n\n\n4\n  Mr. Doe earlier testified that there were five children at Murdock\nPark that evening. See Doe Dep. at 27.\n\f10                                                No. 01-3624\n\nto do. It’s a wide open area. Those thoughts were there, but\nthey, you know weren’t realistic at the time. They were just\nthoughts.” Id.\n  What if there were only one child there that evening?\nWould Mr. Doe have succumbed to his urges and consid-\nered the opportunity more “realistic”? Mr. Doe’s deposition\ntestimony suggests the answer. Fortunately, on that January\nevening, Mr. Doe passed up the opportunity to gratify com-\npletely his urges. Fortunately as well, through an anony-\nmous caller, the City of Lafayette found out that Mr. Doe\nhad engaged in psychiatric brinkmanship and endangered\nsome of the City’s most vulnerable citizens, children, in a\nplace where children should be safe to enjoy the premises,\nbut where, unfortunately, they also are quite susceptible to\nabuse, a park. Of course, the City was aware of not only this\nincident, but also of Mr. Doe’s criminal history. City officials\nunderstandably concluded that they had a duty to take\naction to protect the children. The course they chose was to\nban Mr. Doe from the City’s parks.\n  Mr. Doe does not believe that the officials’ chosen course\nwas a constitutionally permissible one. He submits that the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution pro-\nhibit the City from taking this action. The district court dis-\nagreed; it granted summary judgment to the City. We\nreview that decision de novo. See Rogers v. City of Chicago,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780984\"><a href=\"/opinion/780984/patricia-rogers-v-city-of-chicago-an-illinois-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 752 (7th Cir. 2003).\n\n\nA. First Amendment Claim\n  The First Amendment states in relevant part: “Congress\nshall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.”\nU.S. Const. amend. I. Our first task is to ascertain whether\nany of the values protected by this provision are implicated\nin the situation before us.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                      11\n\n                                1.\n  At the core of the First Amendment is the protection of the\nright to self-expression. Constitutional jurisprudence gives\nthis constitutional value a generous ambit, protecting self-\n                                 5\nexpression in its myriad forms.\n  Keeping in mind the broad scope of this constitutional\nprotection, we nevertheless find no such value at stake in\nthe factual record before us. Mr. Doe makes very clear why\nhe went to the park. He did not go to the park to advocate\nthe legalization of sexual relations between adults and\nminors. He did not go into the park to display a sculpture,\nread a poem or perform a play celebrating sexual relations\nbetween adults and minors. He did not go into the park for\nsome higher purpose of self-realization through expression.\nIn fact, he did not go into the park to engage in expression\nat all. Rather, he went “cruising” in the parks “looking for\nchildren” to satisfy his sexual urges. He certainly was aware\nof his propensity in this regard and, of course, of his history\nof sexual assault. Nevertheless, he put himself in a situation\nthat increased, substantially, the not-so-remote possibility of\nhis acting on these impulses. On this factual record, it is\ndifficult to ascertain how the freedom of self-expression is\n             6\nimplicated.\n\n\n5\n  For example, protection has been extended to the reading of\nobscene material in one’s home, see Stanley v. Georgia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107898\"><a href=\"/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1969), profanity, see Cohen v.

The Supreme Court has long\nheld that the First Amendment protects a broad range of\nspeech and conduct, but only “conduct with a significant\nexpressive element that drew the legal remedy in the first\nplace.” Arcara v.

Like the illegal\nsexual activity being regulated in Arcara, it is indisputable\nthat Mr. Doe’s urges and actions “manifest[ ] absolutely no\nelement of protected expression,” Arcara, 478 U.S. at 705,\nand the City’s ban “bears absolutely no connection to any\nexpressive activity,” id. at 707 n.3.

Furthermore, Mr. Doe’s urges, if they triggered First\nAmendment scrutiny, would be characterized as a form of child\npornography, the possession and distribution of which has been\nheld unprotected by the Supreme Court.

That is, reg-\nulations aimed at conduct which have only an incidental\neffect on thought do not violate the First Amendment’s\nfreedom of mind mandate. Id.; Osborne v.

He had sexual urges directed toward children, and he\ntook dangerous steps toward gratifying his urges by going\nto a place where he was likely to find children in a vulnera-\nble situation.\n  To characterize the ban as directed at “pure thought”\nwould require us to close our eyes to Mr. Doe’s actions.

Mr. Doe is an admitted\nsexual addict with a proclivity toward children; as such, he\nbelongs to a group of persons who are more susceptible to\nhaving sexual desires with respect to children and to acting\non those urges. We cannot ignore, nor can we say the law\nsomehow commands the City to ignore, Mr. Doe’s pedo-\nphilia and the history of his battle with that affliction.\nFacing this reality certainly does not license society, acting\nthrough government, to exile, harass or marginalize Mr.\nDoe, but it permits government to fulfill its responsibility to\nprotect vulnerable children in dangerous situations.\n   In short, we must recognize the actual situation confront-\ning the City as well as the parents and children who look to\nthat City for protection. The children and their parents are\nnot concerned about Mr. Doe’s thoughts. They are con-\ncerned about his coming to the park to achieve sexual grati-\nfication. They do not need to wait until a child is molested\nto take steps to protect their children. The First Amendment\ndoes not prohibit the City from taking the action it did to\nprotect its children. It does not require the City to act in an\nostrichlike fashion and expose the children of the City to the\nrisk that, on a future date, a child will wander further from\nthe group, present a better opportunity and experience the\ntragic consequences.\n\f20                                                   No. 01-3624\n\nB. Fourteenth Amendment Claim\n   The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\nprovides that the state shall not “deprive any person of life,\nliberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const.\namend. XIV. The case law acknowledges two distinct\nstrands of analysis under this Clause. The first—procedural\ndue process—allows the government to deprive a citizen of\n“life, liberty, or property” only in accordance with certain\nprocedural protections. Mr. Doe did not raise this issue in\nthe district court, and he has not raised it in this court. We\ntherefore have no occasion to address this issue and express\nno view with respect to the City’s treatment of Mr. Doe in\nthis regard.\n  Mr. Doe relies exclusively on the other strand of due pro-\ncess analysis: substantive due process. When viewing the\nClause from this perspective, the Supreme Court has empha-\nsized that the appropriate inquiry is not whether governmen-\ntal authorities afforded the individual certain procedural\nprotection. Rather, the inquiry is whether the individual has\nbeen subjected to “the arbitrary exercise of the powers of\ngovernment, unrestrained by the established principles of\nprivate rights and distributive justice.” Bank of Columbia v.\nOkely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235, 244 (1819), quoted in County of\nSacramento v.

The difficulty\narises because rights can be characterized in numerous ways,\nand the characterization of a right plausibly can fall at a\nnumber of points along a continuum of generality. These\ndifficulties, however, are constrained by two factors. First,\nand perhaps most obvious, we are constrained by the factual\nrecord before us, which sets the boundaries of the liberty\ninterest truly at issue in the case. Second, the Supreme Court\nhas limited, significantly, the level of generality at which we\nmay define a right. Our “careful description” of the asserted\nright must be one that is specific and concrete, one that\n                                                    10\navoids sweeping abstractions and generalities.

This language, while perhaps some support for\nthe general right to intrastate travel, cannot be read as the\n\n\n13\n     As Professors Rotunda and Nowak have explained:\n      In Chicago v. Morales, the Supreme Court invalidated a law\n      that gave a police officer the authority to order individuals\n      to disperse whenever the police officer believed the group of\n      people who were gathered together in a public place involved\n      one or more “street gang” members who were “loitering.”\n      Justice Stevens wrote for six Justices in finding that the law vio-\n      lated due process, because it was so vague that it allowed totally\n      arbitrary and capricious enforcement by police officers. How-\n      ever, the portion of Justice Stevens’s opinion that described the\n      law as restricting “liberty” was joined only by three Justices. The\n      dissenters attacked the majority, and the plurality opinion, for\n      protecting an activity that they believed was not a fundamental\n      constitutional right and was a constitutionally protected liberty\n      interest.\n        The Morales case did not require any fundamental rights\n      analysis. In the portion of his opinion that was written for\n      only three Justices, Justice Stevens noted that the Court was\n      not ruling that the ability to stay on a sidewalk was a funda-\n      mental constitutional right. Justice Stevens did not assert that\n      the judiciary should closely scrutinize government laws\n      regulating how many people could be on a sidewalk or the\n      conditions on which people could walk down sidewalks in\n      public places. Rather, the Stevens opinion, and the concurring\n      Justices, merely found that the government could not make\n      some form of human activity criminal without providing\n      minimally adequate notice to individuals concerning the type\n      of activity that would violate the law. Just as every law must\n      survive the minimal rationality test, every criminal law must\n      provide some notice to individuals concerning the conduct it\n      makes criminal and provide some limitation of police discretion.\n2 Ronald D.

As we have discussed at some length in an earlier\nsection of this opinion, Mr. Doe’s conduct on the January\n2000 night in question does not involve expression, and Mr.\nDoe’s stated reasons for now wanting to enter the park are\nunrelated to expression. See Doe Aff. ¶ 7. Indeed, it is telling\nthat Mr. Doe does not even mention the public forum line of\ncases in his First Amendment argument.\n  In sum, assuming the record would support his conten-\ntion that he is seeking a right to enter public parks simply to\nwander and loiter innocently, we cannot characterize that\nright as “fundamental.”\n\n\n                              2.\n  Because we have concluded that the City’s ban does not\nencroach on a fundamental liberty interest, we are bound to\napply the rational basis standard of review to the City’s ban.\nAccordingly, we must ask whether the ban is “rationally\nrelated to a legitimate government interest, or alternatively\nphrased,” whether the ban is “arbitrary” or “irrational.” Lee\nv.

Furthermore, the ban of Mr.\nDoe from the City’s parks is rationally related to that end.\nMr. Doe admits that he is a sexual addict who always will\nhave inappropriate urges toward children; his physician\nreadily concedes that sexual addicts like Mr. Doe sometimes\nfall down the slippery slope into abuse; and, in January of\n2000, he started down the slippery slope when he went to\nthe parks in response to those urges and did not act on them\nonly because they were not “realistic” at the time. Add these\nfacts to the reality that children, some of the most vulnera-\nble members of society, are susceptible to abuse in parks,\nand it is hard to see how the City’s ban is anything but\nrational.\n  Indeed, even if we were required to judge the ban under\nthe strict scrutiny standard, we would uphold its validity.\nStrict scrutiny mandates that the governmental regulation\nat issue have a compelling government interest and be nar-\nrowly tailored to serve that interest. See Billings v. Madison\nMetro. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774324\"><a href=\"/opinion/774324/bruce-and-sharon-billings-the-parents-of-a-minor-child-bb-v-madison/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 815 (7th Cir. 2001). Again, Mr.\nDoe concedes the compelling nature of the City’s interest in\nprotecting its youth; therefore, the only question is whether the\nban is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The narrow\ntailoring inquiry requires that we ask whether there are\n“other, reasonable ways to achieve th[e] goals with a lesser\nburden on constitutionally protected activity.” Johnson, 310\nF.3d at 503 (quoting Dunn v.

If there are, the City “may not choose the way of\ngreater interference. If it acts at all, it must choose ‘less\ndrastic means.’ ” Id.\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   31\n\n  The City has banned only one child sex offender, Mr. Doe,\nfrom the parks, and they have banned Mr. Doe only because\nof his near-relapse in January of 2000 when he went into the\n                                                  14\npark to engage in psychiatric brinkmanship. Mr. Doe\nargues that the ban could be narrower both geographi-\ncally—limited to certain areas of the park system— and\ntemporally—it could extend for a finite period of time. This\nargument ignores that the only “less drastic means” the City\nmust conform to are those which are “reasonable” means of\nachieving the compelling interest. Id. The City cannot\nreasonably anticipate what parts of the park system children\nwill be located in at all times, and, on this record, we have\nno basis on which to question its judgment that children are\nvulnerable throughout the park system. As to the temporal\nnature of the ban, Mr. Doe concedes that his sexual urges\ntoward children always will be with him, and his behavior\nin January of 2000, coupled with his criminal history,\npresents a compelling case that he is prone to relapse.\nNothing in the record suggests this is likely to subside over\ntime. Accordingly, even assuming that we ought to consider\nthis ban under the strict scrutiny standard, we still would\nhold it was valid as the narrowest reasonable means for the\nCity to advance its compelling interest of protecting its\nchildren from the demonstrable threat of sexual abuse by\nMr. Doe.\n\n\n\n\n14\n  Mr. Doe suggests that his exclusion is irrational because there\nare many convicted sex offenders living in the same geographic\narea who are not banned from the parks. According to this rec-\nord, however, the City does not have knowledge that relapses or\nnear-relapses involving other sex offenders have occurred on city\nproperty. There is certainly nothing in the record to suggest the\nCity would act differently when faced with a similar case.\n\f32                                                No. 01-3624\n\n                         Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, we must reject Mr. Doe’s chal-\nlenges based on the First and Fourteenth Amendments and\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n                                                    AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, with whom ROVNER and DIANE P.\nWOOD, Circuit Judges, join in dissenting. John Doe was\nbanned for life from all park property in the City of Lafay-\nette, Indiana—including a golf course, sports stadium, and\ncity pools. As this ban violates Doe’s First Amendment right\nto freedom of thought by impermissibly punishing him for\nthose thoughts, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n                     I. BACKGROUND\n   Convicted sex offenders, particularly child molesters, are\na reviled group. Child molestation is one of the most\nheinous and deplorable crimes, attacking our most precious\nresource, our children. John Doe is a member of this under-\nstandably vilified group. His criminal history includes convic-\ntions for child molestation, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and\nwindow peeping. His last conviction was in 1991, ten years\nbefore this litigation. Doe’s crimes were committed in\nschools, a convenience store, and outside private residences\n(though none in a park). He admits that his urges are\ntriggered by emotional vulnerability, typically in the late\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                         33\n\nevening. As a result of these criminal convictions, Doe has\nbeen hospitalized, imprisoned, under house arrest, and on\nprobation. He has been in active psychological treatment\nsince 1986, and voluntarily attends group therapy. Doe admits\nhe still has fantasies about children, and his psychologist\nopines that he will likely have these urges for the rest of his\nlife.\n  In January 2000, Doe was driving home from work and\n                                                        1\nstopped at Murdock Park, in the City of Lafayette, and\nwatched five youths in their early teens playing on a base-\nball diamond. Doe admits that, while observing them, he\nthought about having sexual contact with the children. After\nwatching them for 15-30 minutes, and without having any\ncontact with them, Doe left the park. “I said to myself: I’ve\ngot to get out of here before I do something, so I left.” Doe\n           2\nDep. at 27.\n  Once Doe left the park, he sent an emergency page to his\npsychologist’s answering service, which immediately con-\ntacted the doctor. Doe explained what occurred and ex-\n\n\n1\n   The majority points out that Doe came in contact with two\nparks, but his intention in going to the first park, Columbian\nPark, is far from clear. Doe explained in his deposition that he\nlived a short distance from that park, and there is no evidence\nthat he got out of his car or even stopped his car at the first park.\n2\n   Characterizing Doe’s ability to control his urges as “marginal,” the\nmajority seems to focus on Doe’s statements concerning the logistical\ndifficulty of approaching the teenagers on the baseball diamond.\nMajority opinion at 9. However, as the majority concedes and Doe\narticulates, he was able to control himself and leave the park. “While\nwatching the children in Murdock Park in January of 2000 I certainly\nhad sexual thoughts. However, I was not planning to act on my\nthoughts. I recognized that these were just unhealthy thoughts and\nI realized I needed to leave the park, which is what I did.” Doe\nAff. ¶ 5.\n\f34                                                    No. 01-3624\n\npressed that he was upset about the incident. As part of his\ntreatment, his psychologist suggested that he discuss the\nincident with his sexual addicts anonymous (SAA) group,\nwhich was to meet a few days later. The doctor also focused\non the fact that Doe was able to control his urge and leave\n                                                   3\nthe park as a positive step in his rehabilitation. As the\nlongest non-offending member of the SAA group,\nits members were very disappointed by Doe’s disclosure. In\nresponse to this incident, Doe began voluntarily receiving\nweekly shots of Depo-Provera to aid in suppressing his\nurges.\n  An anonymous source reported Doe’s January visit to the\npark, and the thoughts he had while he was there, to Doe’s\nformer probation officer. The probation officer then contacted\nthe Lafayette Police Department, which prompted a conver-\nsation between the Police Chief, the Superintendent of the\nLafayette Parks Department, and a City attorney regarding\nDoe’s appearance in the park. Their discussion focused on\nthe nature of Doe’s January visit to the park and his criminal\nhistory, although all acknowledge that Doe was no longer\n                                        4\nserving a sentence or on probation. As a result of this\nconversation, the City Parks Department issued an order\n\n3\n  Doe’s psychologist explained that “[i]n the first phase of re-\ncovery, our primary goal is to keep the patient as far away from\nany circumstance that might hold a trigger for him.” While, “[i]n\nthe second phase of recovery, we actually encourage the patient\nto begin to determine the boundaries of what’s safe and what’s\nnot safe.” Moisan-Thomas Dep. at 14-15.\n4\n  Doe was not on probation in January 2000 and was not even\nrestricted from entering the park during his period of house\narrest a decade earlier, thus, this analysis will not consider\nwhether the restrictions imposed by the City might have been\nappropriate as a condition of release as part of the earlier criminal\nsentences.

Schave, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765547\"><a href=\"/opinion/765547/united-states-v-karl-c-schave/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841 (7th Cir.\n1999).\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   35\n\npermanently banning Doe from entering any City park\nproperty at any time and for any purpose under threat of\narrest for trespass. The City did not provide any pre-is-\nsuance review of the ban, nor was Doe afforded an opportu-\n                5\nnity to appeal.\n  The ban order is both geographically and temporally\nbroad. The City of Lafayette’s extensive park system in-\ncludes several large parks, many smaller neighborhood\nparks, a zoo, a golf course, a sports complex, a baseball sta-\ndium, and several pools. Typically, ban orders are issued by\nthe City against those who have vandalized park property\nor interfered with park patrons. The resulting bans ordi-\nnarily are issued for a week or, at most, a summer. In this\n                                                           6\ncase, the ban order against Doe has no termination date.\n\n\n                        II. ANALYSIS\n  Doe’s First Amendment appeal raises several questions\nnot typically before a court. May a city constitutionally ban\none of its citizens from public property based on its discov-\nery of that individual’s immoral thoughts? Is being banned\nfrom public property a “punishment”? Does the First\nAmendment protect a citizen’s right to think about commit-\nting a crime, even if he has committed that crime in the\npast? This scenario is quite unusual, as it is a rare case\nwhere thoughts, as distinct from deeds, become publicly\n\n\n5\n   Although I have grave concerns about the procedural due\nprocess infirmities in the method employed by the City to issue\nthe ban, Doe does not challenge the order on this ground. I con-\ntinue to be intrigued by Doe’s strategic decision to forgo this\nstraightforward claim.\n6\n  As the majority points out, Doe also has not challenged the ban\non the grounds that it is unconstitutionally overbroad. I am also\npuzzled by the omission of this issue from Doe’s discussion.\n\f36                                                No. 01-3624\n\nknown. Most thinking, unless purposefully revealed to\nothers, remains one’s own. Unlike other cases in which the\nstate becomes aware of an individual’s mental state because\nof his or her actions, here the City acknowledges that Doe’s\nown revelation of his thoughts, not any outward expression\ndemonstrating his thinking, is the basis for its actions.\n\n\nA. The First Amendment prohibits government control\n   over a citizen’s thoughts.\n  The freedom of individuals to control their own thoughts\nhas been repeatedly acknowledged by the Supreme Court.\nIn West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n642 (1943), the Court upheld a challenge by Jehovah’s\nWitnesses to West Virginia’s requirement that all schoolchil-\ndren participate in a pledge and salute honoring the United\nStates flag. The Court ruled that such an obligation would\nimpermissibly infringe upon “the sphere of intellect and\nspirit which it is the purpose of the First Amendment to our\nConstitution to reserve from all official control.” Id.\n   Although Barnette’s challenge to the West Virginia enact-\nment was based on religious conviction, id., the guarantee\nof freedom of the intellect has not been limited to beliefs\nconcerning politics or religion.

A central focus of the\nCourt’s discussion was the quintessential principle that the\ngovernment’s power does not extend to control of a person’s\nthoughts: “a State has no business telling a man, sitting\nalone in his own house, what books he may read or what\nfilms he may watch. Our whole constitutional heritage\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                      37\n\nrebels at the thought of giving government the power to\ncontrol men’s minds.” Id. at 565. Once again, the Court tied\nthis freedom to fundamental principles of the First Amend-\nment, holding that “it is wholly inconsistent with the\nphilosophy of the First Amendment” for the government to\nexercise “the right to control the moral content of a person’s\n                          7\nthoughts.” Id. at 565-66.\n  The Court has also recognized the intersection of freedom\nof the mind, protected by the First Amendment, with the\nright to privacy.

In Free Speech Coalition,\nthe Court considered federal legislation that criminalized\nvirtual child pornography, so named because although the\nimages appear to depict minors, they were produced without\nusing real children. Id. at 239. The Court struck down the\nban, finding that Congress could not justify prohibition of the\nconstitutionally-protected speech. Id. at 256. There, the fact that\npossession of virtual child pornography may ignite sexually\nimmoral thoughts about children was not enough to justify\nbanning it. Id. at 252-53. Given the Court’s long-standing rec-\nognition of the freedom of thought, the City of Lafayette’s ban\norder must be analyzed in light of the principle that freedom of\nthe mind occupies a highly-protected position in our con-\nstitutional heritage.\n  The City defends the ban as a measure to protect its youth\nfrom a person with a history of sex offenses whom it fears\nmay harm its children in the future. As part of this argu-\nment, the City and the majority seem to equate a propensity\nto commit crime with an inability to control one’s impulses,\nimplying that Doe’s thoughts about children and close prox-\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                   39\n\nimity to them will lead him to strike again. First, propensity\nand volitional capacity are distinct aspects of conduct. See\nKansas v. Crane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118479\"><a href=\"/opinion/118479/kansas-v-crane/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 (2002) (recognizing that the\nConstitution does not permit the commitment of a pedophile\nwithout some lack-of-control determination thereby recogniz-\ning the possibility that a pedophile may control his urges).\nFurther, this fear—that an individual’s thoughts may\nencourage action—is not enough to curb protected thinking.\n  The Court in Stanley addressed the line between crime\nprevention and protected speech, stating,\n    we believe that in the context of private consumption of\n    ideas and information we should adhere to the view\n    that ‘[a]mong free men, the deterrents ordinarily to be\n    applied to prevent crime are education and punishment\n    for violations of the law.’\n394 U.S. at 566-67 (emphasis added).\n   Further, in Free Speech Coalition, the government proposed\na similar theory in defense of the ban of virtual child\npornography. 535 U.S. at 253. Attempting to prevent the\npotential indirect harm to children posed by pedophiles,\nCongress reasoned that the virtual pictures may serve to\n“whet” the appetites of pedophiles and may be used to\nconvince a reluctant child to participate in sexual acts. Id. at\n241. In line with its previous stance in Stanley, the Court\nsquarely rejected this theory: “The government ‘cannot con-\nstitutionally premise legislation on the desirability of control-\nling a person’s private thoughts.’ First Amendment freedoms\nare most in danger when the government seeks to control\nthought or to justify its laws for that impermissible end.” Id.\n(quoting Stanley, 394 U.S. at 566). Citing criminal statutes 18\nU.S.C. §§ 2241 and 2251, which prohibit sexual abuse, the\nCourt reasoned that “Congress may pass valid laws to\nprotect children from abuse,” however, “[t]he prospect of\n\f40                                                No. 01-3624\n\ncrime . . . by itself does not justify laws suppressing pro-\ntected speech.” Id. at 245 (emphasis added).\n  The majority aptly points out that while pure thoughts are\nprotected by the First Amendment, non-expressive actions\nare not. First Amendment jurisprudence is fastened upon\nthe critical distinction between thinking and acting on those\nthoughts. See, e.g., Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 253\n(“[T]he Court’s First Amendment cases draw vital distinc-\ntions between words and deeds, between ideas and con-\nduct.”); Reidel, 402 U.S. at 356 (private thoughts or fantasies\nare protected by the First Amendment, but selling or buying\nobscenity in the mail is not protected activity and may be\nproscribed without violating the First Amendment). The\nmajority argues that Doe’s steps of driving to the park and\nwatching children constitute non-expressive conduct. The\nquestion then is whether the First Amendment protects a\ncitizen who goes to a venue and thinks about committing a\ncrime? It is clear on this record, that absent Doe’s thoughts\n(and arguably his status as a pedophile, which I address\nbelow) the City would be uninterested in Doe’s decision to\ngo to the park that fateful day. Moreover, divorcing Doe’s\nthoughts from the City’s decision to ban him also strips the\nCity of its alleged “rational basis” for its decision.\n  Recognizing that no child was directly harmed by Doe’s\ndecision to go to the park, the issue here, like that in Free\nSpeech Coalition, is the scope of the City’s power to curb\nprotected thought under the First Amendment to prevent\ncriminal conduct. In the context of child pornography and\nthe potential for child abuse, New York v. Ferber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110794\"><a href=\"/opinion/110794/new-york-v-ferber/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 759-60 (1982) and Osborne v.

For example, in\nFerber, the Court upheld the prohibition of the distribution\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                         41\n\nand sale of child pornography, even though it did not meet\nthe definition of obscenity under Miller v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108838\"><a href=\"/opinion/108838/miller-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), because of the actual harm suffered by partici-\npants in the making of the child pornography. 458 U.S. at\n759-60. Further explaining this distinction, the Court in\nOsborne allowed the prohibition of purely private possession\nof child pornography based on the fact that it helps facilitate\ncriminal conduct, such as its use in soliciting minors to\nparticipate in sexual acts or whetting the appetites of pedo-\nphiles. 495 U.S. at 110-11. However, the Court also reasoned\nthat the actual harm suffered by participants was a key\ningredient to the constitutionality of the prohibition. Id.\nFinally, in Free Speech Coalition, the Court reaffirmed the\nimportance of this actual harm element by reasoning that\nthe First Amendment is violated when speech which “rec-\nords no crime and creates no victims by its production” is\n                             8\nprohibited. 535 U.S. at 250.\n\n\n\n8\n  The Court’s holding in Free Speech Coalition directly rejects the\nmajority’s puzzling attempt to carve out categories of thought\nthat should be “unprotected” because they might relate to ob-\nscenity or may “incite” unlawful action. Thought is protected\nregardless of its underlying content. See Reidel, 402 U.S. at 356\n(“[Reidel] has no complaints about governmental violations of his\nprivate thoughts or fantasies, but stands squarely on a claimed\nFirst Amendment right to do business in obscenity. . .”).

Presumably, untold numbers of\nLafayette residents wander the City’s parks every day, many\nof them potentially thinking offensive or objectionable\nthoughts. The City has not suggested that it monitors sex\noffenders’ presence in the City parks, and it could not cite\nany other example of an individual banned for mere\npresence in the park. The only factors that differentiate Doe\nfrom others are that the City was apprised of his thoughts\nwhile he was in the park and its knowledge of his past\nconduct.\n   The majority’s reliance on cases such as United States v.\nO’Brien, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107701\"><a href=\"/opinion/107701/united-states-v-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376 (1968) and Arcara v.

These cases focus\non the distinction between mere conduct and expression\nand do not contradict long-standing principles regarding\nprotection of thought. Cf. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at\n253 (“The right to think is the beginning of freedom, and\nspeech must be protected from the government because\nspeech is the beginning of thought.”). Furthermore, the ban\nis not a content-neutral widely applied general ordinance,\nwhich incidentally affects a narrow form of expressive con-\nduct, as was the case in O’Brien and Clark v. Community for\nCreative Non-Violence, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111245\"><a href=\"/opinion/111245/clark-v-community-for-creative-non-violence/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). Rather, the City\nseeks to prohibit Doe from entering its park facilities based\non his thoughts, which, as stated above, are the bedrock of\nexpression. Finally, this situation is distinguishable from\nArcara. In Arcara, the Court found that the First Amendment\ndid not preclude the closing of a bookstore when it was undis-\nputed that solicitation of prostitution and other sexual acts\nwere being performed by patrons in the store. See id. at 705\n(“[W]e underscored the fallacy of seeking to use the First\nAmendment as a cloak for obviously unlawful public sexual\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                    43\n\nconduct. . .”). Therefore, he is not seeking to use the First\nAmendment to cloak unlawful conduct as no such unlawful\nconduct occurred.\n\n\nB. The ban imposed on Doe is a punishment.\n  The majority characterizes the ban as a form of “civil\nexclusion,” majority opinion at n. 8, and brushes aside the\nargument that the ban is punitive in nature. However, it is\nclear from the record that the City seeks to punish Doe by\nbanning him from public park facilities based on the City’s\ndiscovery of his fantasies.\n  When determining whether a governmental action consti-\ntutes a punishment, courts review such factors as:\n    [W]hether a sanction involves an affirmative restraint,\n    how history has regarded it, whether it applies to behavior\n    already a crime, the need for a finding of scienter, its rela-\n    tionship to a traditional aim of punishment, the presence\n    of a nonpunitive alternative purpose, and whether it is\n    excessive in relation to that purpose.\nKansas v.

SeeYoungberg v. Romeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (1982) (discussing the “freedom of movement”\nand citing Greenholtz v.

In its attempt to characterize the City’s action\nas “nonpunitive,” the majority cites Smith for the proposition\nthat the Constitution permits the “imposition of restrictive\nmeasures on sex offenders adjudged to be dangerous.” 538\nU.S. at 93. Majority opinion at n.8. However, this quote fails\nto tell the full story. The Court went on to affirm the con-\nstitutionality of Alaska’s sex offender registry because it\n“does not restrain activities sex offenders may pursue,” id.\nat 100, and the “dissemination of truthful information in\nfurtherance of a legitimate governmental objective” is not\npunishment, id. at 98. In contrast, Lafayette’s ban expressly\nprohibits Doe from entering any property deemed a part of\nthe Lafayette Park system, which encompasses far more\nthan its parks. Far from merely giving the public truthful\ninformation, this ban affirmatively restricts Doe’s freedom\nof movement. The City’s action is reminiscent of a partial\nbanishment, which serves to expel Doe from certain por-\ntions of City property, see id. at 98 (discussing banishment\nas a measure historically recognized as a punishment), and\ntherefore is not akin to a duty to register.\n  Perhaps most telling is the ban’s relationship to the tra-\nditional aims of punishment. See Stephen B. Reed, The\nDemise of Ozzie and Harriet: Effective Punishment of Domestic\nAbusers, 17 New Eng. J. on Crim. & Civ. Confinement 337,\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                  45\n\n358-63 (1991) (discussing the traditional aims of punishment as\ndeterrence, incapacitation, retribution, and rehabilitation).\nSpecifically, the ban serves the twin goals of deterrence,\nwhich are to prevent an individual from repeating conduct\nas well as preventing similar acts by others. See id. at 358-59.\nNews of Doe’s ban will surely serve to warn others in his\nposition that they too may be restricted from entering\nportions of Lafayette if the City is apprised of their immoral\nthoughts. (The ban also serves to deter sex offenders from\nseeking treatment, but I will address that issue later.)\n  Further, the ban segregates Doe from the community and\nsets him apart from the general population. This form of\nsegregation is similar to a condition of probation or super-\nvised release. See Smith, 538 U.S. at 101 (“Probation and\nsupervised release entail a series of mandatory conditions\nand allow the supervising officer to seek the revocation of\nprobation or release in case of infraction.”); Schave, 186 F.3d\nat 841 (preventing a convicted explosives dealer from “as-\nsociating with organizations that, or members who, espouse\nviolence or the supremacy of the white race”). Here, the City\nhas set out a mandatory restriction and should Doe set foot\nin a City park facility he may be prosecuted for trespass. See\nUnited States v. Holm, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781671\"><a href=\"/opinion/781671/united-states-v-delbert-r-holm/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 878 (2003) (“to the extent\nthat the condition [of supervised release] is intended to be\na total ban on Internet use, it sweeps more broadly and\nimposes a greater deprivation on Holm’s liberty than is neces-\nsary. . .”) (emphasis added).\n  The ban is also excessive in relation to its stated purpose\nas it contains no termination date. Critical to the analysis in\nHendricks, was the Court’s determination that the petitioner\nwould be confined only so long as he remained a danger to\nhimself or to the public. 521 U.S. at 363. The Court also\nnoted that the duration of confinement was only “poten-\ntially” indefinite. Id. We have no such safeguards here. Doe\n\f46                                                No. 01-3624\n\nhas been banned for life, with no prospect of review or\nreconsideration by the City.\n   I recognize that Doe is not challenging the ban on pro-\ncedural grounds, see n. 5, infra, however, the utter lack of\npre-application procedure and post-application review is\ncritical to the question of whether the ban is punitive. Both\nHendricks and Smith relied on the imposition of sanctions\nafter constitutionally appropriate procedures to protect against\npotential arbitrary government action. See Hendricks, 521\nU.S. at 357 (“We have consistently upheld such involuntary\ncommitment statutes provided the confinement takes place\npursuant to proper procedures and evidentiary standards.”);\nSmith, 538 U.S. at 84 (registration only mandated for those\npreviously convicted of a sexual offense). One could argue\nthat these cases are inapposite based on this difference\nalone. The lack of such procedural safeguards, i.e., periodic\nreview of the necessity of the ban, any procedure to test the\naccuracy of the information used by the City as its basis for\naction, and the lack of any connection to Doe’s ability to\ncontrol his urges, serves to highlight the City’s actual mo-\ntivation.\n  Finally, the fact that the anonymous caller contacted Doe’s\nformer probation officer, who then in turn contacted the\npolice department (criminal units) who then contacted the\nsuperintendent of parks and the city attorney further under-\nscores the City’s intention to punish rather than civilly\nsanction. The resulting ban order is a judicially enforceable\ncriminal decree which punished Doe for his thoughts. See\nHill v. Colorado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118385\"><a href=\"/opinion/118385/hill-v-colorado/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 713 (2000) (quoting Madsen v.\nWomen’s Health Center, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (1994) (reasoning\nthat a judicial decree poses a “greater risk of censorship and\ndiscriminatory application than do general ordinances.”)).\n  Having found that the ban is in fact punitive, the maxim\ncogitationis poenam nemo patitur (no one is punishable solely\n\fNo. 01-3624                                                     47\n\nfor his thoughts) is particularly apt. This maxim serves as a\ncornerstone of the criminal justice system and has shaped\n                                                            9\nmany of the constitutional boundaries of criminal law.\nPerhaps the Victorian legal scholar James Fitzjames Stephen\nbest explained this basic limit on government power: “If it\nwere not so restricted it would be utterly intolerable; all\nmankind would be criminals, and most of their lives would\nbe passed trying and punishing each other for offenses\nwhich could never be proved.” 1 James Fitzjames Stephen,\nA History of the Criminal Law of England 78 (1883).\n\n\nC. A citizen may not be punished based on his status.\n  My conclusion is buttressed by a fundamental understanding\nof the bounds of punishable conduct. This axiomatic\nprinciple is illustrated by the distinction between punish-\nment for a person’s status—impermissible under the Eighth\nAmendment—and sanctions levied for a person’s conduct.\nSee Robinson v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106451\"><a href=\"/opinion/106451/robinson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1962). In Robin-\nson, the Supreme Court struck down a California statute that\nmade addiction to narcotics illegal. Id. at 666-67. Because the\nstatute required no illegal act, but criminalized mere status\nas a drug addict, it violated the Eighth Amendment’s\nprohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Id. at 667.\n\n\n9\n  The proscription against penalizing for ideas alone has been\nrecognized for centuries, see 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries on\nLaws of England, 21 (1765) (“[N]o temporal tribunal can search\nthe heart or fathom the intentions of the mind, otherwise than as\nthey are demonstrated by outward actions, it therefore cannot\npunish for what it cannot know.”), and is reflected in modern\ncodifications of the common law, see Model Penal Code and\nCommentaries, Comment to § 2.01 at 214-15 (1985) (“It is\nfundamental that a civilized society does not punish for thoughts\nalone.”).\n\f48                                                No. 01-3624\n\nThis distinction was further refined in Powell v.

There, the Court upheld\nPowell’s arrest for appearing drunk in public because the\nTexas law did not sanction Powell merely for his status as\nan alcoholic, but for his act of overimbibing in public. Id. at\n535-36. The Court rested its holding on the fact that Powell\nvoluntarily committed sanctionable conduct: “The entire\nthrust of Robinson’s interpretation of the Cruel and Unusual\nPunishment Clause is that criminal penalties may be\ninflicted only if the accused has committed some act, has\nengaged in some behavior, which society has an interest in\npreventing, or perhaps in historical common law terms, has\ncommitted some actus reus.” Id. at 533.

The error\nin punishing actions similar to Doe’s is more easily seen by\nway of analogies removed from the sensitive context of\nchild molestation. By way of comparison, courts would not\nsanction criminal punishment of an individual with a crim-\ninal history of bank robbery (a crime, like child molestation,\nwith a high rate of recidivism, United States v.

Code § 35-41-5-1. Here, the\nmost that can be said of Doe’s action is that he drove to the\npark and watched children. Even if it is assumed that Doe\nintended to molest children when he stood in the park,\nDoe’s mere presence in the park is not enough to constitute\na “substantial step” towards an attempted sex offense. See\nState v.

App. 2001) (affirming\ndismissal of attempted child molestation charge when\ndefendant allegedly agreed to meet minor at restaurant parking\nlot, drove there, and brought condoms because conviction\nwould result in “no limit on the reach of ‘attempt’ crimes”).\nIn the same way that the individual with a history of rob-\nbing banks could not be charged with attempted bank robbery\nfor standing across the street from the bank and thinking\nabout robbing it, Doe may not be punished for merely\nthinking perverted thoughts about children.\n  Finally, Doe’s conduct is not akin to stalking, which, while\nperhaps motivated by thoughts, requires actual threatening\nconduct by the stalker. Stalking statutes typically require\nthat a defendant: (1) knowingly or intentionally; (2) engage\n\f50                                                     No. 01-3624\n\nin a course of conduct involving continuous or repeated\nharassment; (3) that would cause a reasonable person to feel\nterrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened; and (4)\nactually causes that person to feel terrorized, frightened, in-\ntimidated, or threatened. See, e.g., Ind. Code § 35-45-10-1.\nDoe’s actions do not come close to criminal conduct pun-\nishable as stalking. He did not “continually” or “repeatedly”\ngo to the public park; his ban order was based on a single\nvisit. See Landis v.

Nor did Doe’s gaze\nor proximity cause any specific person to feel frightened or\nthreatened; indeed, there is no evidence that anyone even\nnoticed Doe’s presence. Frazier v. Delco Elecs.

CONCLUSION\n   In the City’s haste to take action to protect its children, an\nadmirable goal, both the majority and the City fail to ap-\nprehend the possible secondary effects of this ban on the\nvery safety it seeks to ensure. As a society grappling with\nthe problem of pedophilia, see Crane, 534 U.S. at 414 (requiring\nsome lack-of-control determination in the civil commitment\nof convicted pedophile), we have limited resources in our\narsenal to address the possibility that someone like Doe may\nreoffend. Once released back into our society, a former sex\noffender must feel free to seek therapy and must be sup-\nported in his efforts to control his urges rather than penal-\nized. Why deter former sex offenders from one of the few\ntreatments available? The importance of therapy cannot be\nunderstated. See 51 Am. Jur. 3d § 5 (“the group (led by the\ntherapist) works on each member’s issues, such as denial,\nguilt, the offender’s own sexual trauma, or lack of empathy\nfor the victim. This is a common technique for outpatient\ntreatment of sex offenders (often a condition of probation).\n. .”). The First Amendment’s concern with freedom of\nthought as a basis for the freedom of expression is high-\nlighted by the facts of this case. The chilling effect of this\nruling, i.e., that the communication of one’s thoughts may\nresult in being banned from public spaces, is frightening. See\nHodgkins v. Peterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784830\"><a href=\"/opinion/784830/nancy-hodgkins-colin-hodgkins-and-caroline-hodgkins-by-their-next-friend/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1056 (7th Cir. 2004)\n(“The Supreme Court has often noted that a realistic threat\nof arrest is enough to chill First Amendment rights.”). To\noversimplify the issue, as one of location or logistics (i.e., the\nargument that Doe can simply think elsewhere) fails to\naddress the problem of chilled speech, or here thought, that\nthe First Amendment seeks to secure.\n  One cannot be a thinking member of society and not be\nacutely aware of the critical problem of sex offenses against\nchildren. The substance of Doe’s sexual fantasies about\n\f52                                                    No. 01-3624\n\nchildren are repugnant and deplorable. Doe himself admits\nthat. But, of course, the fact that this court or the City of\nLafayette finds Doe’s thoughts offensive does not limit the\namount of First Amendment protection they are afforded.\nSee Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 245 (“It is also well\nestablished that speech may not be prohibited because it con-\ncerns subjects offending our sensibilities.”); Am.

Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118299\"><a href=\"/opinion/118299/chicago-v-morales/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1999) (plurality opinion)\n(remarking that the freedom to loiter for innocent purposes is\nprotected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment).
