Safeway argues the trial court erroneously denied Safeway’s motion in\n\nlimine and, as a result, erred in admitting a summary of Lopez’s medical expenses, which\n\nincluded amounts not actually owed or paid by her or anyone else. Finding no reversible\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n¶2            Although no trial transcripts have been furnished to this court, it appears\n\nundisputed that Lopez slipped and fell while entering a Safeway store and sustained various\n\ninjuries. She then filed this negligence action against Safeway. Before trial, Safeway moved\n\nin limine to prohibit Lopez from presenting evidence “reflecting charges for medical care,\n\nhealthcare or psychological care, which charges are above or beyond what was actually\n\naccepted by the healthcare provider in satisfaction of billings.” Based on information\n\nprovided by Lopez, Safeway pointed out that, although Lopez’s medical bills totaled\n\napproximately $59,700, more than $42,000 of that total was “completely written off as\n\nadjustments” and the remaining balance of $16,837 was fully satisfied through contractually\n\nagreed-upon payments. In its motion, Safeway argued Lopez should only be able to claim\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand present evidence on the $16,837, the amount “actually accepted in full satisfaction of\n\nthe services rendered.”\n\n¶3            After considering the parties’ memoranda and hearing oral argument, the trial\n\ncourt denied Safeway’s motion in limine. Thereafter, Lopez’s medical expense summary,\n\nreflecting total medical bills of $59,699.57, was admitted into evidence at trial. The jury\n\nfound in favor of Lopez, awarded damages of $400,000, but found her ten percent at fault\n\nand Safeway ninety percent at fault. This appeal followed the trial court’s entry of judgment\n\non the verdict and subsequent denial of Safeway’s motion for a new trial.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                                               I\n\n¶4            Safeway argues “[t]he trial court’s pretrial ruling on [Safeway’s] Motion in\n\nLimine and the subsequent submission of full medical bills constitute reversible error\n\nrequiring a retrial.” Relying primarily on Anderson v. Muniz, 21 Ariz. App. 25, 515 P.2d\n\n52 (1973), Safeway maintains a “plaintiff’s recovery for medical expense claims should be\n\nlimited to contractually agreed rates accepted in full satisfaction for medical care, not the\n\nface amount of billings.” Therefore, Safeway asserts, the trial court erred in admitting\n\n“evidence at trial of the higher billing amounts which were never paid, and were fully\n\nsatisfied through contractually agreed upon reduction in charges.”\n\n¶5            Before turning to Safeway’s argument, we first address two preliminary issues\n\nLopez raises. First, as she points out, the parties stipulated in their joint pretrial statement\n\n\n                                               3\n\f“that the medical bills incurred by the Plaintiff, as itemized on a Summary Sheet of Medical\n\nExpenses, will be deemed as reasonable and customary medical expenses to the extent of\n\nthe Court’s ruling on the Defendant’s Motion in Limine . . . , as to the amount of medical\n\nbills that will be admissible.” Lopez suggests, without response by Safeway in its reply\n\nbrief, that “the foregoing stipulation seems to have mooted the issue now raised on appeal.”\n\nWe disagree.\n\n¶6             The apparent purpose of the stipulation was merely to ease the burden, or\n\nexpedite the process, of introducing Lopez’s medical expenses into evidence at trial once the\n\ntrial court ruled on the legal issue presented in Safeway’s motion in limine.1 The pretrial\n\nstatement does not manifest any intent that the court’s ruling on that motion would be\n\nbinding or otherwise unchallengeable on appeal. Nor did Lopez so argue at the hearing on\n\nSafeway’s motion in limine or, more importantly, in response to Safeway’s subsequent\n\nmotion for new trial. And the trial court did not cite or rely on the parties’ pretrial statement\n\nin denying Safeway’s motion for new trial. Therefore, we find Safeway’s substantive issue\n\non appeal neither moot nor waived. See Pavlik v. Chinle Unified Sch. Dist. No. 24, 195\n\n\n\n       1\n         In its motion in limine, Safeway stated “the parties could stipulate to the damages\nonce the court has entered its In Limine Ruling regarding the ‘phantom’ medical expenses.”\nSimilarly, at oral argument on that motion, held after the parties filed their joint pretrial\nstatement, Safeway’s counsel explained: “The game plan I have agreed to, stipulated to, is\nthat we are going to have you [the trial judge] decide the issue, and then either the jury is\ngoing to get this set of medical expenses or this set.” These statements place in context the\nstipulation made in the joint pretrial statement and do not reflect any intent to abandon the\nlegal issue raised in the motion in limine once the trial court had ruled on it.\n\n                                               4\n\fAriz. 148, ¶ 28, 985 P.2d 633, 640 (App. 1999) (by failing to raise waiver as a defense in\n\nthe trial court, defendant “waived its waiver argument”).\n\n¶7            Second, Lopez argues Safeway’s failure to provide the trial transcript makes\n\nit “impossible to analyze or decide any issues raised on this appeal.” Again, we disagree.\n\nAlthough Lopez questions how we can determine “whether Safeway’s objections [to her\n\nmedical expense claim] were properly made and preserved,” the record includes Safeway’s\n\nmotion in limine, the transcript of the argument on that motion, and the trial court’s ruling.\n\nBased on that ruling, the court later admitted Lopez’s medical expense summary into\n\nevidence at trial. Safeway’s pretrial motion preserved its objection to the amount of medical\n\nexpense Lopez could claim and recover. See State v. Burton, 144 Ariz. 248, 250, 697 P.2d\n\n331, 333 (1985) (“where a motion in limine is made and ruled upon, the objection raised\n\nin that motion is preserved for appeal, despite the absence of a specific objection at trial”);\n\nsee also State Bar Committee comment, Ariz. R. Civ. P. 7.2, 16 A.R.S., Pt. 1.\n\n¶8            In addition, although we review a trial court’s evidentiary rulings for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, Cervantes v. Rijlaarsdam, 190 Ariz. 396, 398, 949 P.2d 56, 58 (App. 1997),\n\nSafeway’s pretrial motion raised a purely legal issue that is subject to our de novo review\n\nand that is not dependent on evidence adduced at trial. See Dean v. Am. Family Mut. Ins.\n\nCo., 535 N.W.2d 342, 343 (Minn. 1995) (when facts are undisputed, issue of whether\n\ncollateral source rule applies is reviewed de novo); Smith v. Shaw, 159 S.W.3d 830, 832\n\n(Mo. 2005) (same); Weatherly v. Flournoy, 929 P.2d 296, 298 (Okla. Civ. App. 1996)\n\n\n                                              5\n\f(same). As Lopez acknowledges, the available record is sufficient to “decide the correctness\n\nof the trial court’s ruling on [the] motion in limine.”2 Accordingly, we do not view “the full\n\nevidence presented at trial” as indispensable to review of that ruling, as Lopez claims.\n\nFinally, if Lopez deemed the trial transcripts relevant or necessary to resolving the central\n\nissue on appeal, she could have designated them for preparation and production to this\n\ncourt. Ariz. R. Civ. App. P. 11(b)(2), 17B A.R.S.; Orlando v. Northcutt, 103 Ariz. 298,\n\n301, 441 P.2d 58, 61 (1968).\n\n                                               II\n\n¶9            We now turn to Safeway’s argument that the trial court erroneously permitted\n\nLopez to claim and recover for medical expenses that were never paid. As noted earlier,\n\nSafeway relies primarily on Anderson, contending this court’s 1973 decision in that case is\n\n“directly on point,” “dispositive of the question presented” here, and clearly establishes\n\n\n\n       2\n        As Lopez correctly points out, “[r]eversal requires a showing that the alleged error\nwas prejudicial to Safeway’s substantial rights.” See Ariz. R. Evid. 103(a), 17A A.R.S.\n(“Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a\nsubstantial right of the party is affected.”); see also Ariz. Const. art. VI, § 27; Ariz. R. Civ.\nP. 61, 16 A.R.S., Pt. 2; Carter-Glogau Labs., Inc. v. Constr., Prod. & Maint. Laborers’\nLocal 383, 153 Ariz. 351, 358, 736 P.2d 1163, 1170 (App. 1986); but see Hirsh v. Manley,\n81 Ariz. 94, 101, 300 P.2d 588, 593 (1956) (new trial ordered when court could not\ndetermine to what extent jury had been influenced by inadmissible evidence and could not\nsegregate excess damages awarded to plaintiff); Valley Transp. Sys. v. Reinartz, 67 Ariz.\n380, 383, 197 P.2d 269, 271 (1948) (“prejudice [is] presumed to exist where improper\nevidence is admitted upon which the jury might act”). Nonetheless, if Lopez was\nerroneously permitted to claim and recover medical expenses in an amount approximately\n3.5 times greater than what the law allows, we are not persuaded that the trial transcript\nwould be necessary or even helpful in evaluating the question of prejudice here.\n\n                                               6\n\f“that the proper measure of damages for the value of medical services rendered is the\n\ncontractually agreed upon rate.” We find Anderson distinguishable but, to the extent it\n\nsupports the broad proposition Safeway advocates, we overrule that portion of it.\n\n¶10           In Anderson, the plaintiff was injured on his job, received workers’\n\ncompensation benefits, but also filed a third-party personal injury action. In that action,\n\n“[t]he trial court ruled that the [plaintiff’s] doctors could testify as to the amount they\n\nordinarily would have charged for their services which was higher than the actual amount\n\ncharged to and paid by the State Compensation Fund.” 21 Ariz. App. at 28, 515 P.2d at 55.\n\nAdopting the reasoning in Pabon v. Cotton State Mutual Insurance Co., 196 F. Supp. 586\n\n(D.P.R. 1961),3 this court disagreed with the trial court’s ruling and stated: “If on retrial,\n\nit appears that the doctors’ charges were based on a schedule of rates contractually agreed\n\nupon between them and the Fund, then the [plaintiffs] can receive no more than those\n\ncharges.” Anderson, 21 Ariz. App. at 29, 515 P.2d at 56.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        In Pabon, as in Anderson, the plaintiff sustained an on-the-job injury for which he\napparently received workers’ compensation benefits. Similarly, the plaintiff’s physician in\nPabon testified at trial, “he could have reasonably charged [more] for his services” than\nallowed by “the schedule of rates contractually agreed upon between him and the Fund,”\nbut “he never charged or collected” that greater amount. 196 F. Supp. at 588. As Lopez\npoints out, Anderson also arose from a “workers’ compensation setting,” and “the entire\nworkers’ compensation scheme was (and still is) created and controlled entirely by statute.”\nThus, neither Anderson nor Pabon involved the type of situation presented here, where a\npatient benefits from contractually reduced rates for payment of medical expenses by\ncollateral sources procured by or available to the patient.\n\n                                              7\n\f¶11           Although at first blush Anderson would seem to apply to this case, on closer\n\nanalysis it is distinguishable and, therefore, not controlling. There, the State Compensation\n\nFund paid the plaintiff’s healthcare providers the “actual amount charged” by each of them.\n\nId. at 28, 515 P.2d at 55. Thus, as Lopez points out, “the [Anderson] decision stands for\n\nthe proposition that a party cannot recover for medical expenses in excess of the amounts\n\nactually charged (i.e., billed) by healthcare providers,” because “the amount billed in that\n\ncase was identical to the amount paid by the compensation carrier.”\n\n¶12           Here, in contrast, the billing charges of Lopez’s healthcare providers totaled\n\nalmost $59,700, even though the providers accepted only $16,837 in full satisfaction of\n\nthose charges based on reduced rates to which the providers had contractually agreed with\n\nLopez’s medical insurance carriers. At oral argument in this court, Safeway contended the\n\nmedical bills reflecting the higher amount had “nothing to do with anything” because they\n\nwere largely illusory or “phantom.” But, as noted earlier, Safeway stipulated that all of\n\nLopez’s medical bills would “be deemed as reasonable and customary medical expenses”\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\ffor trial purposes.4 In short, we do not find Anderson dispositive; but that does not end our\n\ninquiry.\n\n¶13           At the heart of this appeal is whether the collateral source rule applies to\n\nLopez’s claim for medical expenses that apparently were charged to her but which neither\n\nshe nor her medical insurance carriers had to pay.5 “[T]he collateral source rule,” as our\n\nsupreme court has stated, requires that “‘[p]ayments made to or benefits conferred on the\n\n\n       4\n         Because of that stipulation, the question whether the $16,837 actually paid was, in\nfact, the reasonable value of the medical services rendered was not preserved for appeal.\nAnd, aside from that stipulation, the limited record before us does not shed any additional\nlight on other, potentially relevant issues. For example, from this record we cannot tell\nwhether Lopez had private medical insurance that covered most of her medical expense.\nNor can we tell whether she paid, in the way of premiums or otherwise, for the benefit of\nhealth insurance coverage under which her providers apparently were bound to accept\nadjusted, reduced rates in full payment and satisfaction of their services.\n       5\n        See generally A.R.S. §§ 20-1072, 33-931, 33-934; Blankenbaker v. Jonovich, 205\nAriz. 383, ¶¶ 1, 19, 71 P.3d 910, 911, 915 (2003) (holding that § 33-934 “allows an action\nto enforce a health care provider lien only against those liable to an injured person, not\nagainst the injured person,” but also stating “[t]he provider can always proceed, even in the\nabsence of a lien, against the patient for the value of the services rendered”); cf. Samsel v.\nAllstate Ins. Co., 204 Ariz. 1, ¶¶ 27, 38, 59 P.3d 281, 289, 291 (2002) (under A.R.S. § 20-\n1072, HMO “enrollee is immunized from actions by the [health care] provider for recovery\nof charges for services provided and covered by the enrollee’s agreement with the HMO,”\nincluding “direct action[s] for the difference between the provider’s usual fees or charges\nand the lesser amount payable pursuant to the contract between the provider and the HMO”;\nbut “expenses paid by the HMO coverage [patient/claimant] bought and paid for should be\ntreated [no] differently than expenses paid by a hospital or medical expense policy [she]\nmight have purchased or any other collateral source [she] might have acquired by her own\nefforts”); Nahom v.

S. Pac.\n\nTransp. Co., 130 Ariz. 516, 519, 637 P.2d 726, 729 (1981), quoting Restatement (Second)\n\nof Torts § 920A(2) (1979); see also Hall v. Olague, 119 Ariz. 73, 73, 579 P.2d 577, 577\n\n(App. 1978) (“The so-called ‘collateral source rule’ states that total or partial compensation\n\nfor an injury which the injured party receives from a collateral source wholly independent\n\nof the wrongdoer does not operate to reduce the damages recoverable from the\n\nwrongdoer.”). “The collateral source rule is well established in Arizona tort law.” Michael\n\nv.

As the court in\n\nTaylor explained: “The rationale for this rule is that simply because the injured party might\n\nhave provided by contract for reimbursement of medical expenses, it should not be used to\n\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\flessen the tortfeasor’s liability. There should be no windfall for a tortfeasor because he\n\ninjured an insured instead of a non-insured.” 130 Ariz. at 519-20, 637 P.2d at 729-30.\n\n¶15           “The collateral source rule is most often applied in cases where an injured\n\nparty recovers from a tortfeasor amounts for which plaintiff has already been compensated\n\nby his insurer.” Id. at 519, 637 P.2d at 729; see also Norwest Bank, 197 Ariz. 181, ¶ 36,\n\n3 P.3d at 1109. But the rule also applies when, due to a healthcare provider’s gratuitous\n\ntreatment, a plaintiff neither incurs nor is responsible for payment of the reasonable value\n\nof medical services, but nonetheless can claim and recover compensation for that value from\n\nthe tortfeasor. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. c(3); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Law\n\nof Remedies, § 8.6(3), at 493-94 (2d ed. 1993) (Under the collateral source rule, “gratuitous\n\nbenefits conferred by others . . . do not reduce the defendant’s tort liability, even though the\n\npayments operate to reduce the plaintiff’s loss. . . . The plaintiff has been allowed to recover\n\nfully against the defendant even though the injury has been partly compensated for by\n\ngratuitous donations by third persons, as where . . . he receives free medical treatment.”).\n\n¶16           Not surprisingly, the parties disagree on whether the collateral source rule\n\napplies to the issue presented here, and they point to different sections of the Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts to support their positions.6 Relying on Restatement § 911, comment h,\n\n\n       6\n         Pointing to footnote one in the Anderson decision, which cited “cases[,] Annot. 7\nA.L.R. 3d 516 Damages-Collateral Source Rule,” 21 Ariz. App. at 28 n.1, 515 P.2d at 55\nn.1, Safeway also contends this court was “fully aware of collateral source rule issues” when\nit ruled as it did in that case. As noted above, however, we find Anderson distinguishable\nand, despite the cryptic reference in footnote one of that decision, the court there did not\n\n                                              11\n\fSafeway argues “limiting damages to contractually agreed upon rates is not contrary to the\n\n‘collateral source rule.’” Section 911 is entitled “Value,” a part of the chapter that deals\n\ngenerally with “Damages,” and provides in part: “As used in this Chapter, value means\n\nexchange value or the value to the owner if this is greater than the exchange value.”\n\nRestatement § 911(1). Based on this language, Safeway contends § 911 “is the defining\n\nsection for the term ‘value’ throughout the chapter, including those instances where the term\n\nvalue appears in Sections 920A and 924,” on which Lopez relies.\n\n¶17           In support, Safeway primarily focuses on comment h to § 911, which is\n\nentitled “Value of services rendered” and states in part:\n\n                     When the plaintiff seeks to recover for expenditures\n              made or liability incurred to third persons for services rendered,\n              normally the amount recovered is the reasonable value of the\n              services rather than the amount paid or charged. If, however,\n              the injured person paid less than the exchange rate, he can\n              recover no more than the amount paid, except when the low\n              rate was intended as a gift to him. A person can recover even\n              for an exorbitant amount that he was reasonable in paying in\n              order to avert further harm. (See § 919). (Emphasis added.)\n\nPointing to the italicized language, Safeway maintains that comment is dispositive here and\n\nlimits Lopez’s medical-expense claim to $16,837, the amount her insurers actually paid. See\n\nalso 25 CJS Damages § 153, at 542 (2002) (“Where the amount paid for medical services\n\nis in accordance with a contractual schedule of rates, the recovery is limited to that amount\n\nalthough the reasonable value of the services in the absence of the contract is higher.”).\n\n\n\nanalyze how the argument Safeway makes here might implicate the collateral source rule.\n\n                                             12\n\f¶18           In contrast, Lopez argues § 911 and its comment h are inapplicable because\n\nthey only “pertain[] to suits resulting from fraud or duress or involving mitigation of\n\ndamages.” That argument has some force because the first sentence of comment h states:\n\n“The measure of recovery of a person who sues for the value of his services tortiously\n\nobtained by the defendant’s fraud or duress, or for the value of services rendered in an\n\nattempt to mitigate damages, is the reasonable exchange value of the services at the time and\n\nplace.” Arguably the balance of comment h, including the portion on which Safeway relies,\n\nrefers to that limited context.7 See Bynum v. Magno, 101 P.3d 1149, 1158-60 (Haw. 2004);\n\nRobinson v. Bates, 828 N.E.2d 657, 664-65 (Ohio App. 2005).\n\n¶19           Lopez contends the Restatement provisions that actually apply and support\n\nthe trial court’s ruling are §§ 920A and 924. Restatement § 920A(2), adopted by our\n\nsupreme court in Taylor, 130 Ariz. at 519, 637 P.2d at 729, states: “Payments made to or\n\nbenefits conferred on the injured party from other sources are not credited against the\n\ntortfeasor’s liability, although they cover all or a part of the harm for which the tortfeasor\n\nis liable.” Comment b to that section, entitled “[b]enefits from collateral sources,” states:\n\n\n\n                     Payments made or benefits conferred by other sources\n              are known as collateral-source benefits. They do not have the\n              effect of reducing the recovery against the defendant. The\n\n\n       7\n       As Safeway points out, a citation to Restatement § 919 appears at the end of\ncomment h. That section, however, relates to mitigation of damages, a scenario specifically\nmentioned in the first sentence of comment h and not at issue here.\n\n                                             13\n\f              injured party’s net loss may have been reduced correspondingly,\n              and to the extent that the defendant is required to pay the total\n              amount there may be a double compensation for a part of the\n              plaintiff’s injury. But it is the position of the law that a benefit\n              that is directed to the injured party should not be shifted so as\n              to become a windfall for the tortfeasor. If the plaintiff was\n              himself responsible for the benefit, as by maintaining his own\n              insurance or by making advantageous employment\n              arrangements, the law allows him to keep it for himself. If the\n              benefit was a gift to the plaintiff from a third party or\n              established for him by law, he should not be deprived of the\n              advantage that it confers. The law does not differentiate\n              between the nature of the benefits, so long as they did not come\n              from the defendant or a person acting for him. One way of\n              stating this conclusion is to say that it is the tortfeasor’s\n              responsibility to compensate for all harm that he causes, not\n              confined to the net loss that the injured party receives.\n\n¶20           Similarly, Restatement § 924, which is entitled “Harm to the Person” and\n\nfound under the topic heading of “Compensatory Damages for Specific Types of Harm,”\n\nprovides that a tort victim may recover damages for “reasonable medical and other\n\nexpenses.”8 Much like the collateral source rule, comment f to § 924 states in part:\n\n                      The injured person is entitled to damages for all expenses\n              and for the value of services reasonably made necessary by the\n              harm. . . . The value of medical services made necessary by the\n              tort can ordinarily be recovered although they have created no\n              liability or expense to the injured person, as when a physician\n              donates his services. (See § 920A).\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         Consistent with that provision, the trial court instructed the jurors that if they found\nSafeway liable, they should “decide the full amount of money that will reasonably and fairly\ncompensate” Lopez for her damages, including “reasonable expenses of necessary medical\ncare, treatment, and services rendered.”\n\n                                               14\n\fSee also Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 396, at 358 (2003) (generally, “a plaintiff who has been\n\ninjured by the tortious conduct of the defendant is entitled to recover the reasonable value\n\nof medical and nursing services reasonably required by the injury,” and “recovery is not\n\nnecessarily limited to expenditures actually made or obligations incurred for medical care”).\n\n¶21            In our view, although these various Restatement provisions overlap and\n\narguably conflict, Restatement §§ 920A and 924 are more specific and directly applicable\n\nto the issue presented here. Cf. City of Phoenix v. Superior Court, 139 Ariz. 175, 178, 677\n\nP.2d 1283, 1286 (1984) (“special or specific statutory provisions will usually control over\n\nthose that are general”). In fact, several courts have recognized that those Restatement\n\nsections, rather than § 911, are applicable to cases such as this. See, e.g., Bynum, 101 P.3d\n\nat 1159-60; Robinson, 828 N.E.2d at 664-65; see also Amlotte v. United States, 292\n\nF. Supp. 2d 922, 927-28 (E.D. Mich. 2003); Fye v. Kennedy, 991 S.W.2d 754, 763 (Tenn.\n\nApp. 1998); Koffman v. Leichtfuss, 630 N.W.2d 201, 209-10 (Wis. 2001). But, to the\n\nextent § 911 and its comment h support Safeway’s position, we decline to follow them. See\n\nRamirez v. Health Partners of S. Ariz., 193 Ariz. 325, ¶ 26, 972 P.2d 658, 665 (App. 1998)\n\n(although Arizona courts generally follow Restatement if no controlling statute or case on\n\nthe subject exists, “we will not do so blindly,” but rather, “must consider whether the\n\nRestatement position, as applied to a particular claim, is logical, furthers the interests of\n\njustice, is consistent with Arizona law and policy, and has been generally acknowledged\n\nelsewhere”).\n\n\n                                             15\n\f¶22           The parties also rely on several out-of-state cases to support their respective\n\npositions. Safeway relies primarily on Moorhead v. Crozer Chester Medical Center, 765\n\nA.2d 786 (Pa. 2001), and Hanif v. Housing Authority, 246 Cal. Rptr. 192 (Cal. App.\n\n1988). In Moorhead, “[t]he fair and reasonable value of the medical services rendered” to\n\nthe patient was approximately $108,668, but the Medicare allowance for those services was\n\nonly $12,167. 765 A.2d at 788. Plaintiffs sought recovery of the full $108,668, even\n\nthough, as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted, she “never was and never will be legally\n\nobligated to pay more than $12,167.40 for the medical services.” Id. That court concluded\n\nplaintiff was only “entitled to the amount actually paid,” and therefore could not collect the\n\nadditional amount of approximately $96,500. Id. at 789. In so ruling, the court relied in\n\npart on Restatement § 911, comment h, and stated:\n\n              [W]here, as here, the exact amount of expenses has been\n              established by contract and those expenses have been satisfied,\n              there is no longer any issue as to the amount of expenses for\n              which the plaintiff will be liable. In the latter case, the injured\n              party should be limited to recovering the amount paid for the\n              medical services . . . .\n\n                     ....\n\n                      Awarding [plaintiff] the additional amount of $96,500.91\n              would provide her with a windfall and would violate\n              fundamental tenets of just compensation. It is a basic principle\n              of tort law that “damages are to be compensatory to the full\n              extent of the injury sustained, but the award should be limited\n              to compensation and compensation alone.” [Plaintiff] never\n              has, and never will, incur the $96,500.91 sum from [defendant]\n              as an expense. We discern no principled basis upon which to\n              justify awarding that additional amount.\n\n                                              16\n\f                     ....\n\n                     Clearly, [plaintiff] is entitled to recover $12,167.40, the\n              amount which was paid on her behalf by Medicare and Blue\n              Cross, the collateral sources. But the essential point to\n              recognize is that [defendant] is not seeking to diminish\n              [plaintiff’s] recovery by this amount. Rather, the issue is\n              whether [plaintiff] is entitled to collect the additional amount\n              of $96,500.91 as an expense. [Plaintiff] did not pay\n              $96,500.91, nor did Medicare or Blue Cross pay that amount\n              on her behalf. The collateral source rule does not apply to the\n              illusory “charge” of $96,500.91 since that amount was not paid\n              by any collateral source.\n\nId. at 789-91 (citations omitted).\n\n¶23           Applying similar reasoning, the California Court of Appeals previously\n\nconcluded in Hanif that the proper measure of damages is the amount actually paid for\n\nmedical services pursuant to a contractually agreed-upon rate, rather than the face amount\n\nof original billings. As that court stated:\n\n              The question here involves the application of that measure, i.e.,\n              whether the “reasonable value” measure of recovery means that\n              an injured plaintiff may recover from the tortfeasor more than\n              the actual amount he paid or for which he incurred liability for\n              past medical care and services. Fundamental principles\n              underlying recovery of compensatory damages in tort actions\n              compel the following answer: no.\n\nHanif, 246 Cal. Rptr. at 194-95; see also Nishihama v. City and County of San Francisco,\n\n112 Cal. Rptr. 2d 861, 866-67 (Cal. App. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f¶24           But, as Lopez points out, those cases represent a distinct minority view and\n\nhave not been followed by other courts.9 A majority of courts have concluded, contrary to\n\nMoorhead and Hanif, that plaintiffs are entitled to claim and recover the full amount of\n\nreasonable medical expenses charged, based on the reasonable value of medical services\n\nrendered, including amounts written off from the bills pursuant to contractual rate\n\nreductions. See, e.g., Lindholm v. Hassan, 369 F. Supp. 2d 1104, 1110 (D.S.D. 2005);\n\nMitchell v. Haldar, 883 A.2d 32, 40 (Del. 2005); Hardi v. Mezzanotte, 818 A.2d 974, 985\n\n(D.C. 2003); Olariu v. Marrero, 549 S.E.2d 121, 123 (Ga. Ct. App. 2001); Bynum, 101\n\nP.3d at 1160-62; Arthur v. Catour, 803 N.E.2d 647, 650 (Ill. App. 2004); Bozeman v.\n\nLouisiana, 879 So. 2d 692, 705-06 (La. 2004); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Frierson, 818\n\nSo. 2d 1135, 1139-40 (Miss. 2002); Brown v. Van Noy, 879 S.W.2d 667, 676 (Mo. App.\n\n1994); Robinson, 828 N.E.2d at 673; Haselden v. Davis, 579 S.E.2d 293, 294 (S.C. 2003);\n\nAcuar v. Letourneau, 531 S.E.2d 316, 322 (Va. 2000); Koffman, 630 N.W.2d at 208.\n\n¶25           These courts have decided that, for purposes of the collateral source rule, no\n\nrational distinction exists between payments made by an insurance carrier on behalf of an\n\n\n       9\n        In addition, as Professor Dobbs has observed: “If confined to their facts, both [Hanif\nand Moorhead ] could be interpreted narrowly. Hanif involved a Medi-Cal (Medicaid)\npublic assistance plaintiff and might be limited to such cases.” 2 Dan B. Dobbs, The Law\nof Torts, § 380 (Supp. 2005), at 134 n.23.25. And, he notes, in Moorhead “the tortfeasor\nand the health care provider were in fact the same.” Id. at 134 n.23.35; see also Hardi v.\nMezzanotte, 818 A.2d 974, 985 (D.C. 2003) (“[r]egardless of any broad language in the\nopinion in Moorhead, that case involved medical services provided by the tortfeasor itself\nso that an application of the collateral source rule would have required, in effect, double\npayment”).\n\n                                             18\n\finjured plaintiff, see Brown, 879 S.W.2d at 676; a healthcare provider’s acceptance of\n\nreduced payments from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and government payors,\n\nsee Mitchell, 883 A.2d at 40; or a provider’s write-off of portions of billed charges to\n\npatients pursuant to contractual relationships with HMOs or government payors. See Acuar,\n\n531 S.E.2d at 322.10 Illustrative of this view is Acuar, in which the Virginia Supreme Court\n\nstated:\n\n               [Defendant] contends that the collateral source rule is not\n               applicable to the present case because [plaintiff] is not, and\n               never will be, legally obligated to pay those portions of his\n               medical bills that were written off, nor were those amounts paid\n               on his behalf. According to [defendant], the amounts written\n               off by health care providers are not benefits derived from a\n               collateral source, and to allow [plaintiff] to recover such\n               amounts as damages in this tort action would create a double\n               recovery or windfall in his favor.\n\n                      ....\n\n                      . . . That argument overlooks the fundamental purpose of\n               the [collateral source] rule, explained above, to prevent a\n               tortfeasor from deriving any benefit from compensation or\n               indemnity that an injured party has received from a collateral\n               source. In other words, the focal point of the collateral source\n               rule is not whether an injured party has “incurred” certain\n               medical expenses. Rather, it is whether a tort victim has\n               received benefits from a collateral source that cannot be used to\n               reduce the amount of damages owed by a tortfeasor.\n\n\n\n        In addition, as noted in ¶ 15, supra, “a plaintiff could recover from a tortfeasor for\n          10\n\nthe reasonable value of medical services provided even if those services were provided\ngratuitously.” Mitchell v. Haldar, 883 A.2d 32, 38 (Del. 2005). Safeway does not explain\nhow that type of “gift” scenario, in which a claimant can recover for charges never incurred\nor even billed, differs in any material way from the situation presented here.\n\n                                              19\n\f                    [Plaintiff] is entitled to seek full compensation from\n             [defendant]. Based on the cases cited above dealing with the\n             collateral source rule, we conclude that [defendant] cannot\n             deduct from that full compensation any part of the benefits\n             [plaintiff] received from his contractual arrangement with his\n             health insurance carrier, whether those benefits took the form\n             of medical expense payments or amounts written off because of\n             agreements between his health insurance carrier and his health\n             care providers. Those amounts written off are as much of a\n             benefit for which [plaintiff] paid consideration as are the actual\n             cash payments made by his health insurance carrier to the\n             health care providers. The portions of medical expenses that\n             health care providers write off constitute “compensation or\n             indemnity received by a tort victim from a source collateral to\n             the tortfeasor . . . .”\n\n                    This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of\n             compensatory damages, which is to make a tort victim whole.\n             However, the injured party should be made whole by the\n             tortfeasor, not by a combination of compensation from the\n             tortfeasor and collateral sources. The wrongdoer cannot reap\n             the benefit of a contract for which the wrongdoer paid no\n             compensation. The extent of [defendant’s] liability to [plaintiff]\n             cannot be “measured by deducting financial benefits received by\n             [plaintiff] from collateral sources.” In other words, “it is the\n             tortfeasor’s responsibility to compensate for all harm that he [or\n             she] causes, not confined to the net loss that the injured party\n             receives.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. b\n             (1977).\n\n                    To the extent that such a result provides a windfall to the\n             injured party, we have previously recognized that consequence\n             and concluded that the victim of the wrong rather than the\n             wrongdoer should receive the windfall.\n\n531 S.E.2d at 321-23 (citations omitted); see also Radvany v. Davis, 551 S.E.2d 347, 348\n\n(Va. 2001) (“Payments made to a medical provider by an insurance carrier on behalf of an\n\ninsured and amounts accepted by medical providers are one and the same. Regardless of\n\n                                            20\n\fthe label used, they are payments made by a collateral source and, thus, are not admissible\n\nin evidence for that reason.”).\n\n¶26           We find the reasoning in Acuar sound and consistent with Arizona’s broad\n\napplication of the collateral source rule and the clear majority view.11 Therefore, we hold\n\nthat Lopez was entitled to claim and recover the full amount of her reasonable medical\n\nexpenses for which she was charged, without any reduction for the amounts apparently\n\nwritten off by her healthcare providers pursuant to contractually agreed-upon rates with her\n\nmedical insurance carriers. As this court has stated, the collateral source rule\n\n              is an attempt to resolve a basic conflict between two guiding\n              principles of tort law, namely, (1) the limitation of\n              compensation to the injured party to the amount necessary to\n              make him whole and (2) the avoidance of a windfall to the\n\n\n\n       11\n        Recognizing that majority view, Professor Dobbs states:\n\n                      Because the provider who writes off the balance usually\n              does so in compliance with terms of a contract with the insurer\n              or Medicare, it is possible to conceptualize the write-off as a\n              collateral source benefit paid for by way of the insurer’s\n              contractual agreement with the provider. Alternatively, some\n              courts have said that whether or not the write-off is a true\n              collateral source situation, the rationale and policy behind the\n              collateral source rules, statutory or common law, apply. . . . In\n              line with the basic measure of damages—the reasonable value\n              of the medical services rendered—most courts passing on the\n              issue in recent years have made rulings that permit the plaintiff\n              to prove all of the reasonable medical charges, even though\n              some of those charges were waived by the provider.\n\n2 Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, § 380 (Supp. 2005), at 132-33.\n\n                                             21\n\f               tortfeasor if a choice must be made between him and the injured\n               party.\n\nHall, 119 Ariz. at 74, 579 P.2d at 578; see also Mitchell, 883 A.2d at 38. “‘Because the\n\nlaw must sanction one windfall and deny the other, it favors the victim of the wrong rather\n\nthan the wrongdoer.’” Acuar, 531 S.E.2d at 323, quoting Schickling v. Aspinall, 369\n\nS.E.2d 172, 174 (Va. 1988).\n\n¶27            This court has recognized, however, that “commentators have generally\n\nopposed the rule.” Hall, 119 Ariz. at 74 n.1, 579 P.2d at 578 n.1 (citing articles); see also\n\nEastin v. Broomfield, 116 Ariz. 576, 583, 570 P.2d 744, 751 (1977) (“The validity of these\n\nrationales [in support of the collateral source rule] has been questioned by commentators\n\n. . . . In a day of increased insurance protection, this rule has allowed plaintiffs to effectuate\n\ndouble and even triple recovery as a result of injuries received by them.”); 2 Dan B. Dobbs,\n\nLaw of Remedies, § 8.6(3), at 496 (2d ed. 1993) (“[I]f the collateral source rule were\n\nabolished, the plaintiff will have paid for security and not for the opportunity of a double\n\nrecovery. He has paid for more only because the law, by allowing double recovery, in effect\n\nrequires him to pay for more.”); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, § 380, at 1059 (2001)\n\n(“Considering the matter prospectively rather than after the fact, it may well be that\n\ncompensation could be more cheaply secured without the collateral source rule.”).\n\n¶28            We also recognize that the legislature is free to limit or abandon the collateral\n\nsource rule in various areas, as it did in the medical malpractice arena. See A.R.S. § 12-565\n\n(permitting medical malpractice defendant to introduce evidence of collateral source\n\n                                               22\n\fpayments, which the trier then may consider in assessing damages); see also Eastin, 116\n\nAriz. at 584, 570 P.2d at 752 (upholding constitutionality of § 12-565 and stating, “[w]e\n\nbelieve that the legislature has the right to abolish the collateral source rule as it affects\n\nmedical malpractice cases just as it has done in the workmen’s compensation field”); Goble\n\nv. Frohman, 901 So. 2d 830, 833 (Fla. 2005) (contractual discounts, representing difference\n\nbetween amounts billed by claimant’s healthcare providers and amounts paid to them\n\npursuant to fee schedules in contracts between healthcare providers and HMO, fit within\n\nstatutory definition of “collateral sources”; therefore, amount of contractual discounts, for\n\nwhich no right of reimbursement or subrogation existed, was amount that should be set off\n\nagainst award of compensatory damages to plaintiff). But, absent any such limiting statute\n\nor supreme court authority suggesting that the collateral source rule does not control in a\n\nsituation such as that presented here, we join with the majority of courts in finding it\n\napplicable.\n\n                                             III\n\n¶29           In sum, the trial court did not err in denying Safeway’s pretrial motion in\n\nlimine. Likewise, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Safeway’s motion for new\n\ntrial, which re-urged the same argument made in its pretrial motion. See Larsen v. Decker,\n\n196 Ariz. 239, ¶ 27, 995 P.2d 281, 286 (App. 2000) (we review denial of motion for new\n\ntrial for manifest abuse of discretion). Therefore, the trial court’s judgment and its order\n\ndenying the motion for new trial are affirmed.\n\n\n                                             23\n\f                                            ____________________________________\n                                            JOHN PELANDER, Chief Judge\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n\n____________________________________\nPHILIP G.

Safeway argues the trial court erroneously denied Safeway’s motion in\n\nlimine and, as a result, erred in admitting a summary of Lopez’s medical expenses, which\n\nincluded amounts not actually owed or paid by her or anyone else. Finding no reversible\n\nerror, we affirm.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n¶2            Although no trial transcripts have been furnished to this court, it appears\n\nundisputed that Lopez slipped and fell while entering a Safeway store and sustained various\n\ninjuries. She then filed this negligence action against Safeway. Before trial, Safeway moved\n\nin limine to prohibit Lopez from presenting evidence “reflecting charges for medical care,\n\nhealthcare or psychological care, which charges are above or beyond what was actually\n\naccepted by the healthcare provider in satisfaction of billings.” Based on information\n\nprovided by Lopez, Safeway pointed out that, although Lopez’s medical bills totaled\n\napproximately $59,700, more than $42,000 of that total was “completely written off as\n\nadjustments” and the remaining balance of $16,837 was fully satisfied through contractually\n\nagreed-upon payments. In its motion, Safeway argued Lopez should only be able to claim\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand present evidence on the $16,837, the amount “actually accepted in full satisfaction of\n\nthe services rendered.”\n\n¶3            After considering the parties’ memoranda and hearing oral argument, the trial\n\ncourt denied Safeway’s motion in limine. Thereafter, Lopez’s medical expense summary,\n\nreflecting total medical bills of $59,699.57, was admitted into evidence at trial. The jury\n\nfound in favor of Lopez, awarded damages of $400,000, but found her ten percent at fault\n\nand Safeway ninety percent at fault. This appeal followed the trial court’s entry of judgment\n\non the verdict and subsequent denial of Safeway’s motion for a new trial.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                                               I\n\n¶4            Safeway argues “[t]he trial court’s pretrial ruling on [Safeway’s] Motion in\n\nLimine and the subsequent submission of full medical bills constitute reversible error\n\nrequiring a retrial.” Relying primarily on Anderson v. Muniz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451914\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451914/anderson-v-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.

First, as she points out, the parties stipulated in their joint pretrial statement\n\n\n                                               3\n\f“that the medical bills incurred by the Plaintiff, as itemized on a Summary Sheet of Medical\n\nExpenses, will be deemed as reasonable and customary medical expenses to the extent of\n\nthe Court’s ruling on the Defendant’s Motion in Limine . . . , as to the amount of medical\n\nbills that will be admissible.” Lopez suggests, without response by Safeway in its reply\n\nbrief, that “the foregoing stipulation seems to have mooted the issue now raised on appeal.”\n\nWe disagree.\n\n¶6             The apparent purpose of the stipulation was merely to ease the burden, or\n\nexpedite the process, of introducing Lopez’s medical expenses into evidence at trial once the\n\ntrial court ruled on the legal issue presented in Safeway’s motion in limine.1 The pretrial\n\nstatement does not manifest any intent that the court’s ruling on that motion would be\n\nbinding or otherwise unchallengeable on appeal. Nor did Lopez so argue at the hearing on\n\nSafeway’s motion in limine or, more importantly, in response to Safeway’s subsequent\n\nmotion for new trial. And the trial court did not cite or rely on the parties’ pretrial statement\n\nin denying Safeway’s motion for new trial. Therefore, we find Safeway’s substantive issue\n\non appeal neither moot nor waived. See Pavlik v. Chinle Unified Sch. Dist. No. 24, 195\n\n\n\n       1\n         In its motion in limine, Safeway stated “the parties could stipulate to the damages\nonce the court has entered its In Limine Ruling regarding the ‘phantom’ medical expenses.”\nSimilarly, at oral argument on that motion, held after the parties filed their joint pretrial\nstatement, Safeway’s counsel explained: “The game plan I have agreed to, stipulated to, is\nthat we are going to have you [the trial judge] decide the issue, and then either the jury is\ngoing to get this set of medical expenses or this set.” These statements place in context the\nstipulation made in the joint pretrial statement and do not reflect any intent to abandon the\nlegal issue raised in the motion in limine once the trial court had ruled on it.\n\n                                               </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 28, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265077\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265077/pavlik-v-chinle-unified/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 640 (App. 1999) (by failing to raise waiver as a defense in\n\nthe trial court, defendant “waived its waiver argument”).\n\n¶7            Second, Lopez argues Safeway’s failure to provide the trial transcript makes\n\nit “impossible to analyze or decide any issues raised on this appeal.” Again, we disagree.\n\nAlthough Lopez questions how we can determine “whether Safeway’s objections [to her\n\nmedical expense claim] were properly made and preserved,” the record includes Safeway’s\n\nmotion in limine, the transcript of the argument on that motion, and the trial court’s ruling.\n\nBased on that ruling, the court later admitted Lopez’s medical expense summary into\n\nevidence at trial. Safeway’s pretrial motion preserved its objection to the amount of medical\n\nexpense Lopez could claim and recover. See State v.

As noted earlier,\n\nSafeway relies primarily on Anderson, contending this court’s 1973 decision in that case is\n\n“directly on point,” “dispositive of the question presented” here, and clearly establishes\n\n\n\n       2\n        As Lopez correctly points out, “[r]eversal requires a showing that the alleged error\nwas prejudicial to Safeway’s substantial rights.” See Ariz.

Nonetheless, if Lopez was\nerroneously permitted to claim and recover medical expenses in an amount approximately\n3.5 times greater than what the law allows, we are not persuaded that the trial transcript\nwould be necessary or even helpful in evaluating the question of prejudice here.\n\n                                               6\n\f“that the proper measure of damages for the value of medical services rendered is the\n\ncontractually agreed upon rate.” We find Anderson distinguishable but, to the extent it\n\nsupports the broad proposition Safeway advocates, we overrule that portion of it.\n\n¶10           In Anderson, the plaintiff was injured on his job, received workers’\n\ncompensation benefits, but also filed a third-party personal injury action. In that action,\n\n“[t]he trial court ruled that the [plaintiff’s] doctors could testify as to the amount they\n\nordinarily would have charged for their services which was higher than the actual amount\n\ncharged to and paid by the State Compensation Fund.” 21 Ariz.

App. at 29, 515 P.2d at 56.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        In Pabon, as in Anderson, the plaintiff sustained an on-the-job injury for which he\napparently received workers’ compensation benefits. Similarly, the plaintiff’s physician in\nPabon testified at trial, “he could have reasonably charged [more] for his services” than\nallowed by “the schedule of rates contractually agreed upon between him and the Fund,”\nbut “he never charged or collected” that greater amount. 196 F. Supp. at 588. As Lopez\npoints out, Anderson also arose from a “workers’ compensation setting,” and “the entire\nworkers’ compensation scheme was (and still is) created and controlled entirely by statute.”\nThus, neither Anderson nor Pabon involved the type of situation presented here, where a\npatient benefits from contractually reduced rates for payment of medical expenses by\ncollateral sources procured by or available to the patient.\n\n                                              7\n\f¶11           Although at first blush Anderson would seem to apply to this case, on closer\n\nanalysis it is distinguishable and, therefore, not controlling. There, the State Compensation\n\nFund paid the plaintiff’s healthcare providers the “actual amount charged” by each of them.\n\nId. at 28, 515 P.2d at 55. Thus, as Lopez points out, “the [Anderson] decision stands for\n\nthe proposition that a party cannot recover for medical expenses in excess of the amounts\n\nactually charged (i.e., billed) by healthcare providers,” because “the amount billed in that\n\ncase was identical to the amount paid by the compensation carrier.”\n\n¶12           Here, in contrast, the billing charges of Lopez’s healthcare providers totaled\n\nalmost $59,700, even though the providers accepted only $16,837 in full satisfaction of\n\nthose charges based on reduced rates to which the providers had contractually agreed with\n\nLopez’s medical insurance carriers. At oral argument in this court, Safeway contended the\n\nmedical bills reflecting the higher amount had “nothing to do with anything” because they\n\nwere largely illusory or “phantom.” But, as noted earlier, Safeway stipulated that all of\n\nLopez’s medical bills would “be deemed as reasonable and customary medical expenses”\n\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\ffor trial purposes.4 In short, we do not find Anderson dispositive; but that does not end our\n\ninquiry.\n\n¶13           At the heart of this appeal is whether the collateral source rule applies to\n\nLopez’s claim for medical expenses that apparently were charged to her but which neither\n\nshe nor her medical insurance carriers had to pay.5 “[T]he collateral source rule,” as our\n\nsupreme court has stated, requires that “‘[p]ayments made to or benefits conferred on the\n\n\n       4\n         Because of that stipulation, the question whether the $16,837 actually paid was, in\nfact, the reasonable value of the medical services rendered was not preserved for appeal.\nAnd, aside from that stipulation, the limited record before us does not shed any additional\nlight on other, potentially relevant issues. For example, from this record we cannot tell\nwhether Lopez had private medical insurance that covered most of her medical expense.\nNor can we tell whether she paid, in the way of premiums or otherwise, for the benefit of\nhealth insurance coverage under which her providers apparently were bound to accept\nadjusted, reduced rates in full payment and satisfaction of their services.\n       5\n        See generally A.R.S. §§ 20-1072, 33-931, 33-934; Blankenbaker v.

But the rule also applies when, due to a healthcare provider’s gratuitous\n\ntreatment, a plaintiff neither incurs nor is responsible for payment of the reasonable value\n\nof medical services, but nonetheless can claim and recover compensation for that value from\n\nthe tortfeasor. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. c(3); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Law\n\nof Remedies, § 8.6(3), at 493-94 (2d ed. 1993) (Under the collateral source rule, “gratuitous\n\nbenefits conferred by others . . . do not reduce the defendant’s tort liability, even though the\n\npayments operate to reduce the plaintiff’s loss. . . . The plaintiff has been allowed to recover\n\nfully against the defendant even though the injury has been partly compensated for by\n\ngratuitous donations by third persons, as where . . . he receives free medical treatment.”).\n\n¶16           Not surprisingly, the parties disagree on whether the collateral source rule\n\napplies to the issue presented here, and they point to different sections of the Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts to support their positions.6 Relying on Restatement § 911, comment h,\n\n\n       6\n         Pointing to footnote one in the Anderson decision, which cited “cases[,] Annot. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> Damages-Collateral Source Rule,” 21 Ariz. App. at 28 n.1, 515 P.2d at 55\nn.1, Safeway also contends this court was “fully aware of collateral source rule issues” when\nit ruled as it did in that case. As noted above, however, we find Anderson distinguishable\nand, despite the cryptic reference in footnote one of that decision, the court there did not\n\n                                              11\n\fSafeway argues “limiting damages to contractually agreed upon rates is not contrary to the\n\n‘collateral source rule.’” Section 911 is entitled “Value,” a part of the chapter that deals\n\ngenerally with “Damages,” and provides in part: “As used in this Chapter, value means\n\nexchange value or the value to the owner if this is greater than the exchange value.”\n\nRestatement § 911(1). Based on this language, Safeway contends § 911 “is the defining\n\nsection for the term ‘value’ throughout the chapter, including those instances where the term\n\nvalue appears in Sections 920A and 924,” on which Lopez relies.\n\n¶17           In support, Safeway primarily focuses on comment h to § 911, which is\n\nentitled “Value of services rendered” and states in part:\n\n                     When the plaintiff seeks to recover for expenditures\n              made or liability incurred to third persons for services rendered,\n              normally the amount recovered is the reasonable value of the\n              services rather than the amount paid or charged. If, however,\n              the injured person paid less than the exchange rate, he can\n              recover no more than the amount paid, except when the low\n              rate was intended as a gift to him. A person can recover even\n              for an exorbitant amount that he was reasonable in paying in\n              order to avert further harm. (See § 919). (Emphasis added.)\n\nPointing to the italicized language, Safeway maintains that comment is dispositive here and\n\nlimits Lopez’s medical-expense claim to $16,837, the amount her insurers actually paid. See\n\nalso 25 CJS Damages § 153, at 542 (2002) (“Where the amount paid for medical services\n\nis in accordance with a contractual schedule of rates, the recovery is limited to that amount\n\nalthough the reasonable value of the services in the absence of the contract is higher.”).\n\n\n\nanalyze how the argument Safeway makes here might implicate the collateral source rule.\n\n                                             12\n\f¶18           In contrast, Lopez argues § 911 and its comment h are inapplicable because\n\nthey only “pertain[] to suits resulting from fraud or duress or involving mitigation of\n\ndamages.” That argument has some force because the first sentence of comment h states:\n\n“The measure of recovery of a person who sues for the value of his services tortiously\n\nobtained by the defendant’s fraud or duress, or for the value of services rendered in an\n\nattempt to mitigate damages, is the reasonable exchange value of the services at the time and\n\nplace.” Arguably the balance of comment h, including the portion on which Safeway relies,\n\nrefers to that limited context.7 See Bynum v. Magno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508181\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508181/bynum-v-magno/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1158-60 (Haw. 2004);\n\nRobinson v.

Restatement § 920A(2), adopted by our\n\nsupreme court in Taylor, 130 Ariz. at 519, 637 P.2d at 729, states: “Payments made to or\n\nbenefits conferred on the injured party from other sources are not credited against the\n\ntortfeasor’s liability, although they cover all or a part of the harm for which the tortfeasor\n\nis liable.” Comment b to that section, entitled “[b]enefits from collateral sources,” states:\n\n\n\n                     Payments made or benefits conferred by other sources\n              are known as collateral-source benefits. They do not have the\n              effect of reducing the recovery against the defendant. The\n\n\n       7\n       As Safeway points out, a citation to Restatement § 919 appears at the end of\ncomment h. That section, however, relates to mitigation of damages, a scenario specifically\nmentioned in the first sentence of comment h and not at issue here.\n\n                                             13\n\f              injured party’s net loss may have been reduced correspondingly,\n              and to the extent that the defendant is required to pay the total\n              amount there may be a double compensation for a part of the\n              plaintiff’s injury. But it is the position of the law that a benefit\n              that is directed to the injured party should not be shifted so as\n              to become a windfall for the tortfeasor. If the plaintiff was\n              himself responsible for the benefit, as by maintaining his own\n              insurance or by making advantageous employment\n              arrangements, the law allows him to keep it for himself. If the\n              benefit was a gift to the plaintiff from a third party or\n              established for him by law, he should not be deprived of the\n              advantage that it confers. The law does not differentiate\n              between the nature of the benefits, so long as they did not come\n              from the defendant or a person acting for him. One way of\n              stating this conclusion is to say that it is the tortfeasor’s\n              responsibility to compensate for all harm that he causes, not\n              confined to the net loss that the injured party receives.\n\n¶20           Similarly, Restatement § 924, which is entitled “Harm to the Person” and\n\nfound under the topic heading of “Compensatory Damages for Specific Types of Harm,”\n\nprovides that a tort victim may recover damages for “reasonable medical and other\n\nexpenses.”8 Much like the collateral source rule, comment f to § 924 states in part:\n\n                      The injured person is entitled to damages for all expenses\n              and for the value of services reasonably made necessary by the\n              harm. . . . The value of medical services made necessary by the\n              tort can ordinarily be recovered although they have created no\n              liability or expense to the injured person, as when a physician\n              donates his services. (See § 920A).\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         Consistent with that provision, the trial court instructed the jurors that if they found\nSafeway liable, they should “decide the full amount of money that will reasonably and fairly\ncompensate” Lopez for her damages, including “reasonable expenses of necessary medical\ncare, treatment, and services rendered.”\n\n                                               14\n\fSee also Am. Jur. 2d Damages § 396, at 358 (2003) (generally, “a plaintiff who has been\n\ninjured by the tortious conduct of the defendant is entitled to recover the reasonable value\n\nof medical and nursing services reasonably required by the injury,” and “recovery is not\n\nnecessarily limited to expenditures actually made or obligations incurred for medical care”).\n\n¶21            In our view, although these various Restatement provisions overlap and\n\narguably conflict, Restatement §§ 920A and 924 are more specific and directly applicable\n\nto the issue presented here.

In Moorhead, “[t]he fair and reasonable value of the medical services rendered” to\n\nthe patient was approximately $108,668, but the Medicare allowance for those services was\n\nonly $12,167. 765 A.2d at 788. Plaintiffs sought recovery of the full $108,668, even\n\nthough, as the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted, she “never was and never will be legally\n\nobligated to pay more than $12,167.40 for the medical services.” Id. That court concluded\n\nplaintiff was only “entitled to the amount actually paid,” and therefore could not collect the\n\nadditional amount of approximately $96,500. Id. at 789. In so ruling, the court relied in\n\npart on Restatement § 911, comment h, and stated:\n\n              [W]here, as here, the exact amount of expenses has been\n              established by contract and those expenses have been satisfied,\n              there is no longer any issue as to the amount of expenses for\n              which the plaintiff will be liable. In the latter case, the injured\n              party should be limited to recovering the amount paid for the\n              medical services . . . .\n\n                     ....\n\n                      Awarding [plaintiff] the additional amount of $96,500.91\n              would provide her with a windfall and would violate\n              fundamental tenets of just compensation. It is a basic principle\n              of tort law that “damages are to be compensatory to the full\n              extent of the injury sustained, but the award should be limited\n              to compensation and compensation alone.” [Plaintiff] never\n              has, and never will, incur the $96,500.91 sum from [defendant]\n              as an expense. We discern no principled basis upon which to\n              justify awarding that additional amount.\n\n                                              16\n\f                     ....\n\n                     Clearly, [plaintiff] is entitled to recover $12,167.40, the\n              amount which was paid on her behalf by Medicare and Blue\n              Cross, the collateral sources. But the essential point to\n              recognize is that [defendant] is not seeking to diminish\n              [plaintiff’s] recovery by this amount. Rather, the issue is\n              whether [plaintiff] is entitled to collect the additional amount\n              of $96,500.91 as an expense. [Plaintiff] did not pay\n              $96,500.91, nor did Medicare or Blue Cross pay that amount\n              on her behalf. The collateral source rule does not apply to the\n              illusory “charge” of $96,500.91 since that amount was not paid\n              by any collateral source.\n\nId. at 789-91 (citations omitted).\n\n¶23           Applying similar reasoning, the California Court of Appeals previously\n\nconcluded in Hanif that the proper measure of damages is the amount actually paid for\n\nmedical services pursuant to a contractually agreed-upon rate, rather than the face amount\n\nof original billings. As that court stated:\n\n              The question here involves the application of that measure, i.e.,\n              whether the “reasonable value” measure of recovery means that\n              an injured plaintiff may recover from the tortfeasor more than\n              the actual amount he paid or for which he incurred liability for\n              past medical care and services. Fundamental principles\n              underlying recovery of compensatory damages in tort actions\n              compel the following answer: no.\n\nHanif, 246 Cal.

See Acuar,\n\n531 S.E.2d at 322.10 Illustrative of this view is Acuar, in which the Virginia Supreme Court\n\nstated:\n\n               [Defendant] contends that the collateral source rule is not\n               applicable to the present case because [plaintiff] is not, and\n               never will be, legally obligated to pay those portions of his\n               medical bills that were written off, nor were those amounts paid\n               on his behalf. According to [defendant], the amounts written\n               off by health care providers are not benefits derived from a\n               collateral source, and to allow [plaintiff] to recover such\n               amounts as damages in this tort action would create a double\n               recovery or windfall in his favor.\n\n                      ....\n\n                      . . . That argument overlooks the fundamental purpose of\n               the [collateral source] rule, explained above, to prevent a\n               tortfeasor from deriving any benefit from compensation or\n               indemnity that an injured party has received from a collateral\n               source. In other words, the focal point of the collateral source\n               rule is not whether an injured party has “incurred” certain\n               medical expenses. Rather, it is whether a tort victim has\n               received benefits from a collateral source that cannot be used to\n               reduce the amount of damages owed by a tortfeasor.\n\n\n\n        In addition, as noted in ¶ 15, supra, “a plaintiff could recover from a tortfeasor for\n          10\n\nthe reasonable value of medical services provided even if those services were provided\ngratuitously.” Mitchell v.

Safeway does not explain\nhow that type of “gift” scenario, in which a claimant can recover for charges never incurred\nor even billed, differs in any material way from the situation presented here.\n\n                                              19\n\f                    [Plaintiff] is entitled to seek full compensation from\n             [defendant]. Based on the cases cited above dealing with the\n             collateral source rule, we conclude that [defendant] cannot\n             deduct from that full compensation any part of the benefits\n             [plaintiff] received from his contractual arrangement with his\n             health insurance carrier, whether those benefits took the form\n             of medical expense payments or amounts written off because of\n             agreements between his health insurance carrier and his health\n             care providers. Those amounts written off are as much of a\n             benefit for which [plaintiff] paid consideration as are the actual\n             cash payments made by his health insurance carrier to the\n             health care providers. The portions of medical expenses that\n             health care providers write off constitute “compensation or\n             indemnity received by a tort victim from a source collateral to\n             the tortfeasor . . . .”\n\n                    This conclusion is consistent with the purpose of\n             compensatory damages, which is to make a tort victim whole.\n             However, the injured party should be made whole by the\n             tortfeasor, not by a combination of compensation from the\n             tortfeasor and collateral sources. The wrongdoer cannot reap\n             the benefit of a contract for which the wrongdoer paid no\n             compensation. The extent of [defendant’s] liability to [plaintiff]\n             cannot be “measured by deducting financial benefits received by\n             [plaintiff] from collateral sources.” In other words, “it is the\n             tortfeasor’s responsibility to compensate for all harm that he [or\n             she] causes, not confined to the net loss that the injured party\n             receives.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 920A cmt. b\n             (1977).\n\n                    To the extent that such a result provides a windfall to the\n             injured party, we have previously recognized that consequence\n             and concluded that the victim of the wrong rather than the\n             wrongdoer should receive the windfall.\n\n531 S.E.2d at 321-23 (citations omitted); see also Radvany v.

As this court has stated, the collateral source rule\n\n              is an attempt to resolve a basic conflict between two guiding\n              principles of tort law, namely, (1) the limitation of\n              compensation to the injured party to the amount necessary to\n              make him whole and (2) the avoidance of a windfall to the\n\n\n\n       11\n        Recognizing that majority view, Professor Dobbs states:\n\n                      Because the provider who writes off the balance usually\n              does so in compliance with terms of a contract with the insurer\n              or Medicare, it is possible to conceptualize the write-off as a\n              collateral source benefit paid for by way of the insurer’s\n              contractual agreement with the provider. Alternatively, some\n              courts have said that whether or not the write-off is a true\n              collateral source situation, the rationale and policy behind the\n              collateral source rules, statutory or common law, apply. . . . In\n              line with the basic measure of damages—the reasonable value\n              of the medical services rendered—most courts passing on the\n              issue in recent years have made rulings that permit the plaintiff\n              to prove all of the reasonable medical charges, even though\n              some of those charges were waived by the provider.\n\n2 Dan B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, § 380 (Supp. 2005), at 132-33.\n\n                                             21\n\f               tortfeasor if a choice must be made between him and the injured\n               party.\n\nHall, 119 Ariz. at 74, 579 P.2d at 578; see also Mitchell, 883 A.2d at 38. “‘Because the\n\nlaw must sanction one windfall and deny the other, it favors the victim of the wrong rather\n\nthan the wrongdoer.’” Acuar, 531 S.E.2d at 323, quoting Schickling v.

Dobbs,\n\nLaw of Remedies, § 8.6(3), at 496 (2d ed. 1993) (“[I]f the collateral source rule were\n\nabolished, the plaintiff will have paid for security and not for the opportunity of a double\n\nrecovery.
