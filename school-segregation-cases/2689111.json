Acts 1227 (Apr. 16,\n2013), codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1901 et seq. The 2013 Act contained a\n\"broad school choice transfer option.\" Teague v. Cooper, 720 F.3d 973, 975 (8th Cir.\n2013). But the 2013 Act also contained limitations. In relevant part, it provided that\n\"[a] school district annually may declare an exemption under this section if the school\ndistrict is subject to the desegregation order or mandate of a federal court or agency\nremedying the effects of past racial segregation.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1906(b)(1)\n(2013). The 2013 Act required a school district to \"notify the [Arkansas Department\nof Education] by April 1\" if the district intends to declare an exemption \"in the next\nschool year.\" Id. § 6–18–1906(b)(3). The \"exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited\nto individual school districts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates.\"\nTeague, 720 F.3d at 977 n.2.\n\n       Heath Adkisson, Lori Adkisson, Ryan Braswell, Melissa Braswell, Oliver\nCoppedge, Tracy Coppedge, George A. Hale III, Stephanie Hale, Jeff Langston, and\nMissy Langston (collectively, \"appellants\") have minor children who reside within\nthe Blytheville School District # 5 (\"District\"). The appellants applied to transfer their\nchildren from the District to neighboring school districts, but the District's Board of\nDirectors subsequently adopted a resolution to exempt the District from the 2013 Act\nunder § 6–18–1906(b) on the basis that the District \"is subject to a desegregation\norder or mandate of a federal court of [sic] agency remedying the effects of past racial\nsegregation.\" The appellants brought suit against the District, alleging that the District\nviolated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the 2013–2014 school year,\nto opt out under § 6–18–1906(b) of the 2013 Act. They sued for violations of their\ndue process and equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for violations of\n\n\n      1\n       Portions of this introductory section are taken directly from this panel's earlier\ndecision, Stevenson v. Blytheville Sch. Dist. No. 5, 762 F.3d 765 (8th Cir. 2014),\nwithout specific attribution.\n\n                                           -2-\n\fthe Arkansas Civil Rights Act (ACRA). As relief, the appellants requested a\ndeclaration and permanent injunction against the District, as well as damages\nallegedly stemming from their due process claims. The appellants also sought\npunitive damages for the District's allegedly race-based conduct. The appellants\nmoved for partial summary judgment, and the District filed a counter-motion for\nsummary judgment. The district court2 denied the appellants' motion for partial\nsummary judgment but granted the District's counter-motion for summary judgment.\nThe court denied the appellants' request for a declaration, permanent injunction, and\ndamages. On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment to the District because the undisputed facts show that the District\n(1) violated due process by abusing its power under state law and failing to provide\npre-deprivation process, and (2) violated equal protection by using race as the reason\nfor its exemption and nullifying the 2013 Act within its borders on the pretense that\nit was subject to a desegregation order. We affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n                               A. Statutory Background\n       Despite containing a \"broad school choice transfer option,\" Teague, 720 F.3d\nat 976, the 2013 Act also enabled certain resident school districts to restrict or defeat\na student's ability to transfer to a nonresident district. See Ark. Code Ann.\n§ 6–18–1906(a)–(b) (2013). One of those limitations set forth an exemption for a\nqualifying school district, providing:\n\n      (b) (1) A school district annually may declare an exemption under this\n      section if the school district is subject to the desegregation order or\n      mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past racial\n      segregation.\n\n\n\n      2\n       The Honorable Kristine G. Baker, United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f             (2)(A) An exemption declared by a board of directors under this\n             subsection is irrevocable for one (1) year from the date the school\n             district notifies the Department of Education of the declaration of\n             exemption.\n\n                    (B) After each year of exemption, the board of directors\n                    may elect to participate in public school choice under this\n                    section if the school district's participation does not\n                    conflict with the school district's federal court-ordered\n                    desegregation program.\n\n             (3) A school district shall notify the department by April 1 if in\n             the next school year the school district intends to:\n\n                    (A) Declare an exemption under this section; or\n\n                    (B) Resume participation after a period of exemption.\n\nId. § 6–18–1906(b).\n\n       The General Assembly's intent was \"that the 2013 Act would be effective on\nthe date of its approval by the Governor.\" Teague, 720 F.3d at 975–76. It specifically\nstated its intent to dispel any \"'uncertainty about the viability of [existing] transfers\nand future transfers'\" and that the 2013 Act was \"'immediately necessary to resolve\nthe uncertainty in the law before the 2013-2014 school year and preserve existing\nstudent transfers.'\" Id. at 976 (emphasis added) (quoting Act 1227, 2013 Ark. Acts\n1227, § 7 (Apr. 16, 2013)). But the General Assembly enacted the 2013 Act on April\n16, 2013—15 days past the April 1 deadline to declare an exemption as provided in\n§ 6–181–906(b)(3). As a result, on May 1, 2013, the Arkansas Department of\nEducation (ADE)3 released a memo that stated:\n\n\n      3\n        The 2013 Act provides that the \"State Board of Education may promulgate\nrules to implement\" the 2013 Act. Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1907 (2013).\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      As noted above, Act 1227 did not become effective until April 16, 2013.\n      However, the [2013] Act sets April 1 as the date by which a school\n      district must notify the ADE of its intention to declare an exemption for\n      participation in public school choice under the [2013] Act. The ADE\n      will not attempt to reestablish a deadline that is set in law. However, so\n      school districts and the ADE can properly administer all aspects of Act\n      1227 in an orderly fashion and so that parents, students, patrons and\n      school district leaders may be aware of those school districts which are\n      subject to desegregation orders or federal agency mandates remedying\n      the effects of past racial segregation, the ADE requests that school\n      districts notify the ADE of any exemption by Friday, May 17, 2013. . . .\n\n      Contemporaneous with notice to the ADE, the ADE also requests that\n      school districts notify the superintendents of each of their\n      geographically contiguous school districts of the exemption. Please note\n      that Act 1227 does not provide the ADE the authority to rule a particular\n      exemption valid or invalid. However, the Act does allow for such\n      exemptions if \"the school district is subject to the desegregation order\n      or mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past\n      racial segregation.\" The ADE will post a list of school districts that\n      declare an exemption on its website.\n\n      The 2013 Act also provided that the parents of students seeking to transfer to\nattend a school in a nonresident district had to submit an application to the\nnonresident district with a copy to the resident district on a form approved by the\nADE and postmarked no later than June 1 of the year in which the student sought to\nbegin the fall semester at the nonresident district. Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1905(a)\n(2013). By August 1 of the school year in which the student sought enrollment in a\nnonresident district, the superintendent of the nonresident district had to notify the\nparent and the resident district in writing as to whether the student's application had\nbeen accepted or rejected. Id. § 6–18–1905(b)(1). If the nonresident district accepted\nthe application, then the notification letter had to include the deadline by which the\nstudent had to enroll in the nonresident district, after which the acceptance was null,\nand instructions for the renewal procedure that the nonresident district established.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fId. § 6–18–1905(b)(3). If the nonresident district rejected the application, then the\nnotification letter had to state the reason for the rejection. Id. § 6–18–1905(b)(2).\n\n       Students whose applications for transfer were rejected by the nonresident\ndistrict could request a hearing before the Arkansas State Board of Education (\"Board\nof Education\") to reconsider the transfer. Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(1). The 2013 Act\nrequired that a student request in writing an appeal hearing within ten days after the\nstudent or student's parent received the notification letter. Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(2)(A).\n\"As part of the review process, the parent may submit supporting documentation that\nthe transfer would be in the best educational, social, or psychological interest of the\nstudent.\" Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(2)(B). The Board of Education could overturn the\nnonresident district's decision on appeal; if it did so, then it had to notify \"the parent,\nthe nonresident district, and the resident district of the basis for the state board's\ndecision.\" Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(3).\n\n                      B. Factual and Procedural Background\n       As of April 29, 2013, appellants Heath and Lori Adkisson, Ryan and Melissa\nBraswell, Oliver and Tracy Coppedge, George and Stephanie Hale, and Jeff and\nMissy Langston were residents of and had children who resided in the District.\nBetween April 19, 2013, and April 26, 2013, each appellant submitted an application\non behalf of one of their children for transfer from the District to a nonresident\ndistrict under the 2013 Act for the school year beginning in fall of 2013. Each child\nfor whom a transfer was sought is Caucasian. The District received the appellants'\napplications between April 22, 2013, and April 26, 2013.\n\n      On April 29, 2013, the District met in a special session after notifying the press\nunder the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act open-meetings law. According to the\nappellants, the District did not notify them of the special session. At that special\nmeeting, the District's Board of Education adopted a resolution by a vote of six to\nzero to declare the District exempt under the 2013 Act. Richard Atwill,\n\n                                           -6-\n\fsuperintendent of the District, informed the ADE of the resolution and exemption by\nletter dated May 9, 2013, received by the ADE on May 14, 2013.4\n\n       The District declared the exemption in April 2013 based in part on Franklin v.\nBoard of Education of Blytheville School District No. 5, U.S.D.C. No. J–71–C–35\n(E.D. Ark.). The history of the Franklin litigation begins on July 19, 1968, when the\nRegional Director of the Office of Civil Rights at the United States Department of\nHealth, Education, and Welfare (HEW) sent a letter to the District approving the\ndistrict's \"plan for the complete elimination of the dual school system in the\nBlytheville Public Schools.\"\n\n       According to the District's plan, the \"District was to be completely\ndesegregated by the beginning of the 1970–71 school year.\" But the HEW's onsite\naudit of the District\n\n      on October 6, 1970, revealed that [the District's] commitment to a\n      desegregated system had not been implemented in that the Robinson and\n      Franklin Elementary Schools remain[ed] identifiably Negro schools.\n      Under the freedom of choice plan which [was] still in [the District's]\n      elementary schools, there [were] no white students in either of these\n      schools.\n\nBased on the audit, the Director of the Office for Civil Rights of the HEW sent a\nletter to the District on February 11, 1971, confirming that \"because of the failure of\nthe [District] to convert to a unitary school system the matter was being referred to\n[the Department of Justice (DOJ)] with a recommendation that appropriate\nenforcement action be initiated.\" On May 12, 1971, the District requested \"a one-year\n\n\n\n      4\n      On March 31, 2014, the District renewed its claim of exemption under the\n2013 Act.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcontinuance of the present freedom of choice plan of school desegregation for the\nelementary schools in the [District].\"\n\n       On June 18, 1971, the DOJ denied the District's request, stating that the DOJ\nwas \"unable to approve the [D]istrict's continued operation under a freedom of choice\nplan of school desegregation.\" According to the DOJ, six elementary schools within\nthe District contained five racially identifiable white or black schools. It explained\nthat school desegregation could not be delayed because of \"possible community\nopposition to a change in the elementary school structure.\" The DOJ gave the District\nten days within which to advise the DOJ of \"what plans the Blytheville School Board\nhas taken and what procedures have been adopted to [e]nsure that such plans will be\nimplemented at the beginning of the 1971–72 school year, for full conversion of the\n[District] to a unitary non-racial system.\" The DOJ expressed its \"hope that the\nBlytheville School Board w[ould] not delay in [its] obligation to convert to a unitary\nsystem and that compliance c[ould] be brought about by voluntary means rather than\nby resort to the coercion of the courts.\"\n\n      Nonetheless, litigation ensued, as African-American parents filed suit on July\n7, 1971, against the District seeking to enjoin the District from continuing to operate\na dual school system and to require it to implement a unitary school system. See\nFranklin, U.S.D.C. No. J–71–C–35. On August 19, 1971, the district court in\nFranklin entered an order approving the District's desegregation plan, with the\nexception of certain identified issues, ending its \"freedom of choice\" plan that was\npreviously rejected by the HEW and the DOJ.\n\n      On May 31, 1973, the HEW sent a letter to the ADE advising that the HEW\nhad reviewed the district court's desegregation order, as well as the District's\nassurance of compliance with that order, and determined that \"[t]he documents [were]\nadequate\" to satisfy Title VI requirements \"for the purpose of approving applications\nand plans for continued participation in Federal programs.\" But the HEW made clear\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthat it had not considered the merits of the District's desegregation plan and advised\nthat,\n\n      [i]n an appropriate proceeding, either the Government or a private party\n      may seek modifications of the desegregation plan or take other action as\n      it may deem necessary. The school district must modify its plan as\n      ordered by the court to remain in compliance. Your office and the school\n      board are requested to keep the Office for Civil Rights informed of any\n      appeals from or modification of the court order.\n\n       On June 21, 1973, the district court entered an order closing the case but\nretaining jurisdiction. The district court stated in this order that,\n\n      [o]n the basis of correspondence with counsel for the parties, the Court\n      concludes that issues reserved in the Court's order [approving the\n      District's desegregation plan] are no longer a subject of controversy.\n      There being no pending issues in this preceding, it is ordered that this\n      case be, and it is hereby, closed but that the Court retain jurisdiction of\n      this cause and of the parties hereto for necessary and appropriate\n      purposes.\n\n       On December 6, 1978, the district court entered an order dismissing the case\nbecause, since closing it, \"the Court ha[d] received no further communication\nconcerning this case.\" Three days later, on December 9, 1978, plaintiffs' counsel sent\nthe district court a letter that stated:\n\n      The Court sua[]sponte closed this case. I am writing to remind the Court\n      that there is no finding by the Court that a unitary school system has\n      been achieved, and there is no order requiring the school district to\n      hereafter maintain an integrated system in all respects. Finally, the Court\n      did not award the prevailing parties appropriate costs and counsel fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      With respect to the establishment of a unitary school system, I think the\n      obligation of the Court is to make some further inquiry and to also\n      [e]nsure that faculty and staff desegregation principles are clearly\n      expressed.\n\n      I am bringing these matters to the Court's attention in the hope that the\n      Court will rescind its order and judgment filed December 7 and\n      substitute an order requiring the defendants to provide the Court\n      something in the nature of a comprehensive final report which relates to\n      students, staff, programs and facilities.\n\nThe district court in Franklin took no further action.\n\n       The appellants filed this action on May 20, 2013, alleging that the District\nviolated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the 2013–2014 school year,\nto opt out under § 6–18–1906(b) of the 2013 Act. They sued for violations of their\ndue process and equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for violations of\nthe ACRA. As relief, the appellants requested a declaration and permanent injunction\nagainst the District, as well as damages allegedly stemming from their due process\nclaims and punitive damages for the District's allegedly race-based conduct.\n\n      The appellants also sought a preliminary injunction requiring the District to\nrescind its resolution declaring the exemption for the 2013–2014 school year under\nthe 2013 Act. The district court denied the preliminary injunction, and the appellants\nappealed. We dismissed the appeal as moot given the \"clear terms of the motion,\"\nwhich provided that the motion pertained to the 2013–2014 school year. Stevenson,\n762 F.3d at 770.\n\n      Thereafter, the appellants moved for partial summary judgment on their claims,\nand the District moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court denied\nthe appellants' motion for partial summary judgment but granted the District's\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcounter-motion for summary judgment. The court denied the appellants' request for\na declaration, permanent injunction, and damages.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n       On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment to the District because the undisputed facts show that the District\n(1) violated their due process rights by abusing its power under state law and failing\nto provide pre-deprivation process, and (2) violated their equal protection rights by\nusing race as the reason for its exemption and nullifying the 2013 Act within its\nborders on the pretense that it was subject to a desegregation order.5\n\n                                    A. Mootness\n       As a preliminary matter, we must address whether the current appeal is moot\nin light of recent events. Prior to oral argument, the Arkansas General Assembly\npassed Act 560, which became law on March 20, 2015. The statute amends the 2013\nAct, striking former § 6-18-1906(b), the section at issue in this appeal, and adding\n§ 6-13-113, which provides:\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        The Arkansas Constitution secures the right to not be deprived of any right,\nprivilege or immunity on account of race. Ark. Const. Art. 2, § 3. The ACRA also\nenables a cause of action for legal and equitable relief for state constitutional\nviolations. Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-101, et seq. \"When construing [the ACRA], a\ncourt may look for guidance to state and federal decisions interpreting the federal\nCivil Rights Act of 1871, as amended and codified in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as in effect\non January 1, 1993, which decisions and act shall have persuasive authority only.\"\nArk. Code Ann. § 16-123-105(c). Based on § 16-123-105(c), the appellants advise\nthat \"they have analyzed their § 1983 and ACRA claims together for purposes of this\nappeal.\" We, too, will analyze the appellants' § 1983 and ACRA equal protection and\ndue process claims together.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f      (a) By January 1, 2016, a school district that is subject to a\n      desegregation order or desegregation-related order shall notify the\n      Department of Education in writing.\n\n      (b) A school district that is subject to a desegregation order or a\n      desegregation-related order shall include in the written notice to the\n      department:\n\n            (1) A copy of the desegregation order or desegregation-related\n            order;\n\n            (2) The case heading and case number of each court case in which\n            the order was entered;\n\n            (3) The name and location of each court that maintains\n            jurisdiction over the order; and\n\n            (4) A description of the school choice student transfer\n            desegregation obligations, if any, that the school district is subject\n            to, related to the order.\n\n      (c) A school district that is released from court supervision related to a\n      desegregation order or desegregation-related order shall promptly notify\n      the department.\n\n      (d) A school district that fails to meet the requirements of this section is\n      in violation of the Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public\n      Schools and School Districts.\n\n      (e) The department shall post on the department's website all written\n      notifications received as required by this section.\n\nArk. Code Ann. § 6-13-113 (2015).\n\n     Following oral argument, on April 22, 2015, the District sent a letter to the\nADE claiming the exemption under § 6-13-113, explaining that it\n\n                                         -12-\n\f      is a party to the following desegregation lawsuits that are still active:\n      mandates issued in 1971 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S.\n      Department of Health, Education and Welfare; Franklin, et al. v.\n      Blytheville School District No. 5, U.S.D.C. No. J-71-C-35; and Harvell,\n      et al. v. Blytheville School District et al., U.S.D.C. No. J-C-89-225, 126\n      F.3d 1038 (8th Cir. 1997). The desegregation obligations of these cases\n      prohibit the District from taking any action, or refraining from taking\n      any action, the natural and probable consequence of which would be a\n      segregative impact within the District (i.e., the creation, maintaining, or\n      increasing of racially identifiable schools). Permitting school choice\n      under the Acts would have such an impact. Allowing school choice\n      would, therefore, be in conflict with the District's desegregation\n      obligation still outstanding. The District further relies upon Ark. Code\n      Ann. § 6-18-317(a), which prohibits transfers if either the resident or\n      residing district has ever been under a desegregation-related court order.\n      See Edgerson on behalf of Edgerson v. Clinton, 86 F.3d 833 (8th Cir.\n      1996).\n\n       \"[C]ourts distinguish between claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,\nwhich may be mooted by the repeal of a statute, and claims seeking monetary relief,\nwhich generally are not mooted.\" Tini Bikinis-Saginaw, LLC v. Saginaw Charter Tp.,\n836 F. Supp. 2d 504, 520 (E.D. Mich. 2011). \"'We can neither declare\nunconstitutional nor enjoin the enforcement of a provision that is no longer in effect.'\"\nId. (quoting Brandywine, Inc. v. City of Richmond, 359 F.3d 830, 836 (6th Cir.\n2004)). But \"plaintiffs' claim for money damages [is] not moot\" where \"the plaintiffs\ncould seek damages\" caused by a statutory violation. Id. (citing Brandwyine, 359 F.3d\nat 836 (\"Plaintiffs' claim for monetary damages, however, was not properly dismissed\nas moot, because an award of monetary damages would compensate plaintiffs for the\nloss of the opportunity to engage in protected expression caused by the enforcement\nof the zoning scheme.\")).\n\n      Given that the Arkansas General Assembly has amended the 2013 Act, striking\n§ 6-18-1906(b), and that the District has claimed an exemption under the newly added\n\n                                          -13-\n\f§ 6-13-113, the appellants' request for declaratory and injunctive relief as it pertains\nto the 2013 Act is moot. But the appellants could potentially recover money damages\nfor any constitutional violation arising from the District's alleged violation of the\n2013 Act; therefore, the money-damages claims are not moot; accordingly, we\naddress the appellants' underlying due process and equal protection claims.\n\n                               B. Constitutional Claims\n       \"We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing\nthe record in the light most favorable to [the appellants] and drawing all reasonable\ninferences in [their] favor.\" Montgomery v. City of Ames, 749 F.3d 689, 694 (8th Cir.\n2014) (citation omitted).\n\n       The appellants' due process and equal protection claims are premised on the\nDistrict's purported taking of the exemption in violation of the 2013 Act. But\n\"violations of state laws . . . do not by themselves state a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. Section 1983 guards and vindicates federal rights alone.\" Ebmeier v. Stump,\n70 F.3d 1012, 1013 (8th Cir. 1995); see also Williams v. Hopkins, 130 F.3d 333, 337\n(8th Cir. 1997) (\"Ordinarily, an alleged violation of state law does not by itself state\na claim redressable by a § 1983 action.\").\n\n      It is established beyond peradventure that a state actor's failure to\n      observe a duty imposed by state law, standing alone, is not a sufficient\n      foundation on which to erect a section 1983 claim. Although it is true\n      that constitutional significance may attach to certain interests created by\n      state law, not every transgression of state law does double duty as a\n      constitutional violation.\n\nEbmeier, 70 F.3d at 1013 (quotation, citation, and footnote omitted).\n\n       \"We must be extremely careful in examining claimed violations of state\nlaws . . . .

Rinehart, 119\nF.3d 1303, 1312 (8th Cir. 1997). Therefore, we now examine whether the District's\npurported violation of the 2013 Act violates the appellants' due process or equal\nprotection rights.\n\n                                    1. Due Process\n       The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides, in relevant\npart, that no state shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. \"This clause has two components: the\nprocedural due process and the substantive due process components.\" Singleton v.\nCecil, 176 F.3d 419, 424 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (citing Cnty. of Sacramento v.\nLewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998)). Here, the appellants proceed only on their procedural\ndue process claim.\n\n             To make out a claim for a violation of procedural due process, the\n      plaintiff has the burden of showing that \"(1) he had a life, liberty, or\n      property interest protected by the Due Process Clause; (2) he was\n      deprived of this protected interest; and (3) the state did not afford him\n      adequate procedural rights prior to depriving him of the property\n      interest.\"\n\nEJS Props., LLC v.

Liberty Interest\n       The appellants first argue that they have a protected liberty interest in directing\nthe education of their children and that they were deprived of this interest by the\nDistrict's adoption of the resolution. The district court rejected the appellants'\nargument, concluding that \"[t]he fundamental rights and liberties plaintiffs claim here\nexceed that which the Supreme Court has recognized.\" The district court found no\n\n                                          -15-\n\fcases \"holding a parent's ability to choose where his or her child is educated within\nthe public school system is a fundamental right or liberty.\"\n\n       \"In [Washington v.] Glucksberg, the Supreme Court articulated the fundamental\nrights protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Combs v. Home-Ctr. Sch. Dist., 540 F.3d\n231, 247 (3d Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (citing Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\n719–20 (1997)). The Supreme Court \"[i]ncluded in the list . . . the right 'to direct the\neducation and upbringing of one's children.'\" Id. (quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at\n720 (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923) (holding state law\nprohibiting foreign language instruction violated the \"power of parents to control the\neducation of their own\"); Pierce v. Soc'y of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus &\nMary, 268 U.S. 510, 534–35 (1925) (holding state compulsory education law\nrequiring students to attend solely public schools \"unreasonably interferes with the\nliberty of parents . . . to direct the upbringing and education of children under their\ncontrol\"))).\n\n         \"Although [the appellants] assert the fundamental nature of their general right,\nit is a limited one.\" Id. As the Third Circuit has recognized,\n\n      \"[t]he Supreme Court has never been called upon to define the precise\n      boundaries of a parent's right to control a child's upbringing and\n      education. It is clear, however, that the right is neither absolute nor\n      unqualified.\" C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 F.3d 159, 182 (3d\n      Cir. 2005). \"The case law in this area establishes that parents simply do\n      not have a constitutional right to control each and every aspect of their\n      children's education and oust the state's authority over that subject.\"\n      Swanson [v. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-L,] 135 F.3d [694,] 699\n      [(10th Cir. 1998)].\n\nId. at 247–48 (first alteration in original) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f     Here, as happened in Combs, the appellants rely \"on Meyer and Pierce for\nfoundational support.\" Id. at 248.\n\n             In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S. Ct. 625, 67 L. Ed.\n      1042, the Court held that the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause\n      of the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right \"to acquire useful\n      knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children,\" Id., at\n      399, 43 S. Ct., at 626, and, concomitantly, the right to send one's\n      children to a private school that offers specialized training in that case,\n      instruction in the German language. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268\n      U.S. 510, 45 S. Ct. 571, 69 L. Ed. 1070, the Court applied \"the doctrine\n      of Meyer v. Nebraska,\" Id., at 534, 45 S. Ct., at 573, to hold\n      unconstitutional an Oregon law requiring the parent, guardian, or other\n      person having custody of a child between 8 and 16 years of age to send\n      that child to public school on pain of criminal liability. The Court\n      thought it \"entirely plain that the (statute) unreasonably interferes with\n      the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and\n      education of children under their control.\" Id., at 534–535, 45 S. Ct., at\n      573. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed. 2d\n      15, the Court stressed the limited scope of Pierce, pointing out that it\n      lent \"no support to the contention that parents may replace state\n      educational requirements with their own idiosyncratic views of what\n      knowledge a child needs to be a productive and happy member of\n      society\" but rather \"held simply that while a State may posit\n      (educational) standards, it may not pre-empt the educational process by\n      requiring children to attend public schools.\" Id., at 239, 92 S. Ct., at\n      1545 (White, J., concurring). And in Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S.\n      455, 93 S. Ct. 2804, 37 L. Ed. 2d 723, the Court once again stressed the\n      \"limited scope of Pierce,\" Id., at 461, 93 S. Ct., at 2809, which simply\n      \"affirmed the right of private schools to exist and to operate . . . .\" Id.,\n      at 462, 93 S. Ct., at 2809.\n\nRunyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176–77 (1976) (alteration in original) (emphases\nadded).\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f       In summary, Meyer and Pierce stand for the proposition that \"[t]he Fourteenth\nAmendment prevents a state from denying parents the right to choose private schools\nfor their children's education.\" Pelletier v. Me. Principals' Ass'n, 261 F. Supp. 2d 10,\n13 (D. Me. 2003) (emphasis added) (citing Pierce, 268 U.S. at 534–35; Meyer, 262\nU.S. at 399–400). Here, the District \"has not restricted the [appellants'] constitutional\nright to educational choice. The [appellants] are free to send [their children] to public\nschool, or to send them to . . . private school, or to educate them at home. They have\nfreely chosen [to send their children to public school].\" Id. We agree with the district\ncourt that neither Meyer, Pierce, nor any other relevant precedent support the\nproposition that \"a parent's ability to choose where his or her child is educated within\nthe public school system is a fundamental right or liberty.\" Adkisson v. Blytheville\nSch. Dist. No. 5, No. 3:13–cv–00127–KGB, 2014 WL 6819729, at *15 (E.D. Ark.\nDec. 2, 2014) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the appellants have failed to prove that\nthey have a protected liberty interest.\n\n                                     b. Property Interest\n       The appellants next argue that the 2013 Act creates a protected property\ninterest in public school choice. According to the appellants, § 6-18-1906(b) set forth\nlimits on the District's ability to claim an exemption and those limits were part of their\nproperty interest. They contend that the District denied them this \"state-defined\nproperty interest by defying the April 1 deadline and claiming the exemption based\non a case to which [the District] has not been subject for more than 35 years.\"\n\n             To have a constitutionally cognizable property interest in a right\n      or a benefit, a person must have \"a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.\"\n      See Bd. of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92\n      S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972). The Due Process Clause does not\n      create any property interest; it merely protects property rights arising\n      \"from an independent source such as state law.\" Id. A property interest\n      arises when state law creates \"expectations that are 'justifiable.'\"\n      O'Bannon v. Town Ct. Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 796, 100 S. Ct. 2467,\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f      65 L. Ed. 2d 506 (1980) (quoting Vitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 489, 100\n      S. Ct. 1254, 63 L. Ed. 2d 552 (1980)). No property interest arises where\n      the statutory claim to a benefit is \"too ephemeral and insubstantial.\" Id.\n      (quoting Meachum v. Fano, 427 U.S. 215, 228, 96 S. Ct. 2532, 49 L. Ed.\n      2d 451 (1976)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAustell v. Sprenger, 690 F.3d 929, 935 (8th Cir. 2012); see also Batra v. Bd. of\nRegents of Univ. of Neb., 79 F.3d 717, 720 (8th Cir. 1996) (\"For a property interest\nto arise, a government employee must have a 'legitimate claim of entitlement' to\ncontinued employment, as opposed to a mere subjective expectancy.\" (quoting Roth,\n408 U.S. at 577)).\n\n       Although a state \"may not be constitutionally obligated to establish and\nmaintain a public school system,\" once it has done so, \"the State is constrained to\nrecognize a student's legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property\ninterest which is protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565,\n574 (1975). Goss involved the interference with students' legitimate entitlement to a\npublic education resulting from the students' suspension. Id. at 579 (\"At the very\nminimum, . . . students facing suspension and the consequent interference with a\nprotected property interest must be given some kind of notice and afforded some kind\nof hearing\"). The Court characterized the students' interest as \"avoid[ing] unfair or\nmistaken exclusion from the educational process.\" Id.; see also id. at 581 (\"The\nClause requires at least these rudimentary precautions against unfair or mistaken\nfindings of misconduct and arbitrary exclusion from school.\" (footnote omitted)).\n\"Therefore, under Goss, the property interest which is protected by the Due Process\nClause is the right to participate in the entire educational process and not the right to\nparticipate in each individual component of that process.\" Mazevski v. Horseheads\nCent. Sch. Dist., 950 F. Supp. 69, 72 (W.D.N.Y. 1997). Here, as the district court\nfound, the appellants \"have not been excluded from the educational process,\" as the\nDistrict has not prevented them from attending public school. Adkisson, 2014 WL\n6819729, at *16.\n\n                                          -19-\n\f       Furthermore, we agree with the district court that \"the 2013 Act does not create\na property interest in exercising public school choice because plaintiffs do not have\nmore than a mere subjective expectancy of school choice under the 2013 Act.\" Id.\n(citation omitted). \"A protected property interest is a matter of state law involving 'a\nlegitimate claim to entitlement as opposed to a mere subjective expectancy.'\" Snaza\nv. City of Saint Paul, Minn., 548 F.3d 1178, 1182–83 (8th Cir. 2008) (quoting\nBituminous Materials, Inc. v. Rice Cnty., 126 F.3d 1068, 1070 (8th Cir. 1997)).\n\"Property interests are not created by the Constitution, 'they are created and their\ndimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an\nindependent source such as state law . . . .\" Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470\nU.S. 532, 538 (1985) (alteration in original) (quoting Roth, 408 U.S. at 577). But\n\"federal constitutional law determines whether that interest rises to the level of a\nlegitimate claim of entitlement protected by the Due Process Clause.\" Town of Castle\nRock, Colo. v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 757 (2005) (quotations and citations omitted).\nAn \"entitlement\" is defined as \"[a]n absolute right to a . . . benefit . . . granted\nimmediately upon meeting a legal requirement.\" Black's Law Dictionary 612 (9th ed.\n2009) (emphasis added).\n\n       Here, the 2013 Act \"enable[d] a student to attend a school in a nonresident\ndistrict, subject to the limitations under § 6-18-1906.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(a)\n(2013). It required each school district to \"adopt by resolution specific standards for\nacceptance and rejection of applications.\" Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(1). In setting forth its\nstandards, the Act permitted school districts to \"include without limitation the\ncapacity of a program, class, grade level, or school building.\" Id. § 6-18-\n1903(d)(2)(A). The 2013 Act required school districts to give priority to applicants\nwith siblings or stepsiblings residing in the same household who were \"already\nenrolled in the nonresident district by choice.\" Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(2)(B)(i)–(ii). In\nsetting forth standards, the 2013 Act prohibited school districts from considering an\napplicant's academic achievement, athletic ability, extracurricular ability, English\nproficiency level, and prior disciplinary record. Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(2)(C)(i)–(iv). Nor\n\n                                         -20-\n\fdid the 2013 Act permit school districts to discriminate \"on the basis of gender,\nnational origin, race, ethnicity, religion, or disability\" in evaluating a transfer\napplication. Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(3). The 2013 Act directed nonresident districts to\nnotify an applicant and the resident district in writing as to whether the nonresident\ndistrict had accepted or rejected the application by August 1 of the school year in\nwhich the applicant sought to enroll. Id. § 6-18-1905(b)(1). If the nonresident district\nrejected the application, it had to \"state in the notification letter the reason for\nrejection.\" Id. § 6-18-1905(b)(2).\n\n       In summary, although the 2013 Act prohibited nonresident school districts\nfrom considering certain characteristics of an applicant, it still invested the\nnonresident school district with the discretion to decide whether to accept a student\nseeking transfer. Cf. Horton v. City of Smithville, 117 F. App'x 345, 347–48 (5th Cir.\n2004) (\"[D]iscretionary statutes do not give rise to constitutionally-protected property\ninterests.\" (footnote omitted)). Thus, as the district court recognized, even if the\nDistrict had not taken the exemption, \"nonresident districts retained discretion on\nwhether to accept students seeking to transfer.\" Adkisson, 2014 WL 6819729, at *16.\n\n       In fact, the appellants concede that \"[t]he 2013 Act does not guarantee that an\napplication for transfer will be accepted.\" Nevertheless, they argue that their\n\"property interest does not hinge on the prospect of acceptance by the nonresident\ndistrict\" but instead \"stems from their right of access to the educational process,\nincluding their right to seek other educational opportunities for them, whether within\n[the District] or elsewhere.\" According to the appellants, the District eliminated their\nability to exercise their right by illegally claiming an exemption under the 2013 Act.\nBut the appellants' argument misses the mark. In reviewing whether the appellants\nhave a protected property interest, we must examine what the 2013 Act provides to\nthe appellants. And, by its plain language, what it provides to them is the possibility\nof transfer to another district, not a guarantee or absolute right to transfer.\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f      Accordingly, the appellants have failed to prove that they have a protected\nproperty interest, and their procedural due process claim necessarily fails.6\n\n                                 2. Equal Protection\n       The appellants argue that the District \"violated equal protection by using race\nas the reason for its exemption and nullifying the 2013 Act within its borders on the\npretense that it is subject to Franklin, which is irrational and capricious.\" The\nappellants argue that strict scrutiny applies because race clearly played a part in the\nDistrict's exemption decision. Alternatively, the appellants argue that even if race\nplayed no part in the District's exemption decision, the District's decision has no\nrational basis.\n\n        \"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment commands that\nno state shall 'deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws,' which is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be\ntreated alike.\" City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985) (citation omitted). Strict scrutiny applies to state action where \"a State treats\npersons differently based on a suspect classification, such as race.\" Exec. Air Taxi\nCorp. v. City of Bismark, N.D., 518 F.3d 562, 566 (8th Cir. 2008).

Proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.\" Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro.\nHousing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264–65 (1977) (citing Washington v. Davis, 426\nU.S. 229 (1976)). But \"an allegation of disproportionate impact 'is only relevant to\nthe extent that it 'reflects a discriminatory purpose.''\" Friends of Lake View, 578 F.3d\nat 761 (quoting Ricketts v. City of Columbia, 36 F.3d 775, 781 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting Davis, 426 U.S. at 239)). \"When there is a proof that a discriminatory\npurpose has been a motivating factor in the decision, this judicial deference is no\nlonger justified.\" Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265–66 (footnote omitted).\nOnly in \"exceeding rare cases\" will \"'a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other\nthan race, emerge[] from the effect of the state action even [though] the governing\n[action] appears neutral on its face.'\" Friends of Lake View, 578 F.3d at 762 n.12\n(second alteration in original) (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266).\n\n       The appellants first argue that they have provided direct evidence of racial\ndiscrimination to justify use of strict scrutiny and a consequent finding of an equal-\nprotection violation. In support of their argument, the appellants cite the testimony\nof the District's superintendent at the hearing on the appellants' motion for\npreliminary injunction. At that hearing, the superintendent explained that he\nrecommended that the District opt out of the 2013 Act based on his \"opinion that the\ndistrict was still part of a desegregation order.\" When asked how he formed that\nopinion, the superintendent responded, \"By looking back over some archival data that\nwe have in the district from past cases and from some law history,\" which included\nthe Franklin case. The superintendent testified that he reviewed this \"archival\ninformation\" in 2013 and 2012. When asked why he reviewed the information \"in\n2012,\" the superintendent replied:\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f      In the past, the State of Arkansas had school choice, but due to the\n      desegregation order, white students—we couldn't upset the racial\n      balance. As the old law was, we couldn't upset the racial balance of the\n      school district, therefore, white students were not allowed to transfer out\n      and black students were not allowed to transfer in. Black students could\n      transfer out, white students could transfer in, but—so I tried to keep up\n      on the information from the past to watch the trends.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n     We conclude that the superintendent's testimony is not direct evidence of racial\nanimus. We agree with the district court that \"the superintendent was speaking to the\nmanner in which the previous school choice statute was worded and how it was\nimplemented, not the requirements of Franklin or the 2013 Act.\" Adkisson, 2014 WL\n6819729, at *8 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n      The appellants next argue that they presented evidence of disparate impact and\npurpose based on race. This evidence relates to the Board of Education's approval in\n2009 of an open-enrollment charter school—KIPP Delta Academy (KIPP). KIPP\neducates about 250 students, most of whom come from the District and the majority\nof whom are African American or other minorities. KIPP must admit all applicants\nwho apply, unless there are more applicants than spaces, in which case KIPP must fill\nspaces according to a random, anonymous lottery.\n\n      Arkansas Code Annotated § 6-23-106 provides:\n\n      (a) The applicants for a public charter school, the local school district\n      board of directors for the district in which a proposed public charter\n      school would be located, and the [Board of Education] shall carefully\n      review the potential impact of an application for a public charter school\n      on the efforts of a public school district or public school districts to\n\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\f      comply with court orders and statutory obligations to create and\n      maintain a unitary system of desegregated public schools.\n\n      (b) The [Board of Education] shall attempt to measure the likely impact\n      of a proposed public charter school on the efforts of public school\n      districts to achieve and maintain a unitary system.\n\n      (c) The [Board of Education] shall not approve any public charter school\n      under this chapter or any other act or any combination of acts that\n      hampers, delays, or in any manner negatively affects the desegregation\n      efforts of a public school district or public school districts in this state.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n       The appellants argue that despite § 6-23-106(a) and the District's admitted\nreview of \"the KIPP Delta applications to operate and expand in Blytheville,\" the\nDistrict \"did not claim interference with desegregation efforts when black students\ntransferred out to KIPP Delta's campus in Blytheville.\" According to the appellants,\n\"most of the 250 students who transferred into KIPP Delta in Blytheville came from\n[the District],\" and \"[t]he overwhelming majority of children at KIPP Delta in\nBlytheville are black.\"\n\n       We first note that the approval of KIPP occurred \"under laws different than\nthose being discussed here.\" Stevenson v. Blytheville Sch. Dist. No. 5, 955 F. Supp.\n2d 955, 968 (E.D. Ark. 2013). Although the District was one of the parties with the\nresponsibility of \"review[ing] the potential impact of an application for a public\ncharter school on the efforts of a public school district or public school districts to\ncomply with court orders,\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-23-106(a), it was the Board of\nEducation that ultimately approved KIPP, id. § 6-23-106(c). At the preliminary-\ninjunction stage, the District's superintendent \"testified that the Blytheville District's\ninvolvement in the charter school review process is different than the Blytheville\nDistrict's involvement in implementing the 2013 Act.\" Stevenson, 955 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n                                          -25-\n\f968–69. Neither at the preliminary-injunction stage or now have the appellants\npresented any evidence to contradict the superintendent's statement. Id. (\"Plaintiffs\npresented no testimony or evidence to the contrary.\").7\n\n        Furthermore, the undisputed fact is that the District did not attempt to block\nany transfers of any children, regardless of race, to KIPP on the basis of any alleged\ndesegregation order or remedy, such as Franklin. Thus, as the district court observed,\n\"[a]ll [District] students, regardless of race, had an equal opportunity to transfer to\nKIPP, just as no [District] students could transfer under the 2013 Act.\" Adkisson,\n2014 WL 6819729, at *6 (emphases added). As the district court observed, the\nappellants have presented no record evidence that the District \"permitted African\nAmerican but not Caucasian students to transfer out of the district.\" Id. (citation\nomitted). Thus, this is not a case in which the District was \"distribut[ing] burdens or\nbenefits on the basis of individual racial classifications.\" Parents Involved in Cmty.\nSchs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 720 (2007). We agree with the district\ncourt that the District's adoption of \"the resolution exempting itself from the 2013 Act\n\n\n\n      7\n       As the district court noted in its order denying the motion for preliminary\ninjunction:\n\n      Plaintiffs did submit a March 1, 2013, Memo to the State Board of\n      Education from the Arkansas Department of Education staff which\n      stated: \"The Arkansas Department of Education is unaware of any\n      pending desegregation orders or decrees affecting either [the Blytheville\n      District or Helena–West Helena District]\" (Hearing Ex. 1; Dkt. No.\n      19–1, at 2). Mr. Atwill testified that, based on conversations he had with\n      a representative of the Equity Department at the Arkansas Department\n      of Education, he disagreed with this characterization. He also questioned\n      what information the Arkansas Department of Education reviewed\n      before making the statement.\n\nStevenson, 955 F. Supp. 2d at 969 (alteration in original).\n\n                                         -26-\n\fimpacted Caucasian and African American students alike.\" Adkisson, 2014 WL\n6819729, at *7.\n\n      As a result, we, like the district court, conclude that the appellants have failed\nto prove a disparate purpose in claiming the exemption and that strict scrutiny does\nnot apply. Therefore, we necessarily address the appellants' alternative rational-basis\nargument.\n\n                                     b. Rational Basis\n       Under rational basis, the appellants \"must prove [that they] w[ere] treated\ndifferently by the [District] than similarly situated persons and the different treatment\nwas not rationally related to a legitimate government objective.\" Koscielski v. City of\nMinneapolis, 435 F.3d 898, 901 (8th Cir. 2006) (emphases added) (citations omitted);\nsee also Flowers v. City of Minneapolis, 558 F.3d 794, 798 (8th Cir. 2009) (\"To\nestablish a violation of the Equal Protection Clause . . . , [the plaintiff] must show that\nhe was treated differently than other persons who were 'in all relevant respects\nsimilarly situated.'\" (citation omitted)). \"To demonstrate this, [the appellants] must\nprove similarity to other individuals . . . receiving favorable treatment.\" Koscielski,\n435 F.3d at 901 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n       The appellants argue that the District treated them differently because it\nallowed intra-district transfers to KIPP but denied the appellants inter-district\ntransfers under the 2013 Act. But, as explained supra, \"[a]ll [District] students,\nregardless of race, had an equal opportunity to transfer to KIPP, just as no [District]\nstudents could transfer under the 2013 Act.\" Adkisson, 2014 WL 6819729, at *6\n(emphases added). We emphasize the lack of any evidence that the District\n\"permitted African American but not Caucasian students to transfer out of the\ndistrict.\" Id. The District's claim of the exemption equally impacted all students,\nregardless of race, as no student could transfer out of the District because of the\nDistrict's taking of the exemption under the 2013 Act.\n\n                                           -27-\n\f       Alternatively, even assuming that differential treatment exists upon which to\nbase an equal protection claim, we conclude that the District had at least a rational\nbasis for believing that the 2013 Act authorized it to take the exemption. First, the\nDistrict could rationally believe that it submitted timely notice of the exemption in\naccordance with the 2013 Act. While the 2013 Act did require the District to \"notify\nthe [ADE] by April 1 if in the next school year the school district intend[ed] to\"\ndeclare an exemption, Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(3), the 2013 Act did not\nbecome effective until April 16, 2013. As we recognized in Teague, the General\nAssembly's intent was \"that the 2013 Act would be effective on the date of its\napproval by the Governor.\" 720 F.3d at 975–76. Because of the purported ambiguity\nregarding whether exemptions were available to school districts for the 2013–14\nschool year, the ADE \"request[ed] that school districts notify the ADE of any\nexemption by Friday, May 17, 2013, so that the \"ADE [could] properly administer\nall aspects of Act 1227 in an orderly fashion.\" The District declared its exemption on\nApril 29, 2013, prior to the issuance of the ADE Memo, but the ADE Memo sets forth\nthe rational basis upon which the District could have also believed that its taking of\nthe exemption for the 2013–14 school year was timely.\n\n        Second, while we decline to hold as a matter of law that the District \"is subject\nto the desegregation order or mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the\neffects of past racial segregation,\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(1), we do hold that\nthe District at least had a rational basis for believing that it \"is subject to the\n. . . mandate of a federal court or agency.\"8 See id. Although the district court entered\nan order dismissing the Franklin case on December 6, 1978, the District \"views the\ncommands set out in the HEW letter [of May 31, 1973] as a mandate by a federal\nagency that it cannot return to the dual school system perpetuated by the 'freedom of\n\n\n      8\n         We decline to address whether the District had a rational basis for believing\nthat it is currently \"subject to [a] desegregation order.\" See id.\n\n                                          -28-\n\fchoice' plan, which Judge Eis[e]le dismantled in 1971.\" (Emphasis added.) The\nDistrict argues that not taking the exemption under the 2013 Act could potentially\n\"dismantle the mandates of\" the DOJ, HEW, and Franklin judgment \"by returning\nNorth Mississippi County to a freedom of choice system, thereby resegregating the\nschool systems.\"\n\n       We conclude that the District could reasonably read the HEW's letter as a\nfederal-agency mandate upon the District to take no action that could result in the\nDistrict returning to the dual-school system dismantled by the Franklin litigation.9\nWhile the HEW letter specifically stated that the District at that time was \"meet[ing]\nthe requirements of Title VI . . . for the purpose of approving applications and plans\nfor continued participation in Federal programs,\" it also indicated that\n\n      [i]n an appropriate proceeding, either the Government or a private party\n      may seek modifications of the desegregation plan or take other action\n      as it may deem necessary. The school district must modify its plan as\n      ordered by the court to remain in compliance. Your office and the\n      school board are requested to keep the Office for Civil Rights informed\n      of any appeals from or modification of the court order.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that the District's taking of the\nexemption under the 2013 Act survives rational-basis review. See Vasquez-Velezmoro\nv. United States I.N.S., 281 F.3d 693, 697 (8th Cir. 2002) (\"The government's\ndifferent treatment of persons will 'be upheld against equal protection challenge if\n\n      9\n       We, as did the district court, reject the argument that the District \"was required\nto distinguish between intradistrict and interdistrict desegregation orders when\ndetermining whether it could adopt the resolution exempting [the District] from the\n2013 Act\" because the 2013 Act \"does not require such an analysis or differentiate\nbetween these types of desegregation orders.\" Adkisson, 2014 WL 6819729, at *14.\n\n                                          -29-\n\fthere is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis\nfor the classification.'\" (quoting FCC v. Beach Commc'n, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313\n(1993)).\n\n                                 III. Conclusion\n      Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\nBEAM, Circuit Judge, concurring and dissenting.\n\n      I concur in the court's general explication concerning the former, and partly\napplicable, terms and conditions of the \"broad school choice transfer option[s],\"\nTeague v. Cooper, 720 F.3d 973, 975 (8th Cir. 2013), contained in Arkansas Code\nAnnotated §§ 6-18-1901 et seq., the Public School Choice Act of 2013 (the 2013\nAct). I also concur in the court's conclusion that a portion of this appeal was mooted\nby the Arkansas General Assembly's repeal of former § 6-18-1906(b), the transfer\nexemption portion of the 2013 Act, upon its enactment of Arkansas Code Annotated\n§ 6-13-113.\n\n       I likewise agree with the court's conclusion that notwithstanding this recent\nlegislative revocation, the appellants remain positioned, upon presentation of\nsatisfactory proof, to recover money damages, costs and fees arising from the\npurposeful and unconstitutional pre-repeal misuse by the Blytheville School District\n(the \"Blytheville District\") of the school choice transfer exemption clause, the now\nabolished § 6-18-1906(b). The 2013 Act remains continuingly viable and fully\nrelevant for purposes of finding and calculating appellants' damages. The\nconstitutionally protected rights at issue include statutorily enforceable property\ninterests in matters of public school choice as well as equal protection violations\narising through the unlawful and unconstitutional use of the previously existing\nschool district transfer exemption apparatus.\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f       I disagree, however, with the court's conclusions that the appellants have failed\nto prove these constitutional violations. To the contrary, the appellants successfully\nestablish both procedural due process and equal protection claims. Accordingly, I\nwould remand the case to the district court to determine all necessary legal and\nfactual issues concerning liability and monetary damages.\n\n                                           I.\n\n       I turn first to an analysis of the specific constitutional claims advanced by the\nappellants. I agree with the court that the appellants fail to prove they have a\nprotected liberty interest. But, the appellants fully succeed on their procedural due\nprocess claim, as the 2013 Act clearly created a protected tangible property interest\nin public school choice and attendance in Arkansas. The court found that appellants\ndid not have a property interest in public school choice because the property interest\ndefined in Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975), was \"the right to participate in the\nentire educational process and not the right to participate in each individual\ncomponent of that process.\" Ante at 19 (quotation omitted). In support, the court\nsays the appellants \"have not been excluded from the educational process\" as they\nwere not prevented from attending public school. Id. (quotation omitted). However,\nthe Legislature of Arkansas statutorily created a much more specific property\ninterest, not just an interest in public school services for the parent and child\nsomewhere in the State of Arkansas. The 2013 Act created for the nonresident\ndistrict applicant a school of the parent and student's \"choice\" in another Arkansas\ndistrict. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 572 (stating that protected interests in property are\ncreated by \"an independent source such as state statutes or rules\"). Unfortunately, the\ncourt attempts to use the statute's exemption clause to improperly slice and dice the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\frelevant property interests created by Goss and the 2013 Act, using inapposite district\ncourt precedent to support its incorrect conclusion.10\n\n       The 2013 Act created justifiable expectations that students could \"attend a\nschool in a nonresident district.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(a) (2013). Although\nthe 2013 Act gave the nonresident school district the discretion to decide whether to\naccept a student seeking transfer, id. § 6-18-1903(d)(1), the terms of the 2013 Act\nillustrate that the legislature envisioned that the capacity of the nonresident school\ndistrict would be the only and exclusive determining factor as to whether the\nnonresident school district accepted a student's transfer application. See id. § 6-18-\n1903(d)(2), (3) (prohibiting a nonresident district from considering an applicant's\nacademic achievements, athletic or other extracurricular ability, English proficiency\nlevel, or disciplinary record in evaluating their application for transfer).11\nAdditionally, the 2013 Act provided that a nonresident district had to state a reason\n\n      10\n        The 2013 Act's broad school choice transfer option as recognized by Teague\nauthorizes the transfer of the \"entire educational process,\" as it is defined by Goss.\nAnte at 19 (quotation omitted). And, the district court opinion cited by the court,\nMazevski v. Horseheads Central School District, 950 F. Supp. 69 (W.D.N.Y. 1997),\ndoes not support a contrary holding. Mazevski deals not with a nonresident,\ninterschool district transfer of the entire educational experience as is contemplated\nby the 2013 Act and appellants. Rather, the limitation imposed in Mazevski involved\na single student being precluded from performing with his school's marching\nband–from which he was dismissed for individual misconduct. The 2013 Act's\nexemption clause was in no way designed to create \"individual component[s]\" of the\nArkansas educational experience–it was a broad administrative procedure improperly\nemployed in this case to wholly abort the appellants' children's entire educational\nprocess in a nonresident district of their parents' choice.\n      11\n         And, in fact, aside from the applicant's personal information–name, age, grade\nlevel, home address, etc.–the only other information the application for transfer under\nthe 2013 Act requested was the name and address of the applicant's resident school\ndistrict and the name and address of the nonresident school district the applicant\nwished to attend.\n\n                                         -32-\n\ffor the rejection if the student's transfer application was not accepted. Id. § 6-18-\n1905(b)(2). Finally, the 2013 Act provided that an applicant whose transfer\napplication was rejected was entitled to a hearing before the state board to reconsider\nthe transfer, as long as she submitted a request for the hearing in writing within ten\ndays after receipt of her rejection. Id. § 6-18-1907(b)(1), (2)(A). Thus, as later\nexplained in more detail, the public school choice transfer right established in the\n2013 Act was more than \"a mere subjective expectancy of school choice,\" ante at 20.\nUnder the 2013 Act, the appellants had a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" id. at 18\n(quotation omitted), to \"choose from among different schools with differing assets,\"\nArk. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(1) (2013), and when the Blytheville District wrongly\nand unconstitutionally exempted itself from the 2013 Act, the Blytheville District\nunlawfully deprived appellants of their protected property interest and hearing rights.\nThe appellants clearly establish that the Blytheville District did not afford them\nadequate and statutorily specified procedural rights designed to protect their\nconstitutionally protected property interests, and thus the Blytheville District violated\nthe appellants' due process rights, see ante at 15, for which violations the appellants\nare entitled to monetary damages.12\n\n      12\n         In a further attempt to void this statutorily established and constitutionally\nprotected school transfer prerogative, the district court and this court seek to\ndisembowel and thus, overrule the thrust of the Supreme Court's holding in Goss. To\ndo so, the district court and this court assert that the 2013 Act created only a \"mere\nsubjective expectancy of school choice.\" Ante at 20. In this effort, this court cites\na series of inapplicable rules, irrelevant dictionary definitions and inapposite case\nlaw. The court accurately states, and then disregards, the fact that the only limiting\nacceptance choice the 2013 Act provides a receiving school district concerning a\ntransferring student's property right is the student \"capacity\" of such receiving school.\nBut, in this dispute, the unlawful Blytheville District exemption claim sought to and\ndid miscarry any attempt by the appellants to test this \"capacity\" question in the\nputative receiving districts. How this de minimis and untested capacity limitation can\nbe allowed to derail the appellants' constitutionally protected property interests,\nwithout a statutorily required hearing of any nature, is not explained or even\naddressed by this court.\n\n                                          -33-\n\f                                           II.\n\n        I also disagree with the court's analysis of appellants' demand for damages\nunder their equal protection claims. Despite the court's finding to the contrary, see\nid. at 26-27, nothing in the record in this case generated \"at least a rational basis for\n[Blytheville District's] believing that the 2013 Act authorized it to take the\n\n\n\n       The court's sole cited precedent for this unsupportable \"subjective expectancy\"\ncontention is an unpublished Fifth Circuit case, Horton v. City of Smithville, 117 F.\nApp'x 345, 347-48 (5th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). Strangely, this case deals not with\na constitutionally protected property interest, but with whether the appellant, Horton,\nhad a property interest in the City of Smithville's lack of enforcement of the city's\nzoning ordinance prohibiting the staging of a live music event on a neighbor's\nproperty. The answer by the court was that he did not. Id. at 348. However, what\nlight the Horton decision sheds upon whether the appellants in this case have an\nactionable constitutionally based property interest granted by the Arkansas statute is\nwholly shaded. And importantly, the Horton case is of dubious force as citable\nprecedent since the Fifth Circuit attaches no precedential value to an unpublished\nopinion, Fifth Circuit Appellate Rule 47.5.4, and neither does this circuit. Eighth\nCircuit Appellate Rule 32.1A.\n\n       It is also worth mentioning that the Arkansas statute explicitly states that a\n\"school district receiving transfers under this [school choice] act shall not\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, or\ndisability.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(d)(3). Thus, it is patently inconsistent with\nthe general racial policies established in the 2013 Act that the Board of Directors of\nthe Blytheville District should now attempt to oppose appellants' school transfer\nefforts with its letter of April 22, 2015, to the Arkansas Department of Education\n(ADE), which letter raises issues of \"desegregation obligations . . . (i.e., the creation,\nmaintaining, or increasing of racially identifiable schools).\" Ante at 13. Such issues\nwere put to rest by Judge Eisele's interdicting dismissal order of December 6, 1978.\nThis is an especially questionable argument by the Blytheville District given the blind\neye presented by its Board of Directors to the 250 student exodus in 2009 mostly\nfrom the Blytheville District to the Kipp Delta Academy School \"the majority of\nwhom [were] African Americans or other minorities.\" Ante at 24.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fexemption.\" Id. at 28. Indeed, the record clearly prevented the Blytheville District\nfrom nullifying appellants' attempted transfers to the nonresident district. No\nreasonable reading of Franklin v. Board of Education of the Blytheville, Arkansas,\nSchool District No. 5, No. J-71-C-35 (E.D. Ark.), allowed the Blytheville District to\nbelieve it was still subject to a desegregation order of any nature.\n\n        Judge Eisele on August 19, 1971, entered an order that approved Blytheville\nDistrict's desegregation plan for its high school, junior high schools, and elementary\nschools. In that same order, the court further approved the Blytheville District's\ndesegregation plan with respect to faculty and administrative staff assignments–with\nfour minor reservations. On June 21, 1973, Judge Eisele, noted that the items\nreserved as mentioned above \"are no longer a subject of controversy\" and closed the\ncase, reserving jurisdiction \"for necessary and appropriate purposes.\" Five years\nlater, on December 6, 1978, Judge Eisele issued an order fully dismissing the Franklin\ncase. Thus, the plain language of these orders leaves no doubt that the Franklin court\nclosed the case and ultimately ceded jurisdiction over the case and the parties.\nTherefore, as earlier noted, the Blytheville District had no rational basis for believing\nit was still subject to a desegregation order, and consequently no means of lawfully\nexempting itself from the 2013 Act.13 The Blytheville District's violation of the 2013\n\n\n      13\n         As the court notes, the Blytheville District also claims that a May 31, 1973,\nletter sent from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\n(HEW) is a \"mandate by a federal agency that it cannot return to the dual school\nsystem.\" Ante at 28. The record is clear that this claimed continuing mandate is\nunfounded. The HEW letter stated that the Blytheville District \"must modify its\n[desegregation] plan as may be ordered by the court to remain in compliance.\"\n(Emphasis added.). Less than a month later, Judge Eisele issued his June 21, 1973,\norder finding that the matters mentioned in the HEW letter were \"no longer a subject\nof controversy\" and he then closed the case. The timing of Judge Eisele's June 21,\n1973, order in relation to the May 31, 1973, HEW letter obviously establishes that he\nfelt no further modification of the desegregation plan was necessary for the school\ndistrict to \"remain in compliance.\" Further, once Judge Eisele ceded jurisdiction in\n\n                                          -35-\n\fAct and the subsequent disparate treatment that resulted–allowing intra-district\ntransfers to the Kipp Delta charter school, but denying appellants' inter-district\ntransfers under the 2013 Act–violated appellants' equal protection rights, for which\nappellants are entitled to monetary damages.\n\n       The district court strangely found–apparently responding to Blytheville\nDistrict's wholly frivolous contention that Judge Eisele's order should have contained\nsome \"unitary school system\" language–that even after the passage of at least thirty-\nseven years of Blytheville District's lawful operation as a unitary (non-dual) school\n\n\n\nthe case over the parties through his December 6, 1978, order, the court no longer\nretained any authority to order the school district to modify its desegregation plan.\nThus, HEW's May 31, 1973, letter, on its own, cannot credibly be read as a \"mandate\nof a federal . . . agency remedying the effects of past racial segregation,\" because the\nletter instructs the school district to follow any order \"by the court,\" which later\nclosed the case and ceded jurisdiction over the parties. As a result, since at least 1978\nthere has no longer been an active desegregation plan which the government or a\nprivate party could \"seek modification of,\" and there is also no way for the\nBlytheville District to fall out of compliance with a long since-closed desegregation\norder.\n\n       The district court and this court found credible the Blytheville District's\nargument that the February 11, 1971, HEW letter to the school district and the May\n31, 1973, HEW letter to the ADE continue to stand as \"active mandates\" prohibiting\nchanges that in any manner increase \"racially identifiable schools.\" In this case, the\nBlytheville District's argument obviously means not permitting any \"Caucasian\"\nexodus from the district. This active mandate stands, according to the Blytheville\nDistrict, and now this court, notwithstanding Judge Eisele's interdiction order of\nDecember 6, 1978, and according to the record in this case, the passage of at least\nthirty-seven years of the Blytheville District's operation of a desegregated \"unitary\nnon-racial\" school system and accompanied by no evidence of any activities causing\nsubstantial racial imbalance changes in the district except, perhaps, the Blytheville\nDistrict's authorized movement of the 250 students to Kipp Delta Academy in 2009.\nAnte at 24.\n\n                                          -36-\n\fsystem, the Blytheville District was still subject to a Franklin desegregation order.\nThis was error. The district court's incorrect holding that Judge Eisele, in Franklin,\nshould have made a specific finding that the Blytheville District had achieved unitary\nstatus in order to properly dismiss the August 1971 desegregation action is based on\ninapposite cases and faulty analysis of applicable law. Indeed, at the time the\nFranklin court dismissed the action in 1978, there was no case law requiring a finding\nof unitary status in order to properly close a desegregation order. The two cases the\ndistrict court relies on for the requirement that a finding of unitary status is necessary\nare Jenkins by Jenkins v. State of Missouri, 122 F.3d 588 (8th Cir. 1997), and Lockett\nv. Board of Education of Muscogee County, 92 F.3d 1092 (11th Cir. 1996). Not only\nwere these two cases decided nearly two decades after Franklin, both cases are\nfactually distinguishable from Franklin. In Lockett, the court ordered the school\ndistrict to present and implement a desegregation plan in 1971 and continued to\nmaintain jurisdiction over the case into the 1990s, even though the district court\n\"ignored the school district's actions after 1980.\" Id. at 1097-98. Similarly in\nJenkins, the district court still had jurisdiction over the desegregation action, and\naction in the case was ongoing, into the 1990s. Jenkins by Jenkins, 122 F.3d at 590-\n91. Conversely, in Franklin, the case was dismissed for all purposes and without\nappeal in 1978, long before the case law established, if any binding litigation ever\nhas, any precedent that required district courts to make an express finding of unitary\nstatus. In sum, the unitary status contention frivolously asserted by the Blytheville\nDistrict and wrongly accepted by the district court was simply an unsupportable\nexcuse for improperly urging a non-existent transfer exemption–not a basis for the\ndistrict court's interference with the transfers.\n\n       Contrary to the district court's findings, the Franklin court had done all that was\nrequired to close the case. When the Franklin case was dismissed in 1978, if a school\ndistrict had achieved the objectives of a desegregation order, the district court's\nremedial authority over those objectives was ended and the injunction was dissolved.\nSee Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 436-37 (1976). Judge\n\n                                          -37-\n\fEisele's actions in the Franklin case make clear that he believed the Blytheville\nDistrict had achieved the objectives of all desegregation orders. Thus there is no\ncredible evidence that the Blytheville District has been subject to a desegregation\norder related to the Franklin case since December 6, 1978.\n\n       Penultimately, with regard to the Blytheville District's transfer exemption\nclaim, I note that the Board of Directors of the Blytheville District do not and cannot\ndeny that they, and their predecessor Boards, have actually operated a desegregated\nunitary public school system since at least 1978. There also appears to be no\nevidence in this case, or even any claims, that a dual, segregated public school system\nor any vestiges of the same has in any way operated since Judge Eisele's final order\nin 1978. Accordingly, the Blytheville District's exemption claims were, in substance,\nwholly specious.\n\n       Finally, in the alternative, the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of the Blytheville District. Summary judgment is only proper if\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A district court's\nfinding of unitary status is a finding of fact, reviewed for clear error. Fisher v.\nTucson Unified School Dist., 652 F.3d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir. 2011). In the instant case\nthen, if there is a genuine dispute as to whether there is or is not unitary status, as\nseemingly advanced by the Blytheville District, the granting of summary judgment\nto the Blytheville District was erroneous.\n\n      For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent on the issue of the\nappellants' damages arising from their procedural due process and equal protection\nclaims and would remand the issues back to the district court to determine monetary\ndamages, costs, and fees.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f",

Acts 1227 (Apr. 16,\n2013), codified at Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1901 et seq. The 2013 Act contained a\n\"broad school choice transfer option.\" Teague v.

But the 2013 Act also contained limitations. In relevant part, it provided that\n\"[a] school district annually may declare an exemption under this section if the school\ndistrict is subject to the desegregation order or mandate of a federal court or agency\nremedying the effects of past racial segregation.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1906(b)(1)\n(2013). The 2013 Act required a school district to \"notify the [Arkansas Department\nof Education] by April 1\" if the district intends to declare an exemption \"in the next\nschool year.\" Id. § 6–18–1906(b)(3). The \"exemptions under the 2013 Act are limited\nto individual school districts that are subject to federal desegregation mandates.\"\nTeague, 720 F.3d at 977 n.2.\n\n       Heath Adkisson, Lori Adkisson, Ryan Braswell, Melissa Braswell, Oliver\nCoppedge, Tracy Coppedge, George A.

The appellants applied to transfer their\nchildren from the District to neighboring school districts, but the District's Board of\nDirectors subsequently adopted a resolution to exempt the District from the 2013 Act\nunder § 6–18–1906(b) on the basis that the District \"is subject to a desegregation\norder or mandate of a federal court of [sic] agency remedying the effects of past racial\nsegregation.\" The appellants brought suit against the District, alleging that the District\nviolated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the 2013–2014 school year,\nto opt out under § 6–18–1906(b) of the 2013 Act.

As relief, the appellants requested a\ndeclaration and permanent injunction against the District, as well as damages\nallegedly stemming from their due process claims. The appellants also sought\npunitive damages for the District's allegedly race-based conduct. The appellants\nmoved for partial summary judgment, and the District filed a counter-motion for\nsummary judgment. The district court2 denied the appellants' motion for partial\nsummary judgment but granted the District's counter-motion for summary judgment.\nThe court denied the appellants' request for a declaration, permanent injunction, and\ndamages. On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment to the District because the undisputed facts show that the District\n(1) violated due process by abusing its power under state law and failing to provide\npre-deprivation process, and (2) violated equal protection by using race as the reason\nfor its exemption and nullifying the 2013 Act within its borders on the pretense that\nit was subject to a desegregation order. We affirm.\n\n                                    I. Background\n                               A. Statutory Background\n       Despite containing a \"broad school choice transfer option,\" Teague, 720 F.3d\nat 976, the 2013 Act also enabled certain resident school districts to restrict or defeat\na student's ability to transfer to a nonresident district. See Ark. Code Ann.\n§ 6–18–1906(a)–(b) (2013). One of those limitations set forth an exemption for a\nqualifying school district, providing:\n\n      (b) (1) A school district annually may declare an exemption under this\n      section if the school district is subject to the desegregation order or\n      mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past racial\n      segregation.\n\n\n\n      2\n       The Honorable Kristine G. Baker, United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f             (2)(A) An exemption declared by a board of directors under this\n             subsection is irrevocable for one (1) year from the date the school\n             district notifies the Department of Education of the declaration of\n             exemption.\n\n                    (B) After each year of exemption, the board of directors\n                    may elect to participate in public school choice under this\n                    section if the school district's participation does not\n                    conflict with the school district's federal court-ordered\n                    desegregation program.\n\n             (3) A school district shall notify the department by April 1 if in\n             the next school year the school district intends to:\n\n                    (A) Declare an exemption under this section; or\n\n                    (B) Resume participation after a period of exemption.\n\nId. § 6–18–1906(b).\n\n       The General Assembly's intent was \"that the 2013 Act would be effective on\nthe date of its approval by the Governor.\" Teague, 720 F.3d at 975–76. It specifically\nstated its intent to dispel any \"'uncertainty about the viability of [existing] transfers\nand future transfers'\" and that the 2013 Act was \"'immediately necessary to resolve\nthe uncertainty in the law before the 2013-2014 school year and preserve existing\nstudent transfers.'\" Id. at 976 (emphasis added) (quoting Act 1227, 2013 Ark. Acts\n1227, § 7 (Apr. 16, 2013)). But the General Assembly enacted the 2013 Act on April\n16, 2013—15 days past the April 1 deadline to declare an exemption as provided in\n§ 6–181–906(b)(3). As a result, on May 1, 2013, the Arkansas Department of\nEducation (ADE)3 released a memo that stated:\n\n\n      3\n        The 2013 Act provides that the \"State Board of Education may promulgate\nrules to implement\" the 2013 Act. Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1907 (2013).\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      As noted above, Act 1227 did not become effective until April 16, 2013.\n      However, the [2013] Act sets April 1 as the date by which a school\n      district must notify the ADE of its intention to declare an exemption for\n      participation in public school choice under the [2013] Act. The ADE\n      will not attempt to reestablish a deadline that is set in law. However, so\n      school districts and the ADE can properly administer all aspects of Act\n      1227 in an orderly fashion and so that parents, students, patrons and\n      school district leaders may be aware of those school districts which are\n      subject to desegregation orders or federal agency mandates remedying\n      the effects of past racial segregation, the ADE requests that school\n      districts notify the ADE of any exemption by Friday, May 17, 2013. . . .\n\n      Contemporaneous with notice to the ADE, the ADE also requests that\n      school districts notify the superintendents of each of their\n      geographically contiguous school districts of the exemption. Please note\n      that Act 1227 does not provide the ADE the authority to rule a particular\n      exemption valid or invalid. However, the Act does allow for such\n      exemptions if \"the school district is subject to the desegregation order\n      or mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the effects of past\n      racial segregation.\" The ADE will post a list of school districts that\n      declare an exemption on its website.\n\n      The 2013 Act also provided that the parents of students seeking to transfer to\nattend a school in a nonresident district had to submit an application to the\nnonresident district with a copy to the resident district on a form approved by the\nADE and postmarked no later than June 1 of the year in which the student sought to\nbegin the fall semester at the nonresident district. Ark. Code Ann. § 6–18–1905(a)\n(2013). By August 1 of the school year in which the student sought enrollment in a\nnonresident district, the superintendent of the nonresident district had to notify the\nparent and the resident district in writing as to whether the student's application had\nbeen accepted or rejected. Id. § 6–18–1905(b)(1). If the nonresident district accepted\nthe application, then the notification letter had to include the deadline by which the\nstudent had to enroll in the nonresident district, after which the acceptance was null,\nand instructions for the renewal procedure that the nonresident district established.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fId. § 6–18–1905(b)(3). If the nonresident district rejected the application, then the\nnotification letter had to state the reason for the rejection. Id. § 6–18–1905(b)(2).\n\n       Students whose applications for transfer were rejected by the nonresident\ndistrict could request a hearing before the Arkansas State Board of Education (\"Board\nof Education\") to reconsider the transfer. Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(1). The 2013 Act\nrequired that a student request in writing an appeal hearing within ten days after the\nstudent or student's parent received the notification letter. Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(2)(A).\n\"As part of the review process, the parent may submit supporting documentation that\nthe transfer would be in the best educational, social, or psychological interest of the\nstudent.\" Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(2)(B). The Board of Education could overturn the\nnonresident district's decision on appeal; if it did so, then it had to notify \"the parent,\nthe nonresident district, and the resident district of the basis for the state board's\ndecision.\" Id. § 6–18–1907(b)(3).\n\n                      B. Factual and Procedural Background\n       As of April 29, 2013, appellants Heath and Lori Adkisson, Ryan and Melissa\nBraswell, Oliver and Tracy Coppedge, George and Stephanie Hale, and Jeff and\nMissy Langston were residents of and had children who resided in the District.\nBetween April 19, 2013, and April 26, 2013, each appellant submitted an application\non behalf of one of their children for transfer from the District to a nonresident\ndistrict under the 2013 Act for the school year beginning in fall of 2013. Each child\nfor whom a transfer was sought is Caucasian. The District received the appellants'\napplications between April 22, 2013, and April 26, 2013.\n\n      On April 29, 2013, the District met in a special session after notifying the press\nunder the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act open-meetings law. According to the\nappellants, the District did not notify them of the special session. At that special\nmeeting, the District's Board of Education adopted a resolution by a vote of six to\nzero to declare the District exempt under the 2013 Act. Richard Atwill,\n\n                                           -6-\n\fsuperintendent of the District, informed the ADE of the resolution and exemption by\nletter dated May 9, 2013, received by the ADE on May 14, 2013.4\n\n       The District declared the exemption in April 2013 based in part on Franklin v.\nBoard of Education of Blytheville School District No. 5, U.S.D.C. No. J–71–C–35\n(E.D. Ark.). The history of the Franklin litigation begins on July 19, 1968, when the\nRegional Director of the Office of Civil Rights at the United States Department of\nHealth, Education, and Welfare (HEW) sent a letter to the District approving the\ndistrict's \"plan for the complete elimination of the dual school system in the\nBlytheville Public Schools.\"\n\n       According to the District's plan, the \"District was to be completely\ndesegregated by the beginning of the 1970–71 school year.\" But the HEW's onsite\naudit of the District\n\n      on October 6, 1970, revealed that [the District's] commitment to a\n      desegregated system had not been implemented in that the Robinson and\n      Franklin Elementary Schools remain[ed] identifiably Negro schools.\n      Under the freedom of choice plan which [was] still in [the District's]\n      elementary schools, there [were] no white students in either of these\n      schools.\n\nBased on the audit, the Director of the Office for Civil Rights of the HEW sent a\nletter to the District on February 11, 1971, confirming that \"because of the failure of\nthe [District] to convert to a unitary school system the matter was being referred to\n[the Department of Justice (DOJ)] with a recommendation that appropriate\nenforcement action be initiated.\" On May 12, 1971, the District requested \"a one-year\n\n\n\n      4\n      On March 31, 2014, the District renewed its claim of exemption under the\n2013 Act.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fcontinuance of the present freedom of choice plan of school desegregation for the\nelementary schools in the [District].\"\n\n       On June 18, 1971, the DOJ denied the District's request, stating that the DOJ\nwas \"unable to approve the [D]istrict's continued operation under a freedom of choice\nplan of school desegregation.\" According to the DOJ, six elementary schools within\nthe District contained five racially identifiable white or black schools. It explained\nthat school desegregation could not be delayed because of \"possible community\nopposition to a change in the elementary school structure.\" The DOJ gave the District\nten days within which to advise the DOJ of \"what plans the Blytheville School Board\nhas taken and what procedures have been adopted to [e]nsure that such plans will be\nimplemented at the beginning of the 1971–72 school year, for full conversion of the\n[District] to a unitary non-racial system.\" The DOJ expressed its \"hope that the\nBlytheville School Board w[ould] not delay in [its] obligation to convert to a unitary\nsystem and that compliance c[ould] be brought about by voluntary means rather than\nby resort to the coercion of the courts.\"\n\n      Nonetheless, litigation ensued, as African-American parents filed suit on July\n7, 1971, against the District seeking to enjoin the District from continuing to operate\na dual school system and to require it to implement a unitary school system. See\nFranklin, U.S.D.C. No. J–71–C–35. On August 19, 1971, the district court in\nFranklin entered an order approving the District's desegregation plan, with the\nexception of certain identified issues, ending its \"freedom of choice\" plan that was\npreviously rejected by the HEW and the DOJ.\n\n      On May 31, 1973, the HEW sent a letter to the ADE advising that the HEW\nhad reviewed the district court's desegregation order, as well as the District's\nassurance of compliance with that order, and determined that \"[t]he documents [were]\nadequate\" to satisfy Title VI requirements \"for the purpose of approving applications\nand plans for continued participation in Federal programs.\" But the HEW made clear\n\n                                         -8-\n\fthat it had not considered the merits of the District's desegregation plan and advised\nthat,\n\n      [i]n an appropriate proceeding, either the Government or a private party\n      may seek modifications of the desegregation plan or take other action as\n      it may deem necessary. The school district must modify its plan as\n      ordered by the court to remain in compliance. Your office and the school\n      board are requested to keep the Office for Civil Rights informed of any\n      appeals from or modification of the court order.\n\n       On June 21, 1973, the district court entered an order closing the case but\nretaining jurisdiction. The district court stated in this order that,\n\n      [o]n the basis of correspondence with counsel for the parties, the Court\n      concludes that issues reserved in the Court's order [approving the\n      District's desegregation plan] are no longer a subject of controversy.\n      There being no pending issues in this preceding, it is ordered that this\n      case be, and it is hereby, closed but that the Court retain jurisdiction of\n      this cause and of the parties hereto for necessary and appropriate\n      purposes.\n\n       On December 6, 1978, the district court entered an order dismissing the case\nbecause, since closing it, \"the Court ha[d] received no further communication\nconcerning this case.\" Three days later, on December 9, 1978, plaintiffs' counsel sent\nthe district court a letter that stated:\n\n      The Court sua[]sponte closed this case. I am writing to remind the Court\n      that there is no finding by the Court that a unitary school system has\n      been achieved, and there is no order requiring the school district to\n      hereafter maintain an integrated system in all respects. Finally, the Court\n      did not award the prevailing parties appropriate costs and counsel fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      With respect to the establishment of a unitary school system, I think the\n      obligation of the Court is to make some further inquiry and to also\n      [e]nsure that faculty and staff desegregation principles are clearly\n      expressed.\n\n      I am bringing these matters to the Court's attention in the hope that the\n      Court will rescind its order and judgment filed December 7 and\n      substitute an order requiring the defendants to provide the Court\n      something in the nature of a comprehensive final report which relates to\n      students, staff, programs and facilities.\n\nThe district court in Franklin took no further action.\n\n       The appellants filed this action on May 20, 2013, alleging that the District\nviolated their constitutional rights when it resolved, for the 2013–2014 school year,\nto opt out under § 6–18–1906(b) of the 2013 Act. They sued for violations of their\ndue process and equal protection rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and for violations of\nthe ACRA. As relief, the appellants requested a declaration and permanent injunction\nagainst the District, as well as damages allegedly stemming from their due process\nclaims and punitive damages for the District's allegedly race-based conduct.\n\n      The appellants also sought a preliminary injunction requiring the District to\nrescind its resolution declaring the exemption for the 2013–2014 school year under\nthe 2013 Act. The district court denied the preliminary injunction, and the appellants\nappealed. We dismissed the appeal as moot given the \"clear terms of the motion,\"\nwhich provided that the motion pertained to the 2013–2014 school year. Stevenson,\n762 F.3d at 770.\n\n      Thereafter, the appellants moved for partial summary judgment on their claims,\nand the District moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court denied\nthe appellants' motion for partial summary judgment but granted the District's\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fcounter-motion for summary judgment. The court denied the appellants' request for\na declaration, permanent injunction, and damages.\n\n                                    II. Discussion\n       On appeal, the appellants argue that the district court erred in granting\nsummary judgment to the District because the undisputed facts show that the District\n(1) violated their due process rights by abusing its power under state law and failing\nto provide pre-deprivation process, and (2) violated their equal protection rights by\nusing race as the reason for its exemption and nullifying the 2013 Act within its\nborders on the pretense that it was subject to a desegregation order.5\n\n                                    A. Mootness\n       As a preliminary matter, we must address whether the current appeal is moot\nin light of recent events. Prior to oral argument, the Arkansas General Assembly\npassed Act 560, which became law on March 20, 2015. The statute amends the 2013\nAct, striking former § 6-18-1906(b), the section at issue in this appeal, and adding\n§ 6-13-113, which provides:\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        The Arkansas Constitution secures the right to not be deprived of any right,\nprivilege or immunity on account of race. Ark. Const. Art. 2, § 3. The ACRA also\nenables a cause of action for legal and equitable relief for state constitutional\nviolations. Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-101, et seq. \"When construing [the ACRA], a\ncourt may look for guidance to state and federal decisions interpreting the federal\nCivil Rights Act of 1871, as amended and codified in 42 U.S.C. § 1983, as in effect\non January 1, 1993, which decisions and act shall have persuasive authority only.\"\nArk. Code Ann. § 16-123-105(c). Based on § 16-123-105(c), the appellants advise\nthat \"they have analyzed their § 1983 and ACRA claims together for purposes of this\nappeal.\" We, too, will analyze the appellants' § 1983 and ACRA equal protection and\ndue process claims together.\n\n                                        -11-\n\f      (a) By January 1, 2016, a school district that is subject to a\n      desegregation order or desegregation-related order shall notify the\n      Department of Education in writing.\n\n      (b) A school district that is subject to a desegregation order or a\n      desegregation-related order shall include in the written notice to the\n      department:\n\n            (1) A copy of the desegregation order or desegregation-related\n            order;\n\n            (2) The case heading and case number of each court case in which\n            the order was entered;\n\n            (3) The name and location of each court that maintains\n            jurisdiction over the order; and\n\n            (4) A description of the school choice student transfer\n            desegregation obligations, if any, that the school district is subject\n            to, related to the order.\n\n      (c) A school district that is released from court supervision related to a\n      desegregation order or desegregation-related order shall promptly notify\n      the department.\n\n      (d) A school district that fails to meet the requirements of this section is\n      in violation of the Standards for Accreditation of Arkansas Public\n      Schools and School Districts.\n\n      (e) The department shall post on the department's website all written\n      notifications received as required by this section.\n\nArk. Code Ann. § 6-13-113 (2015).\n\n     Following oral argument, on April 22, 2015, the District sent a letter to the\nADE claiming the exemption under § 6-13-113, explaining that it\n\n                                         -12-\n\f      is a party to the following desegregation lawsuits that are still active:\n      mandates issued in 1971 by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S.\n      Department of Health, Education and Welfare; Franklin, et al. v.\n      Blytheville School District No. 5, U.S.D.C.

The desegregation obligations of these cases\n      prohibit the District from taking any action, or refraining from taking\n      any action, the natural and probable consequence of which would be a\n      segregative impact within the District (i.e., the creation, maintaining, or\n      increasing of racially identifiable schools). Permitting school choice\n      under the Acts would have such an impact. Allowing school choice\n      would, therefore, be in conflict with the District's desegregation\n      obligation still outstanding. The District further relies upon Ark.

Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(a)\n(2013). It required each school district to \"adopt by resolution specific standards for\nacceptance and rejection of applications.\" Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(1). In setting forth its\nstandards, the Act permitted school districts to \"include without limitation the\ncapacity of a program, class, grade level, or school building.\" Id. § 6-18-\n1903(d)(2)(A). The 2013 Act required school districts to give priority to applicants\nwith siblings or stepsiblings residing in the same household who were \"already\nenrolled in the nonresident district by choice.\" Id. § 6-18-1903(d)(2)(B)(i)–(ii). In\nsetting forth standards, the 2013 Act prohibited school districts from considering an\napplicant's academic achievement, athletic ability, extracurricular ability, English\nproficiency level, and prior disciplinary record.

The 2013 Act directed nonresident districts to\nnotify an applicant and the resident district in writing as to whether the nonresident\ndistrict had accepted or rejected the application by August 1 of the school year in\nwhich the applicant sought to enroll.

In reviewing whether the appellants\nhave a protected property interest, we must examine what the 2013 Act provides to\nthe appellants.

In support of their argument, the appellants cite the testimony\nof the District's superintendent at the hearing on the appellants' motion for\npreliminary injunction. At that hearing, the superintendent explained that he\nrecommended that the District opt out of the 2013 Act based on his \"opinion that the\ndistrict was still part of a desegregation order.\" When asked how he formed that\nopinion, the superintendent responded, \"By looking back over some archival data that\nwe have in the district from past cases and from some law history,\" which included\nthe Franklin case. The superintendent testified that he reviewed this \"archival\ninformation\" in 2013 and 2012.

This evidence relates to the Board of Education's approval in\n2009 of an open-enrollment charter school—KIPP Delta Academy (KIPP). KIPP\neducates about 250 students, most of whom come from the District and the majority\nof whom are African American or other minorities.

We emphasize the lack of any evidence that the District\n\"permitted African American but not Caucasian students to transfer out of the\ndistrict.\" Id. The District's claim of the exemption equally impacted all students,\nregardless of race, as no student could transfer out of the District because of the\nDistrict's taking of the exemption under the 2013 Act.\n\n                                           -27-\n\f       Alternatively, even assuming that differential treatment exists upon which to\nbase an equal protection claim, we conclude that the District had at least a rational\nbasis for believing that the 2013 Act authorized it to take the exemption. First, the\nDistrict could rationally believe that it submitted timely notice of the exemption in\naccordance with the 2013 Act. While the 2013 Act did require the District to \"notify\nthe [ADE] by April 1 if in the next school year the school district intend[ed] to\"\ndeclare an exemption, Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(3), the 2013 Act did not\nbecome effective until April 16, 2013. As we recognized in Teague, the General\nAssembly's intent was \"that the 2013 Act would be effective on the date of its\napproval by the Governor.\" 720 F.3d at 975–76. Because of the purported ambiguity\nregarding whether exemptions were available to school districts for the 2013–14\nschool year, the ADE \"request[ed] that school districts notify the ADE of any\nexemption by Friday, May 17, 2013, so that the \"ADE [could] properly administer\nall aspects of Act 1227 in an orderly fashion.\" The District declared its exemption on\nApril 29, 2013, prior to the issuance of the ADE Memo, but the ADE Memo sets forth\nthe rational basis upon which the District could have also believed that its taking of\nthe exemption for the 2013–14 school year was timely.\n\n        Second, while we decline to hold as a matter of law that the District \"is subject\nto the desegregation order or mandate of a federal court or agency remedying the\neffects of past racial segregation,\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1906(b)(1), we do hold that\nthe District at least had a rational basis for believing that it \"is subject to the\n. . . mandate of a federal court or agency.\"8 See id. Although the district court entered\nan order dismissing the Franklin case on December 6, 1978, the District \"views the\ncommands set out in the HEW letter [of May 31, 1973] as a mandate by a federal\nagency that it cannot return to the dual school system perpetuated by the 'freedom of\n\n\n      8\n         We decline to address whether the District had a rational basis for believing\nthat it is currently \"subject to [a] desegregation order.\" See id.\n\n                                          -28-\n\fchoice' plan, which Judge Eis[e]le dismantled in 1971.\" (Emphasis added.) The\nDistrict argues that not taking the exemption under the 2013 Act could potentially\n\"dismantle the mandates of\" the DOJ, HEW, and Franklin judgment \"by returning\nNorth Mississippi County to a freedom of choice system, thereby resegregating the\nschool systems.\"\n\n       We conclude that the District could reasonably read the HEW's letter as a\nfederal-agency mandate upon the District to take no action that could result in the\nDistrict returning to the dual-school system dismantled by the Franklin litigation.9\nWhile the HEW letter specifically stated that the District at that time was \"meet[ing]\nthe requirements of Title VI . . . for the purpose of approving applications and plans\nfor continued participation in Federal programs,\" it also indicated that\n\n      [i]n an appropriate proceeding, either the Government or a private party\n      may seek modifications of the desegregation plan or take other action\n      as it may deem necessary. The school district must modify its plan as\n      ordered by the court to remain in compliance. Your office and the\n      school board are requested to keep the Office for Civil Rights informed\n      of any appeals from or modification of the court order.\n\n(Emphases added.)\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, we hold that the District's taking of the\nexemption under the 2013 Act survives rational-basis review.

I also concur in the court's conclusion that a portion of this appeal was mooted\nby the Arkansas General Assembly's repeal of former § 6-18-1906(b), the transfer\nexemption portion of the 2013 Act, upon its enactment of Arkansas Code Annotated\n§ 6-13-113.\n\n       I likewise agree with the court's conclusion that notwithstanding this recent\nlegislative revocation, the appellants remain positioned, upon presentation of\nsatisfactory proof, to recover money damages, costs and fees arising from the\npurposeful and unconstitutional pre-repeal misuse by the Blytheville School District\n(the \"Blytheville District\") of the school choice transfer exemption clause, the now\nabolished § 6-18-1906(b). The 2013 Act remains continuingly viable and fully\nrelevant for purposes of finding and calculating appellants' damages. The\nconstitutionally protected rights at issue include statutorily enforceable property\ninterests in matters of public school choice as well as equal protection violations\narising through the unlawful and unconstitutional use of the previously existing\nschool district transfer exemption apparatus.\n\n\n\n                                        -30-\n\f       I disagree, however, with the court's conclusions that the appellants have failed\nto prove these constitutional violations.

I agree with the court that the appellants fail to prove they have a\nprotected liberty interest. But, the appellants fully succeed on their procedural due\nprocess claim, as the 2013 Act clearly created a protected tangible property interest\nin public school choice and attendance in Arkansas. The court found that appellants\ndid not have a property interest in public school choice because the property interest\ndefined in Goss v. Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109136\"><a href=\"/opinion/109136/goss-v-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975), was \"the right to participate in the\nentire educational process and not the right to participate in each individual\ncomponent of that process.\" Ante at 19 (quotation omitted). In support, the court\nsays the appellants \"have not been excluded from the educational process\" as they\nwere not prevented from attending public school. Id. (quotation omitted). However,\nthe Legislature of Arkansas statutorily created a much more specific property\ninterest, not just an interest in public school services for the parent and child\nsomewhere in the State of Arkansas. The 2013 Act created for the nonresident\ndistrict applicant a school of the parent and student's \"choice\" in another Arkansas\ndistrict. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 572 (stating that protected interests in property are\ncreated by \"an independent source such as state statutes or rules\"). Unfortunately, the\ncourt attempts to use the statute's exemption clause to improperly slice and dice the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\frelevant property interests created by Goss and the 2013 Act, using inapposite district\ncourt precedent to support its incorrect conclusion.10\n\n       The 2013 Act created justifiable expectations that students could \"attend a\nschool in a nonresident district.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(a) (2013). Although\nthe 2013 Act gave the nonresident school district the discretion to decide whether to\naccept a student seeking transfer, id. § 6-18-1903(d)(1), the terms of the 2013 Act\nillustrate that the legislature envisioned that the capacity of the nonresident school\ndistrict would be the only and exclusive determining factor as to whether the\nnonresident school district accepted a student's transfer application. See id. § 6-18-\n1903(d)(2), (3) (prohibiting a nonresident district from considering an applicant's\nacademic achievements, athletic or other extracurricular ability, English proficiency\nlevel, or disciplinary record in evaluating their application for transfer).11\nAdditionally, the 2013 Act provided that a nonresident district had to state a reason\n\n      10\n        The 2013 Act's broad school choice transfer option as recognized by Teague\nauthorizes the transfer of the \"entire educational process,\" as it is defined by Goss.\nAnte at 19 (quotation omitted). And, the district court opinion cited by the court,\nMazevski v. Horseheads Central School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1971472\"><a href=\"/opinion/1971472/mazevski-v-horseheads-central-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Mazevski deals not with a nonresident,\ninterschool district transfer of the entire educational experience as is contemplated\nby the 2013 Act and appellants. Rather, the limitation imposed in Mazevski involved\na single student being precluded from performing with his school's marching\nband–from which he was dismissed for individual misconduct. The 2013 Act's\nexemption clause was in no way designed to create \"individual component[s]\" of the\nArkansas educational experience–it was a broad administrative procedure improperly\nemployed in this case to wholly abort the appellants' children's entire educational\nprocess in a nonresident district of their parents' choice.\n      11\n         And, in fact, aside from the applicant's personal information–name, age, grade\nlevel, home address, etc.–the only other information the application for transfer under\nthe 2013 Act requested was the name and address of the applicant's resident school\ndistrict and the name and address of the nonresident school district the applicant\nwished to attend.\n\n                                         -32-\n\ffor the rejection if the student's transfer application was not accepted. Id. § 6-18-\n1905(b)(2). Finally, the 2013 Act provided that an applicant whose transfer\napplication was rejected was entitled to a hearing before the state board to reconsider\nthe transfer, as long as she submitted a request for the hearing in writing within ten\ndays after receipt of her rejection. Id. § 6-18-1907(b)(1), (2)(A). Thus, as later\nexplained in more detail, the public school choice transfer right established in the\n2013 Act was more than \"a mere subjective expectancy of school choice,\" ante at 20.\nUnder the 2013 Act, the appellants had a \"legitimate claim of entitlement,\" id. at 18\n(quotation omitted), to \"choose from among different schools with differing assets,\"\nArk. Code Ann. § 6-18-1901(b)(1) (2013), and when the Blytheville District wrongly\nand unconstitutionally exempted itself from the 2013 Act, the Blytheville District\nunlawfully deprived appellants of their protected property interest and hearing rights.\nThe appellants clearly establish that the Blytheville District did not afford them\nadequate and statutorily specified procedural rights designed to protect their\nconstitutionally protected property interests, and thus the Blytheville District violated\nthe appellants' due process rights, see ante at 15, for which violations the appellants\nare entitled to monetary damages.12\n\n      12\n         In a further attempt to void this statutorily established and constitutionally\nprotected school transfer prerogative, the district court and this court seek to\ndisembowel and thus, overrule the thrust of the Supreme Court's holding in Goss. To\ndo so, the district court and this court assert that the 2013 Act created only a \"mere\nsubjective expectancy of school choice.\" Ante at 20. In this effort, this court cites\na series of inapplicable rules, irrelevant dictionary definitions and inapposite case\nlaw. The court accurately states, and then disregards, the fact that the only limiting\nacceptance choice the 2013 Act provides a receiving school district concerning a\ntransferring student's property right is the student \"capacity\" of such receiving school.\nBut, in this dispute, the unlawful Blytheville District exemption claim sought to and\ndid miscarry any attempt by the appellants to test this \"capacity\" question in the\nputative receiving districts. How this de minimis and untested capacity limitation can\nbe allowed to derail the appellants' constitutionally protected property interests,\nwithout a statutorily required hearing of any nature, is not explained or even\naddressed by this court.\n\n                                          -33-\n\f                                           II.\n\n        I also disagree with the court's analysis of appellants' demand for damages\nunder their equal protection claims. Despite the court's finding to the contrary, see\nid. at 26-27, nothing in the record in this case generated \"at least a rational basis for\n[Blytheville District's] believing that the 2013 Act authorized it to take the\n\n\n\n       The court's sole cited precedent for this unsupportable \"subjective expectancy\"\ncontention is an unpublished Fifth Circuit case, Horton v. City of Smithville, 117 F.\nApp'x 345, 347-48 (5th Cir. 2004) (unpublished). Strangely, this case deals not with\na constitutionally protected property interest, but with whether the appellant, Horton,\nhad a property interest in the City of Smithville's lack of enforcement of the city's\nzoning ordinance prohibiting the staging of a live music event on a neighbor's\nproperty. The answer by the court was that he did not. Id. at 348. However, what\nlight the Horton decision sheds upon whether the appellants in this case have an\nactionable constitutionally based property interest granted by the Arkansas statute is\nwholly shaded. And importantly, the Horton case is of dubious force as citable\nprecedent since the Fifth Circuit attaches no precedential value to an unpublished\nopinion, Fifth Circuit Appellate Rule 47.5.4, and neither does this circuit. Eighth\nCircuit Appellate Rule 32.1A.\n\n       It is also worth mentioning that the Arkansas statute explicitly states that a\n\"school district receiving transfers under this [school choice] act shall not\ndiscriminate on the basis of gender, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, or\ndisability.\" Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-1903(d)(3). Thus, it is patently inconsistent with\nthe general racial policies established in the 2013 Act that the Board of Directors of\nthe Blytheville District should now attempt to oppose appellants' school transfer\nefforts with its letter of April 22, 2015, to the Arkansas Department of Education\n(ADE), which letter raises issues of \"desegregation obligations . . . (i.e., the creation,\nmaintaining, or increasing of racially identifiable schools).\" Ante at 13. Such issues\nwere put to rest by Judge Eisele's interdicting dismissal order of December 6, 1978.\nThis is an especially questionable argument by the Blytheville District given the blind\neye presented by its Board of Directors to the 250 student exodus in 2009 mostly\nfrom the Blytheville District to the Kipp Delta Academy School \"the majority of\nwhom [were] African Americans or other minorities.\" Ante at 24.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fexemption.\" Id. at 28. Indeed, the record clearly prevented the Blytheville District\nfrom nullifying appellants' attempted transfers to the nonresident district. No\nreasonable reading of Franklin v. Board of Education of the Blytheville, Arkansas,\nSchool District No. 5, No. J-71-C-35 (E.D. Ark.), allowed the Blytheville District to\nbelieve it was still subject to a desegregation order of any nature.\n\n        Judge Eisele on August 19, 1971, entered an order that approved Blytheville\nDistrict's desegregation plan for its high school, junior high schools, and elementary\nschools. In that same order, the court further approved the Blytheville District's\ndesegregation plan with respect to faculty and administrative staff assignments–with\nfour minor reservations. On June 21, 1973, Judge Eisele, noted that the items\nreserved as mentioned above \"are no longer a subject of controversy\" and closed the\ncase, reserving jurisdiction \"for necessary and appropriate purposes.\" Five years\nlater, on December 6, 1978, Judge Eisele issued an order fully dismissing the Franklin\ncase. Thus, the plain language of these orders leaves no doubt that the Franklin court\nclosed the case and ultimately ceded jurisdiction over the case and the parties.\nTherefore, as earlier noted, the Blytheville District had no rational basis for believing\nit was still subject to a desegregation order, and consequently no means of lawfully\nexempting itself from the 2013 Act.13 The Blytheville District's violation of the 2013\n\n\n      13\n         As the court notes, the Blytheville District also claims that a May 31, 1973,\nletter sent from the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare\n(HEW) is a \"mandate by a federal agency that it cannot return to the dual school\nsystem.\" Ante at 28. The record is clear that this claimed continuing mandate is\nunfounded. The HEW letter stated that the Blytheville District \"must modify its\n[desegregation] plan as may be ordered by the court to remain in compliance.\"\n(Emphasis added.). Less than a month later, Judge Eisele issued his June 21, 1973,\norder finding that the matters mentioned in the HEW letter were \"no longer a subject\nof controversy\" and he then closed the case. The timing of Judge Eisele's June 21,\n1973, order in relation to the May 31, 1973, HEW letter obviously establishes that he\nfelt no further modification of the desegregation plan was necessary for the school\ndistrict to \"remain in compliance.\" Further, once Judge Eisele ceded jurisdiction in\n\n                                          -35-\n\fAct and the subsequent disparate treatment that resulted–allowing intra-district\ntransfers to the Kipp Delta charter school, but denying appellants' inter-district\ntransfers under the 2013 Act–violated appellants' equal protection rights, for which\nappellants are entitled to monetary damages.\n\n       The district court strangely found–apparently responding to Blytheville\nDistrict's wholly frivolous contention that Judge Eisele's order should have contained\nsome \"unitary school system\" language–that even after the passage of at least thirty-\nseven years of Blytheville District's lawful operation as a unitary (non-dual) school\n\n\n\nthe case over the parties through his December 6, 1978, order, the court no longer\nretained any authority to order the school district to modify its desegregation plan.\nThus, HEW's May 31, 1973, letter, on its own, cannot credibly be read as a \"mandate\nof a federal . . . agency remedying the effects of past racial segregation,\" because the\nletter instructs the school district to follow any order \"by the court,\" which later\nclosed the case and ceded jurisdiction over the parties. As a result, since at least 1978\nthere has no longer been an active desegregation plan which the government or a\nprivate party could \"seek modification of,\" and there is also no way for the\nBlytheville District to fall out of compliance with a long since-closed desegregation\norder.\n\n       The district court and this court found credible the Blytheville District's\nargument that the February 11, 1971, HEW letter to the school district and the May\n31, 1973, HEW letter to the ADE continue to stand as \"active mandates\" prohibiting\nchanges that in any manner increase \"racially identifiable schools.\" In this case, the\nBlytheville District's argument obviously means not permitting any \"Caucasian\"\nexodus from the district. This active mandate stands, according to the Blytheville\nDistrict, and now this court, notwithstanding Judge Eisele's interdiction order of\nDecember 6, 1978, and according to the record in this case, the passage of at least\nthirty-seven years of the Blytheville District's operation of a desegregated \"unitary\nnon-racial\" school system and accompanied by no evidence of any activities causing\nsubstantial racial imbalance changes in the district except, perhaps, the Blytheville\nDistrict's authorized movement of the 250 students to Kipp Delta Academy in 2009.\nAnte at 24.\n\n                                          -36-\n\fsystem, the Blytheville District was still subject to a Franklin desegregation order.\nThis was error. The district court's incorrect holding that Judge Eisele, in Franklin,\nshould have made a specific finding that the Blytheville District had achieved unitary\nstatus in order to properly dismiss the August 1971 desegregation action is based on\ninapposite cases and faulty analysis of applicable law. Indeed, at the time the\nFranklin court dismissed the action in 1978, there was no case law requiring a finding\nof unitary status in order to properly close a desegregation order. The two cases the\ndistrict court relies on for the requirement that a finding of unitary status is necessary\nare Jenkins by Jenkins v. State of Missouri, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744825\"><a href=\"/opinion/744825/chinyere-jenkins-by-her-next-friend-joi-jenkins-nicholas-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1997), and Lockett\nv. Board of Education of Muscogee County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1996). Not only\nwere these two cases decided nearly two decades after Franklin, both cases are\nfactually distinguishable from Franklin. In Lockett, the court ordered the school\ndistrict to present and implement a desegregation plan in 1971 and continued to\nmaintain jurisdiction over the case into the 1990s, even though the district court\n\"ignored the school district's actions after 1980.\" Id. at 1097-98. Similarly in\nJenkins, the district court still had jurisdiction over the desegregation action, and\naction in the case was ongoing, into the 1990s. Jenkins by Jenkins, 122 F.3d at 590-\n91. Conversely, in Franklin, the case was dismissed for all purposes and without\nappeal in 1978, long before the case law established, if any binding litigation ever\nhas, any precedent that required district courts to make an express finding of unitary\nstatus. In sum, the unitary status contention frivolously asserted by the Blytheville\nDistrict and wrongly accepted by the district court was simply an unsupportable\nexcuse for improperly urging a non-existent transfer exemption–not a basis for the\ndistrict court's interference with the transfers.\n\n       Contrary to the district court's findings, the Franklin court had done all that was\nrequired to close the case. When the Franklin case was dismissed in 1978, if a school\ndistrict had achieved the objectives of a desegregation order, the district court's\nremedial authority over those objectives was ended and the injunction was dissolved.\nSee Pasadena City Bd. of Educ. v. Spangler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109519\"><a href=\"/opinion/109519/pasadena-city-bd-of-ed-v-spangler/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436-37 (1976). Judge\n\n                                          -37-\n\fEisele's actions in the Franklin case make clear that he believed the Blytheville\nDistrict had achieved the objectives of all desegregation orders. Thus there is no\ncredible evidence that the Blytheville District has been subject to a desegregation\norder related to the Franklin case since December 6, 1978.\n\n       Penultimately, with regard to the Blytheville District's transfer exemption\nclaim, I note that the Board of Directors of the Blytheville District do not and cannot\ndeny that they, and their predecessor Boards, have actually operated a desegregated\nunitary public school system since at least 1978. There also appears to be no\nevidence in this case, or even any claims, that a dual, segregated public school system\nor any vestiges of the same has in any way operated since Judge Eisele's final order\nin 1978. Accordingly, the Blytheville District's exemption claims were, in substance,\nwholly specious.\n\n       Finally, in the alternative, the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment in favor of the Blytheville District. Summary judgment is only proper if\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A district court's\nfinding of unitary status is a finding of fact, reviewed for clear error. Fisher v.\nTucson Unified School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"221262\"><a href=\"/opinion/221262/fisher-v-tucson-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1136 (9th Cir. 2011). In the instant case\nthen, if there is a genuine dispute as to whether there is or is not unitary status, as\nseemingly advanced by the Blytheville District, the granting of summary judgment\nto the Blytheville District was erroneous.\n\n      For the aforementioned reasons, I respectfully dissent on the issue of the\nappellants' damages arising from their procedural due process and equal protection\nclaims and would remand the issues back to the district court to determine monetary\ndamages, costs, and fees.\n                      ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -38-\n\f</pre>",
