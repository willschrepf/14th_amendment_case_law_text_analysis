When the parties divorced in 2008,\nMother was designated primary residential parent of the parties‟ one-year-old son.\nMother later remarried and sought permission to relocate to Australia with the child.\nFollowing a hearing in 2011, the trial court denied Mother‟s request to relocate and\nchanged the designation of primary residential parent to Father. Mother moved to\nAustralia with her new husband. Mother instituted this proceeding in 2013, alleging that\na material change in circumstance has occurred and that it is in the child‟s best interest to\nlive with her in Australia. The trial court considered testimony over the course of four\ndays and eventually dismissed Mother‟s petition.

FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Michael David B. (“Father”) and Kathryne B.F. (“Mother”) were divorced by\ndecree of the Shelby County Circuit Court in July 2008. The parties had one child,\n\fCaleb, who was born in October 2006. The trial court entered a permanent parenting\nplan designating Mother the primary residential parent of one-year-old Caleb. Father was\nto have parenting time with Caleb three days per week but at varying times due to his\natypical work schedule. Father is employed as an assistant manager at Walgreen‟s, and\nin any given week, he works a combination of different shifts between the hours of 7:30\na.m. and 10:30 p.m.\n\n        In January 2011, Father filed a petition opposing Mother‟s removal of the child\nfrom the jurisdiction of the court. According to the petition, Mother was engaged to an\nAustralian and planning to relocate with Caleb to Australia. Father sought an order\ndenying Mother‟s request to relocate in accordance with Tennessee‟s parental relocation\nstatute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108. Mother filed a response and a counter-petition\nseeking the entry of a revised parenting plan that would enable her to relocate to\nAustralia with four-year-old Caleb. Mother married her fiancé on March 6, 2011.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on March 24, 2011, and considered the testimony of\nFather, Mother, Mother‟s new husband, and Caleb‟s paternal grandmother. The court\nissued a letter ruling on May 5, 2011. The court found that since Caleb was born, the\nparties had enjoyed “a nearly ideal co-parenting relationship that included both sets of\ngrandparents and nearly seamless transition from one home to the other.” In fact, the\ncourt found that “the child has been raised by his Mother, his Father, his maternal\ngrandparents and his paternal grandparents.” The court noted the parties‟ agreement that\nCaleb was spending substantially more time with Mother than with Father, within the\nmeaning of the parental relocation statute, but the court observed that “if you segregate\nout the time spent with grandparents, then the parents are more nearly equal.” In any\nevent, the court concluded that moving Caleb to Australia posed a threat of specific and\nserious harm to the child that outweighed the threat of harm from a change of custody.\nSee Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(d)(1)(B). The court noted that Mother was proposing to\nmove Caleb not just to another part of this state or country but rather to “the other side of\nthe globe,” with a significant time zone differential and even opposite seasons. The court\nfound that Mother‟s proposed move would separate Caleb “from all he has known, from\nall of his family and extended family except his Mother by almost half the planet.”\nHaving found a threat of specific and serious harm to the child, the trial court was\nrequired to determine whether to permit relocation based on the best interest of the child.\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(e). The court found that many of the best interest factors\nweighed equally in favor of Mother and Father, while others were inapplicable due to\nCaleb‟s young age. However, the court found that the factor regarding the importance of\ncontinuity in the child‟s life and the length of time he had lived in a stable, satisfactory\nenvironment weighed heavily in Father‟s favor. The court concluded that placing Caleb\nwith Father was advantageous because it “would permit him to continue to be involved\nwith his Father and both sets of grandparents as he is accustomed to being.” “That is to\n                                             2\n\fsay,” the court explained, “[Caleb] will now be supported by [a] three-legged stool,\nwhereas in the past he had a four-legged stool. Were he to move to Australia, his stool\nwould have but one leg.” The court also considered the stability of each parent‟s family\nunit and concluded that this factor also weighed in Father‟s favor because Mother had\nonly recently married her current husband, whom she met on the Internet and dated “face\nto face” only a few weeks prior to their marriage. The court noted the testimony of\nMother‟s husband that he had little experience with children and was not a “child guy.”\nConsidering all of these factors, the trial court concluded that relocating to Australia was\nnot in Caleb‟s best interest. Accordingly, the court denied Mother‟s request to relocate\nCaleb to Australia and designated Father as primary residential parent. The court entered\na written order granting Father‟s petition in opposition to removal on June 8, 2011, nunc\npro tunc to the date of the letter ruling, May 5, 2011. The trial court directed the parties\nto either tender a modified parenting plan reached by consent or submit proposed plans\nfor the court to consider. However, due to disputes regarding various issues, the parties\ndid not reach an agreement regarding a permanent parenting plan for several months.\n\n       In the meantime, Mother moved to Australia on June 3, 2011. Caleb spent\napproximately six weeks with Mother in Australia during June and July 2011.\nThereafter, Mother returned to the United States with Caleb and stayed for about eight\nweeks to aid in his transition. She returned to Australia in September 2011. After\nMother‟s return to Australia, Caleb‟s paternal grandmother emailed to Mother a summary\nof “the schedule we follow for Caleb‟s care.” The email stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Carol [maternal grandmother] picks Caleb up from Michelle [paternal\n       grandmother] Tuesdays at 9:30 am. - Caleb is there overnight Tues., Wed.\n\n       Michelle picks Caleb up from Carol Thursdays at 9:30 am. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Thurs., Fri.\n\n       Carol picks Caleb up from Michelle Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Sat.\n\n       Michelle picks Caleb up from Carol Sundays at 1:30 p.m. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Sun., Mon.\n\n       [Father] gets Caleb from whichever grandmother has him when he is off;\n       and delivers him back to whichever grandmother is scheduled to keep him\n       when he has to go back to work. For instance, I didn‟t keep Caleb\n       yesterday (Thursday) because [Father] was off. He brought him to me\n       today (Friday) at noon before he left for a 1:30-11:00 p.m. work shift at\n       Walgreens.\n                                             3\n\fMother thanked the paternal grandmother for the information about Caleb‟s schedule\nwithout objection. Caleb had another extended visit in Australia for approximately six\nweeks during December 2011 and January 2012.\n\n        A modified permanent parenting plan was finally entered on March 1, 2012. The\nparenting plan provided that Mother would have “several long-term periods of parenting\ntime with the child each calendar year in Australia” and “additional parenting time with\nthe child here in Shelby County, Tennessee, with the dates to be determined by the\nparties by agreement[.]” Caleb would primarily reside with Mother during the periods\nwhen she returned to the United States, but not to exceed six weeks annually. During\nsuch periods, “the Father[] and his family” would have weekly parenting time. Mother\nwas not required to pay child support to Father, but she was fully responsible for Caleb‟s\ntransportation costs for his visits to Australia. The parenting plan stated that Father\nagreed to provide extra time to Mother in the upcoming year since Caleb was not yet\nenrolled in “formal” school. It also provided that Caleb‟s maternal grandparents were\nentitled to visitation with him during the first and third weekends of each month from\nSaturday at 6 p.m. until Sunday at 1:30 p.m., pursuant to Tennessee‟s grandparent\nvisitation statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306. Father was required to “provide for the\nchild‟s care with either set of grandparents as the primary option.” He was also required\nto notify Mother if he planned to be “absent from the child” for more than three\nconsecutive days.\n\n        Caleb spent two months in Australia during the summer of 2012. Upon returning\nto Memphis, he began kindergarten in August 2012. The week before school began,\nFather emailed Mother regarding his plans for Caleb during the upcoming school year.\nFather informed Mother that he planned for Caleb to spend every school night at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house in order to “keep him stable and grounded in a routine as\nmuch as possible” and avoid “bounc[ing] him between three beds during his\nschoolweek.” Father informed Mother that the maternal grandparents would have time\nwith Caleb “most weekends” from Saturday at 5 p.m. to Sunday at 1:30 p.m. He would\nalso allow Caleb to spend Wednesday afternoons with the maternal grandparents from the\ntime he was released from school until they finished attending church service on\nWednesday evenings so that Caleb could participate in the church choir. Mother\nresponded by thanking Father for the information and stating, “I think it‟s a good idea for\nhim to have the consistency of one bed during the school week while also keeping his\nconnection with my family and the continuation of his longstanding church activities.”\n\n      Mother returned to the United States for two weeks in October 2012 around\nCaleb‟s sixth birthday. During such visits, Mother and Caleb would typically stay at the\nmaternal grandparents‟ house, and Caleb would visit with Father and the paternal\n                                            4\n\fgrandparents from Friday night until Sunday afternoon.\n\n       On January 31, 2013, Mother initiated the instant proceeding by filing a petition to\nmodify the March 1, 2012 parenting plan. By that time, Caleb was mid-way through\nkindergarten. Mother alleged that even though Father was designated as Caleb‟s primary\nresidential parent, Caleb was primarily residing with his paternal grandparents, and they\nwere actually raising him rather than Father. Mother acknowledged that “it was\ncontemplated that the child would enjoy time with both sets of grandparents,” but she\nclaimed that “it certainly was not contemplated by Mother or the Court that the Father\nwould defer his parenting responsibilities to the paternal grandmother and that she would\nbe the primary caregiver of the minor child.” Mother therefore claimed that a material\nchange in circumstance existed and that it was in Caleb‟s best interest to reside with her\nin Australia. Mother submitted a proposed permanent parenting plan that designated her\nas primary residential parent and provided Father with “several long-term periods of\nparenting time” each year in the United States and in Australia. Pursuant to Mother‟s\nproposed parenting plan, Caleb would travel to the United States four times per year\nduring breaks from his school in Australia. The plan provided that Caleb would get to\nspend the night with his grandparents at least one night per week when he was visiting\nthe United States. Father filed a response denying that Caleb was residing with the\npaternal grandparents and denying that Mother was entitled to relief.\n\n       The trial court heard testimony over the course of four days between April and\nJune 2013. Caleb was six and a half years old. Mother had been residing in Canberra,\nAustralia, for about two years.1 She and her husband resided in a two-bedroom\napartment. Mother worked at a university from around 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through\nFriday. Because Mother worked five days per week and arrived home as late as 5:30, she\nacknowledged the possibility that she would enroll Caleb in an after-school program or\nsummer camp if he moved to Australia. Mother testified that Caleb spent a total of about\nfive months visiting her in Australia over the course of the past two years and that he had\nmade friends there. Mother testified that Caleb had also developed a warm relationship\nwith her current husband, Shannon, who had taught Caleb to swim, snow ski, and boogie\nboard.\n\n       Mother testified that when Caleb is in the United States, she communicates with\nhim nearly every day via Skype video chat. She testified that their average Skype\nsessions last about thirty minutes and occur after Caleb gets home from school in the\nafternoon, which equates to early morning in Australia before Mother leaves for work.\nShe testified that when Caleb is visiting Australia, he also communicates with Father via\nSkype several times a week depending on his work schedule. Mother suggested that\n\n1\n    Mother testified that Canberra is the capital of Australia and a city of about 370,000 residents.\n                                                         5\n\fFather and Caleb‟s grandparents could maintain active involvement in Caleb‟s life even if\nhe moved to Australia by using Skype and sending letters and care packages. During\ncross-examination, however, Mother identified several unopened letters that were\naddressed to Caleb in Australia and mailed by his paternal grandmother. Mother testified\nthat she gave the letters to Caleb, and he did not choose to open them, so she placed them\nin his backpack when he returned to the United States.\n\n       Mother testified that she filed the petition to modify because she did not believe\nthat Father was fulfilling his obligations as primary residential parent. She testified that,\nbased on her observation, Father was not spending any more time with Caleb than he did\nwhen Father was designated the alternate residential parent prior to Mother‟s move to\nAustralia. She noted that Caleb had been spending every school night at the home of the\npaternal grandparents and also spending time with her parents most weekends. Mother\nclaimed that when she stated in her email that Father‟s plan for school nights was “a good\nidea,” she simply agreed that Caleb needed consistency during the school week, and she\nwas not advocating for him to stay with the grandparents. Mother admitted that Father\nwas a good father but claimed that he failed to make Caleb the priority in his life.\n\n       Mother testified that if Caleb was permitted to move to Australia, he would attend\na nearby school and have four breaks from school annually – three two-week breaks\nthroughout the year and a six-week break around Christmas. Mother proposed that Caleb\nspend each of the two-week breaks and half of his Christmas break in the United States.\nShe testified that Father and Caleb‟s grandparents would be welcome to visit him in\nAustralia as well. Mother conceded that traveling between the United States and\nAustralia is “not easy,” but she insisted that it was realistic to expect the grandparents to\nmake the trip. She acknowledged, though, that her parents had never visited her in\nAustralia. She testified that the cost of flights from Canberra “all the way to Memphis”\nor vice versa was between $1,500 and $1,800. She mentioned the fact that she had spent\n“thousands of dollars” on plane tickets for herself and for Caleb. If Caleb were permitted\nto relocate, Mother proposed that Father be responsible for all of Caleb‟s transportation\ncosts in lieu of paying child support.\n\n        Mother claimed that she had been “consistently the most important person” in\nCaleb‟s life. She did not foresee any harm to Caleb by moving him to Australia. She\ndescribed Caleb as resilient and noted that he was an excellent student. However, she\nacknowledged that some stress indicators were “showing up in his life.” For example, he\nrecently had problems with urinary urgency, which a pediatric urologist diagnosed as\nstress-related.\n\n       Mother‟s husband, Shannon, testified via Skype from Australia. He also worked\nat a university in Australia. He generally worked weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,\n                                             6\n\fwith some flexibility. He described his relationship with Caleb as “excellent.” Shannon\ntestified that his previous statement about not being a “child guy” was taken out of\ncontext, and that he simply meant that he lacked experience with children. He said he\nwas really enjoying “doing the parenting role” with Caleb. Shannon‟s mother and father\nalso resided in Australia, but the drive to his mother‟s house was fourteen hours and the\ndrive to his father‟s house was seven hours. Caleb had visited them once or twice. Like\nMother, Shannon believed that Caleb‟s relationships with Father and his grandparents\nwere “not as important or essential to Caleb‟s wellbeing as being with his mother.”\nShannon suggested that he and Mother would also benefit financially if Caleb were\npermitted to move to Australia because they were currently “spending so much money”\non travel expenses. In other words, he believed that the cost of raising Caleb full-time\nwould be less than the amount he was currently spending on travel expenses.\n\n        Mother‟s parents, Caleb‟s maternal grandparents, also testified. At the time of\ntrial, Caleb was spending time at their home on Wednesday evenings and “usually”\novernight on Saturdays. The maternal grandfather testified that before Caleb started\nschool, he spent about three nights per week at their home, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,\nand Saturdays. Prior to that schedule, when Mother still lived in the United States, she\nand Caleb resided with the maternal grandparents for “a number of months” and then\nmoved into a house “two doors down” from the maternal grandparents. Caleb‟s\ngrandfather acknowledged that Caleb is well adjusted in Memphis and doing well, but he\nbelieved that Caleb was most closely bonded to Mother and that he should reside in\nAustralia with her. He testified that he and his wife had not visited Australia to date\nbecause they were not financially able to do so. He explained that even though they\ncould stay with Mother and avoid a lodging expense, the cost of flights was simply too\nexpensive.\n\n       Mother‟s mother testified that all of Caleb‟s grandparents had always been very\ninvolved in his life. When Mother was living near the maternal grandparents and\nemployed, the maternal grandmother served as Caleb‟s primary babysitter. She testified\nthat when Mother moved to Australia, Mother told her that she intended to build a life\nand network of support in Australia and then come back to the United States and seek to\nregain custody of Caleb. The maternal grandmother testified that when Mother moved to\nAustralia, she discussed childcare plans with Father and Caleb‟s paternal grandmother\nand, with a “collaborative effort,” they worked out a schedule where each set of\ngrandparents would care for Caleb on certain days of the week. “If it worked out so that\n[Father] had time off in his schedule where he could have Caleb overnight,” the maternal\ngrandmother would defer to Father. However, the maternal grandmother estimated that\nshe only deferred to Father for overnight stays occasionally, “[m]aybe a couple of times a\nmonth.” Otherwise, before Caleb started kindergarten, she had him overnight on\nTuesdays, when he attended a church Mother‟s Day Out program, Wednesdays, when he\n                                            7\n\fhad choir practice, and Saturdays, when he had church the next day. Once Caleb started\nkindergarten, she began keeping him Wednesday afternoons until Father picked him up\nfrom church, in addition to Saturday nights until Sunday after church. The maternal\ngrandmother admitted that Caleb loves both his parents. She said that Caleb “doesn‟t\nlack for physical needs” in Memphis and acknowledged that he is enrolled in a very good\nschool. However, she believed that Father did not have the same emotional connection\nwith Caleb that Mother had. The maternal grandmother confirmed that she and her\nhusband had not visited Australia for financial reasons.\n\n      Mother‟s younger sister testified that she traveled with Caleb to Australia in the\nsummer of 2012 and cared for him while Mother and Shannon were at work. She resided\nin Memphis but also believed that Caleb should reside with Mother in Australia so that\nMother could provide consistency for Caleb.\n\n       Mother had hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance of Father and the\npaternal grandmother over the course of eight days. During that time, however, the\ninvestigator saw Caleb only three to four times. One of those times, he saw Caleb with\nFather; the other times he was with the paternal grandmother. The investigator also\nconfirmed the fact that Father was working at Walgreen‟s.\n\n      At the conclusion of Mother‟s proof, Father moved to dismiss based on the lack of\nproof of a material change in circumstances. The trial court declined to rule on the\nmotion until it heard Father‟s proof.\n\n        As noted above, Father was employed as an assistant manager at Walgreen‟s. He\ntestified that he had been employed at Walgreen‟s for nearly ten years. He testified that\nhe generally works five days a week, and he had already been transferred, by request, to a\nlocation with the minimum number of work hours required for his position. He said he\nbasically runs the store location where he is assigned, making personnel decisions and\nschedules, ordering inventory, and “the whole gamut.” He testified that his work\nschedule varies from week to week and depends on the schedules of other lower\nmanagers, warehouse shipments, and other factors. Generally, Father works either an\nopening shift from roughly 7:30 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m.; a mid-day shift such as 9 a.m. to 5\np.m.; or a closing shift from about 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. His commute to or from work\nalso takes about twenty minutes. He said he typically works the closing shift once a\nweek but sometimes twice a week. Father said he tries to schedule his closing shifts for\nSaturdays when Caleb is staying with the maternal grandparents. About once every three\nweeks, Father must arrive at the store around 5:30 a.m. to receive a warehouse shipment.\n\n      Father acknowledged the role that both sets of grandparents play in Caleb‟s life.\nHe noted that Caleb and Mother lived with the maternal grandparents for about a year\n                                            8\n\fafter the parties‟ separation, and even after Mother moved out, she still lived two doors\ndown. He described Caleb‟s maternal grandmother as “one of the bedrocks” in Caleb‟s\nlife. Father said that his own mother had recently retired from her job as a school teacher\nand “made it her primary mission to help with the raising and nurturing of Caleb.” He\nsaid that both grandmothers used a curriculum to teach and instruct Caleb before he\nentered kindergarten that greatly benefitted his intellectual development.\n\n       Father testified that, after Mother moved to Australia, he set out specific days of\nthe week when each set of grandparents would have Caleb if Father was working, so that\nthe grandparents would not be at the mercy of his changing schedule each week. For\nexample, on Tuesdays, the schedule “defaulted” to the maternal grandparents unless\nFather was off work. Father testified that aside from his work hours, he was with Caleb.\nHe said, “whichever days I was off, I would have him for the entirety of that day,” and in\naddition, “[i]f it was a day that I was working, if he was at my mother‟s house I would be\nover there as soon as I finished work.”\n\n         When the time came for Caleb to begin kindergarten, Father said he became\nuncomfortable with Caleb “getting tossed around a little more than I wanted him to be.”\nFather wanted Caleb to have the stability of sleeping in one bed during the school week.\nHowever, Father explained that when he was scheduled for a closing shift on a\nweeknight, he would not get home until after 10 p.m., and he did not want to wake Caleb\nat that hour and take him home. As a result, Father decided to have Caleb sleep at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house on weeknights. He said this decision gave Caleb structure\nand a routine but did not change anything in terms of his interaction with Father. Father\nexplained that he was still with Caleb for “the waking hours.” Father said this\narrangement was easier on all parties except himself, as it required him to go to his\nparents‟ house six to seven days a week, much more often than he normally would have.\nFather said “our typical week involves me living out of their house half the time, is what\nit -- is what it feels like.” However, according to Father, the arrangement benefitted the\npaternal grandparents and Caleb. Father said that Caleb already had his own room at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house, which was “part of what he called home.”\n\n        Father testified that Caleb wakes around 6:15 a.m. and goes to bed at night at 7:30\np.m. Father lives in a condominium “maybe a mile” from the paternal grandparents‟\nhome, so it takes him about two minutes to get there. Father said that when he is not at\nwork, he wakes Caleb up “[p]retty much” every single morning and takes him to school\nat 7:30 a.m. He estimated that he takes Caleb to school about three times a week. When\nFather must work the opening shift, the paternal grandmother takes Caleb to school.\nWhen Caleb gets out of school at 2:10 p.m., Father picks him up if he is not working. If\nFather is working, the paternal grandmother or grandfather will pick him up. Father\ntestified that many days when he works the late shift and will not be able to see Caleb\n                                            9\n\fafter school, he has lunch with Caleb at his school or participates in the parent reading\nprogram and the parent watch dog program. He said he visited Caleb‟s school over thirty\ntimes during his kindergarten school year and had lunch with him about once a week.\nAccording to Father, Caleb‟s teachers said that he was the most involved father with the\nclass. He attended field trips, plays, holiday programs, and other events. Father testified\nthat he also attends all of Caleb‟s doctor visits. Caleb did exceptionally well in\nkindergarten and tested into the school‟s CLUE program for gifted students. At the end\nof the school year, Caleb took a literacy test that indicated he was reading beyond a sixth-\ngrade level.\n\n       Father testified that Caleb generally has a Skype session with Mother immediately\nafter school, then he and Caleb have a few hours to play games or work on school\nprojects. Caleb also takes violin lessons. After dinner, Father gives Caleb a bath,\nbrushes his teeth, puts in him bed, and says his prayers with him. Father testified that he\nsometimes falls asleep with Caleb. However, he generally leaves about an hour after\nCaleb falls asleep. This is Caleb‟s routine from Sunday to Thursday nights; unless Father\nis working, he stays at the paternal grandparents‟ house every night until an hour or so\nafter Caleb falls asleep. On Friday nights, Father and Caleb regularly go to dinner and a\nlocal skating rink with some of Caleb‟s friends and classmates, then Caleb stays\novernight at Father‟s condo. On Saturdays, Father and Caleb generally go for outings\neither by themselves or with the paternal grandparents.\n\n        Even though the permanent parenting plan provided for Saturday night visitation\nwith the maternal grandparents only on alternating weekends, Father said he generally let\nCaleb stay with the maternal grandparents about three out of four Saturday nights. Father\ntestified that Caleb‟s maternal grandparents wanted Caleb to attend church services with\nthem on Wednesday nights, so he also agreed for them to pick Caleb up from school on\nWednesdays. Father then picks Caleb up from church, takes him to the paternal\ngrandparents‟ house, and puts him to bed. Father noted that it‟s just “the two of us” for\nthe routine on Wednesday nights because the paternal grandmother also has church choir\npractice. Father claimed that he and Caleb are alone together “a lot of times” during the\nweek, as they sometimes go to his condo after school.\n\n       Overall, Father claimed that he, his parents, and Mother‟s parents work together\n“as a team” like “a well-oiled machine.” Father identified his email to Mother prior to\nhis implementation of the modified kindergarten schedule. He said after Mother wrote\nback stating that she thought it was “a good idea,” he never heard any complaint from\nMother about the schedule until he was served with the petition to modify months later.\nFather said he experimented with having Caleb stay at his home for the last few weeks of\nthe school year and said “[i]t is possible.” However, he said that the arrangement\nrequired someone to stay at his house late until he gets home from working the closing\n                                            10\n\fshift, so it was harder on his “support team.”\n\n       Father disagreed with Mother‟s suggestion that she was the most important person\nin Caleb‟s life. He acknowledged that Mother talks with Caleb thirty minutes a day via\nSkype but said that he is the one taking Caleb to do activities, bandaging skinned knees,\ngiving him baths, and putting him to bed at night. He found nothing “remotely true”\nabout her assertion that she was Caleb‟s emotional bedrock. Father testified that Caleb\nexperienced anxiety issues just prior to Mother‟s last visit to the United States, having a\nurinary urgency issue at school and at home. He said a specialist determined it was\nanxiety-related and prescribed medication, but the problem ended two to three days after\nMother returned to Australia.\n\n       Father was of the opinion that Mother‟s proposed parenting plan had many\nshortcomings. He explained that once travel time is considered, he would only have 55\ndays of parenting time with Caleb each year. He claimed that, to accomplish her plan, 16\ndays per year would be spent “in the air carting back and forth” between the United\nStates and Australia. Father also pointed out the travel costs that would be associated\nwith Mother‟s plan. Using Mother‟s estimation of $1,500 to $1,800 per ticket, and her\nproposal of four trips per year, Father calculated that he would incur between $18,000\nand $22,000 in flight expenses annually because of the fact that someone must\naccompany Caleb on the flights.2 Considering that Father would only get to see Caleb\nabout 55 days, Father testified that he would be required to pay roughly $400 a day to see\nCaleb.\n\n        On July 30, 2013, the trial court entered an order dismissing Mother‟s petition to\nmodify the parenting plan, finding there had been no material change in circumstance\nsince the previous hearing when the court found that Caleb had been raised by his parents\nand both sets of grandparents. The trial court denied Father‟s request for an award of\nattorney‟s fees. Mother timely filed a notice of appeal. On appeal to this Court, we\nconcluded that the trial court failed to make findings to specify the facts upon which the\ncourt based its determination that there had been no material change in circumstance and\nalso failed to specify the basis for its denial of Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees.\nKathryne B.F. v. Michael B., No. W2013-01757-COA-R3-CV, 2014 WL 992110, at *1\n(Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 13, 2014). Because we were unable to conduct a meaningful\nreview of the trial court‟s decision, we vacated the order and remanded for the trial court\nto make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. Id. On August 26, 2014, the\ntrial court entered a detailed order spanning 26 pages and setting forth the basis for its\ndecision on the parenting issues. Mother filed a second notice of appeal.\n2\n Father testified that Mother wanted Caleb to fly alone, but Father insisted that he be accompanied. As a\nresult, the March 2012 permanent parenting plan required that Caleb be accompanied by a companion on\nflights.\n                                                     11\n\f                                             II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        Mother presents the following issues for review on appeal:\n\n        1.       Whether the trial court erred in granting Father‟s motion to dismiss\n                 the petition to modify the parenting plan;\n\n        2.       Whether the trial court erred in not modifying the permanent\n                 parenting plan; and\n\n        3.       Whether Mother should be awarded attorney‟s fees on appeal.\n\nIn his posture as appellee, Father presents the following additional issues:\n\n        4.       Whether the trial court erred in denying Father‟s request for\n                 attorney‟s fees at trial; and\n\n        5.       Whether Father should be awarded attorney‟s fees on appeal.\n\nFor the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                      III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       “In a non-jury case such as this one, appellate courts review the trial court‟s\nfactual findings de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of the\ncorrectness of the findings, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.” Kelly\nv. Kelly, 445 S.W.3d 685, 691-92 (Tenn. 2014) (citing Tenn. R. App. P. 13(d);\nArmbrister v. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d 685, 692 (Tenn. 2013)). We review a trial court‟s\ndeterminations on issues of law de novo without any presumption of correctness.3\nLovlace v. Copley, 418 S.W.3d 1, 16 (Tenn. 2013).\n\n3\n In this case, Father moved for involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41.02 at the close of Mother‟s\nproof. However, the trial court held its ruling in abeyance in order to consider Father‟s proof prior to\nruling on the motion. A Rule 41.02(2) motion for involuntary dismissal challenges the sufficiency of the\nplaintiff‟s proof and requires the trial judge to “impartially weigh and evaluate the plaintiff‟s evidence\njust as it would after all the parties had concluded their cases” and determine “if the plaintiff has failed to\nmake out a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence.” Burton v. Warren Farmers Co-op., 129\nS.W.3d 513, 520-21 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). On appeal, this Court uses the familiar standard of Tennessee\nRule of Appellate Procedure 13(d) to review the trial court‟s disposition of the motion “because the trial\ncourt has used the same reasoning to dispose of the motion that it would have used to make a final\ndecision at the close of all the evidence.” Id. In this case, of course, the trial court did wait to make a\nfinal decision at the close of all the evidence. In any event, Rule 13(d) is clearly applicable.\n                                                      12\n\f        Appellate courts afford trial courts “considerable deference” when reviewing\nissues that hinge on witness credibility because trial courts are able “to observe the\ndemeanor and conduct of witnesses.” Kelly, 445 S.W.3d at 692. “Because decisions\nregarding parenting arrangements are factually driven and require careful consideration\nof numerous factors, trial judges, who have the opportunity to observe the witnesses and\nmake credibility determinations, are better positioned to evaluate the facts than appellate\njudges.” Id. (citing Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 693). “[C]ustody and visitation\ndeterminations often hinge on subtle factors, including the parents‟ demeanor and\ncredibility during . . . proceedings,” and we are reluctant to second-guess those decisions\non appeal. Rountree v. Rountree, 369 S.W.3d 122, 129 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2012). As a\nresult, “trial courts have broad discretion in determining which parent should be the\nprimary residential parent[.]” In re Shayla H., No. M2013-00567-COA-R3-JV, 2014 WL\n2601564, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Jun. 9, 2014) (no perm. app. filed) (citing Reinagel v.\nReinagel, 2010 WL 2867129, at *4 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 21, 2010); Scofield v. Scofield,\n2007 WL 624351, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 28, 2007)). Thus, “the ultimate question as\nto who should be the primary residential parent on appeal is whether the trial court\nabused its discretion in its selection.” Maupin v. Maupin, 420 S.W.3d 761, 770 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 2013) (citing K.B.J. v. T.J., 359 S.W.3d 608, 613, 616-17 (Tenn. Ct. App.\n2011)). “A trial court abuses its discretion in establishing a residential parenting schedule\n„only when the trial court‟s ruling falls outside the spectrum of rulings that might\nreasonably result from an application of the correct legal standards to the evidence found\nin the record.‟” Kelly, 445 S.W.3d at 692 (quoting Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 693). If\n“reasonable minds can disagree as to [the] propriety of the decision made,” the trial\ncourt‟s ruling will be upheld. Eldridge v. Eldridge, 42 S.W.3d 82, 85 (Tenn. 2001).\n\n                                      IV. DISCUSSION\n\n                              A. Mother’s Petition for Modification\n\n        A custody decision is considered res judicata as to the facts in existence when the\ndecision was made. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 698-99. “Res judicata is a rule of rest,\nwhich promotes finality, prevents inconsistent or contradictory judgments, conserves\njudicial resources, and protects litigants from the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits.”\nId. at 698 n.15 (internal quotations omitted). Simply put,\n\n       if either party, as often as he chose, could relitigate the question of custody\n       or support upon the same evidence and the same facts, great would be the\n       inconvenience to the litigants, the courts, and the public; and any trial of the\n       issues would be but an idle ceremony, since it would settle nothing.\n\n                                             13\n\fId. at 699 (quoting Hicks v. Hicks, 176 S.W.2d 371, 375 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1943)). In order\nto balance the interests in finality and stability against the practical reality that changes\nmay occur after the initial custody decree which necessitate modification, courts have\nrequired a party seeking to modify a custody decision to first prove that a material change\nin circumstance has occurred since the prior decree. Id. (citing Ellis v. Carucci, 123 Nev.\n145, 161 P.3d 239, 243 (2007) (recognizing that the concept of material change in\ncircumstances derived from the doctrine of res judicata and was intended to prevent\nlitigants dissatisfied with custody decrees from filing immediate, repetitive, serial\nmotions in the hope of achieving a different result, based on essentially the same facts)).\nTennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-101(a)(2)(B) provides: 4\n\n        If the issue before the court is a modification of the court‟s prior decree\n        pertaining to custody, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the\n        evidence a material change in circumstance. A material change of\n        circumstance does not require a showing of a substantial risk of harm to the\n        child. A material change of circumstance may include, but is not limited to,\n        failures to adhere to the parenting plan or an order of custody and visitation\n        or circumstances that make the parenting plan no longer in the best interest\n        of the child.\n\n       In sum, when assessing a petition to modify a permanent parenting plan, the court\nmust first determine if a material change in circumstance has occurred and then engage in\na best interest analysis. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d 685, 697-98. “When presented with a\nrequest to modify a parenting arrangement, the existing arrangement is generally favored,\nbased on the premise that children tend to thrive in a stable environment.” Wall v. Wall,\nNo. W2010-01069-COA-R3CV, 2011 WL 2732269, at *21 (Tenn. Ct. App. July 14,\n2011) (citing Aaby v. Strange, 924 S.W.2d 623, 627-28 (Tenn. 1996); Hoalcraft v.\nSmithson, 19 S.W.3d 822, 828 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)). Accordingly, “there is „a strong\npresumption in favor of continuity of placement‟ of a child.” Id. (quoting Aaby, 924\nS.W.2d at 627). “A trial court‟s determinations of whether a material change in\ncircumstances has occurred and whether modification of a parenting plan serves a child‟s\nbest interests are factual questions.” Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 692-93 (citing In re\nT.C.D., 261 S.W.3d 734, 742 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2007)). Appellate courts must presume\nthat a trial court‟s factual findings on these matters are correct and not overturn them\nunless the evidence preponderates against the findings. Id. at 693.\n\n                                  1. Material Change in Circumstance\n\n4\n A different standard applies when a litigant seeks modification of a residential parenting schedule but not\nthe designation of primary residential parent. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(2)(C). It is “easier to\nestablish that a material change in circumstances has occurred” when a party seeks to modify only the\nresidential parenting schedule. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 703.\n                                                     14\n\f       Mother did not appeal from the trial court‟s order and March 1, 2012 permanent\nparenting plan initially naming Father as the child‟s primary residential parent and\ndenying Mother permission to relocate to Australia with the child. Accordingly, as\ndiscussed above, that order and parenting plan became res judicata on the subject of\ncustody and could only be modified on a showing of a material change in circumstance.5\nThe March 1, 2012 parenting plan provided that there would be “no regular day-to-day\nschedule as in the typical Parenting Plan Orders entered in this Court,” but generally,\nMother would be entitled to several long-term periods of parenting time with the child in\nAustralia and additional parenting time in Shelby County. The plan provided that when\nMother was visiting the United States, Caleb would have certain parenting time with\nFather “and his family” and “be made available to the [Father‟s] family.” Caleb was also\nscheduled to have overnight visits with the maternal grandparents two Saturday nights\nper month. Father was required to “provide for the child‟s care with either set of\ngrandparents as the primary option” and to notify Mother if he planned “to be absent\nfrom the child for more than three consecutive days.” Solely for “legal purposes,” the\nplan specified that Caleb was “scheduled to reside the majority of the time with [Father].”\nSix months before this parenting plan was entered, however, Mother received the email\nfrom the paternal grandmother containing the schedule they followed for Caleb‟s care\nafter she moved to Australia, whereby Caleb was scheduled to stay with either set of\ngrandparents on specified nights unless Father was off work.6\n5\n Both parties analyze this case as an ordinary petition to modify, requiring the demonstration of a material\nchange in circumstance and a best interest analysis. Even though changing custody would require Caleb\nto relocate to Australia, we agree with the parties‟ implicit conclusion, and that of the trial court, that the\nparental relocation statute is inapplicable to this particular proceeding. The parental relocation statute\nspeaks in terms of the relocation of a parent. See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(a) (“If a parent who\nis spending intervals of time with a child desires to relocate outside the state or more than fifty (50) miles\nfrom the other parent within the state, the relocating parent shall . . . .”). Because neither parent is\nproposing to relocate, the parental relocation statute does not apply.\n6\n As noted above, the trial court‟s June 8, 2011 written order denied Mother permission to relocate and\ndesignated Father as primary residential parent “subject to a Modified Permanent Parenting Plan.” The\ntrial judge directed the parties to either tender to the court a permanent parenting plan devised by consent\nor proposed parenting plans for consideration. After disputing various issues, the parties finally reached\nan agreement as to a permanent parenting plan, which was entered March 1, 2012. During the interim,\nthe parties operated under a June 21, 2011 “Order Regarding International Travel,” which allowed Mother\nto take Caleb to Australia for six weeks during the summer of 2011 but also directed the parties to\n“continue to consult with one another via the internet during this summer vacation to complete a Revised\nParenting Plan Order.” When determining whether a material change in circumstance has occurred, we\nmeasure from the prior final order of custody under which the parties are operating. Broadrick v.\nBroadrick, No. M2013-02628-COA-R3-CV, 2015 WL 1947186, at *5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Apr. 29, 2015) (no\nperm. app. filed); In re Teven A., No. M2013-02519-COA-R3-JV, 2014 WL 7419292, at *4 (Tenn. Ct.\nApp. Dec. 29, 2014) (no perm. app. filed); In re M.J.H., 196 S.W.3d 731, 742 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005); see\nalso Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-404(a) (providing that “[a]ny final decree or decree of modification in an\n                                                        15\n\f       The parties agree that in August 2012, Caleb started kindergarten and began\nspending the night at his paternal grandparents‟ house on school nights, meaning, five\nnights per week. He also spent three out of four Saturday nights with his maternal\ngrandparents, and time on Wednesday evenings, as opposed to only the two Saturday\nnight visits per month provided in the parenting plan. We agree with Mother‟s\ncontention that this constitutes a material change in circumstance since the entry of the\nprevious parenting plan. “There are no bright-line rules for determining whether the\nrequisite change in circumstances has occurred.” Keisling v. Keisling, 196 S.W.3d 703,\n718 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005). “[R]elevant considerations include whether the change (1)\nhas occurred after the entry of the last order sought to be modified; (2) could not be\nreasonably anticipated at the time the last order was entered; and (3) is one that affects\nthe child in a meaningful way.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       The trial court found that Mother failed to prove a material change in circumstance\n“that was not in existence or reasonably foreseeable” at the time of the March 1, 2012\nparenting plan. The court found that Caleb misses his Mother since she has moved to\nAustralia and that Mother has established a nice home there, but “[f]or these items, there\nwere no changes from the situation that existed at the 2011 trial or reasonably anticipated\nonce Mother moved to Australia.” The trial court also referenced the requirement in the\nparenting plan that Father use the grandparents as his first option for child care and found\nthat Father was complying with the parenting plan. Even so, however, we respectfully\ndisagree with the trial court‟s conclusion that a material change in circumstance has not\noccurred since the entry of the previous parenting plan. Even though the March 1, 2012\nparenting plan contemplated that Caleb would spend a substantial amount of time with\nboth sets of grandparents, the changes that actually occurred once Caleb began\nkindergarten were significant, material, and unanticipated, and they affected Caleb‟s\nwell-being in a meaningful way.\n\n                                             2. Best Interest\n\n       Our conclusion that a material change in circumstance has occurred answers only\nthe threshold question in this modification proceeding. “It does not predetermine the\noutcome of the case.” Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 705. Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 36-6-106(a) provides that in any proceeding requiring the court to make a custody\ndetermination regarding a minor child, “the determination shall be made on the basis of\nthe best interest of the child.” The statute directs the courts to “order a custody\narrangement that permits both parents to enjoy the maximum participation possible in the\n\naction for absolute divorce . . . involving a minor child shall incorporate a permanent parenting plan[.]”)\nThus, we deem the June 8, 2011 order as non-final and measure from the date of the March 1, 2012\npermanent parenting plan.\n                                                     16\n\flife of the child consistent with the factors set out in this subsection (a), the location of\nthe residences of the parents, the child‟s need for stability and all other relevant factors.”\nId. After the trial court stated its finding that no material change in circumstance had\noccurred, the court recognized that it was unnecessary to address the best interest factors.\nHowever, the court went on discuss the best interest factors and state that if the court was\nrequired to reweigh the factors, it would find that “they weigh in favor of Father”\nremaining the primary residential parent. In addition, the trial court made numerous\nfactual findings earlier in its 26-page opinion that are relevant to the best interest factors,\nwhich are set forth below:7\n\n            (1) The strength, nature, and stability of the child’s relationship\n            with each parent, including whether one (1) parent has performed\n            the majority of parenting responsibilities relating to the daily needs\n            of the child;\n\n       The trial court found that Caleb loves both parents and is loved by both parents. It\nfound that Father has a stable relationship with Caleb but that Mother‟s relationship with\nCaleb was disrupted by her decision to move to Australia. The trial court acknowledged\nthat Caleb misses Mother but found that “[Mother] alone chose to act on her desire to\nmarry and move to Australia. She separated herself from Caleb and now wants to\nseparate him from the rest of his family with whom he has shared a very close\nrelationship all of his young life.”\n\n            (2) Each parent’s or caregiver’s past and potential for future\n            performance of parenting responsibilities, including the willingness\n            and ability of each of the parents and caregivers to facilitate and\n            encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between\n            the child and both of the child’s parents, consistent with the best\n\n7\n The trial court‟s order on remand, entered August 26, 2014, referenced the statutory best interest factors\nfound at Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-106(a). The statute was amended to include these\nparticular factors effective July 1, 2014. Prior to the amendment, the applicable statutory factors were\nfound at Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-404(b). “Even prior to the amendment, the analysis\nunder the two statutes was „quite similar.‟” Broadrick, 2015 WL 1947186, at *4 n.2 (quoting Armbrister,\n414 S.W.3d at 697) (noting “significant overlap” and “little substantive difference” between the two\nsections prior to the amendment). The amendment was simply meant to “alleviate inconsistency and\nconfusion” caused by different statutes containing factors pertaining to judicial review of custodial\narrangements and the establishment of residential schedules that “differ[ed] slightly in their specifics.”\nMuhonen v. Muhonen, No. E2013-02601-COA-R3-CV, 2015 WL 740667, at *11 n.5 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nFeb. 20, 2015) (no perm. app. filed). The issues in this case do not require us to reconcile any differences\nin the statutes, so we will discuss the factors analyzed by the trial court for clarity. The statutory factors\nthat are not listed in our discussion were either found inapplicable or equally applicable to both parties\nand did not impact the court‟s analysis.\n                                                      17\n\f           interest of the child. . . . ;\n\n       The trial judge stated in her written order that she had taken notice “of how each\nparent encouraged or discouraged Caleb‟s relationship with the other.” The court noted\nthat Father allowed Mother additional time with Caleb before she left for Australia and\nafter she made the move in order to help Caleb with the transition. In addition, he\npermitted Caleb to participate in Skype sessions with Mother every day. The court also\nnoted that Father allowed Caleb to continue spending time with his maternal\ngrandparents, as he had done in the past. It concluded that Father had “gone to great\nlengths to assure that Mother, and both sets of grandparents, who have been closely\ninvolved with Caleb all of his life, are still a big part of his daily life.”\n\n        On the other hand, the court found that when Caleb is with Mother, “she makes\nlittle effort to direct him toward maintaining contact with his Father and grandparents.”\nFor example, when Caleb is with Mother in Australia, he does not Skype with Father\nevery day, she does not encourage him to talk to Father if he does not want to do so, and\nshe does not encourage Caleb to open his mail. The court found that this conduct\ndamaged Caleb‟s bond with the family members who wrote to him.\n\n           (5) The degree to which a parent has been the primary caregiver,\n        defined as the parent who has taken the greater responsibility for\n        performing parental responsibilities;\n\n        The court noted that Father had been Caleb‟s primary residential parent since\n2011.\n\n            (9) The child’s interaction and interrelationships with siblings,\n        other relatives and step-relatives, and mentors, as well as the child’s\n        involvement with the child’s physical surroundings, school, or other\n        significant activities;\n\n       After reviewing photographs of Caleb in Australia, the court concluded that Caleb\nhas been “enjoying a grand adventure on two continents.” The court noted that Shannon\nhad become involved with Caleb and taught him to swim and ski, and Mother‟s marriage\nto Shannon had been stable for two years. The court noted that when Shannon was asked\nquestions about Caleb‟s friends in Australia, his school work, and his music lessons,\nShannon “seemed to have little information.” Still, the court found that its analysis of\nthis factor was somewhat more favorable to Mother than it had been at the time of the\nrelocation trial, when Mother was recently married to someone she had only dated for a\nfew weeks. The court also mentioned that Mother involved Caleb in the Anglican\nChurch in Australia and that they regularly socialize with other church members. In\n                                            18\n\faddition, the court considered that Caleb had visited Shannon‟s mother and father,\nalthough they lived several hours away from Mother‟s home in Australia. Overall, the\ncourt found that Caleb‟s “personal social circle” is smaller in Australia.\n\n       With regard to Caleb‟s interactions in Memphis, the court noted that Caleb‟s\ngrandparents participate in his day to day life. Although Mother testified that Caleb‟s\nrelationship with his grandparents could continue if he moved to Australia, the court\nrecognized the testimony of Mother‟s father that he and his wife are unlikely to visit\nAustralia due to financial constraints. The court found that Mother‟s expectation that\nFather and the grandparents could travel to Australia to visit Caleb was “impractical due\nto finances, age and distance.” In addition, the court recognized that Caleb had\n“substantially less contact” with both sets of grandparents during his visits to Australia,\nand he received mail in Australia that was never opened. The court concluded that\nMother “apparently makes no effort to direct the child to open all of his mail.”\n\n       As for Caleb‟s activities in Memphis, the court found that he is excelling and “at\nthe top of his class” in elementary school, participating in the CLUE program for gifted\nstudents, and active in the children‟s choir at the church of the maternal grandparents.\nThe court found that Caleb has a large group of friends in Memphis. The court\nconcluded that Caleb “is well adjusted and flourishing” under the current parenting plan.\nThe trial court found that these considerations had “shifted further in Father[‟s] favor”\nsince the relocation trial and that Caleb had “deeper ties with the Memphis community.”\nIt found that Caleb is “doing splendidly in school and would be harmed by being moved\naway” from his community, grandparents, and Father.\n\n           (10) The importance of continuity in the child’s life and the length\n       of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment;\n\n      Regarding this factor, the court noted that Caleb had been in the care of Father\nsince 2011, and he had “spent his entire life visiting regularly with his two sets of\ngrandparents.”\n\n          (14) Each parent’s employment schedule, and the court may make\n       accommodations consistent with those schedules;\n\n        The trial court found that Father works roughly 45 hours per week, in shifts\nstarting as early as 7:30 a.m. and ending as late as 10:30 p.m. The trial court noted that\nFather had already been transferred to a smaller store to enable him to work better hours\nthan he had in the past.\n\n       The trial court acknowledged Mother‟s assertion that a primary residential parent\n                                            19\n\fshould be able to meet all of the child‟s needs and be with him around the clock.\nHowever, the court noted that Mother is now employed Monday through Friday from 9\na.m. to 5 p.m. and “will not be available to take care of Caleb around the clock either.”\nWhen Mother and Shannon are working, Caleb would be in the care of unrelated persons\nrather than grandparents.\n\n       In addition, the trial court rejected Mother‟s argument that Father is “not really\nraising Caleb.” The court found that Father testified “without contradiction, that he is\nwith Caleb every day.” The court found that Father “provided stability for Caleb” by\nallowing him to get “a full night of sleep” at the paternal grandparents‟ house on school\nnights. The trial court recognized the alternative of Caleb going to sleep in one location\nand being awakened and moved after Father‟s late work shift. The court found that under\nthe current schedule:\n\n       Father goes to his mother‟s home to be with Caleb in the evenings if he is\n       not working, stays with the child, gives him his bath and puts him to bed.\n       He doesn‟t leave until Caleb is asleep. When Father works an early shift,\n       his mother gets Caleb up, fed and to school. When Father works a late shift,\n       he comes back to his mother‟s to get Caleb up and take him to school. On\n       other days, Father goes to Caleb‟s school to have lunch with his son. Yes,\n       this is an inventive pattern but it works for Caleb.\n\nIn sum, the trial court concluded that “[w]hether Father parents Caleb in his home or in\nhis Mother‟s home is a distinction without a difference. He is parenting his child when he\nis not working.” With the exception of one trip to Thailand, the trial court found “no\nproof” that Father was spending his time away from work with anyone but Caleb. The\ncourt found that Father “does not spend time dating or with his friends or doing activities\nthat are inappropriate for his son.” The court also noted Father‟s active involvement with\nCaleb‟s school. The trial court found that “Father is involved with the child every day of\nhis life even though Caleb sleeps each school night at his Paternal grandparent‟s home.”\n\n          (15) Any other factors deemed relevant by the court.\n\n      The trial court also noted that Father informed Mother about Caleb‟s weeknight\nschedule for kindergarten prior to implementing the schedule, and rather than\ncomplaining, Mother “replied the next day saying it was good for him to have this\nschedule” and “indicated approval” for Caleb‟s unusual schedule.\n\n        The trial court acknowledged Mother‟s testimony that Caleb misses her but found\nthis to be “the natural consequence of her decision to move to Australia.” The court also\nrecognized that if it designated Mother as primary residential parent and allowed her to\n                                            20\n\frelocate Caleb to Australia, “it is anticipated that he will miss his Father with whom he\nhas daily contact, as well as his paternal grandparents and his maternal grandparents with\nwhom he has nearly daily contact also.” The court concluded that Caleb currently misses\none person, Mother, but he has daily Skype contact with her as well as lengthy periods of\nparenting time in Canberra and in Memphis. However, if Caleb moved to Australia, he\nwould then miss five “people who are significant to him,” and he would be unlikely to\nhave the same level of contact with them that he presently enjoys with Mother because\nthey would be unable to travel as Caleb and Mother do. Considering all of the\ncircumstances and relevant best interest factors, the trial court concluded that “Caleb is\nthriving in Memphis” and determined that “[i]t is in Caleb‟s best interest to continue his\nlife as it has been over the last two years.”\n\n        The evidence does not preponderate against the trial court‟s finding that it is in\nCaleb‟s best interest for Father to continue to be designated as primary residential parent\nrather than moving Caleb to Australia to live with Mother. When determining the best\ninterest of a child, we must consider the concept from the child‟s perspective rather than\nthe parent‟s. White v. Moody, 171 S.W.3d 187, 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004). The statute\nexplicitly requires consideration of “the location of the residences of the parents,” see\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a), and the trial court found that Mother was proposing to\nmove Caleb “to the other side of the planet.” This would render it extremely difficult, if\nnot impossible, for Father and Caleb‟s grandparents to visit him. Moreover, the distance\nbecomes more significant considering the trial court‟s finding that Mother “makes little\neffort to direct [Caleb] toward maintaining contact with his Father and grandparents.”\nFather, on the other hand, goes to “great lengths” to facilitate Caleb‟s relationship with\nMother and with both sets of grandparents. Considering the fact that Mother does not get\nhome from work until 5:30 p.m., she acknowledged the possibility that she would send\nCaleb to summer camp or enroll him in an after-school program if he moved to Australia.\nHe currently goes to bed at 7:30 p.m. In Australia, Caleb does not have family members\nliving nearby who would be available to care for him. We believe it particularly\nsignificant that Caleb is flourishing under the current parenting plan. His participation in\nthe CLUE program and his literacy testing indicate that the current arrangement is\nworking well for Caleb. He is also involved in his church choir, taking violin lessons,\nand regularly participating in activities with a group of friends and classmates.\n\n       Mother‟s only real complaint appears to be the extent of participation by Caleb‟s\npaternal grandparents. She claims that they are raising Caleb rather than Father. At the\noutset, we note that Caleb‟s significant contact with his grandparents is not a new\nphenomenon. At the close of the 2011 relocation trial, prior to Mother‟s move, the trial\ncourt found that Caleb had “been raised by his Mother, his Father, his maternal\ngrandparents and his paternal grandparents,” pursuant to “a nearly ideal co-parenting\nrelationship that included both sets of grandparents and nearly seamless transition from\n                                            21\n\fone home to the other.” Once Mother chose to remove herself from that equation by\nmoving to Australia, Father and the two sets of grandparents were left to pick up the\nslack. Although we agree with the trial court‟s observation that Caleb‟s current schedule\nis unusual and inventive, we also agree with its finding that the schedule “works for\nCaleb.”8 We also agree that Father is in fact parenting Caleb, and he has not abandoned\nhis role as primary residential parent, as Mother alleges.\n\n        At trial, Father conceded that Caleb does not live with him “24/7” but added that\n“[Caleb] sees me almost every time that he‟s awake when he‟s not in school or\nsometimes when he is in school.” Again, Father and the paternal grandparents live\napproximately one mile apart. Father testified that he and Caleb spend time at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house six to seven days a week. When he works the opening shift,\nhe spends the afternoon and evening with Caleb and stays at the paternal grandparents‟\nhouse until after Caleb is asleep. When Father works the mid-day shift, he wakes Caleb\nand takes Caleb to school, then returns in time to have dinner with him and put him to\nbed, leaving after Caleb falls asleep. When Father works the closing shift, he wakes\nCaleb and takes him to school and generally visits him at school for lunch or other\nactivities. Father suggested that it was inappropriate to characterize Caleb‟s time with\nFather and his time with the paternal grandparents “as an either/or proposition” because\n“that would be a fallacy.” He claimed that when Caleb is “with” the paternal\ngrandparents, “more often than not, he is with me. In other words, there‟s significant\noverlap between the two.” He claimed that Caleb was not really spending time with his\ngrandparents as opposed to time with Father because they were generally doing things\ntogether as a family. The evidence supports the trial court‟s finding that Father sees\nCaleb every day and is parenting Caleb despite the fact that Caleb sleeps at the paternal\ngrandparents‟ house. The fact that Father sleeps at his condo one mile away does not\nalter our conclusion as to Caleb‟s best interest. Father is there to wake Caleb in the\nmornings and put him to bed at night, except when he is working. He is deeply involved\nwith Caleb‟s school and attends all of his doctor‟s appointments. Also, as Father testified\nat trial, he makes the ultimate decision with regard to Caleb‟s schedule, not the\ngrandparents. When Father informed Mother of his plan before Caleb entered\nkindergarten, she did not complain but said she thought it was “a good idea,” never\n8\n “[W]hile virtually all divorced parents must work outside the home, and some parents must work\natypical hours, it is not punishment to the parent to consider the effect of [the] work schedule on\nthe child. Rather, it is the court‟s job to ensure that the everyday quality of the child‟s life is not\nsacrificed to meet the parents‟ needs or desires. Consideration of how „child-friendly‟ each\nparent‟s schedule must necessarily be part of that determination.” Wall, 2011 WL 2732269, at\n*28. However, “the fact that the custodial parent has an atypical work schedule, in and of itself,\nshould not necessitate a change in the designation of primary residential parent, if the other\nfactors do not weigh in favor of such a change.” Id. at *27. In this case, the evidence does not\npreponderate against the trial court‟s finding that it is in Caleb‟s best interest to remain in the\nUnited States with Father in spite of his atypical work schedule and child care arrangement.\n                                                       22\n\findicating any disapproval of the arrangement until she filed her petition to modify\nmonths later.\n\n       On appeal, Mother argues that the trial court failed to address her superior parental\nrights as a parent and therefore violated her constitutional rights. She acknowledges that\nthe parties to this action are both biological parents but claims that this case nevertheless\nhas “a factor of superior parental rights to it.” “In custody disputes between parents and\nnon-parents, the comparative fitness analysis cannot be used because it fails to take into\naccount that the custody claims of biological parents and the custody claims of third\nparties do not have the same legal weight.” In re B.C.W., No. M2007-00168-COA-R3-\nJV, 2008 WL 450616, at *2 (Tenn. Ct. App. Feb. 19, 2008) (citing Ray v. Ray, 83 S.W.3d\n726, 731 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2001)). When faced with “a contest between a parent and a\nnon-parent,” the parent cannot be deprived of custody of his or her child “unless there has\nbeen a finding, after notice required by due process, of substantial harm to the child.”\nBlair v. Badenhope, 77 S.W.3d 137, 142 (Tenn. 2002) (citation omitted).9 “Only then\nmay a court engage in a general „best interest of the child‟ evaluation in making a\ndetermination of custody.” Id. Clearly, “the standard applied to custody disputes\nbetween parents and non-parents [] is very different from the standard applied to disputes\ninvolving two parents.” In re R.D.H., No. M2006-00837-COA-R3-JV, 2007 WL\n2403352, at *6 (Tenn. Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2007). This case, however, involves a contest\nbetween Mother and Father, and Father was awarded custody of Caleb. This case does\nnot involve a custody contest between a parent and a non-parent. Therefore, the superior\nparental rights doctrine is inapplicable.\n\n       Mother also argues that Father fails to meet the definition of a “primary residential\nparent” under Tennessee law. She notes that Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-\n402 provides, “As used in this part, unless the context requires otherwise,” a “[p]rimary\nresidential parent means the parent with whom the child resides more than fifty percent\n(50%) of the time.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(4). A “[p]ermanent parenting plan” is\ndescribed as “a written plan for the parenting and best interests of the child, including the\nallocation of parenting responsibilities and the establishment of a residential schedule[.]”\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(3). The statute defines a “[r]esidential schedule” as “the\nschedule of when the child is in each parent‟s physical care” and provides that a\nresidential schedule “shall designate in which parent‟s home each minor child shall reside\non given days of the year, including provisions for holidays, birthdays of family\nmembers, vacations, and other special occasions, consistent with the criteria of this part.”\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(5). We acknowledge that Father‟s current arrangement for\nCaleb does not fit neatly within the parameters of these definitions. However, neither did\n9\n In this case, the trial court did find that Caleb would be “harmed” by moving his primary residence to\nAustralia. However, the court did not make a finding of substantial harm to the child as would be\nrequired under the superior parental rights doctrine.\n                                                      23\n\fthe March 1, 2012 parenting plan entered following the relocation trial. In fact, the\npermanent parenting plan stated, “Due to the fact the Mother and Step-Father currently\nreside in Australia, there shall be no regular day-to-day schedule as in the typical\nParenting Plan Orders entered in this Court.” Notably, the statute also provides the\nfollowing definition of “[p]arenting responsibilities”:\n\n             (2) “Parenting responsibilities” means those aspects of the parent-\n      child relationship in which the parent makes decisions and performs duties\n      necessary for the care and growth of the child. “Parenting responsibilities,”\n      the establishment of which is the objective of a permanent parenting plan,\n      include:\n                     (A) Providing for the child‟s emotional care and\n             stability, including maintaining a loving, stable, consistent,\n             and nurturing relationship with the child and supervising the\n             child to encourage and protect emotional, intellectual, moral,\n             and spiritual development;\n                     (B) Providing for the child‟s physical care, including\n             attending to the daily needs of the child, such as feeding,\n             clothing, physical care, and grooming, supervision, health\n             care, and day care, and engaging in other activities that are\n             appropriate to the developmental level of the child and that\n             are within the social and economic circumstances of the\n             particular family;\n                     (C) Providing encouragement and protection of the\n             child‟s intellectual and moral development, including\n             attending to adequate education for the child, including\n             remedial or other education essential to the best interests of\n             the child;\n                     (D) Assisting the child in developing and maintaining\n             appropriate interpersonal relationships;\n                     (E) Exercising appropriate judgment regarding the\n             child‟s welfare, consistent with the child‟s developmental\n             level and the family‟s social and economic circumstances;\n             and\n                     (F) Providing any financial security and support of the\n             child in addition to child support obligations[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402. Even though Caleb sleeps at the home of the paternal\ngrandparents on school nights, Father is fulfilling all of the aforementioned parenting\nresponsibilities. Our consideration of the aforementioned definitions does not alter the\noutcome in this case.\n                                           24\n\f        After reviewing the trial court‟s thorough and clearly articulated findings, we find\nno evidence that the court applied an incorrect legal standard, reached an illogical\nconclusion, or based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. See\nKelly, 445 S.W.3d at 696. “Appellate courts should reverse custody decisions „only\nwhen the trial court‟s ruling falls outside the spectrum of rulings that might reasonably\nresult from an application of the correct legal standards to the evidence.‟” Id. (quoting\nArmbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 693). Here, the trial court applied the proper legal standards,\nand its custody ruling falls well within the spectrum of possible reasonable results.\nAffording the trial court the deference it deserves in ascribing credibility and weight to\nthe witnesses‟ testimony, see id., we find no basis to overturn the trial court‟s designation\nof Father as Caleb‟s primary residential parent.\n\n                                   B.   Attorney’s Fees\n\n       Finally, Father argues that the trial court erred by declining to award him the\nattorney‟s fees he incurred in connection with defending against the petition to modify.\nBoth Mother and Father request an award of attorney‟s fees incurred on appeal. In the\nprevious appeal of this matter, we considered Father‟s argument that the trial court erred\nin denying his request for attorney‟s fees but stated:\n\n       In its order [of] June 8, 2011, the trial court simply states that Father‟s\n       request for attorney‟s fees is denied, and provides no explanation for its\n       decision. Again, the lack of explanation in the court‟s order stymies our\n       ability to review the court‟s decision for an abuse of discretion.\n       Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the order denying Father‟s\n       attorney‟s fees and remand for specific findings concerning the trial court‟s\n       reasons for the denial of Father‟s request.\n\nKathryne B.F., 2014 WL 992110, at *8. On remand, the trial court entered a lengthy\norder providing the reasons for its decisions on the parenting issues, but the order failed\nto address the issue of attorney‟s fees. The order simply stated that “all motions and\npetitions heretofore filed, but not specifically addressed, are denied.”\n\n        Apparently, neither party directed the trial court‟s attention to the issue of\nattorney‟s fees on remand. After the trial court entered its order on remand with no\nmention of the issue, either party could have filed a post-trial motion noting the trial\ncourt‟s omission in order to avoid the potential for an additional remand and prolonged\nlitigation. See In re Noah J., No. W2014-01778-COA-R3-JV, 2015 WL 1332665, at *5\nn.5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 23, 2015) (no perm. app. filed) (“In order to save time and\nmoney, parties who receive an order that fails to comply with Rule 52.01 have the option\n                                             25\n\fof seeking correction of that deficiency in the trial court by filing a motion under Rule\n52.02 „to amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the\njudgment would be required if the motion is granted.‟”) (quoting Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.01).\nAs it is, we are left with a bare denial of Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees with no\nexplanation of the trial court‟s reasoning in either of its written orders. Nevertheless, in\nthe interest of justice and economy, in order to avoid a second remand, before a different\ntrial judge,10 we have reviewed the original trial judge‟s oral remarks and the entire\nrecord in order to address the issue of attorney‟s fees. At the conclusion of the original\nhearing on the petition to modify, after the trial judge announced her decision to dismiss\nMother‟s petition, Father‟s counsel pointed out his prayer for attorney‟s fees and asked if\nthe trial court would permit him to file an affidavit of attorney‟s fees at a later date and\nset the matter for hearing. The trial judge simply responded, “I don‟t believe I would\naward attorney fees this time.” She added, however, that she would be “more inclined”\nto award attorney‟s fees in the future if Mother continued to file repeated petitions to\nmodify with “as little proof” as she presented in support of this petition.\n\n           Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c) provides:\n           (c) The plaintiff spouse may recover from the defendant spouse, and the\n           spouse or other person to whom the custody of the child, or children, is\n           awarded may recover from the other spouse reasonable attorney fees\n           incurred in enforcing any decree for alimony and/or child support, or in\n           regard to any suit or action concerning the adjudication of the custody or\n           the change of custody of any child, or children, of the parties, both upon the\n           original divorce hearing and at any subsequent hearing, which fees may be\n           fixed and allowed by the court, before whom such action or proceeding is\n           pending, in the discretion of such court.\n\n“„[I]n cases involving the custody and support of children, . . . it has long been the rule in\nthis State that counsel fees incurred on behalf of minors may be recovered when shown to\nbe reasonable and appropriate.‟” Taylor v. Fezell, 158 S.W.3d 352, 360 (Tenn. 2005)\n(quoting Deas v. Deas, 774 S.W.2d 167, 169 (Tenn. 1989)). There is no absolute right to\nsuch fees, but “„their award in custody and support proceedings is familiar and almost\ncommonplace.‟” Id. (quoting Deas, 774 S.W.2d at 170). The allowance of attorney‟s\nfees “is for the benefit of the child, and the custodial spouse should not have to bear the\nexpense incurred on the child‟s behalf.‟” Huntley v. Huntley, 61 S.W.3d 329, 341 (Tenn.\nCt. App. 2001) (citing Ragan v. Ragan, 858 S.W.2d 332, 334 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1993)); see\nalso Sherrod v. Wix, 849 S.W.2d 780, 785 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1992) (explaining that the\npurpose of these awards is to protect the child‟s legal remedies, not the custodial\nparent‟s).     “Accordingly, requiring parents who precipitate custody or support\n\n10\n     We take judicial notice of the fact that the original trial judge has retired.\n                                                          26\n\fproceedings to underwrite the costs if their claims are ultimately found to be unwarranted\nis appropriate as a matter of policy.” Sherrod, 849 S.W.2d at 785.\n\n        In the case at bar, in making its decision regarding attorney‟s fees, the trial court\ndid not comply with our previous mandate and did not explain the required legal standard\nor what reasoning it employed. The trial judge‟s oral remarks indicate only that she was\nnot inclined to award attorney‟s fees “this time.” However, the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt has stated that “„[d]iscretionary choices are not left to a court‟s inclination, but to\nits judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.‟” State v. Lewis,\n235 S.W.3d 136, 141 (Tenn. 2007) (quoting Martha S. Davis, Standards of Review:\nJudicial Review of Discretionary Decisionmaking, 2 J. App. Prac. & Process 47, 58\n(2000)). Thus, an abuse of discretion will be found “when the trial court . . . fails to\nproperly consider the factors on that issue given by the higher courts to guide the\ndiscretionary determination.” Id.; see also Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d at 105 (“An abuse of\ndiscretion occurs when the trial court causes an injustice by applying an incorrect legal\nstandard[.]”).\n\n         Having reviewed the entire record, however, we likewise conclude that Father\nshould not be awarded his attorney‟s fees at the trial level. We recognize that Mother\nfiled her petition to modify within a year of the entry of the March 1, 2012 permanent\nparenting plan entered as a result of the relocation trial. We also note that Mother does\nnot pay child support for the child to assist Father with the cost of raising him. However,\nFather does not cite to any information in the record regarding his ability to pay\nattorney‟s fees, and we are not aware of any. The “ability to pay should not be the\ncontrolling consideration with regard to awards for legal expenses in custody or support\nproceedings,” but it “is certainly a factor to be considered.” Sherrod, 849 S.W.2d at 785.\nCourts may award attorney‟s fees without proof that the requesting party is unable to pay\nthem as long as the award is just and equitable under the facts of the case. Id. Although\nMother did not prevail at the trial court level, her allegations were not totally\nunwarranted, as we have determined that she did successfully demonstrate a material\nchange in circumstances. The record contains no information regarding the amount of\nattorney‟s fees incurred by either party. Considering all of the circumstances in this case\nand the scarce financial evidence pertaining to the issue of attorney‟s fees, we conclude\nthat it is just and equitable to require both parties to pay the attorney‟s fees they incurred\nat the trial level.\n\n       As noted above, both parties seek an award of attorney‟s fees on appeal.\nTennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c) also applies to awards of attorney‟s fees\nincurred on appeal and vests in this Court the discretionary authority to award fees and\ncosts in proper cases. Pippin v. Pippin, 277 S.W.3d 398, 407 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008). A\nparty who does not prevail on appeal with regard to the parenting arrangement at issue\n                                             27\n\fwill not be awarded fees on appeal. Miller v. Miller, 336 S.W.3d 578, 586-87 Tenn. Ct.\nApp. 2010) (citing Smith v. Smith, 984 S.W.2d 606, 610 (Tenn. Ct. App. 1997)).\nConsequently, Mother‟s request for attorney‟s fees on appeal is denied. As for Father‟s\nrequest, we note that he was, overall, successful in defending against Mother‟s petition to\nmodify. However, we found merit in one issue raised by Mother -- regarding the\nexistence of a material change in circumstance. Again, we have no information in the\nrecord regarding Father‟s ability or inability to pay his attorney‟s fees. Exercising our\ndiscretion in this case, we respectfully deny Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees on\nappeal.\n\n                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the circuit court is hereby affirmed\nin part and reversed in part. Costs of this appeal are taxed to the appellant, Kathryne\nB.F., and her surety, for which execution may issue if necessary.\n\n\n\n                                                 _________________________________\n                                                 BRANDON O.

When the parties divorced in 2008,\nMother was designated primary residential parent of the parties‟ one-year-old son.\nMother later remarried and sought permission to relocate to Australia with the child.\nFollowing a hearing in 2011, the trial court denied Mother‟s request to relocate and\nchanged the designation of primary residential parent to Father. Mother moved to\nAustralia with her new husband. Mother instituted this proceeding in 2013, alleging that\na material change in circumstance has occurred and that it is in the child‟s best interest to\nlive with her in Australia. The trial court considered testimony over the course of four\ndays and eventually dismissed Mother‟s petition. In a previous appeal, this Court\nremanded the matter for specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court\nsubsequently entered a lengthy written order explaining its decision. Mother filed a\nsecond notice of appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n Tenn. R.

FACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n      Michael David B. (“Father”) and Kathryne B.F. (“Mother”) were divorced by\ndecree of the Shelby County Circuit Court in July 2008. The parties had one child,\n\fCaleb, who was born in October 2006. The trial court entered a permanent parenting\nplan designating Mother the primary residential parent of one-year-old Caleb. Father was\nto have parenting time with Caleb three days per week but at varying times due to his\natypical work schedule. Father is employed as an assistant manager at Walgreen‟s, and\nin any given week, he works a combination of different shifts between the hours of 7:30\na.m. and 10:30 p.m.\n\n        In January 2011, Father filed a petition opposing Mother‟s removal of the child\nfrom the jurisdiction of the court. According to the petition, Mother was engaged to an\nAustralian and planning to relocate with Caleb to Australia. Father sought an order\ndenying Mother‟s request to relocate in accordance with Tennessee‟s parental relocation\nstatute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108. Mother filed a response and a counter-petition\nseeking the entry of a revised parenting plan that would enable her to relocate to\nAustralia with four-year-old Caleb. Mother married her fiancé on March 6, 2011.\n\n       The trial court held a hearing on March 24, 2011, and considered the testimony of\nFather, Mother, Mother‟s new husband, and Caleb‟s paternal grandmother. The court\nissued a letter ruling on May 5, 2011. The court found that since Caleb was born, the\nparties had enjoyed “a nearly ideal co-parenting relationship that included both sets of\ngrandparents and nearly seamless transition from one home to the other.” In fact, the\ncourt found that “the child has been raised by his Mother, his Father, his maternal\ngrandparents and his paternal grandparents.” The court noted the parties‟ agreement that\nCaleb was spending substantially more time with Mother than with Father, within the\nmeaning of the parental relocation statute, but the court observed that “if you segregate\nout the time spent with grandparents, then the parents are more nearly equal.” In any\nevent, the court concluded that moving Caleb to Australia posed a threat of specific and\nserious harm to the child that outweighed the threat of harm from a change of custody.\nSee Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(d)(1)(B). The court noted that Mother was proposing to\nmove Caleb not just to another part of this state or country but rather to “the other side of\nthe globe,” with a significant time zone differential and even opposite seasons. The court\nfound that Mother‟s proposed move would separate Caleb “from all he has known, from\nall of his family and extended family except his Mother by almost half the planet.”\nHaving found a threat of specific and serious harm to the child, the trial court was\nrequired to determine whether to permit relocation based on the best interest of the child.\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(e). The court found that many of the best interest factors\nweighed equally in favor of Mother and Father, while others were inapplicable due to\nCaleb‟s young age. However, the court found that the factor regarding the importance of\ncontinuity in the child‟s life and the length of time he had lived in a stable, satisfactory\nenvironment weighed heavily in Father‟s favor. The court concluded that placing Caleb\nwith Father was advantageous because it “would permit him to continue to be involved\nwith his Father and both sets of grandparents as he is accustomed to being.” “That is to\n                                             2\n\fsay,” the court explained, “[Caleb] will now be supported by [a] three-legged stool,\nwhereas in the past he had a four-legged stool. Were he to move to Australia, his stool\nwould have but one leg.” The court also considered the stability of each parent‟s family\nunit and concluded that this factor also weighed in Father‟s favor because Mother had\nonly recently married her current husband, whom she met on the Internet and dated “face\nto face” only a few weeks prior to their marriage. The court noted the testimony of\nMother‟s husband that he had little experience with children and was not a “child guy.”\nConsidering all of these factors, the trial court concluded that relocating to Australia was\nnot in Caleb‟s best interest. Accordingly, the court denied Mother‟s request to relocate\nCaleb to Australia and designated Father as primary residential parent. The court entered\na written order granting Father‟s petition in opposition to removal on June 8, 2011, nunc\npro tunc to the date of the letter ruling, May 5, 2011. The trial court directed the parties\nto either tender a modified parenting plan reached by consent or submit proposed plans\nfor the court to consider. However, due to disputes regarding various issues, the parties\ndid not reach an agreement regarding a permanent parenting plan for several months.\n\n       In the meantime, Mother moved to Australia on June 3, 2011. Caleb spent\napproximately six weeks with Mother in Australia during June and July 2011.\nThereafter, Mother returned to the United States with Caleb and stayed for about eight\nweeks to aid in his transition. She returned to Australia in September 2011. After\nMother‟s return to Australia, Caleb‟s paternal grandmother emailed to Mother a summary\nof “the schedule we follow for Caleb‟s care.” The email stated, in pertinent part:\n\n       Carol [maternal grandmother] picks Caleb up from Michelle [paternal\n       grandmother] Tuesdays at 9:30 am. - Caleb is there overnight Tues., Wed.\n\n       Michelle picks Caleb up from Carol Thursdays at 9:30 am. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Thurs., Fri.\n\n       Carol picks Caleb up from Michelle Saturdays at 6:00 p.m. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Sat.\n\n       Michelle picks Caleb up from Carol Sundays at 1:30 p.m. - Caleb is there\n       overnight Sun., Mon.\n\n       [Father] gets Caleb from whichever grandmother has him when he is off;\n       and delivers him back to whichever grandmother is scheduled to keep him\n       when he has to go back to work. For instance, I didn‟t keep Caleb\n       yesterday (Thursday) because [Father] was off. He brought him to me\n       today (Friday) at noon before he left for a 1:30-11:00 p.m. work shift at\n       Walgreens.\n                                             3\n\fMother thanked the paternal grandmother for the information about Caleb‟s schedule\nwithout objection. Caleb had another extended visit in Australia for approximately six\nweeks during December 2011 and January 2012.\n\n        A modified permanent parenting plan was finally entered on March 1, 2012. The\nparenting plan provided that Mother would have “several long-term periods of parenting\ntime with the child each calendar year in Australia” and “additional parenting time with\nthe child here in Shelby County, Tennessee, with the dates to be determined by the\nparties by agreement[.]” Caleb would primarily reside with Mother during the periods\nwhen she returned to the United States, but not to exceed six weeks annually. During\nsuch periods, “the Father[] and his family” would have weekly parenting time. Mother\nwas not required to pay child support to Father, but she was fully responsible for Caleb‟s\ntransportation costs for his visits to Australia. The parenting plan stated that Father\nagreed to provide extra time to Mother in the upcoming year since Caleb was not yet\nenrolled in “formal” school. It also provided that Caleb‟s maternal grandparents were\nentitled to visitation with him during the first and third weekends of each month from\nSaturday at 6 p.m. until Sunday at 1:30 p.m., pursuant to Tennessee‟s grandparent\nvisitation statute, Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-306. Father was required to “provide for the\nchild‟s care with either set of grandparents as the primary option.” He was also required\nto notify Mother if he planned to be “absent from the child” for more than three\nconsecutive days.\n\n        Caleb spent two months in Australia during the summer of 2012. Upon returning\nto Memphis, he began kindergarten in August 2012. The week before school began,\nFather emailed Mother regarding his plans for Caleb during the upcoming school year.\nFather informed Mother that he planned for Caleb to spend every school night at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house in order to “keep him stable and grounded in a routine as\nmuch as possible” and avoid “bounc[ing] him between three beds during his\nschoolweek.” Father informed Mother that the maternal grandparents would have time\nwith Caleb “most weekends” from Saturday at 5 p.m. to Sunday at 1:30 p.m. He would\nalso allow Caleb to spend Wednesday afternoons with the maternal grandparents from the\ntime he was released from school until they finished attending church service on\nWednesday evenings so that Caleb could participate in the church choir. Mother\nresponded by thanking Father for the information and stating, “I think it‟s a good idea for\nhim to have the consistency of one bed during the school week while also keeping his\nconnection with my family and the continuation of his longstanding church activities.”\n\n      Mother returned to the United States for two weeks in October 2012 around\nCaleb‟s sixth birthday. During such visits, Mother and Caleb would typically stay at the\nmaternal grandparents‟ house, and Caleb would visit with Father and the paternal\n                                            4\n\fgrandparents from Friday night until Sunday afternoon.\n\n       On January 31, 2013, Mother initiated the instant proceeding by filing a petition to\nmodify the March 1, 2012 parenting plan. By that time, Caleb was mid-way through\nkindergarten. Mother alleged that even though Father was designated as Caleb‟s primary\nresidential parent, Caleb was primarily residing with his paternal grandparents, and they\nwere actually raising him rather than Father. Mother acknowledged that “it was\ncontemplated that the child would enjoy time with both sets of grandparents,” but she\nclaimed that “it certainly was not contemplated by Mother or the Court that the Father\nwould defer his parenting responsibilities to the paternal grandmother and that she would\nbe the primary caregiver of the minor child.” Mother therefore claimed that a material\nchange in circumstance existed and that it was in Caleb‟s best interest to reside with her\nin Australia. Mother submitted a proposed permanent parenting plan that designated her\nas primary residential parent and provided Father with “several long-term periods of\nparenting time” each year in the United States and in Australia. Pursuant to Mother‟s\nproposed parenting plan, Caleb would travel to the United States four times per year\nduring breaks from his school in Australia. The plan provided that Caleb would get to\nspend the night with his grandparents at least one night per week when he was visiting\nthe United States. Father filed a response denying that Caleb was residing with the\npaternal grandparents and denying that Mother was entitled to relief.\n\n       The trial court heard testimony over the course of four days between April and\nJune 2013. Caleb was six and a half years old. Mother had been residing in Canberra,\nAustralia, for about two years.1 She and her husband resided in a two-bedroom\napartment. Mother worked at a university from around 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through\nFriday. Because Mother worked five days per week and arrived home as late as 5:30, she\nacknowledged the possibility that she would enroll Caleb in an after-school program or\nsummer camp if he moved to Australia. Mother testified that Caleb spent a total of about\nfive months visiting her in Australia over the course of the past two years and that he had\nmade friends there. Mother testified that Caleb had also developed a warm relationship\nwith her current husband, Shannon, who had taught Caleb to swim, snow ski, and boogie\nboard.\n\n       Mother testified that when Caleb is in the United States, she communicates with\nhim nearly every day via Skype video chat. She testified that their average Skype\nsessions last about thirty minutes and occur after Caleb gets home from school in the\nafternoon, which equates to early morning in Australia before Mother leaves for work.\nShe testified that when Caleb is visiting Australia, he also communicates with Father via\nSkype several times a week depending on his work schedule. Mother suggested that\n\n1\n    Mother testified that Canberra is the capital of Australia and a city of about 370,000 residents.\n                                                         5\n\fFather and Caleb‟s grandparents could maintain active involvement in Caleb‟s life even if\nhe moved to Australia by using Skype and sending letters and care packages. During\ncross-examination, however, Mother identified several unopened letters that were\naddressed to Caleb in Australia and mailed by his paternal grandmother. Mother testified\nthat she gave the letters to Caleb, and he did not choose to open them, so she placed them\nin his backpack when he returned to the United States.\n\n       Mother testified that she filed the petition to modify because she did not believe\nthat Father was fulfilling his obligations as primary residential parent. She testified that,\nbased on her observation, Father was not spending any more time with Caleb than he did\nwhen Father was designated the alternate residential parent prior to Mother‟s move to\nAustralia. She noted that Caleb had been spending every school night at the home of the\npaternal grandparents and also spending time with her parents most weekends. Mother\nclaimed that when she stated in her email that Father‟s plan for school nights was “a good\nidea,” she simply agreed that Caleb needed consistency during the school week, and she\nwas not advocating for him to stay with the grandparents. Mother admitted that Father\nwas a good father but claimed that he failed to make Caleb the priority in his life.\n\n       Mother testified that if Caleb was permitted to move to Australia, he would attend\na nearby school and have four breaks from school annually – three two-week breaks\nthroughout the year and a six-week break around Christmas. Mother proposed that Caleb\nspend each of the two-week breaks and half of his Christmas break in the United States.\nShe testified that Father and Caleb‟s grandparents would be welcome to visit him in\nAustralia as well. Mother conceded that traveling between the United States and\nAustralia is “not easy,” but she insisted that it was realistic to expect the grandparents to\nmake the trip. She acknowledged, though, that her parents had never visited her in\nAustralia. She testified that the cost of flights from Canberra “all the way to Memphis”\nor vice versa was between $1,500 and $1,800. She mentioned the fact that she had spent\n“thousands of dollars” on plane tickets for herself and for Caleb. If Caleb were permitted\nto relocate, Mother proposed that Father be responsible for all of Caleb‟s transportation\ncosts in lieu of paying child support.\n\n        Mother claimed that she had been “consistently the most important person” in\nCaleb‟s life. She did not foresee any harm to Caleb by moving him to Australia. She\ndescribed Caleb as resilient and noted that he was an excellent student. However, she\nacknowledged that some stress indicators were “showing up in his life.” For example, he\nrecently had problems with urinary urgency, which a pediatric urologist diagnosed as\nstress-related.\n\n       Mother‟s husband, Shannon, testified via Skype from Australia. He also worked\nat a university in Australia. He generally worked weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,\n                                             6\n\fwith some flexibility. He described his relationship with Caleb as “excellent.” Shannon\ntestified that his previous statement about not being a “child guy” was taken out of\ncontext, and that he simply meant that he lacked experience with children. He said he\nwas really enjoying “doing the parenting role” with Caleb. Shannon‟s mother and father\nalso resided in Australia, but the drive to his mother‟s house was fourteen hours and the\ndrive to his father‟s house was seven hours. Caleb had visited them once or twice. Like\nMother, Shannon believed that Caleb‟s relationships with Father and his grandparents\nwere “not as important or essential to Caleb‟s wellbeing as being with his mother.”\nShannon suggested that he and Mother would also benefit financially if Caleb were\npermitted to move to Australia because they were currently “spending so much money”\non travel expenses. In other words, he believed that the cost of raising Caleb full-time\nwould be less than the amount he was currently spending on travel expenses.\n\n        Mother‟s parents, Caleb‟s maternal grandparents, also testified. At the time of\ntrial, Caleb was spending time at their home on Wednesday evenings and “usually”\novernight on Saturdays. The maternal grandfather testified that before Caleb started\nschool, he spent about three nights per week at their home, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,\nand Saturdays. Prior to that schedule, when Mother still lived in the United States, she\nand Caleb resided with the maternal grandparents for “a number of months” and then\nmoved into a house “two doors down” from the maternal grandparents. Caleb‟s\ngrandfather acknowledged that Caleb is well adjusted in Memphis and doing well, but he\nbelieved that Caleb was most closely bonded to Mother and that he should reside in\nAustralia with her. He testified that he and his wife had not visited Australia to date\nbecause they were not financially able to do so. He explained that even though they\ncould stay with Mother and avoid a lodging expense, the cost of flights was simply too\nexpensive.\n\n       Mother‟s mother testified that all of Caleb‟s grandparents had always been very\ninvolved in his life. When Mother was living near the maternal grandparents and\nemployed, the maternal grandmother served as Caleb‟s primary babysitter. She testified\nthat when Mother moved to Australia, Mother told her that she intended to build a life\nand network of support in Australia and then come back to the United States and seek to\nregain custody of Caleb. The maternal grandmother testified that when Mother moved to\nAustralia, she discussed childcare plans with Father and Caleb‟s paternal grandmother\nand, with a “collaborative effort,” they worked out a schedule where each set of\ngrandparents would care for Caleb on certain days of the week. “If it worked out so that\n[Father] had time off in his schedule where he could have Caleb overnight,” the maternal\ngrandmother would defer to Father. However, the maternal grandmother estimated that\nshe only deferred to Father for overnight stays occasionally, “[m]aybe a couple of times a\nmonth.” Otherwise, before Caleb started kindergarten, she had him overnight on\nTuesdays, when he attended a church Mother‟s Day Out program, Wednesdays, when he\n                                            7\n\fhad choir practice, and Saturdays, when he had church the next day. Once Caleb started\nkindergarten, she began keeping him Wednesday afternoons until Father picked him up\nfrom church, in addition to Saturday nights until Sunday after church. The maternal\ngrandmother admitted that Caleb loves both his parents. She said that Caleb “doesn‟t\nlack for physical needs” in Memphis and acknowledged that he is enrolled in a very good\nschool. However, she believed that Father did not have the same emotional connection\nwith Caleb that Mother had. The maternal grandmother confirmed that she and her\nhusband had not visited Australia for financial reasons.\n\n      Mother‟s younger sister testified that she traveled with Caleb to Australia in the\nsummer of 2012 and cared for him while Mother and Shannon were at work. She resided\nin Memphis but also believed that Caleb should reside with Mother in Australia so that\nMother could provide consistency for Caleb.\n\n       Mother had hired a private investigator to conduct surveillance of Father and the\npaternal grandmother over the course of eight days. During that time, however, the\ninvestigator saw Caleb only three to four times. One of those times, he saw Caleb with\nFather; the other times he was with the paternal grandmother. The investigator also\nconfirmed the fact that Father was working at Walgreen‟s.\n\n      At the conclusion of Mother‟s proof, Father moved to dismiss based on the lack of\nproof of a material change in circumstances. The trial court declined to rule on the\nmotion until it heard Father‟s proof.\n\n        As noted above, Father was employed as an assistant manager at Walgreen‟s. He\ntestified that he had been employed at Walgreen‟s for nearly ten years. He testified that\nhe generally works five days a week, and he had already been transferred, by request, to a\nlocation with the minimum number of work hours required for his position. He said he\nbasically runs the store location where he is assigned, making personnel decisions and\nschedules, ordering inventory, and “the whole gamut.” He testified that his work\nschedule varies from week to week and depends on the schedules of other lower\nmanagers, warehouse shipments, and other factors. Generally, Father works either an\nopening shift from roughly 7:30 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m.; a mid-day shift such as 9 a.m. to 5\np.m.; or a closing shift from about 2 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. His commute to or from work\nalso takes about twenty minutes. He said he typically works the closing shift once a\nweek but sometimes twice a week. Father said he tries to schedule his closing shifts for\nSaturdays when Caleb is staying with the maternal grandparents. About once every three\nweeks, Father must arrive at the store around 5:30 a.m. to receive a warehouse shipment.\n\n      Father acknowledged the role that both sets of grandparents play in Caleb‟s life.\nHe noted that Caleb and Mother lived with the maternal grandparents for about a year\n                                            8\n\fafter the parties‟ separation, and even after Mother moved out, she still lived two doors\ndown. He described Caleb‟s maternal grandmother as “one of the bedrocks” in Caleb‟s\nlife. Father said that his own mother had recently retired from her job as a school teacher\nand “made it her primary mission to help with the raising and nurturing of Caleb.” He\nsaid that both grandmothers used a curriculum to teach and instruct Caleb before he\nentered kindergarten that greatly benefitted his intellectual development.\n\n       Father testified that, after Mother moved to Australia, he set out specific days of\nthe week when each set of grandparents would have Caleb if Father was working, so that\nthe grandparents would not be at the mercy of his changing schedule each week. For\nexample, on Tuesdays, the schedule “defaulted” to the maternal grandparents unless\nFather was off work. Father testified that aside from his work hours, he was with Caleb.\nHe said, “whichever days I was off, I would have him for the entirety of that day,” and in\naddition, “[i]f it was a day that I was working, if he was at my mother‟s house I would be\nover there as soon as I finished work.”\n\n         When the time came for Caleb to begin kindergarten, Father said he became\nuncomfortable with Caleb “getting tossed around a little more than I wanted him to be.”\nFather wanted Caleb to have the stability of sleeping in one bed during the school week.\nHowever, Father explained that when he was scheduled for a closing shift on a\nweeknight, he would not get home until after 10 p.m., and he did not want to wake Caleb\nat that hour and take him home. As a result, Father decided to have Caleb sleep at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house on weeknights. He said this decision gave Caleb structure\nand a routine but did not change anything in terms of his interaction with Father. Father\nexplained that he was still with Caleb for “the waking hours.” Father said this\narrangement was easier on all parties except himself, as it required him to go to his\nparents‟ house six to seven days a week, much more often than he normally would have.\nFather said “our typical week involves me living out of their house half the time, is what\nit -- is what it feels like.” However, according to Father, the arrangement benefitted the\npaternal grandparents and Caleb. Father said that Caleb already had his own room at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house, which was “part of what he called home.”\n\n        Father testified that Caleb wakes around 6:15 a.m. and goes to bed at night at 7:30\np.m. Father lives in a condominium “maybe a mile” from the paternal grandparents‟\nhome, so it takes him about two minutes to get there. Father said that when he is not at\nwork, he wakes Caleb up “[p]retty much” every single morning and takes him to school\nat 7:30 a.m. He estimated that he takes Caleb to school about three times a week. When\nFather must work the opening shift, the paternal grandmother takes Caleb to school.\nWhen Caleb gets out of school at 2:10 p.m., Father picks him up if he is not working. If\nFather is working, the paternal grandmother or grandfather will pick him up. Father\ntestified that many days when he works the late shift and will not be able to see Caleb\n                                            9\n\fafter school, he has lunch with Caleb at his school or participates in the parent reading\nprogram and the parent watch dog program. He said he visited Caleb‟s school over thirty\ntimes during his kindergarten school year and had lunch with him about once a week.\nAccording to Father, Caleb‟s teachers said that he was the most involved father with the\nclass. He attended field trips, plays, holiday programs, and other events. Father testified\nthat he also attends all of Caleb‟s doctor visits. Caleb did exceptionally well in\nkindergarten and tested into the school‟s CLUE program for gifted students. At the end\nof the school year, Caleb took a literacy test that indicated he was reading beyond a sixth-\ngrade level.\n\n       Father testified that Caleb generally has a Skype session with Mother immediately\nafter school, then he and Caleb have a few hours to play games or work on school\nprojects. Caleb also takes violin lessons. After dinner, Father gives Caleb a bath,\nbrushes his teeth, puts in him bed, and says his prayers with him. Father testified that he\nsometimes falls asleep with Caleb. However, he generally leaves about an hour after\nCaleb falls asleep. This is Caleb‟s routine from Sunday to Thursday nights; unless Father\nis working, he stays at the paternal grandparents‟ house every night until an hour or so\nafter Caleb falls asleep. On Friday nights, Father and Caleb regularly go to dinner and a\nlocal skating rink with some of Caleb‟s friends and classmates, then Caleb stays\novernight at Father‟s condo. On Saturdays, Father and Caleb generally go for outings\neither by themselves or with the paternal grandparents.\n\n        Even though the permanent parenting plan provided for Saturday night visitation\nwith the maternal grandparents only on alternating weekends, Father said he generally let\nCaleb stay with the maternal grandparents about three out of four Saturday nights. Father\ntestified that Caleb‟s maternal grandparents wanted Caleb to attend church services with\nthem on Wednesday nights, so he also agreed for them to pick Caleb up from school on\nWednesdays. Father then picks Caleb up from church, takes him to the paternal\ngrandparents‟ house, and puts him to bed. Father noted that it‟s just “the two of us” for\nthe routine on Wednesday nights because the paternal grandmother also has church choir\npractice. Father claimed that he and Caleb are alone together “a lot of times” during the\nweek, as they sometimes go to his condo after school.\n\n       Overall, Father claimed that he, his parents, and Mother‟s parents work together\n“as a team” like “a well-oiled machine.” Father identified his email to Mother prior to\nhis implementation of the modified kindergarten schedule. He said after Mother wrote\nback stating that she thought it was “a good idea,” he never heard any complaint from\nMother about the schedule until he was served with the petition to modify months later.\nFather said he experimented with having Caleb stay at his home for the last few weeks of\nthe school year and said “[i]t is possible.” However, he said that the arrangement\nrequired someone to stay at his house late until he gets home from working the closing\n                                            10\n\fshift, so it was harder on his “support team.”\n\n       Father disagreed with Mother‟s suggestion that she was the most important person\nin Caleb‟s life. He acknowledged that Mother talks with Caleb thirty minutes a day via\nSkype but said that he is the one taking Caleb to do activities, bandaging skinned knees,\ngiving him baths, and putting him to bed at night. He found nothing “remotely true”\nabout her assertion that she was Caleb‟s emotional bedrock. Father testified that Caleb\nexperienced anxiety issues just prior to Mother‟s last visit to the United States, having a\nurinary urgency issue at school and at home. He said a specialist determined it was\nanxiety-related and prescribed medication, but the problem ended two to three days after\nMother returned to Australia.\n\n       Father was of the opinion that Mother‟s proposed parenting plan had many\nshortcomings. He explained that once travel time is considered, he would only have 55\ndays of parenting time with Caleb each year. He claimed that, to accomplish her plan, 16\ndays per year would be spent “in the air carting back and forth” between the United\nStates and Australia. Father also pointed out the travel costs that would be associated\nwith Mother‟s plan. Using Mother‟s estimation of $1,500 to $1,800 per ticket, and her\nproposal of four trips per year, Father calculated that he would incur between $18,000\nand $22,000 in flight expenses annually because of the fact that someone must\naccompany Caleb on the flights.2 Considering that Father would only get to see Caleb\nabout 55 days, Father testified that he would be required to pay roughly $400 a day to see\nCaleb.\n\n        On July 30, 2013, the trial court entered an order dismissing Mother‟s petition to\nmodify the parenting plan, finding there had been no material change in circumstance\nsince the previous hearing when the court found that Caleb had been raised by his parents\nand both sets of grandparents. The trial court denied Father‟s request for an award of\nattorney‟s fees. Mother timely filed a notice of appeal. On appeal to this Court, we\nconcluded that the trial court failed to make findings to specify the facts upon which the\ncourt based its determination that there had been no material change in circumstance and\nalso failed to specify the basis for its denial of Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees.\nKathryne B.F. v.

Mother filed a second notice of appeal.\n2\n Father testified that Mother wanted Caleb to fly alone, but Father insisted that he be accompanied. As a\nresult, the March 2012 permanent parenting plan required that Caleb be accompanied by a companion on\nflights.\n                                                     11\n\f                                             II. ISSUES PRESENTED\n\n        Mother presents the following issues for review on appeal:\n\n        1.       Whether the trial court erred in granting Father‟s motion to dismiss\n                 the petition to modify the parenting plan;\n\n        2.       Whether the trial court erred in not modifying the permanent\n                 parenting plan; and\n\n        3.       Whether Mother should be awarded attorney‟s fees on appeal.\n\nIn his posture as appellee, Father presents the following additional issues:\n\n        4.       Whether the trial court erred in denying Father‟s request for\n                 attorney‟s fees at trial; and\n\n        5.       Whether Father should be awarded attorney‟s fees on appeal.\n\nFor the following reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n\n                                      III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       “In a non-jury case such as this one, appellate courts review the trial court‟s\nfactual findings de novo upon the record, accompanied by a presumption of the\ncorrectness of the findings, unless the preponderance of the evidence is otherwise.” Kelly\nv.

However, the trial court held its ruling in abeyance in order to consider Father‟s proof prior to\nruling on the motion. A Rule 41.02(2) motion for involuntary dismissal challenges the sufficiency of the\nplaintiff‟s proof and requires the trial judge to “impartially weigh and evaluate the plaintiff‟s evidence\njust as it would after all the parties had concluded their cases” and determine “if the plaintiff has failed to\nmake out a prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence.” Burton v. Warren Farmers Co-op., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1068824\"><a href=\"/opinion/1068824/burton-v-warren-farmers-co-op/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 520-21 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2002). On appeal, this Court uses the familiar standard of Tennessee\nRule of Appellate Procedure 13(d) to review the trial court‟s disposition of the motion “because the trial\ncourt has used the same reasoning to dispose of the motion that it would have used to make a final\ndecision at the close of all the evidence.” Id. In this case, of course, the trial court did wait to make a\nfinal decision at the close of all the evidence. In any event, Rule 13(d) is clearly applicable.\n                                                      12\n\f        Appellate courts afford trial courts “considerable deference” when reviewing\nissues that hinge on witness credibility because trial courts are able “to observe the\ndemeanor and conduct of witnesses.” Kelly, 445 S.W.3d at 692. “Because decisions\nregarding parenting arrangements are factually driven and require careful consideration\nof numerous factors, trial judges, who have the opportunity to observe the witnesses and\nmake credibility determinations, are better positioned to evaluate the facts than appellate\njudges.” Id. (citing Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 693). “[C]ustody and visitation\ndeterminations often hinge on subtle factors, including the parents‟ demeanor and\ncredibility during . . . proceedings,” and we are reluctant to second-guess those decisions\non appeal.

DISCUSSION\n\n                              A. Mother’s Petition for Modification\n\n        A custody decision is considered res judicata as to the facts in existence when the\ndecision was made. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 698-99. “Res judicata is a rule of rest,\nwhich promotes finality, prevents inconsistent or contradictory judgments, conserves\njudicial resources, and protects litigants from the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits.”\nId. at 698 n.15 (internal quotations omitted). Simply put,\n\n       if either party, as often as he chose, could relitigate the question of custody\n       or support upon the same evidence and the same facts, great would be the\n       inconvenience to the litigants, the courts, and the public; and any trial of the\n       issues would be but an idle ceremony, since it would settle nothing.\n\n                                             13\n\fId. at 699 (quoting Hicks v.

Ct. App. 1943)). In order\nto balance the interests in finality and stability against the practical reality that changes\nmay occur after the initial custody decree which necessitate modification, courts have\nrequired a party seeking to modify a custody decision to first prove that a material change\nin circumstance has occurred since the prior decree. Id. (citing Ellis v. Carucci, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Nev.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">145</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (2007) (recognizing that the concept of material change in\ncircumstances derived from the doctrine of res judicata and was intended to prevent\nlitigants dissatisfied with custody decrees from filing immediate, repetitive, serial\nmotions in the hope of achieving a different result, based on essentially the same facts)).\nTennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-101(a)(2)(B) provides: 4\n\n        If the issue before the court is a modification of the court‟s prior decree\n        pertaining to custody, the petitioner must prove by a preponderance of the\n        evidence a material change in circumstance. A material change of\n        circumstance does not require a showing of a substantial risk of harm to the\n        child. A material change of circumstance may include, but is not limited to,\n        failures to adhere to the parenting plan or an order of custody and visitation\n        or circumstances that make the parenting plan no longer in the best interest\n        of the child.\n\n       In sum, when assessing a petition to modify a permanent parenting plan, the court\nmust first determine if a material change in circumstance has occurred and then engage in\na best interest analysis.

(quoting Aaby, 924\nS.W.2d at 627). “A trial court‟s determinations of whether a material change in\ncircumstances has occurred and whether modification of a parenting plan serves a child‟s\nbest interests are factual questions.” Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 692-93 (citing In re\nT.C.D., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1052094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1052094/in-re-tcd/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (Tenn.

Id. at 693.\n\n                                  1. Material Change in Circumstance\n\n4\n A different standard applies when a litigant seeks modification of a residential parenting schedule but not\nthe designation of primary residential parent. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-101(a)(2)(C). It is “easier to\nestablish that a material change in circumstances has occurred” when a party seeks to modify only the\nresidential parenting schedule. Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 703.\n                                                     14\n\f       Mother did not appeal from the trial court‟s order and March 1, 2012 permanent\nparenting plan initially naming Father as the child‟s primary residential parent and\ndenying Mother permission to relocate to Australia with the child. Accordingly, as\ndiscussed above, that order and parenting plan became res judicata on the subject of\ncustody and could only be modified on a showing of a material change in circumstance.5\nThe March 1, 2012 parenting plan provided that there would be “no regular day-to-day\nschedule as in the typical Parenting Plan Orders entered in this Court,” but generally,\nMother would be entitled to several long-term periods of parenting time with the child in\nAustralia and additional parenting time in Shelby County. The plan provided that when\nMother was visiting the United States, Caleb would have certain parenting time with\nFather “and his family” and “be made available to the [Father‟s] family.” Caleb was also\nscheduled to have overnight visits with the maternal grandparents two Saturday nights\nper month. Father was required to “provide for the child‟s care with either set of\ngrandparents as the primary option” and to notify Mother if he planned “to be absent\nfrom the child for more than three consecutive days.” Solely for “legal purposes,” the\nplan specified that Caleb was “scheduled to reside the majority of the time with [Father].”\nSix months before this parenting plan was entered, however, Mother received the email\nfrom the paternal grandmother containing the schedule they followed for Caleb‟s care\nafter she moved to Australia, whereby Caleb was scheduled to stay with either set of\ngrandparents on specified nights unless Father was off work.6\n5\n Both parties analyze this case as an ordinary petition to modify, requiring the demonstration of a material\nchange in circumstance and a best interest analysis. Even though changing custody would require Caleb\nto relocate to Australia, we agree with the parties‟ implicit conclusion, and that of the trial court, that the\nparental relocation statute is inapplicable to this particular proceeding. The parental relocation statute\nspeaks in terms of the relocation of a parent. See, e.g., Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-108(a) (“If a parent who\nis spending intervals of time with a child desires to relocate outside the state or more than fifty (50) miles\nfrom the other parent within the state, the relocating parent shall . . . .”). Because neither parent is\nproposing to relocate, the parental relocation statute does not apply.\n6\n As noted above, the trial court‟s June 8, 2011 written order denied Mother permission to relocate and\ndesignated Father as primary residential parent “subject to a Modified Permanent Parenting Plan.” The\ntrial judge directed the parties to either tender to the court a permanent parenting plan devised by consent\nor proposed parenting plans for consideration. After disputing various issues, the parties finally reached\nan agreement as to a permanent parenting plan, which was entered March 1, 2012. During the interim,\nthe parties operated under a June 21, 2011 “Order Regarding International Travel,” which allowed Mother\nto take Caleb to Australia for six weeks during the summer of 2011 but also directed the parties to\n“continue to consult with one another via the internet during this summer vacation to complete a Revised\nParenting Plan Order.” When determining whether a material change in circumstance has occurred, we\nmeasure from the prior final order of custody under which the parties are operating.

He also spent three out of four Saturday nights with his maternal\ngrandparents, and time on Wednesday evenings, as opposed to only the two Saturday\nnight visits per month provided in the parenting plan.

Keisling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1670173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1670173/keisling-v-keisling/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n718 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2005). “[R]elevant considerations include whether the change (1)\nhas occurred after the entry of the last order sought to be modified; (2) could not be\nreasonably anticipated at the time the last order was entered; and (3) is one that affects\nthe child in a meaningful way.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n       The trial court found that Mother failed to prove a material change in circumstance\n“that was not in existence or reasonably foreseeable” at the time of the March 1, 2012\nparenting plan. The court found that Caleb misses his Mother since she has moved to\nAustralia and that Mother has established a nice home there, but “[f]or these items, there\nwere no changes from the situation that existed at the 2011 trial or reasonably anticipated\nonce Mother moved to Australia.” The trial court also referenced the requirement in the\nparenting plan that Father use the grandparents as his first option for child care and found\nthat Father was complying with the parenting plan. Even so, however, we respectfully\ndisagree with the trial court‟s conclusion that a material change in circumstance has not\noccurred since the entry of the previous parenting plan. Even though the March 1, 2012\nparenting plan contemplated that Caleb would spend a substantial amount of time with\nboth sets of grandparents, the changes that actually occurred once Caleb began\nkindergarten were significant, material, and unanticipated, and they affected Caleb‟s\nwell-being in a meaningful way.\n\n                                             2. Best Interest\n\n       Our conclusion that a material change in circumstance has occurred answers only\nthe threshold question in this modification proceeding. “It does not predetermine the\noutcome of the case.” Armbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 705. Tennessee Code Annotated\nsection 36-6-106(a) provides that in any proceeding requiring the court to make a custody\ndetermination regarding a minor child, “the determination shall be made on the basis of\nthe best interest of the child.” The statute directs the courts to “order a custody\narrangement that permits both parents to enjoy the maximum participation possible in the\n\naction for absolute divorce . . . involving a minor child shall incorporate a permanent parenting plan[.]”)\nThus, we deem the June 8, 2011 order as non-final and measure from the date of the March 1, 2012\npermanent parenting plan.\n                                                     16\n\flife of the child consistent with the factors set out in this subsection (a), the location of\nthe residences of the parents, the child‟s need for stability and all other relevant factors.”\nId. After the trial court stated its finding that no material change in circumstance had\noccurred, the court recognized that it was unnecessary to address the best interest factors.\nHowever, the court went on discuss the best interest factors and state that if the court was\nrequired to reweigh the factors, it would find that “they weigh in favor of Father”\nremaining the primary residential parent. In addition, the trial court made numerous\nfactual findings earlier in its 26-page opinion that are relevant to the best interest factors,\nwhich are set forth below:7\n\n            (1) The strength, nature, and stability of the child’s relationship\n            with each parent, including whether one (1) parent has performed\n            the majority of parenting responsibilities relating to the daily needs\n            of the child;\n\n       The trial court found that Caleb loves both parents and is loved by both parents. It\nfound that Father has a stable relationship with Caleb but that Mother‟s relationship with\nCaleb was disrupted by her decision to move to Australia. The trial court acknowledged\nthat Caleb misses Mother but found that “[Mother] alone chose to act on her desire to\nmarry and move to Australia. She separated herself from Caleb and now wants to\nseparate him from the rest of his family with whom he has shared a very close\nrelationship all of his young life.”\n\n            (2) Each parent’s or caregiver’s past and potential for future\n            performance of parenting responsibilities, including the willingness\n            and ability of each of the parents and caregivers to facilitate and\n            encourage a close and continuing parent-child relationship between\n            the child and both of the child’s parents, consistent with the best\n\n7\n The trial court‟s order on remand, entered August 26, 2014, referenced the statutory best interest factors\nfound at Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-106(a). The statute was amended to include these\nparticular factors effective July 1, 2014. Prior to the amendment, the applicable statutory factors were\nfound at Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-404(b). “Even prior to the amendment, the analysis\nunder the two statutes was „quite similar.‟” Broadrick, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1947186</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 n.2 (quoting Armbrister,\n414 S.W.3d at 697) (noting “significant overlap” and “little substantive difference” between the two\nsections prior to the amendment). The amendment was simply meant to “alleviate inconsistency and\nconfusion” caused by different statutes containing factors pertaining to judicial review of custodial\narrangements and the establishment of residential schedules that “differ[ed] slightly in their specifics.”\nMuhonen v. Muhonen, No. E2013-02601-COA-R3-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">740667</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *11 n.5 (Tenn. Ct. App.\nFeb. 20, 2015) (no perm. app. filed). The issues in this case do not require us to reconcile any differences\nin the statutes, so we will discuss the factors analyzed by the trial court for clarity. The statutory factors\nthat are not listed in our discussion were either found inapplicable or equally applicable to both parties\nand did not impact the court‟s analysis.\n                                                      17\n\f           interest of the child. . . . ;\n\n       The trial judge stated in her written order that she had taken notice “of how each\nparent encouraged or discouraged Caleb‟s relationship with the other.” The court noted\nthat Father allowed Mother additional time with Caleb before she left for Australia and\nafter she made the move in order to help Caleb with the transition. In addition, he\npermitted Caleb to participate in Skype sessions with Mother every day. The court also\nnoted that Father allowed Caleb to continue spending time with his maternal\ngrandparents, as he had done in the past. It concluded that Father had “gone to great\nlengths to assure that Mother, and both sets of grandparents, who have been closely\ninvolved with Caleb all of his life, are still a big part of his daily life.”\n\n        On the other hand, the court found that when Caleb is with Mother, “she makes\nlittle effort to direct him toward maintaining contact with his Father and grandparents.”\nFor example, when Caleb is with Mother in Australia, he does not Skype with Father\nevery day, she does not encourage him to talk to Father if he does not want to do so, and\nshe does not encourage Caleb to open his mail. The court found that this conduct\ndamaged Caleb‟s bond with the family members who wrote to him.\n\n           (5) The degree to which a parent has been the primary caregiver,\n        defined as the parent who has taken the greater responsibility for\n        performing parental responsibilities;\n\n        The court noted that Father had been Caleb‟s primary residential parent since\n2011.\n\n            (9) The child’s interaction and interrelationships with siblings,\n        other relatives and step-relatives, and mentors, as well as the child’s\n        involvement with the child’s physical surroundings, school, or other\n        significant activities;\n\n       After reviewing photographs of Caleb in Australia, the court concluded that Caleb\nhas been “enjoying a grand adventure on two continents.” The court noted that Shannon\nhad become involved with Caleb and taught him to swim and ski, and Mother‟s marriage\nto Shannon had been stable for two years. The court noted that when Shannon was asked\nquestions about Caleb‟s friends in Australia, his school work, and his music lessons,\nShannon “seemed to have little information.” Still, the court found that its analysis of\nthis factor was somewhat more favorable to Mother than it had been at the time of the\nrelocation trial, when Mother was recently married to someone she had only dated for a\nfew weeks. The court also mentioned that Mother involved Caleb in the Anglican\nChurch in Australia and that they regularly socialize with other church members. In\n                                            18\n\faddition, the court considered that Caleb had visited Shannon‟s mother and father,\nalthough they lived several hours away from Mother‟s home in Australia. Overall, the\ncourt found that Caleb‟s “personal social circle” is smaller in Australia.\n\n       With regard to Caleb‟s interactions in Memphis, the court noted that Caleb‟s\ngrandparents participate in his day to day life. Although Mother testified that Caleb‟s\nrelationship with his grandparents could continue if he moved to Australia, the court\nrecognized the testimony of Mother‟s father that he and his wife are unlikely to visit\nAustralia due to financial constraints. The court found that Mother‟s expectation that\nFather and the grandparents could travel to Australia to visit Caleb was “impractical due\nto finances, age and distance.” In addition, the court recognized that Caleb had\n“substantially less contact” with both sets of grandparents during his visits to Australia,\nand he received mail in Australia that was never opened. The court concluded that\nMother “apparently makes no effort to direct the child to open all of his mail.”\n\n       As for Caleb‟s activities in Memphis, the court found that he is excelling and “at\nthe top of his class” in elementary school, participating in the CLUE program for gifted\nstudents, and active in the children‟s choir at the church of the maternal grandparents.\nThe court found that Caleb has a large group of friends in Memphis. The court\nconcluded that Caleb “is well adjusted and flourishing” under the current parenting plan.\nThe trial court found that these considerations had “shifted further in Father[‟s] favor”\nsince the relocation trial and that Caleb had “deeper ties with the Memphis community.”\nIt found that Caleb is “doing splendidly in school and would be harmed by being moved\naway” from his community, grandparents, and Father.\n\n           (10) The importance of continuity in the child’s life and the length\n       of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment;\n\n      Regarding this factor, the court noted that Caleb had been in the care of Father\nsince 2011, and he had “spent his entire life visiting regularly with his two sets of\ngrandparents.”\n\n          (14) Each parent’s employment schedule, and the court may make\n       accommodations consistent with those schedules;\n\n        The trial court found that Father works roughly 45 hours per week, in shifts\nstarting as early as 7:30 a.m. and ending as late as 10:30 p.m. The trial court noted that\nFather had already been transferred to a smaller store to enable him to work better hours\nthan he had in the past.\n\n       The trial court acknowledged Mother‟s assertion that a primary residential parent\n                                            19\n\fshould be able to meet all of the child‟s needs and be with him around the clock.\nHowever, the court noted that Mother is now employed Monday through Friday from 9\na.m. to 5 p.m. and “will not be available to take care of Caleb around the clock either.”\nWhen Mother and Shannon are working, Caleb would be in the care of unrelated persons\nrather than grandparents.\n\n       In addition, the trial court rejected Mother‟s argument that Father is “not really\nraising Caleb.” The court found that Father testified “without contradiction, that he is\nwith Caleb every day.” The court found that Father “provided stability for Caleb” by\nallowing him to get “a full night of sleep” at the paternal grandparents‟ house on school\nnights. The trial court recognized the alternative of Caleb going to sleep in one location\nand being awakened and moved after Father‟s late work shift. The court found that under\nthe current schedule:\n\n       Father goes to his mother‟s home to be with Caleb in the evenings if he is\n       not working, stays with the child, gives him his bath and puts him to bed.\n       He doesn‟t leave until Caleb is asleep. When Father works an early shift,\n       his mother gets Caleb up, fed and to school. When Father works a late shift,\n       he comes back to his mother‟s to get Caleb up and take him to school. On\n       other days, Father goes to Caleb‟s school to have lunch with his son. Yes,\n       this is an inventive pattern but it works for Caleb.\n\nIn sum, the trial court concluded that “[w]hether Father parents Caleb in his home or in\nhis Mother‟s home is a distinction without a difference. He is parenting his child when he\nis not working.” With the exception of one trip to Thailand, the trial court found “no\nproof” that Father was spending his time away from work with anyone but Caleb. The\ncourt found that Father “does not spend time dating or with his friends or doing activities\nthat are inappropriate for his son.” The court also noted Father‟s active involvement with\nCaleb‟s school. The trial court found that “Father is involved with the child every day of\nhis life even though Caleb sleeps each school night at his Paternal grandparent‟s home.”\n\n          (15) Any other factors deemed relevant by the court.\n\n      The trial court also noted that Father informed Mother about Caleb‟s weeknight\nschedule for kindergarten prior to implementing the schedule, and rather than\ncomplaining, Mother “replied the next day saying it was good for him to have this\nschedule” and “indicated approval” for Caleb‟s unusual schedule.\n\n        The trial court acknowledged Mother‟s testimony that Caleb misses her but found\nthis to be “the natural consequence of her decision to move to Australia.” The court also\nrecognized that if it designated Mother as primary residential parent and allowed her to\n                                            20\n\frelocate Caleb to Australia, “it is anticipated that he will miss his Father with whom he\nhas daily contact, as well as his paternal grandparents and his maternal grandparents with\nwhom he has nearly daily contact also.” The court concluded that Caleb currently misses\none person, Mother, but he has daily Skype contact with her as well as lengthy periods of\nparenting time in Canberra and in Memphis. However, if Caleb moved to Australia, he\nwould then miss five “people who are significant to him,” and he would be unlikely to\nhave the same level of contact with them that he presently enjoys with Mother because\nthey would be unable to travel as Caleb and Mother do. Considering all of the\ncircumstances and relevant best interest factors, the trial court concluded that “Caleb is\nthriving in Memphis” and determined that “[i]t is in Caleb‟s best interest to continue his\nlife as it has been over the last two years.”\n\n        The evidence does not preponderate against the trial court‟s finding that it is in\nCaleb‟s best interest for Father to continue to be designated as primary residential parent\nrather than moving Caleb to Australia to live with Mother. When determining the best\ninterest of a child, we must consider the concept from the child‟s perspective rather than\nthe parent‟s. White v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1054843\"><a href=\"/opinion/1054843/white-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2004). The statute\nexplicitly requires consideration of “the location of the residences of the parents,” see\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-106(a), and the trial court found that Mother was proposing to\nmove Caleb “to the other side of the planet.” This would render it extremely difficult, if\nnot impossible, for Father and Caleb‟s grandparents to visit him. Moreover, the distance\nbecomes more significant considering the trial court‟s finding that Mother “makes little\neffort to direct [Caleb] toward maintaining contact with his Father and grandparents.”\nFather, on the other hand, goes to “great lengths” to facilitate Caleb‟s relationship with\nMother and with both sets of grandparents. Considering the fact that Mother does not get\nhome from work until 5:30 p.m., she acknowledged the possibility that she would send\nCaleb to summer camp or enroll him in an after-school program if he moved to Australia.\nHe currently goes to bed at 7:30 p.m. In Australia, Caleb does not have family members\nliving nearby who would be available to care for him. We believe it particularly\nsignificant that Caleb is flourishing under the current parenting plan. His participation in\nthe CLUE program and his literacy testing indicate that the current arrangement is\nworking well for Caleb. He is also involved in his church choir, taking violin lessons,\nand regularly participating in activities with a group of friends and classmates.\n\n       Mother‟s only real complaint appears to be the extent of participation by Caleb‟s\npaternal grandparents. She claims that they are raising Caleb rather than Father. At the\noutset, we note that Caleb‟s significant contact with his grandparents is not a new\nphenomenon. At the close of the 2011 relocation trial, prior to Mother‟s move, the trial\ncourt found that Caleb had “been raised by his Mother, his Father, his maternal\ngrandparents and his paternal grandparents,” pursuant to “a nearly ideal co-parenting\nrelationship that included both sets of grandparents and nearly seamless transition from\n                                            21\n\fone home to the other.” Once Mother chose to remove herself from that equation by\nmoving to Australia, Father and the two sets of grandparents were left to pick up the\nslack. Although we agree with the trial court‟s observation that Caleb‟s current schedule\nis unusual and inventive, we also agree with its finding that the schedule “works for\nCaleb.”8 We also agree that Father is in fact parenting Caleb, and he has not abandoned\nhis role as primary residential parent, as Mother alleges.\n\n        At trial, Father conceded that Caleb does not live with him “24/7” but added that\n“[Caleb] sees me almost every time that he‟s awake when he‟s not in school or\nsometimes when he is in school.” Again, Father and the paternal grandparents live\napproximately one mile apart. Father testified that he and Caleb spend time at the\npaternal grandparents‟ house six to seven days a week. When he works the opening shift,\nhe spends the afternoon and evening with Caleb and stays at the paternal grandparents‟\nhouse until after Caleb is asleep. When Father works the mid-day shift, he wakes Caleb\nand takes Caleb to school, then returns in time to have dinner with him and put him to\nbed, leaving after Caleb falls asleep. When Father works the closing shift, he wakes\nCaleb and takes him to school and generally visits him at school for lunch or other\nactivities. Father suggested that it was inappropriate to characterize Caleb‟s time with\nFather and his time with the paternal grandparents “as an either/or proposition” because\n“that would be a fallacy.” He claimed that when Caleb is “with” the paternal\ngrandparents, “more often than not, he is with me. In other words, there‟s significant\noverlap between the two.” He claimed that Caleb was not really spending time with his\ngrandparents as opposed to time with Father because they were generally doing things\ntogether as a family. The evidence supports the trial court‟s finding that Father sees\nCaleb every day and is parenting Caleb despite the fact that Caleb sleeps at the paternal\ngrandparents‟ house. The fact that Father sleeps at his condo one mile away does not\nalter our conclusion as to Caleb‟s best interest. Father is there to wake Caleb in the\nmornings and put him to bed at night, except when he is working. He is deeply involved\nwith Caleb‟s school and attends all of his doctor‟s appointments. Also, as Father testified\nat trial, he makes the ultimate decision with regard to Caleb‟s schedule, not the\ngrandparents. When Father informed Mother of his plan before Caleb entered\nkindergarten, she did not complain but said she thought it was “a good idea,” never\n8\n “[W]hile virtually all divorced parents must work outside the home, and some parents must work\natypical hours, it is not punishment to the parent to consider the effect of [the] work schedule on\nthe child. Rather, it is the court‟s job to ensure that the everyday quality of the child‟s life is not\nsacrificed to meet the parents‟ needs or desires. Consideration of how „child-friendly‟ each\nparent‟s schedule must necessarily be part of that determination.” Wall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2732269</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at\n*28. However, “the fact that the custodial parent has an atypical work schedule, in and of itself,\nshould not necessitate a change in the designation of primary residential parent, if the other\nfactors do not weigh in favor of such a change.” Id. at *27. In this case, the evidence does not\npreponderate against the trial court‟s finding that it is in Caleb‟s best interest to remain in the\nUnited States with Father in spite of his atypical work schedule and child care arrangement.\n                                                       22\n\findicating any disapproval of the arrangement until she filed her petition to modify\nmonths later.\n\n       On appeal, Mother argues that the trial court failed to address her superior parental\nrights as a parent and therefore violated her constitutional rights. She acknowledges that\nthe parties to this action are both biological parents but claims that this case nevertheless\nhas “a factor of superior parental rights to it.” “In custody disputes between parents and\nnon-parents, the comparative fitness analysis cannot be used because it fails to take into\naccount that the custody claims of biological parents and the custody claims of third\nparties do not have the same legal weight.” In re B.C.W., No. M2007-00168-COA-R3-\nJV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">450616</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Tenn.

Ct. App. Aug. 22, 2007). This case, however, involves a contest\nbetween Mother and Father, and Father was awarded custody of Caleb. This case does\nnot involve a custody contest between a parent and a non-parent. Therefore, the superior\nparental rights doctrine is inapplicable.\n\n       Mother also argues that Father fails to meet the definition of a “primary residential\nparent” under Tennessee law. She notes that Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-6-\n402 provides, “As used in this part, unless the context requires otherwise,” a “[p]rimary\nresidential parent means the parent with whom the child resides more than fifty percent\n(50%) of the time.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(4). A “[p]ermanent parenting plan” is\ndescribed as “a written plan for the parenting and best interests of the child, including the\nallocation of parenting responsibilities and the establishment of a residential schedule[.]”\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402(3). The statute defines a “[r]esidential schedule” as “the\nschedule of when the child is in each parent‟s physical care” and provides that a\nresidential schedule “shall designate in which parent‟s home each minor child shall reside\non given days of the year, including provisions for holidays, birthdays of family\nmembers, vacations, and other special occasions, consistent with the criteria of this part.”\nTenn.

In fact, the\npermanent parenting plan stated, “Due to the fact the Mother and Step-Father currently\nreside in Australia, there shall be no regular day-to-day schedule as in the typical\nParenting Plan Orders entered in this Court.” Notably, the statute also provides the\nfollowing definition of “[p]arenting responsibilities”:\n\n             (2) “Parenting responsibilities” means those aspects of the parent-\n      child relationship in which the parent makes decisions and performs duties\n      necessary for the care and growth of the child. “Parenting responsibilities,”\n      the establishment of which is the objective of a permanent parenting plan,\n      include:\n                     (A) Providing for the child‟s emotional care and\n             stability, including maintaining a loving, stable, consistent,\n             and nurturing relationship with the child and supervising the\n             child to encourage and protect emotional, intellectual, moral,\n             and spiritual development;\n                     (B) Providing for the child‟s physical care, including\n             attending to the daily needs of the child, such as feeding,\n             clothing, physical care, and grooming, supervision, health\n             care, and day care, and engaging in other activities that are\n             appropriate to the developmental level of the child and that\n             are within the social and economic circumstances of the\n             particular family;\n                     (C) Providing encouragement and protection of the\n             child‟s intellectual and moral development, including\n             attending to adequate education for the child, including\n             remedial or other education essential to the best interests of\n             the child;\n                     (D) Assisting the child in developing and maintaining\n             appropriate interpersonal relationships;\n                     (E) Exercising appropriate judgment regarding the\n             child‟s welfare, consistent with the child‟s developmental\n             level and the family‟s social and economic circumstances;\n             and\n                     (F) Providing any financial security and support of the\n             child in addition to child support obligations[.]\n\nTenn. Code Ann. § 36-6-402. Even though Caleb sleeps at the home of the paternal\ngrandparents on school nights, Father is fulfilling all of the aforementioned parenting\nresponsibilities. Our consideration of the aforementioned definitions does not alter the\noutcome in this case.\n                                           24\n\f        After reviewing the trial court‟s thorough and clearly articulated findings, we find\nno evidence that the court applied an incorrect legal standard, reached an illogical\nconclusion, or based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. See\nKelly, 445 S.W.3d at 696. “Appellate courts should reverse custody decisions „only\nwhen the trial court‟s ruling falls outside the spectrum of rulings that might reasonably\nresult from an application of the correct legal standards to the evidence.‟” Id. (quoting\nArmbrister, 414 S.W.3d at 693). Here, the trial court applied the proper legal standards,\nand its custody ruling falls well within the spectrum of possible reasonable results.\nAffording the trial court the deference it deserves in ascribing credibility and weight to\nthe witnesses‟ testimony, see id., we find no basis to overturn the trial court‟s designation\nof Father as Caleb‟s primary residential parent.\n\n                                   B.   Attorney’s Fees\n\n       Finally, Father argues that the trial court erred by declining to award him the\nattorney‟s fees he incurred in connection with defending against the petition to modify.\nBoth Mother and Father request an award of attorney‟s fees incurred on appeal. In the\nprevious appeal of this matter, we considered Father‟s argument that the trial court erred\nin denying his request for attorney‟s fees but stated:\n\n       In its order [of] June 8, 2011, the trial court simply states that Father‟s\n       request for attorney‟s fees is denied, and provides no explanation for its\n       decision. Again, the lack of explanation in the court‟s order stymies our\n       ability to review the court‟s decision for an abuse of discretion.\n       Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the order denying Father‟s\n       attorney‟s fees and remand for specific findings concerning the trial court‟s\n       reasons for the denial of Father‟s request.\n\nKathryne B.F., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">992110</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8. On remand, the trial court entered a lengthy\norder providing the reasons for its decisions on the parenting issues, but the order failed\nto address the issue of attorney‟s fees. The order simply stated that “all motions and\npetitions heretofore filed, but not specifically addressed, are denied.”\n\n        Apparently, neither party directed the trial court‟s attention to the issue of\nattorney‟s fees on remand. After the trial court entered its order on remand with no\nmention of the issue, either party could have filed a post-trial motion noting the trial\ncourt‟s omission in order to avoid the potential for an additional remand and prolonged\nlitigation. See In re Noah J., No. W2014-01778-COA-R3-JV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1332665</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5\nn.5 (Tenn. Ct. App. Mar. 23, 2015) (no perm. app. filed) (“In order to save time and\nmoney, parties who receive an order that fails to comply with Rule 52.01 have the option\n                                             25\n\fof seeking correction of that deficiency in the trial court by filing a motion under Rule\n52.02 „to amend or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of the\njudgment would be required if the motion is granted.‟”) (quoting Tenn. R. Civ. P. 59.01).\nAs it is, we are left with a bare denial of Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees with no\nexplanation of the trial court‟s reasoning in either of its written orders. Nevertheless, in\nthe interest of justice and economy, in order to avoid a second remand, before a different\ntrial judge,10 we have reviewed the original trial judge‟s oral remarks and the entire\nrecord in order to address the issue of attorney‟s fees. At the conclusion of the original\nhearing on the petition to modify, after the trial judge announced her decision to dismiss\nMother‟s petition, Father‟s counsel pointed out his prayer for attorney‟s fees and asked if\nthe trial court would permit him to file an affidavit of attorney‟s fees at a later date and\nset the matter for hearing. The trial judge simply responded, “I don‟t believe I would\naward attorney fees this time.” She added, however, that she would be “more inclined”\nto award attorney‟s fees in the future if Mother continued to file repeated petitions to\nmodify with “as little proof” as she presented in support of this petition.\n\n           Tennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c) provides:\n           (c) The plaintiff spouse may recover from the defendant spouse, and the\n           spouse or other person to whom the custody of the child, or children, is\n           awarded may recover from the other spouse reasonable attorney fees\n           incurred in enforcing any decree for alimony and/or child support, or in\n           regard to any suit or action concerning the adjudication of the custody or\n           the change of custody of any child, or children, of the parties, both upon the\n           original divorce hearing and at any subsequent hearing, which fees may be\n           fixed and allowed by the court, before whom such action or proceeding is\n           pending, in the discretion of such court.\n\n“„[I]n cases involving the custody and support of children, . . . it has long been the rule in\nthis State that counsel fees incurred on behalf of minors may be recovered when shown to\nbe reasonable and appropriate.‟” Taylor v.

The trial judge‟s oral remarks indicate only that she was\nnot inclined to award attorney‟s fees “this time.” However, the Tennessee Supreme\nCourt has stated that “„[d]iscretionary choices are not left to a court‟s inclination, but to\nits judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.‟” State v. Lewis,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1441546\"><a href=\"/opinion/1441546/state-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (Tenn. 2007) (quoting Martha S. Davis, Standards of Review:\nJudicial Review of Discretionary Decisionmaking, 2 J. App. Prac. & Process 47, 58\n(2000)). Thus, an abuse of discretion will be found “when the trial court . . . fails to\nproperly consider the factors on that issue given by the higher courts to guide the\ndiscretionary determination.” Id.; see also Gonsewski, 350 S.W.3d at 105 (“An abuse of\ndiscretion occurs when the trial court causes an injustice by applying an incorrect legal\nstandard[.]”).\n\n         Having reviewed the entire record, however, we likewise conclude that Father\nshould not be awarded his attorney‟s fees at the trial level. We recognize that Mother\nfiled her petition to modify within a year of the entry of the March 1, 2012 permanent\nparenting plan entered as a result of the relocation trial. We also note that Mother does\nnot pay child support for the child to assist Father with the cost of raising him. However,\nFather does not cite to any information in the record regarding his ability to pay\nattorney‟s fees, and we are not aware of any. The “ability to pay should not be the\ncontrolling consideration with regard to awards for legal expenses in custody or support\nproceedings,” but it “is certainly a factor to be considered.” Sherrod, 849 S.W.2d at 785.\nCourts may award attorney‟s fees without proof that the requesting party is unable to pay\nthem as long as the award is just and equitable under the facts of the case. Id. Although\nMother did not prevail at the trial court level, her allegations were not totally\nunwarranted, as we have determined that she did successfully demonstrate a material\nchange in circumstances. The record contains no information regarding the amount of\nattorney‟s fees incurred by either party. Considering all of the circumstances in this case\nand the scarce financial evidence pertaining to the issue of attorney‟s fees, we conclude\nthat it is just and equitable to require both parties to pay the attorney‟s fees they incurred\nat the trial level.\n\n       As noted above, both parties seek an award of attorney‟s fees on appeal.\nTennessee Code Annotated section 36-5-103(c) also applies to awards of attorney‟s fees\nincurred on appeal and vests in this Court the discretionary authority to award fees and\ncosts in proper cases.

As for Father‟s\nrequest, we note that he was, overall, successful in defending against Mother‟s petition to\nmodify. However, we found merit in one issue raised by Mother -- regarding the\nexistence of a material change in circumstance. Again, we have no information in the\nrecord regarding Father‟s ability or inability to pay his attorney‟s fees. Exercising our\ndiscretion in this case, we respectfully deny Father‟s request for attorney‟s fees on\nappeal.\n\n                                    V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the circuit court is hereby affirmed\nin part and reversed in part.
