On May 29, 1990, the district court dismissed Carson's claims for deprivation of property, denial of adequate exercise and retaliatory transfer.

Roper asserted that Carson was \"unmanageable\" because he was constantly swearing and making gestures at the prison staff.  Roper further asserted that Carson's behavior violated jail rules which prohibit the use of obscene or threatening language and gestures and that his conduct undermined the staff's security.  Finally, Roper asserted that defendants did not retaliate against Carson and that no disciplinary proceedings were brought against Carson due to the short-term nature of Carson's reassignments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In opposition to the defendants' summary judgment motion, Carson submitted his own affidavit asserting that after a discussion with defendants about his lack of library access, defendants became agitated and moments later transferred him to administrative segregation.
