Compl., Mar. 3,\n\n2002, ECF No. 1. When State hired Shea in 1992, State operated an affirmative action program\n\nthat made qualified minorities eligible for direct placement into mid-level classes of the Foreign\n\nService. Shea claims he would have been eligible for this mid-level placement program but for\n\nhis race and still feels the effect of his entry at a lower pay grade—each paycheck is less than it\n\nwould have been if he entered as a mid-level officer.\n\n         This case suffered a series of fits and starts, largely attributable to Ledbetter v. Goodyear\n\nTire & Rubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007) and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Pub. L. No. 111–2\n\n(Jan. 29, 2009). Since Shea based his claim on the continuing effects of a discriminatory\n\ndecision made in 1992, his claim was time-barred until passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The\n\nsubstantive merits are finally ripe for consideration as the Court considers each party’s motion\n\n1\n On February 1, 2013, John F. Kerry succeeded Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State. Since this\nsuit is against the Secretary of State in his or her official capacity only, the Court will substitute Secretary Kerry as\ndefendant in this matter, per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d).\n\ffor summary judgment. Under Title VII, Shea has the ultimate burden of proving that State’s\n\naffirmative action plan was unlawful. Shea cannot support an essential element of his claim with\n\nadmissible evidence. He tries to prove, via his own amateur statistics, that minorities were not\n\nsignificantly underrepresented in the Foreign Service mid-levels.         Shea needs, and lacks,\n\nqualified testimony about the statistical significance of his findings. Therefore, State is entitled\n\nto summary judgment on Shea’s remaining claims and this case will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       In 1985, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986\n\nand 1987 (“1986–87 FRAA”).           Pub. L. 99–93.      The 1986–87 FRAA directed State to\n\n“develop…a plan designed to increase significantly the number of members of minority groups\n\nand women in the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 99-93, Title I, § 152(a). Congress further directed\n\nthat “each plan developed pursuant this section shall…place particular emphasis in achieving\n\nsignificant increases in the numbers of minority group members and women who are in the mid-\n\nlevels of the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 99-93, Title I, § 152(b). Thereafter, State instituted the\n\nMid-Level Affirmative Action Plan (“MLAAP”) under its more general Mid-Level Foreign\n\nService Career Candidate Program (“MLCCP”). See Def.’s Statement of Facts Not in Genuine\n\nDispute ¶ 3 (“Def.’s SMF”), Aug. 17, 2012, ECF No. 120-1; Pl.’s Response to Def.’s Statement\n\nof Material Facts Not in Dispute 7–8 (“Pl.’s SMF Resp.”), Aug. 30, 2012, ECF No. 123-4 (only\n\nobjecting to defendant’s statement that MLAAP was “in response” to FRAA). Although white\n\nwomen were not qualified to participate in the MLAAP, State created the “Federal Women\n\nPrograms” and the Federal Women’s Program manager to develop and monitor programs aimed\n\nat greater female representation. Def.’s SMF ¶ 4; Pl.’s SMF Resp. (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 4).\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       In 1987, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988\n\nand 1989 (“1988–89 FRAA”). Pub. L. 100–204. In the 1988–89 FRAA Congress found:\n\n       [T]hat the Department of State and other Foreign Service agencies have not been\n       successful in their efforts – (1) to recruit and retain members of minority groups\n       in order to increase significantly the numbers of minority groups in the Foreign\n       Service; and (2) to provide adequate career advancement for women and members\n       of minority groups in the senior levels of the Foreign Service.\n\nPub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(a). Congress further required State to “substantially increase\n\ntheir efforts to implement effectively the plans required by” the 1986–87 FRAA and “ensure that\n\nthose plans effectively address the need to promote increased numbers of qualified women and\n\nmembers of minority groups into the senior levels of the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 100–204,\n\nTitle I, § 183(b). State revised the MLAAP in November 1990 and instituted its FY 1990–92\n\nMid-Level Affirmative Action Plan, which was in effect when Shea applied to, and was hired by,\n\nState. Def.’s SMF ¶ 9; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 9).\n\n       Mid-level hiring allowed State to hire a Foreign Service candidate directly into a higher\n\ngrade, rather than into an entry-level grade. Under the general mid-level hiring program, a\n\ncandidate with the requisite experience could enter as a mid-level hire if State received a\n\n“certification of need” that State required an outside hire at that grade and with those\n\nqualifications. The Mid-Level Affirmative Action Plan dispensed with the “certification of\n\nneed” requirement in favor of self-identification as American Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian and\n\nPacific Islander, Hispanic, or African American. State required all candidates for mid-level\n\nhiring—both minority and non-minority—to (a) have substantial professional experience, (b)\n\nreceive a passing grade on an oral examination, and (c) pass a background check. In February\n\n1993, State ended the mid-level affirmative action program, but kept in place its more general\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fmid-level hiring program. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–11 (admitting in all\n\nrelevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17).\n\n        In September 1990, William Shea—a white male of Irish descent—submitted an\n\napplication to the Foreign Service. Shea never applied for mid-level placement through the\n\ngeneral Mid-Level Foreign Service Career Candidate Program. In May 1993, State hired Shea as\n\nan entry-level career Foreign Service Officer; he came in at grade FS-05, step 5. 2 Shea knew at\n\nthe time he was hired that qualified minorities could start at higher grades, and that two people in\n\nhis introductory class were starting at mid-level grades due to their participation in a minority\n\nmid-level hiring program. Shea did not file an administrative grievance until July 11, 2001—\n\nnine years after he entered the Foreign Service. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 20–23, 26, 37; Pl.’s SMF Resp.\n\n13–16 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 20–23, 26, 37).\n\n        In his Complaint, Shea alleged that he would have passed the screening process of the\n\nMLAAP, but was excluded from consideration solely because of his race. Specifically, Shea\n\nalleged harm because his hiring at entry-level rather than mid-level grade has subjected him to\n\nlower pay and fewer promotion opportunities than members of minority groups admitted under\n\nthe MLAAP, in violation of his rights under Title VII. See Compl. ¶¶ 1–2.\n\n        B.       Procedural Background\n\n        On July 11, 2001, Shea filed a grievance with the State Department asserting, among\n\nother things, racial discrimination in violation of Title VII because of the disparate pay he was\n\nreceiving. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 37; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 11 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 37); Compl. ¶¶ 1–\n\n2. On January 30, 2002, Shea received the decision of the Foreign Service Grievance Board\n\ndismissing Shea’s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.                 Compl. ¶ 2.        Having exhausted his\n\n\n2\n In the Foreign Service personnel system, FS-05 is the entry-level grade and FS-01 is the senior grade. See Def.’s\nSMF ¶ 11; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 11).\n\n                                                         4\n\fadministrative remedies, Shea filed suit in this Court on March 26, 2002. His Complaint raised a\n\nTitle VII challenge to the MLAAP, claiming he was injured by continuing to receive a lower\n\npaycheck than he would had he been eligible for mid-level placement though the MLAAP.\n\n       The case was initially assigned to Judge James Robertson, who granted State’s Motion to\n\nDismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because Shea’s complaint and\n\nadministrative grievance were untimely. Mem. & Order, Sept. 30, 2003, ECF Nos. 15 & 16. He\n\nfound Shea’s “complaint amounted to no more than allegations of discrimination in May 1992,\n\nwhen he started at a lower pay grade.” Mem. 4, ECF No. 16. Judge Robertson held that each\n\nallegedly-diminished paycheck did not amount to a new, discrete discriminatory act that reset the\n\nclock for filing an administrative complaint. Id. at 3–4. Shea tried to rely on Anderson v.\n\nZubieta, 180 F.3d 329 (D.C. Cir. 1999) and Bazemore v. Friday 478 U.S. 385 (1986) “for the\n\nproposition that, every time he received a paycheck for less than it would have been had he not\n\nbeen discriminated against, he was ‘discriminated against anew.’” Id. at 4. However, Judge\n\nRobertson found that these cases were “inapposite,” because there was not a “‘discriminatory\n\nsystem in place,’” akin to those in Bazemore and Anderson. Id. (quoting Neidermeier v. Office of\n\nBaucus, 153 F. Supp. 2d 23, 29 (D.D.C. 2001)). Furthermore, Judge Robertson dismissed Shea’s\n\nconstitutional claims and his request for declaratory and injunctive relief. Id. at 4–5.\n\n       Shea then appealed the district court’s ruling. See Notice of Appeal, Nov. 11, 2003, ECF\n\nNo. 17. “While the district court dismissed all of his allegations on the pleadings—finding none\n\nstated a viable claim—Shea [sought] review of only one: i.e., that his pay and benefits are\n\ndiscriminatorily low because the State Department set his pay grade pursuant to a diversity\n\nprogram that disadvantaged him on account of his race (white) and ethnicity (Irish), in violation\n\nof Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq., and the Equal Protection\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fcomponent of the Fifth Amendment, U.S. CONST. amend V.” Shea v. Rice, 409 F.3d 448, 449\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2005). The court of appeals found that “Bazemore holds that an employee may\n\nrecover for discriminatorily low pay received within the limitations period because each\n\npaycheck constitutes a discrete discriminatory act,” id. at 455, reversed the district court’s\n\ndismissal, and remanded for further proceedings, id. at 456.\n\n       While the case was on remand, the Supreme Court decided Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire &\n\nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007) and brought the D.C. Circuit’s analysis into doubt. Judge\n\nRobertson denied State’s subsequent Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings, but\n\ninvited the parties to file for summary judgment after a fuller development of the factual record.\n\nSee Order, Aug. 30, 2007, ECF No. 43. After the parties filed cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, Judge Robertson found that Ledbetter effectively overturned the D.C. Circuit’s prior\n\nanalysis. Shea v. Rice, 587 F. Supp. 2d 166, 168–69 (D.D.C. 2008). He stated that Shea’s\n\nargument “cannot be successfully distinguished from the ‘paycheck accrual rule’ that Ledbetter\n\nargued for and that the Supreme Court rejected.” Id. at 169.     Bazemore could not save Shea\n\nbecause State did not engage in any “fresh discrimination” or continue a discriminatory system\n\nduring the limitations period; it was undisputed that State ended its mid-level affirmative action\n\nprogram in 1993. Id. at 169–70. Therefore, Judge Robertson granted State summary judgment.\n\n       Shea again appealed the dismissal of his case. See Notice of Appeal, Nov. 23, 2008, ECF\n\nNo. 65. While Shea’s appeal was pending, Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of\n\n2009, Pub. L. No. 111–2, 123 Stat. 5 (2009), which abrogated the Supreme Court’s holding in\n\nLedbetter. The D.C. Circuit remanded for reconsideration in light of this intervening change.\n\nShea v. Clinton, No. 08–5491, 2009 WL 1153448, at *1 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 2, 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f       On remand, Judge Robertson reconsidered the parties’ summary judgment motions,\n\nexamining arguments he did not reach earlier because he had disposed of the case on other\n\ngrounds. Mem. Order, Aug. 11, 2009, ECF No. 69. He rejected State’s legislative immunity\n\ndefense and found State did not have enough evidence to support a laches defense. Id. at 3–5.\n\nHe then considered Shea’s Title VII challenge to the MLAAP. He applied the burden-shifting\n\nframework of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and considered Shea’s\n\nclaims under the affirmative action jurisprudence of United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193\n\n(1979), Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County, Cal., 480 U.S. 616 (1987), and\n\nHammon v. Barry, 826 F.2d 73 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Id. at 6–7. Judge Robertson stated that:\n\n       The government will be liable to Shea on account of the affirmative action\n       program that was in operation at State more than fifteen years ago only if Shea\n       can show (a) that the program was unlawful – meaning generally that it was not\n       designed to cure a manifest imbalance in the workforce; (b) that, except for his\n       race, Shea was qualified for the program; and (c) that Shea was damaged during\n       the period of limitations by the continuing effects of the MLAAP.\n\nId. at 5–6. At that time, the factual record regarding the legality of State’s affirmative action\n\nplan had not been well developed. Id. at 8. Therefore, Judge Robertson denied both parties’\n\nmotions for summary judgment, id. at 11, and set a schedule for additional fact and expert\n\ndiscovery, see Scheduling Order, Sept. 23, 2009, ECF No. 73.\n\n       Several miscellaneous motions followed. First, State objected to the Court’s treatment of\n\nthe MLAAP as a voluntary affirmative action plan and requested reconsideration. See Def.’s\n\nFirst Mot. Reconsideration, Aug. 19, 2009, ECF No. 70. The Court denied this motion the next\n\nday. Order, Aug. 20, 2009, ECF No 71. On January 1, 2010, Shea filed his still-pending Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, ECF No. 74. Thereafter, the Court allowed State to amend its discovery\n\nresponses so State will not have been deemed to admit to several of Shea’s factual claims. See\n\nOrder Granting Def.’s Mot. for Leave to File, Feb. 2, 2010, ECF No. 78.\n\n                                               7\n\f       Judge Robertson retired in 2010, and the case was randomly reassigned to Judge Henry\n\nH. Kennedy on June 4, 2010. Reassignment of Civil Case, June 4, 2010, ECF No. 80. Less than\n\na month later, the case was randomly reassigned to Judge Emmet G. Sullivan. Reassignment of\n\nCivil Case, June 30, 2010, ECF No. 83. Judge Sullivan extended all discovery until September\n\n30, 2010. Minute Order, July 6, 2010; Revised Scheduling Order, July 6, 2010, ECF No. 84.\n\n       Shea then filed a motion for reconsideration, challenging various aspects of Judge\n\nRobertson’s prior rulings. Pl.’s Mot. Reconsideration, July 23, 2010, ECF No. 85. Shea also\n\nmoved to hold discovery deadlines in abeyance until resolution of this motion. ECF No. 86. In\n\nresponse, Judge Sullivan stayed the entire matter until an April 6, 2011 status conference.\n\nMinute Order, Mar. 9, 2011. At that conference, he orally extended the stay indefinitely.\n\n       The parties continued to file motions during the stay. State filed a second motion for\n\nreconsideration, again arguing that Congress mandated the MLAAP and that it was error to\n\nsubject it to the standards applicable to voluntary affirmative action plans. Def.’s Second Mot.\n\nReconsideration, Apr. 5, 2011, ECF No. 93. Shea then filed a motion to apply judicial estoppel\n\nto bar State from submitting an opposition to Shea’s still-pending motion for summary judgment.\n\nPl.’s Mot. to Apply Judicial Estoppel, Nov. 7, 2011, ECF No. 106.\n\n       On October 11, 2011, the case was reassigned by consent to its fourth (and, perhaps,\n\nfinal) judge, Chief Judge Royce C. Lamberth. See Reassignment of Civil Case, ECF No. 105.\n\nChief Judge Lamberth denied both parties’ motions for reconsideration and Shea’s motion for\n\napplication of judicial estoppel, and lifted the stay on July 30, 2012. See Shea v. Clinton, 850 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 153 (D.D.C. 2012); Shea v. Clinton, 880 F. Supp. 2d 113 (D.D.C. 2012). The Court set\n\na schedule for briefing on Shea’s still-pending summary judgment motion and any cross-motion\n\noffered by State. See Mem. & Order 9, July 30, 2012, ECF No. 118.\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f       On August 17, 2012, State filed a second Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 120.\n\nThis led to several more rounds of procedural motions and requests for extensions. See ECF\n\nNos. 122, 125, 129, 132. After the Court settled these issues (see ECF Nos. 137–39; Shea v.\n\nClinton, 228 F.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. 2012)), the parties’ motions for summary judgment were finally\n\nripe for consideration on December 22, 2012. With discovery closed and a full briefing on the\n\nmerits presented, the Court can finally consider the substantive merits of Shea’s claim.\n\nII.    LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A.      Summary Judgment\n\n       “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986). The mere\n\nexistence of any factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment; “the requirement is that there\n\nbe no genuine issue of material fact.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247–48 (emphasis in original). A\n\nfact is material if, under the applicable law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A\n\ndispute is genuine if the “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\n\nnonmoving party.” Id. Because “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and\n\nthe drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge,” the\n\n“evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in\n\nhis favor.” Id. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the existence of\n\na scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252. The inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence “must be reasonably probable and based on more than mere speculation.” Rogers\n\nCorp. v. E.P.A., 275 F.3d 1096, 1103 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (citations omitted). The nonmoving party\n\nmay not rely solely on allegations or conclusory statements. See Greene v. Dalton, 164 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The nonmoving party must present specific facts that would enable a\n\nreasonable jury to find in its favor. Id. If the evidence presented is “merely colorable, or is not\n\nsignificantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249–50.\n\n       In Celotex Corp v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986), the Supreme Court held that, after\n\n“adequate time for discovery and upon motion,” a court must enter summary judgment “against a\n\nparty who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to\n\nthat party’s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.” Elaborating:\n\n       In such a situation, there can be “no genuine issue as to any material fact,” since a\n       complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving\n       party's case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial. The moving party is\n       “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving party has\n       failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with\n       respect to which she has the burden of proof.\n\n477 U.S. at 322–23 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The Supreme Court meant “to disapprove a\n\nline of cases allowing a party opposing summary judgment to resist a properly made motion by\n\nreference only to its pleadings,” id. at 325:\n\n       In cases…where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial on a\n       dispositive issue, a summary judgment motion may properly be made in reliance\n       solely on the “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\n       on file.” Such a motion, whether or not accompanied by affidavits, will be “made\n       and supported as provided in this rule,” and Rule 56(e) therefore requires the\n       nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the\n       “depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,” designate\n       “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”\n\nId. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56).\n\n       Rule 56 allows a party seeking or opposing summary judgment to “object that the\n\nmaterial cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible\n\nin evidence.” Fed .R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). While at summary judgment the nonmovant “is not\n\nrequired to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial,” the evidence must be\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f“capable of being converted into admissible evidence.” Catrett v. Johns–Manville Sales Corp.,\n\n826 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1987). “Because the objective of summary judgment is to prevent\n\nunnecessary trials, and because ‘[v]erdicts cannot rest on inadmissible evidence,’ it follows that\n\nthe evidence considered at summary judgment must be capable ‘of being converted into\n\nadmissible evidence.’” Akers v. Liberty Mut. Group, 744 F. Supp. 2d 92, 96 (D.D.C. 2010)\n\n(quoting Greer v. Paulson, 505 F.3d 1306, 1315 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). At summary judgment the\n\nCourt cannot rely on “mere allegations or denials.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 256; see also 10A\n\nWRIGHT, MILLER & KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 2727 (3d ed. 2012) (“A judge\n\nmay not resolve a summary-judgment motion by ‘assumptions’ about matters that have not been\n\nproperly presented in the manner prescribed by the rule[.]”).\n\n       The filing of a cross-motion for summary judgment does not “concede the factual\n\nallegations of the opposing motion.” CEI Washington Bureau, Inc. v. Dep’t of Justice, 469 F.3d\n\n126, 129 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Cross-motions for summary judgment are treated separately. See\n\nMcKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (“The rule governing cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment…is that neither party waives the right to a full trial on the merits by filing\n\nits own motion; each side concedes that no material facts are at issue only for the purposes of its\n\nown motion.”). The court may—despite the parties’ stipulations that there are no disputed\n\nfacts—find material facts are in dispute, deny both motions, and proceed to trial. Id. at 1147 n.4.\n\n       B.      Affirmative Action Plans Under Title VII\n\n       Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, prohibits employment\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e–\n\n2, 2000e–3. Title VII protects all Americans, including white men, from race-based employment\n\ndiscrimination.   McDonald v. Santa Fe Trail Transp. Co., 427 U.S. 273, 280 (1976).\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fNevertheless, the Supreme Court has repeatedly interpreted Title VII to allow “race-conscious\n\nefforts to abolish traditional patterns of racial segregation and hierarchy.” Weber, 443 U.S. at\n\n204; see also Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. The Supreme Court has approved of affirmative action\n\nplans “designed to ‘eliminate manifest imbalances in traditionally segregated job categories.’”\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 628 (quoting Weber, 443 U.S. at 197).\n\n       “The standard for determining whether affirmative relief is justified under Title VII is\n\nless stringent than under the Constitution.” Stewart v. Rubin, 948 F. Supp. 1077, 1093 (D.D.C.\n\n1996) (Lamberth, J.) aff’d, 124 F.3d 1309 (D.C. Cir. 1997). See also Johnson, 480 U.S. at 627\n\nn.6 (“The fact that a public employer must also satisfy the Constitution does not negate the fact\n\nthat the statutory prohibition with which that employer must contend was not intended to extend\n\nas far as that of the Constitution.”); cf. Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 273 (1986)\n\n(applying strict scrutiny to constitutional challenge of affirmative action plan). Courts analyze\n\nTitle VII challenges to affirmative action plans under the analytical framework set forth in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). As the Supreme Court stated:\n\n      Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has been taken into\n      account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer\n      to articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an\n      affirmative action plan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as\n      the basis for the employer’s decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that\n      the employer’s justification is pretextual and the plan is invalid.\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 627. The plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of establishing the invalidity of\n\nthe affirmative action plan. Id. Reliance on an affirmative action plan is not an “affirmative\n\ndefense requiring the employer to carry the burden of proving the validity of the plan. The\n\nburden of proving its invalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id.\n\n       In analyzing affirmative action plans under Title VII, courts consider: (1) whether the\n\nplan was justified by a “manifest imbalance” reflecting an underrepresentation of minorities or\n\n                                                 12\n\fwomen in “traditionally segregated job categories”; and (2) whether the plan was properly\n\ntailored to cure the disparity without unnecessarily trammeling the interests of non-minorities.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. Statistically significant disparities between the percentage of minorities\n\nemployed and the percentage of qualified minorities in the labor market can be strong evidence\n\nof a manifest imbalance. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 433; Palmer v. Shultz, 815 F.2d 84, 91 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987). Writing for the Court in Johnson, Justice Brennan stated that a “manifest imbalance\n\nneed not be such that it would support a prima facie case against the employer.” 480 U.S. at\n\n632; see also id. at 633 n.11 (“However, as long as there is a manifest imbalance, an employer\n\nmay adopt a plan even where the disparity is not so striking, without being required to introduce\n\nthe nonstatistical evidence of past discrimination that would be demanded by the ‘prima facie’\n\nstandard.”); Stewart, 948 F. Supp. at 1094 (“Nor is a finding or admission of prior discrimination\n\nrequired in a Title VII case.     Indeed, to adopt affirmative measures to resolve Title VII\n\nemployment discrimination claims, the employer need not admit to any prior discrimination, nor\n\npoint ‘to evidence of an ‘arguable violation’ on its part.’” (quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630)).\n\n       Shortly after Johnson, Judge Kenneth Starr of the D.C. Circuit read Johnson as not\n\neviscerating the existing “predicate of discrimination” requirement—an employer may only use\n\naffirmative action as a remedy for prior discrimination. Hammon, 826 F.2d at 74–75. Statistics\n\nshowing an “egregious underrepresent[ation]” of minorities may give rise to an “inference of\n\ndiscrimination” by the employer. Id. at 75. Finding that the Johnson majority agreed with\n\nJustice O’Connor’s statement that affirmative action is permissible under Weber “only as a\n\nremedial device to eliminate actual or apparent discrimination or the lingering effects of this\n\ndiscrimination,” Johnson, 440 U.S. at 649 (O’Connor, J., concurring), Judge Starr held that\n\n“although an employer need not admit or prove that it had acted discriminatorily, evidence of the\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\feffects of its past or current discrimination is a prerequisite to lawful race-conscious employment\n\ndecisions,” 826 F.2d at 75 n.1.\n\n        In determining whether the affirmative action plan unnecessarily trammels the interests\n\nof non-minorities, courts focus on the nature of the plan—including whether the plan is\n\ntemporary, whether it was intended to attain or maintain a racial balance, whether it imposes\n\nquotas, whether it requires the discharge of white employees, and whether it is over-inclusive.\n\nSee, e.g., Weber, 443 U.S. at 208; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636–40; United States v. Paradise, 480\n\nU.S. 149, 182 (1987); Stewart, 948 F. Supp. at 1095–96.\n\nIII.    DISCUSSION\n\n        This case is eleven years old and on its fourth judge. The district court twice entered\n\nfinal judgment. Order, Sept. 30, 2003, ECF No. 15; Order, Nov. 21, 2008, ECF No. 64. The\n\ncourt of appeals twice reversed the district court and remanded for further proceedings.\n\nJudgment, Sept. 14, 2005, ECF No. 19; Mandate, Apr. 17, 2009, ECF No. 67. Given this\n\nprotracted history, the Court should clarify a few preliminary matters.\n\n        The Court will use the McDonnell Douglas / Johnson framework—described supra Part\n\nII.B.—to analyze plaintiff’s Title VII claims. This case only concerns Shea’s Title VII claims.\n\nShea voluntarily withdrew a number of his claims in response to State’s first Motion to Dismiss.\n\nSee Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot. to Dismiss 1–2, Feb. 10, 2003, ECF No. 12. Shea abandoned\n\nother constitutional claims when he elected not to appeal their dismissal. See Shea, 409 F.3d at\n\n450–51 (noting that Shea only appealed the district court’s dismissal of his pay grade\n\ndiscrimination claim). To the extent Shea has any remaining constitutional claims, they would\n\nbe time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations applicable to equal protection claims. 3\n\n\n3\n Shea’s equal protection claims would be “subject to the District’s three-year residual limitation period.” Munoz v.\nBd. of Trustees of Univ. of Dist. of Columbia, 590 F. Supp. 2d 21, 28 (D.D.C. 2008) aff’d, 427 F. Appx. 1 (D.C. Cir.\n\n                                                        14\n\fTherefore, the Title VII standard articulated by the Supreme Court in Johnson v. Transportation\n\nAgency, 480 U.S. 616 (1987) applies—rather than the constitutional standard articulated by the\n\nSupreme Court in Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education, 476 U.S. 267 (1986). Over Justice\n\nScalia’s vigorous dissent, 480 U.S. at 657–77, Justice Brennan’s majority opinion in Johnson\n\nmade clear that the statutory test differs from the constitutional test, 480 U.S. at 627 n.6.\n\n         Johnson and its progeny describe the Title VII standard under which courts analyze\n\nvoluntary affirmative action programs.              State repeatedly argued that the MLAAP is not a\n\n“voluntary” plan—that the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 22 U.S.C. § 3922a, mandated\n\nthe creation of an affirmative action plan.                   See, e.g., Def.’s Mem. ISO its First Mot.\n\nReconsideration 4–6; Def.’s Mem. ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration.                              This Court has\n\nrejected these arguments, finding that while the FRAA “clearly requires State to implement a\n\nplan to address mid-level positions, it is silent on to the means by which State is to accomplish\n\nthis goal.” Shea v. Clinton, 850 F. Supp. 2d 153, 159 (D.D.C. 2012). The Court concluded,\n\nwhile also rejecting State’s argument for legislative immunity, that “[t]he FRAA clearly does not\n\nmandate an exception to Title VII and does not mandate creation of the MLAAP specifically.”\n\n\n\n2011). “To establish an equal protection claim, plaintiff must show that she was singled out from among others\nsimilarly situated on the basis of race and/or national origin.” Id. The plaintiff cannot rely on the “ongoing negative\nconsequences” of the prior discrimination to extend the statute of limitations for his equal protection claim. Id.\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 123 Stat. 5 (2009), does not address constitutional or 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims.\nThe Ledbetter Act did explicitly mention that it applies to claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the\nAge Discrimination Act of 1967, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nId. It would be very odd for the Ledbetter Act to specify, with great detail, the types of claims to which it applies\nand then, sub silentio, change the statute of limitations for claims under the equal protection clause or § 1983. See,\ne.g., ANTONIN SCALIA & BRIAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 93–100 (2012)\n(explaining semantic canon that “[n]othing is to be added to what the text states or reasonably implies (casus\nomissus pro omisso habendus est). That is, a matter not covered is to be treated as not covered.”); id. at 107–111\n(explaining the “negative-implication canon” which suggests that “[t]he expression of one thing implies the\nexclusion of others (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).”).\nFurthermore, courts typically look to state law to determine the statute of limitations for constitutional claims.\nSee Carney v. Am. Univ., 151 F.3d 1090, 1096 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (D.C. Code § 12-301(8) provides statute of\nlimitations for § 1983 claims); Banks v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 802 F.2d 1416, 1429 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (§\n12-301(8) provides statute of limitations for most Bivens actions).\n\n                                                         15\n\fId. at 162. As this Court has found previously, see id. at 158–62, it reiterates that MLAAP is a\n\nvoluntary affirmative action plan subject to Johnson and its progeny.\n\n       This case is not a “mixed motive” or “direct evidence” case. Shea’s reliance on Price\n\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989) is misplaced. See Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot.\n\nSumm. J. & Reply ISO Mot. Summ. J. 39 (“Pl’s Opp’n & Reply”), Aug. 30, 2012, ECF No. 123.\n\nIn Price Waterhouse, the Supreme Court set the standard for “mixed motive” Title VII cases:\n\nOnce a plaintiff shows an employer acted with an impermissible motive, the burden of proof\n\nshifts to the employer to prove that it would have made the same decision even in the absence of\n\nthe impermissible motive. 490 U.S. at 242. In 1991, Congress amended Title VII; section 107\n\nof the 1991 Act codified Price Waterhouse “to the extent that it shifts the burden of persuasion to\n\nthe defendant to prove a nondiscriminatory motive was at work.” 2 BARBARA T. LINDEMANN,\n\nPAUL GROSSMAN & C. GEOFFREY WEIRICH, EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW 2544 (4th ed.\n\n2007). However, this is not a “mixed motive” case, and courts typically do not treat “reverse\n\ndiscrimination” cases as falling under the burden-shifting framework of Price Waterhouse and §\n\n107. See id. at 2544–46. Courts in this Circuit have long held that the mere existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan does not provide “direct evidence” of discrimination. See, e.g., Parker v.\n\nBaltimore & Ohio R.R., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981). “In the absence of direct\n\nevidence of discrimination,”—of which there is none in this case—“disparate-treatment claims\n\nunder Title VII are analyzed under the burden-shifting framework set forth in McDonnell\n\nDouglas[.]” Teneyck v. Omni Shoreham Hotel, 365 F.3d 1139, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n       Shea may only challenge State’s revised FY 1990–92 Multi-Year Affirmative Action\n\nPlan. When the Court refers to the “MLAAP” generally, it refers to the 1990–92 plan in effect at\n\nthe time of Shea’s hiring. At times, Shea presents arguments based on deficiencies in State’s\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fearlier 1987 Multi-Year Affirmative Action Plan. See generally Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply. This plan\n\nwas not in effect when Shea applied to State. Shea cannot directly challenge the 1987 MLAAP,\n\nand the details of its alleged shortcomings are of limited probative value. On the other hand, the\n\nfindings of underrepresentation and prior discrimination underpinning the 1987 MLAAP may be\n\nrelevant to justifying the later plan. The 1990–92 plan was a continuation and refinement of an\n\nexisting plan. State did not need to justify the revised plan out of whole cloth; it may rely in part\n\non its earlier findings of discrimination and underrepresentation if it found that significant\n\nunderrepresentation persisted, and race conscious policies continued to be necessary.\n\n       When considering the numbers, the Court focuses on the mid- and senior-levels of career\n\nForeign Service generalist officers. At the time, the Department of State had two personnel\n\nsystems—one covering the “Foreign Service,” and one covering the “Civil Service system.” See\n\nEx. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 26 (Shea – 00090). The “Civil Service system” covered the gamut of\n\nemployees responsible for the general administration of the State Department, including clerical,\n\ntechnical, and legal staff. Within the Foreign Service, there are Foreign Service Officers (or\n\n“Generalists”) and Foreign Service Specialists.         Foreign Service Officers have “general\n\nresponsibility for carrying out and conducting the United States’ foreign relations throughout the\n\nworld.”    Id.   Within this corps, State assigned its officers to one of four “cones”—\n\nAdministrative, Consular, Economic, and Political. Foreign Service Specialists, on the other\n\nhand, are “professional specialists in communications, security, medicine, office support skills,\n\nand other fields.” Id. State is responsible for meeting EEO goals for both the Civil and Foreign\n\nService, and for both Foreign Service Generalists and Specialists. Many of the reports submitted\n\nby State also discuss underrepresentation in the Civil Service and Foreign Service Specialist\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\franks. See, e.g., Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (State FY 1990–92 Multi-Year Affirmative Action\n\nPlan); Ex. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (GAO report on underrepresentation in Foreign Service).\n\n       Shea applied for, and received, a position as an entry-level Foreign Service Officer. See\n\nEx. 12 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Agreement to Join the Foreign Service, April 22, 1992); Ex. 13 to\n\nDef.’s Cross-Mot. (employment form SF 50-B). Therefore, the rates of underrepresentation of\n\ncareer Foreign Service generalist officers are relevant to this case. Underrepresentation in the\n\nmid- and senior-levels is relevant because Congress specifically expressed dissatisfaction of the\n\nminority representation at both levels, and directed State to take action to correct for these\n\nspecific imbalances. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b); 1988–89 FRAA,\n\nPub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b)).\n\n       With the correct standard and object of inquiry settled, the Court reiterates that in order\n\nfor Shea to prevail, he must prove “(1) that the MLAAP was unlawful, (2) that except for his\n\nrace, Shea was qualified for the program, and (3) that Shea was damaged during the period in\n\nquestion by the continuing effects of the MLAAP.” Shea, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 163. At trial, Shea\n\nwould have the burden of proving the unlawfulness of the MLAPP. See Johnson, 489 U.S. at\n\n627. He cannot do meet this burden with admissible evidence, and thus has “fail[ed] to make a\n\nshowing sufficient to establish an element essential” to his case. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.\n\n       A.      Shea’s Prima facie Case of Discrimination\n\n       Typically, when an “employer has asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason” for\n\ntaking an adverse action against the plaintiff, “the district court need not—and should not—\n\ndecide whether the plaintiff actually made out a prima facie case under McDonnell Douglas.”\n\nBrady v. Office of Sergeant of Arms, 520 F.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (emphasis in original).\n\nIn many instances, determining whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie claim is “a\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\flargely unnecessary sideshow,” id.—especially considering that in a “typical Title VII suit,” the\n\nplaintiff only needs to “establish that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an\n\nadverse employment action; and (3) the adverse action gives rise to an inference of\n\ndiscrimination[.]” Checka v. Rite Aid of Washington, D.C., Inc., 538 F. Supp. 2d 82, 86 (D.D.C.\n\n2008) (citing George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405, 412 (D.C. Cir. 2005)).\n\n       However, “[w]hen the plaintiff is a white male and alleges reverse discrimination…the\n\nrequirement for establishing a prima facie case changes.” Checka, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 86 (citing\n\nHarding v. Gray, 9 F.3d 150, 153 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). Instead of showing that he is a member of a\n\nminority group, the plaintiff must show “‘background circumstances [that] support the suspicion\n\nthat the defendant is the unusual employer who discriminates against the majority.’” Harding, 9\n\nF.3d at 153 (quoting Parker, 652 F.2d at 1017).           This requirement is “not designed to\n\ndisadvantage the white plaintiff,” but “merely substitutes for the minority plaintiff’s burden to\n\nshow that he is a member of a racial minority; both are criteria for determining when the\n\nemployer’s conduct raises an ‘inference of discrimination.’” Id. at 153.\n\n       A white male plaintiff may show background circumstances in one of two ways. First, he\n\n“may produce evidence that his employer has reason or inclination to discriminate against the\n\nmajority.” Checka, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (citing Mastro v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 447 F.3d\n\n843, 851 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). He may do so by presenting evidence of “political pressure to\n\npromote a particular minority because of his race, pressure to promote minorities in general, and\n\nproposed affirmative action plans.” Mastro, 446 F.3d at 851. Second, the plaintiff may offer\n\nevidence that there is “‘something ‘fishy’ about the facts of the case at hand that raises an\n\ninference of discrimination.’” Id. (quoting Harding, 9 F.3d at 153). “Evidence that a white\n\nplaintiff was given little or no consideration for a position that was given to a minority candidate\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\for that a minority candidate was promoted over four objectively qualified white candidates has\n\nbeen sufficient to show ‘something ‘fishy[.]’” Checka, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 87.\n\n       At least one district court in this jurisdiction has held that the mere “existence of an\n\naffirmative action policy,” does not “automatically impl[y] discrimination against the majority”\n\nfor the purposes of establishing a prima facie case. Schmidt v. Chao, Civ. No. 04–892, 2006 WL\n\n1663389, *3 (D.D.C. June 13, 2006). “Rather, there must be a causal connection between the\n\ntwo, demonstrated by direct or circumstantial evidence.” Id. As an example of such a “causal\n\nconnection,” the Schmidt Court cites Bishopp v. District of Columbia, 788 F.3d 781, 786 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1986), where “the connection between the existence of an affirmative action plan and\n\nreverse discrimination was made when the D.C. Fire Department promoted an African-American\n\ncandidate, with obviously-inferior credentials, over four (4) Caucasian candidates who were\n\nbetter qualified.” Schmidt, 2006 WL 1663389, at *3.\n\n       To show the necessary connection, Shea may offer some evidence creating an issue of\n\nmaterial fact as to his qualifications for a mid-level position. In denying both parties’ motions\n\nfor summary judgment, the Court found that “State has admitted [Shea’s] qualifications by\n\nfailing to respond to proper requests for admissions.” Mem. Order 9, Aug. 11, 2009, ECF No. 69\n\n(emphasis in original). Thereafter, State requested leave to amend its discovery responses.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Am./Correct, Jan. 7, 2010, ECF No. 75. Over Shea’s objection, this Court held:\n\n       [I]t appears (a) that defendant’s asserted “admission” that plaintiff would have\n       been qualified for MLAAP occurs only by operation of the government’s failure\n       to respond to a request for admissions; and (b) that the failure to respond was\n       justifiable, given the stops and starts that have occurred in this litigation. It also\n       appears, however, (c) that injecting the rhetorical question of the plaintiff’s\n       qualifications for MLAAP at this late stage of this long-running case would not\n       “promote the presentation of the merits of the action,” and (d) that it would\n       prejudice the plaintiff in maintaining or defending the action on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       It is accordingly ORDERED that defendant’s motion is granted, but that, unless\n       the government is prepared to demonstrate that any non-minority person applied\n       for and was denied acceptance to MLAAP because of his or her qualifications, the\n       plaintiff will be deemed to have been qualified for MLAAP – except for his race\n       (or national origin, or ethnicity).\n\nOrder 1–2, Feb. 2, 2010, ECF No. 78 (emphasis in original). In response, State identified two\n\nminority applicants who had applied for and were denied acceptance to MLAAP because of their\n\nqualifications. See Decl. of Alina Eldred ¶¶ 4–11, Sept. 17, 2012, ECF No. 128-2. This misread\n\nthe Court’s Order. The Court required State to offer proof that non-minority applicants were\n\ndenied acceptance to MLAAP because of their qualifications; it said nothing about the status of\n\nminority applicants. Since State’s submission was not responsive to this Court’s Order, the\n\nCourt deems Shea to have been qualified for MLAAP, except for his race.\n\n       State’s admission that Shea would have been qualified but for his race establishes the\n\nnecessary causal connection between the MLAAP and discrimination against the majority. The\n\nburden of establishing “background circumstances” is “minimal,” and not intended to be “an\n\nadditional hurdle for white plaintiffs.” Harding, 9 F.3d at 153–54. Therefore, this Court finds\n\nthat Shea has demonstrated “background circumstances that support the suspicion that the\n\ndefendant is the unusual employer that discriminates against the majority,” id. at 153, and thus\n\nhas sufficiently stated his prima facie case.\n\n       B.      State’s Reliance on its Affirmative Action Program\n\n       Shea has established a prima facie case of employment discrimination under Title VII.\n\nTherefore, State has the burden of producing “admissible evidence that, if believed, would\n\nestablish that the employer’s action was motivated by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.”\n\nTeneyck, 365 F.3d at 1151. Under Johnson, the “existence of an affirmative action plan provides\n\nsuch a rationale.” 480 U.S. at 627. “As a practical matter…an employer will generally seek to\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\favoid a charge of pretext by presenting evidence in support of its plan.          That does not\n\nmean…that reliance on an affirmative action plan is…an affirmative defense requiring the\n\nemployer to carry the burden of proving the validity of the plan. The burden of proving its\n\ninvalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 626–27.\n\n       The “employer’s burden is one of production, not persuasion.” Teneyck, 365 F.3d at\n\n1151. “By producing evidence (whether ultimately persuasive or not) of nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons,” the employer will have “sustained [its] burden of production.” St. Mary’s Honor Ctr.\n\nv. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509 (1993) (emphasis in original). Courts should not make credibility\n\nassessments regarding the employer’s evidence; an employer meets its burden if it “introduce[s]\n\nevidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the adverse action.” Id. (emphasis in original). “The employer ‘need not persuade the\n\ncourt that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant’s\n\nevidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.’”\n\nAntrum v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 710 F. Supp. 2d 112, 118–19 (D.D.C. 2010)\n\n(quoting Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1981)).\n\n       The question then is whether State has offered evidence which, taken as true, permits the\n\nconclusion that State acted pursuant to a lawful affirmative action plan. To the extent this Court\n\ndiscusses evidence that goes beyond merely satisfying State’s burden of production, this does not\n\nsuggest that State has—at any time—the burden of persuasion. State’s evidence concerning the\n\nlawfulness of its plan, however, can make it harder for Shea to prove that State’s asserted non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons are merely pretext and that State employed an unlawful affirmative action\n\nplan. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626–27.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f                  1.       Manifest Imbalance and Discrimination in the Workforce\n\n         There must be a manifest imbalance in the workforce, reflecting discrimination in\n\ntraditionally segregated job categories, justifying State’s adoption of an affirmative action plan.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. As explained by Weber and Johnson, statistically significant disparities\n\nbetween minorities in the workplace and qualified minorities in the labor market may establish a\n\nmanifest imbalance. For “skilled” positions the relevant comparator group is the number of\n\nminorities with the requisite qualifications. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632–33 (“[I]n determining\n\nwhether an imbalance exists that would justify taking sex or race into account, a comparison of\n\nthe percentage of minorities or women in the employer’s work force with the percentage in the\n\narea labor market or general population is appropriate in analyzing jobs that require no special\n\nexpertise…. Where a job requires special training, however, the comparison should be with\n\nthose in the labor force who possess the relevant qualifications.”). 4\n\n         Since affirmative action plans are justified by their “remedial” purpose, State must offer\n\nsome evidence of a “predicate of discrimination.” See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 80–81. Stark\n\nstatistical disparities might, by themselves, infer past discrimination by the employer. See\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 636 (manifest imbalance shown when none of the 238 skilled positions\n\nwere occupied by a women).               If the statistical comparisons merely reflect general societal\n\ndiscrimination—for which the employer was not responsible—the numbers alone might not\n\njustify remedial action. See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 80–81. State is not required to “admit” to past\n\n\n4\n  While Congress directed State to increase its minority recruitment efforts “so that the Foreign Service becomes\ntruly representation of the American people,” 1988–89 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b), there is no\nindication that State ever used the “American people” as its comparator when calculating minority\nunderrepresentation. Cf. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 654 (although stated long-term goal of affirmative action plan was to\nreach employment levels that “approximat[ed] the distribution of women…in the Santa Clara County workforce,”\nthis “long-range goal was never used as a guide for actual hiring decisions” and “was merely a statement of\naspiration wholly without operational significance”). State based its short-term goals on the number of qualified\nminorities in the workforce, not the number in the total labor market or general population. See generally infra; Exs.\n2 & 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.\n\n                                                         23\n\fdiscrimination. Johnson, 480 U.S. 616, 650 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“Although the employer\n\nneed not point to any contemporaneous findings of actual discrimination, …the employer must\n\npoint to evidence sufficient to establish a firm basis for believing that remedial action is\n\nrequired[.]”). Nevertheless, there must be “evidence of at least the effects of the employer’s past\n\nor current discrimination.”         2 LINDEMANN, GROSSMAN & WEIRICH, EMPLOYMENT\n\nDISCRIMINATION LAW at 2526 (citing Hammon, 826 F.3d at 74–75 & n.1). Some combination of\n\nstatistical imbalance and evidence of the employer’s past or current discrimination can provide\n\nthe necessary factual predicate to justify a remedial affirmative action plan. See, e.g., id. at 2525;\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 632; Hammon, 826 F.3d at 74–75, 80–81.\n\n                       a.      Statistical imbalance and minority underrepresentation\n\n       The defendant offers sufficient evidence to show that a finding of significant minority\n\nunderrepresentation motivated the State Department’s adoption of its affirmative action plan. As\n\ndiscussed in Part I.A. supra, the chronic underrepresentation of minorities in the State\n\nDepartment—and the mid- and senior-levels of the Foreign Service in particular—had long been\n\nan issue. Congress demanded greater minority representation at State, and closely monitored\n\nState’s efforts to set and meet diversity goals. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 99–93; 1988–89\n\nFRAA, Pub. L. 100–204. Congress held hearings where representatives discussed minority\n\nunderrepresentation in the Foreign Service, explored the nature and extent of the problem, and\n\nasked State what it was doing to fix the problem. See Underrepresentation of Women and\n\nMinorities in the Foreign Service—State Department: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the Civil\n\nService of the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989) (Ex. 4 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot.); The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint Hearing Before the Subcomm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fon Int’l Operations of the H. Comm. on Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Service of\n\nthe H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989) (Ex. 5 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.).\n\n        In the late 1980s—directly preceding the drafting and adoption of the 1990–92\n\nMLAAP—two reports studied the Foreign Service personnel and management systems. Thomas\n\nCommission Report; Bremer Study Group Report. 5 Congress mandated the “Thomas Report” in\n\nthe 1988–89 FRAA; the Secretary of State himself commissioned the “Bremer Report.” See The\n\nDepartment of State in the 21st Century (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry Sikorski, Chairman,\n\nSubcomm. on Civil Service). As interpreted by Rep. Gerry Sikorski, the Chairman of the Civil\n\nService Subcommittee, these reports “tell [Congress] that management of the U.S. Foreign\n\nService is seriously flawed.”        Id.   The reports “show that officer training has particularly\n\nsuffered,” and address in particular the “issues of recruitment, career development and training,\n\nthe underrepresentation of women and minorities, [and] the lack of management skills[.]” Id.\n\n        In June 1989, the General Accounting Office (“GAO”) issued a report titled, “State\n\nDepartment: Minorities and Women Are Underrepresented in the Foreign Service.” See Ex. 3 to\n\nDef.’s Cross-Mot. This report found that while existing affirmative action programs had made\n\nsome progress, minorities remained underrepresented:\n\n        The State Department increased minority representation in the Foreign Service\n        from 7 percent in 1981 to 11 percent in 1987…. In 1987 minorities and white\n        women were still substantially underrepresented when compared to civilian labor\n        force data that the EEOC has issued to measure federal agencies.\n\n        Progress has been mixed in the FS officer and specialist categories. At the entry\n        level, underrepresentation in the FS officer corps has been eliminated, except for\n        Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders. In the mid-level ranks of the officer corps,\n        minority male representation has increased, but minority and white women have\n        made less progress.          In State’s Senior Foreign Service positions,\n        underrepresentation of minorities and white women is still pervasive.\n\n5\n   Both reports were entered into the record during The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint Hearing\nBefore the Subcomm. on Int’l Operations of the H. Comm. on Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Service\nof the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989)) (Ex. 5 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.).\n\n                                                     25\n\fId. at 15 (Shea – 008689). An accompanying chart shows that, as of September 1987, females of\n\nevery race were underrepresented as senior and mid-level Foreign Service Officers, minorities of\n\nevery race were underrepresented as senior Foreign Service Officers, and Hispanics and\n\nAsian/Pacific Islanders were underrepresented in the mid-levels.                        Id. at 20 (Table 2.3:\n\nUnderrepresentation of Minorities and White Women in State’s Foreign Service by Grade (As of\n\nSept. 1987)) (Shea – 008694).\n\n         Shea seizes on this chart—and State’s unfortunate misinterpretation of it 6—as evidence\n\nthat not all MLAAP-eligible minority groups were underrepresented. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply\n\n4–6. After all, the chart showed that as of 1987 black and Indian/Alaskan males were fully\n\nrepresented in the Foreign Service Officer mid-levels. However, this chart neither undermines\n\nState’s evidentiary proffer that the MLAAP was lawful, nor proves that the MLAAP was\n\nunlawful. First, the GAO report acknowledged the limitations of its numbers—the agency had to\n\ncompare 1987 State Department employment data with a 1980 comparator population:\n\n         The criteria established by the EEOC is based on 1980 census data, but\n         considerable change has occurred in the civilian labor force since 1980. If these\n         changes were considered in analyzing State’s representation, the extent to which\n         minorities and women are underrepresented would be worse than depicted in table\n         2.3. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that blacks, Hispanics, and white\n         women have increased their representation in the civilian labor force in recent\n         years.\n\n6\n  In a rather serious mistake, State used this chart in its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment to show that “in 1987\nthere were no African-American, Hispanic, or Indian males in mid-level positions.” Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J.\n12 (emphasis in original). Worse still, State bolded this language, drawing special attention to its mistake. Digging\nthe hole deeper, State was repeating a mistake they had made previously—and had filed an errata to correct. See\nDef.’s Reply ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration 6, May 18, 2011, ECF No. 98 (stating the same incorrect\nstatement verbatim, minus the bolding); Errata to Def.’s Reply ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration 1, May 25,\n2011, ECF No. 100 (admitting that the chart “actually shows a comparison” of workforce and census data “to\ndemonstrate that, under current EEOC criteria, the underrepresentation of minority males in some levels of the\nForeign Service was ‘0’”).\nPerhaps State did not take its pro se opponent seriously. The Court warns State that such sloppy lawyering could\nhave cost State dearly if State had the burden of persuasion, rather than simply the burden of production. If this\nwere a constitutional challenge—and strict scrutiny applied—State may have failed to justify the MLAAP based on\nthe record submitted.\n\n                                                        26\n\fEx. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 21 (Shea – 008695). Hammon made clear that a court must use the\n\nmost recent available data when determining whether there is a manifest imbalance. 826 F.3d at\n\n77–78. When State adopted the 1990–92 MLAAP, it had more recent work force data available.\n\nSee Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 47–47a (Shea – 00116–17) (discussed in more detail infra).\n\nSecond, Shea’s criticism takes a narrow view of the MLAAP. The MLAAP may work to\n\nincrease minority representation not only in the mid-levels, but also in the senior-levels. Table\n\n2.3 shows across-the-board minority underrepresentation in the senior-levels. Ex. 3 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 20 (Shea – 008694). Mid-level minority placement may not be necessary for all\n\ngroups, if the only concern was underrepresentation in the mid-levels. However, mid-level\n\nplacement helps alleviate the significant underrepresentation of minorities in the senior levels by\n\nmaking more minorities eligible for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service. Viewed this\n\nway, Table 2.3 does not undermine State’s evidentiary proffer. 7\n\n         When State formally adopted the revised 1990–92 MLAAP, it made additional findings\n\nabout manifest imbalance based on more recent work force and labor pool data. The document\n\ndescribing the 1990–92 MLAAP includes several analyses of the State Department workforce,\n\nand which job categories had a “manifest imbalance” for which groups. See Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 45–53a (Multi-Year Affirmative Action Plan FY 1990–92) (Shea – 00108–33). In\n\nmaking these comparisons, officials compared State employment data from FY 1989 and 1990\n\nwith the most recent Occupational National Civilian Labor Force Data for Public Administration\n\nAdministrators and Officials. See id. at 47 (Shea – 00116). The analysis of Foreign Service\n\n\n7\n  This may be a generous reading of Table 2.3, but that is what is required at this stage. State does not need to\nconvince the Court that its plan was lawful. To meet its burden of production, “[t]he employer ‘need not persuade\nthe court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant’s evidence raises a\ngenuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.’” Antrum, 710 F. Supp. at 118–19 (quoting\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 254–55).\n\n                                                          27\n\fGeneralists showed a “manifest imbalance” for “White females, Black males, Black females,\n\nHispanic females, American Indian males, [and] American Indian females.” Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 47 (Shea – 00116). The document also showed that within the Senior Foreign\n\nService “minority officers were promoted at a lower rate (3.7 percent) than White males (8.8\n\npercent) or White females (9.0 percent).” Id. at 74 (Shea – 00153). Minorities were also\n\npromoted from the lower-levels to the mid-levels—and within the mid-levels—at a lower rate\n\nthan white men or women. Id. While the data showed that minorities were promoted from class\n\nFS-01 8 to the Senior Foreign Service at a marginally higher rate, id., the plan warned that:\n\n        It is important to note, however, that promotion rates at the senior levels are based\n        on a very small number of eligible minorities and White women. For example,\n        Black females were promoted to the Senior Foreign Service at a 33-percent rate (2\n        of 6) compared with an 11-percent rate for White males (170 of 1,518).\n\nId. at 75 (Shea – 00154). The fact that there were so few minorities even eligible for promotion\n\ninto the Senior Foreign Service skewed the statistics regarding promotion rates.\n\n        “Over-inclusiveness” charges can also be levied at the 1990 data. The 1990–92 plan\n\ndocument does not show that all minority groups eligible for the MLAAP were in fact\n\nunderrepresented in the mid-levels.         However, this does not necessarily undermine State’s\n\nevidentiary proffer. First, as detailed supra, mid-level minority hiring not only immediately\n\ncured imbalances in the mid-levels, but created more opportunities for minorities to ascend to the\n\nSenior Foreign Service. As the 1990–92 plan noted, very few minorities were eligible for\n\npromotion into the Senior Foreign Service. Id. Second, while the MLAAP was “open” to all\n\nEEO minority groups, the plan only established representation goals for groups for which it\n\nfound a “manifest imbalance.” See id. at 54 (for Foreign Service Generalists, establishing goals\n\nto increase the representation of white females, black males, black females, Hispanic females,\n\n8\n  FS-01 being the highest “mid-level” Foreign Service Officer class. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 11; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10\n(admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 11).\n\n                                                    28\n\fAmerican Indian males, and American Indian females—the same groups the plan identified\n\nearlier as being underrepresented) (Shea – 00134). Or as the defendant puts it, “the 1990–1992\n\nMLAAP corrected for the weakness identified by the GAO…and specifically identified the\n\nmanifest imbalance in each specific minority group within which Foreign Service ‘conal system’\n\n(Administrative, Consular, Economic and Political), as compared to the more timely data for a\n\ncomparator population, and then set goals for only those under-represented groups.” Def.’s\n\nReply ISO its Cross-Mot. Summ. J. 12 (“Def.’s Reply”), Oct. 3, 2012, ECF No. 133 (citing Ex. 2\n\nto Def.’s Cross-Mot 46–46b, 47–47a, 50–51b, 54, 61–67).\n\n                       b.      Showing of a predicate of discrimination\n\n       The bare numbers only tell one side of the story. State does rely solely on a statistical\n\nimbalance in the mid- and senior-levels.         It has also provided evidence regarding past\n\ndiscrimination in the Foreign Service and institutional and systemic barriers to minority\n\nadvancement. State has provided enough evidence to show a “predicate of discrimination”\n\nimplying the statistical imbalances are due in part to some past discrimination by State, rather\n\nthan simply reflecting societal discrimination. See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 74–75, 80–81.\n\n       State’s hiring and promotion practices had been the subject of many employment\n\ndiscrimination lawsuits. See Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign\n\nService (statement of Rep. Sikorski) (detailing history of discrimination suits against State,\n\nstating: “This is not a new phenomenon. The department has lost a lot of money in a variety of\n\nlitigation regarding discrimination.”). State, and the Foreign Service in particular, drew the ire of\n\nCongress. The Thomas and Bremer Reports, discussed supra, went beyond calculating rates of\n\nminority representation.    With a particular emphasis on the Foreign Service, the reports\n\nexamined which practices contributed to—and exacerbated—minority underrepresentation. The\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\freports identified systemic and procedural barriers to minority hiring and advancement. See\n\nThomas Comm. Report; Bremer Study Group Report; The Department of State in the 21st\n\nCentury (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry Sikorski). These findings were echoed by officials\n\nfrom the GAO, who concluded that “some of State’s hiring, promotion, and assignment\n\nprocesses have a disproportionate effect on minorities and women.” Underrepresentation of\n\nWomen and Minorities in the Foreign Service, (statement of Joseph Kelly, Director, Security &\n\nInt’l Affairs Div., GAO). These reports focused on recent issues—not, as in Hammon, issues\n\nburied deep in the past. 826 F.3d at 77–78 (employer may not rely on findings of discrimination\n\nfrom decades ago, but should justify its plan with evidence of more recent discrimination).\n\n       Prior to the adoption of the 1990–92 MLAAP, some officials concluded that the Foreign\n\nService was “discriminatory.” For example, Rep. Sikorski, Chairman of the House Civil Service\n\nSubcommittee, held a hearing on September 22, 1989, titled, “Underrepresentation of Women\n\nand Minorities in the Foreign Service.” See Ex. 4 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. In his introductory\n\nremarks, Rep. Sikorski called the Foreign Service an “old-boys club,” and cited a litany of\n\nstudies and lawsuits charging the State Department with discrimination. Id. He noted that “[t]he\n\nnecessity and extent of legal action [against State] raises serious questions about the\n\ndepartment’s commitment to creating a workplace free of discrimination.” Id. For example,\n\nfrom 1976 to 1986, over 240 EEO cases were filed against State; and in 1985, 1986, and 1987\n\nthe State Department violated a consent decree it voluntarily entered into to settle an earlier\n\ndiscrimination suit. Id. Rep. Sikorski noted that the minorities and women who were hired into\n\nthe Foreign Service were disproportionally placed into less prestigious jobs, from which\n\nadvancement to the senior-levels was more difficult. Id. In a later hearing, Rep. Sikorski stated\n\nthat, in addition to the findings of the Bremer and Thomas Reports, “[i]nvestigations and\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fhearings conducted by the Subcommittee of the Civil Service have also documented serious\n\ninstances of discriminatory treatment by the Foreign Service of women, minorities, and people\n\nwith handicaps.” The Department of State in the 21st Century (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry\n\nSikorski) (going on to list specific findings of discrimination in the Foreign Service).\n\n       Several of the witnesses who appeared before the congressional subcommittee—those\n\nwith first-hand knowledge of the workings of State—testified about discrimination in the Foreign\n\nService.   See, e.g., Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared testimony of Mary Lee Garrison, Co-President, State Dep’t Chapter, Women’s Action\n\nOrg.) (“Instances of blatant sexism and discrimination have declined, although some still take\n\nplace, but a simple glance at the statistics contained in the recent GAO report…will confirm the\n\ncontinued existence of a problem.”); Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the\n\nForeign Service (prepared statement of Clarence E. Hodges, Member, Management Council of\n\nthe Dep’t of State) (Calling some of State’s positions on its equal opportunity promotion\n\n“indefensible,” citing “too little progress and unacceptable behavior in this regard.” All around\n\nthe world, Mr. Hodges “encountered complaints of discrimination from our employees and\n\ncriticisms from foreigners for that same discrimination as exhibited by our predominately white\n\nmale diplomatic corps.”); Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared testimony of Charles Hughes Jr., Vice President for the State Dep’t Thursday\n\nLuncheon Group) (“I entered on duty in State in late 1965 and had my first experience with\n\ndiscrimination, aside from what I had experienced while stationed in the South. …[W]hile there\n\nare some very good, progressive minded people at State, there are also those who find it much\n\neasier to deny fair treatment to some, and thus keep faith with their peers.” *** “Minorities\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fhave been underrepresented purposely, and the rationale of improperly applied statistics, have\n\nprovided the relief for the consciences of the establishment.”).\n\n       When the Court looks at the whole picture—statistical findings of minority\n\nunderrepresentation and lower promotion rates, history of discrimination lawsuits, reports\n\nfinding systemic flaws at State, repeated congressional oversight and criticism, testimony from\n\nknowledgeable witnesses that the Foreign Service was discriminatory—it finds that State has met\n\nits evidentiary proffer of showing a proper factual predicate for its affirmative action plan.   It\n\nhas provided enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the MLAAP was justified\n\nby correcting a manifest imbalance in the mid- and senior-levels of the Foreign Service, and it\n\nserved to remedy the lingering effects of State’s past discrimination.\n\n               2.      Avoiding Unnecessarily Trammeling the Interests of Non-Minorities\n\n       Even if there is a manifest imbalance in the workplace, State must still design and\n\nimplement its affirmative action plan in a way that does not unnecessarily trammel the interests\n\nof non-minorities or create an absolute bar to the advancement of non-minorities. Weber, 443\n\nU.S. at 208; Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81. The plan must consider race-neutral alternatives and be\n\ncarefully tailored to remedy the problem at hand. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81. It must be a\n\ntemporary measure designed to “eliminate a manifest racial imbalance” rather than “maintain a\n\nracial balance.” Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. The plan should pay special attention to how it\n\naccomplishes its goals, and the extent to which its methods burden non-minorities. Johnson, 480\n\nU.S. at 616, 637–38. Courts prefer flexible, case-by-case approaches over rigid quota systems.\n\nSee, e.g., id. at 631–32; Paradise, 480 U.S. at 177–78 (plurality opinion), 188 (Powell, J.,\n\nconcurring); Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U.S. 421, 447 (1986).\n\n\n\n\n                                                32\n\f                        a.      Considering alternatives to explicit racial preferences\n                                and narrow tailoring of the program\n\n          An important factor is the extent to which the employer considered other ways to increase\n\ndiversity in the workplace. Cf. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81 (“[B]ecause available race-neutral\n\nalternatives were not considered, the District’s race-based hiring methods were not properly\n\ntailored to its remedial purposes.”). An employer should strive to achieve its EEO goals through\n\nless restrictive means such as minority recruitment, educational programs, and training. See\n\nDuffy v. Wolfe, 123 F.3d 1026, 1039 (8th Cir. 1997) (readily approving of efforts to increase the\n\npool of female and minority applicants through outreach and recruiting programs).            If the\n\nemployer believes these programs, alone, cannot yield acceptable results, it may consider race-\n\nconscious hiring and promotion policies. The employer should not give the race of the applicant\n\nmore “weight” than is necessary to meet the goals. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81 (“Johnson does\n\nnothing to disturb the longstanding requirement that the remedy crafted to cure a violation must\n\nbe tailored to fit the violation.” (citing Sheet Metal Workers, 478 U.S. 421)).\n\n          State’s evidence shows it had implemented its affirmative action plan after its past\n\nrecruitment and outreach plans were found lacking. Studies found that State’s efforts throughout\n\nthe 1980s to increase minority representation were not satisfactory and were progressing too\n\nslowly.     See, e.g., Underrepresentation of Minorities and Women in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared statement of Joseph Kelly, Director of Security & Int’l Rel. Issues, Nat’l Security &\n\nInt’l Affairs Div., GAO). “[T]he EEOC repeatedly pointed out that the State Department has not\n\nhad an effective affirmative action plan or program for overcoming the underrepresentation in\n\nthe Foreign Service.” Id. at 1 (Shea – 008662). The State Department adopted minority mid-\n\nlevel hiring after repeated prodding by Congress, the EEOC, and other government entities. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fgenerally Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service; The\n\nDepartment of State in the 21st Century.\n\n       As discussed supra, there may be some initial concerns over whether the program was\n\nproperly tailored. Courts have expressed concern over affirmative action plans that provide\n\npreferences to all minorities, whether or not all of those groups were underrepresented in the\n\nemployer’s workforce.      See, e.g., Alexander v. Estepp, 95 F.3d 312, 316 (4th Cir. 1996)\n\n(invalidating, under constitutional standard, affirmative action plan because it benefited all\n\nminority groups rather than merely discriminated-against African Americans). The 1990–92\n\nMLAAP waived the “certificate of need” requirement for some minority groups that were not\n\nfound to be underrepresented in the mid-levels. As explained in greater detail supra, this “over-\n\ninclusiveness” is not fatal when the 1990–92 MLAAP only set minority hiring goals where State\n\nhad found a manifest imbalance, and State had found across-the-board minority\n\nunderrepresentation in the Senior Foreign Service. The MLAAP involved case-by-case, targeted\n\nrecruitment of exceptional minority candidates, and considered the enhanced need for candidates\n\nfrom particular minority groups and backgrounds. See, e.g., Ex. 1b to Def.’s Cross-Mot.\n\n                      b.      Whether the plan is “temporary” in design and fact\n\n       Whether or not the affirmative action plan is “temporary” is another important factor to\n\nconsider. Courts favor temporary plans to attain racial balance and disfavor indefinite plans to\n\nmaintain such a balance. Plans that remain in effect long after the employer achieves the desired\n\nbalance seem less about remedying the lingering effects of past discrimination, and more about\n\npermanently providing special protections to certain groups. See, e.g., Taxman v. Board of Educ.\n\nof Tp. of Piscataway, 91 F.3d 1547, 1564 (3d Cir. 1996). Shea claims the MLAAP was not\n\ntemporary because it did not have a definite end date. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 10–11. Shea makes\n\n\n\n                                               34\n\fthis argument despite the fact that State ended the MLAAP in February 1993 and did not replace\n\nit with a similar affirmative action plan. Def.’s SMF ¶ 17; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 12 (admitting Def.’s\n\nSMF ¶ 17). Cf. Hannon v. Chater, 887 F. Supp. 1303, 1318 (N.D. Cal. 1995) (plaintiff cannot\n\nmeet burden of showing plan was not temporary when program, in fact, ended). While courts\n\nmay require definite end dates for plans that impose quotas or other rigid formulae, they typically\n\ndo not require such end dates for more flexible plans.        See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639–40\n\n(“Express assurance that a program is only temporary may be necessary if the program actually\n\nsets aside positions according to specific numbers.”).\n\n       State introduced sufficient evidence to show the MLAAP was temporary in fact and by\n\ndesign. When State originally adopted the MLAAP, it stated that its “new Mid-Level program\n\nwill be a temporary supplement to, and adjunct of, the Junior Officer Program,” and “will be\n\nappraised annually to determine whether it needs to be continued[.]” Ex. 1b to Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. 3 (Shea – 008649). In fact, the MLAAP underwent continuous monitoring to determine\n\nwhether the plan was meeting its goals, and whether race-based preferences continued to be\n\nnecessary to meet those goals. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub L. 99–33, Title I, § 152(c) (Congress\n\nrequired annual reports on the “progress being made increasing, through advancement and\n\npromotion, the numbers of members of minority groups and women in the mid-levels of the\n\nForeign Service.”); Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. (March 19, 1993 State review of the effectiveness and\n\ncontinuing need for the MLAAP); Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (indicating annual EEO audits and\n\nquarterly tracking of progress and problem areas through EEO Quarterly Reporting System).\n\nClose and periodic monitoring may show that the plan was temporary. See McNamara v. City of\n\nChicago, 867 F. Supp. 739, 752 (N.D. Ill. 1994) (where affirmative action plan reevaluated on\n\nannual basis in order “to insure flexibility and to guarantee that the rations are used only so long\n\n\n\n                                                35\n\fas they are necessary and appropriate” it satisfies second element of Weber and Johnson); See\n\nalso Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 342 (2003) (“durational requirement can be met by\n\nsunset provisions in race-conscious admissions policies and period reviews” to determine\n\nongoing need for plan). State has met its burden of production to show that the MLAAP was a\n\ntemporary measure designed to attain—not maintain—full minority representation.\n\n                      c.      Whether the plan forecloses opportunities for\n                              non-minority hiring and advancement\n\n       Another factor to consider is whether the MLAAP forecloses opportunities for non-\n\nminority hiring and advancement. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 637–38. The MLAAP did not\n\nimpose an “absolute bar” on non-minority “advancement.” Id. At all relevant times, State had a\n\ngeneral mid-level hiring program open to white males—the Mid-Level Foreign Service Career\n\nCandidate Program. See, e.g., Exs. 1A & 1B to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (1982 and 1987 Mid-Level\n\nForeign Service Career Candidate Programs). The eligibility requirements for this program were\n\nthe same as the MLAAP, except an applicant under the MLCCP needed an individual\n\ncertification of a “need for an outside hire at the grade and in the functional field…in which the\n\nperson is applying.” Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5 (March 19, 1993 Foreign Service Mid-Level\n\nHiring Program Highlights); see also Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–11\n\n(admitting in all relevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17). While the challenged affirmative\n\naction plan was in effect, several non-minority candidates were placed into mid-level positions\n\nthrough the MLCCP. See Ex. 16 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.; Def’s SMF ¶¶ 27–36; Pl.’s SMF Resp.\n\n14–16 (admitting in all relevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 27–36).\n\n       Moreover, Shea could progress to the mid-levels through the ordinary course of\n\npromotions. The MLAAP did not bar Shea from reaching the mid-levels but—by Shea’s own\n\nadmission—served to delay his ascension into the mid-levels. See Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 27–36.\n\n                                               36\n\fShea has, in fact, been promoted to the mid-levels of the Foreign Service; at the time of his\n\nComplaint, Shea was at grade FS-03, step 5. See Compl. ¶ 6(c). Several courts have approved\n\nof plans that delay, but do not bar, promotion opportunities. See, e.g., Paradise, 480 U.S. at 183\n\n(“‘Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job,’ and\n\nplainly postponement [of a promotion] imposes a lesser burden still.” (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S.\n\nat 283)) (plurality opinion); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (“[P]etitioner had no absolute entitlement\n\nto the” higher-level job. “Thus, denial of the promotion unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted\n\nexpectation on part of the petitioner. Furthermore, while petitioner in this case was denied a\n\npromotion, he retained his employment with the Agency…and remained eligible for other\n\npromotions.”); McNamara, 867 F. Supp. at 751–52 (plan avoided unnecessarily trammeling\n\ninterests of non-minorities as it delayed, not barred, promotion of non-minorities).\n\n                       d.     The nature of the plan and the extent to\n                              which it burdened non-minorities\n\n       The Court also considers the nature of the program, and the extent to which it burdened\n\nnon-minorities.   The MLAAP does “not require the discharge of white workers and their\n\nreplacement with new black hires.” Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. See also Wygant, 476 U.S. at 282–\n\n83 (expressing concern about burden layoffs place on non-minorities); Firefighters v. Stotts, 467\n\nU.S. 561, 574–76 (1984) (same). The MLAAP involved hiring goals, and in such cases:\n\n       [T]he burden to be borne by innocent individuals is diffused to a considerable\n       extent among society generally. Though hiring goals may burden some innocent\n       individuals, they simply do not impose the same kind of injury that layoffs\n       impose. Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of\n       an existing job.\n\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 283–83.       State’s minority-hiring goals were not accompanied by any\n\nminority-hiring quotas—State was not required to hire a particular number of minorities. See Ex.\n\n2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5, (March 19, 1993 Foreign Service Mid-Level Hiring Program\n\n                                                37\n\fHighlights: “Our hiring goal each year for the affirmative action mid-level program has been\n\nabout twenty. As you will observe by the hiring statistics…we have not come close to our\n\ntarget.”). At no time did State bind itself to hire a certain number of minorities each year; State\n\nnoted that it was focused the quality of its minority candidates, not the quantity it could hire. See\n\nEx. 1b to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (“Success will be measured by the quality of the future mid-level\n\ncandidates hired, and their subsequent performance in the Foreign Service, rather than by\n\nwhether or not specific numerical hiring goals are met each year[.]”).\n\n       State thoroughly vetted minority candidates, taking far more than thier race into account.\n\nThe MLAAP required “pre-certification based on a file review, an oral assessment conducted by\n\nthe staff of the Board of Examiners and the normal background investigation, medical\n\nexamination and Final Review to determine suitability for appointment to the Foreign Service.”\n\nEx. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5. The MLAAP candidate must have had a “bachelor’s degree from\n\nan accredited college or university;” “six additional years of professional level education and/or\n\nprofessional work experience of which three years must have been in an area related to the\n\nprospective Foreign Service functional field;” and “supervisory/managerial skills.” Id. The\n\nMLAAP did not assign a set “point” value to minority status.\n\n       The MLAAP was “identical” to the more general mid-level hiring program, except that\n\nmembership in a minority group substituted for an individual certificate of need. Id. Once those\n\nqualified minority candidates applied, they were subject to the same rigorous process as non-\n\nminority applicants. See Ex. 7 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Nov. 1990 State document describing the\n\nrequirements and application process for both the MLCCP and MLAAP). Cf. Johnson, 480 U.S.\n\nat 638 (approving of plans that “consider[] race along with other criteria”); Hammon, 826 F.3d at\n\n79–80 (agreeing with Johnson’s approval of a “‘moderate, flexible, case-by-case approach’” and\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fstressing need for sufficient “screening considerations” to avoid “‘mere bling hiring by the\n\nnumbers’” (quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636–37)). 9\n\n        While State was interested in increasing the number of minority Foreign Service officers,\n\nit strongly emphasized the quality and accomplishments of its minority recruits. The 1990–92\n\nMLAAP plan document says that “State is committed to forging a workforce that fully represents\n\nthe American diversity without sacrificing excellence.” Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 61 (Shea –\n\n00140). The 1990–92 MLAAP aimed to “emphasize selective recruiting of potential candidates\n\non a one-by-one basis[.]” Id. The refined plan concentrated “on quality candidates who are\n\nunquestionably successful in their current careers and who have been individually recommended\n\nby people who know both the candidate and the requirements of the Foreign Service.” Id. This\n\nwas done despite State’s knowledge that it was “dramatically reduc[ing]” the “number of\n\n[minority] applications processed.” Id.\n\n        State proffers evidence that it screened out many interested minority candidates who did\n\nnot meet the requirements. Id. State submits evidence that it did not place at least two eligible\n\nminority applicants in mid-level positions after those candidates applied. Decl. of Alina Eldred\n\n¶¶ 4–11. This happened despite the fact that State did not meet its minority hiring goals at any\n\ntime during the MLAAP. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 19 (“Despite the expressed goal of hiring 20 mid-\n\n9\n  Shea argues that the MLAAP is not flexible—“race acted as an absolute bar to participation in the MLAAP.” Pl.’s\nMot. Summ. J. 5. Shea is technically correct that he was ineligible to apply through the MLAAP because of his\nrace. See id. at 4–7. Shea, however, had an opportunity to apply for direct mid-level placement through the\nMLCCP, which was substantially identical to the MLAAP. See Ex. 7 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (describing, in detail,\nrequirements of both programs). At times, State has spoken of them as if they were two parts of the same program:\n        The Mid-Level Foreign Service Career Candidate Program is designed to hire office candidates at\n        the ranks of FP–3, 2 and 1 to supplement the number of Career Foreign Service Officers already in\n        those grades, in accordance with the needs of the Foreign Service. The need is either specific—\n        for an offer at the grade and in the cone which an applicant is seeking to enter; or general—for\n        minority group members under the Department’s Affirmative Action Program to achieve\n        greater representativeness un the Foreign Service.\nId. at Shea – 3448 (emphasis added). Shea’s argument trades heavily on semantic differences—i.e., it doesn’t\nmatter that I was eligible for the MLCCP, because I was ineligible for the MLAAP—rather than focusing on the true\nnature of the program, and considering whether it unfairly shut out or burdened non-minorities.\n\n                                                       39\n\flevel minorities per year…, less than 6 minorities per year were placed in the mid-levels of the\n\nForeign Service, totaling approximately 29 minorities (male and female) during the five-year\n\nperiod of the MLAAP’s existence.”); Pl.’s SMF Resp. 13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 19).\n\n        State has met its burden of production that it properly tailored its affirmative action plan\n\nso that it would not unnecessarily trammel the interests of non-minorities.\n\n        C.       Shea’s Attempt to Prove that the Affirmative Action Plan is Invalid\n\n        With State meeting its burden of production, Shea must offer sufficient, potentially\n\nadmissible 10 evidence that the MLAAP was unlawful—that State’s proffered evidence is not\n\nworthy of credence and State illegally discriminated against white males. If Shea fails to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact with admissible evidence, State will prevail. If there is a failure of\n\nproof by Shea, State does not have to affirmatively and ultimately prove that the MLAAP is\n\nlawful. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 627 (employer’s burden is one of production, not of ultimate\n\nproof); Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 885 (1990) (“Rule 56 does not require the\n\nmoving party to negate the elements of the nonmoving party’s case.”).\n\n                 1.       Shea’s Calculations of the Rate of Minority Representation\n\n        Shea’s primary evidence is that State’s numbers show that “minorities overall were\n\nactually overrepresented in the mid-level grades…by September 30, 1989.” Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J.\n\n3 (emphasis in original). Shea states, “It is self-evident that when minorities are overrepresented,\n\nthe job category is not one that is ‘traditionally segregated.’ …[A] program is not remedial when\n\n10\n  A “party opposing summary judgment may only rely on evidence ‘capable of being converted into admissible\nevidence at trial’ to ‘survive summary judgment.’” A.N.S.W.E.R. Coal. v. District of Columbia, __ F. Supp. 2d __,\n2012 WL 5974030, *14 n.5 (D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2012) (quoting Greer, 505 F.3d at 1315). Evidence that may not be\nadmissible at trial, but is capable of being converted into admissible evidence, includes (for example) sworn\naffidavits that themselves could run afoul of the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause, but could be “converted”\ninto admissible evidence by having the affiant testify at trial or in a deposition. See id. (citing Gleklen v. Dem.\nCongressional Campaign Comm., Inc., 199 F.3d 1365, 1369 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).\nWith this in mind, when the Court speaks of “admissible evidence,” it is really using that phrase as a shorthand for\n“evidence that is admissible or capable of being converted into admissible evidence.”\n\n                                                        40\n\fthere is no underrepresentation to be remedied, and [] it is impossible to properly tailor a\n\nremedial program when there is no underrepresentation to remedy.” Id.

Shea\n\ndescribes his method thusly: First, he took the “numbers of FSOs at each grade, broken down by\n\nrace and sex, as of September 30, 1989” from State’s FY 1990–92 FY MLAAP document. Id. at\n\n12–13. See also Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (Shea’s edited copy of the plan, with additional\n\ncharts created by Shea). Second, he added “the numbers for male and female officers of each\n\nrace…to determine totals for any given race at any given grade.” Id. at 13. He then used the\n\nNCLF Public Administrator figures, available at page 47a of the plan, as his comparator group.\n\nId. (citing Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. at 47a (Shea – 00177)). Shea again combined the\n\ngender-specific NCLF data to provide one total number for each racial group. Id. at 14.\n\n       Shea then performed a series of calculations comparing white representation with\n\nminority representation.   He concludes that “whites were underrepresented in the Foreign\n\nService mid-level grades,” as “[w]hites comprised 85.58 of the Foreign Service mid-level\n\nofficers” but “comprised 86.1 percent of the Public Administrator” comparator pool. Id. at 15.\n\nShea then performed a series of calculations of white versus minority group representation at\n\nvarious mid-level grades, concluding that his numbers show a vast majority of minority groups\n\nwere not underrepresented at the mid-level grades. Id. at 15–27. He did not use a commonly-\n\naccepted method, such as the standard deviation or the “Z statistic” method, to explain the\n\nstatistical significance of his findings. See Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S.\n\n299, 308 n.14 (1977) (standard deviation method); Frazier v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 851 F.2d\n\n1447, 1451–52 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (Z statistic method).\n\n\n\n\n                                               41\n\f               2.      How Shea’s Analysis Differs From State’s\n\n       Congress, the GAO, and State had long railed against the overrepresentation of white\n\nmales in the Foreign Service, especially at its mid- and senior-levels. See supra Parts I.A., III.B.\n\nBut Shea shows—using State’s own numbers—that whites were actually underrepresented in the\n\nForeign Service mid-levels. See Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3. What explains this difference? Shea has\n\nwidened the comparator pool.       Shea concedes that white males were overrepresented, but\n\ndismisses this fact as “irrelevant.” Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply. 7. To Shea, the relevant question isn’t\n\nwhether white males are overrepresented, but whether whites as a whole are overrepresented.\n\nState provided numbers broken down by both race and gender, see generally Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot., but Shea combined the gender figures for each race to determine the rates of\n\nrepresentation by race only, rather than by race and gender, see Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 12–27.\n\nInstead of comparing white males to white women, black males, et cetera, Shea simply compares\n\nwhites to blacks, Asians, Hispanics, et cetera. When the numbers are looked at this way, Shea\n\nargues, one finds that whites are actually underrepresented in the mid-levels, and thus the\n\nMLAAP cannot have any legitimate remedial purpose. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3, 12–27.\n\n       State raises questions about Shea’s analysis, claiming Shea “manipulated the data in his\n\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities by combining the population of White male employees\n\n(who were significantly over-represented) with White female employees (who were grossly\n\nunder-represented).” Def.’s Cross-Mot. 14. State argues that since “the initial Congressional\n\nmandate (comparing White males with all other race/gender groups)” and State had\n\n“implemented programs to address the racial/gender disparities,” Shea’s “decision to focus on\n\nrace alone makes no sense, other than as an attempt to ‘smooth out’ the difference and thereby\n\n‘create’ an entirely new parameter of facts to support his position.” Id. at 14–15.\n\n\n\n                                                42\n\f       State’s position has some support.        First, the evidence suggests that Congress was\n\nconcerned specifically with white male overrepresentation, rather than the overrepresentation of\n\nwhites generally. See, e.g., 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 99–33; 1988–89 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204;\n\nUnderrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service—State Department:\n\nHearing Before the Subcomm. on the Civil Service of the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil\n\nService, 101st Cong. (1989). Second, State had separate programs aimed at increasing female\n\nrepresentation. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 4; Pl.’s SMF Resp. (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 4). Third, courts\n\nhave been suspicious of efforts to distort the data by inflating or artificially restricting the\n\ncomparator groups. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636 (“[H]ad the Plan simply calculated imbalances\n\nin all categories according to the proportion of women in the area labor pool, and then directed\n\nthat hiring be governed solely by those figures, its validity fairly could be called into question.”);\n\nSmith v. Virginia Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672, 677 (4th Cir. 1996) (“An inflated pool can\n\nundermine the validity of a statistical study to determine imbalances.”); Reynolds v. Sheet Metal\n\nWorkers Local 102, 498 F. Supp. 952, 967–69 (D.D.C. 1980) (questioning relevance and\n\nsignificance of statistical analyses that inflate number of minorities in comparator pools).\n\n       It is not readily apparent from Shea’s summary judgment motion why he combines males\n\nand females to create the relevant comparator groups. This is the Court’s best guess, based on\n\nscattered comments from Shea’s briefs: Since the MLAAP is not open to white women, the\n\nunderrepresentation of white women is not relevant to justifying the MLAAP.                Since the\n\nMLAAP excluded Shea because of his race, rather than his gender, the pertinent question is\n\nwhether whites—rather than white males—were overrepresented in the mid-levels of the Foreign\n\nService. In his opposition brief, Shea does not fully address State’s challenges to using whites as\n\nthe comparator pool. He seems to misunderstand State’s argument, stating: “The defense\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\femphasis on how ‘grossly’ overrepresented white males were in 1987 seems part of an effort to\n\nconvince the court to add an element to a Title VII claim asserting a lawful [affirmative action\n\nplan]: that the plaintiff was part of a group that was under-represented in the workforce.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n & Reply 8. State responds that it “has never alleged that the Plaintiff ‘lacks standing’ to\n\nraise a claim merely because he is a member of an over-represented group in the workplace,” and\n\nfinds no explanation as to why Shea combined white males and females in his analysis. Def.’s\n\nReply 5. The Court agrees that it is not entirely clear why Shea chooses this comparator pool.\n\n       What should be clear, however, is that Shea is engaging in a new statistical analysis. He\n\nis changing the comparator group that State used to justify its affirmative action plan, and\n\nrecalculating rates of representation based on Shea’s preferred comparator groups. State raises\n\nserious concerns about Shea’s methods and use of comparator pools. Without deciding whether\n\nState’s criticisms are valid, the Court notes that the questions they raise are serious and have not\n\nbeen adequately addressed by Shea, as the following analysis will show.\n\n               3.      Shea Conducts a Statistical Analysis He is Not Competent to Perform\n\n       Essentially, Shea performs a statistical analysis of State’s data to show that there was, in\n\nfact, no “manifest imbalance” in the Foreign Service. Whether or not Shea needs an expert to\n\nperform this analysis, it is clear that Shea has not adequately explained his methods or\n\ndemonstrated the statistical significance of his results. His analysis of State’s racial over- and\n\nunderrepresentation is not, and is not capable of being transformed into, admissible evidence.\n\n                       a.     Courts demand some evidence of the statistical significance\n                              of statistics, often presented via an expert witness\n\n       The case law in this circuit overwhelmingly finds that this kind of analysis requires proof\n\nas to its statistical significance. In Frazier v. Consolidated Rail Corporation, 851 F.2d 1447,\n\n1450 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the D.C. Circuit made the fundamental statement that while the use of\n\n                                                44\n\fstatistical analysis has “become routine” and “well accepted” in discrimination cases, “[a]\n\nstatistical calculation relies on a number of underlying assumptions, the validity of which can\n\noften be assessed only by those with experience in the field.” In Frazier, the plaintiffs did not\n\nuse “an expert to explain the statistical calculations to the district court,” but submitted raw data\n\nabout disparate treatment and “several results of numerical calculation performed by counsel.”\n\nId. “These calculations were all done according to widely known methods previously reported in\n\nother discrimination cases, regulations and commentaries” and included a “Z statistic”\n\ncalculation to explain the statistical significance of the results. Id. While not deciding whether\n\nexpert witnesses are required for this kind of analysis, the D.C. Circuit stressed the importance of\n\nverifying the significance of the statistics, and upheld the district court’s evidentiary findings:\n\n       We are not prepared to say that the Z statistic calculation is so simple and straight\n       forward that an expert is never required to explain it to a finder of fact. Nor do\n       we wish to be understood as holding that an expert is always required. We leave\n       both possibilities open because it would be impossible to anticipate the impact of\n       this theory upon every conceivable factual situation. We believe that in the\n       factual context of this case, the district court made a valid finding that the\n       plaintiffs’ proffered statistics were not sufficiently presented to make out a prima\n       facie case of adverse impact.\n\nId. at 1453.\n\n       Courts in this Circuit have continued to require evidence of statistical significance—often\n\nprovided by experts—before giving any weight to proffered statistics. In Kline v. Springer, 602\n\nF. Supp. 2d 234, 238–39 (D.D.C. 2009), the district court succinctly disregarded plaintiff’s\n\nassertions about the underrepresentation of white female underrepresentation. The Court noted\n\nthat even if the plaintiff’s “numbers were properly supported by record evidence they would not\n\nbe enough. Without additional context, such as correctly defined pools, no reasonable juror\n\ncould infer a background of reverse discrimination…from the bare numbers.” Id. at 239. In\n\nHorvath v. Thompson, 329 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2004), a pro se plaintiff in a reverse gender\n\n                                                  45\n\fdiscrimination suit tried to introduce self-prepared statistics showing a manifest imbalance of\n\nwhite men in the workplace.               The Court found that plaintiff’s numbers regarding the\n\nunderrepresentation of males were “simply irrelevant,” “absent a showing of their\n\nsignificance[.]” Id. at 11. In that case, the plaintiff failed to introduce sufficient evidence about\n\n“the pool of available and qualified applicants,” and “any measure of ‘the probability that the\n\noutcome of a statistical analysis would have occurred by chance.’” Id. (quoting Segar v. Smith,\n\n738 F.2d 1249, 1282 (D.C. Cir. 1984)). In Thomas v. Chao, 65 Fed. Appx. 321, 324 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2003), the D.C. Circuit found that the “District Court was correct to exclude from evidence the\n\nlist of employers identified by race and sex, and witness’ observations about the race and sex of\n\nemployees, in the absence of an expert who could testify that the alleged underrepresentation\n\nwas statistically insignificant.”\n\n                           b.       Shea’s calculations cannot withstand the rigorous scrutiny\n                                    courts in this circuit apply to statistics in Title VII cases\n\n         The infirmity of Shea’s lay statistics is further emphasized by the rigorous, exacting\n\nanalysis courts in this circuit have applied to this kind of statistical evidence. See, e.g., Berger v.\n\nIron Workers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1411–23 (D.C. Cir. 1988), on\n\nrehearing 852 F.2d 619; McReynolds, 349 F. Supp. 2d at 8–28.11 Looking at Shea’s analysis,\n\nthis Court has several fundamental, threshold questions. Why does Shea continue to use the\n\n1980 numbers for the relevant comparator pool, see Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3, 12–14, even though\n\nthe GAO report containing those numbers explicitly disclaimed their reliability, and more recent\n\nnumbers were available? See Ex. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 21 (Shea – 008695). Why is it\n\nappropriate for Shea to combine while males and while females, and recalculate the\n\nunderrepresentation figures by race only? Isn’t Shea simply inflating the comparator group to\n\n11\n  This presents another way to look at this issue: In comparison with the detailed, searching analysis used in Berger\nand McReynolds, it is clear that Shea’s statistical analysis—expert or not—cannot pass muster.\n\n                                                         46\n\fdiminish the rate of white male overrepresentation? How, and why, has Shea recalculated the\n\nrates of underrepresentation?       Has he done so pursuant to standard, generally accepted\n\nprocedures? Are his results statistically significant? What is the error rate? How does Shea\n\nmeasure statistical significance and error rates?\n\n       The Court needs to answer these questions before it can determine the relevance,\n\nreliability, and probative value of Shea’s calculations—and thus their admissibility. See Frazier,\n\n851 F.2d at 1452 (“Statistical comparisons performed on data in discrimination cases are not\n\nprobative of anything without support from an underlying statistical theory.”). Shea does not\n\nadequately answer these questions. “[T]he statistics must be made meaningful to the finder of\n\nfact in order to permit the plaintiff[] to carry [his] burden of showing that [his] statistics are\n\nsignificant.” Id. at 1453. Even if Shea did not necessarily need an expert to conduct his\n\nanalysis—as left open by Frazier, 851 F.2d at 1453—this Court finds that plaintiff’s proffered\n\nstatistics were not sufficiently presented to withstand the scrutiny this Court must apply in\n\ndetermining their relevance and reliability, cf. id.\n\n                       c.      Shea’s analysis is not as simple and modest as he claims\n\n       Shea claims that his analysis simply relies on numbers provided in State’s own\n\ndocuments. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 9–10, 13, 25. A simple examination of plaintiff’s Exhibit\n\n2 shows that he is not merely pointing to State’s analysis and why it cannot support State’s\n\nposition. Instead he combines different sets of State’s numbers—merging the figures for males\n\nand females—and recalculating overrepresentation rates based on what Shea thinks should be the\n\nrelevant comparator. See Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (plaintiff-created charts at pages 11, 12,\n\n13, 15, 16, 17). He, in essence, changes the comparator groups without a sufficient explanation\n\nfor the change, and without a background in the kinds of “pools” analysis frequently done by\n\n\n\n                                                    47\n\fstatisticians in Title VII cases. See, e.g., Whitacre v. Davey, 890 F.2d 1168, 1172 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1989) (requiring “evidence of the pool of available and qualified applicants” before proffered\n\nstatistics may be considered adequate); Palmer, 815 F. 2d at 91 (discussing “pools” analysis in\n\nTitle VII cases); Segar, 738 F.2d at 1278 (same); McReynolds, 349 F. Supp. 2d at 9 (same).\n\n       Shea claims that, in so recalculating the overrepresentation numbers, he is doing simple\n\nmath—that he does not need any advanced degrees or specialized knowledge to add, subtract,\n\nmultiply, and divide. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 16–17, 25–31. Certainly, a big part of what most\n\nstatisticians do boils down to simple math. But statisticians are not experts because they are\n\nparticularly adept at math—the Court suspects that many use performance-enhancing calculators.\n\nStatisticians are experts because they know which numbers to use, and what functions to apply to\n\neach set of numbers. In this case, the relevant expertise is not simply applying elementary\n\nschool-level math to sets of numbers found within the defendant’s documents. It is knowing, out\n\nof the different sets of numbers spread throughout State’s reports, which sets of numbers to\n\ncompare and how to compare them. It is being able to explain whether a disparity between\n\nwhites and minorities is statistically significant, and whether the results have accounted for\n\n“noise” that may skew the numbers. See, e.g., Berger, 843 F.2d at 1411–23; Frazier, 851 F.2d at\n\n1452; McReynolds, 349 F. Supp. 2d at 8–28.\n\n                      d.     Shea is not qualified to offer expert or lay opinion testimony\n\n       Shea’s numbers are irrelevant without some explanation of their significance. Shea\n\nmight need an expert to opine on the statistical significance of the recalculated\n\nunderrepresentation figures. See Chao, 65 Fed. Appx. at 324. Without even considering Shea’s\n\nqualifications, Shea could not provide expert testimony because he did not disclose his\n\ntestimony—per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26—by the deadlines imposed by the Court.\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\fSee Revised Scheduling Order 2, July 6, 2010, ECF No. 84 (setting expert deadline as September\n\n30, 2010). Shea had ample opportunity to designate an expert, and was aware of the relevant\n\ndeadlines when he asked for—and received—extensions of the expert disclosure and discovery\n\ndeadlines. See, e.g., Minute Entry, Sept. 22, 2009; Minute Entry, Dec. 18, 2009; Pl.’s Mot. for\n\nDiscovery Extension, June 28, 2010, ECF No. 81. Shea’s unexcused and inexcusable failure to\n\ntimely designate an expert per the Court’s deadlines disqualifies him as an “expert,” and makes\n\nhis calculations and conclusions inadmissible to the extent they require expert testimony.\n\n        Shea cannot present “lay” opinion testimony as to the statistical significance of his\n\nfindings. Such testimony typically involves disclosed experts and is thus not amenable to lay\n\nexpert analysis. See Fed. R. Evid. 701(c) (forbidding lay opinion testimony “based on scientific,\n\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702”). Lay opinion testimony\n\n“‘is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the\n\nwitness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of\n\na fact in issue.’” United States v. Williams, 212 F.3d 1305, 1390 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\npre-2011 amendment wording of Fed. R. Evid. 701 12 ).                 Shea’s opinions on the rates of\n\noverrepresentation are not based on his own perceptions and feelings, or his personal knowledge\n\nand experience. He has not attained “specialized knowledge…through experience rather than\n\nscientific or technical training,” and is not testifying “based solely on personal experience with\n\nthe case at issue.” Armenian Assembly of Am. v. Cafesijan, 746 F. Supp. 2d 55, 65 (D.D.C.\n\n2010). Therefore, his testimony therefore would not be admissible as “lay opinion” or “lay\n\nexpert” testimony under Rule 701. Cf. Barnes v. District of Columbia, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2013\n\nWL 541148, *6–*9 (D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2013) (discussing admissibility of lay opinion testimony).\n\n\n12\n  The 2011 changes made to Rule 701 were “intended to be stylistic only” and were not intended “to change any\nresult in any ruling on evidence admissibility.” Fed. R. Evid. 701 advisory committee’s note.\n\n                                                     49\n\f                           e.       Even if no expert is needed, Shea has failed to adequately explain\n                                    his methods and the statistical significance of his results\n\n         Even if this kind analysis would not require an expert, per se, Shea has failed to properly\n\ndefend his analysis. “Statistical comparisons performed on data in discrimination cases are not\n\nprobative of anything without support from an underlying statistical theory.” Frazier, 851 F.2d\n\nat 1452. Simply presenting numbers and comparisons to the Court is not sufficient. See\n\nSaunders v. White, 191 F. Supp. 2d 96, 133 (D.D.C. 2002); Hatcher–Capers v. Haley, 786 F.\n\nSupp. 1054, 1063–64 (D.D.C. 1992). The party offering the statistics must articulate how the\n\ndata should be interpreted and why it supports the party’s position. Saunders, 191 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n133. The party must “demonstrate that the data []he offers is statistically significant,” Haley, 786\n\nF. Supp. at 1063, and explain how the numbers reflect discrimination (or a lack thereof) rather\n\nthan, for example, “incomprehensive statistical treatment, varying levels of qualifications among\n\napplicants, errors in definition or groups, inappropriate sampling methods, errors in\n\nmeasurement, or even clerical and computational errors,” Frazier, 851 F.2d at 1452.\n\n         As in Frazier, id. at 1453, Shea’s statistics are not “sufficiently presented;” Shea cannot\n\nexplain his methods and assumptions such that his statistics are “meaningful to the trier of fact in\n\norder to permit” him to carry his burden of “showing that [his] statistics are significant.” 13 He\n\ninflates the comparator pool without an adequate justification for using this larger pool. He\n\nprovides no explanation of whether his recalculated rates of overrepresentation are statistically\n\nsignificant, per any generally accepted measure. He does not even attempt a standard deviation\n\nor “Z statistic” calculation. He does not even reference—let alone explain how he relied on—\n\n“widely known methods previously reported in other discrimination cases, regulations, and\n\n\n\n13\n  From the D.C. Circuit’s description, the non-expert statistics Frazier found to be insufficiently presented appear to\nbe much more detailed than the analysis offered by Shea. 851 F.2d at 1450–54.\n\n                                                         50\n\fcommentaries.” Id. at 1450. He gives the Court none of the information it would need to make a\n\nthreshold determination of the relevance, reliability, and admissibility of his amateur statistics.\n\n       Courts often give pro se litigants more slack than represented parties—for example,\n\nCourts may be more generous in construing pro se complaints when considering a motion to\n\ndismiss. See generally Pettaway v. United States, 390 A.2d 981, 984 (D.C. 1978) (“We have a\n\nduty to be indulgent of pro se pleadings.”). This generosity does not extend, however, to\n\nallowing Shea to provide his own opinions where expert testimony is needed, or subjecting\n\nShea’s statistical methods to far less scrutiny than any other litigant would face.\n\n                       f.      State is not required to offer expert testimony to meet its burden\n\n       Shea argues that it is unfair to ask him to use experts to show that a manifest imbalance\n\ndid not justify the MLAAP, but not require State to use experts to show that there was such a\n\nmanifest imbalance. Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 7–8, 31–35. Requiring State—as a condition of\n\nmeeting its burden of production—to retain outside experts to verify that State designed the\n\nMLAAP to correct for a manifest imbalance would severely undermine the allocation of burdens\n\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas and Johnson. Johnson, read liberally, might suggest that the\n\nmere production of an affirmative action plan could meet the employer’s burden under\n\nMcDonnell Douglas. See 480 U.S. at 627 (“Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that\n\nrace or sex has been taken into account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts\n\nto the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the\n\nemployer’s decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's justification is\n\npretextual and the plan is invalid.”). State has done more than simply point to its affirmative\n\naction plan—it has provided evidence indicating its plan is lawful, justified by a need to remedy\n\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fa manifest imbalance, and properly tailored to those ends.           However, by submitting this\n\nevidence, State does not admit that it “carr[ies] the burden of proving the validity of the plan.\n\nThe burden of proving its invalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 627–28.\n\n       The Court admits that the law is not precise on exactly how much evidence an employer\n\nmust offer to defend its affirmative action plan. Cf. 2 LINDEMANN, GROSSMAN & WEIRICH,\n\nEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW 2506–07 (“On the fact-specific issue as to what evidence is\n\nneeded to prove discrimination sufficient to undertake affirmative action, however, the lower\n\ncourts have not taken a consistent approach.”). Nevertheless, wherever the exact location of the\n\n“line” is, the Court is confident (as discussed supra in Part III.A.) that State’s proffered evidence\n\ngoes far beyond that line. Under current precedent—Johnson and its progeny—an employer is\n\nnot necessarily required to provide expert testimony to meet its burden of production.\n\n       The reports from the State Department, congressional subcommittees, and the GAO—\n\ncreated during the normal course of business—could be sufficient to establish the required\n\n“manifest imbalance” and “predicate of discrimination.”           See supra Part.III.B. (detailing\n\nevidence introduced by State). To authenticate and discuss the content of these reports, the\n\ndefendant would not necessarily need expert witnesses, or treat its party witnesses as such. See\n\nBarnes, __ F. Supp. 2d __, 2013 WL 541148 at *7 (defendant’s contemporaneously-created\n\nreports on the rates of prisoner overdetentions “are not expert reports,” but “business records—\n\ncreated not in anticipation of litigation, but in the normal course of business—that do not require\n\na Rule 26(a)(2) designated expert to authenticate them”); cf. National R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\n\nRailway Express, LLC, 268 F.R.D. 211, 214–15 (D. Md. 2010) (party employees may be\n\nrequired to provide expert disclosures if employee witness renders opinions on matters outside\n\nthe normal scope of their employment or the employer retains or specially employs them to\n\n\n\n                                                 52\n\ftestify). As properly authenticated business records, these reports and documents could justify\n\nthe MLAAP without the need for experts.\n\n                 4.       Shea’s Evidence that the MLAAP Forecloses Advancement\n                          Opportunities for Non-Minorities\n\n        Shea argues that the MLAAP, in effect, forecloses advancement opportunities for non-\n\nminorities. Shea claims he “was not aware of any mid-level hiring program that non-minorities\n\nwere eligible for when [he] applied for a job with the Foreign Service in 1990[.]” Pl.’s Opp’n to\n\nDef.’s Second Mot. Reconsideration 41, Apr. 12, 2011, ECF No. 95. While Shea’s subjective\n\nknowledge of the MLCCP may be relevant to mitigation of damages, it is not relevant in\n\nconsidering the legality of the MLAAP, as it is undisputed that such a general mid-level hiring\n\nprogram existed. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 9–12, 22; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 9–\n\n12, 22). Nevertheless, Shea claims that the MLCCP would have done him no good, as State was\n\nnot issuing certificates of need for his particular area of expertise. Shea says that no certificates\n\nof need were issued between January 1990 and the date he began with State, May 31, 1992. Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n & Reply 35. Shea continues, “The first mid-level white hiring comes on October 19,\n\n1992 – after I had started my employment with State.” Id. In support of this position, Shea cites\n\ndefense exhibit 16 (ECF No. 128-18), a chart entitled “Mid-Level Hiring 1990 to 1994.” This\n\nchart shows that State first hired Caucasian as a mid-level on October 19, 1992. 14\n\n\n\n14\n  This, of course, does not mean there were no white mid-level hires prior to October 1992. Construing this chart,\nthe Court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Shea, and does feel the need to address whether there were\nnon-minority mid-level hires prior to this date.\nElsewhere State argues, “Due to the passage of time cause by Plaintiff’s nine-year delay in bringing this action and\nthe resulting loss of records, Defendant is unable to tell if any certificates of need were issued by the State\nDepartment in the fiscal years 1990 and 1991.” Def.’s Cross-Mot. 26 n.16. Since this is merely the ipse dixit of\ncounsel, unsupported by a sworn affidavit or admissible evidence, the Court ignores this argument entirely and\nfocuses on what can actually be shown by the evidence. See A.N.S.W.E.R. Coal. v. District of Columbia, __ F.\nSupp. 2d. __, 2012 WL 5974030, *14 (D.D.C. Nov. 29, 2012) (unsworn statements of counsel, unsupported by the\nevidence, is evidence of nothing at the summary judgment stage) (citing Schoch v. First Fidelity Bancorporation,\n912 F.2d 654, 657 (3d Cir. 1990); Int’l Distrb. Corp. v. Am. Dist. Tel. Co., 569 F.2d 136, 139 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).\n\n                                                        53\n\f       This chart does not show that no certificates of need were being issued—or that it was\n\nimpossible to receive such a certificate—when Shea applied.              Certificates of need, as\n\nprerequisites to applying for a mid-level position, must be issued some time before an applicant\n\nis hired. Exs. 1A & 1B to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (1982 and 1987 Mid-Level Foreign Service Career\n\nCandidate Programs). Consider the case of Patricia Haslach, whom Shea cites as the non-\n\nminority candidate hired on October 19, 1992. Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 35. According to a letter\n\nfrom Haslach to State, Haslach inquired about the MLCCP as early as December 12, 1990. Ex.\n\n17 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Shea – 07538). On January 10, 1991, Haslach applied for a mid-level\n\nposition, id.; apparently it took approximately 22 months for her to be hired at State, see Def.’s\n\nSMF ¶¶ 28, 30–32; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 14–15 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 28, 30–32). This shows\n\nthat simply because no white mid-levels were hired until a few months after Shea entered State,\n\nthis does not mean no certificates of need were issued until after Shea entered State.\n\n       Shea next cites a November 30, 1992, memorandum sent to the State Department\n\nDirector General titled, “Minority Recruitment and Hiring.” Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply, ECF\n\nNo. 123-1. The memo states that “at present,” State was then “able to certify mid-level need for\n\nadmin, econ, and science officers at the 02 and 03 levels, and consular officers at the 02 levels.”\n\nEx. 1 to Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply (Shea – 03765). To Shea this means State was not issuing\n\ncertificates for consular officers at grade FS-3—the position he would have been interested in\n\nand qualified for—and therefore he was effectively shut out of the MLCCP. See Pl.’s Opp’n &\n\nReply 37. However, this conclusion does not follow from the memorandum. First, the memo\n\nonly concerns certificates of need as of November 1992, and says absolutely nothing about the\n\navailability of consular certificates prior to that date. In fact, prior to November 1992, State did\n\napprove of certificates of need for FS-03 consular officers. See Ex. 10 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (on\n\n\n\n                                                54\n\fMay 14, 1992, approving of FS-03 consular certificates of need) (Shea – 07372). This May 1992\n\nState document undermines Shea’s interpretation of the November 1992 memorandum—simply\n\nbecause FS-03 consular certificates were not available in November 1992 does not mean they\n\nwere not available earlier, while Shea was applying for a position.\n\n       Overall, Shea does not present sufficient evidence to infer that was completely shut out of\n\nthe MLCCP or did not have an opportunity to reach the mid-levels. By his own admission, Shea\n\nnever inquired about the MLCCP, requested a certificate of need, or applied to the program.\n\nDef.’s SMF ¶ 22; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 22); Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Second\n\nMot. Reconsideration 41. Applying for, and being rejected from, mid-level placement would be\n\nthe clearest evidence that he was not eligible for mid-level placement. At this point, Shea’s\n\nevidence is speculative at best and not sufficient to overcome State’s evidentiary proffer.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The role of a district court is to ascertain and apply the law as it is, not as the Court thinks\n\nit should be.     This Court finds that the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Johnson v.\n\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, 480 U.S. 616 (1987)—as it has been interpreted\n\nand applied in this Circuit—provides the controlling standard for analyzing Title VII challenges\n\nof affirmative action plans. Under Johnson, after the plaintiff has made a prima facie claim of\n\nracial discrimination, the defendant must only meet a burden of production—not persuasion—\n\nthat it acted pursuant to a legal affirmative action plan. The ultimate persuasive burden is, at all\n\ntimes, on the plaintiff to prove that the affirmative action plan was unlawful.            Under this\n\nstandard, Shea has failed to provide sufficient, admissible evidence that State’s affirmative action\n\nplan was not justified by a manifest imbalance in the workforce or properly tailored to achieve\n\nremedial goals.     In particular, Shea’s amateur statistics regarding the rates of minority\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\frepresentation in the Foreign Service would be inadmissible, as Shea provides no evidence as to\n\nthe statistical significance of his results. Since Shea cannot prove an essential element of his\n\nclaim, and has had a full and fair opportunity obtain relevant discovery, the State Department is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Shea’s remaining claim.\n\n         For Shea, this may be a less than satisfying end to this long-running case. This Court is,\n\nin some ways, sympathetic. The Court wonders why it is harder to challenge an affirmative\n\naction plan under Title VII than under the Constitution. When challenging affirmative action\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, strict scrutiny applies and the defendant has the ultimate\n\nburden of explaining why it was necessary to treat people differently based on their race. But\n\nwhen the challenge is under Title VII, we make the plaintiff ultimately prove that race-based\n\ndiscrimination is illegal. 15 The Court questions the wisdom of looking to legislative history to\n\ncreate a textual ambiguity, rather than resolve one—carving out exceptions from a clear mandate\n\nnot to discriminate because we imagine what legislators would have done, rather than focus on\n                                  16\nwhat they actually did.                Our affirmative action jurisprudence—both statutory and\n\nconstitutional—operates under the assumption that unambiguous mandates not to discriminate\n\nbased on race somehow apply with less force to members of the “majority.”\n\n\n\n\n15\n  See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626–27 (providing Title VII McDonnell Douglas burden shifting standard for analyzing\naffirmative action plans); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 273 (providing constitutional strict scrutiny standard for analyzing\naffirmative action plans; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 480 U.S. at 627 n.6 (majority opinion clarifying that statutory\nprocedure for analyzing affirmative action plans is indeed different from the constitutional test); Stewart, 948 F.\nSupp. at 1093 (“The standard for determining whether affirmative relief is justified under Title VII is less stringent\nthan under the Constitution.”).\n16\n   Our affirmative action jurisprudence has its origins in the backwards idea that the “spirit” of a law somehow\ntrumps its plain and unambiguous letter. In Weber and Johnson, the Supreme Court somehow found—in plain\nlanguage barring racial discrimination—an out to give racial preferences to minority groups. Certainly, the Court\nthought, it would be absurd for a law barring racial discrimination not to allow some. See generally Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 657–77 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The Court is reminded of Chief Justice Roberts’ incisive statement: “The\nway to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” Parents Involved\nin Cmty. Sch. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 748 (2007) (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (emphasis added).\n\n                                                         56\n\f         While the tide may be turning against this approach to affirmative action, it has yet to\n\ndirectly reach Johnson’s Title VII standard. 17 Much of the doubt about our present affirmative\n\naction jurisprudence has been consigned to dissents, non-controlling concurrences, dictum, and\n\nscholarly critiques. 18 Absent a clear statement from the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals\n\nthat Johnson no longer governs, this Court must apply its principles. Therefore, Shea’s Title VII\n\nchallenge to State’s affirmative action plan must fail, and State is entitled to summary judgment.\n\nThis constitutes final judgment in this action, and the Court dismiss this case with prejudice.\n\n         A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date.\n\n         Signed by Royce C. Lamberth, Chief Judge, on May 10, 2013.\n\n\n\n17\n  Many—including Judge Robertson in this case, Mem. Order 8 n.3, Aug. 11, 2009, ECF No. 69—have questioned\nthe continuing viability of Johnson and other affirmative action precedent in light of Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U.S.\n557 (2009). See, e.g., Marcia L. McCormick, Disparate Impact and Equal Protection After Ricci v. DeStefano, 27\nWIS. J.L. GENDER & SOC’Y 100 (2012); Roberto L. Corrada, Ricci’s Dicta: Signaling a New Standard for\nAffirmative Action Under Title VII?, 46 WAKE FOREST L. REV. 241 (2011); Sachin S. Pandya, Detecting the Stealth\nErosion of Precedent: Affirmative Action After Ricci, 31 BERKELEY J. EMP. & LAB. L. 285 (2010). However, as\nthese articles indicate, nothing in Ricci directly overturns or modifies Johnson, at least as it applies to this case. The\narguments are that Ricci has dicta signaling that the Supreme Court will change course on affirmative action in the\nfuture. This Court cannot depart from long-standing, clear precedent based on such speculation.\nMany also thought—including this Judge in Stewart, 948 F. Supp. at 1094–95—there would be a significant change\nto affirmative action jurisprudence after City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469 (1989) and Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200 (1995). See, e.g., Margaret A. Sewell, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena:\nThe Armageddon of Affirmative Action, 46 DEPAUL L. REV. 611 (1997); Lara Hudgins, Rethinking Affirmative\nAction in the 1990s: Tailoring the Cure to Remedy the Disease, 47 BAYLOR L. REV. 815 (1995); John Payton, The\nMeaning and Significance of the Croson Case, 1 GEO. MASON U. CIV. RTS. L.J. 59 (1990). This has yet to pass, as\nin the years since Croson and Adarand, the Supreme Court has yet to overrule Johnson and Weber. Cf. Neal\nDevins, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena and the Continuing Irrelevance of Supreme Court Affirmative Action\nDecisions, 37 WM. & MARY L. REV. 673 (1996) (arguing neither Croson or Adarand had effect many expected).\nOthers still thought that Parents Involved, 551 U.S. 701 (2007), sounded the death kneel for affirmative action. See\nKatherine M. Planer, The Death of Diversity? Affirmative Action in the Workplace After Parents Involved, 39 SETON\nHALL L. REV. 1333 (2009). While not much may be clear about affirmative action, the reports of its demise have\nbeen greatly exaggerated. Cf.

Compl., Mar. 3,\n\n2002, ECF No. 1. When State hired Shea in 1992, State operated an affirmative action program\n\nthat made qualified minorities eligible for direct placement into mid-level classes of the Foreign\n\nService. Shea claims he would have been eligible for this mid-level placement program but for\n\nhis race and still feels the effect of his entry at a lower pay grade—each paycheck is less than it\n\nwould have been if he entered as a mid-level officer.\n\n         This case suffered a series of fits and starts, largely attributable to Ledbetter v. Goodyear\n\nTire & Rubber Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145727\"><a href=\"/opinion/145727/ledbetter-v-goodyear-tire-rubber-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007) and the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, Pub. L. No. 111–2\n\n(Jan. 29, 2009). Since Shea based his claim on the continuing effects of a discriminatory\n\ndecision made in 1992, his claim was time-barred until passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Act. The\n\nsubstantive merits are finally ripe for consideration as the Court considers each party’s motion\n\n1\n On February 1, 2013, John F. Kerry succeeded Hillary Clinton as the United States Secretary of State. Since this\nsuit is against the Secretary of State in his or her official capacity only, the Court will substitute Secretary Kerry as\ndefendant in this matter, per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d).\n\ffor summary judgment. Under Title VII, Shea has the ultimate burden of proving that State’s\n\naffirmative action plan was unlawful. Shea cannot support an essential element of his claim with\n\nadmissible evidence. He tries to prove, via his own amateur statistics, that minorities were not\n\nsignificantly underrepresented in the Foreign Service mid-levels.         Shea needs, and lacks,\n\nqualified testimony about the statistical significance of his findings. Therefore, State is entitled\n\nto summary judgment on Shea’s remaining claims and this case will be dismissed with prejudice.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Factual Background\n\n       In 1985, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986\n\nand 1987 (“1986–87 FRAA”).           Pub. L. 99–93.      The 1986–87 FRAA directed State to\n\n“develop…a plan designed to increase significantly the number of members of minority groups\n\nand women in the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 99-93, Title I, § 152(a). Congress further directed\n\nthat “each plan developed pursuant this section shall…place particular emphasis in achieving\n\nsignificant increases in the numbers of minority group members and women who are in the mid-\n\nlevels of the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 99-93, Title I, § 152(b). Thereafter, State instituted the\n\nMid-Level Affirmative Action Plan (“MLAAP”) under its more general Mid-Level Foreign\n\nService Career Candidate Program (“MLCCP”). See Def.’s Statement of Facts Not in Genuine\n\nDispute ¶ 3 (“Def.’s SMF”), Aug. 17, 2012, ECF No. 120-1; Pl.’s Response to Def.’s Statement\n\nof Material Facts Not in Dispute 7–8 (“Pl.’s SMF Resp.”), Aug. 30, 2012, ECF No. 123-4 (only\n\nobjecting to defendant’s statement that MLAAP was “in response” to FRAA). Although white\n\nwomen were not qualified to participate in the MLAAP, State created the “Federal Women\n\nPrograms” and the Federal Women’s Program manager to develop and monitor programs aimed\n\nat greater female representation. Def.’s SMF ¶ 4; Pl.’s SMF Resp. (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 4).\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\f       In 1987, Congress enacted the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988\n\nand 1989 (“1988–89 FRAA”). Pub. L. 100–204. In the 1988–89 FRAA Congress found:\n\n       [T]hat the Department of State and other Foreign Service agencies have not been\n       successful in their efforts – (1) to recruit and retain members of minority groups\n       in order to increase significantly the numbers of minority groups in the Foreign\n       Service; and (2) to provide adequate career advancement for women and members\n       of minority groups in the senior levels of the Foreign Service.\n\nPub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(a). Congress further required State to “substantially increase\n\ntheir efforts to implement effectively the plans required by” the 1986–87 FRAA and “ensure that\n\nthose plans effectively address the need to promote increased numbers of qualified women and\n\nmembers of minority groups into the senior levels of the Foreign Service.” Pub. L. 100–204,\n\nTitle I, § 183(b). State revised the MLAAP in November 1990 and instituted its FY 1990–92\n\nMid-Level Affirmative Action Plan, which was in effect when Shea applied to, and was hired by,\n\nState. Def.’s SMF ¶ 9; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 9).\n\n       Mid-level hiring allowed State to hire a Foreign Service candidate directly into a higher\n\ngrade, rather than into an entry-level grade. Under the general mid-level hiring program, a\n\ncandidate with the requisite experience could enter as a mid-level hire if State received a\n\n“certification of need” that State required an outside hire at that grade and with those\n\nqualifications. The Mid-Level Affirmative Action Plan dispensed with the “certification of\n\nneed” requirement in favor of self-identification as American Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian and\n\nPacific Islander, Hispanic, or African American. State required all candidates for mid-level\n\nhiring—both minority and non-minority—to (a) have substantial professional experience, (b)\n\nreceive a passing grade on an oral examination, and (c) pass a background check. In February\n\n1993, State ended the mid-level affirmative action program, but kept in place its more general\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fmid-level hiring program. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–11 (admitting in all\n\nrelevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17).\n\n        In September 1990, William Shea—a white male of Irish descent—submitted an\n\napplication to the Foreign Service. Shea never applied for mid-level placement through the\n\ngeneral Mid-Level Foreign Service Career Candidate Program. In May 1993, State hired Shea as\n\nan entry-level career Foreign Service Officer; he came in at grade FS-05, step 5. 2 Shea knew at\n\nthe time he was hired that qualified minorities could start at higher grades, and that two people in\n\nhis introductory class were starting at mid-level grades due to their participation in a minority\n\nmid-level hiring program. Shea did not file an administrative grievance until July 11, 2001—\n\nnine years after he entered the Foreign Service. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 20–23, 26, 37; Pl.’s SMF Resp.\n\n13–16 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 20–23, 26, 37).\n\n        In his Complaint, Shea alleged that he would have passed the screening process of the\n\nMLAAP, but was excluded from consideration solely because of his race. Specifically, Shea\n\nalleged harm because his hiring at entry-level rather than mid-level grade has subjected him to\n\nlower pay and fewer promotion opportunities than members of minority groups admitted under\n\nthe MLAAP, in violation of his rights under Title VII. See Compl. ¶¶ 1–2.\n\n        B.       Procedural Background\n\n        On July 11, 2001, Shea filed a grievance with the State Department asserting, among\n\nother things, racial discrimination in violation of Title VII because of the disparate pay he was\n\nreceiving. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 37; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 11 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 37); Compl. ¶¶ 1–\n\n2. On January 30, 2002, Shea received the decision of the Foreign Service Grievance Board\n\ndismissing Shea’s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.                 Compl. ¶ 2.

His Complaint raised a\n\nTitle VII challenge to the MLAAP, claiming he was injured by continuing to receive a lower\n\npaycheck than he would had he been eligible for mid-level placement though the MLAAP.\n\n       The case was initially assigned to Judge James Robertson, who granted State’s Motion to\n\nDismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because Shea’s complaint and\n\nadministrative grievance were untimely.

He\n\nfound Shea’s “complaint amounted to no more than allegations of discrimination in May 1992,\n\nwhen he started at a lower pay grade.” Mem. 4, ECF No. 16. Judge Robertson held that each\n\nallegedly-diminished paycheck did not amount to a new, discrete discriminatory act that reset the\n\nclock for filing an administrative complaint. Id. at 3–4.

Bazemore could not save Shea\n\nbecause State did not engage in any “fresh discrimination” or continue a discriminatory system\n\nduring the limitations period; it was undisputed that State ended its mid-level affirmative action\n\nprogram in 1993.

At that time, the factual record regarding the legality of State’s affirmative action\n\nplan had not been well developed. Id. at 8. Therefore, Judge Robertson denied both parties’\n\nmotions for summary judgment, id. at 11, and set a schedule for additional fact and expert\n\ndiscovery, see Scheduling Order, Sept. 23, 2009, ECF No. 73.\n\n       Several miscellaneous motions followed. First, State objected to the Court’s treatment of\n\nthe MLAAP as a voluntary affirmative action plan and requested reconsideration. See Def.’s\n\nFirst Mot.

On January 1, 2010, Shea filed his still-pending Motion\n\nfor Summary Judgment, ECF No. 74. Thereafter, the Court allowed State to amend its discovery\n\nresponses so State will not have been deemed to admit to several of Shea’s factual claims. See\n\nOrder Granting Def.’s Mot. for Leave to File, Feb. 2, 2010, ECF No. 78.\n\n                                               7\n\f       Judge Robertson retired in 2010, and the case was randomly reassigned to Judge Henry\n\nH.

Minute Order, July 6, 2010; Revised Scheduling Order, July 6, 2010, ECF No. 84.\n\n       Shea then filed a motion for reconsideration, challenging various aspects of Judge\n\nRobertson’s prior rulings. Pl.’s Mot. Reconsideration, July 23, 2010, ECF No. 85. Shea also\n\nmoved to hold discovery deadlines in abeyance until resolution of this motion. ECF No. 86. In\n\nresponse, Judge Sullivan stayed the entire matter until an April 6, 2011 status conference.\n\nMinute Order, Mar. 9, 2011. At that conference, he orally extended the stay indefinitely.\n\n       The parties continued to file motions during the stay.

Def.’s Second Mot.\n\nReconsideration, Apr. 5, 2011, ECF No. 93.

See Reassignment of Civil Case, ECF No. 105.\n\nChief Judge Lamberth denied both parties’ motions for reconsideration and Shea’s motion for\n\napplication of judicial estoppel, and lifted the stay on July 30, 2012.

Summary Judgment\n\n       “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine\n\ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\nR.

The mere\n\nexistence of any factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment; “the requirement is that there\n\nbe no genuine issue of material fact.” Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247–48 (emphasis in original). A\n\nfact is material if, under the applicable law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A\n\ndispute is genuine if the “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\n\nnonmoving party.” Id. Because “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and\n\nthe drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge,” the\n\n“evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in\n\nhis favor.” Id. at 255. A nonmoving party, however, must establish more than “the existence of\n\na scintilla of evidence” in support of its position. Id. at 252. The inferences drawn from the\n\nevidence “must be reasonably probable and based on more than mere speculation.” Rogers\n\nCorp. v.

The moving party is\n       “entitled to a judgment as a matter of law” because the nonmoving party has\n       failed to make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with\n       respect to which she has the burden of proof.\n\n477 U.S. at 322–23 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). The Supreme Court meant “to disapprove a\n\nline of cases allowing a party opposing summary judgment to resist a properly made motion by\n\nreference only to its pleadings,” id. at 325:\n\n       In cases…where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial on a\n       dispositive issue, a summary judgment motion may properly be made in reliance\n       solely on the “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\n       on file.” Such a motion, whether or not accompanied by affidavits, will be “made\n       and supported as provided in this rule,” and Rule 56(e) therefore requires the\n       nonmoving party to go beyond the pleadings and by her own affidavits, or by the\n       “depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,” designate\n       “specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”\n\nId. at 324 (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56).\n\n       Rule 56 allows a party seeking or opposing summary judgment to “object that the\n\nmaterial cited to support or dispute a fact cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible\n\nin evidence.” Fed .R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2). While at summary judgment the nonmovant “is not\n\nrequired to produce evidence in a form that would be admissible at trial,” the evidence must be\n\n\n\n                                                 10\n\f“capable of being converted into admissible evidence.” Catrett v.

As the Supreme Court stated:\n\n      Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that race or sex has been taken into\n      account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts to the employer\n      to articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an\n      affirmative action plan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as\n      the basis for the employer’s decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that\n      the employer’s justification is pretextual and the plan is invalid.\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 627. The plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of establishing the invalidity of\n\nthe affirmative action plan. Id. Reliance on an affirmative action plan is not an “affirmative\n\ndefense requiring the employer to carry the burden of proving the validity of the plan. The\n\nburden of proving its invalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id.\n\n       In analyzing affirmative action plans under Title VII, courts consider: (1) whether the\n\nplan was justified by a “manifest imbalance” reflecting an underrepresentation of minorities or\n\n                                                 12\n\fwomen in “traditionally segregated job categories”; and (2) whether the plan was properly\n\ntailored to cure the disparity without unnecessarily trammeling the interests of non-minorities.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. Statistically significant disparities between the percentage of minorities\n\nemployed and the percentage of qualified minorities in the labor market can be strong evidence\n\nof a manifest imbalance. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 433; Palmer v. Shultz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485647\"><a href=\"/opinion/485647/alison-palmer-v-george-p-shultz-as-secretary-of-state-marguerite-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1987). Writing for the Court in Johnson, Justice Brennan stated that a “manifest imbalance\n\nneed not be such that it would support a prima facie case against the employer.” 480 U.S. at\n\n632; see also id. at 633 n.11 (“However, as long as there is a manifest imbalance, an employer\n\nmay adopt a plan even where the disparity is not so striking, without being required to introduce\n\nthe nonstatistical evidence of past discrimination that would be demanded by the ‘prima facie’\n\nstandard.”); Stewart, 948 F. Supp. at 1094 (“Nor is a finding or admission of prior discrimination\n\nrequired in a Title VII case.     Indeed, to adopt affirmative measures to resolve Title VII\n\nemployment discrimination claims, the employer need not admit to any prior discrimination, nor\n\npoint ‘to evidence of an ‘arguable violation’ on its part.’” (quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 630)).\n\n       Shortly after Johnson, Judge Kenneth Starr of the D.C. Circuit read Johnson as not\n\neviscerating the existing “predicate of discrimination” requirement—an employer may only use\n\naffirmative action as a remedy for prior discrimination. Hammon, 826 F.2d at 74–75. Statistics\n\nshowing an “egregious underrepresent[ation]” of minorities may give rise to an “inference of\n\ndiscrimination” by the employer. Id. at 75. Finding that the Johnson majority agreed with\n\nJustice O’Connor’s statement that affirmative action is permissible under Weber “only as a\n\nremedial device to eliminate actual or apparent discrimination or the lingering effects of this\n\ndiscrimination,” Johnson, 440 U.S. at 649 (O’Connor, J., concurring), Judge Starr held that\n\n“although an employer need not admit or prove that it had acted discriminatorily, evidence of the\n\n\n\n                                                13\n\feffects of its past or current discrimination is a prerequisite to lawful race-conscious employment\n\ndecisions,” 826 F.2d at 75 n.1.\n\n        In determining whether the affirmative action plan unnecessarily trammels the interests\n\nof non-minorities, courts focus on the nature of the plan—including whether the plan is\n\ntemporary, whether it was intended to attain or maintain a racial balance, whether it imposes\n\nquotas, whether it requires the discharge of white employees, and whether it is over-inclusive.\n\nSee, e.g., Weber, 443 U.S. at 208; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636–40; United States v.

Order, Sept. 30, 2003, ECF No. 15; Order, Nov. 21, 2008, ECF No. 64.

Over Justice\n\nScalia’s vigorous dissent, 480 U.S. at 657–77, Justice Brennan’s majority opinion in Johnson\n\nmade clear that the statutory test differs from the constitutional test, 480 U.S. at 627 n.6.\n\n         Johnson and its progeny describe the Title VII standard under which courts analyze\n\nvoluntary affirmative action programs.              State repeatedly argued that the MLAAP is not a\n\n“voluntary” plan—that the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, 22 U.S.C. § 3922a, mandated\n\nthe creation of an affirmative action plan.                   See, e.g., Def.’s Mem. ISO its First Mot.\n\nReconsideration 4–6; Def.’s Mem. ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration.                              This Court has\n\nrejected these arguments, finding that while the FRAA “clearly requires State to implement a\n\nplan to address mid-level positions, it is silent on to the means by which State is to accomplish\n\nthis goal.” Shea v. Clinton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (D.D.C. 2012). The Court concluded,\n\nwhile also rejecting State’s argument for legislative immunity, that “[t]he FRAA clearly does not\n\nmandate an exception to Title VII and does not mandate creation of the MLAAP specifically.”\n\n\n\n2011). “To establish an equal protection claim, plaintiff must show that she was singled out from among others\nsimilarly situated on the basis of race and/or national origin.” Id. The plaintiff cannot rely on the “ongoing negative\nconsequences” of the prior discrimination to extend the statute of limitations for his equal protection claim. Id.\nThe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, 123 Stat. 5 (2009), does not address constitutional or 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claims.\nThe Ledbetter Act did explicitly mention that it applies to claims under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the\nAge Discrimination Act of 1967, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\nId. It would be very odd for the Ledbetter Act to specify, with great detail, the types of claims to which it applies\nand then, sub silentio, change the statute of limitations for claims under the equal protection clause or § 1983. See,\ne.g., ANTONIN SCALIA & BRIAN A. GARNER, READING LAW: THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS 93–100 (2012)\n(explaining semantic canon that “[n]othing is to be added to what the text states or reasonably implies (casus\nomissus pro omisso habendus est). That is, a matter not covered is to be treated as not covered.”); id. at 107–111\n(explaining the “negative-implication canon” which suggests that “[t]he expression of one thing implies the\nexclusion of others (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).”).\nFurthermore, courts typically look to state law to determine the statute of limitations for constitutional claims.\nSee Carney v.

As this Court has found previously, see id. at 158–62, it reiterates that MLAAP is a\n\nvoluntary affirmative action plan subject to Johnson and its progeny.\n\n       This case is not a “mixed motive” or “direct evidence” case.

J. 39 (“Pl’s Opp’n & Reply”), Aug. 30, 2012, ECF No. 123.\n\nIn Price Waterhouse, the Supreme Court set the standard for “mixed motive” Title VII cases:\n\nOnce a plaintiff shows an employer acted with an impermissible motive, the burden of proof\n\nshifts to the employer to prove that it would have made the same decision even in the absence of\n\nthe impermissible motive. 490 U.S. at 242. In 1991, Congress amended Title VII; section 107\n\nof the 1991 Act codified Price Waterhouse “to the extent that it shifts the burden of persuasion to\n\nthe defendant to prove a nondiscriminatory motive was at work.” 2 BARBARA T. LINDEMANN,\n\nPAUL GROSSMAN & C. GEOFFREY WEIRICH, EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW 2544 (4th ed.\n\n2007). However, this is not a “mixed motive” case, and courts typically do not treat “reverse\n\ndiscrimination” cases as falling under the burden-shifting framework of Price Waterhouse and §\n\n107. See id. at 2544–46. Courts in this Circuit have long held that the mere existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan does not provide “direct evidence” of discrimination.

Cir. 2004).\n\n       Shea may only challenge State’s revised FY 1990–92 Multi-Year Affirmative Action\n\nPlan. When the Court refers to the “MLAAP” generally, it refers to the 1990–92 plan in effect at\n\nthe time of Shea’s hiring. At times, Shea presents arguments based on deficiencies in State’s\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\fearlier 1987 Multi-Year Affirmative Action Plan. See generally Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply. This plan\n\nwas not in effect when Shea applied to State. Shea cannot directly challenge the 1987 MLAAP,\n\nand the details of its alleged shortcomings are of limited probative value. On the other hand, the\n\nfindings of underrepresentation and prior discrimination underpinning the 1987 MLAAP may be\n\nrelevant to justifying the later plan. The 1990–92 plan was a continuation and refinement of an\n\nexisting plan. State did not need to justify the revised plan out of whole cloth; it may rely in part\n\non its earlier findings of discrimination and underrepresentation if it found that significant\n\nunderrepresentation persisted, and race conscious policies continued to be necessary.\n\n       When considering the numbers, the Court focuses on the mid- and senior-levels of career\n\nForeign Service generalist officers. At the time, the Department of State had two personnel\n\nsystems—one covering the “Foreign Service,” and one covering the “Civil Service system.” See\n\nEx. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 26 (Shea – 00090). The “Civil Service system” covered the gamut of\n\nemployees responsible for the general administration of the State Department, including clerical,\n\ntechnical, and legal staff. Within the Foreign Service, there are Foreign Service Officers (or\n\n“Generalists”) and Foreign Service Specialists.         Foreign Service Officers have “general\n\nresponsibility for carrying out and conducting the United States’ foreign relations throughout the\n\nworld.”    Id.   Within this corps, State assigned its officers to one of four “cones”—\n\nAdministrative, Consular, Economic, and Political. Foreign Service Specialists, on the other\n\nhand, are “professional specialists in communications, security, medicine, office support skills,\n\nand other fields.” Id. State is responsible for meeting EEO goals for both the Civil and Foreign\n\nService, and for both Foreign Service Generalists and Specialists. Many of the reports submitted\n\nby State also discuss underrepresentation in the Civil Service and Foreign Service Specialist\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\franks. See, e.g., Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (State FY 1990–92 Multi-Year Affirmative Action\n\nPlan); Ex. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (GAO report on underrepresentation in Foreign Service).\n\n       Shea applied for, and received, a position as an entry-level Foreign Service Officer. See\n\nEx. 12 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Agreement to Join the Foreign Service, April 22, 1992); Ex. 13 to\n\nDef.’s Cross-Mot. (employment form SF 50-B). Therefore, the rates of underrepresentation of\n\ncareer Foreign Service generalist officers are relevant to this case. Underrepresentation in the\n\nmid- and senior-levels is relevant because Congress specifically expressed dissatisfaction of the\n\nminority representation at both levels, and directed State to take action to correct for these\n\nspecific imbalances. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b); 1988–89 FRAA,\n\nPub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b)).\n\n       With the correct standard and object of inquiry settled, the Court reiterates that in order\n\nfor Shea to prevail, he must prove “(1) that the MLAAP was unlawful, (2) that except for his\n\nrace, Shea was qualified for the program, and (3) that Shea was damaged during the period in\n\nquestion by the continuing effects of the MLAAP.” Shea, 850 F. Supp. 2d at 163. At trial, Shea\n\nwould have the burden of proving the unlawfulness of the MLAPP. See Johnson, 489 U.S. at\n\n627. He cannot do meet this burden with admissible evidence, and thus has “fail[ed] to make a\n\nshowing sufficient to establish an element essential” to his case.

This requirement is “not designed to\n\ndisadvantage the white plaintiff,” but “merely substitutes for the minority plaintiff’s burden to\n\nshow that he is a member of a racial minority; both are criteria for determining when the\n\nemployer’s conduct raises an ‘inference of discrimination.’” Id. at 153.\n\n       A white male plaintiff may show background circumstances in one of two ways. First, he\n\n“may produce evidence that his employer has reason or inclination to discriminate against the\n\nmajority.” Checka, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (citing Mastro v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186669\"><a href=\"/opinion/186669/mastro-brian-a-v-potomac-elec-power/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 851 (D.C.

He may do so by presenting evidence of “political pressure to\n\npromote a particular minority because of his race, pressure to promote minorities in general, and\n\nproposed affirmative action plans.” Mastro, 446 F.3d at 851. Second, the plaintiff may offer\n\nevidence that there is “‘something ‘fishy’ about the facts of the case at hand that raises an\n\ninference of discrimination.’” Id. (quoting Harding, 9 F.3d at 153). “Evidence that a white\n\nplaintiff was given little or no consideration for a position that was given to a minority candidate\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\for that a minority candidate was promoted over four objectively qualified white candidates has\n\nbeen sufficient to show ‘something ‘fishy[.]’” Checka, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 87.\n\n       At least one district court in this jurisdiction has held that the mere “existence of an\n\naffirmative action policy,” does not “automatically impl[y] discrimination against the majority”\n\nfor the purposes of establishing a prima facie case.

In denying both parties’ motions\n\nfor summary judgment, the Court found that “State has admitted [Shea’s] qualifications by\n\nfailing to respond to proper requests for admissions.” Mem. Order 9, Aug. 11, 2009, ECF No. 69\n\n(emphasis in original). Thereafter, State requested leave to amend its discovery responses.\n\nDef.’s Mot. Am./Correct, Jan. 7, 2010, ECF No. 75. Over Shea’s objection, this Court held:\n\n       [I]t appears (a) that defendant’s asserted “admission” that plaintiff would have\n       been qualified for MLAAP occurs only by operation of the government’s failure\n       to respond to a request for admissions; and (b) that the failure to respond was\n       justifiable, given the stops and starts that have occurred in this litigation. It also\n       appears, however, (c) that injecting the rhetorical question of the plaintiff’s\n       qualifications for MLAAP at this late stage of this long-running case would not\n       “promote the presentation of the merits of the action,” and (d) that it would\n       prejudice the plaintiff in maintaining or defending the action on the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                                20\n\f       It is accordingly ORDERED that defendant’s motion is granted, but that, unless\n       the government is prepared to demonstrate that any non-minority person applied\n       for and was denied acceptance to MLAAP because of his or her qualifications, the\n       plaintiff will be deemed to have been qualified for MLAAP – except for his race\n       (or national origin, or ethnicity).\n\nOrder 1–2, Feb. 2, 2010, ECF No. 78 (emphasis in original). In response, State identified two\n\nminority applicants who had applied for and were denied acceptance to MLAAP because of their\n\nqualifications. See Decl. of Alina Eldred ¶¶ 4–11, Sept. 17, 2012, ECF No. 128-2. This misread\n\nthe Court’s Order. The Court required State to offer proof that non-minority applicants were\n\ndenied acceptance to MLAAP because of their qualifications; it said nothing about the status of\n\nminority applicants. Since State’s submission was not responsive to this Court’s Order, the\n\nCourt deems Shea to have been qualified for MLAAP, except for his race.\n\n       State’s admission that Shea would have been qualified but for his race establishes the\n\nnecessary causal connection between the MLAAP and discrimination against the majority. The\n\nburden of establishing “background circumstances” is “minimal,” and not intended to be “an\n\nadditional hurdle for white plaintiffs.” Harding, 9 F.3d at 153–54. Therefore, this Court finds\n\nthat Shea has demonstrated “background circumstances that support the suspicion that the\n\ndefendant is the unusual employer that discriminates against the majority,” id. at 153, and thus\n\nhas sufficiently stated his prima facie case.\n\n       B.      State’s Reliance on its Affirmative Action Program\n\n       Shea has established a prima facie case of employment discrimination under Title VII.\n\nTherefore, State has the burden of producing “admissible evidence that, if believed, would\n\nestablish that the employer’s action was motivated by a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.”\n\nTeneyck, 365 F.3d at 1151. Under Johnson, the “existence of an affirmative action plan provides\n\nsuch a rationale.” 480 U.S. at 627. “As a practical matter…an employer will generally seek to\n\n\n\n                                                21\n\favoid a charge of pretext by presenting evidence in support of its plan.          That does not\n\nmean…that reliance on an affirmative action plan is…an affirmative defense requiring the\n\nemployer to carry the burden of proving the validity of the plan. The burden of proving its\n\ninvalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 626–27.\n\n       The “employer’s burden is one of production, not persuasion.” Teneyck, 365 F.3d at\n\n1151. “By producing evidence (whether ultimately persuasive or not) of nondiscriminatory\n\nreasons,” the employer will have “sustained [its] burden of production.” St. Mary’s Honor Ctr.\n\nv. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (1993) (emphasis in original). Courts should not make credibility\n\nassessments regarding the employer’s evidence; an employer meets its burden if it “introduce[s]\n\nevidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there was a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the adverse action.” Id. (emphasis in original). “The employer ‘need not persuade the\n\ncourt that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant’s\n\nevidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.’”\n\nAntrum v. Washington Metro.

To the extent this Court\n\ndiscusses evidence that goes beyond merely satisfying State’s burden of production, this does not\n\nsuggest that State has—at any time—the burden of persuasion. State’s evidence concerning the\n\nlawfulness of its plan, however, can make it harder for Shea to prove that State’s asserted non-\n\ndiscriminatory reasons are merely pretext and that State employed an unlawful affirmative action\n\nplan. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626–27.\n\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\f                  1.       Manifest Imbalance and Discrimination in the Workforce\n\n         There must be a manifest imbalance in the workforce, reflecting discrimination in\n\ntraditionally segregated job categories, justifying State’s adoption of an affirmative action plan.\n\nWeber, 443 U.S. at 208. As explained by Weber and Johnson, statistically significant disparities\n\nbetween minorities in the workplace and qualified minorities in the labor market may establish a\n\nmanifest imbalance. For “skilled” positions the relevant comparator group is the number of\n\nminorities with the requisite qualifications. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632–33 (“[I]n determining\n\nwhether an imbalance exists that would justify taking sex or race into account, a comparison of\n\nthe percentage of minorities or women in the employer’s work force with the percentage in the\n\narea labor market or general population is appropriate in analyzing jobs that require no special\n\nexpertise…. Where a job requires special training, however, the comparison should be with\n\nthose in the labor force who possess the relevant qualifications.”). 4\n\n         Since affirmative action plans are justified by their “remedial” purpose, State must offer\n\nsome evidence of a “predicate of discrimination.” See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 80–81. Stark\n\nstatistical disparities might, by themselves, infer past discrimination by the employer. See\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 636 (manifest imbalance shown when none of the 238 skilled positions\n\nwere occupied by a women).               If the statistical comparisons merely reflect general societal\n\ndiscrimination—for which the employer was not responsible—the numbers alone might not\n\njustify remedial action. See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 80–81. State is not required to “admit” to past\n\n\n4\n  While Congress directed State to increase its minority recruitment efforts “so that the Foreign Service becomes\ntruly representation of the American people,” 1988–89 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204, Title I, § 183(b), there is no\nindication that State ever used the “American people” as its comparator when calculating minority\nunderrepresentation. Cf. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 654 (although stated long-term goal of affirmative action plan was to\nreach employment levels that “approximat[ed] the distribution of women…in the Santa Clara County workforce,”\nthis “long-range goal was never used as a guide for actual hiring decisions” and “was merely a statement of\naspiration wholly without operational significance”). State based its short-term goals on the number of qualified\nminorities in the workforce, not the number in the total labor market or general population.

Some combination of\n\nstatistical imbalance and evidence of the employer’s past or current discrimination can provide\n\nthe necessary factual predicate to justify a remedial affirmative action plan.

Statistical imbalance and minority underrepresentation\n\n       The defendant offers sufficient evidence to show that a finding of significant minority\n\nunderrepresentation motivated the State Department’s adoption of its affirmative action plan. As\n\ndiscussed in Part I.A. supra, the chronic underrepresentation of minorities in the State\n\nDepartment—and the mid- and senior-levels of the Foreign Service in particular—had long been\n\nan issue. Congress demanded greater minority representation at State, and closely monitored\n\nState’s efforts to set and meet diversity goals. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 99–93; 1988–89\n\nFRAA, Pub. L. 100–204. Congress held hearings where representatives discussed minority\n\nunderrepresentation in the Foreign Service, explored the nature and extent of the problem, and\n\nasked State what it was doing to fix the problem. See Underrepresentation of Women and\n\nMinorities in the Foreign Service—State Department: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on the Civil\n\nService of the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989) (Ex. 4 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot.); The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint Hearing Before the Subcomm.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fon Int’l Operations of the H. Comm. on Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Service of\n\nthe H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989) (Ex. 5 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.).\n\n        In the late 1980s—directly preceding the drafting and adoption of the 1990–92\n\nMLAAP—two reports studied the Foreign Service personnel and management systems. Thomas\n\nCommission Report; Bremer Study Group Report. 5 Congress mandated the “Thomas Report” in\n\nthe 1988–89 FRAA; the Secretary of State himself commissioned the “Bremer Report.” See The\n\nDepartment of State in the 21st Century (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry Sikorski, Chairman,\n\nSubcomm. on Civil Service). As interpreted by Rep. Gerry Sikorski, the Chairman of the Civil\n\nService Subcommittee, these reports “tell [Congress] that management of the U.S. Foreign\n\nService is seriously flawed.”        Id.   The reports “show that officer training has particularly\n\nsuffered,” and address in particular the “issues of recruitment, career development and training,\n\nthe underrepresentation of women and minorities, [and] the lack of management skills[.]” Id.\n\n        In June 1989, the General Accounting Office (“GAO”) issued a report titled, “State\n\nDepartment: Minorities and Women Are Underrepresented in the Foreign Service.” See Ex. 3 to\n\nDef.’s Cross-Mot. This report found that while existing affirmative action programs had made\n\nsome progress, minorities remained underrepresented:\n\n        The State Department increased minority representation in the Foreign Service\n        from 7 percent in 1981 to 11 percent in 1987…. In 1987 minorities and white\n        women were still substantially underrepresented when compared to civilian labor\n        force data that the EEOC has issued to measure federal agencies.\n\n        Progress has been mixed in the FS officer and specialist categories. At the entry\n        level, underrepresentation in the FS officer corps has been eliminated, except for\n        Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders. In the mid-level ranks of the officer corps,\n        minority male representation has increased, but minority and white women have\n        made less progress.          In State’s Senior Foreign Service positions,\n        underrepresentation of minorities and white women is still pervasive.\n\n5\n   Both reports were entered into the record during The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint Hearing\nBefore the Subcomm. on Int’l Operations of the H. Comm. on Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Service\nof the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil Service, 101st Cong. (1989)) (Ex. 5 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.).\n\n                                                     25\n\fId. at 15 (Shea – 008689). An accompanying chart shows that, as of September 1987, females of\n\nevery race were underrepresented as senior and mid-level Foreign Service Officers, minorities of\n\nevery race were underrepresented as senior Foreign Service Officers, and Hispanics and\n\nAsian/Pacific Islanders were underrepresented in the mid-levels.                        Id. at 20 (Table 2.3:\n\nUnderrepresentation of Minorities and White Women in State’s Foreign Service by Grade (As of\n\nSept. 1987)) (Shea – 008694).\n\n         Shea seizes on this chart—and State’s unfortunate misinterpretation of it 6—as evidence\n\nthat not all MLAAP-eligible minority groups were underrepresented. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply\n\n4–6. After all, the chart showed that as of 1987 black and Indian/Alaskan males were fully\n\nrepresented in the Foreign Service Officer mid-levels. However, this chart neither undermines\n\nState’s evidentiary proffer that the MLAAP was lawful, nor proves that the MLAAP was\n\nunlawful. First, the GAO report acknowledged the limitations of its numbers—the agency had to\n\ncompare 1987 State Department employment data with a 1980 comparator population:\n\n         The criteria established by the EEOC is based on 1980 census data, but\n         considerable change has occurred in the civilian labor force since 1980. If these\n         changes were considered in analyzing State’s representation, the extent to which\n         minorities and women are underrepresented would be worse than depicted in table\n         2.3. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows that blacks, Hispanics, and white\n         women have increased their representation in the civilian labor force in recent\n         years.\n\n6\n  In a rather serious mistake, State used this chart in its Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment to show that “in 1987\nthere were no African-American, Hispanic, or Indian males in mid-level positions.” Pl.’s Cross-Mot. Summ. J.\n12 (emphasis in original). Worse still, State bolded this language, drawing special attention to its mistake. Digging\nthe hole deeper, State was repeating a mistake they had made previously—and had filed an errata to correct. See\nDef.’s Reply ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration 6, May 18, 2011, ECF No. 98 (stating the same incorrect\nstatement verbatim, minus the bolding); Errata to Def.’s Reply ISO its Second Mot. Reconsideration 1, May 25,\n2011, ECF No. 100 (admitting that the chart “actually shows a comparison” of workforce and census data “to\ndemonstrate that, under current EEOC criteria, the underrepresentation of minority males in some levels of the\nForeign Service was ‘0’”).\nPerhaps State did not take its pro se opponent seriously. The Court warns State that such sloppy lawyering could\nhave cost State dearly if State had the burden of persuasion, rather than simply the burden of production. If this\nwere a constitutional challenge—and strict scrutiny applied—State may have failed to justify the MLAAP based on\nthe record submitted.\n\n                                                        26\n\fEx. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 21 (Shea – 008695). Hammon made clear that a court must use the\n\nmost recent available data when determining whether there is a manifest imbalance. 826 F.3d at\n\n77–78. When State adopted the 1990–92 MLAAP, it had more recent work force data available.\n\nSee Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 47–47a (Shea – 00116–17) (discussed in more detail infra).\n\nSecond, Shea’s criticism takes a narrow view of the MLAAP. The MLAAP may work to\n\nincrease minority representation not only in the mid-levels, but also in the senior-levels. Table\n\n2.3 shows across-the-board minority underrepresentation in the senior-levels. Ex. 3 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 20 (Shea – 008694). Mid-level minority placement may not be necessary for all\n\ngroups, if the only concern was underrepresentation in the mid-levels. However, mid-level\n\nplacement helps alleviate the significant underrepresentation of minorities in the senior levels by\n\nmaking more minorities eligible for promotion into the Senior Foreign Service. Viewed this\n\nway, Table 2.3 does not undermine State’s evidentiary proffer. 7\n\n         When State formally adopted the revised 1990–92 MLAAP, it made additional findings\n\nabout manifest imbalance based on more recent work force and labor pool data. The document\n\ndescribing the 1990–92 MLAAP includes several analyses of the State Department workforce,\n\nand which job categories had a “manifest imbalance” for which groups. See Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 45–53a (Multi-Year Affirmative Action Plan FY 1990–92) (Shea – 00108–33). In\n\nmaking these comparisons, officials compared State employment data from FY 1989 and 1990\n\nwith the most recent Occupational National Civilian Labor Force Data for Public Administration\n\nAdministrators and Officials. See id. at 47 (Shea – 00116). The analysis of Foreign Service\n\n\n7\n  This may be a generous reading of Table 2.3, but that is what is required at this stage. State does not need to\nconvince the Court that its plan was lawful. To meet its burden of production, “[t]he employer ‘need not persuade\nthe court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons. It is sufficient if the defendant’s evidence raises a\ngenuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.’” Antrum, 710 F. Supp. at 118–19 (quoting\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 254–55).\n\n                                                          27\n\fGeneralists showed a “manifest imbalance” for “White females, Black males, Black females,\n\nHispanic females, American Indian males, [and] American Indian females.” Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot. 47 (Shea – 00116). The document also showed that within the Senior Foreign\n\nService “minority officers were promoted at a lower rate (3.7 percent) than White males (8.8\n\npercent) or White females (9.0 percent).” Id. at 74 (Shea – 00153). Minorities were also\n\npromoted from the lower-levels to the mid-levels—and within the mid-levels—at a lower rate\n\nthan white men or women. Id. While the data showed that minorities were promoted from class\n\nFS-01 8 to the Senior Foreign Service at a marginally higher rate, id., the plan warned that:\n\n        It is important to note, however, that promotion rates at the senior levels are based\n        on a very small number of eligible minorities and White women. For example,\n        Black females were promoted to the Senior Foreign Service at a 33-percent rate (2\n        of 6) compared with an 11-percent rate for White males (170 of 1,518).\n\nId. at 75 (Shea – 00154). The fact that there were so few minorities even eligible for promotion\n\ninto the Senior Foreign Service skewed the statistics regarding promotion rates.\n\n        “Over-inclusiveness” charges can also be levied at the 1990 data. The 1990–92 plan\n\ndocument does not show that all minority groups eligible for the MLAAP were in fact\n\nunderrepresented in the mid-levels.         However, this does not necessarily undermine State’s\n\nevidentiary proffer. First, as detailed supra, mid-level minority hiring not only immediately\n\ncured imbalances in the mid-levels, but created more opportunities for minorities to ascend to the\n\nSenior Foreign Service. As the 1990–92 plan noted, very few minorities were eligible for\n\npromotion into the Senior Foreign Service. Id. Second, while the MLAAP was “open” to all\n\nEEO minority groups, the plan only established representation goals for groups for which it\n\nfound a “manifest imbalance.” See id. at 54 (for Foreign Service Generalists, establishing goals\n\nto increase the representation of white females, black males, black females, Hispanic females,\n\n8\n  FS-01 being the highest “mid-level” Foreign Service Officer class. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 11; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10\n(admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 11).\n\n                                                    28\n\fAmerican Indian males, and American Indian females—the same groups the plan identified\n\nearlier as being underrepresented) (Shea – 00134). Or as the defendant puts it, “the 1990–1992\n\nMLAAP corrected for the weakness identified by the GAO…and specifically identified the\n\nmanifest imbalance in each specific minority group within which Foreign Service ‘conal system’\n\n(Administrative, Consular, Economic and Political), as compared to the more timely data for a\n\ncomparator population, and then set goals for only those under-represented groups.” Def.’s\n\nReply ISO its Cross-Mot. Summ. J. 12 (“Def.’s Reply”), Oct. 3, 2012, ECF No. 133 (citing Ex. 2\n\nto Def.’s Cross-Mot 46–46b, 47–47a, 50–51b, 54, 61–67).\n\n                       b.      Showing of a predicate of discrimination\n\n       The bare numbers only tell one side of the story. State does rely solely on a statistical\n\nimbalance in the mid- and senior-levels.         It has also provided evidence regarding past\n\ndiscrimination in the Foreign Service and institutional and systemic barriers to minority\n\nadvancement. State has provided enough evidence to show a “predicate of discrimination”\n\nimplying the statistical imbalances are due in part to some past discrimination by State, rather\n\nthan simply reflecting societal discrimination. See Hammon, 826 F.3d at 74–75, 80–81.\n\n       State’s hiring and promotion practices had been the subject of many employment\n\ndiscrimination lawsuits. See Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign\n\nService (statement of Rep. Sikorski) (detailing history of discrimination suits against State,\n\nstating: “This is not a new phenomenon. The department has lost a lot of money in a variety of\n\nlitigation regarding discrimination.”). State, and the Foreign Service in particular, drew the ire of\n\nCongress. The Thomas and Bremer Reports, discussed supra, went beyond calculating rates of\n\nminority representation.    With a particular emphasis on the Foreign Service, the reports\n\nexamined which practices contributed to—and exacerbated—minority underrepresentation. The\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\freports identified systemic and procedural barriers to minority hiring and advancement. See\n\nThomas Comm. Report; Bremer Study Group Report; The Department of State in the 21st\n\nCentury (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry Sikorski). These findings were echoed by officials\n\nfrom the GAO, who concluded that “some of State’s hiring, promotion, and assignment\n\nprocesses have a disproportionate effect on minorities and women.” Underrepresentation of\n\nWomen and Minorities in the Foreign Service, (statement of Joseph Kelly, Director, Security &\n\nInt’l Affairs Div., GAO). These reports focused on recent issues—not, as in Hammon, issues\n\nburied deep in the past. 826 F.3d at 77–78 (employer may not rely on findings of discrimination\n\nfrom decades ago, but should justify its plan with evidence of more recent discrimination).\n\n       Prior to the adoption of the 1990–92 MLAAP, some officials concluded that the Foreign\n\nService was “discriminatory.” For example, Rep. Sikorski, Chairman of the House Civil Service\n\nSubcommittee, held a hearing on September 22, 1989, titled, “Underrepresentation of Women\n\nand Minorities in the Foreign Service.” See Ex. 4 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. In his introductory\n\nremarks, Rep. Sikorski called the Foreign Service an “old-boys club,” and cited a litany of\n\nstudies and lawsuits charging the State Department with discrimination. Id. He noted that “[t]he\n\nnecessity and extent of legal action [against State] raises serious questions about the\n\ndepartment’s commitment to creating a workplace free of discrimination.” Id. For example,\n\nfrom 1976 to 1986, over 240 EEO cases were filed against State; and in 1985, 1986, and 1987\n\nthe State Department violated a consent decree it voluntarily entered into to settle an earlier\n\ndiscrimination suit. Id. Rep. Sikorski noted that the minorities and women who were hired into\n\nthe Foreign Service were disproportionally placed into less prestigious jobs, from which\n\nadvancement to the senior-levels was more difficult. Id. In a later hearing, Rep. Sikorski stated\n\nthat, in addition to the findings of the Bremer and Thomas Reports, “[i]nvestigations and\n\n\n\n                                               30\n\fhearings conducted by the Subcommittee of the Civil Service have also documented serious\n\ninstances of discriminatory treatment by the Foreign Service of women, minorities, and people\n\nwith handicaps.” The Department of State in the 21st Century (prepared statement of Rep. Gerry\n\nSikorski) (going on to list specific findings of discrimination in the Foreign Service).\n\n       Several of the witnesses who appeared before the congressional subcommittee—those\n\nwith first-hand knowledge of the workings of State—testified about discrimination in the Foreign\n\nService.   See, e.g., Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared testimony of Mary Lee Garrison, Co-President, State Dep’t Chapter, Women’s Action\n\nOrg.) (“Instances of blatant sexism and discrimination have declined, although some still take\n\nplace, but a simple glance at the statistics contained in the recent GAO report…will confirm the\n\ncontinued existence of a problem.”); Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the\n\nForeign Service (prepared statement of Clarence E. Hodges, Member, Management Council of\n\nthe Dep’t of State) (Calling some of State’s positions on its equal opportunity promotion\n\n“indefensible,” citing “too little progress and unacceptable behavior in this regard.” All around\n\nthe world, Mr. Hodges “encountered complaints of discrimination from our employees and\n\ncriticisms from foreigners for that same discrimination as exhibited by our predominately white\n\nmale diplomatic corps.”); Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared testimony of Charles Hughes Jr., Vice President for the State Dep’t Thursday\n\nLuncheon Group) (“I entered on duty in State in late 1965 and had my first experience with\n\ndiscrimination, aside from what I had experienced while stationed in the South. …[W]hile there\n\nare some very good, progressive minded people at State, there are also those who find it much\n\neasier to deny fair treatment to some, and thus keep faith with their peers.” *** “Minorities\n\n\n\n\n                                                 31\n\fhave been underrepresented purposely, and the rationale of improperly applied statistics, have\n\nprovided the relief for the consciences of the establishment.”).\n\n       When the Court looks at the whole picture—statistical findings of minority\n\nunderrepresentation and lower promotion rates, history of discrimination lawsuits, reports\n\nfinding systemic flaws at State, repeated congressional oversight and criticism, testimony from\n\nknowledgeable witnesses that the Foreign Service was discriminatory—it finds that State has met\n\nits evidentiary proffer of showing a proper factual predicate for its affirmative action plan.   It\n\nhas provided enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the MLAAP was justified\n\nby correcting a manifest imbalance in the mid- and senior-levels of the Foreign Service, and it\n\nserved to remedy the lingering effects of State’s past discrimination.\n\n               2.      Avoiding Unnecessarily Trammeling the Interests of Non-Minorities\n\n       Even if there is a manifest imbalance in the workplace, State must still design and\n\nimplement its affirmative action plan in a way that does not unnecessarily trammel the interests\n\nof non-minorities or create an absolute bar to the advancement of non-minorities. Weber, 443\n\nU.S. at 208; Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81. The plan must consider race-neutral alternatives and be\n\ncarefully tailored to remedy the problem at hand. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81. It must be a\n\ntemporary measure designed to “eliminate a manifest racial imbalance” rather than “maintain a\n\nracial balance.” Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. The plan should pay special attention to how it\n\naccomplishes its goals, and the extent to which its methods burden non-minorities. Johnson, 480\n\nU.S. at 616, 637–38. Courts prefer flexible, case-by-case approaches over rigid quota systems.\n\nSee, e.g., id. at 631–32; Paradise, 480 U.S. at 177–78 (plurality opinion), 188 (Powell, J.,\n\nconcurring); Local 28, Sheet Metal Workers v.

Cf. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81 (“[B]ecause available race-neutral\n\nalternatives were not considered, the District’s race-based hiring methods were not properly\n\ntailored to its remedial purposes.”).

If the\n\nemployer believes these programs, alone, cannot yield acceptable results, it may consider race-\n\nconscious hiring and promotion policies. The employer should not give the race of the applicant\n\nmore “weight” than is necessary to meet the goals. Hammon, 826 F.3d at 81 (“Johnson does\n\nnothing to disturb the longstanding requirement that the remedy crafted to cure a violation must\n\nbe tailored to fit the violation.” (citing Sheet Metal Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111747\"><a href=\"/opinion/111747/sheet-metal-workers-v-eeoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">421</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">)).\n\n          State’s evidence shows it had implemented its affirmative action plan after its past\n\nrecruitment and outreach plans were found lacking. Studies found that State’s efforts throughout\n\nthe 1980s to increase minority representation were not satisfactory and were progressing too\n\nslowly.     See, e.g., Underrepresentation of Minorities and Women in the Foreign Service\n\n(prepared statement of Joseph Kelly, Director of Security & Int’l Rel. Issues, Nat’l Security &\n\nInt’l Affairs Div., GAO). “[T]he EEOC repeatedly pointed out that the State Department has not\n\nhad an effective affirmative action plan or program for overcoming the underrepresentation in\n\nthe Foreign Service.” Id. at 1 (Shea – 008662). The State Department adopted minority mid-\n\nlevel hiring after repeated prodding by Congress, the EEOC, and other government entities. See\n\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\fgenerally Underrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service; The\n\nDepartment of State in the 21st Century.\n\n       As discussed supra, there may be some initial concerns over whether the program was\n\nproperly tailored. Courts have expressed concern over affirmative action plans that provide\n\npreferences to all minorities, whether or not all of those groups were underrepresented in the\n\nemployer’s workforce.      See, e.g., Alexander v. Estepp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726073\"><a href=\"/opinion/726073/marc-alexander-timothy-clark-george-frye-robert-a-moore-angela-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (4th Cir. 1996)\n\n(invalidating, under constitutional standard, affirmative action plan because it benefited all\n\nminority groups rather than merely discriminated-against African Americans). The 1990–92\n\nMLAAP waived the “certificate of need” requirement for some minority groups that were not\n\nfound to be underrepresented in the mid-levels. As explained in greater detail supra, this “over-\n\ninclusiveness” is not fatal when the 1990–92 MLAAP only set minority hiring goals where State\n\nhad found a manifest imbalance, and State had found across-the-board minority\n\nunderrepresentation in the Senior Foreign Service. The MLAAP involved case-by-case, targeted\n\nrecruitment of exceptional minority candidates, and considered the enhanced need for candidates\n\nfrom particular minority groups and backgrounds. See, e.g., Ex. 1b to Def.’s Cross-Mot.\n\n                      b.      Whether the plan is “temporary” in design and fact\n\n       Whether or not the affirmative action plan is “temporary” is another important factor to\n\nconsider. Courts favor temporary plans to attain racial balance and disfavor indefinite plans to\n\nmaintain such a balance. Plans that remain in effect long after the employer achieves the desired\n\nbalance seem less about remedying the lingering effects of past discrimination, and more about\n\npermanently providing special protections to certain groups. See, e.g., Taxman v. Board of Educ.\n\nof Tp. of Piscataway, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"723911\"><a href=\"/opinion/723911/sharon-taxman-plaintiff-intervenor-v-board-of-education-of-the-township/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1564 (3d Cir. 1996).

See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639–40\n\n(“Express assurance that a program is only temporary may be necessary if the program actually\n\nsets aside positions according to specific numbers.”).\n\n       State introduced sufficient evidence to show the MLAAP was temporary in fact and by\n\ndesign. When State originally adopted the MLAAP, it stated that its “new Mid-Level program\n\nwill be a temporary supplement to, and adjunct of, the Junior Officer Program,” and “will be\n\nappraised annually to determine whether it needs to be continued[.]” Ex. 1b to Def.’s Cross-\n\nMot. 3 (Shea – 008649). In fact, the MLAAP underwent continuous monitoring to determine\n\nwhether the plan was meeting its goals, and whether race-based preferences continued to be\n\nnecessary to meet those goals. See 1986–87 FRAA, Pub L. 99–33, Title I, § 152(c) (Congress\n\nrequired annual reports on the “progress being made increasing, through advancement and\n\npromotion, the numbers of members of minority groups and women in the mid-levels of the\n\nForeign Service.”); Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot.

Whether the plan forecloses opportunities for\n                              non-minority hiring and advancement\n\n       Another factor to consider is whether the MLAAP forecloses opportunities for non-\n\nminority hiring and advancement. See, e.g., Johnson, 480 U.S. at 637–38. The MLAAP did not\n\nimpose an “absolute bar” on non-minority “advancement.” Id. At all relevant times, State had a\n\ngeneral mid-level hiring program open to white males—the Mid-Level Foreign Service Career\n\nCandidate Program. See, e.g., Exs. 1A & 1B to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (1982 and 1987 Mid-Level\n\nForeign Service Career Candidate Programs). The eligibility requirements for this program were\n\nthe same as the MLAAP, except an applicant under the MLCCP needed an individual\n\ncertification of a “need for an outside hire at the grade and in the functional field…in which the\n\nperson is applying.” Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5 (March 19, 1993 Foreign Service Mid-Level\n\nHiring Program Highlights); see also Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–11\n\n(admitting in all relevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 10, 12–17). While the challenged affirmative\n\naction plan was in effect, several non-minority candidates were placed into mid-level positions\n\nthrough the MLCCP. See Ex. 16 to Def.’s Cross-Mot.; Def’s SMF ¶¶ 27–36; Pl.’s SMF Resp.\n\n14–16 (admitting in all relevant respects Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 27–36).\n\n       Moreover, Shea could progress to the mid-levels through the ordinary course of\n\npromotions. The MLAAP did not bar Shea from reaching the mid-levels but—by Shea’s own\n\nadmission—served to delay his ascension into the mid-levels. See Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 27–36.\n\n                                               36\n\fShea has, in fact, been promoted to the mid-levels of the Foreign Service; at the time of his\n\nComplaint, Shea was at grade FS-03, step 5. See Compl. ¶ 6(c). Several courts have approved\n\nof plans that delay, but do not bar, promotion opportunities. See, e.g., Paradise, 480 U.S. at 183\n\n(“‘Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job,’ and\n\nplainly postponement [of a promotion] imposes a lesser burden still.” (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S.\n\nat 283)) (plurality opinion); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 638 (“[P]etitioner had no absolute entitlement\n\nto the” higher-level job. “Thus, denial of the promotion unsettled no legitimate, firmly rooted\n\nexpectation on part of the petitioner.

The MLAAP involved hiring goals, and in such cases:\n\n       [T]he burden to be borne by innocent individuals is diffused to a considerable\n       extent among society generally. Though hiring goals may burden some innocent\n       individuals, they simply do not impose the same kind of injury that layoffs\n       impose. Denial of a future employment opportunity is not as intrusive as loss of\n       an existing job.\n\nWygant, 476 U.S. at 283–83.       State’s minority-hiring goals were not accompanied by any\n\nminority-hiring quotas—State was not required to hire a particular number of minorities. See Ex.\n\n2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5, (March 19, 1993 Foreign Service Mid-Level Hiring Program\n\n                                                37\n\fHighlights: “Our hiring goal each year for the affirmative action mid-level program has been\n\nabout twenty. As you will observe by the hiring statistics…we have not come close to our\n\ntarget.”). At no time did State bind itself to hire a certain number of minorities each year; State\n\nnoted that it was focused the quality of its minority candidates, not the quantity it could hire. See\n\nEx. 1b to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (“Success will be measured by the quality of the future mid-level\n\ncandidates hired, and their subsequent performance in the Foreign Service, rather than by\n\nwhether or not specific numerical hiring goals are met each year[.]”).\n\n       State thoroughly vetted minority candidates, taking far more than thier race into account.\n\nThe MLAAP required “pre-certification based on a file review, an oral assessment conducted by\n\nthe staff of the Board of Examiners and the normal background investigation, medical\n\nexamination and Final Review to determine suitability for appointment to the Foreign Service.”\n\nEx. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 5. The MLAAP candidate must have had a “bachelor’s degree from\n\nan accredited college or university;” “six additional years of professional level education and/or\n\nprofessional work experience of which three years must have been in an area related to the\n\nprospective Foreign Service functional field;” and “supervisory/managerial skills.” Id. The\n\nMLAAP did not assign a set “point” value to minority status.\n\n       The MLAAP was “identical” to the more general mid-level hiring program, except that\n\nmembership in a minority group substituted for an individual certificate of need. Id. Once those\n\nqualified minority candidates applied, they were subject to the same rigorous process as non-\n\nminority applicants. See Ex. 7 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Nov. 1990 State document describing the\n\nrequirements and application process for both the MLCCP and MLAAP). Cf. Johnson, 480 U.S.\n\nat 638 (approving of plans that “consider[] race along with other criteria”); Hammon, 826 F.3d at\n\n79–80 (agreeing with Johnson’s approval of a “‘moderate, flexible, case-by-case approach’” and\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fstressing need for sufficient “screening considerations” to avoid “‘mere bling hiring by the\n\nnumbers’” (quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636–37)). 9\n\n        While State was interested in increasing the number of minority Foreign Service officers,\n\nit strongly emphasized the quality and accomplishments of its minority recruits. The 1990–92\n\nMLAAP plan document says that “State is committed to forging a workforce that fully represents\n\nthe American diversity without sacrificing excellence.” Ex. 2 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 61 (Shea –\n\n00140). The 1990–92 MLAAP aimed to “emphasize selective recruiting of potential candidates\n\non a one-by-one basis[.]” Id. The refined plan concentrated “on quality candidates who are\n\nunquestionably successful in their current careers and who have been individually recommended\n\nby people who know both the candidate and the requirements of the Foreign Service.” Id. This\n\nwas done despite State’s knowledge that it was “dramatically reduc[ing]” the “number of\n\n[minority] applications processed.” Id.\n\n        State proffers evidence that it screened out many interested minority candidates who did\n\nnot meet the requirements. Id. State submits evidence that it did not place at least two eligible\n\nminority applicants in mid-level positions after those candidates applied. Decl. of Alina Eldred\n\n¶¶ 4–11.

Shea, however, had an opportunity to apply for direct mid-level placement through the\nMLCCP, which was substantially identical to the MLAAP. See Ex. 7 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (describing, in detail,\nrequirements of both programs). At times, State has spoken of them as if they were two parts of the same program:\n        The Mid-Level Foreign Service Career Candidate Program is designed to hire office candidates at\n        the ranks of FP–3, 2 and 1 to supplement the number of Career Foreign Service Officers already in\n        those grades, in accordance with the needs of the Foreign Service. The need is either specific—\n        for an offer at the grade and in the cone which an applicant is seeking to enter; or general—for\n        minority group members under the Department’s Affirmative Action Program to achieve\n        greater representativeness un the Foreign Service.\nId. at Shea – 3448 (emphasis added). Shea’s argument trades heavily on semantic differences—i.e., it doesn’t\nmatter that I was eligible for the MLCCP, because I was ineligible for the MLAAP—rather than focusing on the true\nnature of the program, and considering whether it unfairly shut out or burdened non-minorities.\n\n                                                       39\n\flevel minorities per year…, less than 6 minorities per year were placed in the mid-levels of the\n\nForeign Service, totaling approximately 29 minorities (male and female) during the five-year\n\nperiod of the MLAAP’s existence.”); Pl.’s SMF Resp. 13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 19).\n\n        State has met its burden of production that it properly tailored its affirmative action plan\n\nso that it would not unnecessarily trammel the interests of non-minorities.\n\n        C.       Shea’s Attempt to Prove that the Affirmative Action Plan is Invalid\n\n        With State meeting its burden of production, Shea must offer sufficient, potentially\n\nadmissible 10 evidence that the MLAAP was unlawful—that State’s proffered evidence is not\n\nworthy of credence and State illegally discriminated against white males. If Shea fails to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact with admissible evidence, State will prevail. If there is a failure of\n\nproof by Shea, State does not have to affirmatively and ultimately prove that the MLAAP is\n\nlawful.

Id. at\n\n12–13. See also Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (Shea’s edited copy of the plan, with additional\n\ncharts created by Shea). Second, he added “the numbers for male and female officers of each\n\nrace…to determine totals for any given race at any given grade.” Id. at 13. He then used the\n\nNCLF Public Administrator figures, available at page 47a of the plan, as his comparator group.\n\nId. (citing Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. at 47a (Shea – 00177)).

He concludes that “whites were underrepresented in the Foreign\n\nService mid-level grades,” as “[w]hites comprised 85.58 of the Foreign Service mid-level\n\nofficers” but “comprised 86.1 percent of the Public Administrator” comparator pool.

How Shea’s Analysis Differs From State’s\n\n       Congress, the GAO, and State had long railed against the overrepresentation of white\n\nmales in the Foreign Service, especially at its mid- and senior-levels. See supra Parts I.A., III.B.\n\nBut Shea shows—using State’s own numbers—that whites were actually underrepresented in the\n\nForeign Service mid-levels. See Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3. What explains this difference? Shea has\n\nwidened the comparator pool.       Shea concedes that white males were overrepresented, but\n\ndismisses this fact as “irrelevant.” Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply. 7. To Shea, the relevant question isn’t\n\nwhether white males are overrepresented, but whether whites as a whole are overrepresented.\n\nState provided numbers broken down by both race and gender, see generally Ex. 2 to Def.’s\n\nCross-Mot., but Shea combined the gender figures for each race to determine the rates of\n\nrepresentation by race only, rather than by race and gender, see Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 12–27.\n\nInstead of comparing white males to white women, black males, et cetera, Shea simply compares\n\nwhites to blacks, Asians, Hispanics, et cetera. When the numbers are looked at this way, Shea\n\nargues, one finds that whites are actually underrepresented in the mid-levels, and thus the\n\nMLAAP cannot have any legitimate remedial purpose. Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3, 12–27.\n\n       State raises questions about Shea’s analysis, claiming Shea “manipulated the data in his\n\nMemorandum of Points and Authorities by combining the population of White male employees\n\n(who were significantly over-represented) with White female employees (who were grossly\n\nunder-represented).” Def.’s Cross-Mot. 14. State argues that since “the initial Congressional\n\nmandate (comparing White males with all other race/gender groups)” and State had\n\n“implemented programs to address the racial/gender disparities,” Shea’s “decision to focus on\n\nrace alone makes no sense, other than as an attempt to ‘smooth out’ the difference and thereby\n\n‘create’ an entirely new parameter of facts to support his position.” Id. at 14–15.\n\n\n\n                                                42\n\f       State’s position has some support.        First, the evidence suggests that Congress was\n\nconcerned specifically with white male overrepresentation, rather than the overrepresentation of\n\nwhites generally. See, e.g., 1986–87 FRAA, Pub. L. 99–33; 1988–89 FRAA, Pub. L. 100–204;\n\nUnderrepresentation of Women and Minorities in the Foreign Service—State Department:\n\nHearing Before the Subcomm. on the Civil Service of the H. Comm. on Post Office and Civil\n\nService, 101st Cong. (1989). Second, State had separate programs aimed at increasing female\n\nrepresentation. See Def.’s SMF ¶ 4; Pl.’s SMF Resp. (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 4). Third, courts\n\nhave been suspicious of efforts to distort the data by inflating or artificially restricting the\n\ncomparator groups. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 636 (“[H]ad the Plan simply calculated imbalances\n\nin all categories according to the proportion of women in the area labor pool, and then directed\n\nthat hiring be governed solely by those figures, its validity fairly could be called into question.”);\n\nSmith v.

This is the Court’s best guess, based on\n\nscattered comments from Shea’s briefs: Since the MLAAP is not open to white women, the\n\nunderrepresentation of white women is not relevant to justifying the MLAAP.                Since the\n\nMLAAP excluded Shea because of his race, rather than his gender, the pertinent question is\n\nwhether whites—rather than white males—were overrepresented in the mid-levels of the Foreign\n\nService. In his opposition brief, Shea does not fully address State’s challenges to using whites as\n\nthe comparator pool. He seems to misunderstand State’s argument, stating: “The defense\n\n\n\n                                                 43\n\femphasis on how ‘grossly’ overrepresented white males were in 1987 seems part of an effort to\n\nconvince the court to add an element to a Title VII claim asserting a lawful [affirmative action\n\nplan]: that the plaintiff was part of a group that was under-represented in the workforce.” Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n & Reply 8. State responds that it “has never alleged that the Plaintiff ‘lacks standing’ to\n\nraise a claim merely because he is a member of an over-represented group in the workplace,” and\n\nfinds no explanation as to why Shea combined white males and females in his analysis. Def.’s\n\nReply 5. The Court agrees that it is not entirely clear why Shea chooses this comparator pool.\n\n       What should be clear, however, is that Shea is engaging in a new statistical analysis. He\n\nis changing the comparator group that State used to justify its affirmative action plan, and\n\nrecalculating rates of representation based on Shea’s preferred comparator groups. State raises\n\nserious concerns about Shea’s methods and use of comparator pools. Without deciding whether\n\nState’s criticisms are valid, the Court notes that the questions they raise are serious and have not\n\nbeen adequately addressed by Shea, as the following analysis will show.\n\n               3.      Shea Conducts a Statistical Analysis He is Not Competent to Perform\n\n       Essentially, Shea performs a statistical analysis of State’s data to show that there was, in\n\nfact, no “manifest imbalance” in the Foreign Service. Whether or not Shea needs an expert to\n\nperform this analysis, it is clear that Shea has not adequately explained his methods or\n\ndemonstrated the statistical significance of his results. His analysis of State’s racial over- and\n\nunderrepresentation is not, and is not capable of being transformed into, admissible evidence.\n\n                       a.     Courts demand some evidence of the statistical significance\n                              of statistics, often presented via an expert witness\n\n       The case law in this circuit overwhelmingly finds that this kind of analysis requires proof\n\nas to its statistical significance.

Cir. 1988), the D.C. Circuit made the fundamental statement that while the use of\n\n                                                44\n\fstatistical analysis has “become routine” and “well accepted” in discrimination cases, “[a]\n\nstatistical calculation relies on a number of underlying assumptions, the validity of which can\n\noften be assessed only by those with experience in the field.” In Frazier, the plaintiffs did not\n\nuse “an expert to explain the statistical calculations to the district court,” but submitted raw data\n\nabout disparate treatment and “several results of numerical calculation performed by counsel.”\n\nId. “These calculations were all done according to widely known methods previously reported in\n\nother discrimination cases, regulations and commentaries” and included a “Z statistic”\n\ncalculation to explain the statistical significance of the results. Id. While not deciding whether\n\nexpert witnesses are required for this kind of analysis, the D.C. Circuit stressed the importance of\n\nverifying the significance of the statistics, and upheld the district court’s evidentiary findings:\n\n       We are not prepared to say that the Z statistic calculation is so simple and straight\n       forward that an expert is never required to explain it to a finder of fact. Nor do\n       we wish to be understood as holding that an expert is always required. We leave\n       both possibilities open because it would be impossible to anticipate the impact of\n       this theory upon every conceivable factual situation. We believe that in the\n       factual context of this case, the district court made a valid finding that the\n       plaintiffs’ proffered statistics were not sufficiently presented to make out a prima\n       facie case of adverse impact.\n\nId. at 1453.\n\n       Courts in this Circuit have continued to require evidence of statistical significance—often\n\nprovided by experts—before giving any weight to proffered statistics.

Supp. 2d at 8–28.11 Looking at Shea’s analysis,\n\nthis Court has several fundamental, threshold questions. Why does Shea continue to use the\n\n1980 numbers for the relevant comparator pool, see Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. 3, 12–14, even though\n\nthe GAO report containing those numbers explicitly disclaimed their reliability, and more recent\n\nnumbers were available? See Ex. 3 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. 21 (Shea – 008695). Why is it\n\nappropriate for Shea to combine while males and while females, and recalculate the\n\nunderrepresentation figures by race only? Isn’t Shea simply inflating the comparator group to\n\n11\n  This presents another way to look at this issue: In comparison with the detailed, searching analysis used in Berger\nand McReynolds, it is clear that Shea’s statistical analysis—expert or not—cannot pass muster.\n\n                                                         46\n\fdiminish the rate of white male overrepresentation? How, and why, has Shea recalculated the\n\nrates of underrepresentation?       Has he done so pursuant to standard, generally accepted\n\nprocedures? Are his results statistically significant? What is the error rate? How does Shea\n\nmeasure statistical significance and error rates?\n\n       The Court needs to answer these questions before it can determine the relevance,\n\nreliability, and probative value of Shea’s calculations—and thus their admissibility. See Frazier,\n\n851 F.2d at 1452 (“Statistical comparisons performed on data in discrimination cases are not\n\nprobative of anything without support from an underlying statistical theory.”). Shea does not\n\nadequately answer these questions. “[T]he statistics must be made meaningful to the finder of\n\nfact in order to permit the plaintiff[] to carry [his] burden of showing that [his] statistics are\n\nsignificant.” Id. at 1453. Even if Shea did not necessarily need an expert to conduct his\n\nanalysis—as left open by Frazier, 851 F.2d at 1453—this Court finds that plaintiff’s proffered\n\nstatistics were not sufficiently presented to withstand the scrutiny this Court must apply in\n\ndetermining their relevance and reliability, cf. id.\n\n                       c.      Shea’s analysis is not as simple and modest as he claims\n\n       Shea claims that his analysis simply relies on numbers provided in State’s own\n\ndocuments. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 9–10, 13, 25. A simple examination of plaintiff’s Exhibit\n\n2 shows that he is not merely pointing to State’s analysis and why it cannot support State’s\n\nposition. Instead he combines different sets of State’s numbers—merging the figures for males\n\nand females—and recalculating overrepresentation rates based on what Shea thinks should be the\n\nrelevant comparator. See Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot. Summ. J. (plaintiff-created charts at pages 11, 12,\n\n13, 15, 16, 17). He, in essence, changes the comparator groups without a sufficient explanation\n\nfor the change, and without a background in the kinds of “pools” analysis frequently done by\n\n\n\n                                                    47\n\fstatisticians in Title VII cases.

Supp. 2d at 9 (same).\n\n       Shea claims that, in so recalculating the overrepresentation numbers, he is doing simple\n\nmath—that he does not need any advanced degrees or specialized knowledge to add, subtract,\n\nmultiply, and divide. See Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 16–17, 25–31. Certainly, a big part of what most\n\nstatisticians do boils down to simple math. But statisticians are not experts because they are\n\nparticularly adept at math—the Court suspects that many use performance-enhancing calculators.\n\nStatisticians are experts because they know which numbers to use, and what functions to apply to\n\neach set of numbers. In this case, the relevant expertise is not simply applying elementary\n\nschool-level math to sets of numbers found within the defendant’s documents. It is knowing, out\n\nof the different sets of numbers spread throughout State’s reports, which sets of numbers to\n\ncompare and how to compare them. It is being able to explain whether a disparity between\n\nwhites and minorities is statistically significant, and whether the results have accounted for\n\n“noise” that may skew the numbers. See, e.g., Berger, 843 F.2d at 1411–23; Frazier, 851 F.2d at\n\n1452; McReynolds, 349 F. Supp. 2d at 8–28.\n\n                      d.     Shea is not qualified to offer expert or lay opinion testimony\n\n       Shea’s numbers are irrelevant without some explanation of their significance. Shea\n\nmight need an expert to opine on the statistical significance of the recalculated\n\nunderrepresentation figures. See Chao, 65 Fed. Appx. at 324. Without even considering Shea’s\n\nqualifications, Shea could not provide expert testimony because he did not disclose his\n\ntestimony—per Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26—by the deadlines imposed by the Court.\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\fSee Revised Scheduling Order 2, July 6, 2010, ECF No. 84 (setting expert deadline as September\n\n30, 2010). Shea had ample opportunity to designate an expert, and was aware of the relevant\n\ndeadlines when he asked for—and received—extensions of the expert disclosure and discovery\n\ndeadlines. See, e.g., Minute Entry, Sept. 22, 2009; Minute Entry, Dec. 18, 2009; Pl.’s Mot. for\n\nDiscovery Extension, June 28, 2010, ECF No. 81. Shea’s unexcused and inexcusable failure to\n\ntimely designate an expert per the Court’s deadlines disqualifies him as an “expert,” and makes\n\nhis calculations and conclusions inadmissible to the extent they require expert testimony.\n\n        Shea cannot present “lay” opinion testimony as to the statistical significance of his\n\nfindings. Such testimony typically involves disclosed experts and is thus not amenable to lay\n\nexpert analysis. See Fed. R. Evid. 701(c) (forbidding lay opinion testimony “based on scientific,\n\ntechnical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702”). Lay opinion testimony\n\n“‘is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the\n\nwitness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of\n\na fact in issue.’” United States v.

The party offering the statistics must articulate how the\n\ndata should be interpreted and why it supports the party’s position. Saunders, 191 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n133. The party must “demonstrate that the data []he offers is statistically significant,” Haley, 786\n\nF. Supp. at 1063, and explain how the numbers reflect discrimination (or a lack thereof) rather\n\nthan, for example, “incomprehensive statistical treatment, varying levels of qualifications among\n\napplicants, errors in definition or groups, inappropriate sampling methods, errors in\n\nmeasurement, or even clerical and computational errors,” Frazier, 851 F.2d at 1452.\n\n         As in Frazier, id. at 1453, Shea’s statistics are not “sufficiently presented;” Shea cannot\n\nexplain his methods and assumptions such that his statistics are “meaningful to the trier of fact in\n\norder to permit” him to carry his burden of “showing that [his] statistics are significant.” 13 He\n\ninflates the comparator pool without an adequate justification for using this larger pool. He\n\nprovides no explanation of whether his recalculated rates of overrepresentation are statistically\n\nsignificant, per any generally accepted measure. He does not even attempt a standard deviation\n\nor “Z statistic” calculation. He does not even reference—let alone explain how he relied on—\n\n“widely known methods previously reported in other discrimination cases, regulations, and\n\n\n\n13\n  From the D.C.

He gives the Court none of the information it would need to make a\n\nthreshold determination of the relevance, reliability, and admissibility of his amateur statistics.\n\n       Courts often give pro se litigants more slack than represented parties—for example,\n\nCourts may be more generous in construing pro se complaints when considering a motion to\n\ndismiss.

This generosity does not extend, however, to\n\nallowing Shea to provide his own opinions where expert testimony is needed, or subjecting\n\nShea’s statistical methods to far less scrutiny than any other litigant would face.\n\n                       f.      State is not required to offer expert testimony to meet its burden\n\n       Shea argues that it is unfair to ask him to use experts to show that a manifest imbalance\n\ndid not justify the MLAAP, but not require State to use experts to show that there was such a\n\nmanifest imbalance. Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 7–8, 31–35. Requiring State—as a condition of\n\nmeeting its burden of production—to retain outside experts to verify that State designed the\n\nMLAAP to correct for a manifest imbalance would severely undermine the allocation of burdens\n\nestablished in McDonnell Douglas and Johnson. Johnson, read liberally, might suggest that the\n\nmere production of an affirmative action plan could meet the employer’s burden under\n\nMcDonnell Douglas. See 480 U.S. at 627 (“Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case that\n\nrace or sex has been taken into account in an employer’s employment decision, the burden shifts\n\nto the employer to articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision. The existence of an\n\naffirmative action plan provides such a rationale. If such a plan is articulated as the basis for the\n\nemployer’s decision, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to prove that the employer's justification is\n\npretextual and the plan is invalid.”). State has done more than simply point to its affirmative\n\naction plan—it has provided evidence indicating its plan is lawful, justified by a need to remedy\n\n\n\n                                                 51\n\fa manifest imbalance, and properly tailored to those ends.           However, by submitting this\n\nevidence, State does not admit that it “carr[ies] the burden of proving the validity of the plan.\n\nThe burden of proving its invalidity remains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 627–28.\n\n       The Court admits that the law is not precise on exactly how much evidence an employer\n\nmust offer to defend its affirmative action plan. Cf. 2 LINDEMANN, GROSSMAN & WEIRICH,\n\nEMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LAW 2506–07 (“On the fact-specific issue as to what evidence is\n\nneeded to prove discrimination sufficient to undertake affirmative action, however, the lower\n\ncourts have not taken a consistent approach.”). Nevertheless, wherever the exact location of the\n\n“line” is, the Court is confident (as discussed supra in Part III.A.) that State’s proffered evidence\n\ngoes far beyond that line. Under current precedent—Johnson and its progeny—an employer is\n\nnot necessarily required to provide expert testimony to meet its burden of production.\n\n       The reports from the State Department, congressional subcommittees, and the GAO—\n\ncreated during the normal course of business—could be sufficient to establish the required\n\n“manifest imbalance” and “predicate of discrimination.”           See supra Part.III.B. (detailing\n\nevidence introduced by State). To authenticate and discuss the content of these reports, the\n\ndefendant would not necessarily need expert witnesses, or treat its party witnesses as such. See\n\nBarnes, __ F.

Shea’s Evidence that the MLAAP Forecloses Advancement\n                          Opportunities for Non-Minorities\n\n        Shea argues that the MLAAP, in effect, forecloses advancement opportunities for non-\n\nminorities. Shea claims he “was not aware of any mid-level hiring program that non-minorities\n\nwere eligible for when [he] applied for a job with the Foreign Service in 1990[.]” Pl.’s Opp’n to\n\nDef.’s Second Mot. Reconsideration 41, Apr. 12, 2011, ECF No. 95. While Shea’s subjective\n\nknowledge of the MLCCP may be relevant to mitigation of damages, it is not relevant in\n\nconsidering the legality of the MLAAP, as it is undisputed that such a general mid-level hiring\n\nprogram existed. Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 9–12, 22; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 10–13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 9–\n\n12, 22). Nevertheless, Shea claims that the MLCCP would have done him no good, as State was\n\nnot issuing certificates of need for his particular area of expertise. Shea says that no certificates\n\nof need were issued between January 1990 and the date he began with State, May 31, 1992. Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n & Reply 35. Shea continues, “The first mid-level white hiring comes on October 19,\n\n1992 – after I had started my employment with State.” Id. In support of this position, Shea cites\n\ndefense exhibit 16 (ECF No. 128-18), a chart entitled “Mid-Level Hiring 1990 to 1994.” This\n\nchart shows that State first hired Caucasian as a mid-level on October 19, 1992. 14\n\n\n\n14\n  This, of course, does not mean there were no white mid-level hires prior to October 1992. Construing this chart,\nthe Court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of Shea, and does feel the need to address whether there were\nnon-minority mid-level hires prior to this date.\nElsewhere State argues, “Due to the passage of time cause by Plaintiff’s nine-year delay in bringing this action and\nthe resulting loss of records, Defendant is unable to tell if any certificates of need were issued by the State\nDepartment in the fiscal years 1990 and 1991.” Def.’s Cross-Mot. 26 n.16. Since this is merely the ipse dixit of\ncounsel, unsupported by a sworn affidavit or admissible evidence, the Court ignores this argument entirely and\nfocuses on what can actually be shown by the evidence.

Certificates of need, as\n\nprerequisites to applying for a mid-level position, must be issued some time before an applicant\n\nis hired. Exs. 1A & 1B to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (1982 and 1987 Mid-Level Foreign Service Career\n\nCandidate Programs). Consider the case of Patricia Haslach, whom Shea cites as the non-\n\nminority candidate hired on October 19, 1992. Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply 35. According to a letter\n\nfrom Haslach to State, Haslach inquired about the MLCCP as early as December 12, 1990. Ex.\n\n17 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (Shea – 07538). On January 10, 1991, Haslach applied for a mid-level\n\nposition, id.; apparently it took approximately 22 months for her to be hired at State, see Def.’s\n\nSMF ¶¶ 28, 30–32; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 14–15 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶¶ 28, 30–32). This shows\n\nthat simply because no white mid-levels were hired until a few months after Shea entered State,\n\nthis does not mean no certificates of need were issued until after Shea entered State.\n\n       Shea next cites a November 30, 1992, memorandum sent to the State Department\n\nDirector General titled, “Minority Recruitment and Hiring.” Ex. 1 to Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply, ECF\n\nNo. 123-1. The memo states that “at present,” State was then “able to certify mid-level need for\n\nadmin, econ, and science officers at the 02 and 03 levels, and consular officers at the 02 levels.”\n\nEx. 1 to Pl.’s Opp’n & Reply (Shea – 03765). To Shea this means State was not issuing\n\ncertificates for consular officers at grade FS-3—the position he would have been interested in\n\nand qualified for—and therefore he was effectively shut out of the MLCCP. See Pl.’s Opp’n &\n\nReply 37. However, this conclusion does not follow from the memorandum. First, the memo\n\nonly concerns certificates of need as of November 1992, and says absolutely nothing about the\n\navailability of consular certificates prior to that date. In fact, prior to November 1992, State did\n\napprove of certificates of need for FS-03 consular officers. See Ex. 10 to Def.’s Cross-Mot. (on\n\n\n\n                                                54\n\fMay 14, 1992, approving of FS-03 consular certificates of need) (Shea – 07372). This May 1992\n\nState document undermines Shea’s interpretation of the November 1992 memorandum—simply\n\nbecause FS-03 consular certificates were not available in November 1992 does not mean they\n\nwere not available earlier, while Shea was applying for a position.\n\n       Overall, Shea does not present sufficient evidence to infer that was completely shut out of\n\nthe MLCCP or did not have an opportunity to reach the mid-levels. By his own admission, Shea\n\nnever inquired about the MLCCP, requested a certificate of need, or applied to the program.\n\nDef.’s SMF ¶ 22; Pl.’s SMF Resp. 13 (admitting Def.’s SMF ¶ 22); Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Second\n\nMot. Reconsideration 41. Applying for, and being rejected from, mid-level placement would be\n\nthe clearest evidence that he was not eligible for mid-level placement. At this point, Shea’s\n\nevidence is speculative at best and not sufficient to overcome State’s evidentiary proffer.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The role of a district court is to ascertain and apply the law as it is, not as the Court thinks\n\nit should be.     This Court finds that the Supreme Court’s majority opinion in Johnson v.\n\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111846\"><a href=\"/opinion/111846/johnson-v-transportation-agency-santa-clara-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">616</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987)—as it has been interpreted\n\nand applied in this Circuit—provides the controlling standard for analyzing Title VII challenges\n\nof affirmative action plans. Under Johnson, after the plaintiff has made a prima facie claim of\n\nracial discrimination, the defendant must only meet a burden of production—not persuasion—\n\nthat it acted pursuant to a legal affirmative action plan. The ultimate persuasive burden is, at all\n\ntimes, on the plaintiff to prove that the affirmative action plan was unlawful.            Under this\n\nstandard, Shea has failed to provide sufficient, admissible evidence that State’s affirmative action\n\nplan was not justified by a manifest imbalance in the workforce or properly tailored to achieve\n\nremedial goals.     In particular, Shea’s amateur statistics regarding the rates of minority\n\n\n\n                                                 55\n\frepresentation in the Foreign Service would be inadmissible, as Shea provides no evidence as to\n\nthe statistical significance of his results. Since Shea cannot prove an essential element of his\n\nclaim, and has had a full and fair opportunity obtain relevant discovery, the State Department is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Shea’s remaining claim.\n\n         For Shea, this may be a less than satisfying end to this long-running case. This Court is,\n\nin some ways, sympathetic. The Court wonders why it is harder to challenge an affirmative\n\naction plan under Title VII than under the Constitution. When challenging affirmative action\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause, strict scrutiny applies and the defendant has the ultimate\n\nburden of explaining why it was necessary to treat people differently based on their race. But\n\nwhen the challenge is under Title VII, we make the plaintiff ultimately prove that race-based\n\ndiscrimination is illegal. 15 The Court questions the wisdom of looking to legislative history to\n\ncreate a textual ambiguity, rather than resolve one—carving out exceptions from a clear mandate\n\nnot to discriminate because we imagine what legislators would have done, rather than focus on\n                                  16\nwhat they actually did.                Our affirmative action jurisprudence—both statutory and\n\nconstitutional—operates under the assumption that unambiguous mandates not to discriminate\n\nbased on race somehow apply with less force to members of the “majority.”\n\n\n\n\n15\n  See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626–27 (providing Title VII McDonnell Douglas burden shifting standard for analyzing\naffirmative action plans); Wygant, 476 U.S. at 273 (providing constitutional strict scrutiny standard for analyzing\naffirmative action plans; Johnson, 480 U.S. at 480 U.S. at 627 n.6 (majority opinion clarifying that statutory\nprocedure for analyzing affirmative action plans is indeed different from the constitutional test); Stewart, 948 F.\nSupp. at 1093 (“The standard for determining whether affirmative relief is justified under Title VII is less stringent\nthan under the Constitution.”).\n16\n   Our affirmative action jurisprudence has its origins in the backwards idea that the “spirit” of a law somehow\ntrumps its plain and unambiguous letter. In Weber and Johnson, the Supreme Court somehow found—in plain\nlanguage barring racial discrimination—an out to give racial preferences to minority groups. Certainly, the Court\nthought, it would be absurd for a law barring racial discrimination not to allow some. See generally Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 657–77 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

This Court cannot depart from long-standing, clear precedent based on such speculation.\nMany also thought—including this Judge in Stewart, 948 F. Supp. at 1094–95—there would be a significant change\nto affirmative action jurisprudence after City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989) and Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v.

See, e.g., Margaret A. Sewell, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena:\nThe Armageddon of Affirmative Action, 46 DEPAUL L. REV. 611 (1997); Lara Hudgins, Rethinking Affirmative\nAction in the 1990s: Tailoring the Cure to Remedy the Disease, 47 BAYLOR L. REV. 815 (1995); John Payton, The\nMeaning and Significance of the Croson Case, 1 GEO. MASON U. CIV. RTS. L.J. 59 (1990). This has yet to pass, as\nin the years since Croson and Adarand, the Supreme Court has yet to overrule Johnson and Weber. Cf. Neal\nDevins, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena and the Continuing Irrelevance of Supreme Court Affirmative Action\nDecisions, 37 WM. & MARY L. REV. 673 (1996) (arguing neither Croson or Adarand had effect many expected).\nOthers still thought that Parents Involved, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145702\"><a href=\"/opinion/145702/parents-involved-in-community-schools-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), sounded the death kneel for affirmative action. See\nKatherine M. Planer, The Death of Diversity? Affirmative Action in the Workplace After Parents Involved, 39 SETON\nHALL L. REV. 1333 (2009). While not much may be clear about affirmative action, the reports of its demise have\nbeen greatly exaggerated. Cf. Frank Marshall White, Mark Twain Amused / Humorist Says He Even Heard on Good\nAuthority That He Was Dead, N.Y. JOURNAL, June 2, 1897, at 1, reprinted in MARK TWAIN: THE COMPLETE\nINTERVIEWS 317–18 (Gary Scharnhorst ed., 2006).\n18\n  See, e.g., Ricci, 557 U.S. at 594–97 (Scalia, J., concurring); Johnson, 480 U.S. at 657–77 (Scalia, J., dissenting);\nHill v.
