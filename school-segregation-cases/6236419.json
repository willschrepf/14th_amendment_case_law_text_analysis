On\nappeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (“BTA”) affirmed the assessment in part and\nreversed the assessment in part.\n       {¶ 2} The BTA reversed the imposition of use tax on materials Accel\nacquired to be used and incorporated into gift sets, holding that the purchases were\nentitled to exemption under R.C. 5739.02(B)(42)(a) and 5739.01(R) because the\npreparation of the gift sets involved “assembling” or “assembly.” The BTA also\nreversed the imposition of use tax on certain transactions by which Accel obtained\n“employment services” through one of its suppliers, holding that the transactions\nwere exempt under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3), which exempts transactions involving the\nassignment of employees “on a permanent basis.” The tax commissioner appeals\nthese findings and asserts in conjunction with his appeal that the BTA should have\ndeferred to his own factual findings.\n       {¶ 3} In its cross-appeal, Accel contests the BTA’s ruling that no portion of\nthe assessment is time-barred by R.C. 5703.58(B). Accel also contends that the\nproduction of gift sets qualifies for exemption directly under the definition of\n“manufacturing operation” in R.C. 5739.01(S) and that the employment-services\ntransactions with a different supplier should also have been exempted.\n       {¶ 4} Finally, each party contests the BTA’s decision to admit into evidence\nthe report and testimony of the opposing party’s expert witness.\n       {¶ 5} Based on our review of the issues presented, the record before us, the\nbriefs, and the relevant case law, we conclude that the BTA acted reasonably and\nlawfully with respect to all of the contested findings. We therefore affirm the\ndecision of the BTA.\n                         COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS\n       {¶ 6} The tax commissioner issued a use-tax assessment against Accel on\nJanuary 18, 2011. Accel petitioned for reassessment, and the tax commissioner\nissued his final determination on June 26, 2012, stating the amount of unpaid use\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\ntax as $2,447,159.84, plus preassessment interest of $651,862.91 and a penalty of\n$122,357.99, for a total assessment of $3,221,380.74. Accel appealed to the BTA.\n       {¶ 7} The BTA held a hearing at which Accel presented the testimony of its\npresident, its cost-accounting manager, an expert on manufacturing, the tax\ndepartment’s audit agent, Accel’s chief financial officer, and the chief financial\nofficer of Resource Staffing, Inc., a company through which Accel obtained some\nof its workers. The tax commissioner presented the testimony of an expert on\npackaging. Numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence, some subject to\nobjections to be resolved by the BTA in its decision.\n       {¶ 8} The BTA found that those items purchased by Accel that, through\n“assembly,” became part of the gift sets qualified for exemption. BTA No. 2012-\n2840, 2015 WL 4410600, *3-4 (July 15, 2015). It arrived at this conclusion in two\nsteps. First, the BTA stated that Accel was not engaged in “merely packaging\nproducts,” and it went on to find that “Accel’s activities do not involve packaging.”\nId. at *3. Second, the BTA determined that Accel’s preparation of the gift sets did\nconstitute “assembly.” Id. at *4.\n       {¶ 9} Next, the BTA found that the evidence showed that the employees\nsupplied to Accel by Resource Staffing were assigned “on a permanent basis,” with\nthe result that Accel did not owe sales or use tax on the purchase of employment\nservices from Resource Staffing. Id. at *5. In contrast, the BTA found that there\nwas insufficient evidence for it to find that employees supplied to Accel by\nManpower, Inc., were assigned on a permanent basis, so those transactions were\nfound to be taxable. Id. at *6.\n       {¶ 10} Finally, the BTA found that R.C. 5703.58(B) imposed no time bar\non any aspect of the assessment, because that provision did not take effect until\nafter the tax commissioner issued the assessment. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n                                    ANALYSIS\n                                Standard of Review\n          {¶ 11} In reviewing a decision of the BTA, we determine whether the\ndecision is “reasonable and lawful.” Satullo v. Wilkins, 111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-\nOhio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, ¶ 14.           Although the BTA is responsible for\ndetermining factual issues, this court “ ‘will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision\nthat is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.’ ” Id., quoting Gahanna-Jefferson\nLocal School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino, 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789\n(2001).\n          The BTA Reviews Tax-Commissioner Determinations De Novo\n          {¶ 12} Under his second proposition of law, the tax commissioner argues\nthat the BTA erred because it “merely substituted its own fact finding for that of\nthe Tax Commissioner.” The tax commissioner relies on Hatchadorian v. Lindley,\n21 Ohio St.3d 66, 488 N.E.2d 145 (1986), paragraph one of the syllabus, which\narticulates a “clearly unreasonable or unlawful” standard for rebutting the tax\ncommissioner’s findings. We have mentioned that standard in subsequent cases.\nE.g., Am. Fiber Sys., Inc. v. Levin, 125 Ohio St.3d 374, 2010-Ohio-1468, 928\nN.E.2d 695, ¶ 42; Newman v. Levin, 120 Ohio St.3d 127, 2008-Ohio-5202, 896\nN.E.2d 995, ¶ 31; Nusseibeh v. Zaino, 98 Ohio St.3d 292, 2003-Ohio-855, 784\nN.E.2d 93, ¶ 10. Although the “clearly unreasonable and unlawful” standard does\nimply that the BTA should accord deference to the tax commissioner’s findings of\nfact, two strands of case law establish that deference is not required.\n          {¶ 13} First, longstanding case law unequivocally holds that the BTA’s\nstandard for reviewing the tax commissioner’s findings is de novo, as to both facts\nand law. Key Servs. Corp. v. Zaino, 95 Ohio St.3d 11, 16, 764 N.E.2d 1015 (2002),\nciting Higbee Co. v. Evatt, 140 Ohio St. 325, 332, 43 N.E.2d 273 (1942); accord\nMacDonald v. Shaker Hts. Bd. of Income Tax Rev., 144 Ohio St.3d 105, 2015-Ohio-\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n3290, 41 N.E.3d 376, ¶ 21. De novo review is, of course, the opposite of deferential\nreview.\n          {¶ 14} Second, our case law establishes—without any reference to a\n“clearly unreasonable” standard—that the tax commissioner’s findings are\npresumed valid subject to rebuttal: “The rule is well settled that a taxpayer\nchallenging the assessment has the burden to ‘ “ ‘show in what manner and to what\nextent * * * the commissioner’s investigation and audit, and the findings and\nassessments based thereon, were faulty and incorrect.’ ” ’ ” Krehnbrink v. Testa,\n148 Ohio St.3d 129, 2016-Ohio-3391, 69 N.E.3d 656, ¶ 30, quoting Maxxim Med.,\nInc. v. Tracy, 87 Ohio St.3d 337, 339, 720 N.E.2d 911 (1999), quoting Federated\nDept. Stores, Inc. v. Lindley, 5 Ohio St.3d 213, 215, 450 N.E.2d 687 (1983), quoting\nMidwest Transfer Co. v. Porterfield, 13 Ohio St.2d 138, 141, 235 N.E.2d 511\n(1968).      Notably, under this standard, the burden for rebutting the tax\ncommissioner’s findings is simply to prove that the findings were incorrect.\n          {¶ 15} We recently invoked the Hatchadorian standard in the context of\nvacating a finding of the BTA that had contradicted the tax commissioner’s own\nfinding that a trust was a “nonresident trust” for purposes of R.C. 5747.01(I)(3).\nT. Ryan Legg Irrevocable Trust v. Testa, 149 Ohio St.3d 376, 2016-Ohio-8418, 75\nN.E.3d 184, ¶ 62-63. But close examination shows that our decision in that case\ndid not require the BTA to defer to the tax commissioner as a finder of fact. To the\ncontrary, we set forth two specific reasons for setting aside the BTA’s finding of\nthe trust’s residency. First, the BTA’s finding was defective because the BTA\nfailed to consider one essential statutory element of trust residency. Id. at ¶ 58.\nSecond, the tax commissioner’s finding that the trust was a nonresident trust had\nnot been contested at the BTA and no probative evidence had been presented to\nshow that the tax commissioner’s original determination was factually incorrect.\nId. at ¶ 62. These considerations did not cause us to reverse the BTA’s residency\nfinding; instead, we vacated the BTA’s finding on the grounds that the presumptive\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nvalidity of the tax commissioner’s finding had not been rebutted because it had not\nbeen contested, with an offer of proof, at the BTA. Id. at ¶ 63. Thus, as relevant\nhere, T. Ryan Legg Irrevocable Trust stands for nothing more than the proposition\nthat the BTA must affirm a finding of the tax commissioner when the finding has\nnot been shown to be incorrect.\n       {¶ 16} For the foregoing reasons, we reject the tax commissioner’s second\nproposition of law.     We hold that the BTA owed no deference to the tax\ncommissioner’s findings beyond placing the evidentiary burden on the taxpayer,\nAccel, to show them to be, by a preponderance of the evidence, incorrect. And in\nreviewing the BTA’s own factual findings, “[w]e must affirm * * * if they are\nsupported by reliable and probative evidence, and we afford deference to the BTA’s\ndetermination of the credibility of witnesses and its weighing of the evidence\nsubject only to an abuse-of-discretion review on appeal.” HealthSouth Corp. v.\nTesta, 132 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, ¶ 10.\n   Accel’s Preparation of Gift Sets Could Reasonably Be Found to Involve\n                          “Assembling” or “Assembly”\n       {¶ 17} R.C. 5739.02(B)(42)(a) provides an exemption from taxation for\n“[s]ales where the purpose of the purchaser is to * * * incorporate the thing\ntransferred as a material or a part into tangible personal property to be produced for\nsale by manufacturing, assembling, processing, or refining * * *.” (Emphasis\nadded.) “Manufacturing” is not by itself defined, but “manufacturing operation” is\ndefined in R.C. 5739.01(S):\n\n\n               “Manufacturing operation” means a process in which\n       materials are changed, converted, or transformed into a different\n       state or form from which they previously existed and includes\n       refining materials, assembling parts, and preparing raw materials\n       and parts by mixing, measuring, blending, or otherwise committing\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n       such    materials   or   parts   to   the   manufacturing    process.\n       “Manufacturing operation” does not include packaging.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) R.C. 5739.01(R) defines “assembly” and “assembling” as\n“attaching or fitting together parts to form a product, but [assembly and assembling]\ndo not include packaging a product.”\n       {¶ 18} The BTA applied these interlocking definitions to find that Accel’s\ngift-set production involved “assembly” or “assembling” but not “manufacturing”\nper se. According to the BTA, Accel was attaching or fitting together components\nto create a new whole but it was not engaging in an operation producing the type\nof change of form that characterizes manufacturing per se. 2015 WL 44106005 at\n*4, citing Sauder Woodworking Co. v. Limbach, 38 Ohio St.3d 175, 177, 527\nN.E.2d 296 (1988). The BTA also specifically found that Accel’s activities did not\nconstitute “packaging.” Id. at *3.\n       {¶ 19} Under his third proposition of law, the tax commissioner contests the\nBTA’s finding that Accel was not engaged in “packaging”; under his fourth\nproposition of law, the tax commissioner challenges the finding that “assembling”\nwas involved. In its cross-appeal, Accel challenges the BTA’s finding that it was\nnot engaged in “manufacturing.” Although we agree with the tax commissioner\nthat the activity at issue did meet the definition of “packaging,” we reject his\ncontention that the activity did not constitute “assembling.” And because we hold\nthat the BTA reasonably and lawfully found that assembling was involved, we need\nnot consider whether Accel was engaged in manufacturing per se.\n       {¶ 20} At the outset, there was sufficient evidence to support the BTA’s\nfinding that “Accel does more than merely package products,” 2015 WL 4410600\nat *3, and that Accel engaged in “assembling.” Accel’s cost-accounting manager\ntestified that Accel produced its gift sets through a three-stage process—a design\nphase, a planning phase, and an assembly phase. In the design phase, Accel worked\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nwith its clients “to brainstorm ideas on how to build that gift set, how that gift set\nis going to be presented in an aesthetic form so that it is sellable in a retail\nenvironment.” The design phase also involved drawing up a written “specification”\ndocument setting forth instructions for building the gift set and stating the materials\nto be used. Those instructions were then incorporated into an internal document\nfor Accel’s use that set forth the production-line procedures it would employ. The\ninitial two phases involved determining the costs of the items to be included in the\ngift set and the cost of the labor to do the assembly. The design and planning\nprocess usually took between two and six months to complete before the assembly\nphase began. According to its cost-accounting manager, Accel was engaging in\napproximately 217 such projects per year at the time of the BTA hearing.\n       {¶ 21} The tax commissioner levels a four-pronged legal challenge to the\nBTA’s finding. First, the tax commissioner argues that a canon of statutory\nconstruction, noscitur a sociis, calls for construing “assembling” to involve a\nchange in state or form in the same way “manufacturing,” “processing,” and\n“refining” would. The Latin phrase means “it is known by its associates,” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 1224 (10th Ed.2014); the tax commissioner maintains that the\nscope accorded to “assembling” must be limited by the other terms included in R.C.\n5739.02(B)(42)(a).\n       {¶ 22} We disagree.       The fact that the legislature chose to define\n“assembling” in R.C. 5739.01(R) in accordance with its ordinary meaning indicates\nthe intent that “assembling” adds an element to the listing in R.C.\n5739.02(B)(42)(a) that is otherwise absent. Under this reading, “assembling”\nextends the exemption to situations in which there is no transformation of\nsubstances but there is a putting together of components into a new functional (or\nin this case aesthetic) whole. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n131 (2002) (defining “assemble” in part as “to fit together various parts of so as to\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nmake into an operative whole”). This is clear enough that we need not resort to the\nstatutory canon noscitur a sociis.\n       {¶ 23} Second, the tax commissioner argues that because the definition of\n“assembling” in R.C. 5739.01(R) excludes “packaging,” any activity that qualifies\nas “packaging” cannot constitute “assembling.”         Thus, according to the tax\ncommissioner, even if an activity independently qualifies as manufacturing,\nassembling, processing, or refining, it does not trigger the exemption if it also\nconstitutes “packaging.”\n       {¶ 24} To consider this argument, it is necessary to consult the statutory\ndefinition of “packaging”; R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) defines “packages” and\n“packaging” in connection with the packaging exemption as follows:\n\n\n       “Packages” includes bags, baskets, cartons, crates, boxes, cans,\n       bottles, bindings, wrappings, and other similar devices and\n       containers, but does not include motor vehicles or bulk tanks,\n       trailers, or similar devices attached to motor vehicles. “Packaging”\n       means placing in a package.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n       {¶ 25} The preparation of gift sets clearly involves “placing in a package”\nbecause the various items Accel included in the gift sets—manufactured soaps,\nlotions, and other accessory and toiletry items—were boxed, wrapped, and bound\ntogether in being made part of a gift set. Moreover, the activity satisfies the case-\nlaw consideration that “packaging” involves “restrain[ing] movement” of the items\nin the gift set “in more than one plane of direction.” Custom Beverage Packers,\nInc. v. Kosydar, 33 Ohio St.2d 68, 73, 294 N.E.2d 672 (1973). We accordingly\ndisagree with the BTA’s conclusion that Accel’s activities did not constitute\n“packaging.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 26} Although Accel’s operations did involve packaging, that fact alone\ndoes not disqualify its production of gift sets from constituting “assembling.” The\nissue here is how to treat an activity that is covered by both the assembling\ndefinition and the packaging definition, and the case law cuts against the tax\ncommissioner’s position in this regard. In Cole Natl. Corp. v. Collins, 46 Ohio\nSt.2d 336, 339, 348 N.E.2d 708 (1976), this court effectively held that “packaging”\ncan be an incidental function, meaning that even when the packaging definition\napplies, that is not determinative of the taxable status of the transactions.\n       {¶ 27} In Cole Natl., a manufacturer sought to obtain the packaging\nexemption for display cases and racks that contained manufactured merchandise;\nthe manufacturer shipped the initial order of merchandise to a retailer in the display\ncases or on display racks. Thus, the display cases and racks served as packages,\nbut they were also designed to be used by retailers to store and display the\nmerchandise for sale to customers. Id. at 336-337. This court affirmed the denial\nof the packaging exemption for the display cases and racks, holding that the\nfunction of the display cases and racks as packaging was “incidental to their use as\na marketing aid.” Id. at 339. By the same logic, the fact that the gift sets here\nfunctioned as “packaging” for the included items is incidental to the fact that in\nassembled form, they constituted a new and differently marketable product.\n       {¶ 28} Third, the tax commissioner contends that Accel’s own use of the\nwords “package” and “packaging” in describing its business to the public cuts\nagainst its exemption claim. And the record contains promotional materials and\nnews articles in which Accel’s executives and others refer to the company’s\nparticipation in the “contract packaging industry,” call the company a “contract\npackager,” and refer to its production as involving “packaging.” This is, of course,\nsignificant because the definitions of “assembling,” R.C. 5739.01(R), and\n“manufacturing operation,” R.C. 5739.01(S), both specifically exclude the mere\n“packaging” of a product. But the BTA’s rejection of this argument was not\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nunreasonable—Accel’s promoting itself as a “packager” for business purposes did\nnot necessarily preclude the conclusion that its operations involved “assembling”\nas that word is specially defined for purposes of tax exemption.\n         {¶ 29} Fourth, the tax commissioner contends that case law of this court\nprecludes the BTA’s finding that “assembling” occurred in this case.             This\nargument is unpersuasive because the cases the tax commissioner relies on did not\ninvolve a situation in which manufactured goods were (at least arguably) being\n“assembled” into a new, separately marketable whole. For example, Fichtel &\nSachs Industries, Inc. v. Wilkins, 108 Ohio St.3d 106, 2006-Ohio-246, 841 N.E.2d\n294, was a personal-property-tax-exemption case involving the issue whether\nputting clutch components into packages for shipment constituted “processing,”\nthereby defeating a claimed exemption for inventory held “for storage only” under\nR.C. 5701.08 and 5711.22. We did state that “[p]ackaging is not processing,” id.\nat ¶ 40, but the issue in Fichtel & Sachs is not apposite to the one presented in this\nappeal, which involves “assembling” manufactured items into a new aesthetic\nwhole.\n         {¶ 30} In Sauder Woodworking, 38 Ohio St.3d at 176, 527 N.E.2d 296, a\nmanufacturer of “knock down” furniture—furniture that was sold in an\nunassembled state to consumers—sought a sales-and-use-tax exemption for boxes\nin which furniture components were shipped. Sauder Woodworking argued that\nthe packaging material was exempt because it was used directly in manufacturing\nor processing its products; we agreed with the tax commissioner and the BTA in\nrejecting this contention, based on the principle that “the container is [not] an\ninherent part of the product, as the furniture was equally functional and usable prior\nto its packaging.” Id. at 177. By contrast, the gift sets in this case do constitute a\nnew product of which the packaging materials are a component.\n         {¶ 31} In Scholz Homes, Inc. v. Porterfield, 25 Ohio St.2d 67, 266 N.E.2d\n834 (1971), forklifts were used to move component parts that were later to be\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nassembled into homes from a plant’s “fabricating” area to an “expediting” area,\nwhere the items were packed for shipment. Id. at 68-69. Rejecting a claim that the\nforklifts were used as part of a process that involved “assembling,” we held that\n“assembling” means “more than the mere gathering together of fabricated\nmaterials”; “assembling” means fitting together various parts to make a new\noperative whole. Id. at 72. Quite simply, the BTA was justified in finding that the\nactivity at issue in this case constituted “assembling,” as the word is described in\nScholz Homes.\n       {¶ 32} For the foregoing reasons, we reject the tax commissioner’s first\nthrough fourth propositions of law relating to the BTA’s finding that Accel was\nengaged in “assembling.” At oral argument, counsel for the tax commissioner\nadvanced an alternative contention that “some of this stuff is not even [the\nproduction of] a gift set; it’s ‘I’m putting it in a box to send it off.’ ” But neither\nthe notice of appeal nor the tax commissioner’s main brief argues that the case\nshould be remanded with an instruction that transactions that involved\n“assembling” of gift sets should be segregated from those transactions that did not.\nUnder these circumstances, the tax commissioner has abandoned the argument. See\nNavistar, Inc. v. Testa, 143 Ohio St.3d 460, 2015-Ohio-3283, 39 N.E.3d 509, ¶ 39,\nciting E. Liverpool v. Columbiana Cty. Budget Comm., 116 Ohio St.3d 1201, 2007-\nOhio-5505, 876 N.E.2d 575, ¶ 3.\n  Accel’s Transactions with Resource Staffing Could Reasonably Be Found\n                        Exempt under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3)\n       {¶ 33} “Employment service” is subjected to sales and use tax pursuant to\nR.C. 5739.02 and 5739.01(B)(3)(k). Pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(JJ):\n\n\n                “Employment service” means providing or supplying\n       personnel, on a temporary or long-term basis, to perform work or\n       labor under the supervision or control of another, when the\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                 January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n        personnel so provided or supplied receive their wages, salary, or\n        other compensation from the provider or supplier of the employment\n        service or from a third party that provided or supplied the personnel\n        to the provider or supplier. “Employment service” does not include:\n                  ***\n                  (3)   Supplying personnel to a purchaser pursuant to a\n        contract of at least one year between the service provider and the\n        purchaser that specifies that each employee covered under the\n        contract is assigned to the purchaser on a permanent basis.\n\n\n        {¶ 34} The BTA found that Accel’s dealings with Resource Staffing\nqualified under the permanent-assignment exemption of R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3), while\nAccel’s dealings with Manpower did not. Under his fifth proposition of law, the\ntax commissioner contests the first finding; on cross-appeal, Accel contests the\nlatter finding.\n   The BTA made no formal finding concerning the “supervision or control” of\n                        personnel supplied by Resource Staffing\n        {¶ 35} After determining that Accel’s arrangements with Resource Staffing\ntriggered the permanent-assignment exemption, the BTA stated:\n\n\n                  Moreover, Accel argues that the employees provided by\n        Resource Staffing were not “under the supervision or control of\n        another,” as is required to meet the definition of “employment\n        service” in R.C. 5739.01(JJ). The testimony of [Moises Lluberes]\n        indicated that Resource Staffing supplied supervisors, on its own\n        payroll, not Accel’s, to supervise and direct the employees provided\n        for Accel’s production activities.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n2015 WL 4410600 at *6. The BTA’s decision then starts a new paragraph\naddressing a totally different subject: whether Accel’s arrangement with Manpower\ntriggered the permanent-assignment exemption.\n       {¶ 36} In his notice of appeal and his brief, the tax commissioner treats the\nstatement quoted above as if it were a finding and then argues that the BTA erred\nin making that finding. The tax commissioner points out that the contract between\nResource Staffing and Accel itself recited that the employees would be under\nAccel’s supervision and control. In its brief, Accel also treats the BTA’s statement\nas if it were a finding that the personnel did not act under Accel’s own supervision\nand control.\n       {¶ 37} We conclude that the quoted passage from the BTA’s decision does\nnot constitute a formal finding.    The passage recites an additional argument\nadvanced by Accel and alludes to its evidentiary significance, but it does not\nexplicitly draw any conclusion as to the argument’s validity. And making such a\nfinding was unnecessary, because the BTA had already found that the permanent-\nassignment exemption applied to Accel’s dealings with Resource Staffing.\nBecause there was no formal finding regarding the supervision of the employees,\nwe decline to address this contention.\nThe tax commissioner raises legal arguments that have been rejected by the case\n                                         law\n       {¶ 38} On its face, the permanent-assignment exemption of R.C.\n5739.01(JJ)(3) appears to turn on the content of the employment-services contract\nunderlying the transaction.     And consistent with that plain reading, the tax\ncommissioner’s fifth proposition of law asserts that the BTA erred by finding that\nthe permanent-assignment exemption applied regarding employees supplied to\nAccel by Resource Staffing: “When an employment services contract fails to\nprovide an express term for ‘permanent’ employees, the [BTA] cannot supply the\nmissing terms by inquiring into facts and circumstances of the employment\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nrelationship.” The tax commissioner then focuses his argument on the content of\nthe written employment-services agreement between Accel and Resource Staffing.\n       {¶ 39} But the tax commissioner is reviving an argument that this court has\nrejected in previous cases. This court has twice declined to adopt an analysis that\nnarrowly focuses on whether an employment-services contract “specifies”\npermanent assignment and has instead applied a broader facts-and-circumstances\ntest. First, in H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino, 100 Ohio St.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, 800\nN.E.2d 740, the tax commissioner had argued to the BTA that H.R. Options’s\ncontracts with its clients contained “no contractual provision that ‘specifies\npermanent’ assignment” and that its “practice of continuous employment cannot be\noffered as evidence when no written contract provision exists.” See BTA No. 2001-\nM-808, 2002 WL 1813907, *3 (Aug. 2, 2002). Neither the BTA nor this court\naccepted the tax commissioner’s contract-centered approach. Indeed, this court’s\nanalysis placed greater emphasis on the individual employment contracts between\nthe employees and the employment-services provider that were in the record than\non the overarching employment-services contracts between the provider and its\nclients. H.R. Options at ¶ 23-25.\n       {¶ 40} In H.R. Options, we articulated a test that does not emphasize the\nwording of the employment-services contract, as advocated by the tax\ncommissioner here. Instead, the test for permanent assignment has two elements:\n(1) the employee must be assigned for an indefinite period, i.e., the contract stating\nthe employee’s assignment does not specify an ending date, and (2) the employee\nmust not be provided as a substitute for a current employee who is on leave or to\nmeet seasonal or short-term-workload needs. Id. at ¶ 21. In applying the test, “both\nthe contract and the facts and circumstances of the employee’s assignment are\nfactors that must be reviewed to determine whether the employee is being assigned\non a permanent basis.” Id. Most significantly, we then approved the exemption\nfrom taxation for some of the employees based on the facts and circumstances when\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe employment-services contract between the provider and the client plainly did\nnot specify that they were assigned on a permanent basis. Id. at ¶ 23-24. And we\nremanded transactions involving certain other employees to the BTA for further\nreview to determine whether they were purely seasonal, i.e., nonexempt,\nassignments. Id. at ¶ 26.\n       {¶ 41} In Bay Mechanical & Elec. Corp. v. Testa, 133 Ohio St.3d 423,\n2012-Ohio-4312, 978 N.E.2d 882, ¶ 19, we explained that in H.R. Options, we had\n“construed the exemption as turning on the facts of each employee’s assignment\nrather than on the presence of ‘magic words’ in the employment-service agreements\nthemselves.” We then took the additional step of holding that the presence of the\n“magic words” in the employment-services contracts could not, in light of H.R.\nOptions, be dispositive in favor of exemption. Bay Mechanical at ¶ 22.\n       {¶ 42} The tax commissioner tries to bolster his emphasis on R.C.\n5739.01(JJ)(3)’s “specifies” language with a contract-law argument. The tax\ncommissioner contends that an approach that determines the exemption’s\napplicability based on facts-and-circumstances evidence violates principles of\ncontract law by allowing course of performance to supply a contract term that is\nnot present in the actual contract. The tax commissioner maintains that because\nunder contract law, a contract term that is not set forth in the contract itself is\n“deemed to have no existence,” Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co.,\n46 Ohio St.3d 51, 53, 544 N.E.2d 920 (1989), and therefore cannot be shown by\nextrinsic evidence, R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) cannot properly be construed to support\napplication of a facts-and-circumstances test to establish that the employees here\nwere “assigned * * * on a permanent basis” when the employment-services contract\nfailed to specify permanent assignment.\n       {¶ 43} This argument also is at odds with the case law. It cannot be\nreconciled with the facts-and-circumstances test set forth in H.R. Options and\nexplained by Bay Mechanical. Indeed, the tax commissioner’s argument had been\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f                                 January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nrejected by the BTA at the time H.R. Options was decided, and those earlier\ndecisions formed the basis for the approach taken in H.R. Options. See Bay\nMechanical at ¶ 23 (“H.R. Options adopts a consistent theme sounded by the BTA\nitself when reviewing exemption claims: when ‘determining whether an exception\nor exemption to taxation applies, it is not just the form of a contract that is\nimportant,’ but instead, the ‘crucial inquiry becomes a determination of what the\nseller is providing and of what the purchaser is paying for in their agreement’ ”),\nquoting Excel Temporaries, Inc. v. Tracy, BTA No. 97-T-257, 1998 WL 775284,\n*2 (Oct. 30, 1998).\n         {¶ 44} For the foregoing reasons, the tax commissioner’s objections based\non his proposed interpretation of R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) to the BTA’s finding\nregarding permanent assignment of the Resource Staffing employees are without\nmerit.\nThe BTA’s finding of permanent assignment is neither unreasonable nor unlawful\n         {¶ 45} In his brief, the tax commissioner then turns away from his contract-\ncentered argument based on R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3)’s wording and delves into the facts\nand circumstances of this case. Most importantly, he points to substantial evidence\nin the record that the employee assignments at issue here may have been seasonal\nor designed to meet “short-term workload conditions,” H.R. Options, 100 Ohio\nSt.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, 800 N.E.2d 740, at ¶ 21. Under H.R. Options, neither of\nthose types of assignment transactions qualifies for the permanent-assignment\nexemption.      The tax commissioner in his final determination had found\n“compelling” evidence that Accel’s “labor force fluctuates with the seasons,”\nnoting the nature of its business and the fact that invoices from Manpower and\nResource Staffing demonstrated fluctuating payroll dollar amounts with heaviest\nspending on employee labor from August through December, and therefore had\ndetermined that the employees were “seasonal in nature.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f                                  SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {¶ 46} In arriving at a contrary conclusion regarding employees supplied by\nResource Staffing, the BTA relied primarily on the testimony of Accel’s chief\nfinancial officer, Daniel Harms, and Moises Lluberes, the chief financial officer of\nResource Staffing. The gist of their testimony was that Accel sought to have\nemployees return for job after job once they had been trained and that during\nperiods when less work was available, Resource Staffing would reduce the hours\nthe employees worked rather than discharging them. Lluberes specifically testified\nthat Resource Staffing supplied 647 persons to Accel as employees from 2006\nthrough 2011 (when its contract with Accel ended) and that about 358 of those\nemployees worked more than one year at Accel.1 Lluberes also testified that\nResource Staffing would not reassign personnel placed with Accel to other clients\nwhen the workload at Accel decreased. The BTA relied on this testimony to\nconclude that the personnel supplied by Resource Staffing were “assigned on a\npermanent basis.” 2015 WL 4410600 at *5.\n         {¶ 47} Although there is no question that the number of Resource Staffing\nworkers at Accel fluctuated significantly throughout the year and was greatest\nduring the fall as the holidays approached, the BTA concluded that the retention of\nthe same personnel through high-activity and low-activity periods negated their\nstatus as seasonal employees. This is best viewed as an aspect of the BTA’s factual\ndetermination that merits our deference.\n         {¶ 48} Ultimately, the distinction between seasonal or short-term-workload\nemployment and more regular employment is one of degree, not of kind. In every\nenterprise, the workload may experience periods of ebb and flow. It seems entirely\n\n1\n  Lluberes testified in part based on an exhibit that the BTA in its decision ultimately struck from\nthe record. The exhibit was a document stating the names and tenures of employees supplied by\nResource Staffing to Accel and was prepared at Lluberes’s direction by Resource Staffing’s\naccounting department. But even if he had not stated precise numbers, Lluberes’s testimony\nexplained the nature of the permanent-assignment relationship, as to which he was not cross-\nexamined. And the tax commissioner did not move to strike Lluberes’s general testimony regarding\nthe employees’ tenures, which appeared to rely on a foundation beyond that of the excluded exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nreasonable, therefore, that what matters in an ebb-and-flow business for purposes\nof R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) and our precedents is the continuity of the workforce, i.e.,\nare the same workers having their hours adjusted or are new workers being brought\nin to handle the extra work during the busy season only? Based on Lluberes’s\ntestimony, the BTA found the former to be true. Under H.R. Options, bringing back\nthe same workers each time with differing hours is consistent with permanent\nassignment; using new workers just for a brief workload spike is not.\n       {¶ 49} The tax commissioner argues that Lluberes’s testimony was so\nbiased that the BTA could not have reasonably relied on it. But as discussed, we\nreview the BTA’s weighing of evidence and determinations of witness credibility\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard, meaning that we will reverse a decision of\nthe BTA only if we detect an arbitrary or unconscionable attitude. HealthSouth\nCorp., 132 Ohio St.3d 55, 2012-Ohio-1871, 969 N.E.2d 232, at ¶ 10; NWD 300\nSpring, L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, ___ Ohio St.3d ___, 2017-Ohio-\n7579, ___ N.E.3d ___, ¶ 14. Although Lluberes undeniably had a business interest\nin relation to his testimony, the BTA did not abuse its discretion by crediting that\ntestimony in spite of any possible bias.\n The BTA Reasonably Concluded that Accel Did Not Show that Manpower\n                     Personnel Were Permanently Assigned\n       {¶ 50} On cross-appeal, Accel argues that the BTA erred by regarding the\nevidence as insufficient to establish that the personnel supplied by Manpower were\nalso permanent-assignment employees. See 2015 WL 4410600 at *6. Accel\nchallenges that finding by pointing to the affidavit of its president, David Abraham.\n       {¶ 51} Abraham’s affidavit summarily recited that no written agreement\nexisted with Manpower but that the parties contemplated “a long term relationship\nof at least one year” and that Accel requested that the employees be assigned\nindefinitely because they would have been trained and exposed to confidential\nmanufacturing processes. The affidavit also detailed some types of work performed\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nby the employees. Notably, the affidavit did not even address the question of\nseasonal labor.\n       {¶ 52} We reject Accel’s contention that the BTA erred by failing to grant\nexemption based on the affidavit. Accel bore the burden of proof to show that it\nwas entitled to a tax exemption, but it adduced a much smaller quantum of proof\nwith respect to the Manpower transactions than it did regarding the transactions\ninvolving Resource Staffing, failing to even address central concerns regarding the\napplicability of the exemption for the transactions involving Manpower. Under\nthese circumstances, Accel has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\nR.C. 5703.58(B) Is Inapplicable Because It Became Law after the Issuance of\n                             the Assessment at Issue\n       {¶ 53} R.C. 5703.58(B) prohibits the tax commissioner from “mak[ing] or\nissu[ing] an assessment against a consumer for any tax due under Chapter 5741 of\nthe Revised Code, or for any penalty, interest, or additional charge on such tax, if\nthe tax was due before January 1, 2008.” Accel argues on cross-appeal that this\nprovision applies to this case. If the provision is applicable, it would bar a\nconsiderable portion of the tax commissioner’s assessment.\n       {¶ 54} But the provision was enacted as part of 2011 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 153,\nand it became effective on September 29, 2011. The tax commissioner issued his\nassessment on January 18, 2011. Because the provision was not in effect when the\ntax commissioner issued his assessment, it did not bar the issuance of that\nassessment. We therefore affirm the BTA’s ruling on this point.\nThe BTA Did Not Abuse Its Discretion Regarding the Expert Testimony and\n                                Experts’ Reports\n       {¶ 55} On various grounds, each party contests the other party’s expert\ntestimony and expert’s written report offered into evidence at the BTA hearing.\nOur starting point for evaluating the arguments is that we accord the BTA wide\ndiscretion in evaluating proffered expert testimony.

It\nfollows that the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard is applicable to the\narguments advanced regarding the experts.\n       {¶ 56} The need for considering those arguments, however, is obviated by\nthe fact that the BTA’s decision sets forth extensive analysis in support of its\nconclusions without relying on evidence offered by either expert.

On\nappeal, the Board of Tax Appeals (“BTA”) affirmed the assessment in part and\nreversed the assessment in part.\n       {¶ 2} The BTA reversed the imposition of use tax on materials Accel\nacquired to be used and incorporated into gift sets, holding that the purchases were\nentitled to exemption under R.C. 5739.02(B)(42)(a) and 5739.01(R) because the\npreparation of the gift sets involved “assembling” or “assembly.” The BTA also\nreversed the imposition of use tax on certain transactions by which Accel obtained\n“employment services” through one of its suppliers, holding that the transactions\nwere exempt under R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3), which exempts transactions involving the\nassignment of employees “on a permanent basis.” The tax commissioner appeals\nthese findings and asserts in conjunction with his appeal that the BTA should have\ndeferred to his own factual findings.\n       {¶ 3} In its cross-appeal, Accel contests the BTA’s ruling that no portion of\nthe assessment is time-barred by R.C. 5703.58(B). Accel also contends that the\nproduction of gift sets qualifies for exemption directly under the definition of\n“manufacturing operation” in R.C. 5739.01(S) and that the employment-services\ntransactions with a different supplier should also have been exempted.\n       {¶ 4} Finally, each party contests the BTA’s decision to admit into evidence\nthe report and testimony of the opposing party’s expert witness.\n       {¶ 5} Based on our review of the issues presented, the record before us, the\nbriefs, and the relevant case law, we conclude that the BTA acted reasonably and\nlawfully with respect to all of the contested findings. We therefore affirm the\ndecision of the BTA.\n                         COURSE OF PROCEEDINGS\n       {¶ 6} The tax commissioner issued a use-tax assessment against Accel on\nJanuary 18, 2011. Accel petitioned for reassessment, and the tax commissioner\nissued his final determination on June 26, 2012, stating the amount of unpaid use\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f                                  January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\ntax as $2,447,159.84, plus preassessment interest of $651,862.91 and a penalty of\n$122,357.99, for a total assessment of $3,221,380.74. Accel appealed to the BTA.\n       {¶ 7} The BTA held a hearing at which Accel presented the testimony of its\npresident, its cost-accounting manager, an expert on manufacturing, the tax\ndepartment’s audit agent, Accel’s chief financial officer, and the chief financial\nofficer of Resource Staffing, Inc., a company through which Accel obtained some\nof its workers. The tax commissioner presented the testimony of an expert on\npackaging. Numerous exhibits were introduced into evidence, some subject to\nobjections to be resolved by the BTA in its decision.\n       {¶ 8} The BTA found that those items purchased by Accel that, through\n“assembly,” became part of the gift sets qualified for exemption. BTA No. 2012-\n2840, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3-4 (July 15, 2015). It arrived at this conclusion in two\nsteps. First, the BTA stated that Accel was not engaged in “merely packaging\nproducts,” and it went on to find that “Accel’s activities do not involve packaging.”\nId. at *3. Second, the BTA determined that Accel’s preparation of the gift sets did\nconstitute “assembly.” Id. at *4.\n       {¶ 9} Next, the BTA found that the evidence showed that the employees\nsupplied to Accel by Resource Staffing were assigned “on a permanent basis,” with\nthe result that Accel did not owe sales or use tax on the purchase of employment\nservices from Resource Staffing. Id. at *5. In contrast, the BTA found that there\nwas insufficient evidence for it to find that employees supplied to Accel by\nManpower, Inc., were assigned on a permanent basis, so those transactions were\nfound to be taxable. Id. at *6.\n       {¶ 10} Finally, the BTA found that R.C. 5703.58(B) imposed no time bar\non any aspect of the assessment, because that provision did not take effect until\nafter the tax commissioner issued the assessment.

Notably, under this standard, the burden for rebutting the tax\ncommissioner’s findings is simply to prove that the findings were incorrect.\n          {¶ 15} We recently invoked the Hatchadorian standard in the context of\nvacating a finding of the BTA that had contradicted the tax commissioner’s own\nfinding that a trust was a “nonresident trust” for purposes of R.C. 5747.01(I)(3).\nT.

But close examination shows that our decision in that case\ndid not require the BTA to defer to the tax commissioner as a finder of fact. To the\ncontrary, we set forth two specific reasons for setting aside the BTA’s finding of\nthe trust’s residency. First, the BTA’s finding was defective because the BTA\nfailed to consider one essential statutory element of trust residency. Id. at ¶ 58.\nSecond, the tax commissioner’s finding that the trust was a nonresident trust had\nnot been contested at the BTA and no probative evidence had been presented to\nshow that the tax commissioner’s original determination was factually incorrect.\nId. at ¶ 62. These considerations did not cause us to reverse the BTA’s residency\nfinding; instead, we vacated the BTA’s finding on the grounds that the presumptive\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nvalidity of the tax commissioner’s finding had not been rebutted because it had not\nbeen contested, with an offer of proof, at the BTA. Id. at ¶ 63. Thus, as relevant\nhere, T. Ryan Legg Irrevocable Trust stands for nothing more than the proposition\nthat the BTA must affirm a finding of the tax commissioner when the finding has\nnot been shown to be incorrect.\n       {¶ 16} For the foregoing reasons, we reject the tax commissioner’s second\nproposition of law.     We hold that the BTA owed no deference to the tax\ncommissioner’s findings beyond placing the evidentiary burden on the taxpayer,\nAccel, to show them to be, by a preponderance of the evidence, incorrect. And in\nreviewing the BTA’s own factual findings, “[w]e must affirm * * * if they are\nsupported by reliable and probative evidence, and we afford deference to the BTA’s\ndetermination of the credibility of witnesses and its weighing of the evidence\nsubject only to an abuse-of-discretion review on appeal.” HealthSouth Corp. v.\nTesta, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2012-Ohio-1871, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">232</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 10.\n   Accel’s Preparation of Gift Sets Could Reasonably Be Found to Involve\n                          “Assembling” or “Assembly”\n       {¶ 17} R.C. 5739.02(B)(42)(a) provides an exemption from taxation for\n“[s]ales where the purpose of the purchaser is to * * * incorporate the thing\ntransferred as a material or a part into tangible personal property to be produced for\nsale by manufacturing, assembling, processing, or refining * * *.” (Emphasis\nadded.) “Manufacturing” is not by itself defined, but “manufacturing operation” is\ndefined in R.C. 5739.01(S):\n\n\n               “Manufacturing operation” means a process in which\n       materials are changed, converted, or transformed into a different\n       state or form from which they previously existed and includes\n       refining materials, assembling parts, and preparing raw materials\n       and parts by mixing, measuring, blending, or otherwise committing\n\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n       such    materials   or   parts   to   the   manufacturing    process.\n       “Manufacturing operation” does not include packaging.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.) R.C. 5739.01(R) defines “assembly” and “assembling” as\n“attaching or fitting together parts to form a product, but [assembly and assembling]\ndo not include packaging a product.”\n       {¶ 18} The BTA applied these interlocking definitions to find that Accel’s\ngift-set production involved “assembly” or “assembling” but not “manufacturing”\nper se. According to the BTA, Accel was attaching or fitting together components\nto create a new whole but it was not engaging in an operation producing the type\nof change of form that characterizes manufacturing per se. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">5 at\n*4, citing Sauder Woodworking Co. v.

The BTA also specifically found that Accel’s activities did not\nconstitute “packaging.” Id. at *3.\n       {¶ 19} Under his third proposition of law, the tax commissioner contests the\nBTA’s finding that Accel was not engaged in “packaging”; under his fourth\nproposition of law, the tax commissioner challenges the finding that “assembling”\nwas involved. In its cross-appeal, Accel challenges the BTA’s finding that it was\nnot engaged in “manufacturing.” Although we agree with the tax commissioner\nthat the activity at issue did meet the definition of “packaging,” we reject his\ncontention that the activity did not constitute “assembling.” And because we hold\nthat the BTA reasonably and lawfully found that assembling was involved, we need\nnot consider whether Accel was engaged in manufacturing per se.\n       {¶ 20} At the outset, there was sufficient evidence to support the BTA’s\nfinding that “Accel does more than merely package products,” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nat *3, and that Accel engaged in “assembling.” Accel’s cost-accounting manager\ntestified that Accel produced its gift sets through a three-stage process—a design\nphase, a planning phase, and an assembly phase. In the design phase, Accel worked\n\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nwith its clients “to brainstorm ideas on how to build that gift set, how that gift set\nis going to be presented in an aesthetic form so that it is sellable in a retail\nenvironment.” The design phase also involved drawing up a written “specification”\ndocument setting forth instructions for building the gift set and stating the materials\nto be used. Those instructions were then incorporated into an internal document\nfor Accel’s use that set forth the production-line procedures it would employ. The\ninitial two phases involved determining the costs of the items to be included in the\ngift set and the cost of the labor to do the assembly. The design and planning\nprocess usually took between two and six months to complete before the assembly\nphase began. According to its cost-accounting manager, Accel was engaging in\napproximately 217 such projects per year at the time of the BTA hearing.\n       {¶ 21} The tax commissioner levels a four-pronged legal challenge to the\nBTA’s finding. First, the tax commissioner argues that a canon of statutory\nconstruction, noscitur a sociis, calls for construing “assembling” to involve a\nchange in state or form in the same way “manufacturing,” “processing,” and\n“refining” would. The Latin phrase means “it is known by its associates,” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 1224 (10th Ed.2014); the tax commissioner maintains that the\nscope accorded to “assembling” must be limited by the other terms included in R.C.\n5739.02(B)(42)(a).\n       {¶ 22} We disagree.       The fact that the legislature chose to define\n“assembling” in R.C. 5739.01(R) in accordance with its ordinary meaning indicates\nthe intent that “assembling” adds an element to the listing in R.C.\n5739.02(B)(42)(a) that is otherwise absent. Under this reading, “assembling”\nextends the exemption to situations in which there is no transformation of\nsubstances but there is a putting together of components into a new functional (or\nin this case aesthetic) whole. See Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n131 (2002) (defining “assemble” in part as “to fit together various parts of so as to\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nmake into an operative whole”). This is clear enough that we need not resort to the\nstatutory canon noscitur a sociis.\n       {¶ 23} Second, the tax commissioner argues that because the definition of\n“assembling” in R.C. 5739.01(R) excludes “packaging,” any activity that qualifies\nas “packaging” cannot constitute “assembling.”         Thus, according to the tax\ncommissioner, even if an activity independently qualifies as manufacturing,\nassembling, processing, or refining, it does not trigger the exemption if it also\nconstitutes “packaging.”\n       {¶ 24} To consider this argument, it is necessary to consult the statutory\ndefinition of “packaging”; R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) defines “packages” and\n“packaging” in connection with the packaging exemption as follows:\n\n\n       “Packages” includes bags, baskets, cartons, crates, boxes, cans,\n       bottles, bindings, wrappings, and other similar devices and\n       containers, but does not include motor vehicles or bulk tanks,\n       trailers, or similar devices attached to motor vehicles. “Packaging”\n       means placing in a package.\n\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n       {¶ 25} The preparation of gift sets clearly involves “placing in a package”\nbecause the various items Accel included in the gift sets—manufactured soaps,\nlotions, and other accessory and toiletry items—were boxed, wrapped, and bound\ntogether in being made part of a gift set. Moreover, the activity satisfies the case-\nlaw consideration that “packaging” involves “restrain[ing] movement” of the items\nin the gift set “in more than one plane of direction.” Custom Beverage Packers,\nInc. v. Kosydar, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). We accordingly\ndisagree with the BTA’s conclusion that Accel’s activities did not constitute\n“packaging.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n       {¶ 26} Although Accel’s operations did involve packaging, that fact alone\ndoes not disqualify its production of gift sets from constituting “assembling.” The\nissue here is how to treat an activity that is covered by both the assembling\ndefinition and the packaging definition, and the case law cuts against the tax\ncommissioner’s position in this regard. In Cole Natl. Corp. v. Collins, 46 Ohio\nSt.2d 336, 339, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), this court effectively held that “packaging”\ncan be an incidental function, meaning that even when the packaging definition\napplies, that is not determinative of the taxable status of the transactions.\n       {¶ 27} In Cole Natl., a manufacturer sought to obtain the packaging\nexemption for display cases and racks that contained manufactured merchandise;\nthe manufacturer shipped the initial order of merchandise to a retailer in the display\ncases or on display racks. Thus, the display cases and racks served as packages,\nbut they were also designed to be used by retailers to store and display the\nmerchandise for sale to customers. Id. at 336-337. This court affirmed the denial\nof the packaging exemption for the display cases and racks, holding that the\nfunction of the display cases and racks as packaging was “incidental to their use as\na marketing aid.” Id. at 339. By the same logic, the fact that the gift sets here\nfunctioned as “packaging” for the included items is incidental to the fact that in\nassembled form, they constituted a new and differently marketable product.\n       {¶ 28} Third, the tax commissioner contends that Accel’s own use of the\nwords “package” and “packaging” in describing its business to the public cuts\nagainst its exemption claim. And the record contains promotional materials and\nnews articles in which Accel’s executives and others refer to the company’s\nparticipation in the “contract packaging industry,” call the company a “contract\npackager,” and refer to its production as involving “packaging.” This is, of course,\nsignificant because the definitions of “assembling,” R.C. 5739.01(R), and\n“manufacturing operation,” R.C. 5739.01(S), both specifically exclude the mere\n“packaging” of a product. But the BTA’s rejection of this argument was not\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nunreasonable—Accel’s promoting itself as a “packager” for business purposes did\nnot necessarily preclude the conclusion that its operations involved “assembling”\nas that word is specially defined for purposes of tax exemption.\n         {¶ 29} Fourth, the tax commissioner contends that case law of this court\nprecludes the BTA’s finding that “assembling” occurred in this case.             This\nargument is unpersuasive because the cases the tax commissioner relies on did not\ninvolve a situation in which manufactured goods were (at least arguably) being\n“assembled” into a new, separately marketable whole. For example, Fichtel &\nSachs Industries, Inc. v. Wilkins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2006-Ohio-246, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">294</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, was a personal-property-tax-exemption case involving the issue whether\nputting clutch components into packages for shipment constituted “processing,”\nthereby defeating a claimed exemption for inventory held “for storage only” under\nR.C. 5701.08 and 5711.22. We did state that “[p]ackaging is not processing,” id.\nat ¶ 40, but the issue in Fichtel & Sachs is not apposite to the one presented in this\nappeal, which involves “assembling” manufactured items into a new aesthetic\nwhole.\n         {¶ 30} In Sauder Woodworking, 38 Ohio St.3d at 176, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a\nmanufacturer of “knock down” furniture—furniture that was sold in an\nunassembled state to consumers—sought a sales-and-use-tax exemption for boxes\nin which furniture components were shipped. Sauder Woodworking argued that\nthe packaging material was exempt because it was used directly in manufacturing\nor processing its products; we agreed with the tax commissioner and the BTA in\nrejecting this contention, based on the principle that “the container is [not] an\ninherent part of the product, as the furniture was equally functional and usable prior\nto its packaging.” Id. at 177. By contrast, the gift sets in this case do constitute a\nnew product of which the packaging materials are a component.\n         {¶ 31} In Scholz Homes, Inc. v. Porterfield, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">834</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), forklifts were used to move component parts that were later to be\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f                             SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nassembled into homes from a plant’s “fabricating” area to an “expediting” area,\nwhere the items were packed for shipment. Id. at 68-69. Rejecting a claim that the\nforklifts were used as part of a process that involved “assembling,” we held that\n“assembling” means “more than the mere gathering together of fabricated\nmaterials”; “assembling” means fitting together various parts to make a new\noperative whole. Id. at 72. Quite simply, the BTA was justified in finding that the\nactivity at issue in this case constituted “assembling,” as the word is described in\nScholz Homes.\n       {¶ 32} For the foregoing reasons, we reject the tax commissioner’s first\nthrough fourth propositions of law relating to the BTA’s finding that Accel was\nengaged in “assembling.” At oral argument, counsel for the tax commissioner\nadvanced an alternative contention that “some of this stuff is not even [the\nproduction of] a gift set; it’s ‘I’m putting it in a box to send it off.’ ” But neither\nthe notice of appeal nor the tax commissioner’s main brief argues that the case\nshould be remanded with an instruction that transactions that involved\n“assembling” of gift sets should be segregated from those transactions that did not.\nUnder these circumstances, the tax commissioner has abandoned the argument.

Pursuant to R.C. 5739.01(JJ):\n\n\n                “Employment service” means providing or supplying\n       personnel, on a temporary or long-term basis, to perform work or\n       labor under the supervision or control of another, when the\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f                                 January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\n        personnel so provided or supplied receive their wages, salary, or\n        other compensation from the provider or supplier of the employment\n        service or from a third party that provided or supplied the personnel\n        to the provider or supplier. “Employment service” does not include:\n                  ***\n                  (3)   Supplying personnel to a purchaser pursuant to a\n        contract of at least one year between the service provider and the\n        purchaser that specifies that each employee covered under the\n        contract is assigned to the purchaser on a permanent basis.\n\n\n        {¶ 34} The BTA found that Accel’s dealings with Resource Staffing\nqualified under the permanent-assignment exemption of R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3), while\nAccel’s dealings with Manpower did not. Under his fifth proposition of law, the\ntax commissioner contests the first finding; on cross-appeal, Accel contests the\nlatter finding.\n   The BTA made no formal finding concerning the “supervision or control” of\n                        personnel supplied by Resource Staffing\n        {¶ 35} After determining that Accel’s arrangements with Resource Staffing\ntriggered the permanent-assignment exemption, the BTA stated:\n\n\n                  Moreover, Accel argues that the employees provided by\n        Resource Staffing were not “under the supervision or control of\n        another,” as is required to meet the definition of “employment\n        service” in R.C. 5739.01(JJ). The testimony of [Moises Lluberes]\n        indicated that Resource Staffing supplied supervisors, on its own\n        payroll, not Accel’s, to supervise and direct the employees provided\n        for Accel’s production activities.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                              SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6. The BTA’s decision then starts a new paragraph\naddressing a totally different subject: whether Accel’s arrangement with Manpower\ntriggered the permanent-assignment exemption.\n       {¶ 36} In his notice of appeal and his brief, the tax commissioner treats the\nstatement quoted above as if it were a finding and then argues that the BTA erred\nin making that finding. The tax commissioner points out that the contract between\nResource Staffing and Accel itself recited that the employees would be under\nAccel’s supervision and control. In its brief, Accel also treats the BTA’s statement\nas if it were a finding that the personnel did not act under Accel’s own supervision\nand control.\n       {¶ 37} We conclude that the quoted passage from the BTA’s decision does\nnot constitute a formal finding.    The passage recites an additional argument\nadvanced by Accel and alludes to its evidentiary significance, but it does not\nexplicitly draw any conclusion as to the argument’s validity. And making such a\nfinding was unnecessary, because the BTA had already found that the permanent-\nassignment exemption applied to Accel’s dealings with Resource Staffing.\nBecause there was no formal finding regarding the supervision of the employees,\nwe decline to address this contention.\nThe tax commissioner raises legal arguments that have been rejected by the case\n                                         law\n       {¶ 38} On its face, the permanent-assignment exemption of R.C.\n5739.01(JJ)(3) appears to turn on the content of the employment-services contract\nunderlying the transaction.     And consistent with that plain reading, the tax\ncommissioner’s fifth proposition of law asserts that the BTA erred by finding that\nthe permanent-assignment exemption applied regarding employees supplied to\nAccel by Resource Staffing: “When an employment services contract fails to\nprovide an express term for ‘permanent’ employees, the [BTA] cannot supply the\nmissing terms by inquiring into facts and circumstances of the employment\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nrelationship.” The tax commissioner then focuses his argument on the content of\nthe written employment-services agreement between Accel and Resource Staffing.\n       {¶ 39} But the tax commissioner is reviving an argument that this court has\nrejected in previous cases. This court has twice declined to adopt an analysis that\nnarrowly focuses on whether an employment-services contract “specifies”\npermanent assignment and has instead applied a broader facts-and-circumstances\ntest. First, in H.R. Options, Inc. v. Zaino, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2004-Ohio-1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the tax commissioner had argued to the BTA that H.R. Options’s\ncontracts with its clients contained “no contractual provision that ‘specifies\npermanent’ assignment” and that its “practice of continuous employment cannot be\noffered as evidence when no written contract provision exists.” See BTA No. 2001-\nM-808, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1813907</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *3 (Aug. 2, 2002). Neither the BTA nor this court\naccepted the tax commissioner’s contract-centered approach. Indeed, this court’s\nanalysis placed greater emphasis on the individual employment contracts between\nthe employees and the employment-services provider that were in the record than\non the overarching employment-services contracts between the provider and its\nclients. H.R. Options at ¶ 23-25.\n       {¶ 40} In H.R. Options, we articulated a test that does not emphasize the\nwording of the employment-services contract, as advocated by the tax\ncommissioner here. Instead, the test for permanent assignment has two elements:\n(1) the employee must be assigned for an indefinite period, i.e., the contract stating\nthe employee’s assignment does not specify an ending date, and (2) the employee\nmust not be provided as a substitute for a current employee who is on leave or to\nmeet seasonal or short-term-workload needs. Id. at ¶ 21. In applying the test, “both\nthe contract and the facts and circumstances of the employee’s assignment are\nfactors that must be reviewed to determine whether the employee is being assigned\non a permanent basis.” Id. Most significantly, we then approved the exemption\nfrom taxation for some of the employees based on the facts and circumstances when\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nthe employment-services contract between the provider and the client plainly did\nnot specify that they were assigned on a permanent basis. Id. at ¶ 23-24. And we\nremanded transactions involving certain other employees to the BTA for further\nreview to determine whether they were purely seasonal, i.e., nonexempt,\nassignments. Id. at ¶ 26.\n       {¶ 41} In Bay Mechanical & Elec. Corp. v. Testa, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n2012-Ohio-4312, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 19, we explained that in H.R. Options, we had\n“construed the exemption as turning on the facts of each employee’s assignment\nrather than on the presence of ‘magic words’ in the employment-service agreements\nthemselves.” We then took the additional step of holding that the presence of the\n“magic words” in the employment-services contracts could not, in light of H.R.\nOptions, be dispositive in favor of exemption. Bay Mechanical at ¶ 22.\n       {¶ 42} The tax commissioner tries to bolster his emphasis on R.C.\n5739.01(JJ)(3)’s “specifies” language with a contract-law argument. The tax\ncommissioner contends that an approach that determines the exemption’s\napplicability based on facts-and-circumstances evidence violates principles of\ncontract law by allowing course of performance to supply a contract term that is\nnot present in the actual contract. The tax commissioner maintains that because\nunder contract law, a contract term that is not set forth in the contract itself is\n“deemed to have no existence,” Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989), and therefore cannot be shown by\nextrinsic evidence, R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) cannot properly be construed to support\napplication of a facts-and-circumstances test to establish that the employees here\nwere “assigned * * * on a permanent basis” when the employment-services contract\nfailed to specify permanent assignment.\n       {¶ 43} This argument also is at odds with the case law. It cannot be\nreconciled with the facts-and-circumstances test set forth in H.R. Options and\nexplained by Bay Mechanical. Indeed, the tax commissioner’s argument had been\n\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\f                                 January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nrejected by the BTA at the time H.R. Options was decided, and those earlier\ndecisions formed the basis for the approach taken in H.R. Options. See Bay\nMechanical at ¶ 23 (“H.R. Options adopts a consistent theme sounded by the BTA\nitself when reviewing exemption claims: when ‘determining whether an exception\nor exemption to taxation applies, it is not just the form of a contract that is\nimportant,’ but instead, the ‘crucial inquiry becomes a determination of what the\nseller is providing and of what the purchaser is paying for in their agreement’ ”),\nquoting Excel Temporaries, Inc. v.

Most importantly, he points to substantial evidence\nin the record that the employee assignments at issue here may have been seasonal\nor designed to meet “short-term workload conditions,” H.R. Options, 100 Ohio\nSt.3d 373, 2004-Ohio-1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">800</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at ¶ 21. Under H.R. Options, neither of\nthose types of assignment transactions qualifies for the permanent-assignment\nexemption.      The tax commissioner in his final determination had found\n“compelling” evidence that Accel’s “labor force fluctuates with the seasons,”\nnoting the nature of its business and the fact that invoices from Manpower and\nResource Staffing demonstrated fluctuating payroll dollar amounts with heaviest\nspending on employee labor from August through December, and therefore had\ndetermined that the employees were “seasonal in nature.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f                                  SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\n         {¶ 46} In arriving at a contrary conclusion regarding employees supplied by\nResource Staffing, the BTA relied primarily on the testimony of Accel’s chief\nfinancial officer, Daniel Harms, and Moises Lluberes, the chief financial officer of\nResource Staffing. The gist of their testimony was that Accel sought to have\nemployees return for job after job once they had been trained and that during\nperiods when less work was available, Resource Staffing would reduce the hours\nthe employees worked rather than discharging them. Lluberes specifically testified\nthat Resource Staffing supplied 647 persons to Accel as employees from 2006\nthrough 2011 (when its contract with Accel ended) and that about 358 of those\nemployees worked more than one year at Accel.1 Lluberes also testified that\nResource Staffing would not reassign personnel placed with Accel to other clients\nwhen the workload at Accel decreased. The BTA relied on this testimony to\nconclude that the personnel supplied by Resource Staffing were “assigned on a\npermanent basis.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *5.\n         {¶ 47} Although there is no question that the number of Resource Staffing\nworkers at Accel fluctuated significantly throughout the year and was greatest\nduring the fall as the holidays approached, the BTA concluded that the retention of\nthe same personnel through high-activity and low-activity periods negated their\nstatus as seasonal employees. This is best viewed as an aspect of the BTA’s factual\ndetermination that merits our deference.\n         {¶ 48} Ultimately, the distinction between seasonal or short-term-workload\nemployment and more regular employment is one of degree, not of kind. In every\nenterprise, the workload may experience periods of ebb and flow. It seems entirely\n\n1\n  Lluberes testified in part based on an exhibit that the BTA in its decision ultimately struck from\nthe record. The exhibit was a document stating the names and tenures of employees supplied by\nResource Staffing to Accel and was prepared at Lluberes’s direction by Resource Staffing’s\naccounting department. But even if he had not stated precise numbers, Lluberes’s testimony\nexplained the nature of the permanent-assignment relationship, as to which he was not cross-\nexamined. And the tax commissioner did not move to strike Lluberes’s general testimony regarding\nthe employees’ tenures, which appeared to rely on a foundation beyond that of the excluded exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n                                                18\n\f                                January Term, 2017\n\n\n\n\nreasonable, therefore, that what matters in an ebb-and-flow business for purposes\nof R.C. 5739.01(JJ)(3) and our precedents is the continuity of the workforce, i.e.,\nare the same workers having their hours adjusted or are new workers being brought\nin to handle the extra work during the busy season only? Based on Lluberes’s\ntestimony, the BTA found the former to be true. Under H.R. Options, bringing back\nthe same workers each time with differing hours is consistent with permanent\nassignment; using new workers just for a brief workload spike is not.\n       {¶ 49} The tax commissioner argues that Lluberes’s testimony was so\nbiased that the BTA could not have reasonably relied on it. But as discussed, we\nreview the BTA’s weighing of evidence and determinations of witness credibility\nunder an abuse-of-discretion standard, meaning that we will reverse a decision of\nthe BTA only if we detect an arbitrary or unconscionable attitude.

Although Lluberes undeniably had a business interest\nin relation to his testimony, the BTA did not abuse its discretion by crediting that\ntestimony in spite of any possible bias.\n The BTA Reasonably Concluded that Accel Did Not Show that Manpower\n                     Personnel Were Permanently Assigned\n       {¶ 50} On cross-appeal, Accel argues that the BTA erred by regarding the\nevidence as insufficient to establish that the personnel supplied by Manpower were\nalso permanent-assignment employees. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4410600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *6. Accel\nchallenges that finding by pointing to the affidavit of its president, David Abraham.\n       {¶ 51} Abraham’s affidavit summarily recited that no written agreement\nexisted with Manpower but that the parties contemplated “a long term relationship\nof at least one year” and that Accel requested that the employees be assigned\nindefinitely because they would have been trained and exposed to confidential\nmanufacturing processes. The affidavit also detailed some types of work performed\n\n\n\n\n                                           19\n\f                            SUPREME COURT OF OHIO\n\n\n\n\nby the employees. Notably, the affidavit did not even address the question of\nseasonal labor.\n       {¶ 52} We reject Accel’s contention that the BTA erred by failing to grant\nexemption based on the affidavit. Accel bore the burden of proof to show that it\nwas entitled to a tax exemption, but it adduced a much smaller quantum of proof\nwith respect to the Manpower transactions than it did regarding the transactions\ninvolving Resource Staffing, failing to even address central concerns regarding the\napplicability of the exemption for the transactions involving Manpower. Under\nthese circumstances, Accel has failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\nR.C. 5703.58(B) Is Inapplicable Because It Became Law after the Issuance of\n                             the Assessment at Issue\n       {¶ 53} R.C. 5703.58(B) prohibits the tax commissioner from “mak[ing] or\nissu[ing] an assessment against a consumer for any tax due under Chapter 5741 of\nthe Revised Code, or for any penalty, interest, or additional charge on such tax, if\nthe tax was due before January 1, 2008.” Accel argues on cross-appeal that this\nprovision applies to this case. If the provision is applicable, it would bar a\nconsiderable portion of the tax commissioner’s assessment.\n       {¶ 54} But the provision was enacted as part of 2011 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 153,\nand it became effective on September 29, 2011. The tax commissioner issued his\nassessment on January 18, 2011. Because the provision was not in effect when the\ntax commissioner issued his assessment, it did not bar the issuance of that\nassessment. We therefore affirm the BTA’s ruling on this point.\nThe BTA Did Not Abuse Its Discretion Regarding the Expert Testimony and\n                                Experts’ Reports\n       {¶ 55} On various grounds, each party contests the other party’s expert\ntestimony and expert’s written report offered into evidence at the BTA hearing.\nOur starting point for evaluating the arguments is that we accord the BTA wide\ndiscretion in evaluating proffered expert testimony.

It\nfollows that the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard is applicable to the\narguments advanced regarding the experts.\n       {¶ 56} The need for considering those arguments, however, is obviated by\nthe fact that the BTA’s decision sets forth extensive analysis in support of its\nconclusions without relying on evidence offered by either expert. When “nothing\nin the BTA’s decision” indicates that exhibits “were given any weight,” we have\nheld that “any error in admitting [the] exhibits” constitutes “harmless error.”\nHigbee Co. v.
