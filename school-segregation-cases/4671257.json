Renninger and his wife, Patsy D. Renninger,\n\nappeal from the judgment of November 12, 2015. We affirm.\n\n        On May 25, 2007, Appellant Dennis Renninger was at work in the\n\nClarion,    Pennsylvania      plant    of      his   employer,   Commodore   Homes\n\n(“Commodore”), a manufacturer of modular homes, when he sustained a\n\nserious injury to his foot.       While under construction, each modular home\n\nmoves along an assembly on wheeled casters attached to its underside. Mr.\n\nRenninger was injured when a caster ran over his foot.              Appellants sued\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nAppellees A&R Machine Shop (“A&R”)1 and Cass Hudson Company (“Cass\n\nHudson”) as the designers, manufacturers and suppliers of the casters.\n\nAppellants alleged causes of action for strict products liability, negligence,\n\nbreach of implied warranty, and loss of consortium causes of action, claiming\n\nthe casters should have included toe guards. The case proceeded to a June\n\n22-25, 2015 jury trial on Appellants’ strict products liability/design defect\n\nclaim.2     The jury returned a defense verdict, finding Cass Hudson did not\n\nsupply a defective product.         Appellants filed timely post-trial motions on\n\nJune 30, 2015. The trial court denied those motions on November 3, 2015.\n\nThe verdict was reduced to judgment on November 12, 2015, and this timely\n\nappeal followed.\n\n       Appellant raises seven assertions of error, which we have reordered\n\nfor clarity of analysis:\n\n       I.     Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in denying [Appellants’] motion for post-trial relief\n              which requested in the alternative either: (1) an order of\n              a judgment notwithstanding the verdict setting aside the\n              jury’s verdict and issuing an award for [Appellants], or (2)\n              ordering a new trial in this matter, where the issuance of\n              such an order was clearly supported by the evidentiary\n              record and controlling case law and the denial of such\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n  Appellants and A&R reached a settlement agreement prior to trial. A&R is\nnot participating in this appeal.\n2\n    The trial court entered summary judgment in Appellees’ favor on\nAppellants’ manufacturing defect and failure to warn products liability causes\nof action.   Appellants withdrew the negligence and breach of implied\nwarranty claims prior to trial.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n              request deprived [Appellants] of an adequate statutory or\n              legal remedy and was clearly contrary to the applicable\n              case law.\n\n       II.    Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in finding that it properly allowed evidence and\n              testimony of industry standards and employer conduct to\n              be considered by the jury.\n\n       III.   Whether the trial court erred in its April 17, 2015 order on\n              motions in limine where it expressly stated that the\n              Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling in [Tincher3] allowed\n              for the introduction of the following at trial:\n\n              (a)    Industry safety standards;\n              (b)    OSHA safety standards;\n              (c)    Employer conduct; and\n              (d)    Conduct of third parties, including but not limited to\n                     assumption of risk by [Mr. Renninger].\n\n       IV.    Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in finding that it properly instructed the jury on the\n              question of defective design of a product. Specifically,\n              whether the court erred when it instructed the jury on the\n              factors to consider in applying the risk utility analysis\n              required pursuant to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\n              decision in [Tincher], when it instructed the jury to\n              consider a seven-part test which was not adopted by the\n              [Tincher] decision.\n\n       V.     Whether the trial court erred when it failed to properly\n              craft a jury verdict question and failed to place such jury\n              questions in a sequence that resulted in the jury deciding\n              the case before being asked to apply the risk utility\n              analysis required by [Tincher].           Specifically, jury\n              questions 1 and 2, which were generic questions that did\n              not require the application of the risk utility analysis, and\n              consequently this case was decided without the application\n              of risk utility by the jury.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n    Tincher v.

Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n             erred in finding that it properly disallowed a jury\n             instruction on the doctrine of intended use in the context\n             of products liability design defect cases pursuant to the\n             Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in [Tincher].\n\n      VII.   Whether the trial court erred in its January 27, 2011 order\n             on [Appellees’] motions for summary judgment where it\n             misapplied Pa.R.C.P. [No.] 1035.2, in that it relied upon an\n             affidavit to prematurely grant summary judgment in favor\n             of [Appellees] before the close of discovery and dismissed\n             certain counts of [Appellants’] amended complaint; and\n             more importantly used that same affidavit to conclude that\n             the third party/employer was the designer of the subject\n             product, and that neither [Appellee] designed the wheeled\n             caster assemblies at issue.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 4-6.\n\n      Before we analyze Appellants’ legal arguments, we will review the\n\nfacts introduced at trial.   Mr. Renninger’s job at Commodore was to help\n\nbuild and finish roofs. N.T Trial, 6/22/15, at 60. Mr. Renninger’s plant built\n\nroughly ten to twelve homes at one time. N.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 21. The\n\nhomes under construction moved around the assembly line on casters bolted\n\nto their undersides.   Id. at 22, 24. Originally, Commodore positioned the\n\ncasters several feet inside of the home’s outer frame, such that a moving\n\ncaster could not run over the foot of a person standing alongside a moving\n\nhome. Id. at 22-23, 92, 114-15; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 96. Commodore\n\nrepositioned the casters to the outer edge of the homes to prevent bowing in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nthe floor joists.4     Id.; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 58.     Commodore modified\n\ntwenty casters to accommodate the new location. R 796-802. Cass Hudson\n\nand A&R Machine subsequently supplied additional casters fabricated to\n\nmeet the new specifications. Id. The twenty modified casters remained in\n\nuse at the time of Mr. Renninger’s accident, and it was not possible to\n\ndistinguish the casters Commodore modified from the unmodified casters\n\nsubsequently supplied by Cass Hudson. Id.\n\n         Mr. Renninger’s accident occurred while he was on the plant floor\n\nspeaking to his foreman.          N.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 26-28.   Mr. Renninger\n\ntestified that Commodore never trained its employees on Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) regulations regarding the plant\n\nfloor.    Id. at 85.    Mr. Renninger was not aware of any OSHA regulation\n\nrequiring the use of steel-toed boots on the plant floor, and he did not own\n\nsteel-toed boots on the date of the accident. Id. at 83-85. He was wearing\n\ntennis shoes when the accident occurred, and he was aware that the casters\n\ndid not have a guard to prevent the wheel from running over a foot. Id. at\n\n80. Mr. Renninger also testified that the plant floor was not level, such that\n\nsome of the wheels underneath a moving modular home would touch the\n\nground while others did not.         Id. at 85-86.   Mr. Renninger believed a toe\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4\n   The record indicates that Commodore switched from mobile to modular\nhomes the year before Mr. Renninger’s accident. The interior placement of\nthe casters worked for mobile homes but caused bowing in the floors of the\nmodular homes.\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nguard on the caster would have prevented his injury.      Id. at 96-97.   Mr.\n\nRenninger did not believe a steel-toed boot would have prevented his injury.\n\nId. at 97.\n\n       Richard Guzicki an employee of Appellee Cass Hudson who helped\n\nhandle the Commodore account, testified that Cass Hudson is a distributor of\n\ncasters and wheels. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 5. Cass Hudson consults with its\n\ncustomers to determine an appropriate caster for their needs. Id. at 5, 17.\n\nDale Toney, director of special operations for Commodore, testified that he\n\nrelied on Guzicki to supply an appropriate wheel for the height and weight.\n\nId. at 80, 83, 110.        According to Guzicki, Cass Hudson does not advise\n\ncustomers on the need for toe guards in a given application, and does not\n\nanalyze the safety needs at a customer’s plant.      Id. at 43-45.   Likewise,\n\nCass Hudson personnel did not visit the plant where the accident occurred.\n\nId. at 47. Thus, Cass Hudson had no opportunity to observe the condition\n\nof the plant floor.5\n\n       Delbert Miller, one of the owners of A&R Machine Shop (“A&R”),\n\ntestified that A&R fabricated the brackets that held the casters to the\n\nmodular homes. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 57. Cass Hudson is one of A&R’s\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n    We observe that the plant closed shortly after the accident. Cass\nHudson’s legal team never had an opportunity to examine the plant, the\nfloor, or the caster that caused the injury.\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nlargest customers. Id. at 67-68. Like Guzicki, Miller never visited the plant\n\nwhere the accident occurred. Id. at 69.\n\n      Both parties produced expert witnesses.      Paul Dreyer, a mechanical\n\nengineer and Appellants’ expert witness, described the roles of Commodore,\n\nCass Hudson, and A&R:\n\n             Okay. Commodore is the manufacturer of the modular\n      homes, so they know modular homes. A&R Machine is basically\n      a machine shop that builds metal fabricated parts, things that\n      drill holes and a certain size and shape. They supplied a metal\n      fabric part which they called a bracket to Cass Hudson. And\n      Cass Hudson took the bracket and mounted it to the caster\n      assembly and then supplied it directly to Commodore to be used\n      underneath the modular home.\n\nN.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 114. Dreyer testified that the casters attached to the\n\nouter edge of the modular homes were defective because they lacked a toe\n\nguard. Id. at 117.\n\n            [T]he main reason why a toe guard is important for this\n      particular application is because this is a very large wheel with a\n      very heavy load. That can be very dangerous. And because of\n      that circumstance, it needed to be—the workers needed to be\n      protected from the possible movement of that very heavy load\n      onto their foot.\n\nId. at 117-18.\n\n      Further:\n\n            For this particular caster assembly to have, like I\n      mentioned, a large wheel which has no guarding, no protection,\n      which is—could instill a very serious injury on a worker who is\n      paying attention to his job and not thinking that there’s an\n      imminent hazard, imminent danger right below him until\n      obviously after it occurred. And if this caster had a guard\n      assembly, a toe guard assembly, it might have pinched his foot\n      but pushed it out of the way so it wouldn’t be ridden completely\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n     over and partially—according to the documents, partially up his\n     ankle before they could get it off of his foot and cause that\n     serious injury.\n\nId. at 120.   In Dreyer’s opinion, the toe guard was preferable to using\n\nanother worker as a spotter, and it was also preferable to using a buzzer or\n\nbeeper on a moving modular home.       Id. at 121.   A spotter may not see\n\neverything, and a buzzer might not get the attention of a worker wearing ear\n\nprotection. Id. Multiple homes moving along the assembly line and beeping\n\ncould cause confusion. Id.\n\n     Dreyer stated that Cass Hudson’s suppliers offer toe guards for sale in\n\ntheir catalogues, but he acknowledged that a toe guard for the casters\n\nCommodore purchased would have needed to be custom designed.          Id. at\n\n118. A custom designed toe guard would have increased the cost of each\n\ncaster by 10 to 12 percent. Id. at 123-25. Dreyer said it should have been\n\nobvious to Cass Hudson that a toe guard was necessary, once the casters\n\nwere moved to the outer edge of the modular homes. Id. at 206.\n\n     Dreyer believed the use of a toe guard would have been in accord with\n\nindustry standards. “The caster industry has done that analysis and come\n\nup with a couple of different toe guard designs, and I have my faith in their\n\nindustry that that design minimizes injury.”    Id. at 161.    Commodore’s\n\ncompliance, or lack thereof, with OSHA regulations was not relevant to\n\nDreyer’s analysis of the product design. Id. at 201, 209.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n      The defense expert, Gary Hutter, testified that no industry standard\n\nrequires heavy-duty casters to have toe guards. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 167-\n\n68.\n\n            Q.    Is that a standard that exists in the wheel supply\n      industry?\n\n            A.    No, it is not. It’s not a standard in the wheel supply\n      industry, nor is it a requirement by OSHA. I’m on an ANSI\n      [American National Standards Institute] committee that’s\n      involved with casters. I voted on two of their standards. It’s not\n      a requirement in those standards either.\n\n            Q.    Do you know of any law, any regulation, any\n      standard or any literature that coincides with Mr. Dreyer’s\n      opinion that all heavy-duty casters must contain guards?\n\n            A.    No, I’m not aware of anything like that.\n\n            Q.    Have you ever heard any person or any expert offer\n      that opinion at any other time than in this case?\n\n            A.    No, I have not.\n\n            Q.    Can you tell us what the standard is with regard to a\n      reasonable seller of a caster dolly and wheels such as that we’re\n      dealing with here?\n\n            A.     Well, in essence, the caster dolly is a component in a\n      product, the product being the—this house that’s being made,\n      and it’s a component someone’s buying—\n\n            [At this point, Appellants’ Counsel successfully objected to\n      Hutter’s characterization of the caster as a component of the\n      modular home]\n\n            Q.   Setting aside components, what is the—what is the\n      standard of what a reasonable seller is expected to comply with\n      when they are selling a caster dolly as was sold in this particular\n      case.\n\n           A.    In essence, that it would be compliant with codes\n      and standards, that it would be reasonably safe, that it would\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       perform the utility as they understood the utility to be, those\n       kinds of things.\n\n            Q.    And in this particular case, is it your opinion that\n       Cass Hudson complied with the standard—the applicable\n       standard that you just indicated or that it did not comply?\n\n              A.     Yes, that it did.[6]\n\nId. at 169-71.\n\n       Hutter further elaborated on the ANSI standards:\n\n              Now, wheels have been around for a long time; and most\n       of the wheels we encounter do not have any kind of wheel\n       bearings on them. Now, in some situations, maybe a wheel\n       bearing makes sense; but let’s see if the codes and standards\n       require wheel bearings. When I went to the ANSI code—and\n       ANSI is American National Standards Institute. They have codes\n       on casters and wheels. I voted on their standards on those\n       issues. They do not require that wheel guard or any wheel\n       guard is mandatory on—on this kind of product. You go to the\n       codes and standards and you look. Well, what do we need? And\n       I’ve said this repeatedly. You have a trained person. You have\n       spotters. You—you have safety shoes. You make sure the area\n       is clean. In addition, you might use a horn. You might use a\n       light. You might use other kinds of communication. You make\n       sure that there isn’t going to be a problem because this would be\n       like driving a heavy forklift truck and not being able to see\n       what’s in front of you.\n\nId. at 226.     As we will explain below, Appellants have not developed any\n\nargument challenging Hutter’s testimony that Appellee’s casters met\n\nindustry and ANSI standards.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n  Given this testimony, Appellee’s assertion that it introduced no evidence of\nindustry standards is incorrect. See Appellee’s Brief at 11.\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       Hutter confirmed that Cass Hudson was not in the fabrication business\n\nand could not have fabricated a toe guard for Commodore’s casters. Id. at\n\n174. It would have been impossible to design an appropriate guard without\n\nknowing the contours of the floor:\n\n              Well, first of all, there’s been some discussion about the\n       undulation of the floor of the building where this is being\n       manufactured; and if you have a guard and then try to—I\n       believe Mr. Toney […] wanted it to be close to the floor obviously\n       so that a toe or foot can’t get underneath there; but because the\n       floor goes up and down—which normally a floor would because it\n       would have drains in it, because concrete is never made\n       perfectly flat, because there are expansion joints and all those\n       kinds of things, that if he put it too close to the floor, it would be\n       a problem. And it would gouge into the floor. And if he put it,\n       obviously, too high, it’s not going to protect too many people\n       unless they have a very big shoe on or something like that. So\n       you’d have to know that information about the floor.\n\nId. at 175\n\n       Hutter believed Cass Hudson did not have the information it needed to\n\nmake a safety recommendation, and was not aware that spotters and safety\n\nshoes were not in use, as its personnel never visited the plant. Id. at 212,\n\n219.   Hutter also stated that toe guards present their own risk of injury,\n\nincluding running over electric cords or hoses.      Id. at 182. Hutter opined\n\nthat toe guards did not pass his risk-utility analysis because they would not\n\nnecessarily protect a worker’s foot and they pose additional hazards. Id. at\n\n196-97, 224-25.      Hutter would not have recommended the use of a toe\n\nguard on the casters in question. Id. at 213. Hutter did not believe it was\n\ncertain that a toe guard would have prevented Mr. Renninger’s accident. Id.\n\n\n\n                                      - 11 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nat 191, 196.          Mr. Renninger’s soft tennis shoes could have slipped\n\nunderneath a toe guard, depending on where he stood and the gap between\n\nthe toe guard and the floor at that location. Id. at 196.\n\n        Hutter testified that utility carts used to carry thousands of pounds of\n\nsteel, concrete, or brick generally do not have toe guards on the wheels. Id.\n\nat 187. Similarly, the industrial carts at retailers such as Home Depot do not\n\nhave toe guards. Id. at 188. Hutter claimed the use of a spotter and safety\n\nshoes are the most successful methods of preventing the injury Mr.\n\nRenninger sustained.      Id. at 192-93, 201-02.        The toe of a typical safety\n\nshoe rises two inches above the sole, such that a caster would be unlikely to\n\nroll over the wearer’s foot. Id. at 208. The wheel would bump the safety\n\nshoe and the wearer would have time to move his foot clear of the wheel’s\n\npath.    Id. at 208-09.         Persons operating the machine that pushes the\n\nmodular home are required to comply with government safety standards.\n\nId. at 194. In sum, Hutter did not believe Cass Hudson supplied defective\n\ncasters. Id. at 198. Hutter believed an unsafe workplace, rather than the\n\nlack of a toe guard, caused Mr. Renninger’s injury. Id. at 198-99.\n\n        We now turn to Appellants’ legal arguments. Appellants argue the trial\n\ncourt    erred   in   denying    their   motion   for   a   new   trial   or   judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict (“JNOV”). “Our standard of review regarding a\n\ntrial court’s denial of a motion for a new trial is limited. The power to grant\n\na new trial lies inherently with the trial court and we will not reverse its\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\ndecision absent a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law which controls\n\nthe outcome of the case.”     Kaplan v. O'Kane, 835 A.2d 735, 737 (Pa.\n\nSuper. 2003) (quoting Siegal v. Stefanyszyn, M.D., 718 A.2d 1274, 1275\n\n(Pa. Super. 1998)).   The following governs our review of the trial court’s\n\ndenial of JNOV:\n\n           JNOV is the proper remedy in a civil case where the\n     evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain the verdict.\n     Nonetheless, JNOV is an extreme remedy which is properly\n     entered by the trial court only in a case where, after viewing the\n     evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, the\n     facts are so clear that no two reasonable minds could fail to\n     agree that the verdict, as rendered by the jury, was improper.\n     JNOV, however, may not be employed to invade the province of\n     the jury. Thus, when there is a question of fact to be resolved, it\n     is within the sole purview of the jury. JNOV should not be\n     entered where evidence is conflicting upon a material fact.\n     Thus, where the jury has been presented with conflicting\n     evidence, a motion for JNOV should be denied.\n\nRohm & Haas Co. v. Cont'l Cas. Co., 732 A.2d 1236, 1248 (Pa. Super.\n\n1999) (emphasis in original), affirmed, 781 A.2d 1172 (Pa. 2001).\n\n     Appellants’ first three assertions of error challenge the trial court’s\n\ndecision to admit evidence of industry safety standards, OSHA safety\n\nstandards, and Mr. Renninger’s alleged assumption of risk.          “Questions\n\nconcerning the admission and exclusion of evidence are within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an\n\nabuse of discretion.” B & L Asphalt Indus., Inc. v. Fusco, 753 A.2d 264,\n\n270 (Pa. Super. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                    - 13 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       For many years, our law prohibited the introduction of industry\n\nstandards evidence in a strict liability case, the rationale being that under\n\n§ 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts,7 “it is the product itself which\n\nis on trial, and not the manufacturer’s conduct.”     Lewis v. Coffing Hoist\n\nDiv., Duff-Norton Co., Inc., 580 A.2d 590, 593 (Pa. 1987).             Industry\n\nstandards evidence “improperly focuses on the quality of the defendant’s\n\nconduct in making its design choice, and not on the attributes of the product\n\nitself.”   Id. at 594 (citing Lenhardt v. Ford Motor Co., 683 P.2d 1097\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n    Section 402A provides:\n\n       § 402A Special Liability of Seller of Product for Physical Harm to\n       User or Consumer\n\n       (1) One who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably\n       dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to\n       liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or\n       consumer, or to his property, if\n\n              (a) the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a\n              product, and\n\n              (b) it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer\n              without substantial change in the condition in which it is sold.\n\n       (2) The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although\n\n              (a) the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation\n              and sale of his product, and\n\n              (b) the user or consumer has not bought the product from or\n              entered into any contractual relation with the seller.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 402A.\n\n\n\n                                          - 14 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n(Wash. 1984)).      Furthermore, “if a manufacturer’s product has design\n\nattributes which make it unsafe for its intended use, there is no relevance in\n\nthe fact that such a design is widespread in the industry.” Id.\n\n      In   other   words,   Lewis   espoused   a   strict   separation   between\n\nnegligence principles and strict liability causes of action. The Lewis Court\n\ngleaned that principle from Azzarello v. Black Bros., Co., 391 A.2d 1020,\n\n1023 (Pa. 1978), which our Supreme Court in Tincher expressly overruled.\n\nTincher, 104 A.3d at 335. Under Azzarello, the trial court decided, as a\n\nmatter of social policy, whether a product was unreasonably dangerous,\n\nwithin the meaning of § 402A. Id. at 367. If the trial court found a product\n\nunreasonably dangerous, it submitted the case to a jury, which then\n\ndetermined whether plaintiffs proved the allegations in their complaint by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Id. The Tincher Court noted: “[f]ollowing\n\nAzzarello, decisional focus in strict liability cases shifted to reflect an\n\nincreasing concern with segregating strict liability and negligence concepts.”\n\nId.   The Tincher Court went on to discuss Lewis in detail, but it did not\n\nexpressly overrule Lewis, or any case other than Azzarello.          See id. at\n\n368-69. The Supreme Court wrote:\n\n            We recognize—and the bench and bar should recognize—\n      that the decision to overrule Azzarello and articulate a standard\n      of proof premised upon alternative tests in relation to claims of a\n      product defective in design may have an impact upon other\n      foundational issues regarding manufacturing or warning claims,\n      and upon subsidiary issues constructed from Azzarello, such as\n      the availability of negligence-derived defenses, bystander\n      compensation, or the proper application of the intended use\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n      doctrine. These considerations and effects are outside the scope\n      of the facts of this dispute[.]\n\nId. at 409 (emphasis added).\n\n      Ultimately, the Tincher Court held that a plaintiff may show a\n\ndefective condition by showing either that “(1) the danger is unknowable\n\nand unacceptable to the average or ordinary consumer, or that (2) a\n\nreasonable person would conclude that the probability and seriousness of\n\nharm caused by the product outweigh the burden or costs of taking\n\nprecautions.”    Id. at 335.    These tests present issues of fact for a jury,\n\nexcept where it is clear that reasonable minds cannot differ on an issue. Id.\n\n      Presently at issue in this design defect case is the second of these\n\ntests, known as the risk-utility test.    Throughout its Tincher opinion, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the risk-utility test is derived from negligence\n\nprinciples.     Specifically, the Court quoted then-Justice Saylor:                “In\n\napplication to design defect claims, the concurrence […] observed, courts in\n\nPennsylvania recognized ‘an integral role for risk-utility (or cost-benefit)\n\nbalancing, derived from negligence theory.’” Id. at 371 (quoting Phillips v.\n\nCricket   Lighters,    841     A.2d   1000      (Pa.   2003)   (OAJC)   (Saylor,    J.\n\nconcurring)); see also id. at 373-74 (quoting Bugosh v. I.U. North Am.,\n\nInc., 971 A.2d 1228 (Pa. 2009) (Saylor, J., joined by Castille, C.J.,\n\ndissenting)).    Justice Saylor opined that a higher threshold of fault is\n\nappropriate in design defect cases, where a plaintiff’s verdict suggests that\n\nan entire product line is defective.     Id.    Further, the Court noted that the\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nLewis Court’s distinction between negligence and strict liability principles\n\nwas in “harmony” with Azzarello. Id. at 368.\n\n       Despite the Supreme Court’s apparent recognition that the effects of\n\nTincher would be far reaching, and despite its analysis of the negligence\n\nunderpinnings of the risk-utility test Appellants rely upon in this case,\n\nAppellants largely sidestep the issue: “Nowhere in the Tincher decision did\n\nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court allow for the consideration of negligence\n\nprinciples in products liability cases.” Appellants’ Brief at 13. Appellants cite\n\npages 399 and 410 of Tincher as evidence that the Supreme Court\n\n“specifically refused to adopt a theory of products liability which included\n\nnegligence theory and principles.” Id. at 15. On page 399 of Tincher, the\n\ncourt recognized the limits of Dean Wade’s seven-part analysis, and\n\nrecognizes the shortcomings of the risk-utility test.    Tincher, 104 A.3d at\n\n399.   Nowhere does the Court state that negligence principles will not be\n\nrelevant in a case where a plaintiff relies on risk-utility to establish a\n\ndefective product. Likewise, on page 410, the Tincher Court explains some\n\nof its reasons for declining to adopt the Third Restatement.        Id. at 410.\n\nNothing on page 410 supports a conclusion that the Tincher Court intended\n\nto maintain a strict division between negligence and strict liability principles\n\nin the risk-utility test.   Indeed, on the prior page (quoted above with\n\nemphasis added) the Supreme Court recognized that its holding could have\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nan impact on, among other things, the availability of negligence-based\n\ndefenses. Id. at 409.\n\n       With this background, we now turn to the specifics of Appellants’\n\nargument.     Appellants’ filed a pretrial motion in limine seeking to exclude\n\nevidence of industry standards applicable to casters of the type at issue in\n\nthis case and OSHA standards applicable to the Commodore plant where Mr.\n\nRenninger worked.         The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that\n\n“[industry] standards may supply the jury with a useful starting point from\n\nwhich to evaluate the caster’s design.” Trial Court Opinion, 4/17/2015, at\n\n21.8   As described above, Appellee introduced evidence of ANSI standards\n\ngoverning casters.       Hutter testified that no industry standard required the\n\nuse of toe guards on casters.           Appellee, through Hutter, also introduced\n\nevidence     of   OSHA     violations    at    Commodore,   and   safety   measures\n\nCommodore could have taken to prevent Mr. Renninger’s injury, and\n\nevidence of Mr. Renninger’s assumption of risk.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n8\n   Appellee argues in its brief that Appellants opened the door to industry\nstandards evidence because their expert was the first to address it at trial.\nThis argument is not well taken. After their unsuccessful motion in limine,\nAppellants had the right to devise an appropriate trial strategy.           See\nSprague v. Walter, 656 A.2d 890, 906 (Pa. Super. 1995) (“Having received\nan unfavorable ruling on its motion to exclude all such evidence, [the party]\nwas entitled to use that evidence to its best advantage in order to try to win\nthe case, and not be forced to wait for possible vindication of the trial court’s\nadverse ruling.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 18 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       Surprisingly, Appellants do not address Hutter’s discussion of industry\n\nstandards governing casters, or even cite to portions of the record where\n\nHutter offered that testimony.             Appellants used the phrase industry\n\nstandards in their question presented and again in their brief, but they\n\nconfined the substance of their record citations and legal argument to the\n\nevidence of Commodore’s conduct and OSHA violations.9 Appellants’ Brief at\n\n12, 21. We will therefore do the same. See Pa.R.A.P. 2119(c) (requiring\n\nappellants to support arguments with pertinent citations to the record).\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n9\n   This argument is consistent with Appellants’ counsel’s argument during\nthe colloquy on the proposed points for charge:\n\n       APPELLEE’S COUNSEL: We do request 25 and 26 or an amalgam\n            of the two so that they realize it is relevant to consider the\n            industry standards that they’ve heard about. It’s not a\n            dispositive, but it’s relevant as to whether or not a seller\n            acted reasonably.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL: Compliance with industry standards,\n            you were talking about industry standards with regard to\n            workplace not with regard to the product.\n\n       APPELLEE’S COUNSEL: No. We talked about it with regard to\n            the product too. It doesn’t violate any industry standards.\n            That was pretty clearly said by Dr. Hutter.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL: No.\n\n       APPELLEE’S COUNSEL: No, it wasn’t.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL:               He   covered   employer   employer\n            employer.\n\nN.T. Trial, 6/25/2015 a.m., at 30-31.\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n      Concerning Commodore’s conduct, and the alleged OSHA violations,\n\nAppellants cite three specific portions of the trial transcript. Appellants’ Brief\n\nat 12, 21. First, at pages 178 through 181 of the June 24, 2015 transcript,\n\nHutter discussed the lack of safety shoes, trained industrial truck operators,\n\nand spotters, the uneven floor, and other potential hazards at the\n\nCommodore plant. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 178-81. Hutter also explained his\n\nreasons for opining that a toe guard would not necessarily prevent the type\n\nof injury Mr. Renninger sustained. Id.\n\n      Next, Appellants cite pages 191 to 196 of the June 24, 2015 transcript.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 12, 21. On these pages, Hutter further elaborated on his\n\nreasons for believing a toe guard would not necessarily prevent a foot injury.\n\nN.T Trial, 6/24/15, at 191-92, 195-96. Likewise, Hutter further elaborated\n\non his opinion that Commodore failed to provide proper supervision and\n\nfootwear. Id. at 193. Hutter stated that Commodore was cited for an OSHA\n\nviolation as a result of these deficiencies. Id. at 193-195.\n\n      Finally, Appellants cite pages 198-99 of the June 24, 2015 transcript,\n\nwherein Hutter testified that Mr. Renninger’s injury was a result of\n\nCommodore’s     OSHA    violations   and   Mr.   Renninger’s   own   negligence.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 12, 21; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 198-99. As noted above,\n\nin none of these portions of the transcript did Hutter reference industry\n\nstandards applicable to casters.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n     Appellants rely in part on Sheehan v. Cincinnati Shaper Co., 555\n\nA.2d 1352 (Pa. Super. 1989), appeal denied, 564 A.2d 1261 (Pa. 1989). In\n\nSheehan, as in the instant case, the defendant argued that the plaintiff’s\n\nemployer’s OSHA violations were relevant to causation. The defendant sold\n\na shear to the plaintiff’s employer and argued that OSHA regulations\n\nrequired the employer to provide safety guards for use with the shear. Id.\n\nat 1354. We rejected the defendant’s argument:\n\n           Although Shaper attempts to couch its argument in terms\n     of causation, it fails to explain how OSHA standards are relevant\n     to that issue. The essence of Shaper’s argument is that Shaper\n     acted reasonably by designing the shear without a safety guard\n     since OSHA standards place the responsibility of providing a\n     safety guard on the buyer/employer.\n\n                                   [***]\n\n           We conclude that the OSHA regulations proffered would\n     introduce into a strict liability action the reasonableness of\n     Shaper’s failure to provide the new safety device for this\n     machine, an issue irrelevant to whether liability attaches.\n     Accordingly, the trial court did not err by sustaining Sheehan's\n     objections to the introduction of this evidence.\n\nId. at 1354-55. Thus, the Sheehan Court employed the strict separation\n\nbetween negligence and strict liability, set forth in Lewis in “harmony” with\n\nAzzarello.    See Tincher, 104 A.3d at 368 (discussing Lewis and\n\nAzzarello).\n\n     Likewise, Appellants cite Majdic v. Cincinnati Mach. Co., 537 A.2d\n\n334 (Pa. Super. 1988) (en banc), to support their argument that a plaintiff’s\n\nemployer’s conduct is not relevant in a strict products liability action. The\n\n\n\n                                   - 21 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nplaintiff operated a power press used for “the punching, stamping, bending,\n\nor sheering of metal.” Id. at 336. There, the defendant provided a press\n\nbrake, which plaintiff’s employer then incorporated into its manufacturing\n\nsystem.     Id. at 336-37.    Plaintiff alleged the press brake was defective\n\nbecause “it did not contain a guard which would have prevented the\n\noperator’s hands from entering the point of operation.”            Id. at 336.   The\n\ndefendant    argued   that    “the    press      brake   was   a   general   purpose,\n\nmultifunctional unit which was unequipped with dies and had no point of\n\noperation when sold.” Id. at 337. Thus, “only [plaintiff’s employer], which\n\nincorporated the press brake into its manufacturing system, could determine\n\nand install the guards and warnings necessary for the particular function\n\nassigned to the press.”      Id.     The defendant introduced evidence of ANSI\n\nstandards for power presses and evidence that it was industry custom for\n\nthe purchaser of a press brake to provide the necessary safety devices. Id.\n\nat 338.    Citing Lewis, decided the year before Majdic, the Majdic Court\n\nheld that the trial court erred in permitting the ANSI evidence and evidence\n\nof industry custom.     Id. at 338-39.           The Majdic Court rejected such\n\nevidence because it implicated the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s\n\nconduct.\n\n     Appellants do not address whether Tincher has any implications for\n\nthe continued vitality of Sheehan or Majdic.             Assuming without deciding\n\nthat the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Commodore’s conduct\n\n\n                                        - 22 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nunder those two cases, we conclude the trial court’s error was harmless. “To\n\nconstitute reversible error, a ruling on evidence must be shown not only to\n\nhave been erroneous but harmful to the party complaining.” B & L Asphalt\n\nIndus., Inc. 753 A.2d at 270. “An evidentiary ruling which did not affect\n\nthe verdict will not provide a basis for disturbing the [fact-finder]’s\n\njudgment.” Id. 270-71.\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury that Commodore’s conduct was\n\nrelevant only if the jury deemed it a superseding cause of Mr. Renninger’s\n\naccident. N.T. Trial, 6/25/2015 p.m., at 15; Verdict Slip, Question 3. We\n\npresume that juries follow the trial court’s instructions. Maya v. Johnson\n\nand Johnson, 97 A.3d 1203, 1222 (Pa. Super. 2014), appeal denied, 112\n\nA.3d 653 (Pa. 2015).     Question one on the verdict slip asked the jury\n\nwhether the caster was defective. Question three on the verdict slip asked\n\nthe jury to assess whether Commodore’s or Mr. Renninger’s conduct was a\n\ncause of the accident. The jury answered question one in the negative, and\n\ntherefore left question three blank.   Given the foregoing, we will presume\n\nthat the jury did not consider the evidence of Commodore’s conduct or Mr.\n\nRenninger’s alleged assumption of risk.\n\n     In addition, the record contains a significant body of evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s verdict.   As we have already explained, the jury had\n\nbefore it Appellee’s introduction of ANSI standards governing casters, which\n\nAppellants have not challenged on appeal.    Further, the jury had before it\n\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nAppellee’s evidence that toe guards would not have protected Mr. Renninger,\n\ngiven the uneven flooring in Commodore’s plant. The jury also had before it\n\nAppellee’s evidence that toe guards would pose risks such as severing\n\nelectric cords draped across the floor. Given all of this evidence, and given\n\nthe trial court’s instruction that Commodore’s and Mr. Renninger’s conduct10\n\nwas relevant only to causation, we conclude that any error in admitting\n\nevidence of Commodore’s conduct was harmless.\n\n       We pause here to address the parties’ arguments under Tincher.\n\nAppellants take a very narrow reading of Tincher, seemingly concluding that\n\nit overruled Azzarello but did little else. Even a cursory reading of Tincher\n\nbelies that argument. The Supreme Court’s opinion in Lewis, providing for\n\na strict separation between negligence and strict liability, was, according to\n\nthe Tincher Court, a result in harmony with Azzarello. The Tincher Court,\n\nas we have explained, did not expressly overrule Lewis, and had no\n\noccasion to do so based on the arguments the parties presented to it. The\n\nTincher Court did anticipate that its holding would have significant ripple\n\neffects to be addressed case by case as they arise:\n\n            This Opinion does not purport to either approve or\n       disapprove prior decisional law, or available alternatives\n       suggested by commentators or the Restatements, relating to\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10\n    The parties disputed the admissibility of Mr. Renninger’s alleged\nassumption of risk under Reott v. Asia Trend, Inc., 55 A.3d 1088 (Pa.\n2012) and/or Clark v. Bil-Jax, Inc., 763 A.2d 920 (Pa. Super. 2000),\nappeal denied, 782 A.2d 541 (Pa. 2001).\n\n\n\n                                          - 24 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n     foundational or subsidiary considerations and consequences of\n     our explicit holdings.      In light of our prior discussion, the\n     difficulties that justify our restraint should be readily apparent.\n     The common law regarding these related considerations should\n     develop within the proper factual contexts against the\n     background of targeted advocacy.\n\nTincher, 104 A.3d at 410 (emphasis added).\n\n     Ordinarily, this Court is bound by Supreme Court precedent, as well as\n\nthe published decisions of prior en banc and three-judge panels of this\n\nCourt. In the wake of Tincher, however, the bench and bar must assess\n\nthe Tincher opinion’s implications for a large body of post-Azzarello and\n\npre-Tincher case law.\n\n     In this case, Appellee argues that the Tincher Court’s reliance on\n\nCalifornia case law, particularly Barker v. Lull Engineering Co., 573 P.2d\n\n443 (Ca. 1978) reveals the Supreme Court’s intent to admit evidence of\n\nindustry standards because California does so. Appellee’s Brief at 12-13. In\n\nfact, admission of industry standards evidence is still in controversy in\n\nCalifornia, and the issue is currently pending before the California Supreme\n\nCourt. Kim v. Toyota Motor Corp., 197 Cal. Rptr. 3d (Cal. Ct. App. 2016),\n\nreview granted and opinion superseded, 368 P.3d 311 (Cal. 2016).\n\n     In Kim, the plaintiffs filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence of\n\nindustry custom and practice concerning the design of their 2005 Toyota\n\nTundra pickup truck. Id. at 652. Plaintiffs argued that electronic stability\n\ncontrol (“ESC”) could have prevented their accident.        Toyota’s product\n\nmanager acknowledged that Toyota engineers recommended making ESC\n\n                                   - 25 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nstandard on the 2005 Tundra. Id. at 653. Toyota instead offered it as an\n\noption, noting that no other manufacturer of full-size pickup trucks offered\n\nESC as a standard feature in 2005. Id. The Kim Court noted two lines of\n\nCalifornia case law arriving at different conclusions on the admissibility of\n\nindustry standards evidence, and devised a middle ground approach. Id. at\n\n655-61. The California Supreme Court has yet to render a decision in Kim.\n\n      Kim is illustrative of some of the competing arguments for and against\n\nindustry standards evidence in strict products liability/design defect cases.\n\nOther states, including Illinois, hold that evidence of a product’s compliance\n\nwith industry standards is relevant, but not a complete defense.          See\n\nJablonski v. Ford Motor Co., 955 N.E.2d 1138, 1154 (Ill. 2011). Neither\n\nparty to the instant appeal has offered any substantive argument for or\n\nagainst the admission of such evidence in Pennsylvania after Tincher.\n\nGiven the arguments before us, we do not have occasion to express an\n\nopinion. In light of all of the foregoing, Appellants’ first three arguments do\n\nnot merit relief.\n\n      Appellants’ next three assertions of error address the trial court’s jury\n\ninstruction.\n\n            We will reverse for improper jury instructions only where\n      the trial court committed a clear abuse of discretion or an error\n      of law which controlled the outcome of the case. […] We will\n      not reverse for isolated inaccuracies; the charge as a whole must\n      be shown to have caused prejudicial error. Thus, to constitute\n      reversible error, a jury instruction must be erroneous and\n      harmful to the complaining party.\n\n\n                                    - 26 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nSchaaf v. Kaufman, 850 A.2d 655, 666 n.10 (Pa. Super. 2004) (internal\n\ncitations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Appellants argue that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the\n\nso-called “Dean Wade” factors.11               Dean Wade developed seven factors\n\nrelevant to application of the risk-utility theory of recovery.       The Tincher\n\nCourt referenced the Dean Wade test, noted its limitations, and did not\n\nexpressly adopt it.      Tincher, 104 A.3d at 389-90. As both the trial court\n\nand Appellee note, Appellants failed to object to the jury instruction in\n\nquestion.    Appellants’ do not cite the place of preservation of this issue in\n\naccord with Pa.R.A.P. 2117(c), and our review of the transcript does not\n\nreveal any specific objection to a charge containing the seven Dean Wade\n\nfactors. Appellee’s proposed points for charge number 22 included six of the\n\nDean Wade factors, and when the parties addressed that point the trial court\n\nsimply noted it was covered in the court’s risk utility instruction. N.T. Trial,\n\n6/25/2015 a.m., at 30. The Dean Wade factors were mentioned during the\n\ncolloquy, but it is not clear that Appellants’ objected to a charge containing\n\nthe seven factors. Id. at 29. At the conclusion of its charge, the trial court\n\noffered the parties the opportunity to raise “any matters concerning the\n\ncharge” and Appellants offered nothing.            N.T. 6/25/2015 p.m., at 27.   As\n\nsuch, they have waived this argument. “Objections to jury instructions must\n____________________________________________\n\n\n11\n    Dean John W. Wade was the Dean of Vanderbilt Law School and a widely\ncited expert on tort law.\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nbe made before the jury retires to deliberate, unless the trial court\n\nspecifically allows otherwise.      Pa.R.C.P. [No.] 227(b).”      Passarello v.\n\nGrumbine, 87 A.3d 285, 292 (Pa. 2014).              “[W]here a party fails to\n\nspecifically object to a trial court’s jury instruction, the objection is waived\n\nand cannot subsequently be raised on appeal.” Cruz v. Ne. Hosp., 801 A.2d\n\n602, 610–11 (Pa. Super. 2002) (quoting Randt. v. Abex Corp., 671 A.2d\n\n228, 232 (Pa. Super. 1996)).         Furthermore, Appellants’ brief does not\n\naddress any particular factor or factors and explain how it prejudiced their\n\ncase.\n\n        Next, Appellants argue the sequencing of the trial court’s instructions\n\nwas erroneous because it permitted the jury to reach a decision on product\n\ndefect without considering the risk-utility test.      Once again, the record\n\nreveals that Appellants failed to lodge a timely objection.\n\n        In their sixth assertion of error, Appellants claim the trial court erred\n\nin declining to instruct the jury on the intended-use doctrine.      The parties\n\ndispute whether the intended use doctrine—which holds that a product must\n\nbe safe for its intended use by its intended user—applies after Tincher.\n\nInstantly, there is nothing to suggest that Mr. Renninger’s injury occurred\n\nduring an unintended use of the caster, or that the persons moving the\n\nhome along the plant floor were unintended users.             To the extent they\n\nbelieve the alleged conduct of Commodore and/or Mr. Renninger was offered\n\nas evidence of an unintended use of the caster (see Appellants’ Brief at 14-\n\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n15), we have already explained that the jury never considered that\n\nevidence.       As noted above, Appellants cannot obtain relief unless they\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court’s instruction was erroneous and harmful.\n\nAppellants have not explained how the court’s instruction harmed their case,\n\nand that omission is fatal to this argument.\n\n          Finally, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in entering summary\n\njudgment on Appellants’ failure to warn and manufacturing defect causes of\n\naction.      Appellants’ argument on this point is puzzling, in that Appellants\n\naddress an evidentiary dispute as to which party was responsible for the\n\ndesign of the caster assembly. Appellants’ Brief at 23-24. Appellants fail to\n\nexplain how this evidentiary dispute was relevant to their failure to warn and\n\nmanufacturing defect claims, or precisely why the trial court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment on those claims. This argument does not merit\n\nrelief.\n\n          In summary, we have concluded that none of Appellants’ assertions of\n\nerror merits relief. We therefore affirm the judgment.\n\n          Judgment affirmed.\n\nJudgment Entered.\n\n\n\n\nJoseph D.

Renninger and his wife, Patsy D. Renninger,\n\nappeal from the judgment of November 12, 2015. We affirm.\n\n        On May 25, 2007, Appellant Dennis Renninger was at work in the\n\nClarion,    Pennsylvania      plant    of      his   employer,   Commodore   Homes\n\n(“Commodore”), a manufacturer of modular homes, when he sustained a\n\nserious injury to his foot.       While under construction, each modular home\n\nmoves along an assembly on wheeled casters attached to its underside. Mr.\n\nRenninger was injured when a caster ran over his foot.              Appellants sued\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n*\n    Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nAppellees A&R Machine Shop (“A&R”)1 and Cass Hudson Company (“Cass\n\nHudson”) as the designers, manufacturers and suppliers of the casters.\n\nAppellants alleged causes of action for strict products liability, negligence,\n\nbreach of implied warranty, and loss of consortium causes of action, claiming\n\nthe casters should have included toe guards. The case proceeded to a June\n\n22-25, 2015 jury trial on Appellants’ strict products liability/design defect\n\nclaim.2     The jury returned a defense verdict, finding Cass Hudson did not\n\nsupply a defective product.         Appellants filed timely post-trial motions on\n\nJune 30, 2015. The trial court denied those motions on November 3, 2015.\n\nThe verdict was reduced to judgment on November 12, 2015, and this timely\n\nappeal followed.\n\n       Appellant raises seven assertions of error, which we have reordered\n\nfor clarity of analysis:\n\n       I.     Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in denying [Appellants’] motion for post-trial relief\n              which requested in the alternative either: (1) an order of\n              a judgment notwithstanding the verdict setting aside the\n              jury’s verdict and issuing an award for [Appellants], or (2)\n              ordering a new trial in this matter, where the issuance of\n              such an order was clearly supported by the evidentiary\n              record and controlling case law and the denial of such\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n  Appellants and A&R reached a settlement agreement prior to trial. A&R is\nnot participating in this appeal.\n2\n    The trial court entered summary judgment in Appellees’ favor on\nAppellants’ manufacturing defect and failure to warn products liability causes\nof action.   Appellants withdrew the negligence and breach of implied\nwarranty claims prior to trial.\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n              request deprived [Appellants] of an adequate statutory or\n              legal remedy and was clearly contrary to the applicable\n              case law.\n\n       II.    Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in finding that it properly allowed evidence and\n              testimony of industry standards and employer conduct to\n              be considered by the jury.\n\n       III.   Whether the trial court erred in its April 17, 2015 order on\n              motions in limine where it expressly stated that the\n              Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling in [Tincher3] allowed\n              for the introduction of the following at trial:\n\n              (a)    Industry safety standards;\n              (b)    OSHA safety standards;\n              (c)    Employer conduct; and\n              (d)    Conduct of third parties, including but not limited to\n                     assumption of risk by [Mr. Renninger].\n\n       IV.    Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n              erred in finding that it properly instructed the jury on the\n              question of defective design of a product. Specifically,\n              whether the court erred when it instructed the jury on the\n              factors to consider in applying the risk utility analysis\n              required pursuant to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\n              decision in [Tincher], when it instructed the jury to\n              consider a seven-part test which was not adopted by the\n              [Tincher] decision.\n\n       V.     Whether the trial court erred when it failed to properly\n              craft a jury verdict question and failed to place such jury\n              questions in a sequence that resulted in the jury deciding\n              the case before being asked to apply the risk utility\n              analysis required by [Tincher].           Specifically, jury\n              questions 1 and 2, which were generic questions that did\n              not require the application of the risk utility analysis, and\n              consequently this case was decided without the application\n              of risk utility by the jury.\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n3\n    Tincher v.

Whether in its November 3, 2015 order, the trial court\n             erred in finding that it properly disallowed a jury\n             instruction on the doctrine of intended use in the context\n             of products liability design defect cases pursuant to the\n             Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision in [Tincher].\n\n      VII.   Whether the trial court erred in its January 27, 2011 order\n             on [Appellees’] motions for summary judgment where it\n             misapplied Pa.R.C.P. [No.] 1035.2, in that it relied upon an\n             affidavit to prematurely grant summary judgment in favor\n             of [Appellees] before the close of discovery and dismissed\n             certain counts of [Appellants’] amended complaint; and\n             more importantly used that same affidavit to conclude that\n             the third party/employer was the designer of the subject\n             product, and that neither [Appellee] designed the wheeled\n             caster assemblies at issue.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 4-6.\n\n      Before we analyze Appellants’ legal arguments, we will review the\n\nfacts introduced at trial.   Mr. Renninger’s job at Commodore was to help\n\nbuild and finish roofs. N.T Trial, 6/22/15, at 60. Mr. Renninger’s plant built\n\nroughly ten to twelve homes at one time. N.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 21. The\n\nhomes under construction moved around the assembly line on casters bolted\n\nto their undersides.   Id. at 22, 24. Originally, Commodore positioned the\n\ncasters several feet inside of the home’s outer frame, such that a moving\n\ncaster could not run over the foot of a person standing alongside a moving\n\nhome. Id. at 22-23, 92, 114-15; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 96. Commodore\n\nrepositioned the casters to the outer edge of the homes to prevent bowing in\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nthe floor joists.4     Id.; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 58.     Commodore modified\n\ntwenty casters to accommodate the new location. R 796-802. Cass Hudson\n\nand A&R Machine subsequently supplied additional casters fabricated to\n\nmeet the new specifications. Id. The twenty modified casters remained in\n\nuse at the time of Mr. Renninger’s accident, and it was not possible to\n\ndistinguish the casters Commodore modified from the unmodified casters\n\nsubsequently supplied by Cass Hudson. Id.\n\n         Mr. Renninger’s accident occurred while he was on the plant floor\n\nspeaking to his foreman.          N.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 26-28.   Mr. Renninger\n\ntestified that Commodore never trained its employees on Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) regulations regarding the plant\n\nfloor.    Id. at 85.    Mr. Renninger was not aware of any OSHA regulation\n\nrequiring the use of steel-toed boots on the plant floor, and he did not own\n\nsteel-toed boots on the date of the accident. Id. at 83-85. He was wearing\n\ntennis shoes when the accident occurred, and he was aware that the casters\n\ndid not have a guard to prevent the wheel from running over a foot. Id. at\n\n80. Mr. Renninger also testified that the plant floor was not level, such that\n\nsome of the wheels underneath a moving modular home would touch the\n\nground while others did not.         Id. at 85-86.   Mr. Renninger believed a toe\n____________________________________________\n\n\n4\n   The record indicates that Commodore switched from mobile to modular\nhomes the year before Mr. Renninger’s accident. The interior placement of\nthe casters worked for mobile homes but caused bowing in the floors of the\nmodular homes.\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nguard on the caster would have prevented his injury.      Id. at 96-97.   Mr.\n\nRenninger did not believe a steel-toed boot would have prevented his injury.\n\nId. at 97.\n\n       Richard Guzicki an employee of Appellee Cass Hudson who helped\n\nhandle the Commodore account, testified that Cass Hudson is a distributor of\n\ncasters and wheels. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 5. Cass Hudson consults with its\n\ncustomers to determine an appropriate caster for their needs. Id. at 5, 17.\n\nDale Toney, director of special operations for Commodore, testified that he\n\nrelied on Guzicki to supply an appropriate wheel for the height and weight.\n\nId. at 80, 83, 110.        According to Guzicki, Cass Hudson does not advise\n\ncustomers on the need for toe guards in a given application, and does not\n\nanalyze the safety needs at a customer’s plant.      Id. at 43-45.   Likewise,\n\nCass Hudson personnel did not visit the plant where the accident occurred.\n\nId. at 47. Thus, Cass Hudson had no opportunity to observe the condition\n\nof the plant floor.5\n\n       Delbert Miller, one of the owners of A&R Machine Shop (“A&R”),\n\ntestified that A&R fabricated the brackets that held the casters to the\n\nmodular homes. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 57. Cass Hudson is one of A&R’s\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n5\n    We observe that the plant closed shortly after the accident. Cass\nHudson’s legal team never had an opportunity to examine the plant, the\nfloor, or the caster that caused the injury.\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nlargest customers. Id. at 67-68. Like Guzicki, Miller never visited the plant\n\nwhere the accident occurred. Id. at 69.\n\n      Both parties produced expert witnesses.      Paul Dreyer, a mechanical\n\nengineer and Appellants’ expert witness, described the roles of Commodore,\n\nCass Hudson, and A&R:\n\n             Okay. Commodore is the manufacturer of the modular\n      homes, so they know modular homes. A&R Machine is basically\n      a machine shop that builds metal fabricated parts, things that\n      drill holes and a certain size and shape. They supplied a metal\n      fabric part which they called a bracket to Cass Hudson. And\n      Cass Hudson took the bracket and mounted it to the caster\n      assembly and then supplied it directly to Commodore to be used\n      underneath the modular home.\n\nN.T. Trial, 6/23/15, at 114. Dreyer testified that the casters attached to the\n\nouter edge of the modular homes were defective because they lacked a toe\n\nguard. Id. at 117.\n\n            [T]he main reason why a toe guard is important for this\n      particular application is because this is a very large wheel with a\n      very heavy load. That can be very dangerous. And because of\n      that circumstance, it needed to be—the workers needed to be\n      protected from the possible movement of that very heavy load\n      onto their foot.\n\nId. at 117-18.\n\n      Further:\n\n            For this particular caster assembly to have, like I\n      mentioned, a large wheel which has no guarding, no protection,\n      which is—could instill a very serious injury on a worker who is\n      paying attention to his job and not thinking that there’s an\n      imminent hazard, imminent danger right below him until\n      obviously after it occurred. And if this caster had a guard\n      assembly, a toe guard assembly, it might have pinched his foot\n      but pushed it out of the way so it wouldn’t be ridden completely\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n     over and partially—according to the documents, partially up his\n     ankle before they could get it off of his foot and cause that\n     serious injury.\n\nId. at 120.   In Dreyer’s opinion, the toe guard was preferable to using\n\nanother worker as a spotter, and it was also preferable to using a buzzer or\n\nbeeper on a moving modular home.       Id. at 121.   A spotter may not see\n\neverything, and a buzzer might not get the attention of a worker wearing ear\n\nprotection. Id. Multiple homes moving along the assembly line and beeping\n\ncould cause confusion. Id.\n\n     Dreyer stated that Cass Hudson’s suppliers offer toe guards for sale in\n\ntheir catalogues, but he acknowledged that a toe guard for the casters\n\nCommodore purchased would have needed to be custom designed.          Id. at\n\n118. A custom designed toe guard would have increased the cost of each\n\ncaster by 10 to 12 percent. Id. at 123-25. Dreyer said it should have been\n\nobvious to Cass Hudson that a toe guard was necessary, once the casters\n\nwere moved to the outer edge of the modular homes. Id. at 206.\n\n     Dreyer believed the use of a toe guard would have been in accord with\n\nindustry standards. “The caster industry has done that analysis and come\n\nup with a couple of different toe guard designs, and I have my faith in their\n\nindustry that that design minimizes injury.”    Id. at 161.    Commodore’s\n\ncompliance, or lack thereof, with OSHA regulations was not relevant to\n\nDreyer’s analysis of the product design. Id. at 201, 209.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n      The defense expert, Gary Hutter, testified that no industry standard\n\nrequires heavy-duty casters to have toe guards. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 167-\n\n68.\n\n            Q.    Is that a standard that exists in the wheel supply\n      industry?\n\n            A.    No, it is not. It’s not a standard in the wheel supply\n      industry, nor is it a requirement by OSHA. I’m on an ANSI\n      [American National Standards Institute] committee that’s\n      involved with casters. I voted on two of their standards. It’s not\n      a requirement in those standards either.\n\n            Q.    Do you know of any law, any regulation, any\n      standard or any literature that coincides with Mr. Dreyer’s\n      opinion that all heavy-duty casters must contain guards?\n\n            A.    No, I’m not aware of anything like that.\n\n            Q.    Have you ever heard any person or any expert offer\n      that opinion at any other time than in this case?\n\n            A.    No, I have not.\n\n            Q.    Can you tell us what the standard is with regard to a\n      reasonable seller of a caster dolly and wheels such as that we’re\n      dealing with here?\n\n            A.     Well, in essence, the caster dolly is a component in a\n      product, the product being the—this house that’s being made,\n      and it’s a component someone’s buying—\n\n            [At this point, Appellants’ Counsel successfully objected to\n      Hutter’s characterization of the caster as a component of the\n      modular home]\n\n            Q.   Setting aside components, what is the—what is the\n      standard of what a reasonable seller is expected to comply with\n      when they are selling a caster dolly as was sold in this particular\n      case.\n\n           A.    In essence, that it would be compliant with codes\n      and standards, that it would be reasonably safe, that it would\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       perform the utility as they understood the utility to be, those\n       kinds of things.\n\n            Q.    And in this particular case, is it your opinion that\n       Cass Hudson complied with the standard—the applicable\n       standard that you just indicated or that it did not comply?\n\n              A.     Yes, that it did.[6]\n\nId. at 169-71.\n\n       Hutter further elaborated on the ANSI standards:\n\n              Now, wheels have been around for a long time; and most\n       of the wheels we encounter do not have any kind of wheel\n       bearings on them. Now, in some situations, maybe a wheel\n       bearing makes sense; but let’s see if the codes and standards\n       require wheel bearings. When I went to the ANSI code—and\n       ANSI is American National Standards Institute. They have codes\n       on casters and wheels. I voted on their standards on those\n       issues. They do not require that wheel guard or any wheel\n       guard is mandatory on—on this kind of product. You go to the\n       codes and standards and you look. Well, what do we need? And\n       I’ve said this repeatedly. You have a trained person. You have\n       spotters. You—you have safety shoes. You make sure the area\n       is clean. In addition, you might use a horn. You might use a\n       light. You might use other kinds of communication. You make\n       sure that there isn’t going to be a problem because this would be\n       like driving a heavy forklift truck and not being able to see\n       what’s in front of you.\n\nId. at 226.     As we will explain below, Appellants have not developed any\n\nargument challenging Hutter’s testimony that Appellee’s casters met\n\nindustry and ANSI standards.\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n  Given this testimony, Appellee’s assertion that it introduced no evidence of\nindustry standards is incorrect. See Appellee’s Brief at 11.\n\n\n\n                                            - 10 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n       Hutter confirmed that Cass Hudson was not in the fabrication business\n\nand could not have fabricated a toe guard for Commodore’s casters. Id. at\n\n174. It would have been impossible to design an appropriate guard without\n\nknowing the contours of the floor:\n\n              Well, first of all, there’s been some discussion about the\n       undulation of the floor of the building where this is being\n       manufactured; and if you have a guard and then try to—I\n       believe Mr. Toney […] wanted it to be close to the floor obviously\n       so that a toe or foot can’t get underneath there; but because the\n       floor goes up and down—which normally a floor would because it\n       would have drains in it, because concrete is never made\n       perfectly flat, because there are expansion joints and all those\n       kinds of things, that if he put it too close to the floor, it would be\n       a problem. And it would gouge into the floor. And if he put it,\n       obviously, too high, it’s not going to protect too many people\n       unless they have a very big shoe on or something like that. So\n       you’d have to know that information about the floor.\n\nId. at 175\n\n       Hutter believed Cass Hudson did not have the information it needed to\n\nmake a safety recommendation, and was not aware that spotters and safety\n\nshoes were not in use, as its personnel never visited the plant. Id. at 212,\n\n219.   Hutter also stated that toe guards present their own risk of injury,\n\nincluding running over electric cords or hoses.      Id. at 182. Hutter opined\n\nthat toe guards did not pass his risk-utility analysis because they would not\n\nnecessarily protect a worker’s foot and they pose additional hazards. Id. at\n\n196-97, 224-25.      Hutter would not have recommended the use of a toe\n\nguard on the casters in question. Id. at 213. Hutter did not believe it was\n\ncertain that a toe guard would have prevented Mr. Renninger’s accident. Id.\n\n\n\n                                      - 11 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nat 191, 196.          Mr. Renninger’s soft tennis shoes could have slipped\n\nunderneath a toe guard, depending on where he stood and the gap between\n\nthe toe guard and the floor at that location. Id. at 196.\n\n        Hutter testified that utility carts used to carry thousands of pounds of\n\nsteel, concrete, or brick generally do not have toe guards on the wheels. Id.\n\nat 187. Similarly, the industrial carts at retailers such as Home Depot do not\n\nhave toe guards. Id. at 188. Hutter claimed the use of a spotter and safety\n\nshoes are the most successful methods of preventing the injury Mr.\n\nRenninger sustained.      Id. at 192-93, 201-02.        The toe of a typical safety\n\nshoe rises two inches above the sole, such that a caster would be unlikely to\n\nroll over the wearer’s foot. Id. at 208. The wheel would bump the safety\n\nshoe and the wearer would have time to move his foot clear of the wheel’s\n\npath.    Id. at 208-09.         Persons operating the machine that pushes the\n\nmodular home are required to comply with government safety standards.\n\nId. at 194. In sum, Hutter did not believe Cass Hudson supplied defective\n\ncasters. Id. at 198. Hutter believed an unsafe workplace, rather than the\n\nlack of a toe guard, caused Mr. Renninger’s injury. Id. at 198-99.\n\n        We now turn to Appellants’ legal arguments. Appellants argue the trial\n\ncourt    erred   in   denying    their   motion   for   a   new   trial   or   judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict (“JNOV”). “Our standard of review regarding a\n\ntrial court’s denial of a motion for a new trial is limited.

The following governs our review of the trial court’s\n\ndenial of JNOV:\n\n           JNOV is the proper remedy in a civil case where the\n     evidence presented at trial was insufficient to sustain the verdict.\n     Nonetheless, JNOV is an extreme remedy which is properly\n     entered by the trial court only in a case where, after viewing the\n     evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, the\n     facts are so clear that no two reasonable minds could fail to\n     agree that the verdict, as rendered by the jury, was improper.\n     JNOV, however, may not be employed to invade the province of\n     the jury. Thus, when there is a question of fact to be resolved, it\n     is within the sole purview of the jury. JNOV should not be\n     entered where evidence is conflicting upon a material fact.\n     Thus, where the jury has been presented with conflicting\n     evidence, a motion for JNOV should be denied.\n\nRohm & Haas Co. v.

Under Azzarello, the trial court decided, as a\n\nmatter of social policy, whether a product was unreasonably dangerous,\n\nwithin the meaning of § 402A. Id. at 367. If the trial court found a product\n\nunreasonably dangerous, it submitted the case to a jury, which then\n\ndetermined whether plaintiffs proved the allegations in their complaint by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. Id. The Tincher Court noted: “[f]ollowing\n\nAzzarello, decisional focus in strict liability cases shifted to reflect an\n\nincreasing concern with segregating strict liability and negligence concepts.”\n\nId.   The Tincher Court went on to discuss Lewis in detail, but it did not\n\nexpressly overrule Lewis, or any case other than Azzarello.          See id. at\n\n368-69. The Supreme Court wrote:\n\n            We recognize—and the bench and bar should recognize—\n      that the decision to overrule Azzarello and articulate a standard\n      of proof premised upon alternative tests in relation to claims of a\n      product defective in design may have an impact upon other\n      foundational issues regarding manufacturing or warning claims,\n      and upon subsidiary issues constructed from Azzarello, such as\n      the availability of negligence-derived defenses, bystander\n      compensation, or the proper application of the intended use\n\n                                     - 15 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n      doctrine. These considerations and effects are outside the scope\n      of the facts of this dispute[.]\n\nId. at 409 (emphasis added).\n\n      Ultimately, the Tincher Court held that a plaintiff may show a\n\ndefective condition by showing either that “(1) the danger is unknowable\n\nand unacceptable to the average or ordinary consumer, or that (2) a\n\nreasonable person would conclude that the probability and seriousness of\n\nharm caused by the product outweigh the burden or costs of taking\n\nprecautions.”    Id. at 335.    These tests present issues of fact for a jury,\n\nexcept where it is clear that reasonable minds cannot differ on an issue. Id.\n\n      Presently at issue in this design defect case is the second of these\n\ntests, known as the risk-utility test.    Throughout its Tincher opinion, the\n\nSupreme Court noted that the risk-utility test is derived from negligence\n\nprinciples.     Specifically, the Court quoted then-Justice Saylor:                “In\n\napplication to design defect claims, the concurrence […] observed, courts in\n\nPennsylvania recognized ‘an integral role for risk-utility (or cost-benefit)\n\nbalancing, derived from negligence theory.’” Id. at 371 (quoting Phillips v.\n\nCricket   Lighters,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1967435\"><a href=\"/opinion/1967435/phillips-v-cricket-lighters/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">      (Pa.   2003)   (OAJC)   (Saylor,    J.\n\nconcurring)); see also id. at 373-74 (quoting Bugosh v.

Justice Saylor opined that a higher threshold of fault is\n\nappropriate in design defect cases, where a plaintiff’s verdict suggests that\n\nan entire product line is defective.     Id.    Further, the Court noted that the\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nLewis Court’s distinction between negligence and strict liability principles\n\nwas in “harmony” with Azzarello. Id. at 368.\n\n       Despite the Supreme Court’s apparent recognition that the effects of\n\nTincher would be far reaching, and despite its analysis of the negligence\n\nunderpinnings of the risk-utility test Appellants rely upon in this case,\n\nAppellants largely sidestep the issue: “Nowhere in the Tincher decision did\n\nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court allow for the consideration of negligence\n\nprinciples in products liability cases.” Appellants’ Brief at 13. Appellants cite\n\npages 399 and 410 of Tincher as evidence that the Supreme Court\n\n“specifically refused to adopt a theory of products liability which included\n\nnegligence theory and principles.” Id. at 15. On page 399 of Tincher, the\n\ncourt recognized the limits of Dean Wade’s seven-part analysis, and\n\nrecognizes the shortcomings of the risk-utility test.    Tincher, 104 A.3d at\n\n399.   Nowhere does the Court state that negligence principles will not be\n\nrelevant in a case where a plaintiff relies on risk-utility to establish a\n\ndefective product. Likewise, on page 410, the Tincher Court explains some\n\nof its reasons for declining to adopt the Third Restatement.        Id. at 410.\n\nNothing on page 410 supports a conclusion that the Tincher Court intended\n\nto maintain a strict division between negligence and strict liability principles\n\nin the risk-utility test.   Indeed, on the prior page (quoted above with\n\nemphasis added) the Supreme Court recognized that its holding could have\n\n\n\n\n                                     - 17 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nan impact on, among other things, the availability of negligence-based\n\ndefenses. Id. at 409.\n\n       With this background, we now turn to the specifics of Appellants’\n\nargument.     Appellants’ filed a pretrial motion in limine seeking to exclude\n\nevidence of industry standards applicable to casters of the type at issue in\n\nthis case and OSHA standards applicable to the Commodore plant where Mr.\n\nRenninger worked.         The trial court denied the motion, reasoning that\n\n“[industry] standards may supply the jury with a useful starting point from\n\nwhich to evaluate the caster’s design.” Trial Court Opinion, 4/17/2015, at\n\n21.8   As described above, Appellee introduced evidence of ANSI standards\n\ngoverning casters.       Hutter testified that no industry standard required the\n\nuse of toe guards on casters.

It’s not a\n            dispositive, but it’s relevant as to whether or not a seller\n            acted reasonably.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL: Compliance with industry standards,\n            you were talking about industry standards with regard to\n            workplace not with regard to the product.\n\n       APPELLEE’S COUNSEL: No. We talked about it with regard to\n            the product too. It doesn’t violate any industry standards.\n            That was pretty clearly said by Dr. Hutter.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL: No.\n\n       APPELLEE’S COUNSEL: No, it wasn’t.\n\n       APPELLANTS’ COUNSEL:               He   covered   employer   employer\n            employer.\n\nN.T.

Appellants’ Brief\n\nat 12, 21. First, at pages 178 through 181 of the June 24, 2015 transcript,\n\nHutter discussed the lack of safety shoes, trained industrial truck operators,\n\nand spotters, the uneven floor, and other potential hazards at the\n\nCommodore plant. N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 178-81. Hutter also explained his\n\nreasons for opining that a toe guard would not necessarily prevent the type\n\nof injury Mr. Renninger sustained. Id.\n\n      Next, Appellants cite pages 191 to 196 of the June 24, 2015 transcript.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 12, 21. On these pages, Hutter further elaborated on his\n\nreasons for believing a toe guard would not necessarily prevent a foot injury.\n\nN.T Trial, 6/24/15, at 191-92, 195-96. Likewise, Hutter further elaborated\n\non his opinion that Commodore failed to provide proper supervision and\n\nfootwear. Id. at 193. Hutter stated that Commodore was cited for an OSHA\n\nviolation as a result of these deficiencies. Id. at 193-195.\n\n      Finally, Appellants cite pages 198-99 of the June 24, 2015 transcript,\n\nwherein Hutter testified that Mr. Renninger’s injury was a result of\n\nCommodore’s     OSHA    violations   and   Mr.   Renninger’s   own   negligence.\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 12, 21; N.T. Trial, 6/24/15, at 198-99. As noted above,\n\nin none of these portions of the transcript did Hutter reference industry\n\nstandards applicable to casters.\n\n\n\n\n                                      - 20 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n     Appellants rely in part on Sheehan v.

In\n\nSheehan, as in the instant case, the defendant argued that the plaintiff’s\n\nemployer’s OSHA violations were relevant to causation. The defendant sold\n\na shear to the plaintiff’s employer and argued that OSHA regulations\n\nrequired the employer to provide safety guards for use with the shear. Id.\n\nat 1354. We rejected the defendant’s argument:\n\n           Although Shaper attempts to couch its argument in terms\n     of causation, it fails to explain how OSHA standards are relevant\n     to that issue. The essence of Shaper’s argument is that Shaper\n     acted reasonably by designing the shear without a safety guard\n     since OSHA standards place the responsibility of providing a\n     safety guard on the buyer/employer.\n\n                                   [***]\n\n           We conclude that the OSHA regulations proffered would\n     introduce into a strict liability action the reasonableness of\n     Shaper’s failure to provide the new safety device for this\n     machine, an issue irrelevant to whether liability attaches.\n     Accordingly, the trial court did not err by sustaining Sheehan's\n     objections to the introduction of this evidence.\n\nId. at 1354-55. Thus, the Sheehan Court employed the strict separation\n\nbetween negligence and strict liability, set forth in Lewis in “harmony” with\n\nAzzarello.    See Tincher, 104 A.3d at 368 (discussing Lewis and\n\nAzzarello).\n\n     Likewise, Appellants cite Majdic v. Cincinnati Mach.

There, the defendant provided a press\n\nbrake, which plaintiff’s employer then incorporated into its manufacturing\n\nsystem.     Id. at 336-37.    Plaintiff alleged the press brake was defective\n\nbecause “it did not contain a guard which would have prevented the\n\noperator’s hands from entering the point of operation.”            Id. at 336.   The\n\ndefendant    argued   that    “the    press      brake   was   a   general   purpose,\n\nmultifunctional unit which was unequipped with dies and had no point of\n\noperation when sold.” Id. at 337. Thus, “only [plaintiff’s employer], which\n\nincorporated the press brake into its manufacturing system, could determine\n\nand install the guards and warnings necessary for the particular function\n\nassigned to the press.”      Id.     The defendant introduced evidence of ANSI\n\nstandards for power presses and evidence that it was industry custom for\n\nthe purchaser of a press brake to provide the necessary safety devices. Id.\n\nat 338.    Citing Lewis, decided the year before Majdic, the Majdic Court\n\nheld that the trial court erred in permitting the ANSI evidence and evidence\n\nof industry custom.     Id. at 338-39.           The Majdic Court rejected such\n\nevidence because it implicated the reasonableness of the manufacturer’s\n\nconduct.\n\n     Appellants do not address whether Tincher has any implications for\n\nthe continued vitality of Sheehan or Majdic.             Assuming without deciding\n\nthat the trial court erred in admitting evidence of Commodore’s conduct\n\n\n                                        - 22 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nunder those two cases, we conclude the trial court’s error was harmless. “To\n\nconstitute reversible error, a ruling on evidence must be shown not only to\n\nhave been erroneous but harmful to the party complaining.” B & L Asphalt\n\nIndus., Inc. 753 A.2d at 270. “An evidentiary ruling which did not affect\n\nthe verdict will not provide a basis for disturbing the [fact-finder]’s\n\njudgment.” Id. 270-71.\n\n     The trial court instructed the jury that Commodore’s conduct was\n\nrelevant only if the jury deemed it a superseding cause of Mr. Renninger’s\n\naccident. N.T. Trial, 6/25/2015 p.m., at 15; Verdict Slip, Question 3. We\n\npresume that juries follow the trial court’s instructions. Maya v. Johnson\n\nand Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1222 (Pa.

Question one on the verdict slip asked the jury\n\nwhether the caster was defective. Question three on the verdict slip asked\n\nthe jury to assess whether Commodore’s or Mr. Renninger’s conduct was a\n\ncause of the accident. The jury answered question one in the negative, and\n\ntherefore left question three blank.   Given the foregoing, we will presume\n\nthat the jury did not consider the evidence of Commodore’s conduct or Mr.\n\nRenninger’s alleged assumption of risk.\n\n     In addition, the record contains a significant body of evidence\n\nsupporting the jury’s verdict.   As we have already explained, the jury had\n\nbefore it Appellee’s introduction of ANSI standards governing casters, which\n\nAppellants have not challenged on appeal.    Further, the jury had before it\n\n\n                                    - 23 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nAppellee’s evidence that toe guards would not have protected Mr. Renninger,\n\ngiven the uneven flooring in Commodore’s plant. The jury also had before it\n\nAppellee’s evidence that toe guards would pose risks such as severing\n\nelectric cords draped across the floor. Given all of this evidence, and given\n\nthe trial court’s instruction that Commodore’s and Mr. Renninger’s conduct10\n\nwas relevant only to causation, we conclude that any error in admitting\n\nevidence of Commodore’s conduct was harmless.\n\n       We pause here to address the parties’ arguments under Tincher.\n\nAppellants take a very narrow reading of Tincher, seemingly concluding that\n\nit overruled Azzarello but did little else. Even a cursory reading of Tincher\n\nbelies that argument. The Supreme Court’s opinion in Lewis, providing for\n\na strict separation between negligence and strict liability, was, according to\n\nthe Tincher Court, a result in harmony with Azzarello. The Tincher Court,\n\nas we have explained, did not expressly overrule Lewis, and had no\n\noccasion to do so based on the arguments the parties presented to it. The\n\nTincher Court did anticipate that its holding would have significant ripple\n\neffects to be addressed case by case as they arise:\n\n            This Opinion does not purport to either approve or\n       disapprove prior decisional law, or available alternatives\n       suggested by commentators or the Restatements, relating to\n____________________________________________\n\n\n10\n    The parties disputed the admissibility of Mr. Renninger’s alleged\nassumption of risk under Reott v.

Appellee’s Brief at 12-13. In\n\nfact, admission of industry standards evidence is still in controversy in\n\nCalifornia, and the issue is currently pending before the California Supreme\n\nCourt. Kim v. Toyota Motor Corp., 197 Cal. Rptr. 3d (Cal. Ct. App. 2016),\n\nreview granted and opinion superseded, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 2016).\n\n     In Kim, the plaintiffs filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence of\n\nindustry custom and practice concerning the design of their 2005 Toyota\n\nTundra pickup truck. Id. at 652. Plaintiffs argued that electronic stability\n\ncontrol (“ESC”) could have prevented their accident.        Toyota’s product\n\nmanager acknowledged that Toyota engineers recommended making ESC\n\n                                   - 25 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\nstandard on the 2005 Tundra. Id. at 653. Toyota instead offered it as an\n\noption, noting that no other manufacturer of full-size pickup trucks offered\n\nESC as a standard feature in 2005. Id. The Kim Court noted two lines of\n\nCalifornia case law arriving at different conclusions on the admissibility of\n\nindustry standards evidence, and devised a middle ground approach. Id. at\n\n655-61. The California Supreme Court has yet to render a decision in Kim.\n\n      Kim is illustrative of some of the competing arguments for and against\n\nindustry standards evidence in strict products liability/design defect cases.\n\nOther states, including Illinois, hold that evidence of a product’s compliance\n\nwith industry standards is relevant, but not a complete defense.

Neither\n\nparty to the instant appeal has offered any substantive argument for or\n\nagainst the admission of such evidence in Pennsylvania after Tincher.\n\nGiven the arguments before us, we do not have occasion to express an\n\nopinion. In light of all of the foregoing, Appellants’ first three arguments do\n\nnot merit relief.\n\n      Appellants’ next three assertions of error address the trial court’s jury\n\ninstruction.\n\n            We will reverse for improper jury instructions only where\n      the trial court committed a clear abuse of discretion or an error\n      of law which controlled the outcome of the case.

The Tincher\n\nCourt referenced the Dean Wade test, noted its limitations, and did not\n\nexpressly adopt it.      Tincher, 104 A.3d at 389-90. As both the trial court\n\nand Appellee note, Appellants failed to object to the jury instruction in\n\nquestion.    Appellants’ do not cite the place of preservation of this issue in\n\naccord with Pa.R.A.P. 2117(c), and our review of the transcript does not\n\nreveal any specific objection to a charge containing the seven Dean Wade\n\nfactors. Appellee’s proposed points for charge number 22 included six of the\n\nDean Wade factors, and when the parties addressed that point the trial court\n\nsimply noted it was covered in the court’s risk utility instruction.

Furthermore, Appellants’ brief does not\n\naddress any particular factor or factors and explain how it prejudiced their\n\ncase.\n\n        Next, Appellants argue the sequencing of the trial court’s instructions\n\nwas erroneous because it permitted the jury to reach a decision on product\n\ndefect without considering the risk-utility test.      Once again, the record\n\nreveals that Appellants failed to lodge a timely objection.\n\n        In their sixth assertion of error, Appellants claim the trial court erred\n\nin declining to instruct the jury on the intended-use doctrine.      The parties\n\ndispute whether the intended use doctrine—which holds that a product must\n\nbe safe for its intended use by its intended user—applies after Tincher.\n\nInstantly, there is nothing to suggest that Mr. Renninger’s injury occurred\n\nduring an unintended use of the caster, or that the persons moving the\n\nhome along the plant floor were unintended users.             To the extent they\n\nbelieve the alleged conduct of Commodore and/or Mr. Renninger was offered\n\nas evidence of an unintended use of the caster (see Appellants’ Brief at 14-\n\n\n                                      - 28 -\n\fJ-A23029-16\n\n\n15), we have already explained that the jury never considered that\n\nevidence.       As noted above, Appellants cannot obtain relief unless they\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court’s instruction was erroneous and harmful.\n\nAppellants have not explained how the court’s instruction harmed their case,\n\nand that omission is fatal to this argument.\n\n          Finally, Appellants argue that the trial court erred in entering summary\n\njudgment on Appellants’ failure to warn and manufacturing defect causes of\n\naction.      Appellants’ argument on this point is puzzling, in that Appellants\n\naddress an evidentiary dispute as to which party was responsible for the\n\ndesign of the caster assembly. Appellants’ Brief at 23-24. Appellants fail to\n\nexplain how this evidentiary dispute was relevant to their failure to warn and\n\nmanufacturing defect claims, or precisely why the trial court erred in\n\nentering summary judgment on those claims. This argument does not merit\n\nrelief.\n\n          In summary, we have concluded that none of Appellants’ assertions of\n\nerror merits relief.
