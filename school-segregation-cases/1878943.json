The plaintiffs seek a declaration and injunction against the execution and putting into effect of certain urban redevelopment plans of the City of Gadsden, Alabama, attacked upon the ground that they foster enforced racial segregation. The district court entered judgment in favor of defendants pursuant to findings of fact and conclusions of law, now reported in 174 F.Supp. 64, with which all of the members of this Court were tentatively in agreement in our first conference following the argument and submission of this appeal. After further study and more mature deliberation, Judges Cameron and Jones adhere to that view while the writer concurs in part and dissents in part for reasons separately stated. The judgment is therefore</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIVES, Circuit Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A careful study of the record and exhibits has convinced me that there are controlling additional facts, themselves either undisputed or conclusively established, which were not noted in the district court's findings of fact. Recognizing the importance of this litigation to the public, as well as to the litigants, I have set forth those facts at considerable length in an appendix to this opinion. Excluding those items of doubtful value or of questionable admissibility, but otherwise carefully considering the entire record, I cannot escape the conclusion that <i>actual</i> segregation is contemplated. So long as that is voluntary, rather than governmentally enforced, there can be no constitutional objection. As we said in Cohen v. Public Housing Administration, 5 Cir., 1958, 257 F.2d 73, 78:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Mr. Stillwell's testimony has been noted (footnote 7, supra) to the effect that in his opinion actual segregation is essential to the success of a program of public housing in Savannah. If the people involved think that such is the case and if Negroes and whites desire to maintain voluntary segregation for their common good, there is certainly no law to prevent such cooperation. Neither the Fifth nor the Fourteenth Amendment operates positively to command integration of the races but only negatively to forbid governmentally enforced segregation.<sup>11</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"11. Cf. Avery v. Wichita Falls Independent School District, 5 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 230, 233; Rippy v. Borders, 5 Cir., 1957, 250 F.2d 690, 692.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That governmentally enforced segregation in housing is unconstitutional has now been settled beyond controversy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The cases just cited in footnote 1 make clear that a State agency has no constitutional power to oust persons of one race from their homes and thereafter forcibly to restrict the land to the exclusive occupancy of persons of another race. Ultimately then, the issue on its merits must turn upon whether the contemplated actual segregation is to be voluntary or governmentally enforced. At the present stage the plaintiffs and the defendants face real, though different, dilemmas in reaching that issue. The plaintiffs feel that they cannot wait longer. As their attorney stated to the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Mr. Burns: That is the very reason why we have to do this now.

Stuyvesant Town Corp., 299 N.Y. 512, 87 N.E.2d 541, 14 A.L.R.2d 133, certiorari denied 339 U.S. 981, 70 S.Ct. 1019, 94 L.Ed. 1385, and that if they purchase homes in the North Fifth Street Area they will be racially segregated in that area, and, therefore, they should be delivered from the apprehension of this possible dilemma by injunctive relief, preventing the carrying out of the plans which, they insist, constitute a scheme and design for initiating, enforcing, extending and perpetuating racial segregation in residential areas of Gadsden in violation of their constitutional rights. Otherwise, they see no escape from their anticipated predicament once the properties are sold to private interests; and they are fearful in that event that their last state will become worse than their first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>* * * * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If the Court assumes that private interests will restrict sales in the Birmingham Street Area to white people and the North Fifth Street Area to colored people, such sales would not be actions under color, authority, or constraint of state law, nor would they be the performances of functions of a governmental character. Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corp., supra, Johnson v. Levitt &amp; Sons, Inc., D.C.E.D.Pa., 131 F.Supp. 114.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants, on their part, stoutly deny that any enforced segregation is contemplated. Their brief states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In this case no one is compelled to occupy the new houses to be constructed, and no one is prohibited from purchasing such houses; anyone buying any of the property will have to buy it with full knowledge that there can be no discrimination in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>* * * * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The court should assume that the defendants, their agents and successors in office, after receiving the federal assistance in this public project, will, upon completion of this project, or in carrying it out, recognize the law to the effect there can be no governmentally enforced segregation solely because of race or color. Tate v. City of Eufaula [Alabama, D.C.], 165 F.Supp. 303.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants point out that the plaintiffs may not, when the time comes, want to move back into either of the Areas:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"* * * it boils down to the question of whether a complaint based on plaintiffs' alleged fears that they may not be able to repurchase land in the redeveloped area states a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. It is obvious that such redevelopment cannot be accomplished in a short period of time. It is equally obvious that not only plaintiffs but all occupants of the North Fifth Street area and the Birmingham Street area must be moved and relocated pending such clearance. It is by no means clear that plaintiffs or any of the occupants of these areas will even want to move back into such areas after redevelopment. Yet these plaintiffs are insisting that the entire slum clearance project be stopped on such a complaint.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that the serious injury which the public may suffer from the stoppage of the slum clearance projects, and the desire to afford every opportunity for the voluntary cooperation of the members of all races for their common welfare and betterment are potent factors tending to cause the Court to exercise its discretion to deny an injunction at the present stage of development of the plans. As said by Judge Sibley, speaking for this Court in Kelliher v. Stone &amp; Webster, 5 Cir., 1935, 75 F.2d 331, 333, 334:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"* * * and when a public improvement is sought to be stopped, the inconvenience to the public, as weighed against a slight or remediable wrong to the plaintiff, may determine the court of equity against this discretionary remedy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The injury which the plaintiffs anticipate, namely, that they may be forced to dispose of their homes for an unconstitutional purpose, cannot be called slight. Rather, the questions are whether the plaintiffs will suffer a legal wrong and whether, at the present stage, their plight is irremediable. If irreparable injury to the plaintiffs will ensue, and if such injury cannot be otherwise prevented, then a suit for injunction restraining the carrying out of the plans is appropriate to present the question of a proposed unlawful exercise of the power of eminent domain for the purpose of subjecting the property taken to a racially discriminatory and unconstitutional use.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"Controls on Redevelopment,\" including the requirement of an anti-racial covenant, go a long way to protect the plaintiffs from governmentally enforced segregation. They do not, however, afford adequate protection if the redeveloper is free to restrict sales in the Birmingham Street Area to white people and in the North Fifth Street Area to Negroes. Enforced segregation might well be the practical result, whether or not so intended by the defendants. The plaintiffs might derive some small comfort from hearing a court tell them that their segregation was privately enforced rather than governmentally enforced. They might still feel that they stood equal before the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the district court entered formal judgment for the defendants, it did not in fact decline to make <i>any</i> declaration of the rights of the parties, but in those parts of its conclusions of law which I have quoted, 174 F.Supp. at page 68, as construed in connection with the cases cited, it held that the redeveloper is a mere private individual and as such free to discriminate in sales to persons of different races. For reasons presently to be stated, I do not agree with that conclusion, but, by the same token, I do agree that injunction at the present stage of development of the plans should be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court relied upon two cases in considering that sales by the redeveloper would not constitute state action within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, 1949, 299 N.Y. 512, 87 N.E.2d 541, 14 A.L.R.2d 133, and Johnson v. Levitt &amp; Sons, D.C.E.D.Pa. 1955, 131 F.Supp. 114. In the Johnson case the district court held that F.H.A. and V.A., as federal agencies guaranteeing mortgages on housing projects, had no duty to prevent discrimination in sales of houses, and injunction did not lie to restrain agencies from insuring mortgages so long as the project proprietor discriminated against purchasers because of race and color.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, supra, the New York Court of Appeals held that a corporation organized under the New York Redevelopment Companies Law, McKinney's Unconsol.Laws, &#167; 3401 et seq., to provide low-cost housing is not an agency of the state and hence is not prohibited by the equal protection clauses of the State and Federal Constitutions from discriminating against prospective tenants because of race, color, or religion. The case is unusually well considered both by Judge Bromley, speaking for the majority of four, and by Judge Fuld, speaking for the three dissenting judges. The majority arrives at the conclusion that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"* * * The aid which the State has afforded to respondents and the control to which they are subject are not sufficient to transmute their conduct into State action under the constitutional provisions here in question.\" 299 N.Y. 536, 87 N.E.2d 551, 14 A.L.R.2d 146.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of the aid furnished by the State and Federal Governments to the redeveloper and of the control to which the redeveloper is subject readily distinguishes the present case from either of the cases upon which the district court relied. In Johnson v. Levitt &amp; Sons, supra, the federal agencies simply guaranteed mortgages on housing projects. In Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, supra, the City of New York agreed to condemn the land necessary for the project and to grant a tax exemption, but the full cost of construction and land acquisition was to be borne by the corporation. In the present case, the entire cost of land acquisition, and of the land itself, less such \"use value\" as may be required to be paid by the redeveloper, is to be borne by government funds, approximately two-thirds by the United States and one-third by the City of Gadsden. Of even more importance, the redeveloper is an essential participant in the overall plans for redevelopment here involved. The federal statute made it necessary for the Authority to require the redeveloper to carry the plan into execution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The formal plans approved by the City of Gadsden contained detailed and specific \"Controls on Redevelopment\" requiring \"The redeveloper to begin and complete the development of Project Land acquired by it for the use required by the Redevelopment Plan * * *.\" If Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, supra, had presented a like extent of governmental aid and of state control of the corporation, I believe that the majority must have agreed with the dissenters' view that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"* * * Unmistakable are the signs that this undertaking was a governmentally conceived, governmentally aided and governmentally regulated project in urban redevelopment.\" 299 N.Y. 542, 87 N.E.2d 555, 14 A.L.R.2d 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I would not repeat a reference to the authorities so well discussed in Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, supra, but would refer briefly to a few later decisions. Among these is our own case of Derrington v. Plummer, 5 Cir., 1956, 240 F.2d 922, in which we held that, where a county leases a cafeteria in a newly constructed courthouse to a private tenant operator, the tenant's exclusion of persons merely because they were Negroes constituted state action in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In N.A.A.C.P. v. State of Alabama, 1958, 357 U.S. 449, 462, 463, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1172, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We think that the production order, in the respects here drawn in question, must be regarded as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner's members of their right to freedom of association. Petitioner has made an uncontroverted showing that on past occasions revelation of the identity of its rank-and-file members has exposed these members to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility. Under these circumstances, we think it apparent that compelled disclosure of petitioner's Alabama membership is likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue their collective effort to foster beliefs which they admittedly have the right to advocate, in that it may induce members to withdraw from the Association and dissuade others from joining it because of fear of exposure of their beliefs shown through their associations and of the consequences of this exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"It is not sufficient to answer, as the State does here, that whatever repressive effect compulsory disclosure of names of petitioner's members may have upon participation by Alabama citizens in petitioner's activities follows not from <i>state</i> action but from <i>private</i> community pressures. The crucial factor is the interplay of governmental and private action, for it is only after the initial exertion of state power represented by the production order that private action takes hold.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few other late Supreme Court cases illustrative of the principle that governmental action may include the action of a private person who performs a governmental function are: Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Howard, 1952, 343 U.S. 768, 72 S.Ct. 1022, 96 L.Ed. 1283; Terry v. Adams, 1953, 345 U.S. 461, 73 S.Ct. 809, 97 L.Ed. 1152, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Board of Directors of City Trusts, 1957, 353 U.S. 230, 77 S.Ct. 806, 1 L.Ed.2d 792.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my opinion, the plan has not been completed until the property passes out of the control of the redeveloper, and hence in disposing of property within either of the Areas the redeveloper may not discriminate between purchasers on the basis of race or color. We should, I think, follow the course so well outlined by Judge Johnson of the Middle District of Alabama in Tate v. City of Eufaula, Alabama, D.C.M.D.Ala.1958, 165 F.Supp. 303, 306, 307:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"* * * this Court must now assume that these defendants, their agents and successors in office, after receiving the federal assistance in this public project, will, upon a completion of this project (or any phase of it), recognize the law that is now so clear; this law being to the effect that there can be no governmentally enforced segregation solely because of race or color. * * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"If these defendants, their agents or successors, as public officers and with federal financial assistance complete this project or any phase of it, they do so with the certain knowledge that there must be a full and good faith compliance with this existing. law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that the judgment should be affirmed in so far as it denies an injunction, but, to the extent that it seems to me actually but erroneously to declare the rights of the parties, I think that the judgment should be reversed and judgment here rendered declaring such rights as stated in this opinion. I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>APPENDIX</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>Material Facts Not Fully Set Forth in the District Court's Findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Gadsden is an Alabama municipal corporation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> and the Greater Gadsden Housing Authority is a public body corporate organized under the laws of the State of Alabama.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each of the four Negro plaintiffs owns a house in which he resides located in the Birmingham Street Area. Each member of the represented class of about fifty other Negro citizens owns a house in one of the areas planned for redevelopment. The North Fifth Street Area contains a considerable amount of vacant land and is planned to be redeveloped ahead of the Birmingham Street Area, so as to provide living space in the form of 128 small building lots for some of the families displaced by the later demolition of the Birmingham Street Area. The latter area is then to be redeveloped to provide 121 large building lots for single-family homes.

Then I will ask you the same question with reference to the Birmingham Street area. It is contemplated that the Birmingham Street area when redeveloped will be available for any non-white occupancy? A. The relocation plan, as I mentioned, is the place where we have to look carefully under the provisions of 105(c) to determine the financial ability of displaced families and, therefore, North Fifth Street is a factor in the feasibility of relocation strictly from an economic point of view. With respect to the Birmingham Street, the plans in compliance with the federal law conform to the plan for the community as a whole and of the neighborhood in particular, and in that case on the basis of marketability studies and indications of probable types of development, it appeared that the land there would be substantially more costly than the land that would be provided in the North Fifth Street area.

The area is occupied by Negroes, but the number is too few to justify provisions of proper recreational, school, and social facilities.'</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The recent survey brought out, more forcefully because it was more detailed, the facts stated in the Master Plan's diagnosis: the poor quality of housing, lack of public and community facilities, and overcrowding. These conditions are in strong contrast to those of the surrounding section which, except for a small commercial center to the north, is characterized by homes of good quality.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The opportunity to reconstitute the area as a residential district in harmony with its surroundings was the main reason for its selection as the number one redevelopment site.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The North Fifth Street Site</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A relatively small amount of housing &#8212; standard or substandard &#8212; exists on the North Fifth Street site. This, in fact, is the principal reason for its selection as a companion project to the Birmingham Street one: it will permit redevelopment for a greater number of families than clearance of the site will displace, thus affording home sites for those occupants of the Birmingham Street site who are not eligible for relocation in public housing or who, for reasons of their own, prefer single-family or duplex dwellings.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A second important reason for selection of this area for redevelopment is the incentive it will provide for further extension of the Negro neighborhood up along the foothills of Shinbone Ridge. While some of the terrain is steep, much of it is gently rolling and well drained; this can be developed as an open residential section, convenient to school and social centers as well as to the central business district and industries of the city.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The Projected Plans</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"In most Southern cities there is a scarcity of vacant land located close to schools and churches and shopping districts and served by city utilities and transportation, land that is suitable and desirable for expansion of Negro neighborhoods or creation of new ones. This is true of Gadsden.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"But sometimes careful search will reveal areas that have been overlooked or by-passed or, for some other reason, have not been exploited for this purpose. The North Fifth Street site is such an area.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Blighted in its south part and spoiled for residential use north of Tuscaloosa Avenue by a sprawling but small industrial enterprise, this site is, nevertheless, one that offers the possibility for a new offshoot from the Tuscaloosa Avenue neighborhood. It is close to schools, churches, lodges, swimming pool, and playgrounds, as well as to the Tuscaloosa Avenue business section. It can easily be served with city utilities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Most importantly, it gives, to the north, onto a large open space that can be used for expansion of the small development to be created initially through this program.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Use of Land</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A feature of the plan is the four-acre site allocated to a community center; here the city will in future construct an auditorium to serve the Negro community. A small play-field to augment existing recreational facilities in the neighborhood will be provided in conjunction with the center.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Located half a mile from the central business district, the Birmingham Street section will offer spacious home sites on quiet residential streets, newly paved and serviced with utilities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Like the Birmingham Street Area, this area is only a short distance from the central business district of the city. And it is equally well served with city utilities and community facilities, elementary and high schools for Negro children being less than half a mile away. The North Fifth Street Area is, in fact, virtually the only such close-in land available for expansion of the Negro community.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Provision is made at the north extreme of the area for continuing North Fifth Street beyond this site so that the Negro neighborhood can be expanded by private developers.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Survey Areas</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Survey Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The core of this area is a group of squalid dwellings occupied by Negro families, some of whose grandparents undoubtedly also occupied this same old servants' quarters section. There are no schools, parks, or social facilities, but the residents have built several churches which fill an important social need as well as the religious one.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Community Facilities</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Survey Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Of the five churches, two serve the Negro neighborhood at Birmingham Street, the others having city-wide white congregations.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Racial Occupancy</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"While occupancy of dwelling units in the Birmingham Street Survey Area is evenly divided (323 white and 331 Negro), it is the sections of Negro occupancy &#8212; Birmingham-Bay Streets and St. John's Alley &#8212; that coincide with the sections of blighted housing.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"In the North Fifth Street Survey Area Negro families occupy about 40% of the dwellings, but the fact that so little of the area is built up leaves its future racial status still in doubt.

The plaintiffs seek a declaration and injunction against the execution and putting into effect of certain urban redevelopment plans of the City of Gadsden, Alabama, attacked upon the ground that they foster enforced racial segregation. The district court entered judgment in favor of defendants pursuant to findings of fact and conclusions of law, now reported in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1754465\"><a href=\"/opinion/1754465/barnes-v-city-of-gadsden/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Recognizing the importance of this litigation to the public, as well as to the litigants, I have set forth those facts at considerable length in an appendix to this opinion. Excluding those items of doubtful value or of questionable admissibility, but otherwise carefully considering the entire record, I cannot escape the conclusion that <i>actual</i> segregation is contemplated. So long as that is voluntary, rather than governmentally enforced, there can be no constitutional objection. As we said in Cohen v. Public Housing Administration, 5 Cir., 1958, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span>, 78:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Mr. Stillwell's testimony has been noted (footnote 7, supra) to the effect that in his opinion actual segregation is essential to the success of a program of public housing in Savannah. If the people involved think that such is the case and if Negroes and whites desire to maintain voluntary segregation for their common good, there is certainly no law to prevent such cooperation. Neither the Fifth nor the Fourteenth Amendment operates positively to command integration of the races but only negatively to forbid governmentally enforced segregation.<sup>11</sup></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"11.

It is by no means clear that plaintiffs or any of the occupants of these areas will even want to move back into such areas after redevelopment.

Enforced segregation might well be the practical result, whether or not so intended by the defendants. The plaintiffs might derive some small comfort from hearing a court tell them that their segregation was privately enforced rather than governmentally enforced.

In the Johnson case the district court held that F.H.A. and V.A., as federal agencies guaranteeing mortgages on housing projects, had no duty to prevent discrimination in sales of houses, and injunction did not lie to restrain agencies from insuring mortgages so long as the project proprietor discriminated against purchasers because of race and color.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Dorsey v.

In Johnson v. Levitt &amp; Sons, supra, the federal agencies simply guaranteed mortgages on housing projects. In Dorsey v. Stuyvesant Town Corporation, supra, the City of New York agreed to condemn the land necessary for the project and to grant a tax exemption, but the full cost of construction and land acquisition was to be borne by the corporation. In the present case, the entire cost of land acquisition, and of the land itself, less such \"use value\" as may be required to be paid by the redeveloper, is to be borne by government funds, approximately two-thirds by the United States and one-third by the City of Gadsden.

The relocation plan, as I mentioned, is the place where we have to look carefully under the provisions of 105(c) to determine the financial ability of displaced families and, therefore, North Fifth Street is a factor in the feasibility of relocation strictly from an economic point of view. With respect to the Birmingham Street, the plans in compliance with the federal law conform to the plan for the community as a whole and of the neighborhood in particular, and in that case on the basis of marketability studies and indications of probable types of development, it appeared that the land there would be substantially more costly than the land that would be provided in the North Fifth Street area.

Lack of space for expansion led to \"building between\" until now these few blocks contain 250 dwellings. The area is occupied by Negroes, but the number is too few to justify provisions of proper recreational, school, and social facilities.'</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The recent survey brought out, more forcefully because it was more detailed, the facts stated in the Master Plan's diagnosis: the poor quality of housing, lack of public and community facilities, and overcrowding. These conditions are in strong contrast to those of the surrounding section which, except for a small commercial center to the north, is characterized by homes of good quality.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The opportunity to reconstitute the area as a residential district in harmony with its surroundings was the main reason for its selection as the number one redevelopment site.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The North Fifth Street Site</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A relatively small amount of housing &#8212; standard or substandard &#8212; exists on the North Fifth Street site. This, in fact, is the principal reason for its selection as a companion project to the Birmingham Street one: it will permit redevelopment for a greater number of families than clearance of the site will displace, thus affording home sites for those occupants of the Birmingham Street site who are not eligible for relocation in public housing or who, for reasons of their own, prefer single-family or duplex dwellings.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A second important reason for selection of this area for redevelopment is the incentive it will provide for further extension of the Negro neighborhood up along the foothills of Shinbone Ridge. While some of the terrain is steep, much of it is gently rolling and well drained; this can be developed as an open residential section, convenient to school and social centers as well as to the central business district and industries of the city.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The Projected Plans</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"In most Southern cities there is a scarcity of vacant land located close to schools and churches and shopping districts and served by city utilities and transportation, land that is suitable and desirable for expansion of Negro neighborhoods or creation of new ones. This is true of Gadsden.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"But sometimes careful search will reveal areas that have been overlooked or by-passed or, for some other reason, have not been exploited for this purpose. The North Fifth Street site is such an area.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Blighted in its south part and spoiled for residential use north of Tuscaloosa Avenue by a sprawling but small industrial enterprise, this site is, nevertheless, one that offers the possibility for a new offshoot from the Tuscaloosa Avenue neighborhood. It is close to schools, churches, lodges, swimming pool, and playgrounds, as well as to the Tuscaloosa Avenue business section. It can easily be served with city utilities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Most importantly, it gives, to the north, onto a large open space that can be used for expansion of the small development to be created initially through this program.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Use of Land</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"A feature of the plan is the four-acre site allocated to a community center; here the city will in future construct an auditorium to serve the Negro community. A small play-field to augment existing recreational facilities in the neighborhood will be provided in conjunction with the center.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Located half a mile from the central business district, the Birmingham Street section will offer spacious home sites on quiet residential streets, newly paved and serviced with utilities.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"North Fifth Street Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Like the Birmingham Street Area, this area is only a short distance from the central business district of the city. And it is equally well served with city utilities and community facilities, elementary and high schools for Negro children being less than half a mile away. The North Fifth Street Area is, in fact, virtually the only such close-in land available for expansion of the Negro community.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Provision is made at the north extreme of the area for continuing North Fifth Street beyond this site so that the Negro neighborhood can be expanded by private developers.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Survey Areas</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Survey Area</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"The core of this area is a group of squalid dwellings occupied by Negro families, some of whose grandparents undoubtedly also occupied this same old servants' quarters section. There are no schools, parks, or social facilities, but the residents have built several churches which fill an important social need as well as the religious one.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Community Facilities</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Birmingham Street Survey Area</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Of the five churches, two serve the Negro neighborhood at Birmingham Street, the others having city-wide white congregations.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"Racial Occupancy</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"While occupancy of dwelling units in the Birmingham Street Survey Area is evenly divided (323 white and 331 Negro), it is the sections of Negro occupancy &#8212; Birmingham-Bay Streets and St. John's Alley &#8212; that coincide with the sections of blighted housing.</p>\n        <p>* * * * * * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">\"In the North Fifth Street Survey Area Negro families occupy about 40% of the dwellings, but the fact that so little of the area is built up leaves its future racial status still in doubt. North of Tuscaloosa Avenue only specific planning, such as is advocated in this redevelopment proposal, can forecast the future racial occupancy.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">That document also contained a colored map with \"Source: City Directory, 1952\" showing \"Racial Occupancy and Home Ownership\" and other maps showing the projected plans for the North 5th Street area, including a \"Proposed Colored Auditorium\" and \"Playfield (Col.).\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
