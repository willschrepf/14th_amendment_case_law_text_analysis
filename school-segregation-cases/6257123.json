Spangler for Real Parties in Interest and Respondents.\n\f       Plaintiffs Clews Land and Livestock, LLC; Barbara Clews; and Christian Clews\n\n(collectively, CLL) appeal a judgment in favor of defendant City of San Diego (City) on\n\nCLL's petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,\n\nviolation of procedural due process, and equitable estoppel. CLL's petition and\n\ncomplaint challenged the City's approval of a project to build a private secondary school\n\non land neighboring CLL's commercial horse ranch and equestrian facility and the City's\n\nadoption of a mitigated negative declaration (MND) regarding the project. The for-profit\n\nschool, the Cal Coast Academy, is being developed by real parties in interest Jan\n\nDunning, Cal Coast Academy RE Holdings, LLC, and the North County Center for\n\nEducational Development, Inc. (collectively, Cal Coast).\n\n       CLL contends the court erred by denying its petition and resolving its remaining\n\nclaims in favor of the City. It argues the City should not have adopted the MND because\n\nthe Cal Coast Academy project would cause significant environmental impacts in the\n\nareas of fire hazards, traffic and transportation, noise, recreation, and historical resources,\n\nand because the MND identified new impacts and mitigation measures that were not\n\nincluded in the draft MND. CLL further argues the City should not have approved the\n\nproject because it is situated in designated open space under the applicable community\n\nland use plan and because the City did not follow the provisions of the San Diego\n\nMunicipal Code (SDMC) applicable to historical resources.\n\n       The City and Cal Coast respond that CLL did not exhaust its administrative\n\nremedies because it failed to appeal the decision adopting the MND to the San Diego\n\nCity Council. On the merits, the City and Cal Coast argue the project would not cause\n\n                                               2\n\fany significant environmental impacts in the areas identified by CLL, the project is not\n\ninconsistent with the open space designation, and the City complied with the historical\n\nresources provisions of the SDMC.\n\n       For reasons we will explain, we conclude CLL's challenge to the MND is barred\n\nbecause it did not exhaust its administrative remedies in proceedings before the City. In\n\ndoing so, we reject CLL's argument that the City's process for administrative appeals—at\n\nleast as implicated by this project—violates the California Environmental Quality Act\n\n(CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) 1 by improperly splitting the adoption of\n\nan environmental document (e.g., the MND) from the project approvals. We further\n\nconclude CLL's challenge to the MND fails on its merits, even assuming CLL had\n\nexhausted its administrative remedies. Finally, we conclude the City complied with all\n\napplicable requirements of the SDMC regarding historical resources and the City's\n\napproval of the project does not conflict with the open space designation because the\n\nproject will be located on already-developed land. We therefore affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Public Resources Code unless otherwise\nstated. The administrative guidelines adopted by the Secretary for Resources to\nimplement CEQA (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) will be referred to as\n\"Guidelines\" followed by the section number. \"We need not decide for purposes of this\nappeal whether the Guidelines are binding on the courts. At a minimum . . . the\nGuidelines are entitled to great weight so long as they are not clearly unauthorized or\nerroneous.\" (California Oak Foundation v. Regents of University of California (2010)\n188 Cal.App.4th 227, 240, fn. 3.)\n                                            3\n\f                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                              The Project and Its Surroundings\n\n       The project consists of a 5,340-square-foot school, divided into three classroom\n\nbuildings under a single roof, on an approximately one-acre site. The school will have a\n\nmaximum enrollment of 75 students, with 18 staff members. Along with the school, the\n\nproject proposes construction of a 24-stall parking lot, landscaping, and removal of\n\ncertain existing features on the site, including a concrete-filled swimming pool.\n\n       A farmhouse at the site was built around 1900 and is a designated historical\n\nresource, part of the larger Mount Carmel Ranch (Historical Resources Board No. 391).\n\nCal Coast currently uses the farmhouse as an administrative office, and it will continue to\n\ndo so following project completion. Several older outbuildings exist at the site as well.\n\nThe project will not affect the farmhouse or outbuildings, and the school's design\n\nincorporates features intended to ensure compatibility with the historic nature of the site.\n\n       The site is adjacent to CLL's equestrian facility, the Clews Horse Ranch. The\n\nranch consists of a 45-stall parking lot, corrals, stables, riding areas, a barn, a club house,\n\nand two or three single family homes. A riding ring abuts the project site. The ranch has\n\nfacilities for over a hundred horses and a dozen cattle. Individuals come to the ranch to\n\nride or participate in other equestrian activities. The ranch also holds a popular rodeo.\n\n       The project site is situated at the end of Clews Ranch Road, a 1,650-foot private\n\ndriveway that also provides access to the ranch. It is approximately 20 feet wide and has\n\na posted speed limit of 10 miles per hour. Clews Ranch Road runs east-to-west and\n\nconnects with Carmel Country Road. At that intersection, a public parking lot serves\n\n                                               4\n\frecreational bicycle and hiking trails in the area. Clews Ranch Road is the sole vehicular\n\naccessway for both the project site and the ranch, although a dirt road runs westward\n\nfrom the site and connects with Carmel Creek Road. The project site sits on a bluff\n\nabove State Route 56, a busy divided highway. Across the highway is a developed\n\nsuburban area.\n\n       The site lies within the \"Neighborhood 8\" portion of Carmel Valley, a designated\n\ncommunity plan area within the City. Under the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise\n\nPlan, the site is designated as open space. The site is zoned residential MF-1, which\n\nallows construction of multifamily dwellings up to a density of seven to fifteen units per\n\nacre. MF-1 zoning allows \"by right\" construction of primary and secondary schools. The\n\nsite is also within the coastal zone. When the neighboring ranch was permitted in 2007,\n\nthe City changed its zoning from multifamily residential to agricultural. The ranch is also\n\ndesignated open space.\n\n                                  The City's Initial Study\n\n       Cal Coast applied to the City for the approvals necessary to develop the project.\n\nIn an initial study, City staff determined the project would not have a significant impact\n\non any environmental factors, with the exception of \"cultural resources,\" i.e.,\n\narchaeological and paleontological resources. Such resources may exist in the project\n\narea. However, City staff concluded the environmental impact would be less than\n\nsignificant if mitigation measures were adopted, including on-site monitoring during\n\ngrading activities.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       As relevant here, the initial study also assessed the project's potential impacts on\n\nhistorical resources, fire hazards, land use and planning, noise, recreation, and\n\ntransportation and traffic. The initial study identified the farmhouse as a historical\n\nresource, but it determined that the project's effects on the farmhouse would be less than\n\nsignificant because the farmhouse and outbuilding structures would be maintained and\n\nbecause the school's design was consistent with the City's historical resource regulations.\n\nAs to fire hazards, the initial study noted the project site was adjacent to native or\n\nnaturalized vegetation in the Carmel Valley River Enhancement Program (CVREP) area\n\nalong State Route 56. Based on its location, the project would be subject to brush\n\nmanagement regulations. In addition, the project's design incorporated fire resistant\n\nmaterials and tempered glass windows. Based on these factors, the initial study\n\nconcluded that the project would not \"expose people or structures to a significant risk of\n\nloss, injury or death involving wildland fires.\" As to land use, the initial study\n\ndetermined the project was compatible with the community plan and permitted by the\n\nunderlying multifamily residential zoning. As to noise, it found no environmental\n\nimpact. The initial study noted that the project would not be a \"permanent noise\n\ngenerating source\" and \"would not expose people to a substantial increase in temporary\n\nor periodic ambient noise levels.\" As to recreation, the initial study concluded the project\n\nwould have no impact on recreational resources. And as to traffic and transportation, the\n\ninitial study likewise found no impact. It determined that the project was consistent with\n\nthe community plan and underlying zoning, would not cause any permanent increase in\n\ntraffic, and would not result in inadequate emergency access.\n\n                                              6\n\f                          The Draft MND and Public Comments\n\n       Based on the initial study, City staff prepared a draft MND for the project. The\n\ndraft MND described the proposed project (albeit as \"three modular buildings\" rather\n\nthan a single building), identified the potential impact on cultural resources, and\n\ndescribed the mitigation measures Cal Coast would adopt to lessen any such impact. The\n\nCity's initial study was attached to the draft MND.\n\n       Several interested parties submitted comments in response to the draft MND. Two\n\nNative American tribes wrote regarding cultural resources. City staff responded by\n\npointing out the mitigation measures in the draft MND. The San Diego County\n\nArchaeological Society wrote to clarify the qualifications of any archaeological monitor.\n\nA consultant engaged by Cal Coast requested certain technical corrections, including\n\nchanging the description of the project from \"three modular buildings\" to \"a new single-\n\nstory building.\"\n\n       CLL submitted comments criticizing the use of an MND for the project. It\n\ncontended the City was required to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR).\n\nAmong other things, CLL argued that potential impacts on historical resources, fire\n\nhazards, noise, and transportation and traffic should be studied in an EIR. CLL believed\n\nthe draft MND's treatment of historical resources was inadequate without a\n\ncomprehensive survey of the project site. It further believed the draft MND did not\n\nadequately consider the hazards to students and teachers from wildfires, especially given\n\nthe limited access to the project site. CLL contended the draft MND ignored the impact\n\nof noise on the Clews Horse Ranch and alleged the project \"create[d] a real threat to the\n\n                                              7\n\fviability of the ranch as [a] place to board and train horses.\" (A ranch creditor also wrote\n\nto complain that approval of the project would \"impair[] the ability of Clews Ranch to\n\nrealize its economic potential and therefore impairs the security of [his] loan.\") Finally,\n\nCLL argued the project's use of Clews Ranch Road would overburden the easement held\n\nby the project site over the road.\n\n       A ranch client submitted comments that echoed CLL's concerns regarding noise.\n\nThe individual noted the ranch's riding area was very close to the project site. He alleged\n\nconstruction activities at the project site had caused \"loud, unanticipated noise, or\n\nblowing plastic sheets\" that caused him and other riders to be thrown from their horses.\n\nHe further alleged that Clews Ranch Road could not handle additional traffic and had\n\nnumerous blind spots. He believed additional traffic would endanger horses and riders\n\nthat use the road. As to the latter concerns, City staff responded that the dimensions,\n\nalignment, and surfacing of the road had been reviewed by City engineering,\n\ntransportation, and fire personnel, who determined it was adequate to serve both the\n\nschool and the ranch. City staff noted Cal Coast had proposed to use a shuttle bus service\n\nto transport students to the school from the public parking lot at the intersection of Clews\n\nRanch Road and Carmel Country Road, thereby reducing traffic on Clews Ranch Road.\n\n       CLL engaged a fire safety consultant, Van Collingsworth, to submit additional\n\ncomments regarding fire hazards related to the project. Collingsworth concluded the\n\nproject had significant adverse fire safety impacts that required preparation of an EIR.\n\nHe noted the project site was within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone and a flood\n\nplain. Collingsworth identified a large number of questions regarding fire safety that he\n\n                                              8\n\falleged went unanswered in the draft MND. These questions revolved around topics such\n\nas the project's design and construction standards, the evacuation plan for the school, first\n\nresponder response times and capabilities, and brush management guidelines.\n\nCollingsworth also provided general information regarding the vulnerability of structures\n\nand people to wildfires, the strength and intensity of expected wildfires, the impact of\n\ndrought conditions on fire behavior, and the safety of firefighters and other emergency\n\npersonnel. He expressed concern that Clews Ranch Road would be inadequate to\n\nevacuate the school in addition to the animals and people at the ranch. Finally, he\n\nasserted without citation that \"[t]raffic is already constrained and gridlocked during\n\ncommuter hours on and offsite under current conditions.\"\n\n       City staff reviewed Collingsworth's comments and did not believe he had raised\n\nany significant environmental impacts. The fire marshal had reviewed the project and\n\nfound it complied with City fire codes. Similarly, an outside consultant engaged by Cal\n\nCoast had prepared a wildfire analysis in response to Collingsworth's comments. The\n\nconsultant identified no significant impacts regarding fire safety. Cal Coast also\n\nsubmitted a brush management plan and a fire protection and emergency evacuation plan,\n\nwhich described two evacuation routes (one eastward and one westward) in the event of\n\nan emergency.\n\n       City staff identified several project design features that reduced the potential for\n\nfire hazard impacts, including fire resistant building materials, brush removal, a new\n\nwater line and fire hydrant serving the project site, and an annually reviewed evacuation\n\nplan. They described the contents of the school's evacuation plan, including exit routes\n\n                                              9\n\feast along Clews Ranch Road to Carmel Country Road and west along a dirt road to\n\nCarmel Creek Road. City staff noted the school intended to close on red flag warning\n\ndays out of an abundance of caution. For fires that might originate at the school, City\n\nstaff noted among other things that the project will incorporate interior sprinklers that\n\nsuccessfully suppress 98 percent of fires.\n\n       Cal Coast engaged a consultant to prepare an analysis of potential noise impacts\n\ncaused by the project. The consultant reported that school would be in session from 8:30\n\na.m. until 2:00 p.m., with morning and lunch breaks. No physical education classes\n\nwould be on site, and the school would not use bells or other alarms (except for fire\n\nalarms). Given the proximity of State Route 56, approximately 200 feet from the project\n\nsite, the consultant found the average ambient noise level at the site was approximately\n\n60 decibels. The consultant identified the loudest likely noise generated by students and\n\nfaculty at the school as laughter, which has a level of approximately 88 decibels. It\n\nmodeled a worst-case scenario, where the laughter was continuous over a one-hour\n\nperiod, and the weighted average noise levels ranged between 38 and 49 decibels at the\n\nreceivers in the model. Because these levels were less than the observed noise level at\n\nthe site, the consultant concluded the project's noise impact would not exceed levels that\n\nwould disturb sensitive wildlife under the City's noise significance determination\n\nthresholds.\n\n                          The Final MND and Public Comments\n\n       After receiving the comments and reports described above, City staff prepared a\n\nfinal MND for the project. The final MND incorporated Cal Coast's requested change to\n\n                                             10\n\fthe project description, as well as new information from the reports and analyses prepared\n\nby Cal Coast. For example, City staff changed their conclusion regarding emergency\n\naccess to the project from \"no impact\" to \"less than significant impact\" and added detail\n\nregarding the City's review of emergency access to the school. After review by the San\n\nDiego Fire Department, City staff determined the school met its emergency access\n\nrequirements. This determination was supported by Cal Coast's fire consultant, who\n\nconcluded that the project would not expose people or structures to a significant risk of\n\nloss, injury, or death from wildland fires. The final MND confirmed, however, that \"the\n\nphysical scope of the project, project impacts, proposed mitigation measures and\n\nconclusions of the [MND] are not affected by the revisions.\"\n\n       After City staff prepared the final MND, the Carmel Valley Community Planning\n\nBoard (CVCPB) considered the project. Christian Clews is a member of the CVCPB, but\n\nhe recused himself from its consideration of the project. Several board members\n\nexpressed concern about the multifamily residential zoning of the project site and\n\nexpressed their desire to have open space there. The project was put to a vote by the\n\nboard. The vote failed, with five in favor, four opposed, and two abstentions. Nine votes\n\nwere required to support the project.\n\n       The board chair subsequently wrote to the City to describe the \"unusual dilemma\"\n\nthe project posed to the board. He wrote that the site's multifamily residential zoning\n\nseemed incompatible with the community plan, which designated the site as open space.\n\n(For this reason, the chair abstained from the vote.) The chair stated that he personally\n\ndid not object to a school at the site because it appeared to be an acceptable use of the\n\n                                             11\n\fprotected area. But other board members expressed concern that the school's use of the\n\nsite would not be compatible with the horse ranch next door. The chair believed further\n\nstudy of the issue was needed. Other board objections included concerns over the impact\n\nof noise and traffic on the horse ranch, the impact of the school's operation on the public\n\nparking lot that would be used by the school's shuttle buses, the impact of development\n\non the rural setting and nearby recreational trails, the severity of fire hazards and the\n\nadequacy of evacuation routes, and the general sense that \"many issues still could use\n\nmore detailed and guaranteed solutions.\"\n\n       CLL submitted additional comments objecting to allegedly significant changes to\n\nthe project and demanding recirculation of the MND. CLL also argued that the City had\n\nnot complied with its historical resource regulations. Collingsworth submitted additional\n\ncomments as well that criticized the project's brush management and evacuation plans.\n\nHe also rebutted the City's responses to comments on the draft MND.\n\n                          Proceedings Before the Hearing Officer\n\n       The City scheduled a public hearing on the project before a City hearing officer.\n\nIn a report to the hearing officer, City staff recommended the project be approved in full,\n\ni.e., the final MND be adopted and permits for coastal development and site development\n\nbe issued. The report described the current site conditions, the proposed project, and the\n\ngoverning community plan. It noted the site was within an area of designated open\n\nspace, but it concluded that the project was consistent with the community plan's open\n\nspace policies because the new development did not extend beyond previously developed\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fand disturbed areas. After hearing speakers for and against approval, the hearing officer\n\napproved the project and adopted the MND.\n\n       The public hearing notice stated, \"The decision of the Hearing Officer is final\n\nunless appealed to the Planning Commission,\" and \"The decision made by the Planning\n\nCommission is the final decision by the City.\" It then advised, \"The adoption of [an\n\nMND] may be appealed to the City Council after all other appeal rights have been\n\nexhausted. All such appeals must be filed by 5:00 PM within ten (10) business days from\n\nthe date of the Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the environmental\n\ndocument.\"\n\n       At the time of the hearing, the City published Information Bulletin 505, a guide to\n\nthe City's appeal procedure under the SDMC. The City divides its procedures for\n\napproving development applications into different numbered processes. (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0501.) The City handled the project at issue here under Process Three. The\n\nbulletin stated, \"Process Two and Three permit decisions are appealable to the Planning\n\nCommission. Process Four permit decisions are appealable to the City Council. Appeals\n\nof Environmental Determinations may be made after all project appeal rights have been\n\nexhausted.\" It further stated, \"All appeals must be made in accordance with the\n\nprocedures listed in Chapter 11, Article 2, Division 5. All appeals must be made no later\n\nthan close of business, within ten (10) business days of the original decision date (Process\n\nThree and Four) . . . .\" The bulletin specified the filing location for \"Process Two and\n\nThree Decisions Appealable to the Planning Commission\" as the City's Development\n\nServices Department, and the filing location for \"Process Four Decisions and\n\n                                            13\n\fEnvironmental Determinations Appealable to the City Council\" as the City Clerk's\n\nOffice. 2\n\n                           Appeal to the Planning Commission\n\n       CLL appealed the hearing officer's decision to the Planning Commission on a City\n\nform, DS-3031. CLL selected \"Process Three Decision - Appeal to the Planning\n\nCommission\" as the \"Type of Appeal.\" It filed the form with the City's Development\n\nServices Department. It did not select \"Environmental Determination - Appeal to City\n\nCouncil\" or file the form with the City Clerk's Office.\n\n       CLL identified numerous grounds for appeal. It contended the hearing officer's\n\nfindings under CEQA and in the final MND were not supported, including in the areas of\n\ntraffic and transportation, noise, hazards, and cultural resources. It also contended the\n\nproject's approval conflicted with the City's historical resource regulations and the\n\nCarmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan.\n\n       In a report to the Planning Commission, City staff recommended that CLL's\n\nappeal be denied. After recounting the conditions at the site and the description of the\n\nproject, the report addressed the issues identified by CLL's appeal. The report noted that\n\nan MND had been adopted by the hearing officer, but no appeal had been filed\n\nchallenging that environmental determination. The report stated that the time to appeal\n\nhad expired 10 business days after the hearing officer's decision, so any issues based on\n\n\n\n2      As we will discuss in detail below, the parties dispute the accuracy of the\ndescriptions of the City's appeal procedure in Information Bulletin 505 and the public\nhearing notice.\n                                             14\n\fCEQA or the MND had been waived. The report rejected CLL's contention that the City\n\nfailed to comply with its historical resources regulations. The project would maintain the\n\nexisting historic farmhouse, and the new construction was consistent with the\n\nfarmhouse's aesthetics. Based on these facts, the project was consistent with federal\n\nstandards for historical resource preservation and did not require a site development\n\npermit under the City's historical resource regulations. (A site development permit was\n\nrequired, however, based on its location in the Carmel Valley community plan area.) The\n\nreport further rejected CLL's contention that the project conflicted with the community\n\nplan's open space designation for reasons previously discussed.\n\n       CLL objected to the report's characterization of its appeal. In correspondence with\n\nCity staff, CLL argued it had appealed the hearing officer's environmental determination,\n\nas evidenced by its statement of the grounds of appeal. CLL claimed it was not required\n\nto appeal the environmental determination to the City Council until its other appeals had\n\nbeen exhausted, i.e., after the Planning Commission rendered its decision. City staff\n\nresponded that CLL was welcome to present its argument to the Planning Commission.\n\n       At the Planning Commission's first hearing on the project, a commissioner asked\n\nthe deputy city attorney present about the scope of CLL's appeal. The attorney responded\n\nthat CLL had not properly appealed the hearing officer's environmental determination\n\nbecause it had not indicated on its appeal form that it was pursuing an appeal of that\n\ndetermination. She explained, \"Had [the appropriate box] been checked, this appeal\n\nwould be set before the City Council and would not be heard before this body.\" Later in\n\nthe hearing, a commissioner expressed sympathy with CLL's position, finding it clear that\n\n                                            15\n\fCLL attempted to appeal both the permit approvals and the environmental determination.\n\nShe requested that the appeal be returned to City staff and calendared before the City\n\nCouncil. The deputy city attorney responded that the appeal procedures are laid out in\n\nthe SDMC, and it would be impossible to transfer the appeal to the City Council. The\n\ncommissioner further requested that the City's appeal form and information bulletin be\n\nrevised to reflect the correct procedures. The attorney said they would follow-up on the\n\ncommissioner's request. After hearing numerous speakers for and against the project,\n\nincluding both fire experts, the Planning Commission trailed consideration of the project\n\nto its next meeting.\n\n       At the next meeting, the commissioners questioned Cal Coast, CLL, and their\n\nrepresentatives. However, the Planning Commission was unable to reach the four-vote\n\nthreshold to act on the project. The vote on a motion to approve the project and deny\n\nCLL's appeal was three in favor and two opposed, with two not voting. Consideration of\n\nthe project was trailed again to a future meeting.\n\n       When the Planning Commission considered the project a third time, a motion to\n\napprove the project and deny CLL's appeal prevailed on a vote of four in favor, two\n\nopposed, and one not voting. The Planning Commission's decision was memorialized in\n\na resolution granting a coastal development permit and site development permit for the\n\nproject. The resolution and permits included extensive findings regarding the project and\n\nits compliance with the City's land use policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                           Attempted Appeal to the City Council\n\n       CLL attempted to file an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to the City\n\nCouncil. CLL used a redesigned form DS-3031 that identified the \"Type of Appeal\" as\n\neither \"Appeal of the Project\" or \"Appeal of the Environmental Determination.\" The\n\nvarious City processes, and the body to which the appeal was made, were no longer\n\nidentified on the form. CLL indicated it was appealing both the project and the\n\nenvironmental determination. As grounds for its appeal, CLL identified various\n\nenvironmental impacts it believed required preparation of an EIR, including\n\ntransportation and traffic, fire hazards, land use and planning, noise, and historical\n\nresources. CLL also contended, among other things, that the MND should have been\n\nrecirculated because the final MND contained significant revisions to the project and\n\nadditional mitigation measures. To justify its appeal, CLL referenced language in the\n\npublic hearing notice and information bulletin that purported to authorize an appeal of an\n\nenvironmental determination after all other appeal rights had been exhausted.\n\n       The City rejected CLL's appeal. In its rejection letter, the City stated that CLL's\n\nappeal challenging the environmental determination was untimely under the SDMC. The\n\nPlanning Commission's approval of permitting for the project was final and not\n\nappealable.\n\n                       Appeal to the California Coastal Commission\n\n       CLL then appealed to the California Coastal Commission. CLL argued, among\n\nother things, that the project was inconsistent with the City's Local Coastal Program\n\n(LCP). To support its argument, CLL pointed to the community plan's designation of the\n\n                                             17\n\farea as open space and the historic status of the farmhouse at the site. CLL claimed the\n\nCity failed to analyze the effect of the project on the functions of the open space,\n\nincluding the benefits of the CVREP recreation areas, and failed to follow its historical\n\nresource regulations. CLL also claimed the project would expose its horse ranch and\n\nusers of nearby trails to increased fire hazards because of inadequate evacuation routes.\n\n       Coastal Commission staff assessed CLL's appeal and found it raised no substantial\n\nissue. The staff's report concluded the project was consistent with the LCP. The report\n\nrejected CLL's open space argument because the site had already been developed and\n\ndisturbed, and it found the City had complied with its historical resource regulations. It\n\nfurther noted, \"Fire safety and evacuation is not a[n] LCP issue; however, the\n\ndevelopment complies with all fire-related requirements including brush management\n\nand building design.\" The report referenced a number of project elements that would\n\naddress fire hazards and fire safety.\n\n       The Coastal Commission's staff report concluded, \"[T]here is strong and legal\n\nsupport for the City's determination that the proposed development is consistent with the\n\ncertified LCP. . . . The extent and scope of the development is minor.\" At a public\n\nhearing, the Commission agreed with the report and found no substantial issue.\n\n                                Superior Court Proceedings\n\n       CLL then filed the instant petition for writ of mandate and complaint for\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, violation of procedural due process and equitable\n\nestoppel. The operative first amended petition and complaint alleged that the MND was\n\nimproperly adopted because the project would have significant environmental impacts in\n\n                                             18\n\fthe areas already discussed above and because the final MND had significant new\n\nmaterial that required recirculation. The petition and complaint repeated CLL's\n\ncontentions that the community plan's open space designation prohibited the project and\n\nthat the City failed to follow its historical resource regulations. The petition and\n\ncomplaint also challenged the City's appeal procedures. It alleged that the procedures did\n\nnot comply with CEQA because they segregated environmental determinations from\n\nproject approvals. It further alleged that the City did not provide adequate notice of the\n\nappellate procedures, thereby violating state law, the SDMC, and CLL's constitutional\n\nright to procedural due process. Finally, the petition and complaint alleged that the City\n\nshould be equitably estopped from claiming that CLL had not adequately appealed\n\nadoption of the MND because the public hearing notice and other documents inaccurately\n\ndescribed the appeal procedures.\n\n       After briefing and argument, the trial court denied the petition and rejected CLL's\n\nclaims. The court concluded CLL failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in City\n\nproceedings by failing to properly appeal the hearing officer's environmental\n\ndetermination. It found the City was not estopped from asserting a defense based on\n\nadministrative exhaustion and that the City's appeal procedure did not violate CEQA.\n\nEven if the defense did not apply, the court was unpersuaded that adoption of the MND\n\nwas unjustified. The court explained, \"The court agrees with the City and [Cal Coast]\n\nthat much of what motivated petitioners' objection to the building of the school next door\n\nhas nothing to do with environmental concerns. Petitioners just do not want the academy\n\nas a neighbor because they feel it will affect them adversely from an economic\n\n                                             19\n\fperspective.\" The court did not believe there was a fair argument that the project would\n\nsignificantly impact the environment. It stated, \"The dominant neighbor of the proposed\n\nacademy is [State Route] 56, hardly an environmentally sensitive area. The building\n\nproposed is small (5340 sq. ft. in a single story), and it will be unoccupied more days and\n\nhours than not. It strikes the court that requiring an expensive, time-consuming, and\n\nlikely to be challenged EIR for this modest project, which is about the size of a large\n\nhome, would be overkill.\" The court found CLL's remaining arguments unpersuasive and\n\nentered judgment accordingly. CLL appeals.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                                             I\n\n                                     CEQA Overview\n\n       \"CEQA was enacted to advance four related purposes: to (1) inform the\n\ngovernment and public about a proposed activity's potential environmental impacts; (2)\n\nidentify ways to reduce, or avoid, environmental damage; (3) prevent environmental\n\ndamage by requiring project changes via alternatives or mitigation measures when\n\nfeasible; and (4) disclose to the public the rationale for governmental approval of a\n\nproject that may significantly impact the environment.\" (California Building Industry\n\nAssn. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 382 (CBIA).)\n\n       CEQA primarily advances these purposes through its requirement that a state or\n\nlocal agency prepare an EIR before pursuing or approving any project falling within\n\nCEQA's scope that may have a significant impact on the environment. (§§ 21100,\n\nsubd. (a), 21151, subd. (a).) \"An [EIR] is an informational document which, when its\n\n                                            20\n\fpreparation is required . . . , shall be considered by every public agency prior to its\n\napproval or disapproval of a project.\" (§ 21061.)\n\n       \" 'If the agency's initial study of a project produces substantial evidence supporting\n\na fair argument the project may have significant adverse effects, the agency must\n\n(assuming the project is not exempt from CEQA) prepare an EIR.' \" (Save the Plastic\n\nBag Coalition v. City of Manhattan Beach (2011) 52 Cal.4th 155, 171 (Save the Plastic\n\nBag).) \"If, on the other hand, '[t]here is no substantial evidence, in light of the whole\n\nrecord . . . that the project may have a significant effect on the environment,' the agency\n\nmay adopt a negative declaration.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       A negative declaration is \"a written statement briefly describing the reasons that a\n\nproposed project will not have a significant effect on the environment and does not\n\nrequire the preparation of an environmental impact report.\" (§ 21064.) An MND is \"a\n\nnegative declaration prepared for a project when the initial study has identified\n\npotentially significant effects on the environment, but (1) revisions in the project plans or\n\nproposals made by, or agreed to by, the applicant before the proposed negative\n\ndeclaration and initial study are released for public review would avoid the effects or\n\nmitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment\n\nwould occur, and (2) there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before\n\nthe public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the\n\nenvironment.\" (§ 21064.5.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f                                                II\n\n                           Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n       \"The exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine 'bars the pursuit of a judicial\n\nremedy by a person to whom administrative action was available for the purpose of\n\nenforcing the right he seeks to assert in court, but who has failed to commence such\n\naction and is attempting to obtain judicial redress where no administrative proceeding has\n\noccurred at all; it also operates as a defense to litigation commenced by persons who have\n\nbeen aggrieved by action taken in an administrative proceeding which has in fact\n\noccurred but who have failed to \"exhaust\" the remedy available to them in the course of\n\nthe proceeding itself. [Citation.] As our Supreme Court has stated it: 'In brief, the rule is\n\nthat where an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from\n\nthe administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act.' [Citation.]\n\nThe rule is a jurisdictional prerequisite in the sense that it 'is not a matter of judicial\n\ndiscretion, but is a fundamental rule of procedure laid down by courts of last resort,\n\nfollowed under the doctrine of stare decisis, and binding upon all courts.' \" (Citizens for\n\nOpen Government v. City of Lodi (2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 874 (Citizens for Open\n\nGovernment).)\n\n       For example, if the administrative proceeding includes a right to appeal an\n\nallegedly improper action, a plaintiff must generally pursue that administrative appeal in\n\norder to exhaust his or her administrative remedies. \" 'If some reasonable administrative\n\nremedy, such as the right to appeal the action of a planning commission, were afforded to\n\nchallenge such improper action the doctrine of administrative remedies would bar suit by\n\n                                               22\n\flitigants who failed to employ it.' \" (Tahoe Vista Concerned Citizens v. County of Placer\n\n(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 577, 590 (Tahoe Vista); see Sea & Sage Audubon Society, Inc. v.\n\nPlanning Com. (1983) 34 Cal.3d 412, 417-418.) 3\n\n       Because this exhaustion requirement depends on the availability of a remedy\n\nwithin the administrative proceeding, we must examine the procedures applicable to the\n\nproceeding. \" 'Consideration of whether such exhaustion has occurred in a given case\n\nwill depend upon the procedures applicable to the public agency in question.' \" (Tahoe\n\nVista, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 591.)\n\n       \"We apply a de novo standard of review to the legal question of whether the\n\ndoctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies applies in a given case.\" (Citizens for\n\nOpen Government, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 873.) We likewise review de novo the\n\ntrial court's interpretation of the applicable provisions of the SDMC. (Save Our Heritage\n\nOrganisation v. City of San Diego (2015) 237 Cal.App.4th 163, 174.)\n\n\n\n3       This exhaustion requirement is separate from, and in addition to, the requirements\nunder CEQA that (1) any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA must be presented to\nthe public agency before its decision and (2) a prospective plaintiff must object to\napproval of the project in order to have standing to seek judicial remedies. (§ 21177,\nsubds. (a) & (b).) Cal Coast and the City proffer defenses based on these requirements as\nwell, but we need not consider them because we reject CLL's contentions on the merits in\nthe following sections. Although courts have described section 21177 as \"codif[ying] the\ndoctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies for CEQA\" (Citizens for Open\nGovernment, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 875), it does not cover every circumstance\nwhere the doctrine applies. (See Tahoe Vista, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 590\n[\"Notwithstanding the Legislature's expressed intent, section 21177 is not properly\nspeaking an exhaustion of administrative remedies statute.\"].) Section 21177 does not\napply here, for example, where the plaintiff raises a ground for noncompliance before a\npublic agency's decision but does not pursue available administrative procedures to\nchallenge that decision.\n                                            23\n\f       As noted, the City has established five \"decision processes\" to handle applications\n\nfor permits, maps, and other planning decisions. (SDMC, § 112.0501.) The City applied\n\nits \"Process Three\" to Cal Coast's application. Under Process Three, an application may\n\nbe approved, conditionally approved, or denied by a hearing officer at a public hearing.\n\n(Id., § 112.0505.) The hearing officer must comply with CEQA's environmental review\n\nand certify or adopt the appropriate environmental document (e.g., negative declaration,\n\nMND, or EIR). (Id., § 128.0311, subd. (a).) The hearing officer's decision may be\n\nappealed to the Planning Commission within 10 business days by filing an application\n\nwith the City Manager. (Id., § 112.0506.) The Planning Commission may affirm,\n\nreverse, or modify the decision being appealed. (Id., § 112.0506, subd. (f).)\n\n       The SDMC contains a separate section describing the procedure for environmental\n\ndetermination appeals. (SDMC, § 112.0520.) The SDMC defines an \"environmental\n\ndetermination\" as \"a decision by any non-elected City decisionmaker, to certify an\n\nenvironmental impact report, adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative\n\ndeclaration, or to determine that a project is exempt from [CEQA] . . . .\" (Id.,\n\n§ 113.0103.) The procedure for environmental determination appeals applies regardless\n\nof the decision process adopted by the City: \"Notwithstanding other provisions of this\n\nCode, any person may appeal an environmental determination not made by the City\n\nCouncil.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (a), italics omitted.) An environmental determination\n\nappeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 10 business days of either \"the date of\n\nposting of the Notice of Right to Appeal Environmental Determination\" or \"the date of a\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fdecision by a Hearing Officer or the Planning Commission to adopt or certify an\n\nenvironmental document.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (b).)\n\n       The City Council may grant or deny the appeal. (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e).) If the\n\nCity Council denies the appeal, it will \"approve the environmental determination and\n\nadopt the CEQA findings and statement of overriding considerations of the previous\n\ndecision-maker, where appropriate.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e)(2), italics omitted.) If\n\nthe City Council grants the appeal, it will set aside the environmental determination and\n\nreturn it to City staff for reconsideration. (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e)(2), (f)(2).) \"The\n\nPlanning Director shall reconsider the environmental determination . . . and prepare a\n\nrevised environmental document as appropriate, in consideration of any direction from\n\nthe City Council.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (f)(2), italics omitted.) During this time, \"[t]he\n\nlower decision-maker's decision to approve the project shall be held in abeyance. The\n\nCity Council shall retain jurisdiction to act on the revised environmental document and\n\nassociated project at a subsequent public hearing.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (f)(1).)\n\n       At the subsequent hearing, the City Council has the power to consider the revised\n\nenvironmental document and the associated project. \"At a subsequent hearing, the City\n\nCouncil shall again consider the environmental determination and associated projects,\n\nand may take action as follows: [¶] (A) Certify or adopt the environmental document;\n\nadopt CEQA findings and statement of overriding considerations as appropriate; and\n\naffirm the previous decision to approve the associated project; [¶] (B) Certify or adopt\n\nthe environmental document; adopt CEQA findings and statement of overriding\n\nconsiderations as appropriate; condition and approve the associated project as modified;\n\n                                              25\n\for [¶] (C) Find that the environmental document is insufficient, in which case the\n\ndocument shall not be certified. The associated project shall be denied and the decision\n\nshall be deemed the final administrative action.\" (SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (f)(3), italics\n\nomitted.)\n\n       Taken together, these provisions establish a bifurcated appeals procedure for\n\nProcess Three decisions made by a hearing officer. While a hearing officer's \"decision\"\n\nmay be appealed to the Planning Commission within 10 business days (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0506, subd. (b)), any environmental determination by the hearing officer must\n\nsimultaneously be appealed to the City Council within the same period (id., § 112.0520,\n\nsubd. (b)(2)). As a result of this bifurcation, an appeal to the Planning Commission\n\ncovers only the nonenvironmental project approvals (e.g., permits), while an appeal to the\n\nCity Council covers the environmental determination. If the City Council grants the\n\nappeal, however, it may consider the non-environmental project approvals as well.\n\n       The sequencing and interaction of these two appeals is unclear, but we need not\n\ndelve further into City procedure in order to resolve the dispute before us. CLL filed\n\nonly an appeal of the hearing officer's decision to the Planning Commission. It did not\n\nfile an appeal of the hearing officer's environmental determination. It therefore did not\n\navail itself of the City's administrative appeals procedure that was available to address\n\nCLL's objections to the hearing officer's adoption of the MND. CLL did not exhaust its\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fadministrative remedies regarding the MND, and it may not now bring a judicial action\n\nchallenging it. (See Tahoe Vista, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.) 4\n\n       CLL argues its failure to appeal the hearing officer's environmental determination\n\nis excused because the City's bifurcated appeal procedures are invalid under CEQA. (See\n\nCalifornia Clean Energy Committee v. City of San Jose (2013) 220 Cal.App.4th 1325,\n\n1346 (California Clean Energy).) CEQA requires the person or persons responsible for\n\napproving a project (the \"decisionmaking body\" in CEQA parlance) also be responsible\n\nfor complying with CEQA's environmental review (e.g., by certifying an EIR, adopting a\n\nnegative declaration or MND, or determining that the project is exempt). (See\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15025, subd. (b), 15356.) Assuming authority is properly delegated\n\nwithin the public agency, the decisionmaking body may be an unelected official or\n\ncommission. (California Clean Energy, at p. 1336 & fn. 3.) If the decisionmaking body\n\nis unelected, however, the decisionmaking body's compliance with CEQA must be\n\nappealable to the agency's elected decisionmaking body, if any. (§ 21151, subd. (c);\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15061, subd. (e), 15074, subd. (f), 15090, subd. (b).)\n\n\n\n\n4      CLL claims that its appeal from the Planning Commission's decision was\nsufficient to appeal the environmental determination to the City Council. CLL relies on\nthe SDMC provision governing the timing of environmental determination appeals,\nwhich must be filed \"[w]ithin 10 business days from the date of a decision by a Hearing\nOfficer or the Planning Commission to adopt or certify an environmental document.\"\n(SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (b), italics added.) But, under the City's Process Three, it was\nthe hearing officer who adopted the environmental document, not the Planning\nCommission. CLL therefore had 10 business days from the hearing officer's decision to\nappeal the environmental determination. The later Planning Commission decision on\nnonenvironmental matters did not reset the time to appeal.\n                                            27\n\f       The City's procedure, at least as relevant here, complies with these requirements.\n\nUnder Process Three, the hearing officer has the authority to approve the project and\n\ncomply with CEQA's environmental review. (SDMC, §§ 112.0505, 128.0311, subd. (a).)\n\nThe hearing officer is therefore the City's decisionmaking body under the Guidelines.\n\nAnd, because the hearing officer is unelected, the City's procedures allow an appeal of the\n\nhearing officer's environmental determination to the City's elected City Council. (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0520.) CLL simply did not avail itself of that procedure.\n\n       CLL relies on California Clean Energy, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th 1325, but it is\n\ninapposite. In that case, the local agency had delegated the authority to comply with\n\nCEQA's environmental review to its planning commission. (Id. at p. 1337.) This\n\ndelegation was improper because the planning commission did not have the authority to\n\napprove the project at issue. (Id. at pp. 1338, 1340.) The planning commission's\n\npurported certification of a final EIR for the project was therefore unauthorized by\n\nCEQA, and the plaintiff's challenge to that certification was not barred by its failure to\n\nappeal the planning commission's environmental decision. (Id. at p. 1346.) Here, the\n\nhearing officer's adoption of an MND for the project was procedurally proper, since the\n\nhearing officer also had the authority to approve the project. California Clean Energy\n\ndoes not apply.\n\n       The other authorities CLL cites confirm that the hearing officer's adoption of the\n\nMND was procedurally proper because he was the City's decisionmaking body for the\n\nproject.

City of Glendale (1976) 56\n\nCal.App.3d 770, 778 [\"The state guidelines require that the decision-making body or\n\nadministrative official having final approval authority over a project involving a\n\nsubstantial effect upon the environment review and consider an EIR before taking action\n\nto approve or disapprove the project.\"]; see also El Morro Community Assn. v. California\n\nDept. of Parks & Recreation (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1341, 1349-1350 [\"Guidelines,\n\nsection 15356 specifically defines the '[decisionmaking] body' as 'any person or group of\n\npeople within a public agency permitted by law to approve or disapprove the project at\n\nissue.' \"].) The City's procedure establishing an appeal to the City Council to challenge\n\nthe hearing officer's adoption of the MND was likewise proper. (See Vedanta Society of\n\nSo. California v. California Quartet, Ltd. (2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 517, 527-528.) CLL\n\nwas required to pursue this appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n\n       CLL argues that the City's appeal procedures are inadequate because the Planning\n\nCommission has authority over project approvals but not the environmental\n\ndetermination. But this alleged inadequacy does not affect the validity of the hearing\n\nofficer's environmental determination, so it provides no excuse for CLL's failure to\n\nappeal that determination. (Cf. California Clean Energy, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1346.) In addition, it is unclear on the current record which procedure would have\n\napplied had CLL properly appealed the environmental determination. During the first\n\nPlanning Commission meeting below, a deputy city attorney told the commissioners,\n\n                                            29\n\f\"Had [the appropriate box] been checked, this appeal would be set before the City\n\nCouncil and would not be heard before this body.\"\n\n       CLL also argues the City Council is not a \"decisionmaking body\" because project\n\napproval under Process Three progresses from the hearing officer to the Planning\n\nCommission. (SDMC, § 112.0506.) No independent appeal to the City Council, separate\n\nfrom an environmental determination, is authorized. (Ibid.) The Planning Commission's\n\ndecision is final. In CLL's view, the City Council is therefore not a \"person or group of\n\npeople within a public agency permitted by law to approve or disapprove the project at\n\nissue.\" (Guidelines, § 15356.) If the City grants the environmental determination appeal,\n\nhowever, it has such authority. (SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (f).) Neither CEQA nor the\n\nGuidelines require that a local agency's elected decisionmaking body accept appeals\n\nregarding every project approval, separate and apart from environmental review. They\n\nrequire only that the environmental determination be appealable. (§ 21151, subd. (c);\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15061, subd. (e), 15074, subd. (f), 15090, subd. (b).) The City's\n\nprocedures allow exactly that.\n\n       CLL further claims its failure to appeal should be excused based on inaccurate\n\ndescriptions of the City's appeal process in the public hearing notice for Cal Coast's\n\nproject and the City's Information Bulletin 505. The public hearing notice misstated the\n\nprocedure for an environmental determination appeal by implying that the appeal should\n\noccur after the Planning Commission considered the project: \"The adoption of [an MND]\n\nmay be appealed to the City Council after all other appeal rights have been exhausted.\n\nAll such appeals must be filed by 5:00 PM within ten (10) business days from the date of\n\n                                             30\n\fthe Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the environmental document.\"\n\nUnder the SDMC, the appeal to City Council for a Process Three project does not occur\n\n\"after all other appeal rights have been exhausted;\" it occurs simultaneously with the\n\nappeal to the Planning Commission. And, while the notice's reference to an appeal\n\n\"within ten (10) business days of the Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the\n\nenvironmental document\" may be applicable to other projects (see, e.g., SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0507 [describing the City's Process Four]), it is not accurate under the Process\n\nThree procedures the City applied to this project because the time to appeal ran from the\n\nhearing officer's adoption of the environmental document. The City's information\n\nbulletin, which was referenced in the public hearing notice, states that appeals must be\n\nmade in accordance with the SDMC and does not describe the specific procedures, except\n\nto state, \"Appeals of Environmental Determinations may be made after all project appeal\n\nrights have been exhausted.\" Again, this statement incorrectly describes the sequencing\n\nof the project and environmental determination appeals under Process Three, which must\n\nbe pursued simultaneously.\n\n       CLL primarily frames its argument based on these inaccuracies as one of improper\n\nnotice under CEQA. This framing does not fit the facts here. The authorities CLL cites\n\ndiscuss the failure to comply with CEQA's requirement that an \"alleged grounds for\n\nnoncompliance\" with CEQA be presented to a public agency under section 21177,\n\nsubdivision (a). (See Temecula Band of Luiseno Mission Indians v. Rancho Cal. Water\n\nDist. (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 425, 433-435 (Temecula Band); McQueen v. Board of\n\nDirectors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1150-1151 (McQueen).) This requirement \"does\n\n                                            31\n\fnot apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there\n\nwas no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those\n\nobjections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project, or if the public agency\n\nfailed to give the notice required by law.\" (§ 21177, subd. (e).) In McQueen, the court\n\nheld that an inaccurate and misleading project description is \"tantamount to a lack of\n\nnotice\" under CEQA, thus excusing the plaintiff's failure to raise a noncompliance issue\n\nearly in the public agency's consideration of the project. (McQueen, supra, at p. 1150.)\n\nTemecula Band agreed with McQueen's interpretation of the statute, but it distinguished\n\nMcQueen on the facts. (Temecula Band, supra, at p. 434.) While the project description\n\nwas inaccurate and misleading, as in McQueen, the project was clarified at a subsequent\n\npublic hearing. (Ibid.) The plaintiff failed to object after that clarification, despite an\n\nopportunity to do so, and therefore its failure to raise a noncompliance issue was not\n\nexcused. (Ibid.)\n\n       CLL's failure to appeal is not a failure to raise a noncompliance issue under\n\nsection 21177. McQueen and Temecula Band therefore have little relevance to the\n\nadministrative exhaustion issue here. And, even taken on their own terms, these\n\nauthorities stand only for the proposition that a plaintiff should be excused from failing to\n\nraise a noncompliance issue where a misleading project description—or complete lack of\n\nnotice—has misled a plaintiff into believing there is no noncompliance issue at all.\n\n(§ 21177, subd. (e); Temecula Band, supra, 43 Cal.App.4th at p. 434.) It does not apply\n\nwhere the public agency has accurately provided notice of a public hearing, but it\n\nmisstates the applicable procedures to appeal the decision made at that hearing.\n\n                                              32\n\f         Instead, a plaintiff's remedy in this situation is to prevent the public agency from\n\ninvoking an administrative exhaustion defense through equitable estoppel. (See Shuer v.\n\nCounty of San Diego (2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 476, 487 [\"We find, however, that the sum\n\ntotal of county's actions . . . negligently led [the plaintiff] to conclude that she had no\n\nadministrative recourse. That being the case, county is estopped from asserting in its\n\ndemurrer that [the plaintiff] failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.\"]; see also\n\nFeduniak v. California Coastal Com. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1372 [\"[C]ourts will\n\nnot hesitate to estop the government from asserting a procedural barrier, such as the\n\nstatute of limitations or a failure to exhaust remedies, as a defense to claims against it,\n\nwhere the government's affirmative conduct caused the claimant's failure to comply with\n\nthe procedural requirement.\"]; J.H.

CLL pursued a claim for equitable estoppel in the trial court, but it was\n\nunsuccessful. CLL has not raised any claim of error regarding equitable estoppel in this\n\ncourt. Its failure to exhaust administrative remedies therefore may not be excused on that\n\nbasis.\n\n                                               III\n\n                                     Adoption of the MND\n\n         Although we have found that CLL failed to exhaust its administrative remedies\n\nregarding the City's adoption of an MND for the project, we will nonetheless consider\n\n                                               33\n\fCLL's substantive arguments as an alternative ground for our decision. CLL primarily\n\nargues the hearing officer should not have adopted the MND because the record\n\ndemonstrated a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the\n\nenvironment that would not be mitigated. CLL contends the City was therefore required\n\nto prepare an EIR for the project.\n\n       An EIR must be prepared \"[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole\n\nrecord before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the\n\nenvironment . . . .\" (§ 21080, subd. (d).) \" 'May' means a reasonable possibility.\"\n\n(Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927 (Pocket\n\nProtectors).)\n\n       \" 'Environment' means the physical conditions which exist within the area which\n\nwill be affected by a proposed project, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna,\n\nnoise, objects of historic or aesthetic significance.\" (§ 21060.5.) \" 'Significant effect on\n\nthe environment' means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the\n\nenvironment.\" (§ 21068.) \"An economic or social change by itself shall not be\n\nconsidered a significant effect on the environment. A social or economic change related\n\nto a physical change may be considered in determining whether the physical change is\n\nsignificant.\" (Guidelines, § 15382; see § 21082.2, subd. (c).)\n\n       \"[S]ubstantial evidence includes fact, a reasonable assumption predicated upon\n\nfact, or expert opinion supported by fact.\" (§ 21080, subd. (e)(1).) \"Substantial evidence\n\nis not argument, speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence that is clearly\n\ninaccurate or erroneous, or evidence of social or economic impacts that do not contribute\n\n                                             34\n\fto, or are not caused by, physical impacts on the environment.\" (§ 21080, subd. (e)(2).)\n\n\"The existence of public controversy over the environmental effects of a project shall not\n\nrequire preparation of an environmental impact report if there is no substantial evidence\n\nin light of the whole record before the lead agency that the project may have a significant\n\neffect on the environment.\" (§ 21082.2, subd. (b).) \"Relevant personal observations of\n\narea residents on nontechnical subjects may qualify as substantial evidence . . . .\n\n[Citations.] So may expert opinion if supported by facts, even if not based on specific\n\nobservations as to the site under review.\" (Pocket Protectors, supra, 124 Cal.App.4th at\n\np. 928.)\n\n       The agency does not weigh the potential effect on the environment if substantial\n\nevidence supports both the preparation of an EIR and the opposite. \"[I]f a lead agency is\n\npresented with a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the\n\nenvironment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may also be presented\n\nwith other substantial evidence that the project will not have a significant effect.\"\n\n(Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (f)(1); see No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13\n\nCal.3d 68, 75.) For example, \"[i]f there is disagreement among expert opinion supported\n\nby facts over the significance of an effect on the environment, the Lead Agency shall\n\ntreat the effect as significant and shall prepare an EIR.\" (Guidelines, § 15064, subd.

City of Poway (2016) 245 Cal.App.4th 560, 576.)\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\f       The hearing officer's \"decision to issue a negative declaration in connection with\n\n[the project] is reviewed for 'prejudicial abuse of discretion,' which 'is established if the\n\nagency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision\n\nis not supported by substantial evidence.' \" (Save the Plastic Bag, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\n\np. 171, quoting § 21168.5.) \" 'In reviewing the adoption of [a negative declaration], our\n\ntask is to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record supporting a fair\n\nargument that the Project will significantly impact the environment; if there is, it was an\n\nabuse of discretion not to require an EIR.

County of San Bernardino (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 677, 684\n\n(Joshua Tree).)\n\n       As the appellant, CLL bears the burden of identifying in the record substantial\n\nevidence of a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the\n\nenvironment that would not be mitigated. (See Citizens for Responsible and Open\n\nGovernment v. City of Grand Terrace (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1332.) CLL\n\ncontends the project may have significant effects in the areas of fire hazards, traffic and\n\ntransportation, noise, recreation, and historical resources.\n\n       For reasons we will explain, CLL has not made a sufficient showing here. The\n\nproject at issue is relatively modest and located on already-developed land. The record\n\ndoes not reflect any fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the\n\n                                              36\n\fenvironment that would not be mitigated. We will address each of the areas CLL\n\nidentifies in turn. 5\n\n                                       Fire Hazards\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment by increasing the risk\n\nof fire hazards, including wildfires. Here, however, CLL has not shown the project\n\nwould have any significant effect on fire hazards in the area. The project meets all\n\napplicable fire codes, the project site is already developed, and CLL's large commercial\n\nhorse ranch already operates on the neighboring parcel. The area already sees vehicular\n\nand pedestrian traffic. CLL has not shown any of the project's activities have a\n\nreasonable possibility of significantly increasing the risk of fire hazards. Indeed, by\n\nincorporating a new water line and fire hydrant, the project appears to increase fire safety\n\nin the area.\n\n       CLL focuses on the location of the project in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity\n\nZone (see Gov. Code, § 51178) and the risk to persons and property from potential\n\nwildfires in the area. CLL's focus is misplaced. As our Supreme Court has explained,\n\n\"we must distinguish between requirements that consider the environment's effects on a\n\nproject and those that contemplate the project's impacts on the existing environment.\"\n\n(CBIA, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 388.) Only the latter impacts are valid under CEQA. It is\n\n\n\n5     CLL's opening brief presents its argument that there was substantial evidence in\nchronological order, identifying in turn bits of evidence in the City's initial study,\ncomments to the draft and final MND, and testimony before the hearing officer and at the\nPlanning Commission. Presenting this information chronologically, rather than by topic,\nmakes our review of CLL's argument more difficult and lessens its persuasive value.\n                                             37\n\fproper to evaluate \"a project's potentially significant exacerbating effects on existing\n\nenvironmental hazards—effects that arise because the project brings 'development and\n\npeople into the area affected.' \" (Ibid.) But considering existing environmental hazards,\n\nunchanged by the project, are not proper under CEQA. \"CEQA generally does not\n\nrequire an analysis of how existing environmental conditions will impact a project's\n\nfuture users or residents.\" (Id. at p. 386.) 6\n\n       CLL argues the project will inhibit the ability of people and, at the ranch, animals\n\nto evacuate in the event of a wildfire. CLL points to the alleged \"inability to timely and\n\nsafely evacuate 95 school personnel and students in conjunction with [CLL's] 135 horses\n\nand 15 cattle, ranch personnel, clients and trailers through the narrow Clews Ranch\n\nRoad.\" But Clews Ranch Road is 20 feet wide and only 1,650 feet long. Complaints\n\nabout its inadequacy are speculative. The project will also have an alternate evacuation\n\nroute westward along a dirt road, and it intends to operate only part of the year and will\n\nclose on red flag warning days. The inherent difficulty in evacuating \"135 horses and 15\n\ncattle, ranch personnel, clients and trailers\" already exists and will not be significantly\n\naffected by the project. Viewing the record as a whole, there is no fair argument that the\n\nproject will materially affect evacuation routes in the area.\n\n       CLL relies on the comments submitted by its fire safety expert, Van\n\nCollingsworth. His comments consist largely of general observations regarding fire\n\n\n6      CEQA provides for exceptions to this general rule in certain specific contexts,\nincluding school construction projects near hazardous waste disposal sites or freeways.\n(§ 21151.8, subd. (a)(3)(B); see CBIA, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 391.) Very High Fire\nHazard Severity Zones are not included.\n                                                 38\n\fhazards not tied to the project, questions about the project, and topics allegedly\n\nunaddressed or inadequately addressed in the MND and project materials. His general\n\nobservations cannot, in and of themselves, create a fair argument without some nexus\n\nwith the project itself. His questions about the project and the topics allegedly\n\nunaddressed or inadequately addressed also cannot create a fair argument without some\n\nshowing that those questions and topics refer to a potentially significant effect on the\n\nenvironment that the project may create. Collingsworth also focuses on the effect of the\n\nenvironment on the project (students and faculty at the school), rather than the effect of\n\nthe project on the environment, which is incorrect for the reasons we have already\n\ndiscussed. Collingsworth's remaining comments are conclusory, speculative, or\n\notherwise unsupported. They are likewise insufficient.\n\n       CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the project's effect on the fire\n\nhazards in the environment, including as a consequence of bringing additional people into\n\nthe area, may be significant. The City therefore was not required to prepare an EIR on\n\nthis basis.\n\n                                Traffic and Transportation\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment by increasing traffic or\n\nimpeding transportation. Various comments from the public argued the project here\n\nwould create an unreasonable traffic situation on Clews Ranch Road. They claimed that\n\nthe road could not support the estimated 117 additional daily trips caused by the project\n\nbecause the road was narrow, \"may create conflicts for two-way traffic,\" and was used by\n\npedestrians and horses as well. Barbara Clews and others contended that there were also\n\n                                             39\n\f\"blind corners\" on the road. As to the last comment, it appears contradicted by the actual\n\ncondition of the road, which is only 1,650 feet long and largely straight. On direct issues\n\nof credibility, we must defer to the hearing officer. (See Joshua Tree, supra, 1\n\nCal.App.5th at p. 684.) The remaining comments are insufficient to create a fair\n\nargument that the project may have a significant impact on traffic and transportation.\n\nClews Ranch Road was 20 feet wide and allowed two-way traffic. It had supported\n\ntraffic to and from CLL's large commercial horse ranch and the project site, including\n\nduring special events, without incident.\n\n       The factual situation here is far different from the situation in Keep Our\n\nMountains Quiet v. County of Santa Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714, which CLL cites.\n\nIn that case, an initial report by the California Department of Transportation found there\n\nwould be \" 'significant impacts to the operations and traffic movements to the site\n\nentrances' and 'might impede [Summit Road] in both directions because of numerous\n\nvehicles making right and left-turns into the site.' \" (Id. at p. 725.) The road leading to\n\nthe project site was winding and very narrow (under 10 feet at one point), with 39 blind\n\ncurves. (Id. at p. 727.) The accident rate was twice the statewide average. (Id. at pp.\n\n726-727.) No such facts were developed here.\n\n       The commenters' predictions of significant impacts alone are insufficient absent\n\nspecific facts in the record supporting a fair argument. \" '[I]n the absence of a specific\n\nfactual foundation in the record, dire predictions by nonexperts regarding the\n\nconsequences of a project do not constitute substantial evidence.' \" (Joshua Tree, supra,\n\n1 Cal.App.5th at p. 690.) CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the\n\n                                             40\n\fproject's effect on traffic and transportation may be significant. The City was not\n\nrequired to prepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                            Noise\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment through the noise it\n\ngenerates. (See Oro Fino Gold Mining Corp. v. County of El Dorado (1990) 225\n\nCal.App.3d 872, 882 [noise generated by gold mine's drilling rig].) Several commenters\n\nassociated with CLL's horse ranch predicted significant noise impacts because noises\n\nfrom school activities could disrupt ranch operations. For example, one commenter\n\ndescribed incidents in which construction noise at the project site had frightened horses\n\nand caused them to throw their riders. But the possibility that noise will impact the horse\n\nranch's operations is insufficient. \"Under CEQA, the question is whether a project will\n\naffect the environment of persons in general, not whether a project will affect particular\n\npersons.\" (Mira Mar Mobile Community v. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th\n\n477, 492.) The noise likely generated by the school (children laughing and playing, cars\n\ndriving, doors closing, etc.) is insignificant in the context of the environment as a whole,\n\nespecially given the project's location near a busy highway, State Route 56, and CLL's\n\nlarge ranch.\n\n       Even if the noise generated by the school adversely impacted the ability of the\n\nranch to continue operation as a viable business, the impact on the ranch alone would be\n\ninsufficient to support preparation of an EIR. The fact that a project may affect another\n\nbusiness's economic viability is not an effect covered by CEQA unless it results in a\n\nchange in the physical environment (e.g., urban decay). (Joshua Tree, supra, 1\n\n                                             41\n\fCal.App.5th at p. 685.) CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the project's\n\neffect on noise in the environment may be significant. The City was not required to\n\nprepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                         Recreation\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment if it reduces available\n\nrecreation activities. The project here will use a public parking lot serving nearby trails\n\nas a pick-up and drop-off point for its shuttles. Commenters believed the school's use of\n\nthe parking lot would leave little room for other users. For example, the CVCPB\n\nexpressed concern that \"[u]nresolved operational issues such as the drop-off and pickup\n\nlocation may impact traffic flow on Carmel Country Road and [the location] may be\n\ninadequate for the added use beyond much needed parking for the heavily used CVREP\n\npublic trails.\" Speculation by commenters such as the CVCPB is not substantial\n\nevidence, and it is insufficient to support a fair argument that the project may have a\n\nsignificant impact on recreation. (Joshua Tree, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 690.) CLL has\n\nnot shown the City was required to prepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                   Historical Resources\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment if it affects historical\n\nresources. The project here would not alter the historic farmhouse on the site or its\n\noutbuildings, and the architecture of the new school on the property is consistent with the\n\nfarmhouse's aesthetic. CLL claims the City should have undertaken additional study of\n\nthe project's impact on the broader Mount Carmel Ranch historical resource, but such\n\ncriticism is mere rhetoric without facts supporting such an impact. CLL has not shown\n\n                                             42\n\fthat there is a fair argument that the project's effect on historical resources may be\n\nsignificant. The City was not required to prepare an EIR on this basis. We will address\n\nthe City's compliance with its historical resource regulations in part IV, post.\n\n                                              IV\n\n                                 Recirculation of the MND\n\n       To achieve the public notice purposes of CEQA, an MND must be recirculated if\n\nit is substantially revised after its release but prior to adoption. (Guidelines, § 15073.5,\n\nsubd. (a).) A substantial revision includes the circumstances where \"[a] new, avoidable\n\nsignificant effect is identified and mitigation measures or project revisions must be added\n\nin order to reduce the effect to insignificance,\" or \"[t]he lead agency determines that the\n\nproposed mitigation measures or project revisions will not reduce potential effects to less\n\nthan significance and new measures or revisions must be required.\" (Guidelines,\n\n§ 15073.5, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) Recirculation is not required where \"[n]ew project revisions\n\nare added in response to written or verbal comments on the project's effects identified in\n\nthe proposed negative declaration which are not new avoidable significant effects\";\n\n\"[m]easures or conditions of project approval are added after circulation of the negative\n\ndeclaration which are not required by CEQA, which do not create new significant\n\nenvironmental effects and are not necessary to mitigate an avoidable significant effect\";\n\nor \"[n]ew information is added to the negative declaration which merely clarifies,\n\namplifies, or makes insignificant modifications to the negative declaration.\" (Guidelines,\n\n§ 15073.5, subd. (c)(2)-(4).)\n\n\n\n                                              43\n\f       CLL contends the school's shuttle bus plan and its intent to close on red flag\n\nwarning days, which were added to the project after the MND was circulated, constitute\n\nnew mitigation measures that required recirculation. We disagree. These plans were\n\npurely voluntary, so they cannot constitute mitigation measures. (Guidelines, § 15126.4,\n\nsubd. (a)(2).) And CLL has not shown they were added to the project to reduce\n\nsignificant effects on the environment for the reasons discussed above. Moreover,\n\nadditional information about the project's design and layout, its evacuation plan, and its\n\nbrush management plan, which were also added after circulation, were clarifying and\n\namplifying in nature and did not make substantial revisions to the project. (See\n\nGuidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (c)(4).) Recirculation was not required.\n\n                                              V\n\n                              Historical Resource Regulations\n\n       CLL contends the City failed to follow its historical resource regulations (SDMC,\n\n§ 143.0201 et seq.) and the Historical Resources Guidelines of the City's Land\n\nDevelopment Manual (HRG). To succeed, CLL must establish a prejudicial abuse of\n\ndiscretion, i.e., it must show that the City's actions were \"arbitrary, capricious, in excess\n\nof its jurisdiction, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or without reasonable or\n\nrational basis as a matter of law.\" (Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121\n\nCal.App.4th 1490, 1497 (Sierra Club).) \"A prejudicial abuse of discretion is established\n\nif the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, if its decision is not\n\nsupported by findings, or if its findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the\n\nrecord.\" (Ibid.; see § 21168.5)\n\n                                              44\n\f       CLL advances two interrelated arguments in an attempt to show the City did not\n\nproceed as required by law: (1) the historical resource regulations require the City to\n\napply its \"Process Four\" to the project, which would involve review by the City's\n\nHistorical Resources Board, and (2) the regulations require the City to analyze the effect\n\nof the project on Mount Carmel Ranch, the broader historical resource of which the\n\nproject site's historic farmhouse is a part.\n\n       The City's historical resource regulations apply whenever historical resources,\n\nincluding designated historical resources, are present at a project site. (SDMC,\n\n§ 143.0210, subd. (a)(1).) The City must proceed under Process Four for certain types of\n\ndevelopment when a designated historical resource is present. (Id., § 126.0502, subd.\n\n(d)(1).) The types of development that require Process Four are subdivisions, single or\n\nmultiple unit residential developments, commercial or industrial developments, public\n\nworks projects, and any developments that deviate from the historical resources\n\nregulations. (Ibid.) The historical resources regulations similarly require Process Four\n\nfor subdivisions, single or multiple unit residential developments, commercial or\n\nindustrial developments, public works projects (other than capital improvement program\n\nprojects), land use plans, and any developments that deviate from the historical resources\n\nregulations (other than capital improvement program projects). (Id., § 143.0210, subd.\n\n(e)(2).)\n\n       Even if these requirements apply, the historical resource regulations contain\n\ncertain exemptions. (SDMC, § 143.0220; see id., §§ 126.0502, subd. (d)(1), 143.0210,\n\nsubd. (e).) One of these exemptions covers \"[a]ny development that proposes minor\n\n                                               45\n\falterations or improvements consistent with [SDMC] Section 143.0250, subdivision (a),\n\nto a designated historical resource, or any historical building or historical structure\n\nlocated within a historical district, or any new construction within a historical district that\n\nwill enhance, restore, maintain, repair, or allow adaptive reuse of the resource and which\n\nwill not adversely affect the special character or special historical, architectural,\n\narchaeological, or cultural value of the resource when all feasible measures to protect and\n\npreserve the historical resource are included in the development proposal consistent with\n\nthe Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines.\" (Id., § 143.0220, subd. (a), italics\n\nomitted.)\n\n         In the report to the Planning Commission for the project, City staff explained that\n\nthe project falls within this exemption because it is new construction that is consistent\n\nwith the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines, the HRG, and the historical\n\nresource regulations. In arguing that Process Four applies, CLL does not address the\n\nsubstance of this exemption. It merely criticizes the City's reliance on the exemption as a\n\npost hoc rationalization. Such criticism is insufficient without a showing that Process\n\nFour should have been applied. \"The decisions of the agency are given substantial\n\ndeference and are presumed correct. The parties seeking mandamus bear the burden of\n\nproving otherwise, and the reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the\n\nadministrative findings and determination.\" (Sierra Club, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1497.)\n\n         CLL also criticizes the City for not complying with the requirements of the\n\nhistorical resource regulations and the HRG, particularly the absence of any detailed\n\n                                              46\n\fanalysis of the project's effect on the Mount Carmel Ranch, the broader historical\n\nresource of which the project site's historic farmhouse is a part, or of the project's Area of\n\nPotential Effect. Again, CLL's criticism is insufficient. Inadequate explanation\n\nregarding compliance is not the same as noncompliance. (See Sierra Club, supra, 121\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1497.)\n\n       CLL's further contention that a recommendation of the Historical Resources Board\n\nwas required is incorrect; such a recommendation is only required under Process Four.\n\n(SDMC, § 126.0504, subd. (b)(2).) And its contention that approval of Cal Coast's\n\nproject should have been handled under the same procedures as the prior approval of its\n\ncommercial horse ranch is unpersuasive. The mere fact that CLL complied with different\n\nprocedures does not show that Cal Coast should be held to those procedures. CLL has\n\nnot shown the City erred.\n\n                                             VI\n\n            Consistency with the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan\n\n       CLL argues that the project conflicts with the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8\n\nPrecise Plan (Precise Plan) adopted by the City. The Precise Plan \"provides development\n\nguidelines for the Neighborhood 8 portion of Carmel Valley, a designated community\n\nplan area within the City[.]\" \"The Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan also functions as a\n\ncomponent in the development implementation process . . . . The precise plan constitutes\n\none of a series of steps in the City approval of development projects in Neighborhood 8.\n\nThe Carmel Valley Community Plan provides guidelines, proposals and concepts for the\n\nfuture development of the entire Carmel Valley community. The precise plan is used by\n\n                                              47\n\fthe individual neighborhoods, within the larger Carmel Valley Plan context, to determine\n\nhow the specific development unit will take shape. It is the precise plan's role to address\n\nissues such as development density, road alignments and community facility sites. The\n\nadopted precise plans then become the basis for reviewing subsequent development\n\nplans, subdivisions, and other permits within their respective development units.\" While\n\nsubordinate to the City's General Plan and the Carmel Valley Community Plan, the\n\nPrecise Plan guides development in the same way for projects within its area of concern.\n\n       The most recent Precise Plan, issued in 2012, designates the project site as open\n\nspace. In their report to the hearing officer, City staff identified the site as designated\n\nnatural open space. The report explained, however, that development on the site was\n\nconsistent with the Precise Plan because the area had already been disturbed: \"The\n\nproject site has been previously disturbed by the prior construction of several concrete\n\npads void of any structures, several accessory buildings, a swimming pool and the\n\nhistoric residential structure. These improvements are or were dispersed throughout the\n\nproperty. The proposed school building is located in an area on the site which was\n\npreviously developed with a swimming pool which has since been capped and covered\n\nwith a concrete pad. New drive aisles and parking areas would be located in areas of\n\nprevious disturbance and are either covered in concrete/asphalt/gravel or are existing\n\nunpaved driveways and/or parking areas. The project design limits new development to\n\npreviously developed and disturbed areas in conformance with the Precise Plan's Open\n\nSpace policies.\" In the report to the Planning Commission following CLL's appeal, City\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\fstaff reiterated their analysis and found no inconsistency between the project and the\n\nPrecise Plan.\n\n       The site development permit issued by the Planning Commission confirms that the\n\nproject site \"is designated Open Space by the Precise Plan.\" But it explained, \"The\n\nproposed Project will be developed on previously disturbed land and will not impact or\n\ndevelop on existing undisturbed open space and [the Multi-Habitat Planning Area] land.\"\n\nIt therefore found that the project would not \"adversely affect the applicable land use\n\nplan.\" 7\n\n       Any local land use or development decision, including approval of the project at\n\nissue here, must be consistent with the applicable general plan and its constituent\n\nelements. (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th\n\n141, 153 (Orange Citizens).) We review the City's finding that the project is consistent\n\nwith the Precise Plan for abuse of discretion. (Id. at p. 154.) \"A city's determination that\n\na development approval is consistent with its general plan has been described by some\n\ncourts as 'adjudicatory' [citation] and by others as 'quasi-legislative' [citation]. Where a\n\nconsistency determination involves the application of a general plan's established land\n\nuse designation to a particular development, it is fundamentally adjudicatory. In such\n\n\n\n7       Curiously, the City and Cal Coast in their joint respondents' brief take the position\nthat the project site is not designated open space. They rely on an earlier 1990 Precise\nPlan and baldly assert that \"any later designation of the site as 'open space' would have\nbeen a factual error.\" This assertion contradicts the City's position in the approved site\ndevelopment permit and the repeated analyses of City staff. While we need not explore\nthe consequences of such inconsistency in this appeal, since an alternative ground exists\non which to reject CLL's challenge, it is troubling.\n                                              49\n\fcircumstances, a consistency determination is entitled to deference as an extension of a\n\nplanning agency's ' \"unique competence to interpret [its] policies when applying them in\n\nits adjudicatory capacity.\" ' [Citation.] Reviewing courts must defer to a procedurally\n\nproper consistency finding unless no reasonable person could have reached the same\n\nconclusion.\" (Id. at pp. 154-155.) \"The party challenging a city's determination of\n\ngeneral plan consistency has the burden to show why, based on all of the evidence in the\n\nrecord, the determination was unreasonable.\" (San Diego Citizenry Group v. County of\n\nSan Diego (2013) 219 Cal.App.4th 1, 26.)\n\n       CLL focuses on the project's site's multifamily residential (MF-1) zoning and\n\ncontends that zoning is inconsistent with an open space designation. While \"[a] zoning\n\nordinance that conflicts with a general plan is invalid at the time it is passed\" (Lesher\n\nCommunications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 544), the City's\n\nzoning decision is not at issue here. The multifamily residential zoning was implemented\n\nprior to the latest Precise Plan's open space designation. The Precise Plan contemplated a\n\nchange in the site's zoning from multifamily residential to open space, but it appears this\n\nchange has not occurred.\n\n       The issue here is whether the project is consistent with the Precise Plan's open\n\nspace designation. CLL does not persuasively address the reasoning behind the City's\n\nconsistency determination, which was based on previous development at the site. CLL\n\nreferences the general concern for open space, natural vistas, and recreation described in\n\nthe Precise Plan and similar documents, but it does not explain how the City abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that the development of the school at issue here would be consistent\n\n                                             50\n\fwith the objectives of the open space designation. (CLL's claim that the CVREP trails\n\nwould be affected by the project's use of the trailhead parking lot has been addressed and\n\nrejected above.)\n\n       The City could reasonably conclude that the project was consistent with the\n\nPrecise Plan and its open space designation because the proposed school will be built on\n\nalready developed land, next to a large commercial horse farm, and will be consistent\n\nwith the historic nature of the site. (See Orange Citizens, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 157\n\n[\" '[S]tate law does not require perfect conformity between a proposed project and the\n\napplicable general plan.' \"].) CLL's bare assertion that further evaluation was needed is\n\ninsufficient.\n\n                                            VII\n\n                            Site Development Permit Findings\n\n       CLL contends, based on its previous arguments, that the City's findings in the site\n\ndevelopment permit are not supported by the evidence. We find that contention\n\nunpersuasive for the reasons we have already discussed with respect to CLL's specific\n\narguments above.\n\n\n\n\n                                             51\n\f                                DISPOSITION\n\n    The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                              McCONNELL, P.

CLL's petition and\n\ncomplaint challenged the City's approval of a project to build a private secondary school\n\non land neighboring CLL's commercial horse ranch and equestrian facility and the City's\n\nadoption of a mitigated negative declaration (MND) regarding the project. The for-profit\n\nschool, the Cal Coast Academy, is being developed by real parties in interest Jan\n\nDunning, Cal Coast Academy RE Holdings, LLC, and the North County Center for\n\nEducational Development, Inc. (collectively, Cal Coast).\n\n       CLL contends the court erred by denying its petition and resolving its remaining\n\nclaims in favor of the City. It argues the City should not have adopted the MND because\n\nthe Cal Coast Academy project would cause significant environmental impacts in the\n\nareas of fire hazards, traffic and transportation, noise, recreation, and historical resources,\n\nand because the MND identified new impacts and mitigation measures that were not\n\nincluded in the draft MND. CLL further argues the City should not have approved the\n\nproject because it is situated in designated open space under the applicable community\n\nland use plan and because the City did not follow the provisions of the San Diego\n\nMunicipal Code (SDMC) applicable to historical resources.\n\n       The City and Cal Coast respond that CLL did not exhaust its administrative\n\nremedies because it failed to appeal the decision adopting the MND to the San Diego\n\nCity Council. On the merits, the City and Cal Coast argue the project would not cause\n\n                                               2\n\fany significant environmental impacts in the areas identified by CLL, the project is not\n\ninconsistent with the open space designation, and the City complied with the historical\n\nresources provisions of the SDMC.\n\n       For reasons we will explain, we conclude CLL's challenge to the MND is barred\n\nbecause it did not exhaust its administrative remedies in proceedings before the City. In\n\ndoing so, we reject CLL's argument that the City's process for administrative appeals—at\n\nleast as implicated by this project—violates the California Environmental Quality Act\n\n(CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) 1 by improperly splitting the adoption of\n\nan environmental document (e.g., the MND) from the project approvals. We further\n\nconclude CLL's challenge to the MND fails on its merits, even assuming CLL had\n\nexhausted its administrative remedies. Finally, we conclude the City complied with all\n\napplicable requirements of the SDMC regarding historical resources and the City's\n\napproval of the project does not conflict with the open space designation because the\n\nproject will be located on already-developed land. We therefore affirm the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Public Resources Code unless otherwise\nstated. The administrative guidelines adopted by the Secretary for Resources to\nimplement CEQA (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) will be referred to as\n\"Guidelines\" followed by the section number. \"We need not decide for purposes of this\nappeal whether the Guidelines are binding on the courts.

The school will have a\n\nmaximum enrollment of 75 students, with 18 staff members. Along with the school, the\n\nproject proposes construction of a 24-stall parking lot, landscaping, and removal of\n\ncertain existing features on the site, including a concrete-filled swimming pool.\n\n       A farmhouse at the site was built around 1900 and is a designated historical\n\nresource, part of the larger Mount Carmel Ranch (Historical Resources Board No. 391).\n\nCal Coast currently uses the farmhouse as an administrative office, and it will continue to\n\ndo so following project completion. Several older outbuildings exist at the site as well.\n\nThe project will not affect the farmhouse or outbuildings, and the school's design\n\nincorporates features intended to ensure compatibility with the historic nature of the site.\n\n       The site is adjacent to CLL's equestrian facility, the Clews Horse Ranch. The\n\nranch consists of a 45-stall parking lot, corrals, stables, riding areas, a barn, a club house,\n\nand two or three single family homes. A riding ring abuts the project site. The ranch has\n\nfacilities for over a hundred horses and a dozen cattle. Individuals come to the ranch to\n\nride or participate in other equestrian activities. The ranch also holds a popular rodeo.\n\n       The project site is situated at the end of Clews Ranch Road, a 1,650-foot private\n\ndriveway that also provides access to the ranch. It is approximately 20 feet wide and has\n\na posted speed limit of 10 miles per hour. Clews Ranch Road runs east-to-west and\n\nconnects with Carmel Country Road. At that intersection, a public parking lot serves\n\n                                               4\n\frecreational bicycle and hiking trails in the area. Clews Ranch Road is the sole vehicular\n\naccessway for both the project site and the ranch, although a dirt road runs westward\n\nfrom the site and connects with Carmel Creek Road. The project site sits on a bluff\n\nabove State Route 56, a busy divided highway. Across the highway is a developed\n\nsuburban area.\n\n       The site lies within the \"Neighborhood 8\" portion of Carmel Valley, a designated\n\ncommunity plan area within the City. Under the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise\n\nPlan, the site is designated as open space. The site is zoned residential MF-1, which\n\nallows construction of multifamily dwellings up to a density of seven to fifteen units per\n\nacre. MF-1 zoning allows \"by right\" construction of primary and secondary schools. The\n\nsite is also within the coastal zone. When the neighboring ranch was permitted in 2007,\n\nthe City changed its zoning from multifamily residential to agricultural. The ranch is also\n\ndesignated open space.\n\n                                  The City's Initial Study\n\n       Cal Coast applied to the City for the approvals necessary to develop the project.\n\nIn an initial study, City staff determined the project would not have a significant impact\n\non any environmental factors, with the exception of \"cultural resources,\" i.e.,\n\narchaeological and paleontological resources. Such resources may exist in the project\n\narea. However, City staff concluded the environmental impact would be less than\n\nsignificant if mitigation measures were adopted, including on-site monitoring during\n\ngrading activities.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       As relevant here, the initial study also assessed the project's potential impacts on\n\nhistorical resources, fire hazards, land use and planning, noise, recreation, and\n\ntransportation and traffic. The initial study identified the farmhouse as a historical\n\nresource, but it determined that the project's effects on the farmhouse would be less than\n\nsignificant because the farmhouse and outbuilding structures would be maintained and\n\nbecause the school's design was consistent with the City's historical resource regulations.\n\nAs to fire hazards, the initial study noted the project site was adjacent to native or\n\nnaturalized vegetation in the Carmel Valley River Enhancement Program (CVREP) area\n\nalong State Route 56. Based on its location, the project would be subject to brush\n\nmanagement regulations. In addition, the project's design incorporated fire resistant\n\nmaterials and tempered glass windows. Based on these factors, the initial study\n\nconcluded that the project would not \"expose people or structures to a significant risk of\n\nloss, injury or death involving wildland fires.\" As to land use, the initial study\n\ndetermined the project was compatible with the community plan and permitted by the\n\nunderlying multifamily residential zoning. As to noise, it found no environmental\n\nimpact. The initial study noted that the project would not be a \"permanent noise\n\ngenerating source\" and \"would not expose people to a substantial increase in temporary\n\nor periodic ambient noise levels.\" As to recreation, the initial study concluded the project\n\nwould have no impact on recreational resources. And as to traffic and transportation, the\n\ninitial study likewise found no impact. It determined that the project was consistent with\n\nthe community plan and underlying zoning, would not cause any permanent increase in\n\ntraffic, and would not result in inadequate emergency access.\n\n                                              6\n\f                          The Draft MND and Public Comments\n\n       Based on the initial study, City staff prepared a draft MND for the project. The\n\ndraft MND described the proposed project (albeit as \"three modular buildings\" rather\n\nthan a single building), identified the potential impact on cultural resources, and\n\ndescribed the mitigation measures Cal Coast would adopt to lessen any such impact. The\n\nCity's initial study was attached to the draft MND.\n\n       Several interested parties submitted comments in response to the draft MND. Two\n\nNative American tribes wrote regarding cultural resources. City staff responded by\n\npointing out the mitigation measures in the draft MND. The San Diego County\n\nArchaeological Society wrote to clarify the qualifications of any archaeological monitor.\n\nA consultant engaged by Cal Coast requested certain technical corrections, including\n\nchanging the description of the project from \"three modular buildings\" to \"a new single-\n\nstory building.\"\n\n       CLL submitted comments criticizing the use of an MND for the project. It\n\ncontended the City was required to prepare an Environmental Impact Report (EIR).\n\nAmong other things, CLL argued that potential impacts on historical resources, fire\n\nhazards, noise, and transportation and traffic should be studied in an EIR. CLL believed\n\nthe draft MND's treatment of historical resources was inadequate without a\n\ncomprehensive survey of the project site. It further believed the draft MND did not\n\nadequately consider the hazards to students and teachers from wildfires, especially given\n\nthe limited access to the project site. CLL contended the draft MND ignored the impact\n\nof noise on the Clews Horse Ranch and alleged the project \"create[d] a real threat to the\n\n                                              7\n\fviability of the ranch as [a] place to board and train horses.\" (A ranch creditor also wrote\n\nto complain that approval of the project would \"impair[] the ability of Clews Ranch to\n\nrealize its economic potential and therefore impairs the security of [his] loan.\") Finally,\n\nCLL argued the project's use of Clews Ranch Road would overburden the easement held\n\nby the project site over the road.\n\n       A ranch client submitted comments that echoed CLL's concerns regarding noise.\n\nThe individual noted the ranch's riding area was very close to the project site. He alleged\n\nconstruction activities at the project site had caused \"loud, unanticipated noise, or\n\nblowing plastic sheets\" that caused him and other riders to be thrown from their horses.\n\nHe further alleged that Clews Ranch Road could not handle additional traffic and had\n\nnumerous blind spots. He believed additional traffic would endanger horses and riders\n\nthat use the road. As to the latter concerns, City staff responded that the dimensions,\n\nalignment, and surfacing of the road had been reviewed by City engineering,\n\ntransportation, and fire personnel, who determined it was adequate to serve both the\n\nschool and the ranch. City staff noted Cal Coast had proposed to use a shuttle bus service\n\nto transport students to the school from the public parking lot at the intersection of Clews\n\nRanch Road and Carmel Country Road, thereby reducing traffic on Clews Ranch Road.\n\n       CLL engaged a fire safety consultant, Van Collingsworth, to submit additional\n\ncomments regarding fire hazards related to the project. Collingsworth concluded the\n\nproject had significant adverse fire safety impacts that required preparation of an EIR.\n\nHe noted the project site was within a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone and a flood\n\nplain. Collingsworth identified a large number of questions regarding fire safety that he\n\n                                              8\n\falleged went unanswered in the draft MND. These questions revolved around topics such\n\nas the project's design and construction standards, the evacuation plan for the school, first\n\nresponder response times and capabilities, and brush management guidelines.\n\nCollingsworth also provided general information regarding the vulnerability of structures\n\nand people to wildfires, the strength and intensity of expected wildfires, the impact of\n\ndrought conditions on fire behavior, and the safety of firefighters and other emergency\n\npersonnel. He expressed concern that Clews Ranch Road would be inadequate to\n\nevacuate the school in addition to the animals and people at the ranch. Finally, he\n\nasserted without citation that \"[t]raffic is already constrained and gridlocked during\n\ncommuter hours on and offsite under current conditions.\"\n\n       City staff reviewed Collingsworth's comments and did not believe he had raised\n\nany significant environmental impacts. The fire marshal had reviewed the project and\n\nfound it complied with City fire codes. Similarly, an outside consultant engaged by Cal\n\nCoast had prepared a wildfire analysis in response to Collingsworth's comments. The\n\nconsultant identified no significant impacts regarding fire safety. Cal Coast also\n\nsubmitted a brush management plan and a fire protection and emergency evacuation plan,\n\nwhich described two evacuation routes (one eastward and one westward) in the event of\n\nan emergency.\n\n       City staff identified several project design features that reduced the potential for\n\nfire hazard impacts, including fire resistant building materials, brush removal, a new\n\nwater line and fire hydrant serving the project site, and an annually reviewed evacuation\n\nplan. They described the contents of the school's evacuation plan, including exit routes\n\n                                              9\n\feast along Clews Ranch Road to Carmel Country Road and west along a dirt road to\n\nCarmel Creek Road. City staff noted the school intended to close on red flag warning\n\ndays out of an abundance of caution. For fires that might originate at the school, City\n\nstaff noted among other things that the project will incorporate interior sprinklers that\n\nsuccessfully suppress 98 percent of fires.\n\n       Cal Coast engaged a consultant to prepare an analysis of potential noise impacts\n\ncaused by the project. The consultant reported that school would be in session from 8:30\n\na.m. until 2:00 p.m., with morning and lunch breaks. No physical education classes\n\nwould be on site, and the school would not use bells or other alarms (except for fire\n\nalarms). Given the proximity of State Route 56, approximately 200 feet from the project\n\nsite, the consultant found the average ambient noise level at the site was approximately\n\n60 decibels. The consultant identified the loudest likely noise generated by students and\n\nfaculty at the school as laughter, which has a level of approximately 88 decibels. It\n\nmodeled a worst-case scenario, where the laughter was continuous over a one-hour\n\nperiod, and the weighted average noise levels ranged between 38 and 49 decibels at the\n\nreceivers in the model. Because these levels were less than the observed noise level at\n\nthe site, the consultant concluded the project's noise impact would not exceed levels that\n\nwould disturb sensitive wildlife under the City's noise significance determination\n\nthresholds.\n\n                          The Final MND and Public Comments\n\n       After receiving the comments and reports described above, City staff prepared a\n\nfinal MND for the project. The final MND incorporated Cal Coast's requested change to\n\n                                             10\n\fthe project description, as well as new information from the reports and analyses prepared\n\nby Cal Coast. For example, City staff changed their conclusion regarding emergency\n\naccess to the project from \"no impact\" to \"less than significant impact\" and added detail\n\nregarding the City's review of emergency access to the school. After review by the San\n\nDiego Fire Department, City staff determined the school met its emergency access\n\nrequirements. This determination was supported by Cal Coast's fire consultant, who\n\nconcluded that the project would not expose people or structures to a significant risk of\n\nloss, injury, or death from wildland fires. The final MND confirmed, however, that \"the\n\nphysical scope of the project, project impacts, proposed mitigation measures and\n\nconclusions of the [MND] are not affected by the revisions.\"\n\n       After City staff prepared the final MND, the Carmel Valley Community Planning\n\nBoard (CVCPB) considered the project. Christian Clews is a member of the CVCPB, but\n\nhe recused himself from its consideration of the project. Several board members\n\nexpressed concern about the multifamily residential zoning of the project site and\n\nexpressed their desire to have open space there. The project was put to a vote by the\n\nboard. The vote failed, with five in favor, four opposed, and two abstentions. Nine votes\n\nwere required to support the project.\n\n       The board chair subsequently wrote to the City to describe the \"unusual dilemma\"\n\nthe project posed to the board. He wrote that the site's multifamily residential zoning\n\nseemed incompatible with the community plan, which designated the site as open space.\n\n(For this reason, the chair abstained from the vote.) The chair stated that he personally\n\ndid not object to a school at the site because it appeared to be an acceptable use of the\n\n                                             11\n\fprotected area. But other board members expressed concern that the school's use of the\n\nsite would not be compatible with the horse ranch next door. The chair believed further\n\nstudy of the issue was needed. Other board objections included concerns over the impact\n\nof noise and traffic on the horse ranch, the impact of the school's operation on the public\n\nparking lot that would be used by the school's shuttle buses, the impact of development\n\non the rural setting and nearby recreational trails, the severity of fire hazards and the\n\nadequacy of evacuation routes, and the general sense that \"many issues still could use\n\nmore detailed and guaranteed solutions.\"\n\n       CLL submitted additional comments objecting to allegedly significant changes to\n\nthe project and demanding recirculation of the MND. CLL also argued that the City had\n\nnot complied with its historical resource regulations. Collingsworth submitted additional\n\ncomments as well that criticized the project's brush management and evacuation plans.\n\nHe also rebutted the City's responses to comments on the draft MND.\n\n                          Proceedings Before the Hearing Officer\n\n       The City scheduled a public hearing on the project before a City hearing officer.\n\nIn a report to the hearing officer, City staff recommended the project be approved in full,\n\ni.e., the final MND be adopted and permits for coastal development and site development\n\nbe issued. The report described the current site conditions, the proposed project, and the\n\ngoverning community plan. It noted the site was within an area of designated open\n\nspace, but it concluded that the project was consistent with the community plan's open\n\nspace policies because the new development did not extend beyond previously developed\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\fand disturbed areas. After hearing speakers for and against approval, the hearing officer\n\napproved the project and adopted the MND.\n\n       The public hearing notice stated, \"The decision of the Hearing Officer is final\n\nunless appealed to the Planning Commission,\" and \"The decision made by the Planning\n\nCommission is the final decision by the City.\" It then advised, \"The adoption of [an\n\nMND] may be appealed to the City Council after all other appeal rights have been\n\nexhausted. All such appeals must be filed by 5:00 PM within ten (10) business days from\n\nthe date of the Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the environmental\n\ndocument.\"\n\n       At the time of the hearing, the City published Information Bulletin 505, a guide to\n\nthe City's appeal procedure under the SDMC. The City divides its procedures for\n\napproving development applications into different numbered processes. (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0501.) The City handled the project at issue here under Process Three. The\n\nbulletin stated, \"Process Two and Three permit decisions are appealable to the Planning\n\nCommission. Process Four permit decisions are appealable to the City Council. Appeals\n\nof Environmental Determinations may be made after all project appeal rights have been\n\nexhausted.\" It further stated, \"All appeals must be made in accordance with the\n\nprocedures listed in Chapter 11, Article 2, Division 5. All appeals must be made no later\n\nthan close of business, within ten (10) business days of the original decision date (Process\n\nThree and Four) . . . .\" The bulletin specified the filing location for \"Process Two and\n\nThree Decisions Appealable to the Planning Commission\" as the City's Development\n\nServices Department, and the filing location for \"Process Four Decisions and\n\n                                            13\n\fEnvironmental Determinations Appealable to the City Council\" as the City Clerk's\n\nOffice. 2\n\n                           Appeal to the Planning Commission\n\n       CLL appealed the hearing officer's decision to the Planning Commission on a City\n\nform, DS-3031. CLL selected \"Process Three Decision - Appeal to the Planning\n\nCommission\" as the \"Type of Appeal.\" It filed the form with the City's Development\n\nServices Department. It did not select \"Environmental Determination - Appeal to City\n\nCouncil\" or file the form with the City Clerk's Office.\n\n       CLL identified numerous grounds for appeal. It contended the hearing officer's\n\nfindings under CEQA and in the final MND were not supported, including in the areas of\n\ntraffic and transportation, noise, hazards, and cultural resources. It also contended the\n\nproject's approval conflicted with the City's historical resource regulations and the\n\nCarmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan.\n\n       In a report to the Planning Commission, City staff recommended that CLL's\n\nappeal be denied. After recounting the conditions at the site and the description of the\n\nproject, the report addressed the issues identified by CLL's appeal. The report noted that\n\nan MND had been adopted by the hearing officer, but no appeal had been filed\n\nchallenging that environmental determination. The report stated that the time to appeal\n\nhad expired 10 business days after the hearing officer's decision, so any issues based on\n\n\n\n2      As we will discuss in detail below, the parties dispute the accuracy of the\ndescriptions of the City's appeal procedure in Information Bulletin 505 and the public\nhearing notice.\n                                             14\n\fCEQA or the MND had been waived. The report rejected CLL's contention that the City\n\nfailed to comply with its historical resources regulations. The project would maintain the\n\nexisting historic farmhouse, and the new construction was consistent with the\n\nfarmhouse's aesthetics. Based on these facts, the project was consistent with federal\n\nstandards for historical resource preservation and did not require a site development\n\npermit under the City's historical resource regulations. (A site development permit was\n\nrequired, however, based on its location in the Carmel Valley community plan area.) The\n\nreport further rejected CLL's contention that the project conflicted with the community\n\nplan's open space designation for reasons previously discussed.\n\n       CLL objected to the report's characterization of its appeal. In correspondence with\n\nCity staff, CLL argued it had appealed the hearing officer's environmental determination,\n\nas evidenced by its statement of the grounds of appeal. CLL claimed it was not required\n\nto appeal the environmental determination to the City Council until its other appeals had\n\nbeen exhausted, i.e., after the Planning Commission rendered its decision. City staff\n\nresponded that CLL was welcome to present its argument to the Planning Commission.\n\n       At the Planning Commission's first hearing on the project, a commissioner asked\n\nthe deputy city attorney present about the scope of CLL's appeal. The attorney responded\n\nthat CLL had not properly appealed the hearing officer's environmental determination\n\nbecause it had not indicated on its appeal form that it was pursuing an appeal of that\n\ndetermination. She explained, \"Had [the appropriate box] been checked, this appeal\n\nwould be set before the City Council and would not be heard before this body.\" Later in\n\nthe hearing, a commissioner expressed sympathy with CLL's position, finding it clear that\n\n                                            15\n\fCLL attempted to appeal both the permit approvals and the environmental determination.\n\nShe requested that the appeal be returned to City staff and calendared before the City\n\nCouncil. The deputy city attorney responded that the appeal procedures are laid out in\n\nthe SDMC, and it would be impossible to transfer the appeal to the City Council. The\n\ncommissioner further requested that the City's appeal form and information bulletin be\n\nrevised to reflect the correct procedures. The attorney said they would follow-up on the\n\ncommissioner's request. After hearing numerous speakers for and against the project,\n\nincluding both fire experts, the Planning Commission trailed consideration of the project\n\nto its next meeting.\n\n       At the next meeting, the commissioners questioned Cal Coast, CLL, and their\n\nrepresentatives. However, the Planning Commission was unable to reach the four-vote\n\nthreshold to act on the project. The vote on a motion to approve the project and deny\n\nCLL's appeal was three in favor and two opposed, with two not voting. Consideration of\n\nthe project was trailed again to a future meeting.\n\n       When the Planning Commission considered the project a third time, a motion to\n\napprove the project and deny CLL's appeal prevailed on a vote of four in favor, two\n\nopposed, and one not voting. The Planning Commission's decision was memorialized in\n\na resolution granting a coastal development permit and site development permit for the\n\nproject. The resolution and permits included extensive findings regarding the project and\n\nits compliance with the City's land use policies.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f                           Attempted Appeal to the City Council\n\n       CLL attempted to file an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to the City\n\nCouncil. CLL used a redesigned form DS-3031 that identified the \"Type of Appeal\" as\n\neither \"Appeal of the Project\" or \"Appeal of the Environmental Determination.\" The\n\nvarious City processes, and the body to which the appeal was made, were no longer\n\nidentified on the form. CLL indicated it was appealing both the project and the\n\nenvironmental determination. As grounds for its appeal, CLL identified various\n\nenvironmental impacts it believed required preparation of an EIR, including\n\ntransportation and traffic, fire hazards, land use and planning, noise, and historical\n\nresources. CLL also contended, among other things, that the MND should have been\n\nrecirculated because the final MND contained significant revisions to the project and\n\nadditional mitigation measures. To justify its appeal, CLL referenced language in the\n\npublic hearing notice and information bulletin that purported to authorize an appeal of an\n\nenvironmental determination after all other appeal rights had been exhausted.\n\n       The City rejected CLL's appeal. In its rejection letter, the City stated that CLL's\n\nappeal challenging the environmental determination was untimely under the SDMC. The\n\nPlanning Commission's approval of permitting for the project was final and not\n\nappealable.\n\n                       Appeal to the California Coastal Commission\n\n       CLL then appealed to the California Coastal Commission. CLL argued, among\n\nother things, that the project was inconsistent with the City's Local Coastal Program\n\n(LCP). To support its argument, CLL pointed to the community plan's designation of the\n\n                                             17\n\farea as open space and the historic status of the farmhouse at the site. CLL claimed the\n\nCity failed to analyze the effect of the project on the functions of the open space,\n\nincluding the benefits of the CVREP recreation areas, and failed to follow its historical\n\nresource regulations. CLL also claimed the project would expose its horse ranch and\n\nusers of nearby trails to increased fire hazards because of inadequate evacuation routes.\n\n       Coastal Commission staff assessed CLL's appeal and found it raised no substantial\n\nissue. The staff's report concluded the project was consistent with the LCP. The report\n\nrejected CLL's open space argument because the site had already been developed and\n\ndisturbed, and it found the City had complied with its historical resource regulations. It\n\nfurther noted, \"Fire safety and evacuation is not a[n] LCP issue; however, the\n\ndevelopment complies with all fire-related requirements including brush management\n\nand building design.\" The report referenced a number of project elements that would\n\naddress fire hazards and fire safety.\n\n       The Coastal Commission's staff report concluded, \"[T]here is strong and legal\n\nsupport for the City's determination that the proposed development is consistent with the\n\ncertified LCP. . . . The extent and scope of the development is minor.\" At a public\n\nhearing, the Commission agreed with the report and found no substantial issue.\n\n                                Superior Court Proceedings\n\n       CLL then filed the instant petition for writ of mandate and complaint for\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, violation of procedural due process and equitable\n\nestoppel. The operative first amended petition and complaint alleged that the MND was\n\nimproperly adopted because the project would have significant environmental impacts in\n\n                                             18\n\fthe areas already discussed above and because the final MND had significant new\n\nmaterial that required recirculation. The petition and complaint repeated CLL's\n\ncontentions that the community plan's open space designation prohibited the project and\n\nthat the City failed to follow its historical resource regulations. The petition and\n\ncomplaint also challenged the City's appeal procedures. It alleged that the procedures did\n\nnot comply with CEQA because they segregated environmental determinations from\n\nproject approvals. It further alleged that the City did not provide adequate notice of the\n\nappellate procedures, thereby violating state law, the SDMC, and CLL's constitutional\n\nright to procedural due process. Finally, the petition and complaint alleged that the City\n\nshould be equitably estopped from claiming that CLL had not adequately appealed\n\nadoption of the MND because the public hearing notice and other documents inaccurately\n\ndescribed the appeal procedures.\n\n       After briefing and argument, the trial court denied the petition and rejected CLL's\n\nclaims. The court concluded CLL failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in City\n\nproceedings by failing to properly appeal the hearing officer's environmental\n\ndetermination. It found the City was not estopped from asserting a defense based on\n\nadministrative exhaustion and that the City's appeal procedure did not violate CEQA.\n\nEven if the defense did not apply, the court was unpersuaded that adoption of the MND\n\nwas unjustified. The court explained, \"The court agrees with the City and [Cal Coast]\n\nthat much of what motivated petitioners' objection to the building of the school next door\n\nhas nothing to do with environmental concerns. Petitioners just do not want the academy\n\nas a neighbor because they feel it will affect them adversely from an economic\n\n                                             19\n\fperspective.\" The court did not believe there was a fair argument that the project would\n\nsignificantly impact the environment. It stated, \"The dominant neighbor of the proposed\n\nacademy is [State Route] 56, hardly an environmentally sensitive area.

(§ 21177,\nsubds. (a) & (b).) Cal Coast and the City proffer defenses based on these requirements as\nwell, but we need not consider them because we reject CLL's contentions on the merits in\nthe following sections. Although courts have described section 21177 as \"codif[ying] the\ndoctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies for CEQA\" (Citizens for Open\nGovernment, supra, 144 Cal.App.4th at p. 875), it does not cover every circumstance\nwhere the doctrine applies. (See Tahoe Vista, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 590\n[\"Notwithstanding the Legislature's expressed intent, section 21177 is not properly\nspeaking an exhaustion of administrative remedies statute.\"].) Section 21177 does not\napply here, for example, where the plaintiff raises a ground for noncompliance before a\npublic agency's decision but does not pursue available administrative procedures to\nchallenge that decision.\n                                            23\n\f       As noted, the City has established five \"decision processes\" to handle applications\n\nfor permits, maps, and other planning decisions. (SDMC, § 112.0501.) The City applied\n\nits \"Process Three\" to Cal Coast's application. Under Process Three, an application may\n\nbe approved, conditionally approved, or denied by a hearing officer at a public hearing.\n\n(Id., § 112.0505.) The hearing officer must comply with CEQA's environmental review\n\nand certify or adopt the appropriate environmental document (e.g., negative declaration,\n\nMND, or EIR). (Id., § 128.0311, subd. (a).) The hearing officer's decision may be\n\nappealed to the Planning Commission within 10 business days by filing an application\n\nwith the City Manager. (Id., § 112.0506.) The Planning Commission may affirm,\n\nreverse, or modify the decision being appealed. (Id., § 112.0506, subd. (f).)\n\n       The SDMC contains a separate section describing the procedure for environmental\n\ndetermination appeals. (SDMC, § 112.0520.) The SDMC defines an \"environmental\n\ndetermination\" as \"a decision by any non-elected City decisionmaker, to certify an\n\nenvironmental impact report, adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative\n\ndeclaration, or to determine that a project is exempt from [CEQA] . . . .\" (Id.,\n\n§ 113.0103.) The procedure for environmental determination appeals applies regardless\n\nof the decision process adopted by the City: \"Notwithstanding other provisions of this\n\nCode, any person may appeal an environmental determination not made by the City\n\nCouncil.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (a), italics omitted.) An environmental determination\n\nappeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 10 business days of either \"the date of\n\nposting of the Notice of Right to Appeal Environmental Determination\" or \"the date of a\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\fdecision by a Hearing Officer or the Planning Commission to adopt or certify an\n\nenvironmental document.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (b).)\n\n       The City Council may grant or deny the appeal. (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e).) If the\n\nCity Council denies the appeal, it will \"approve the environmental determination and\n\nadopt the CEQA findings and statement of overriding considerations of the previous\n\ndecision-maker, where appropriate.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e)(2), italics omitted.) If\n\nthe City Council grants the appeal, it will set aside the environmental determination and\n\nreturn it to City staff for reconsideration. (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (e)(2), (f)(2).) \"The\n\nPlanning Director shall reconsider the environmental determination . . . and prepare a\n\nrevised environmental document as appropriate, in consideration of any direction from\n\nthe City Council.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (f)(2), italics omitted.) During this time, \"[t]he\n\nlower decision-maker's decision to approve the project shall be held in abeyance. The\n\nCity Council shall retain jurisdiction to act on the revised environmental document and\n\nassociated project at a subsequent public hearing.\" (Id., § 112.0520, subd. (f)(1).)\n\n       At the subsequent hearing, the City Council has the power to consider the revised\n\nenvironmental document and the associated project. \"At a subsequent hearing, the City\n\nCouncil shall again consider the environmental determination and associated projects,\n\nand may take action as follows: [¶] (A) Certify or adopt the environmental document;\n\nadopt CEQA findings and statement of overriding considerations as appropriate; and\n\naffirm the previous decision to approve the associated project; [¶] (B) Certify or adopt\n\nthe environmental document; adopt CEQA findings and statement of overriding\n\nconsiderations as appropriate; condition and approve the associated project as modified;\n\n                                              25\n\for [¶] (C) Find that the environmental document is insufficient, in which case the\n\ndocument shall not be certified. The associated project shall be denied and the decision\n\nshall be deemed the final administrative action.\" (SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (f)(3), italics\n\nomitted.)\n\n       Taken together, these provisions establish a bifurcated appeals procedure for\n\nProcess Three decisions made by a hearing officer. While a hearing officer's \"decision\"\n\nmay be appealed to the Planning Commission within 10 business days (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0506, subd. (b)), any environmental determination by the hearing officer must\n\nsimultaneously be appealed to the City Council within the same period (id., § 112.0520,\n\nsubd. (b)(2)). As a result of this bifurcation, an appeal to the Planning Commission\n\ncovers only the nonenvironmental project approvals (e.g., permits), while an appeal to the\n\nCity Council covers the environmental determination. If the City Council grants the\n\nappeal, however, it may consider the non-environmental project approvals as well.\n\n       The sequencing and interaction of these two appeals is unclear, but we need not\n\ndelve further into City procedure in order to resolve the dispute before us. CLL filed\n\nonly an appeal of the hearing officer's decision to the Planning Commission. It did not\n\nfile an appeal of the hearing officer's environmental determination. It therefore did not\n\navail itself of the City's administrative appeals procedure that was available to address\n\nCLL's objections to the hearing officer's adoption of the MND. CLL did not exhaust its\n\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fadministrative remedies regarding the MND, and it may not now bring a judicial action\n\nchallenging it. (See Tahoe Vista, supra, 81 Cal.App.4th at p. 592.) 4\n\n       CLL argues its failure to appeal the hearing officer's environmental determination\n\nis excused because the City's bifurcated appeal procedures are invalid under CEQA. (See\n\nCalifornia Clean Energy Committee v. City of San Jose (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1346 (California Clean Energy).) CEQA requires the person or persons responsible for\n\napproving a project (the \"decisionmaking body\" in CEQA parlance) also be responsible\n\nfor complying with CEQA's environmental review (e.g., by certifying an EIR, adopting a\n\nnegative declaration or MND, or determining that the project is exempt). (See\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15025, subd. (b), 15356.) Assuming authority is properly delegated\n\nwithin the public agency, the decisionmaking body may be an unelected official or\n\ncommission. (California Clean Energy, at p. 1336 & fn. 3.) If the decisionmaking body\n\nis unelected, however, the decisionmaking body's compliance with CEQA must be\n\nappealable to the agency's elected decisionmaking body, if any. (§ 21151, subd. (c);\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15061, subd. (e), 15074, subd. (f), 15090, subd. (b).)\n\n\n\n\n4      CLL claims that its appeal from the Planning Commission's decision was\nsufficient to appeal the environmental determination to the City Council. CLL relies on\nthe SDMC provision governing the timing of environmental determination appeals,\nwhich must be filed \"[w]ithin 10 business days from the date of a decision by a Hearing\nOfficer or the Planning Commission to adopt or certify an environmental document.\"\n(SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (b), italics added.) But, under the City's Process Three, it was\nthe hearing officer who adopted the environmental document, not the Planning\nCommission. CLL therefore had 10 business days from the hearing officer's decision to\nappeal the environmental determination. The later Planning Commission decision on\nnonenvironmental matters did not reset the time to appeal.\n                                            27\n\f       The City's procedure, at least as relevant here, complies with these requirements.\n\nUnder Process Three, the hearing officer has the authority to approve the project and\n\ncomply with CEQA's environmental review. (SDMC, §§ 112.0505, 128.0311, subd. (a).)\n\nThe hearing officer is therefore the City's decisionmaking body under the Guidelines.\n\nAnd, because the hearing officer is unelected, the City's procedures allow an appeal of the\n\nhearing officer's environmental determination to the City's elected City Council. (SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0520.) CLL simply did not avail itself of that procedure.\n\n       CLL relies on California Clean Energy, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, but it is\n\ninapposite. In that case, the local agency had delegated the authority to comply with\n\nCEQA's environmental review to its planning commission. (Id. at p. 1337.) This\n\ndelegation was improper because the planning commission did not have the authority to\n\napprove the project at issue. (Id. at pp. 1338, 1340.) The planning commission's\n\npurported certification of a final EIR for the project was therefore unauthorized by\n\nCEQA, and the plaintiff's challenge to that certification was not barred by its failure to\n\nappeal the planning commission's environmental decision. (Id. at p. 1346.) Here, the\n\nhearing officer's adoption of an MND for the project was procedurally proper, since the\n\nhearing officer also had the authority to approve the project. California Clean Energy\n\ndoes not apply.\n\n       The other authorities CLL cites confirm that the hearing officer's adoption of the\n\nMND was procedurally proper because he was the City's decisionmaking body for the\n\nproject.

The City's procedure establishing an appeal to the City Council to challenge\n\nthe hearing officer's adoption of the MND was likewise proper. (See Vedanta Society of\n\nSo. California v. California Quartet, Ltd. (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527-528.) CLL\n\nwas required to pursue this appeal in order to exhaust its administrative remedies.\n\n       CLL argues that the City's appeal procedures are inadequate because the Planning\n\nCommission has authority over project approvals but not the environmental\n\ndetermination. But this alleged inadequacy does not affect the validity of the hearing\n\nofficer's environmental determination, so it provides no excuse for CLL's failure to\n\nappeal that determination. (Cf. California Clean Energy, supra, 220 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1346.) In addition, it is unclear on the current record which procedure would have\n\napplied had CLL properly appealed the environmental determination. During the first\n\nPlanning Commission meeting below, a deputy city attorney told the commissioners,\n\n                                            29\n\f\"Had [the appropriate box] been checked, this appeal would be set before the City\n\nCouncil and would not be heard before this body.\"\n\n       CLL also argues the City Council is not a \"decisionmaking body\" because project\n\napproval under Process Three progresses from the hearing officer to the Planning\n\nCommission. (SDMC, § 112.0506.) No independent appeal to the City Council, separate\n\nfrom an environmental determination, is authorized. (Ibid.) The Planning Commission's\n\ndecision is final. In CLL's view, the City Council is therefore not a \"person or group of\n\npeople within a public agency permitted by law to approve or disapprove the project at\n\nissue.\" (Guidelines, § 15356.) If the City grants the environmental determination appeal,\n\nhowever, it has such authority. (SDMC, § 112.0520, subd. (f).) Neither CEQA nor the\n\nGuidelines require that a local agency's elected decisionmaking body accept appeals\n\nregarding every project approval, separate and apart from environmental review. They\n\nrequire only that the environmental determination be appealable. (§ 21151, subd. (c);\n\nGuidelines, §§ 15061, subd. (e), 15074, subd. (f), 15090, subd. (b).) The City's\n\nprocedures allow exactly that.\n\n       CLL further claims its failure to appeal should be excused based on inaccurate\n\ndescriptions of the City's appeal process in the public hearing notice for Cal Coast's\n\nproject and the City's Information Bulletin 505. The public hearing notice misstated the\n\nprocedure for an environmental determination appeal by implying that the appeal should\n\noccur after the Planning Commission considered the project: \"The adoption of [an MND]\n\nmay be appealed to the City Council after all other appeal rights have been exhausted.\n\nAll such appeals must be filed by 5:00 PM within ten (10) business days from the date of\n\n                                             30\n\fthe Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the environmental document.\"\n\nUnder the SDMC, the appeal to City Council for a Process Three project does not occur\n\n\"after all other appeal rights have been exhausted;\" it occurs simultaneously with the\n\nappeal to the Planning Commission. And, while the notice's reference to an appeal\n\n\"within ten (10) business days of the Planning Commission's certification/adoption of the\n\nenvironmental document\" may be applicable to other projects (see, e.g., SDMC,\n\n§ 112.0507 [describing the City's Process Four]), it is not accurate under the Process\n\nThree procedures the City applied to this project because the time to appeal ran from the\n\nhearing officer's adoption of the environmental document. The City's information\n\nbulletin, which was referenced in the public hearing notice, states that appeals must be\n\nmade in accordance with the SDMC and does not describe the specific procedures, except\n\nto state, \"Appeals of Environmental Determinations may be made after all project appeal\n\nrights have been exhausted.\" Again, this statement incorrectly describes the sequencing\n\nof the project and environmental determination appeals under Process Three, which must\n\nbe pursued simultaneously.\n\n       CLL primarily frames its argument based on these inaccuracies as one of improper\n\nnotice under CEQA. This framing does not fit the facts here. The authorities CLL cites\n\ndiscuss the failure to comply with CEQA's requirement that an \"alleged grounds for\n\nnoncompliance\" with CEQA be presented to a public agency under section 21177,\n\nsubdivision (a). (See Temecula Band of Luiseno Mission Indians v. Rancho Cal. Water\n\nDist. (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433-435 (Temecula Band); McQueen v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1150-1151 (McQueen).) This requirement \"does\n\n                                            31\n\fnot apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there\n\nwas no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those\n\nobjections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the project, or if the public agency\n\nfailed to give the notice required by law.\" (§ 21177, subd. (e).) In McQueen, the court\n\nheld that an inaccurate and misleading project description is \"tantamount to a lack of\n\nnotice\" under CEQA, thus excusing the plaintiff's failure to raise a noncompliance issue\n\nearly in the public agency's consideration of the project. (McQueen, supra, at p. 1150.)\n\nTemecula Band agreed with McQueen's interpretation of the statute, but it distinguished\n\nMcQueen on the facts. (Temecula Band, supra, at p. 434.) While the project description\n\nwas inaccurate and misleading, as in McQueen, the project was clarified at a subsequent\n\npublic hearing. (Ibid.) The plaintiff failed to object after that clarification, despite an\n\nopportunity to do so, and therefore its failure to raise a noncompliance issue was not\n\nexcused. (Ibid.)\n\n       CLL's failure to appeal is not a failure to raise a noncompliance issue under\n\nsection 21177. McQueen and Temecula Band therefore have little relevance to the\n\nadministrative exhaustion issue here. And, even taken on their own terms, these\n\nauthorities stand only for the proposition that a plaintiff should be excused from failing to\n\nraise a noncompliance issue where a misleading project description—or complete lack of\n\nnotice—has misled a plaintiff into believing there is no noncompliance issue at all.\n\n(§ 21177, subd.

CLL\n\ncontends the project may have significant effects in the areas of fire hazards, traffic and\n\ntransportation, noise, recreation, and historical resources.\n\n       For reasons we will explain, CLL has not made a sufficient showing here. The\n\nproject at issue is relatively modest and located on already-developed land. The record\n\ndoes not reflect any fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the\n\n                                              36\n\fenvironment that would not be mitigated. We will address each of the areas CLL\n\nidentifies in turn. 5\n\n                                       Fire Hazards\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment by increasing the risk\n\nof fire hazards, including wildfires. Here, however, CLL has not shown the project\n\nwould have any significant effect on fire hazards in the area. The project meets all\n\napplicable fire codes, the project site is already developed, and CLL's large commercial\n\nhorse ranch already operates on the neighboring parcel. The area already sees vehicular\n\nand pedestrian traffic. CLL has not shown any of the project's activities have a\n\nreasonable possibility of significantly increasing the risk of fire hazards. Indeed, by\n\nincorporating a new water line and fire hydrant, the project appears to increase fire safety\n\nin the area.\n\n       CLL focuses on the location of the project in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity\n\nZone (see Gov. Code, § 51178) and the risk to persons and property from potential\n\nwildfires in the area. CLL's focus is misplaced. As our Supreme Court has explained,\n\n\"we must distinguish between requirements that consider the environment's effects on a\n\nproject and those that contemplate the project's impacts on the existing environment.\"\n\n(CBIA, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 388.) Only the latter impacts are valid under CEQA. It is\n\n\n\n5     CLL's opening brief presents its argument that there was substantial evidence in\nchronological order, identifying in turn bits of evidence in the City's initial study,\ncomments to the draft and final MND, and testimony before the hearing officer and at the\nPlanning Commission. Presenting this information chronologically, rather than by topic,\nmakes our review of CLL's argument more difficult and lessens its persuasive value.\n                                             37\n\fproper to evaluate \"a project's potentially significant exacerbating effects on existing\n\nenvironmental hazards—effects that arise because the project brings 'development and\n\npeople into the area affected.' \" (Ibid.) But considering existing environmental hazards,\n\nunchanged by the project, are not proper under CEQA. \"CEQA generally does not\n\nrequire an analysis of how existing environmental conditions will impact a project's\n\nfuture users or residents.\" (Id. at p. 386.) 6\n\n       CLL argues the project will inhibit the ability of people and, at the ranch, animals\n\nto evacuate in the event of a wildfire. CLL points to the alleged \"inability to timely and\n\nsafely evacuate 95 school personnel and students in conjunction with [CLL's] 135 horses\n\nand 15 cattle, ranch personnel, clients and trailers through the narrow Clews Ranch\n\nRoad.\" But Clews Ranch Road is 20 feet wide and only 1,650 feet long. Complaints\n\nabout its inadequacy are speculative. The project will also have an alternate evacuation\n\nroute westward along a dirt road, and it intends to operate only part of the year and will\n\nclose on red flag warning days. The inherent difficulty in evacuating \"135 horses and 15\n\ncattle, ranch personnel, clients and trailers\" already exists and will not be significantly\n\naffected by the project. Viewing the record as a whole, there is no fair argument that the\n\nproject will materially affect evacuation routes in the area.\n\n       CLL relies on the comments submitted by its fire safety expert, Van\n\nCollingsworth. His comments consist largely of general observations regarding fire\n\n\n6      CEQA provides for exceptions to this general rule in certain specific contexts,\nincluding school construction projects near hazardous waste disposal sites or freeways.\n(§ 21151.8, subd. (a)(3)(B); see CBIA, supra, 62 Cal.4th at p. 391.) Very High Fire\nHazard Severity Zones are not included.\n                                                 38\n\fhazards not tied to the project, questions about the project, and topics allegedly\n\nunaddressed or inadequately addressed in the MND and project materials. His general\n\nobservations cannot, in and of themselves, create a fair argument without some nexus\n\nwith the project itself. His questions about the project and the topics allegedly\n\nunaddressed or inadequately addressed also cannot create a fair argument without some\n\nshowing that those questions and topics refer to a potentially significant effect on the\n\nenvironment that the project may create. Collingsworth also focuses on the effect of the\n\nenvironment on the project (students and faculty at the school), rather than the effect of\n\nthe project on the environment, which is incorrect for the reasons we have already\n\ndiscussed. Collingsworth's remaining comments are conclusory, speculative, or\n\notherwise unsupported. They are likewise insufficient.\n\n       CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the project's effect on the fire\n\nhazards in the environment, including as a consequence of bringing additional people into\n\nthe area, may be significant. The City therefore was not required to prepare an EIR on\n\nthis basis.\n\n                                Traffic and Transportation\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment by increasing traffic or\n\nimpeding transportation. Various comments from the public argued the project here\n\nwould create an unreasonable traffic situation on Clews Ranch Road. They claimed that\n\nthe road could not support the estimated 117 additional daily trips caused by the project\n\nbecause the road was narrow, \"may create conflicts for two-way traffic,\" and was used by\n\npedestrians and horses as well. Barbara Clews and others contended that there were also\n\n                                             39\n\f\"blind corners\" on the road. As to the last comment, it appears contradicted by the actual\n\ncondition of the road, which is only 1,650 feet long and largely straight. On direct issues\n\nof credibility, we must defer to the hearing officer. (See Joshua Tree, supra, 1\n\nCal.App.5th at p. 684.) The remaining comments are insufficient to create a fair\n\nargument that the project may have a significant impact on traffic and transportation.\n\nClews Ranch Road was 20 feet wide and allowed two-way traffic. It had supported\n\ntraffic to and from CLL's large commercial horse ranch and the project site, including\n\nduring special events, without incident.\n\n       The factual situation here is far different from the situation in Keep Our\n\nMountains Quiet v. County of Santa Clara (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">714</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which CLL cites.\n\nIn that case, an initial report by the California Department of Transportation found there\n\nwould be \" 'significant impacts to the operations and traffic movements to the site\n\nentrances' and 'might impede [Summit Road] in both directions because of numerous\n\nvehicles making right and left-turns into the site.' \" (Id. at p. 725.) The road leading to\n\nthe project site was winding and very narrow (under 10 feet at one point), with 39 blind\n\ncurves. (Id. at p. 727.) The accident rate was twice the statewide average. (Id. at pp.\n\n726-727.) No such facts were developed here.\n\n       The commenters' predictions of significant impacts alone are insufficient absent\n\nspecific facts in the record supporting a fair argument. \" '[I]n the absence of a specific\n\nfactual foundation in the record, dire predictions by nonexperts regarding the\n\nconsequences of a project do not constitute substantial evidence.' \" (Joshua Tree, supra,\n\n1 Cal.App.5th at p. 690.) CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the\n\n                                             40\n\fproject's effect on traffic and transportation may be significant. The City was not\n\nrequired to prepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                            Noise\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment through the noise it\n\ngenerates. (See Oro Fino Gold Mining Corp. v. County of El Dorado (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 882 [noise generated by gold mine's drilling rig].) Several commenters\n\nassociated with CLL's horse ranch predicted significant noise impacts because noises\n\nfrom school activities could disrupt ranch operations. For example, one commenter\n\ndescribed incidents in which construction noise at the project site had frightened horses\n\nand caused them to throw their riders. But the possibility that noise will impact the horse\n\nranch's operations is insufficient. \"Under CEQA, the question is whether a project will\n\naffect the environment of persons in general, not whether a project will affect particular\n\npersons.\" (Mira Mar Mobile Community v. City of Oceanside (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">477</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492.) The noise likely generated by the school (children laughing and playing, cars\n\ndriving, doors closing, etc.) is insignificant in the context of the environment as a whole,\n\nespecially given the project's location near a busy highway, State Route 56, and CLL's\n\nlarge ranch.\n\n       Even if the noise generated by the school adversely impacted the ability of the\n\nranch to continue operation as a viable business, the impact on the ranch alone would be\n\ninsufficient to support preparation of an EIR. The fact that a project may affect another\n\nbusiness's economic viability is not an effect covered by CEQA unless it results in a\n\nchange in the physical environment (e.g., urban decay). (Joshua Tree, supra, 1\n\n                                             41\n\fCal.App.5th at p. 685.) CLL has not shown that there is a fair argument that the project's\n\neffect on noise in the environment may be significant. The City was not required to\n\nprepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                         Recreation\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment if it reduces available\n\nrecreation activities. The project here will use a public parking lot serving nearby trails\n\nas a pick-up and drop-off point for its shuttles. Commenters believed the school's use of\n\nthe parking lot would leave little room for other users. For example, the CVCPB\n\nexpressed concern that \"[u]nresolved operational issues such as the drop-off and pickup\n\nlocation may impact traffic flow on Carmel Country Road and [the location] may be\n\ninadequate for the added use beyond much needed parking for the heavily used CVREP\n\npublic trails.\" Speculation by commenters such as the CVCPB is not substantial\n\nevidence, and it is insufficient to support a fair argument that the project may have a\n\nsignificant impact on recreation. (Joshua Tree, supra, 1 Cal.App.5th at p. 690.) CLL has\n\nnot shown the City was required to prepare an EIR on this basis.\n\n                                   Historical Resources\n\n       A project may have a significant effect on the environment if it affects historical\n\nresources. The project here would not alter the historic farmhouse on the site or its\n\noutbuildings, and the architecture of the new school on the property is consistent with the\n\nfarmhouse's aesthetic. CLL claims the City should have undertaken additional study of\n\nthe project's impact on the broader Mount Carmel Ranch historical resource, but such\n\ncriticism is mere rhetoric without facts supporting such an impact. CLL has not shown\n\n                                             42\n\fthat there is a fair argument that the project's effect on historical resources may be\n\nsignificant. The City was not required to prepare an EIR on this basis. We will address\n\nthe City's compliance with its historical resource regulations in part IV, post.\n\n                                              IV\n\n                                 Recirculation of the MND\n\n       To achieve the public notice purposes of CEQA, an MND must be recirculated if\n\nit is substantially revised after its release but prior to adoption. (Guidelines, § 15073.5,\n\nsubd. (a).) A substantial revision includes the circumstances where \"[a] new, avoidable\n\nsignificant effect is identified and mitigation measures or project revisions must be added\n\nin order to reduce the effect to insignificance,\" or \"[t]he lead agency determines that the\n\nproposed mitigation measures or project revisions will not reduce potential effects to less\n\nthan significance and new measures or revisions must be required.\" (Guidelines,\n\n§ 15073.5, subd. (b)(1)-(2).) Recirculation is not required where \"[n]ew project revisions\n\nare added in response to written or verbal comments on the project's effects identified in\n\nthe proposed negative declaration which are not new avoidable significant effects\";\n\n\"[m]easures or conditions of project approval are added after circulation of the negative\n\ndeclaration which are not required by CEQA, which do not create new significant\n\nenvironmental effects and are not necessary to mitigate an avoidable significant effect\";\n\nor \"[n]ew information is added to the negative declaration which merely clarifies,\n\namplifies, or makes insignificant modifications to the negative declaration.\" (Guidelines,\n\n§ 15073.5, subd. (c)(2)-(4).)\n\n\n\n                                              43\n\f       CLL contends the school's shuttle bus plan and its intent to close on red flag\n\nwarning days, which were added to the project after the MND was circulated, constitute\n\nnew mitigation measures that required recirculation. We disagree. These plans were\n\npurely voluntary, so they cannot constitute mitigation measures. (Guidelines, § 15126.4,\n\nsubd. (a)(2).) And CLL has not shown they were added to the project to reduce\n\nsignificant effects on the environment for the reasons discussed above. Moreover,\n\nadditional information about the project's design and layout, its evacuation plan, and its\n\nbrush management plan, which were also added after circulation, were clarifying and\n\namplifying in nature and did not make substantial revisions to the project. (See\n\nGuidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (c)(4).) Recirculation was not required.\n\n                                              V\n\n                              Historical Resource Regulations\n\n       CLL contends the City failed to follow its historical resource regulations (SDMC,\n\n§ 143.0201 et seq.) and the Historical Resources Guidelines of the City's Land\n\nDevelopment Manual (HRG). To succeed, CLL must establish a prejudicial abuse of\n\ndiscretion, i.e., it must show that the City's actions were \"arbitrary, capricious, in excess\n\nof its jurisdiction, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or without reasonable or\n\nrational basis as a matter of law.\" (Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(SDMC,\n\n§ 143.0210, subd. (a)(1).) The City must proceed under Process Four for certain types of\n\ndevelopment when a designated historical resource is present. (Id., § 126.0502, subd.\n\n(d)(1).) The types of development that require Process Four are subdivisions, single or\n\nmultiple unit residential developments, commercial or industrial developments, public\n\nworks projects, and any developments that deviate from the historical resources\n\nregulations. (Ibid.) The historical resources regulations similarly require Process Four\n\nfor subdivisions, single or multiple unit residential developments, commercial or\n\nindustrial developments, public works projects (other than capital improvement program\n\nprojects), land use plans, and any developments that deviate from the historical resources\n\nregulations (other than capital improvement program projects). (Id., § 143.0210, subd.\n\n(e)(2).)\n\n       Even if these requirements apply, the historical resource regulations contain\n\ncertain exemptions. (SDMC, § 143.0220; see id., §§ 126.0502, subd. (d)(1), 143.0210,\n\nsubd. (e).) One of these exemptions covers \"[a]ny development that proposes minor\n\n                                               45\n\falterations or improvements consistent with [SDMC] Section 143.0250, subdivision (a),\n\nto a designated historical resource, or any historical building or historical structure\n\nlocated within a historical district, or any new construction within a historical district that\n\nwill enhance, restore, maintain, repair, or allow adaptive reuse of the resource and which\n\nwill not adversely affect the special character or special historical, architectural,\n\narchaeological, or cultural value of the resource when all feasible measures to protect and\n\npreserve the historical resource are included in the development proposal consistent with\n\nthe Secretary of Interior's Standards and Guidelines.\" (Id., § 143.0220, subd. (a), italics\n\nomitted.)\n\n         In the report to the Planning Commission for the project, City staff explained that\n\nthe project falls within this exemption because it is new construction that is consistent\n\nwith the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines, the HRG, and the historical\n\nresource regulations. In arguing that Process Four applies, CLL does not address the\n\nsubstance of this exemption. It merely criticizes the City's reliance on the exemption as a\n\npost hoc rationalization. Such criticism is insufficient without a showing that Process\n\nFour should have been applied. \"The decisions of the agency are given substantial\n\ndeference and are presumed correct. The parties seeking mandamus bear the burden of\n\nproving otherwise, and the reviewing court must resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the\n\nadministrative findings and determination.\" (Sierra Club, supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p.\n\n1497.)\n\n         CLL also criticizes the City for not complying with the requirements of the\n\nhistorical resource regulations and the HRG, particularly the absence of any detailed\n\n                                              46\n\fanalysis of the project's effect on the Mount Carmel Ranch, the broader historical\n\nresource of which the project site's historic farmhouse is a part, or of the project's Area of\n\nPotential Effect. Again, CLL's criticism is insufficient. Inadequate explanation\n\nregarding compliance is not the same as noncompliance. (See Sierra Club, supra, 121\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 1497.)\n\n       CLL's further contention that a recommendation of the Historical Resources Board\n\nwas required is incorrect; such a recommendation is only required under Process Four.\n\n(SDMC, § 126.0504, subd. (b)(2).) And its contention that approval of Cal Coast's\n\nproject should have been handled under the same procedures as the prior approval of its\n\ncommercial horse ranch is unpersuasive. The mere fact that CLL complied with different\n\nprocedures does not show that Cal Coast should be held to those procedures. CLL has\n\nnot shown the City erred.\n\n                                             VI\n\n            Consistency with the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan\n\n       CLL argues that the project conflicts with the Carmel Valley Neighborhood 8\n\nPrecise Plan (Precise Plan) adopted by the City. The Precise Plan \"provides development\n\nguidelines for the Neighborhood 8 portion of Carmel Valley, a designated community\n\nplan area within the City[.]\" \"The Neighborhood 8 Precise Plan also functions as a\n\ncomponent in the development implementation process . . . . The precise plan constitutes\n\none of a series of steps in the City approval of development projects in Neighborhood 8.\n\nThe Carmel Valley Community Plan provides guidelines, proposals and concepts for the\n\nfuture development of the entire Carmel Valley community. The precise plan is used by\n\n                                              47\n\fthe individual neighborhoods, within the larger Carmel Valley Plan context, to determine\n\nhow the specific development unit will take shape. It is the precise plan's role to address\n\nissues such as development density, road alignments and community facility sites. The\n\nadopted precise plans then become the basis for reviewing subsequent development\n\nplans, subdivisions, and other permits within their respective development units.\" While\n\nsubordinate to the City's General Plan and the Carmel Valley Community Plan, the\n\nPrecise Plan guides development in the same way for projects within its area of concern.\n\n       The most recent Precise Plan, issued in 2012, designates the project site as open\n\nspace. In their report to the hearing officer, City staff identified the site as designated\n\nnatural open space. The report explained, however, that development on the site was\n\nconsistent with the Precise Plan because the area had already been disturbed: \"The\n\nproject site has been previously disturbed by the prior construction of several concrete\n\npads void of any structures, several accessory buildings, a swimming pool and the\n\nhistoric residential structure. These improvements are or were dispersed throughout the\n\nproperty. The proposed school building is located in an area on the site which was\n\npreviously developed with a swimming pool which has since been capped and covered\n\nwith a concrete pad. New drive aisles and parking areas would be located in areas of\n\nprevious disturbance and are either covered in concrete/asphalt/gravel or are existing\n\nunpaved driveways and/or parking areas. The project design limits new development to\n\npreviously developed and disturbed areas in conformance with the Precise Plan's Open\n\nSpace policies.\" In the report to the Planning Commission following CLL's appeal, City\n\n\n\n                                              48\n\fstaff reiterated their analysis and found no inconsistency between the project and the\n\nPrecise Plan.\n\n       The site development permit issued by the Planning Commission confirms that the\n\nproject site \"is designated Open Space by the Precise Plan.\" But it explained, \"The\n\nproposed Project will be developed on previously disturbed land and will not impact or\n\ndevelop on existing undisturbed open space and [the Multi-Habitat Planning Area] land.\"\n\nIt therefore found that the project would not \"adversely affect the applicable land use\n\nplan.\" 7\n\n       Any local land use or development decision, including approval of the project at\n\nissue here, must be consistent with the applicable general plan and its constituent\n\nelements. (Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th\n\n141, 153 (Orange Citizens).) We review the City's finding that the project is consistent\n\nwith the Precise Plan for abuse of discretion. (Id. at p. 154.) \"A city's determination that\n\na development approval is consistent with its general plan has been described by some\n\ncourts as 'adjudicatory' [citation] and by others as 'quasi-legislative' [citation]. Where a\n\nconsistency determination involves the application of a general plan's established land\n\nuse designation to a particular development, it is fundamentally adjudicatory. In such\n\n\n\n7       Curiously, the City and Cal Coast in their joint respondents' brief take the position\nthat the project site is not designated open space. They rely on an earlier 1990 Precise\nPlan and baldly assert that \"any later designation of the site as 'open space' would have\nbeen a factual error.\" This assertion contradicts the City's position in the approved site\ndevelopment permit and the repeated analyses of City staff. While we need not explore\nthe consequences of such inconsistency in this appeal, since an alternative ground exists\non which to reject CLL's challenge, it is troubling.\n                                              49\n\fcircumstances, a consistency determination is entitled to deference as an extension of a\n\nplanning agency's ' \"unique competence to interpret [its] policies when applying them in\n\nits adjudicatory capacity.\" ' [Citation.] Reviewing courts must defer to a procedurally\n\nproper consistency finding unless no reasonable person could have reached the same\n\nconclusion.\" (Id. at pp. 154-155.) \"The party challenging a city's determination of\n\ngeneral plan consistency has the burden to show why, based on all of the evidence in the\n\nrecord, the determination was unreasonable.\" (San Diego Citizenry Group v. County of\n\nSan Diego (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26.)\n\n       CLL focuses on the project's site's multifamily residential (MF-1) zoning and\n\ncontends that zoning is inconsistent with an open space designation. While \"[a] zoning\n\nordinance that conflicts with a general plan is invalid at the time it is passed\" (Lesher\n\nCommunications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1351609\"><a href=\"/opinion/1351609/lesher-communications-inc-v-city-of-walnut-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 544), the City's\n\nzoning decision is not at issue here. The multifamily residential zoning was implemented\n\nprior to the latest Precise Plan's open space designation. The Precise Plan contemplated a\n\nchange in the site's zoning from multifamily residential to open space, but it appears this\n\nchange has not occurred.\n\n       The issue here is whether the project is consistent with the Precise Plan's open\n\nspace designation. CLL does not persuasively address the reasoning behind the City's\n\nconsistency determination, which was based on previous development at the site. CLL\n\nreferences the general concern for open space, natural vistas, and recreation described in\n\nthe Precise Plan and similar documents, but it does not explain how the City abused its\n\ndiscretion in finding that the development of the school at issue here would be consistent\n\n                                             50\n\fwith the objectives of the open space designation. (CLL's claim that the CVREP trails\n\nwould be affected by the project's use of the trailhead parking lot has been addressed and\n\nrejected above.)\n\n       The City could reasonably conclude that the project was consistent with the\n\nPrecise Plan and its open space designation because the proposed school will be built on\n\nalready developed land, next to a large commercial horse farm, and will be consistent\n\nwith the historic nature of the site. (See Orange Citizens, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 157\n\n[\" '[S]tate law does not require perfect conformity between a proposed project and the\n\napplicable general plan.' \"].) CLL's bare assertion that further evaluation was needed is\n\ninsufficient.\n\n                                            VII\n\n                            Site Development Permit Findings\n\n       CLL contends, based on its previous arguments, that the City's findings in the site\n\ndevelopment permit are not supported by the evidence. We find that contention\n\nunpersuasive for the reasons we have already discussed with respect to CLL's specific\n\narguments above.\n\n\n\n\n                                             51\n\f                                DISPOSITION\n\n    The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                              McCONNELL, P.
