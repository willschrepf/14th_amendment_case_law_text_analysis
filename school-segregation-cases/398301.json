(“Title II of the ADA”).\n\n                     I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Plaintiffs-appellants, Association for Disabled Americans, Inc., Michelle\n\nCalderon, Steve Brother, and Jorge Rodriguez (collectively “appellants”), filed a\n\ncomplaint against defendant-appellee Florida International University (FIU),1\n\nalleging that FIU violated Title II of the ADA by, inter alia, failing to provide\n\nqualified sign language interpreters, failing to provide adequate auxiliary aids and\n\nservices such as effective note takers, and failing to furnish appropriate aids to its\n\nstudents with disabilities such as physical access to certain programs and facilities\n\nat FIU. The complaint sought injunctive relief to prevent the discrimination. FIU\n\nalleged that the appellants’ claim was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n       The district court granted FIU’s motion to dismiss, finding that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment barred appellants’ claims. The appellants appealed and the United\n\n\n       *\n        Honorable John R. Gibson, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n       1\n           FIU is a public university funded by the State of Florida.\n\n                                                   2\n\fStates intervened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2403(a) to defend the constitutionality of\n\nthe abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity in Title II of the ADA.\n\n         This appeal was stayed pending the Supreme Court’s decision in Tennessee\n\nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004), which concerned\n\nthe constitutionality of Title II of the ADA as applied to cases implicating the right\n\nof access to the courts by disabled citizens. In light of Lane, we now turn to the\n\nquestion of whether the Eleventh Amendment bars appellants from suing FIU.\n\n                                    II. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n         The granting of a motion to dismiss based upon Eleventh Amendment\n\nImmunity is subject to de novo review. Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 11\n\nF.3d 1016 (11th Cir. 1994), aff’d 517 U.S. 44, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252\n\n(1996); McDonald v. Hillsborough County School Bd., 821 F.2d 1563 (11th Cir.\n\n1987).\n\nB. Eleventh Amendment Immunity as applied to a Public Education Institution\n\n         Title II of the ADA prescribes that “no qualified individual with a disability\n\nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied\n\nthe benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination by any such entity. 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (emphasis\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fadded).\n\n      The Eleventh Amendment grants States immunity to suits brought by private\n\ncitizens in federal court. U.S. Const. amend. XI. Congress can abrogate that\n\nimmunity where (1) Congress “unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate” the\n\nStates’ sovereign immunity in the statute at issue and (2) “Congress acted pursuant\n\nto a valid grant of constitutional authority.” Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528\n\nU.S. 62, 73, 120 S.Ct. 631, 640, 145 L.Ed.2d. 522 (2000). Congress satisfied the\n\nfirst requirement by writing the following language into Section 12202 of the\n\nADA: “[a] State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the\n\nConstitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court . . . for a\n\nviolation of” the ADA. 42 U.S.C. § 12202. This appeal, therefore, involves the\n\nsecond requirement, i.e. whether the statutory provision removing Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity for private suits under Title II of the ADA is a valid\n\nexercise of Congress’s authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n      “When Congress seeks to remedy or prevent unconstitutional discrimination,\n\n§ 5 [of the Fourteenth Amendment] authorizes it to enact prophylactic legislation\n\nproscribing practices that are discriminatory in effect, if not in intent, to carry out\n\nthe basic objectives of the Equal Protection Clause.” Lane, 124 S.Ct. at 1986. In\n\nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519-20, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2164, 138 L.Ed.2d\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f624 (1997), the Supreme Court held that Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits\n\n“a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied\n\nand the means adopted to that end.” (Emphasis added).\n\n      In order to establish whether Congress’s enactment of Title II of the ADA\n\nsatisfies the Boerne “congruence and proportionality” requirements in the context\n\nof a public education institution, we follow a three-step analysis. See Board of\n\nTrustees v. Garrett, 531U.S. 356, 365-70, 121 S.Ct. 955, 963-66, 148 L.Ed.2d 866\n\n(2001); Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. Under this analysis, we must determine: (1) the\n\nconstitutional right or rights that Congress sought to enforce when it enacted the\n\nADA, (2) whether there was a history of unconstitutional discrimination to support\n\nCongress’s determination that prophylactic legislation was necessary; and (3)\n\nwhether Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal\n\ntreatment. Id. We will discuss each step in turn.\n\n      (1) The Constitutional Right or Rights that Congress Sought to Enforce\n\n      In Tennessee v. Lane, the Supreme Court identified that Title II seeks to\n\nenforce the Fourteenth Amendment’s “prohibition on irrational disability\n\ndiscrimination.” 124 S.Ct. at 1998. Additionally, the Court noted that Title II\n\nseeks to enforce the constitutional guarantees under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment in\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fthe context of access to the courts. Id. The Lane Court concluded that these\n\nheightened rights are subject to “more searching judicial review.” Id.2\n\n       Here, although classifications relating to education only involve rational\n\nbasis review under the Equal Protection Clause, “[b]oth the importance of\n\neducation in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its\n\ndeprivation on the life of the child,” distinguishes public education from other\n\nrights subject to rational basis review. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct.\n\n2382, 2396-97, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). The Supreme Court long has recognized\n\nthat even when discrimination in education does not abridge a fundamental right,\n\nthe gravity of the harm is vast and far reaching. See Brown v. Board of Educ., 347\n\nU.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (“education is perhaps the\n\nmost important function of state and local governments” because “it is doubtful\n\nthat any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the\n\nopportunity of an education”).3 Thus, the constitutional right to equality in\n\n\n       2\n         Although the rights at stake in Lane were fundamental, we note that the Court did not\nspecify the need for a fundamental right to be at stake in order to satisfy this prong of the\ninquiry.\n       3\n         See also San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S.1, 29-30, 93\nS.Ct.1278, 1295, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) (“the grave significance of education both to the\nindividual and to society cannot be doubted”); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213, 92 S.Ct.\n1526, 1532, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972) (“Providing public schools ranks at the very apex of the\nfunction of a State”); Abington Sch. Dist. v. Schempp, 374 U.S.203, 230, 83 S.Ct.1560, 1576, 10\nL.Ed.2d 844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (“Americans regard the public schools as a most\nvital civic institution for the preservation of a democratic system of government”).\n\n                                                6\n\feducation, though not fundamental, is vital to the future success of our society.\n\n      (2) There was a History of Unconstitutional Discrimination\n\n      The Lane Court, in analyzing the second prong of the Boerne congruence\n\nand proportionality test, specifically noted that Congress “document[ed] a pattern\n\nof unequal treatment in the administration of a wide range of public services,\n\nprograms and activities, including the penal system, public education, and voting.”\n\nLane, 124 S.Ct. at 1989 (emphasis added). Under its analysis of this prong, the\n\nSupreme Court considered the record supporting Title II as a whole, and\n\nconclusively held that Congress had documented a sufficient historical predicate of\n\nunconstitutional disability discrimination in the provision of public services to\n\njustify enactment of a prophylactic remedy pursuant to Congress’s authority under\n\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 1992. Therefore, the Supreme\n\nCourt ruled that the second Boerne inquiry was satisfied. Id.; see also, Miller v.\n\nKing, 384 F.3d 1248, 1271 n.25 (11th Cir. 2004) (“the Supreme Court in Lane in\n\neffect has decided the step-two inquiry as to Title II, and we must follow the\n\nSupreme Court’s lead.”). Thus, the second Boerne inquiry is satisfied in this case.\n\n      (3) Title II is an Appropriate Response to This History and Pattern of\n          Unequal Treatment\n\n      The Supreme Court in Lane held that Title II of the ADA, as applied\n\nspecifically to cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts,\n\n                                           7\n\fconstitutes a valid exercise of Congress’s enforcement power under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. 124 S.Ct. at 1992-93. In coming to this conclusion, the Court\n\nemphasized that the congruence and proportionality of the remedies in Title II\n\nshould be judged on an individual or “as-applied” basis in light of the particular\n\nconstitutional rights at stake in the relevant category of public services. Id.\n\nTherefore, we now turn to the question of whether Title II of the ADA, as applied\n\nto access to public education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress’s\n\nenforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we conclude that it does.\n\n       Like the discrimination at issue in Lane, the “unequal treatment of disabled\n\npersons in the administration of” education has a “long history, and has persisted\n\ndespite several legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disability\n\ndiscrimination.”4 124 S.Ct. at 1993. In response to this history, Congress chose a\n\n       4\n         In footnote 12 of the Lane opinion, the Court cited the following examples of state\nsanctioned public school disability discrimination: New York State Assn. for Retarded Children,\nInc. v. Carey, 466 F. Supp. 487, 504 (E.D.N.Y. 1979) (segregation of mentally retarded students\nwith hepatitis B); Mills v. Board of Ed. of District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (D.D.C. 1972)\n(exclusion of mentally retarded students from public school system); Robertson v. Granite City\nCommunity Unit School District No. 9, 684 F. Supp. 1002 (S.D.Ill. 1998) (elementary-school\nstudent with AIDS excluded from attending regular education classes or participating in\nextracurricular activities); Thomas v. Atascadero Unified School District, 662 F. Supp. 376 (C.D.\nCal. 1986) (kindergarten student with AIDS excluded from class). Lane, 124 S.Ct. at 1990 n.12.\nJustice Souter, in concurrence, also pointed to another administrative action that was judicially\napproved where a child was excluded from public school “as a justified precaution against the\nvery sight of a child with cerebral palsy, lest he ‘produc[e] a depressing and nauseating effect’\nupon others.” State ex rel. Beattie v. Board of Ed. Antigo, 169 Wis. 231, 232, 172 N.W. 153\n(1919).\n\n                                                8\n\flimited remedy. Title II only prohibits discrimination by reason of disability. 42\n\nU.S.C. 12132. Therefore, States retain their discretion to exclude persons from\n\nprograms, services, or benefits for any lawful reason unconnected with their\n\ndisability.\n\n       In light of the long history of state discrimination against students with\n\ndisabilities, Congress reasonably concluded that there was a substantial risk for\n\nfuture discrimination. Title II’s prophylactic remedy acts to detect and prevent\n\ndiscrimination against disabled students that could otherwise go undiscovered and\n\nunremedied. By prohibiting insubstantial reasons for denying accommodation to\n\nthe disabled, Title II prevents invidious discrimination and unconstitutional\n\ntreatment in the actions of state officials exercising discretionary powers over\n\ndisabled students. See Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 736,\n\n123 S.Ct. 1972, 1982, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (perceptions based on stereotypes “lead to\n\nsubtle discrimination that may be difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis”).\n\n       Furthermore, Title II requires only “reasonable modifications that would not\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service provided.” Lane, 124 S.Ct. at 1993.\n\nFor example, in its attempt to equalize physical access to public buildings,\n\nCongress imposed reasonable architectural standards for new construction and\n\nallowed for less costly measures for older facilities. See 28 C.F.R. § 35.151; 28\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fC.F.R. § 35.150(b)(1).5\n\n       Discrimination against disabled students in education affects disabled\n\npersons’ future ability to exercise and participate in the most basic rights and\n\nresponsibilities of citizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs\n\nand services. The relief available under Title II of the ADA is congruent and\n\nproportional to the injury and the means adopted to remedy the injury.\n\n                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of FIU’s\n\nmotion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity and REMAND the\n\ncase for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Regulations pursuant to Title II of the ADA create an obligation for a public entity to\nmake reasonable modifications to ensure accessibility to a service, program, or activity. 28\nC.F.R. § 35.150(a). A public entity is excused from this obligation if the proposed action would\nfundamentally alter the “service, program or activity or [would result in] undue financial and\nadministrative burdens.” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150(a)(3).\n\n                                               10\n\f",

Under this analysis, we must determine: (1) the constitutional right or rights that Congress sought to enforce when it enacted the ADA, (2) whether there was a history of unconstitutional discrimination to support Congress's determination that prophylactic legislation was necessary; and (3) whether Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment. <i>Id.</i> We will discuss each step in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Constitutional Right or Rights that Congress Sought to Enforce</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Tennessee v.

Additionally, the Court noted that Title II seeks to enforce the constitutional guarantees under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment in the context of access to the courts. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Lane</i> Court concluded that these heightened rights are subject to \"more searching judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, although classifications relating to education only involve rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause, \"[b]oth the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child,\" distinguishes public education from other rights subject to rational basis review. <i>Plyler v. Doe,</i> 457 U.S. 202, 221, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2396-97, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982). The Supreme Court long has recognized that even when discrimination in education does not abridge a fundamental right, the gravity of the harm is vast and far reaching. <i>See Brown v. Board of Educ.,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 493, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (\"education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments\" because \"it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the constitutional right to equality in education, though not fundamental, is vital to the future success of our society.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) There was a History of Unconstitutional Discrimination</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Lane</i> Court, in analyzing the second prong of the <i>Boerne</i> congruence and proportionality test, specifically noted that Congress \"document [ed] a pattern of unequal treatment in the administration of a wide range of public services, programs and activities, including the penal system, <i>public education,</i> and voting.\" <i>Lane,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1989 (emphasis added). Under its analysis of this prong, the Supreme Court considered the record supporting Title II <i>as a whole,</i> and conclusively held that Congress had documented a sufficient historical predicate of unconstitutional disability discrimination in the provision of public services to justify enactment of a prophylactic remedy pursuant to Congress's authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 1992. Therefore, the Supreme Court ruled that the second <i>Boerne</i> inquiry was satisfied. <i>Id.; see also, Miller v. King,</i> 384 F.3d 1248, 1271 n. 25 (11th Cir.2004) (\"the Supreme Court in <i>Lane</i> in effect has decided the step-two inquiry as to Title II, and we must follow the Supreme Court's lead.\").

In coming to this conclusion, the Court emphasized that the congruence and proportionality of the remedies in Title II should be judged on an individual or \"as-applied\" basis in light of the particular constitutional rights at stake in the relevant category of public services. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, we now turn to the question of whether Title II of the ADA, as applied to access to public education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the following reasons, we conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the discrimination at issue in <i>Lane,</i> the \"unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of\" education has a \"long history, and has persisted despite several legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disability discrimination.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 124 S.Ct. at 1993. In response to this history, Congress chose a limited remedy. Title II only prohibits discrimination by reason of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. Therefore, States retain their discretion to exclude persons from programs, services, or benefits for any lawful reason unconnected with their disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the long history of state discrimination against students with disabilities, Congress reasonably concluded that there was a substantial risk for future discrimination. Title II's prophylactic remedy acts to detect and prevent discrimination against disabled students that could otherwise go undiscovered and unremedied. By prohibiting insubstantial reasons for denying accommodation to the disabled, Title II prevents invidious discrimination and unconstitutional treatment in the actions of state officials exercising discretionary powers over disabled students. <i>See Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v. Hibbs,</i> 538 U.S. 721, 736, 123 S.Ct. 1972, 1982, 155 L.Ed.2d 953 (2003) (perceptions based on stereotypes \"lead to subtle discrimination that may be difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Title II requires only \"reasonable modifications that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided.\" <i>Lane,</i> 124 S.Ct. at 1993. For example, in its attempt to equalize physical access to public buildings, Congress imposed reasonable architectural standards for new construction and allowed for less costly measures for older facilities. See 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.151; 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.150(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discrimination against disabled students in education affects disabled persons' future ability to exercise and participate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs and services.

Under this analysis, we must determine: (1) the constitutional right or rights that Congress sought to enforce when it enacted the ADA, (2) whether there was a history of unconstitutional discrimination to support Congress's determination that prophylactic legislation was necessary; and (3) whether Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment. <i>Id.</i> We will discuss each step in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) The Constitutional Right or Rights that Congress Sought to Enforce</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Tennessee v.

Additionally, the Court noted that Title II seeks to enforce the constitutional guarantees under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment in the context of access to the courts. <i>Id.</i> The <i>Lane</i> Court concluded that these heightened rights are subject to \"more searching judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, although classifications relating to education only involve rational basis review under the Equal Protection Clause, \"[b]oth the importance of education in maintaining our basic institutions, and the lasting impact of its deprivation on the life of the child,\" distinguishes public education from other rights subject to rational basis review. <i>Plyler v.

Under its analysis of this prong, the Supreme Court considered the record supporting Title II <i>as a whole,</i> and conclusively held that Congress had documented a sufficient historical predicate of unconstitutional disability discrimination in the provision of public services to justify enactment of a prophylactic remedy pursuant to Congress's authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> at 1992. Therefore, the Supreme Court ruled that the second <i>Boerne</i> inquiry was satisfied. <i>Id.; see also, Miller v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></span>, 1271 n. 25 (11th Cir.2004) (\"the Supreme Court in <i>Lane</i> in effect has decided the step-two inquiry as to Title II, and we must follow the Supreme Court's lead.\").

In coming to this conclusion, the Court emphasized that the congruence and proportionality of the remedies in Title II should be judged on an individual or \"as-applied\" basis in light of the particular constitutional rights at stake in the relevant category of public services. <i>Id.</i> Therefore, we now turn to the question of whether Title II of the ADA, as applied to access to public education, constitutes a valid exercise of Congress's enforcement power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. For the following reasons, we conclude that it does.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the discrimination at issue in <i>Lane,</i> the \"unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of\" education has a \"long history, and has persisted despite several legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disability discrimination.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> 124 S.Ct. at 1993. In response to this history, Congress chose a limited remedy. Title II only prohibits discrimination by reason of disability. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12132. Therefore, States retain their discretion to exclude persons from programs, services, or benefits for any lawful reason unconnected with their disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the long history of state discrimination against students with disabilities, Congress reasonably concluded that there was a substantial risk for future discrimination. Title II's prophylactic remedy acts to detect and prevent discrimination against disabled students that could otherwise go undiscovered and unremedied. By prohibiting insubstantial reasons for denying accommodation to the disabled, Title II prevents invidious discrimination and unconstitutional treatment in the actions of state officials exercising discretionary powers over disabled students. <i>See Nevada Dep't of Human Res. v.

For example, in its attempt to equalize physical access to public buildings, Congress imposed reasonable architectural standards for new construction and allowed for less costly measures for older facilities. See 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.151; 28 C.F.R. &#167; 35.150(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Discrimination against disabled students in education affects disabled persons' future ability to exercise and participate in the most basic rights and responsibilities of citizenship, such as voting and participation in public programs and services.
