The seemingly rustic and picturesque environment of\nthis area masks a troubling history—the community has been\nplagued with asbestos-related contamination. In 1999, the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) was called in to\naddress disturbing health reports due to asbestos-related con-\ntamination. We must decide whether, in responding to this\nthreat, the EPA exceeded the bounds of its authority to con-\nduct cleanup activities under the Comprehensive Environmen-\ntal Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”),\n42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq. We hold that it did not.\n\n   Defendants W.R. Grace & Co.,1 Kootenai Development\n   1\n     Although the case caption has remained consistent, we note that the\ndistrict court’s order states that the parties stipulated to the dismissal of\nW.R. Grace. & Co., a Delaware corporation that was incorporated in 1998\nand is the sole shareholder of W.R. Grace & Co.-Conn. United States v.\nW.R. Grace & Co.-Conn., 280 F. Supp. 2d 1135, 1139 n.1 (D. Mont.\n2002) (“Grace I”).\n\f15536          UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nCorporation, and W.R. Grace & Co.-Conn. (collectively,\n“Grace”) do not dispute that they are financially obligated\nunder CERCLA to assist with the cleanup of asbestos origi-\nnating from their former mining and processing operations\nnear Libby.2 Instead, Grace contests the EPA’s characteriza-\ntion of the cleanup as a removal action rather than a remedial\naction under CERCLA. If the cleanup is a remedial action,\nwhich is often characterized as a permanent cleanup, then\nGrace argues that the EPA did not fulfill the regulatory\nrequirements for remedial actions. For example, a remedial\naction requires certain analysis of the costs and effectiveness\nof the remediation and also requires inclusion on the National\nPriority List. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 300.425(b)(1), 300.430(e)(7).\nIn contrast, the regulatory requirements for removal actions,\nwhich provide the EPA with substantial flexibility to tailor\nprompt and effective responses to immediate threats to human\nhealth and the environment, are considerably relaxed.\n\n   Grace argues that the EPA circumvented the regulatory\nsafeguards by conducting a remedial action under the guise of\na removal, thereby giving the EPA free rein to conduct what\nGrace styles as “the quintessential remedial action” under the\nless-restrictive requirements applied to removals. Grace pre-\nsents this as a legal question: Is the EPA’s characterization of\nits activities in Libby as a removal action correct as a matter\nof law?\n\n   Grace further contends that even if the action is appropri-\nately classified as a removal action, the district court erred in\nexempting the action from CERCLA’s general 12-month, $2\nmillion cap for removal actions and in granting the EPA over\n$54 million in reimbursement plus a declaratory judgment for\n  2\n   In February 2005, the United States unsealed a criminal indictment\ncharging Grace and various of its employees with offenses relating to\nknowingly exposing miners and Libby residents to asbestos. See Charges\nIssued Over Asbestos at a Mine, N.Y. Times, Feb. 8, 2005, at A16. This\npending indictment does not affect these proceedings.\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15537\nfuture costs. Finally, Grace disputes the accounting methods\nused to calculate the EPA’s indirect costs.\n\n   The situation confronting the EPA in Libby is truly extraor-\ndinary. This cleanup site is not a remote, abandoned mine.\nRather, the population of Libby and nearby communities,\nwhich the EPA estimates at about 12,000, faces ongoing, per-\nvasive exposure to asbestos particles being released through\ndocumented exposure pathways. We cannot escape the fact\nthat people are sick and dying as a result of this continuing\nexposure. Confronted with this information, the EPA deter-\nmined on the basis of its professional judgment, and in accord\nwith its administrative interpretation of the scope of removal\nactions, that the situation warranted an immediate, aggressive\nresponse to abate the public health threat.\n\n   Although we diverge from the district court’s reasoning in\nsome respects, we reach the same ultimate conclusion: The\nEPA’s cleanup in Libby was a removal action that was\nexempt from the temporal and monetary cap. In light of the\nEPA’s expertise in this area, we owe considerable deference,\nalbeit not necessarily full Chevron deference, to its character-\nization of the cleanup activities as a removal action. See\nChevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S.\n837 (1984). We therefore affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n   The outcome of this case is controlled by our interpretation\nof key provisions of CERCLA, a comprehensive statutory\nscheme to respond to environmental threats, obtain compensa-\ntion from those responsible for the polluting activities, and\nassign liability to responsible parties. See Pub. L. No. 96-510,\n94 Stat. 2767 (1980). Before applying CERCLA to the case\nat hand, we begin with a brief review of this statute as well\nas the background on the hazards afflicting Libby.\n\f15538            UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nI.   CERCLA\n\n   A key component of CERCLA was the establishment of a\ntrust fund, commonly known as “Superfund,” for use when\nresponding to the release or threat of release of hazardous\nsubstances into the environment. See CERCLA, Subtitle B–\nEstablishment of Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund\n§ 221, 94 Stat. at 2801-02; see also Superfund Amendments\nand Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-499, 100\nStat. 1613 (1986). Today, Superfund expenditures are directed\nby the provisions of CERCLA and the National Oil and Haz-\nardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (“National\nContingency Plan”), 40 C.F.R. pt. 300.3\n\n   CERCLA and the National Contingency Plan divide\nresponse actions into two broad categories: removal actions\nand remedial actions. See 42 U.S.C. § 9601(25). Removal\nactions4 are typically described as time-sensitive responses to\n   3\n     The National Contingency Plan “specifies procedures for preparing and\nresponding to contaminations and was promulgated by the [EPA] pursuant\nto CERCLA.” Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Aviall Servs., Inc., 543 U.S. ___, 125\nS. Ct. 577, 580 n.2 (2004); see also 42 U.S.C. § 9605. Last revised in\n1994, see 59 Fed. Reg. 47,384 (Sept. 15, 1994), the National Contingency\nPlan has undergone several rounds of revisions since its initial publication.\n   4\n     Although “removal action” is not itself defined in CERCLA, “remove”\nand “removal” are defined. In light of the central importance of the defini-\ntion to this case, it is worth citing the rather cumbersome definition in its\nentirety:\n     The terms “remove” or “removal” means the cleanup or removal\n     of released hazardous substances from the environment, such\n     actions as may be necessary [sic] taken in the event of the threat\n     of release of hazardous substances into the environment, such\n     actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the\n     release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal\n     of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may\n     be necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the\n     public health or welfare or to the environment, which may other-\n     wise result from a release or threat of release. The term includes,\n     in addition, without being limited to, security fencing or other\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                   15539\npublic health threats for which the EPA is granted consider-\nable leeway in structuring the cleanup. See, e.g., Minnesota v.\nKalman W. Abrams Metals, Inc., 155 F.3d 1019, 1024 (8th\nCir. 1998) (describing “removal actions” as “those taken to\ncounter imminent and substantial threats to public health and\nwelfare”). Superfund-financed removal actions generally are\nrequired to “be terminated after $2 million has been obligated\nfor the action or 12 months have elapsed from the date\nremoval activities begin on-site.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5).\nThese limitations are not, however, inviolate. The EPA5 may\nexceed this cap if it determines one of two exemptions\napplies:\n\n     (i) There is an immediate risk to public health or\n     welfare of the United States or the environment; con-\n     tinued response actions are immediately required to\n     prevent, limit, or mitigate an emergency; and such\n     assistance will not otherwise be provided on a timely\n     basis; or\n\n     (ii) Continued response action is otherwise appro-\n     priate and consistent with the remedial action to be\n     taken.\n\n40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5); see also 42 U.S.C. § 9604(c)(1).\n\n   Remedial actions,6 on the other hand, are often described as\n\n    measures to limit access, provision of alternative water supplies,\n    temporary evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not\n    otherwise provided for, action taken under section 9604(b) of this\n    title, and any emergency assistance which may be provided under\n    the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\n42 U.S.C. § 9601(23).\n   5\n     In Executive Orders 12,580 and 12,777, the President delegated most\nfunctions and responsibilities to the EPA that were vested in him by CER-\nCLA. See 40 C.F.R. § 300.100.\n   6\n     As with “removal,” the definition of “remedial action” has a maze-like\nstructure:\n\f15540           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\npermanent remedies to threats for which an urgent response\nis not warranted. See, e.g., Pub. Serv. Co. of Colo. v. Gates\nRubber Co., 175 F.3d 1177, 1182 (10th Cir. 1999) (“In broad\ncontrast, a remedial action seeks to effect a permanent remedy\nto the release of hazardous substances when there is no imme-\ndiate threat to the public health.”).\n\n   The distinction between removal and remedial actions is\ncritical under CERCLA because “[b]oth types of actions have\nsubstantial requirements, but the requirements for remedial\nactions are much more detailed and onerous.” Morrison\n\n    The terms “remedy” or “remedial action” means those actions\n    consistent with permanent remedy taken instead of or in addition\n    to removal actions in the event of a release or threatened release\n    of a hazardous substance into the environment, to prevent or min-\n    imize the release of hazardous substances so that they do not\n    migrate to cause substantial danger to present or future public\n    health or welfare or the environment. The term includes, but is\n    not limited to, such actions at the location of the release as stor-\n    age, confinement, perimeter protection using dikes, trenches, or\n    ditches, clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released hazardous\n    substances and associated contaminated materials, recycling or\n    reuse, diversion, destruction, segregation of reactive wastes,\n    dredging or excavations, repair or replacement of leaking con-\n    tainers, collection of leachate and runoff, onsite treatment or\n    incineration, provision of alternative water supplies, and any\n    monitoring reasonably required to assure that such actions protect\n    the public health and welfare and the environment. The term\n    includes the costs of permanent relocation of residents and busi-\n    nesses and community facilities where the President determines\n    that, alone or in combination with other measures, such reloca-\n    tion is more cost-effective than and environmentally preferable to\n    the transportation, storage, treatment, destruction, or secure dis-\n    position offsite of hazardous substances, or may otherwise be\n    necessary to protect the public health or welfare; the term\n    includes offsite transport and offsite storage, treatment, destruc-\n    tion, or secure disposition of hazardous substances and associated\n    contaminated materials.\n42 U.S.C. § 9601(24).\n\f               UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                  15541\nEnters. v. McShares, Inc., 302 F.3d 1127, 1136 (10th Cir.\n2002). For example, remedial actions are only eligible for\nSuperfund financing when the site is listed on the National\nPriorities List.7 See 40 C.F.R. § 300.425(b)(1). Further, the\nEPA is required to consider costs when selecting remedial\nalternatives whereas “CERCLA contains no corresponding\nmandate for removal actions.” United States v. Hardage, 982\nF.2d 1436, 1443 (10th Cir. 1992); see also 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.430 (listing requirements for a selection of remedy\nincluding consideration of effectiveness, permanence, and\ncost). Because CERCLA provides that responsible parties\nshall be liable for “all costs of removal or remedial action\nincurred by the United States Government . . . not inconsistent\nwith the national contingency plan,” this distinction is vital to\nthose held liable. 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4).\n\nII.    HISTORY OF THE EPA’S CLEANUP ACTIVITIES IN LIBBY\n\n  The roots of this case stretch back nearly a century to the\nbeginning of mining operations in the vicinity of Libby. It\nwas not until the late 1990s, however, that the extent of the\nproblem came to light fully, leading to the EPA’s cleanup\naction.\n\n  A.    ASBESTOS CONTAMINATION IN LIBBY\n\n   From the 1920s until 1990, Grace and its predecessors\nmined and processed vermiculite—a mineral containing a\ntype of asbestos called tremolite—at a mine approximately\nseven miles northeast of Libby. See Grace I at 1138-41\n(describing factual background in an order granting the EPA’s\nmotion for summary judgment). Processed ore was trucked to\nscreening plants and expansion/export plants from which the\n  7\n   The National Priorities List is “the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to\nCERCLA section 105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases in the\nUnited States that are priorities for long-term remedial evaluation and\nresponse.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.5.\n\f15542        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nmaterials were distributed nationwide. Vermiculite was also\navailable for employees to take home for their personal use,\nand Grace donated vermiculite to the local schools.\n\n   Although Grace did not cease mining and processing opera-\ntions in Libby until 1990, state and federal agencies con-\nducted studies on the health effects of the mining operations\nas early as the 1940s. These efforts were, however, focused\non workplace exposure rather than contamination in the\ngreater Libby community. For example, in the 1940s and\n1950s, the Montana State Board of Health issued several\nindustrial hygiene studies to determine whether the mine’s\noperations were detrimental to the employees’ health. In\n1992, the EPA issued a written determination on the applica-\nbility of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants to a road on the mine property. However, no CER-\nCLA activities were performed in Libby prior to the EPA’s\ncommencement of an investigation in 1999 that led to the cur-\nrent cleanup.\n\n  B.    THE EPA’S INVOLVEMENT IN LIBBY\n\n   After beginning its investigation in November 1999, the\nEPA issued a Sampling and Quality Assurance Project Plan\nin December, followed by a more comprehensive revised plan\nin January 2000. The plan “address[ed] questions and con-\ncerns raised by citizens of Libby regarding possible ongoing\nexposures to asbestos fibers as a result of historical mining,\nprocessing and exportation of asbestos-containing vermicu-\nlite.” The EPA’s immediate efforts were directed toward (1)\nobtaining information on airborne asbestos levels in order to\njudge whether a time-critical intervention was needed to pro-\ntect public health, and (2) obtaining data on friable asbestos\nlevels in potentially contaminated materials around Libby.\nThe EPA stated that “[t]he first decision to be made is\nwhether or not time-critical intervention is needed to protect\npublic health.”\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.           15543\n   In his testimony before the Senate’s Environment and Pub-\nlic Works Committee in February 2000, the EPA’s regional\nadministrator attested that the initial investigation confirmed\ntwo things: (1) “a large number of current and historic cases\nof asbestos related diseases centered around Libby,” including\n“33 incidents of apparently non-occupational exposures”; and\n(2) a “high likelihood that significant amounts of asbestos\ncontaminated vermiculite still remain in and around Libby.”\nVermiculite from the mine’s waste piles was “commonly used\nby local residents in their yards and gardens as a soil condi-\ntioner.” It was also used to create running tracks and baseball\nfields for nearby schools. The residents were particularly con-\ncerned because children regularly played in and around piles\nof vermiculite. These findings compelled the EPA to under-\ntake more expansive testing. To put it mildly, subsequent test-\ning showed asbestos contamination to be pervasive.\n\n   Because asbestos is generally only harmful if inhaled or\ningested, the mere presence of asbestos does not necessarily\nconstitute an immediate threat. But the situation in Libby did\nnot present this benign scenario. Instead, the EPA docu-\nmented “complete human exposure pathways” through which\nasbestos particles were becoming airborne as a result of nor-\nmal human activities, such as foot traffic and vacuuming, and\nnatural forces, such as wind—especially during the dry sum-\nmer months. This migration transformed the latent threat of\nundisturbed asbestos into a current hazard to anyone breathing\nthe airborne particles. For example, residents described halt-\ning baseball games when large dust clouds swept over the\nfield carrying particles from exposed piles of vermiculite. A\nstudy of Libby residents conducted in 2000 by the Agency for\nToxic Substances and Disease Registry not only found that\nmost participants reported multiple routes of exposure, but\nalso that 18% of those x-rayed had abnormalities in the lining\nof their lungs—as compared with the expected rate of 0.2%\nto 2.3% for groups living in the United States who have no\nknown asbestos exposures.\n\f15544           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   These findings led the EPA to set out the intended removal\naction in a series of three memoranda issued between May\n2000 and May 2002, which progressively broadened the\nscope of the cleanup. The original action memorandum, dated\nMay 23, 2000 (“First Action Memo”), covered a former ver-\nmiculite export plant and screening plant, the former of which\nwas being used as a retail lumber mill and the latter as a com-\nbined commercial/residential property.8 The First Action\nMemo authorized a time-critical removal action9 to be com-\npleted by spring/summer 2001 with a total project ceiling of\napproximately $5.8 million for the two sites. The EPA deter-\nmined that the action met the requirements to exceed the $2\nmillion, 12-month cap because the asbestos in the environ-\nment posed an immediate threat to the local population; a\ncleanup beyond the cap was required to prevent, limit, or miti-\ngate an emergency because of the size of the cleanup and the\nshort construction season; and assistance from other govern-\nment agencies was not anticipated on a timely basis.\n\n   The EPA then broadened the scope of the cleanup in an\naction memorandum amendment, dated July 20, 2001\n(“Second Action Memo”), which covered “newly identified\nrisks” at six additional locations and requested increased\nfunding for costs associated with Grace’s reported denial of\n  8\n     Grace largely conducted the cleanup of the export plant in response to\nan EPA order dated May 23, 2000.\n   9\n     The EPA describes the cleanup in Libby as a single removal action\nboth in the action memoranda and its briefs to this court: “EPA authorized\na removal action to remove asbestos-contaminated materials from hun-\ndreds of homes, businesses, yards, gardens, school athletic fields, drive-\nways, and mining plant facilities.” (emphasis added). Likewise, on appeal,\nGrace argues that the district court erred “by granting the United States\nsummary judgment with respect to the validity of EPA’s characterization\nof the Libby response action as a removal rather than a remedial action.”\nAccordingly, we analyze the EPA’s activities in Libby as a single response\naction rather than a patchwork of discrete smaller actions. Cf. Colorado\nv. Sunoco, Inc., 337 F.3d 1233, 1241 (10th Cir. 2003) (concluding that\nthere can be but one “removal action” per site).\n\f                   UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                   15545\naccess to the screening plant. The six sites included two pri-\nvate residences, three local schools, and a public road running\npast the mine site. Among the EPA’s foremost concerns were\nthe high asbestos concentrations in the materials at these sites\nand the easily crumbled state of the exposed asbestos. For\nexample, the EPA found nuggets of tremolite around the high\nschool track that it described as “readily friable, releasing\ncopious amounts of fibers upon degradation.” The EPA mea-\nsured asbestos concentrations of 2% by polarized light\nmicroscopy (“PLM”) at a pile of vermiculite at one residence,\nand concentrations up to 1.5% in material scraped off equip-\nment at the other residence.10 Samples taken from materials\nvisible outside the elementary school indicated that the area\ncontained asbestos at levels between 3% to 8% by PLM, and\ntesting at the road showed asbestos concentrations up to 5%.\nAs with the First Action Memo, the EPA determined that the\nsituation warranted an exemption from the cap and, conse-\nquently, authorized a total site removal ceiling of approxi-\nmately $20.1 million with an estimated completion date for\nmost of the work by winter 2001/02.\n\n  The EPA expanded the removal action again in an action\nmemorandum amendment, dated May 2, 2002 (“Third Action\nMemo”), which brought a number of homes and businesses in\n  10\n    To put these numbers into perspective, in the First Action Memo, the\nEPA explained how asbestos concentrations in soil translate into risks to\nthe public health:\n       Currently EPA has not established, under any of its regulatory\n       programs, an asbestos level in soil below which an exposure does\n       not pose a risk. The 1% cut-off level for regulation under the\n       Toxic Substances Control Act abatement program was estab-\n       lished on the basis of analytical capability at the time, and was\n       not established based on the level of risk represented. To the con-\n       trary, at Superfund sites in California EPA Region IX found in\n       certain settings that concentrations of asbestos less than 1%\n       posed unacceptable inhalation risks when subject to disturbance\n       by traffic.\nSignificantly, the asbestos was in a friable state.\n\f15546           UNITED STATES v.

In addition, although Libby was not added to the\nNational Priorities List until October 2002, see 67 Fed. Reg.\n65,315 (Oct. 24, 2002), the EPA proposed that the site be\nadded in February 2002. The Third Action Memo also\nexplained that the removal action was consistent with a\nplanned future remedial action.11 The EPA estimated that the\nproposed work would take two to three construction seasons,\nand it raised the total project ceiling to approximately $55.6\nmillion. The EPA continued removal activities consistent with\nits various Action Memos.12\n\n  C.    COST-RECOVERY ACTION AGAINST GRACE\n\n   The EPA filed suit against Grace in March 2001 seeking\nrecovery of all response costs incurred by the government and\na declaration that Grace would be liable for future costs. See\n42 U.S.C. §§ 9607, 9613(g)(2). In December 2002, the district\ncourt granted the EPA summary judgment on the liability\nissue but determined that there were material issues of fact\nregarding costs associated with certain properties. Grace I,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 1148.\n\n   After a three-day bench trial, the district court issued an\norder awarding the EPA the full $54.53 million in reimburse-\nment requested, including $11.32 million in indirect costs,\nand granting a declaratory judgment that Grace would be lia-\nble for future cleanup costs. United States v. W.R. Grace &\n  11\n      The EPA proposed that the Libby site be added to the National Priori-\nties List in February 2002 so that a remedial response action could be con-\nducted. In October 2002, the site was officially added to the List. See 67\nFed. Reg. 65,315 (Oct. 24, 2002).\n   12\n      According to the EPA’s CERCLIS database, the EPA currently is in\nthe study and remedy selection phase and a final remedy has not been\nselected for the Libby site. See http://cfpub1.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/\ncsitinfo.cfm?id=0801744 (last visited July 26, 2005).\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                  15547\nCo., 280 F. Supp. 2d 1149 (D. Mont. 2003) (“Grace II”). This\nappeal followed.\n\n                               ANALYSIS\n\n   The EPA’s ability to recover the costs of its cleanup in\nLibby hinges on whether its response is properly character-\nized as a removal action, as argued by the EPA and found by\nthe district court, or a remedial action, as argued by Grace.13\nThe tangled language of CERCLA hardly lends itself to clear-\ncut distinctions between the two types of actions. Nonethe-\nless, certain overarching attributes emerge with the time-\nsensitivity of the threat and the significance of the public\nhealth threat as key factors underlying removal actions. In\nLibby, the EPA determined that there was a serious threat to\npublic health that required a time-sensitive response, and it\nacted on this information.\n\n   We emphasize at the outset that the EPA’s response action\nin Libby is no mere run-of-the-mill CERCLA cleanup. As the\nEPA itself recognizes, the Libby cleanup is a unique removal\naction of a size and cost not previously seen. But the situation\nin Libby was, and remains today, truly extraordinary.\n\n\n\n\n  13\n     Under CERCLA’s burden-shifting procedures, once the EPA estab-\nlishes its prima facie case for response costs, the burden shifts to Grace\nto prove that the response was inconsistent with the National Contingency\nPlan. See United States v. Chapman, 146 F.3d 1166, 1169 (9th Cir. 1998).\nSpecifically, CERCLA provides that responsible parties shall be liable for\n“all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States\nGovernment . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.” 42\nU.S.C. § 9607(a)(4). Because the National Contingency Plan prescribes\nheightened requirements for a remedial action, a threshold inquiry is\nwhether the action was a removal or remedial action. The EPA does not\ndispute that the cleanup did not meet the National Contingency Plan’s pro-\ncedural requirements for a remedial action.\n\f15548        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nI.   REMOVAL OR REMEDIAL ACTION: STRUCTURE OF THE\n     TWO-STEP INQUIRY AND APPLICATION TO THE CLEANUP IN\n     LIBBY\n\n   The district court concluded, based on an arbitrary and\ncapricious standard of review, that “[the EPA’s] decision to\nconduct a removal action rather than a remedial action is con-\nsistent with the [National Contingency Plan] and cannot be\nsecond-guessed by this Court.” Grace I, 280 F. Supp. 2d at\n1143. We take a slightly different tack. CERCLA provides\nthat the selection of response actions shall be upheld “unless\narbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with\nthe law.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2). We agree that it was not\narbitrary and capricious for the EPA “to approve a time-\ncritical removal action.” Id. at 1144. However, the statutory\nscheme compels us to take the inquiry one step further. See\nMartinez-Villareal v. Lewis, 80 F.3d 1301, 1305 (9th Cir.\n1996) (“We may affirm on any ground supported by the\nrecord even if it differs from the rationale of the district\ncourt.”).\n\n   [1] Under CERCLA, once the response action is selected—\nin this case as a removal based on “an imminent and substan-\ntial danger to the public health”—then the EPA is authorized\nto take necessary actions consistent with the National Contin-\ngency Plan. See 42 U.S.C. § 9604(a)(1). Regulations imple-\nmenting the Plan provide that “[i]f the [EPA] determines that\na removal action is appropriate, actions shall, as appropriate,\nbegin as soon as possible to abate, prevent, minimize, stabi-\nlize, mitigate, or eliminate the threat to public health or wel-\nfare of the United States or the environment.” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(b)(3). Thus, even if the EPA’s selection of a\nremoval action was proper, the question remains whether the\nactions actually taken by the EPA to combat the threat are\nproperly categorized as such.\n\n  We agree with Grace that this second step of our inquiry is\na question of law: Does the EPA’s response action in Libby\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                  15549\nfall within the statutory limits of a removal action? Grace’s\nchallenge is built on the premise that the EPA termed its\ncleanup in Libby a removal action as a subterfuge when the\nresponse was, in substance, a remedial action.14 To resolve\nthis question, we must explore the statutory confines of\nremoval actions under CERCLA and, within this legal struc-\nture, ask to what extent we should defer to the EPA’s interpre-\ntation based on the agency’s expertise.\n\n  A.       DECISION TO CONDUCT A REMOVAL ACTION IN LIBBY\n\n   The EPA’s initial decision to conduct a removal action\nmust be upheld unless Grace can demonstrate on the adminis-\ntrative record that the decision was arbitrary and capricious or\notherwise not in accordance with law. 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\nGrace has not met this burden.\n\n  [2] The National Contingency Plan requires the EPA to\nconsider a series of factors15 to determine that it was appropri-\n  14\n      Grace attributes the timing and scope of the EPA’s cleanup to intense\nmedia attention regarding conditions in Libby. We have previously\nrejected an “ulterior motive” analysis in a challenge to whether CERCLA\nresponse costs incurred by a private landowner were necessary: “The issue\nis not why the landowner decided to undertake the cleanup, but whether\nit was necessary. To hold otherwise would result in a disincentive for\ncleanup.” Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp., 270 F.3d 863, 871-\n72 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citation omitted). This logic applies with\nequal force when the EPA is a party. We therefore do not inquire into the\nEPA’s subjective motives behind the cleanup, but rather ask if the objec-\ntive evidence supports the response.\n   15\n      40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2) provides that “[t]he following factors shall\nbe considered in determining the appropriateness of a removal action\n. . . :”\n       (i) Actual or potential exposure to nearby human populations,\n       animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollu-\n       tants or contaminants;\n       (ii) Actual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies\n       or sensitive ecosystems;\n\f15550           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nate to initiate a removal action. Cf. Chapman, 146 F.3d at\n1171-73 (holding that the EPA did not act arbitrarily or capri-\nciously in ordering a removal action after considering the\n§ 300.415(b)(2) factors). The EPA did so and its findings are\nextensively documented.\n\n   The First Action Memo discusses five of the eight factors16\nin concluding that the conditions in Libby presented an immi-\nnent and substantial threat to human health and the environ-\nment that met the regulatory criteria. Chief among the factors\nwas that complete exposure pathways existed through which\npeople were being exposed to asbestos. The First Action\nMemo details specific threats, including that “there are over\n3000 three gallon buckets of unexpanded Libby vermiculite”\nbeing used at a mushroom farm at the former screening plant,\nand that surface soils contained visible vermiculite that could\nreadily migrate.\n\n   The magnitude of the current and potential impact on pub-\nlic health resulting from the widespread use of vermiculite by\nLibby residents led the EPA in its Second Action Memo to\n\n    (iii) Hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in\n    drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk storage containers, that may\n    pose a threat of release;\n    (iv) High levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or contam-\n    inants in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate;\n    (v) Weather conditions that may cause hazardous substances or\n    pollutants or contaminants to migrate or be released;\n    (vi) Threat of fire or explosion;\n    (vii) The availability of other appropriate federal or state\n    response mechanisms to respond to the release; and\n     (viii) Other situations or factors that may pose threats to public\n     health or welfare of the United States or the environment.\n  16\n     Specifically, the memo invokes the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sev-\nenth factors listed in 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2).\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.           15551\ninvoke the catch-all eighth factor—“[o]ther situations or fac-\ntors that may pose threats to public health or welfare of the\nUnited States or the environment,” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)\n(2)(viii):\n\n    The sheer magnitude of the medical impact in Libby\n    dictates the need for an expedient and thorough\n    response. Unfortunately, because of the latencies of\n    asbestos related diseases there is no easy way to\n    directly correlate exposure to amphibole asbestos\n    today to the direct development of an asbestos\n    related disease. The only way to determine this for\n    certain is to observe an individual for 10 to 40 years\n    after exposure to see if they become sick. However,\n    waiting for this type of certainty is unconscionable.\n    CERCLA was designed and enacted to prevent ill-\n    ness and death resulting from exposure to hazardous\n    substances, not wait for its occurrence to prove a\n    threat.\n\n   [3] Finally, the Third Action Memo cites several factors in\nsupport of the EPA’s decision to expand the removal action\nand asserts that “[t]he significant medical impact of asbestos\nexposure in Libby dictates the need for an expedient and thor-\nough response.” In light of the EPA’s carefully documented\nreasoning in the three Action Memos, we agree with the dis-\ntrict court that the EPA’s decision to approve a removal action\nwas not arbitrary and capricious. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\nThis threshold decision does not, however, end our inquiry.\nWe must consider how to classify the EPA’s action.\n\n  B.   CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EPA’S RESPONSE ACTION\n\n   The question remains whether the steps actually taken by\nthe EPA to combat the threat are properly characterized as a\nremoval action. Whether the EPA’s cleanup activity was a\nremoval action—or, on the other hand, a remedial action in\nremoval action’s clothing—is a question of statutory interpre-\n\f15552         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\ntation. “Congress provided definitions for ‘removal’ and\n‘remedial action,’ and the classification of the activity is\ndetermined as a matter of law.” Geraghty & Miller, Inc. v.\nConoco Inc., 234 F.3d 917, 925-26 (5th Cir. 2000) (footnotes\nomitted); see also Sunoco, 337 F.3d at 1242 (“Nothing in [42\nU.S.C.] § 9613(j)(2) refers to the EPA’s characterization of a\nparticular action [as a removal or remedial action].”). The\ndecision to select a removal or remedial action is therefore\ndistinct from the question whether the action carried out was,\nin fact, the action selected. It is to this crucial inquiry that we\nnow turn.\n\n   The statutory interpretation of “removal” is a legal issue\nthat we review as a matter of law. See Carson Harbor Vill.,\n270 F.3d at 870. But in addressing the statute, the parties dis-\nagree as to the level of deference, if any, that we should grant\nthe EPA’s formulation of the term “removal.” Resolving this\nquestion requires that we consider the Supreme Court’s recent\nrefinement of the traditional agency-deference analysis under\nChevron. See 467 U.S. at 842-45; United States v. Mead\nCorp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001) (Chevron applies “when\nit appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the\nagency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.”).\n\n   Following Mead, the continuum of agency deference has\nbeen fraught with ambiguity. Compare Barnhart v. Walton,\n535 U.S 212, 221 (2002) (applying Chevron deference even\nthough the EPA reached its interpretation through means less\nformal than “notice and comment” rulemaking) with Mead,\n533 U.S. at 226-27 (agency’s tariff classification had “no\nclaim to judicial deference under Chevron, there being no\nindication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry the\nforce of law”). Our decisions understandably have been con-\nflicted as to whether Chevron deference only applies upon\nformal rulemaking and whether lesser deference applies in\nother situations. See, e.g., Cal. Dep’t of Soc. Servs. v. Thomp-\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.              15553\nson, 321 F.3d 835, 847-48 (9th Cir. 2003) (discussing how\nMead and Walton have “further obscured the already murky\nadministrative law surrounding Chevron”); Davis v. United\nStates EPA, 348 F.3d 772, 779 n.5 (9th Cir. 2003) (“The mere\nfact that the EPA engaged in informal agency adjudication . . .\ndoes not vitiate the Chevron deference owed to the agency’s\ninterpretation . . . .”). As Justice Scalia presciently noted in his\ndissent in Mead, “We will be sorting out the consequences of\nthe Mead doctrine, which has today replaced the Chevron\ndoctrine, for years to come.” 533 U.S. at 239 (Scalia, J., dis-\nsenting).\n\n   The Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncement in\nNational Cable & Telecommunications Ass’n v. Brand X\nInternet Services, 125 S.Ct. 2688 (2005), calls into question\nwhether Mead in fact “replaced” Chevron as Justice Scalia\ncontends. Perhaps because Brand X involved formal rulemak-\ning, see id. at 2699, the Court did not clarify whether there is\na “deference distinction” between Chevron and Mead. None-\ntheless, in Brand X the majority’s language explaining Chev-\nron is quite broad and does not come with a proviso that the\nChevron deference is limited to agency interpretations\nexpressed through formal rulemaking. See id. (“In Chevron,\nthis Court held that ambiguities in statutes within an agency’s\njurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.”); id. at\n2700 (“Chevron’s premise is that it is for agencies, not courts,\nto fill statutory gaps.”).\n\n  The interplay between Chevron and Mead is highlighted in\nJustice Breyer’s concurrence, in which he writes that “the\nexistence of a formal rulemaking proceeding is neither a nec-\nessary nor a sufficient condition for according Chevron defer-\nence to an agency’s interpretation of a statute.” Id. at 2712\n(Breyer, J., concurring). This explanation stands in contrast to\nJustice Scalia’s dissents in Brand X and Mead. See id. at\n2713-21; Mead, 533 U.S. at 239-61. Echoing his dissent in\nMead, Justice Scalia proffers in his Brand X dissent that\n\f15554        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n“Mead drastically limited the categories of agency action that\nwould qualify for deference under Chevron.” 125 S.Ct. at\n2718 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Rather than clarifying what these\ncategories are, Justice Scalia advances that, in Brand X, the\nCourt “continues the administrative-law improvisation project\nit began four years ago in [Mead].” Id.\n\n   Because the discussion in Brand X leaves some doubt as to\nthe degree of formality of the underlying agency interpreta-\ntion that is required for Chevron deference, we look to the\npost-Mead Supreme Court decision that most closely resem-\nbles the circumstances we face here. The Court explained last\nyear in Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v.\nEPA, 540 U.S. 461, 487-88 (2004), that the EPA’s interpreta-\ntion of a statute in internal guidance memoranda warrants\nrespect but does not qualify for Chevron deference. Although\nthe Court cited Mead in rejecting Chevron deference, it\naccorded “respect” to the “EPA’s reading of the relevant stat-\nutory provisions.” Id. at 488. Accordingly, at a minimum, we\nimpose a modified deference standard affording respect to the\nEPA’s informal interpretations here. But either under modi-\nfied deference or full Chevron deference, the result would be\nthe same: The EPA’s cleanup activities in Libby are properly\ncategorized as a removal action.\n\n   [4] Despite the EPA’s insistence that arbitrary and capri-\ncious review applies to all aspects of our inquiry, the statute\ndoes not support this reading. CERCLA requires that we\nuphold the EPA’s “decision in selecting the response action”\nunless arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance\nwith the law. 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2). Here we address not the\nEPA’s selection of its remedy, but rather whether the actions\ntaken fall within the statutory definition of a removal. Thus,\nwe consider whether the statutory construction that the EPA\nadvances in this litigation is correct as a matter of law. The\ndegree of deference granted to the EPA’s interpretation of a\nstatute is considered in light of Chevron and its progeny. See\nAlaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation, 540 U.S. at 487-88. In\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                    15555\ncontrast, an agency’s actions exercised under its statutory\nauthority are generally subject to arbitrary and capricious\nreview. See id. at 496-97 (applying arbitrary and capricious\nreview to the EPA’s taken actions under the Clean Air Act);\nsee also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (applying arbitrary and capricious\nreview to agency conclusions and findings).\n\n   With the Supreme Court’s recent agency-deference cases as\na backdrop, we begin with Chevron’s first step and ask\n“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question\nat issue,” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, i.e., whether a response\naction such as the one carried out in Libby is a removal or\nremedial action.17 If Congress has “unambiguously expressed\n[its] intent,” then our inquiry ends there, for that intent must\nbe given effect as law. Id. at 842-43. If, however, the statute\nis ambiguous, then we look to the EPA’s interpretation of the\nstatute. Even if full-blown Chevron deference is not due\nbecause of the informal nature of the interpretation, we will\nstill accord a modified level of respect because “Chevron did\nnothing to eliminate Skidmore’s[18] holding that an agency’s\n  17\n      Although we have touched on the interplay between removal and\nremedial actions under CERCLA in prior decisions, the specific contexts\nin which those cases arose render them of limited use to our decision here.\nSee California v. Neville Chem. Co., 358 F.3d 661, 667, 670 (9th Cir.\n2004) (concluding that for the purposes of “the onset of the limitations\nperiod for recovery of remedial action costs under CERCLA,” no action\ncan be “remedial” until adoption of a final remedial action plan); Hanford\nDownwinders Coalition, Inc. v. Dowdle, 71 F.3d 1469, 1475, 1477 n.10\n(9th Cir. 1995) (holding that a government health assessment was a “re-\nmoval or remedial action entitled to the protection of [42 U.S.C.]\n§ 9613(h)” without the need to clarify the distinction between the two\ntypes of actions).\n   18\n      The Court explained in Skidmore v. Swift & Co. that “[t]he weight\n[accorded to an administrative] judgment in a particular case will depend\nupon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its rea-\nsoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those\nfactors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.” 323\nU.S. 134, 140 (1944); see also Sunoco, 337 F.3d at 1243 (concluding that\nthe EPA’s characterization of a response action deserves Skidmore defer-\nence).\n\f15556        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\ninterpretation may merit some deference whatever its form.”\nMead, 533 U.S. at 234; see also Wilderness Soc’y v. United\nStates Fish & Wildlife Serv., 353 F.3d 1051, 1059-62 (9th Cir.\n2003) (en banc), amended by 360 F.3d 1374 (2004) (applying\nthis analytical framework to review of an agency’s interpreta-\ntion). Put simply, even if EPA manuals, policy statements,\nand other pronouncements “are beyond the Chevron pale,”\nMead, 533 U.S. at 234, they are not beyond the reach of our\ndeference.\n\n   As elaborated below, the statutory definition of “removal”\nis vague and, consequently, the EPA’s construction of this\nstatutory term warrants our deference. In light of this defer-\nence and the well-documented record of the scope of cleanup\nactivity, we hold that the EPA’s action in Libby is properly\ncharacterized as a removal action. In so holding, we recognize\nthat the emphasis on time-sensitivity both in the EPA’s selec-\ntion of a removal action and in our decision whether the\naction carried out actually was a removal action threatens to\ncollapse the two issues into a single “immediacy” inquiry.\nOur review of the EPA’s decision to conduct a removal action\nis limited to whether the EPA considered the eight factors\nunder 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2). In contrast, although imme-\ndiacy is a paramount consideration when evaluating whether\nthe action indeed was a removal, this second phase of our\ninquiry is not bound by those eight factors. For example, we\nalso consider, among other things, the interplay between a\nremoval and remedial action conducted at a single site and\nwhether the action comports with the examples in 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e).\n\n   Grace contests the denomination of the action as a removal\nby cherry-picking discrete cleanup activities which, standing\nalone, might fall within the ambit of a remedial action. We\nrefrain from slicing and dicing the EPA’s single, cohesive\nremoval action into a myriad of fractured parts. Such atomiza-\ntion would undermine the EPA’s scientific and administrative\nexpertise by requiring us to second-guess whether, for exam-\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15557\nple, the excavation of soil at the local elementary school was\na remedial action because 1000 cubic yards of soil was\nremoved when perhaps removal of less soil or less drastic\nmeasures could have been employed to counteract the imme-\ndiate threat. Instead, we take a more comprehensive view of\nthe administrative record in concluding that the EPA’s\nresponse was a removal action.\n\n    1.   STATUTORY INTERPRETATION: REMOVAL AND\n         REMEDIAL ACTIONS\n\n   [5] The first step under Chevron requires a straightforward\nexercise in statutory interpretation: “If a court, employing tra-\nditional tools of statutory interpretation, ascertains that Con-\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that\nintention is the law and must be given effect.” Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843 n.9.\n\n   We begin with the statutory definitions because “[w]hen a\nstatute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that\ndefinition, even if it varies from that term’s ordinary mean-\ning.” Stenberg v. Carhart, 530 U.S. 914, 942 (2000). It has\nbecome de rigueur to criticize CERCLA as a hastily passed\nstatute that is far from a paragon of legislative clarity. See,\ne.g., Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, 475 U.S. 355, 363 (1986) (com-\nmenting that a provision in CERCLA “is not a model of legis-\nlative draftsmanship”); Carson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 883\n(“Clearly, neither a logician nor a grammarian will find com-\nfort in the world of CERCLA.”). The definitions of removal\nand remedial action exemplify this muddled language. See 42\nU.S.C. § 9601(23) (defining “removal”); id. § 9601(24)\n(defining “remedial action”); id. § 9601(25) (defining “re-\nsponse”); see also supra notes 4, 6 (quoting definitions).\n\n   The definition of “removal” is written in sweeping terms.\nIt begins with the general statement that “removal” means\n“the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances\nfrom the environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23). The definition\n\f15558         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\ngoes on to describe three categories of events that trigger\nremoval: (1) “such actions as may be necessary [sic] taken in\nthe event of the threat of release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment”; (2) “such actions as may be necessary to\nmonitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release\nof hazardous substances”; and a third catch-all category,\n(3) “such other actions as may be necessary to prevent, mini-\nmize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to\nthe environment, which may otherwise result from a release\nor threat of release.” Id.\n\n   Finally, the definition lists a number of specific activities\nthat fall within the definition of “removal”—“alternative\nwater supplies,” “temporary evacuation and housing,” and\n“emergency assistance.” Although at first glance this half of\nthe definition appears to provide concrete guidance by listing\nidentifiable activities such as “security fencing,” this part too\nis left vague by the opening caveat that the term “removal”\n“includes, in addition, without being limited to, security fenc-\ning . . . .” Id. Consequently, “these examples serve only as a\nguide to what activities may appropriately be classified as\n‘removal action.’ ” Hanford Downwinders Coalition, 71 F.3d\nat 1478 n.13.\n\n   The definition of “remedial action” is similarly broad, but\ncan be distinguished from “removal” because it refers to “per-\nmanent” remedies and its list of specific actions is, in large\npart, distinct from the list included under “removal.” (For\nexample, “removal” is focused on temporary and emergency\nactivities.) To begin, the definition states that a “remedial\naction” is an action “consistent with permanent remedy taken\ninstead of or in addition to removal actions.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9601(24). Although the section begins with this clear lan-\nguage, it threatens to collapse into the definition of “removal”\nbecause it includes those actions “taken instead of or in addi-\ntion to removal actions” and is triggered “in the event of a\nrelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the\nenvironment, to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15559\nsubstances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial\ndanger to present or future public health or welfare or the\nenvironment.” Id. Thus, the triggering factors begin to sound\nvirtually similar to the triggering factors for a “removal”\naction. In fact, two of the triggering factors for “removal” are\nalmost identical to the factors for “remedy”:\n\n\n Removal — 42 U.S.C.              Remedy — 42 U.S.C.\n § 9601(23)                       § 9601(24)\n\n “such actions as may be          “those actions consistent\n necessary [sic] taken in the     with permanent remedy\n event of the threat of release   taken in the event of a\n of hazardous substances into     release or threatened release\n the environment”                 of hazardous substances into\n                                  the environment”\n\n “such other actions as may       “those actions consistent\n be necessary to prevent,         with permanent remedy\n minimize, or mitigate dam-       taken to prevent or mini-\n age to the public health or      mize the release of hazard-\n welfare or to the environ-       ous substances so that they\n ment, which may otherwise        do not migrate to cause sub-\n result from a release or         stantial danger to present or\n threat of release”               future public health or wel-\n                                  fare or the environment”\n\n\n   The definition concludes with three lists of specific exam-\nples classified as a remedy, such as “segregation of reactive\nwastes.” The first list details various locations of the release.\nAs with the term “removal,” the definition for the first list\ndiminishes the examples’ guidance with the qualifying lan-\nguage that the term “includes, but is not limited to,” the listed\nexamples. Id. The second list spells out when permanent relo-\ncation of residents, businesses, and community facilities is\n\f15560           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nappropriate. Finally, the third list is a list of actions included\nwithin “remedy,” ranging from offsite storage to disposition\nof hazardous substances.\n\n   Adding to the confusion is the overlap between the two def-\ninitions. See Neville Chem. Co., 358 F.3d at 667 (noting list-\ning of “provision of alternative water supplies” under both\n“remedial action” and “removal”); Geraghty & Miller, 234\nF.3d at 927 (noting overlap). Attempting to untie the Gordian\nknot of these definitions solely based on their plain meanings\nis thus unavailing.19\n\n   In interpreting “removal” and “remedial,” we next follow\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance in taking a comprehensive,\nholistic view of CERCLA because it is a “fundamental canon\nof statutory construction that the words of a statute must be\nread in their context and with a view to their place in the over-\nall statutory scheme.” FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 133 (2000) (quoting Davis v. Mich.\nDep’t of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989)).\n\n   [6] CERCLA makes clear that the EPA has the tools of\nboth removal and remedial actions at its fingertips when there\nis a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance.\nSpecifically, the EPA is authorized “to remove or arrange for\nthe removal of, and provide for remedial action relating to\n   19\n      Other courts have similarly been unable to extract answers from the\nstatute’s plain meaning:\n    [T]hose courts which have attempted to unravel CERCLA’s defi-\n    nitions have found no solace in either the “plain meaning” of the\n    statute or the reams of legislative history. Instead, in an attempt\n    to glean legislative intent, courts seem to resort to a sort of “Pur-\n    kinje phenomenon,” hoping that if they stare at CERCLA long\n    enough, it will burn a coherent afterimage on the brain.\nCP Holdings, Inc. v. Goldberg-Zoino & Assocs., Inc., 769 F. Supp. 432,\n435 (D.N.H. 1991) (footnote omitted) (referring to “[a]n optical illusion\nnamed for Johannes E. Purkinje (1787-1869), whereby the eye retains an\nafterimage of an object in a different color from the original”).\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15561\nsuch hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant at any\ntime . . . , or take any other response measure consistent with\nthe national contingency plan which the [EPA] deems neces-\nsary to protect the public health or welfare or the environ-\nment.” 42 U.S.C. § 9604(a)(1). The statute as a whole,\nhowever, does little to clarify how to categorize a given\nresponse action except to suggest that remedial actions may\nbe “long term.” See, e.g., id. § 9604(a)(2) (indicating that any\nremoval action should contribute to the efficient performance\nof any “long term” remedial actions without further elabora-\ntion).\n\n   Nor does the purpose of the statute provide definitive guid-\nance, though it points towards a liberal reading of “removal”\nin order to effectuate CERCLA’s underlying purpose of “pro-\ntect[ing] and preserv[ing] public health and the environment\nby facilitating the expeditious and efficient cleanup of hazard-\nous waste sites.” Carson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 880 (quot-\ning Pritikin v. Dept of Energy, 254 F.3d 791, 794-95 (9th Cir.\n2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); see\nalso, e.g., Sierra Club v. Seaboard Farms, Inc., 387 F.3d\n1167, 1172 (10th Cir. 2004) (advocating that CERCLA be\ninterpreted liberally so as to accomplish its remedial goals).\nSpecifically, because a removal action can be initiated\npromptly after notification of a threat, a liberal reading pro-\nvides the EPA with greater flexibility to use this tool for the\nprotection of the public health.\n\n   Last, we turn to CERCLA’s legislative history for guid-\nance. See BedRoc Ltd. v. United States, 541 U.S. 176, 187 n.8\n(2004) (noting “longstanding precedents that permit resort to\nlegislative history only when necessary to interpret ambigu-\nous statutory text”). But see Johnson v. United States, 529\nU.S. 694, 723 (2000) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing\nmajority’s reliance on legislative history because “[o]ur obli-\ngation is to go as far in achieving the general congressional\npurpose as the text of the statute fairly prescribes—and no\nfurther”).\n\f15562         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   [7] Unfortunately, legislative history is particularly unhelp-\nful because of the haphazard passage of CERCLA with many\nof the more lucid descriptions of the statute falling under the\noxymoronic category of post-enactment “history.” See, e.g.,\n126 Cong. Rec. S16,428 (daily ed. Dec. 12, 1980), reprinted\nin 1 The Environmental Law Institute, Superfund: A Legisla-\ntive History 87 (Helen Cohn Needham & Mark Menefee eds.,\n1982) (hereinafter “Superfund History”) (post-passage “clari-\nfication” by Sen. Stafford that “the purpose of [CERCLA] and\nthe response plan is to protect the public health and welfare\nin its broadest sense”); see also Alfred R. Light, CERCLA\nLaw and Procedure 12-18 (1991) (describing the “unusual\nback-room congressional compromise process” behind CER-\nCLA); 1 Superfund History, supra, at xiii (“The emergence of\nthis last-minute compromise hampers the ability of research-\ners to draw definitive conclusions from the otherwise exten-\nsive legislative history of CERCLA.”). Considering that no\ncommittee or conference reports address the version of CER-\nCLA that ultimately became law, it is apt to describe the\nsearch for legislative history as “somewhat of a snark hunt.”\nCarson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 885.\n\n   Without the benefit of a definitive committee report or\nother deliberate congressional documents describing the gene-\nsis of the final bill, we are hesitant to rely on legislative his-\ntory for guidance, especially in regard to the nuanced inquiry\nas to which side an action falls on the removal/remedial line.\nSee United States v. Adams, 343 F.3d 1024, 1032 n.8 (9th Cir.\n2003) (warning that subsequent legislative history is a “haz-\nardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier Congress”)\n(quoting United States v. McCoy, 323 F.3d 1114, 1121 (9th\nCir. 2003)).\n\n   What we can take away from the legislative history is the\ndrafters’ overarching concern that aggressive action be taken\nto protect the public health. See, e.g., 126 Cong. Rec. S14,714\n(daily ed. Nov. 19, 1980), reprinted in 1 Superfund History,\nsupra, at 90 (statement of Sen. Mitchell) (“The Surgeon Gen-\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15563\neral of the United States has stated that toxic wastes may be\nthe most serious threat to public health in our country in the\nnext decade. So it is in this spirit of urgency that I cosponsor\nthis substitute [bill] today.”); S. Rep. No. 96-848, at 2 (1980)\n(stating in report for unadopted draft of CERCLA that “the\npotential impact of toxic chemicals on the general public and\nenvironment through unsound hazardous disposal sites and\nother releases of chemicals is tremendous”); see also 55 Fed.\nReg. 8666, 8725 (Mar. 8, 1990) (statement in comments to\n1990 amendments to the National Contingency Plan that\n“Section 121 of CERCLA makes clear, and the legislative his-\ntory confirms, that the overarching mandate of the Superfund\nprogram is to protect human health and the environment from\nthe current and potential threats posed by uncontrolled haz-\nardous waste sites.”). Such statements encourage us to con-\nstrue “removal” liberally to effectuate CERCLA’s remedial\npurpose, but they do not illuminate the removal/remedial dis-\ntinction. Cf. Seaboard Farms, 387 F.3d at 1172 (“[CERCLA]\nmust be interpreted liberally so as to accomplish its remedial\ngoals.”); Kelley v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 17 F.3d\n836, 843 (6th Cir. 1994) (“We conclude that Congress\nintended that the term ‘removal action’ be given a broad inter-\npretation.”).\n\n   [8] In sum, we are unable to discern Congress’s clear intent\nthrough the normal tools of statutory interpretation. The\nmeanings of “removal” and “remedial action” under CER-\nCLA are inescapably vague.\n\n    2.   DEFERENCE TO THE EPA’S CHARACTERIZATION\n\n   Having concluded that Congress did not draw a clear line\nbetween removal and remedial actions, we turn to the second\nstep under Chevron and ask whether, in view of the deference\nowed to the EPA, the Libby cleanup was a removal action as\na matter of law. As noted earlier, the level of deference we\naccord to a given agency interpretation is directed by its form.\n\f15564           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   [9] The administrative posture of CERCLA presents two\ntypes of agency interpretations. One is the National Contin-\ngency Plan, which carries the force of law.20 The second\nrelates to informal agency interpretations, which at a mini-\nmum receive respect and, depending on the interplay of Mead\nand Brand X, may even deserve Chevron deference. Which-\never of these applies, we reach the same result: We hold that\nthe EPA has rationally construed CERCLA and that construc-\ntion deserves our respect. Cf. Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conser-\nvation, 540 U.S. at 485-88 (EPA “rationally construed” Clean\nAir Act in internal guidance memoranda, which construction\ndeserved “respect and approbation” but not Chevron defer-\nence). As interpreted by the EPA, the removal/remedial dis-\ntinction boils down to whether the exigencies of the situation\nwere such that the EPA did not have time to undertake the\nprocedural steps required for a remedial action, and, in\nresponding to such a time-sensitive threat, the EPA sought to\nminimize and stabilize imminent harms to human health and\nthe environment. The EPA did so here.\n\n   The definitions of “removal” and “remedial action” in the\nEPA-promulgated National Contingency Plan merely parrot\nCERCLA’s definitions, aside from a few minor revisions for\nthe National Contingency Plan context. See, e.g., 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.5 (replacing “EPA” for “the President” in definition of\n“remedial action” and noting that, for the purpose of the\nNational Contingency Plan, “remedial” and “removal”\ninclude enforcement activities related thereto). Because these\ndefinitions do nothing to interpret the definitions in CERCLA,\nthey are unhelpful to our inquiry.\n   20\n      40 C.F.R. § 300.2 explains that the President delegated to the EPA\n“the responsibility for the amendment of the [National Contingency\nPlan].” See also id. (“The [National Contingency Plan] is applicable to\nresponse actions taken pursuant to the authorities under CERCLA . . . .”);\nVigil v. Leavitt, 381 F.3d 826, 834 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Congress has given\nEPA general rulemaking authority, which, when exercised, requires our\ndeference in accordance with Chevron.”) (citation omitted).\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15565\n   That being said, other parts of the National Contingency\nPlan offer some guidance. For instance, 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e) sets forth examples of activities that are “as a\ngeneral rule,” appropriate as part of a removal action, but\nnotes that the list “is not exhaustive and is not intended to pre-\nvent the lead agency from taking any other actions deemed\nnecessary under CERCLA.” See also 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23)\n(providing that the scope of removals is not limited to the\nexamples in the statutory definition). The examples include,\namong others, fences or other site control precautions; cap-\nping of contaminated soils to reduce migration; excavation,\nconsolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils; and\nremoval and treatment of hazardous materials where it will\nreduce the likelihood of human exposure. 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e). The bulk of activities carried out in Libby easily\nfall within the scope of the listed examples. For instance, the\nEPA removed hazardous soil from the screening plant,\nrestricted access to contaminated roads, installed a temporary\ncover on a school’s ice skating rink, excavated and backfilled\ncontaminated soil, and removed exposed piles of vermiculite.\n\n   [10] Although “immediacy” is not used in the definition of\n“removal” either in CERCLA or the National Contingency\nPlan, the examples in 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(e) imply a level of\nurgency in addressing the threat both by expressly using the\nword “immediately,” see id. § 300.415(e)(9) (providing alter-\nnative water supply “where necessary immediately to reduce\nexposure to contaminated household water”), and by describ-\ning looming threats against which prompt action is needed,\nsee, e.g., id. § 300.415(e)(4) (capping contaminated soils\n“where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances\n. . . into soil, ground or surface water, or air”). Not surpris-\ningly, the criteria used to determine whether the selection of\na removal action is appropriate are similarly infused with this\nsense of immediacy. See, e.g., id. § 300.415(b)(2)(iv) (factors\ninclude whether there are hazardous substances in soils\n“largely at or near the surface, that may migrate”).\n\f15566           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   The need for immediate action permeates the EPA’s activi-\nties in Libby. The toxicologist’s May 17, 2000, report that\nwas attached to the First Action Memo concludes that\n“[a]irborne fiber concentrations in the residential area of\nLibby exceeded the present occupational Permissible Expo-\nsure Level (PEL) of 0.1 fiber/cubic centimeter established by\nOSHA 1994 (MRI, 1982).”21 These levels translated into an\nimmediate public health threat because, as documented in the\nhealth consultation by the Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry, complete exposure pathways were present\naround Libby. For example, EPA investigations found deteri-\norating bags of vermiculite at the former screening plant, as\nwell as vermiculite tailings at the surface of a walking path\nnext to the Libby High School track. And the dilapidated con-\ndition of houses was such that “[i]n some Libby homes, ver-\nmiculite insulation is literally falling out into the living space\nfrom gaps around light fixtures and electrical switches.” That\nthese particles were present in people’s homes and schools is\nespecially troubling because, in contrast to standards set by\nOSHA for workers who are exposed to particles during an\neight-hour workday, home and school contamination could\nresult in exposure for twenty-four hours per day. In short, the\ncarcinogenic fibers were widespread and, contrary to Grace’s\nassertions, were not contained such that they would not be\ninhaled. As ominously observed by the EPA, “Of course once\nairborne, the fibers will migrate whichever way the wind\nblows.”\n\n   The sequence of activities in Libby further comports with\nthe EPA’s description in the National Contingency Plan of the\npreferred development of response actions. The National Con-\ntingency Plan provides that the agency should orderly transi-\n  21\n    The Permissible Exposure Level is for eight hours, not twenty-four.\nAlthough Grace argues that the EPA’s toxicologist’s report is incorrect, it\ndoes not cite to the report of any other experts who concluded otherwise.\nNor does Grace cite to any provisions of OSHA that require a different\nprotocol for the taking of samples which the EPA’s expert did not follow.\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                    15567\ntion from a removal to a remedial action if it “determines that\nthe removal action will not fully address the threat posed by\nthe release.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(g). This progression is evi-\ndenced by the three Action Memos for Libby, which began by\ncalling for a removal action but later paved the way for a\nremedial action.22 Indeed, the First Action Memo notes that\nthe proposed removal action “should compliment and contrib-\nute to the overall success of any remedial actions in the\nfuture.” The Third Action Memo further states, “Continued\nresponse actions are appropriate and consistent with the reme-\ndial actions to be taken.” Thus, the EPA conducted its\nremoval action in Libby not in lieu of a remedial action, but\nrather as a prelude to a comprehensive remedial action.\n\n   Looking beyond the National Contingency Plan, the EPA’s\ncharacterization of response actions in documents that do not\nhave the heft of regulations still carry weight because\n“[c]ogent ‘administrative interpretations . . . not [the] products\nof formal rulemaking . . . nevertheless warrant respect.’ ”\nAlaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation, 540 U.S. at 488 (quoting\nWash. State Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs. v. Guardianship\nEstate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 385 (2003) (alterations in\noriginal)); see also FTC v. Garvey, 383 F.3d 891, 903 (9th\nCir. 2004) (where Chevron deference does not apply, “[an\nagency’s] pronouncement’s persuasiveness may nevertheless\nentitle it to respect”). The need for agency expertise is partic-\nularly acute when we are faced with a complex regulatory\nregime, such as CERCLA. In this situation, we recognize that\nthe “well-reasoned views of an expert administrator rest on a\nbody of experience and informed judgment to which courts\nand litigants may properly resort for guidance.” Alaska Dep’t\nof Envtl. Conservation, 540 U.S. at 487 (internal citations and\nquotation marks omitted).\n  22\n     We note, however, that there need not be a linear progression from a\nremoval to a remedial action. For example, “removal actions may be con-\nducted in response to a time-critical situation at a remedial response site.”\n53 Fed. Reg. 51,394, 51,405 (Dec. 21, 1988) (comment in the EPA’s pro-\nposed revisions to the National Contingency Plan).\n\f15568           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   Most notably, the EPA issued a memo in 2000 to guide\nproject managers during the decisionmaking process of select-\ning between remedial and removal actions. See Stephen Luf-\ntig, Director, Office of Emergency and Remedial Response,\nUse of Non-Time-Critical Removal Authority in Superfund\nResponse Actions (Feb. 14, 2000), available at http://\nwww.epa.gov/superfund/resources/remedy/pdf/memofeb\n2000-s.pdf (last visited July 26, 2005) (hereinafter “Removal\nMemo”). Amplifying the National Contingency Plan’s focus\non the immediacy of the threat, the Removal Memo empha-\nsizes “time sensitivity,” i.e., “the need to take relatively\nprompt action,” as a key characteristic of removal actions:\n“[E]ven expensive and complex response actions may be\nremoval action candidates if they are relatively time-\nsensitive.” Removal Memo, supra, at 3-4 (“For example,\ndredging large quantities of contaminated sediment could be\nconducted using removal authority where such action was the\nappropriate course for abating or controlling a time-sensitive\nthreat.”).23 An EPA report published in 2000 describing the\nremoval program reiterates that “[t]he critical element in\nall cases is time—prompt action is crucial.” Office of Emer-\ngency and Remedial Response, EPA, EPA 540-K-00-002,\nThe Emergency Response and Removal Program 3 (2000),\navailable at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/resources/emer_\nres.htm (last visited July 26, 2005) (hereinafter “Removal\nProgram Report”).\n\n   Courts have also stressed the immediacy of a threat in\n  23\n    The three Action Memos all categorize the action in Libby as “Time\nCritical.” The EPA may also choose to conduct “non-time-critical”\nremoval actions “when the lead Agency determines, based on the site eval-\nuation, that a removal action is appropriate, and a planning period of at\nleast six months is available before on-site activities must begin.” Office\nof Emergency and Remedial Response, EPA, Conducting Non-Time-\nCritical Removal Actions Under CERCLA, EPA/540/F-94/009, at 1(Dec.\n1993), available at http://www.epa.gov/superfund/resources/remedy/pdf/\n540f-94009-s.pdf (last visited July 26, 2005). This subset of removal\nactions is subject to more stringent procedural requirements.\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15569\ndeciding whether a cleanup is a removal action. See, e.g., City\nof Wichita v. Trs. of APCO Oil Corp. Liquidating Trust, 306\nF. Supp. 2d 1040, 1077-78 (D. Kan. 2003) (city’s cleanup was\n“remedial in nature” under CERCLA where “[t]he court has\nheard no evidence that the contamination at the Site posed a\nthreat to human health or the environment which required an\nimmediate response”); Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal\nCorp., 287 F. Supp. 2d 1118, 1157 (C.D. Cal. 2003) (finding\naction was remedial where “[t]here is no evidence in the\nrecord that the materials posed the type of threat to human\nhealth and welfare that required immediate action”); Hatco\nCorp. v. W.R. Grace & Co.-Conn., 849 F. Supp. 931, 963\n(D.N.J. 1994) (in finding response was a removal, placing\n“significant weight upon the fact that the release of [the haz-\nardous substance] was not only imminent, but actually occur-\nring”).\n\n   While stressing time sensitivity, the Removal Memo down-\nplays the importance that some courts have placed on dura-\ntion, i.e., “how long the response action will take to build or\nimplement,” because “removal actions are most often of short\nduration, but they certainly can be long-running responses,\ntoo, thereby undercutting the probative value of duration . . .\nin deciding whether an action is removal rather than remedial\nin nature.” Removal Memo, supra, at 3 n.2. But see Sherwin-\nWilliams Co. v. City of Hamtramck, 840 F. Supp. 470, 475-76\n(E.D. Mich. 1993) (“[T]he extended and protracted nature of\nthe cleanup indicate that the City has engaged in a remedial\naction.”). Accordingly, the action in Libby is not disqualified\nfrom being a removal action just because it took several years.\nCf. Vill. of Milford v. K-H Holding Corp., 390 F.3d 926, 934\n(6th Cir. 2004) (explaining that the court has “never held” that\nthe short-term nature of an action is required for finding costs\nrecoverable as removal costs). The length of the cleanup in\nLibby is especially understandable given that harsh winters\ntruncated the construction season and that the sheer magni-\ntude of the initial cleanup far exceeded the normal situation\nfaced by the EPA. Cf. Sunoco, 337 F.3d at 1244 (concluding\n\f15570         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthat action was a removal in part because it was finished in\nabout 14 months, “a relatively short time frame in the context\nof a clean-up lasting more than a decade in a harsh environ-\nment” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   Likewise, the Removal Memo describes courts’ reliance on\nthe “permanence” of the response as “sometimes misleading”:\n“As a practical matter, removal actions are often permanent\nsolutions such as can be the case in a typical soil or drum\nremoval.” Removal Memo, supra, at 3 n.3; cf. Geraghty &\nMiller, 234 F.3d at 927 (“Even if the replacements for these\nwells are integral to the long-term remediation of the site, that\ndoes not mean that their initial placement cannot be catego-\nrized as removal.”). This observation seems logical, as we do\nnot want to tie the EPA’s hands or compel it to adopt short-\nterm remedies for fear that any more permanent solutions\nautomatically will be dubbed “remedial actions.” Nor would\nit make economic or practical sense to impose a requirement\nthat removal actions must be only temporary in nature. The\nRemoval Memo instead uses the term “comprehensiveness”\nto distinguish between the use of removal authority to conduct\ninterim or partial response actions that are focused on imme-\ndiate risk reduction as compared with a final or “comprehen-\nsive” response at the site. Removal Memo, supra, at 3 n.3.\nThe Libby cleanup exhibits this two-tier approach of an\ninterim removal action that the EPA transforms into a com-\nprehensive remedial action. Cf. Geraghty & Miller, 234 F.3d\nat 926 (noting that “removal actions generally are immediate\nor interim responses”).\n\n   These informal interpretations combined with the descrip-\ntions in the National Contingency Plan provide a persuasive\ninterpretation that removal actions encompass interim, partial\ntime-sensitive responses taken to counter serious threats to\npublic health. As the EPA explained in the Second Action\nMemo, “CERCLA was designed and enacted to prevent ill-\nness and death resulting from exposure to hazardous sub-\nstances, not wait for its occurrence to prove a threat.”\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.           15571\n   Grace attempts to add another layer of complexity to our\nanalysis by challenging various scientific and other methodol-\nogy judgments made by the EPA as part of the cleanup. Once\nwe determine that a response action on the whole is, by\nnature, classified as a removal action under the law, we will\nnot delve further to second-guess the underlying data absent\na showing of specific evidence that the EPA’s conclusions\nwere not warranted. See Balt. Gas and Elec. Co. v. Natural\nRes. Def. Council, 462 U.S. 87, 103 (1983). (“When examin-\ning this kind of scientific determination, as opposed to simple\nfindings of fact, a reviewing court must generally be at its\nmost deferential.”). Although Grace argues in its briefs that\nthe EPA’s data and conclusions were wrong, it did not present\nevidence to support its claim that the EPA’s selection of a\nremoval action was arbitrary and capricious, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9613(j)(2), or that its characterization of the action as a\nremoval action did not comport with the statutory definition,\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23). Of course, the EPA does not have\nfree rein to ignore accepted scientific principle or to adopt\nfindings that are wholly at odds with the record evidence. See\nGreat Basin Mine Watch v. United States EPA, 401 F.3d\n1094, 1098 (9th Cir. 2005) (court will overturn a final agency\naction if the agency “entirely failed to consider an important\naspect of the problem, offered an explanation for its decision\nthat runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or is so\nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in\nview or the product of agency expertise”) (quoting Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463\nU.S. 29, 43 (1983)). But such is not the case here. Nor can it\nbe said that the EPA’s conclusions are arbitrary and capri-\ncious. See Envtl. Def. Ctr., Inc. v. EPA, 344 F.3d 832, 858\nn.36 (9th Cir. 2003) (an agency decision is arbitrary and\ncapricious if there is no rational connection between the deci-\nsion and the facts in the record).\n\n  The disputes between Grace and the EPA regarding testing\nmethodology and data analysis are exceedingly complex. The\nadministrative record includes, for instance, the EPA’s\n\f15572         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nresponse to Grace’s contention that the EPA “inappropriately\ncalculated PCMEs [phase contrast microscopy equivalents] if\nthose findings are going to be compared to the OSHA PEL\n[Occupational Safety & Health Administration permissible\nexposure limits].” We are not scientists, nor do we intend to\nplay armchair EPA administrator. But we are judges and it is\nour role to evaluate the record evidence against the standard\nof review. We defer to the EPA’s reasoned judgment. See\nSunoco, 337 F.3d at 1243 (“[Skidmore] deference seems par-\nticularly appropriate where an action reasonably can be classi-\nfied as both ‘removal’ and ‘remedial’ under CERCLA’s\ncomplex definitional provisions.”).\n\n   The EPA’s scientific basis for finding an immediate threat\nto the public health is thoroughly documented over thousands\nof pages. In addition to the detailed evaluation of the threat in\nthe three Action Memos, the administrative record includes,\nfor example, comprehensive reports by both the EPA’s\nregional toxicologist and senior toxicologist explaining the\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health in\nLibby, extensive responses by the EPA to Grace’s comments\non the cleanup, and lengthy findings by the Agency for Toxic\nSubstances and Disease Registry on medical testing con-\nducted on Libby residents. In particular, the Agency’s Febru-\nary 22, 2001, report documents findings from its study\nconducted from July through November 2000 in which 1,078\npeople participated. Of those participants, the findings can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                   15573\n\n\n Type of Possible Exposure             Percentage who had a pleu-\n                                       ral abnormality24 on the\n                                       chest radiograph that could\n                                       be seen by at least two certi-\n                                       fied specialists\n\n Grace Workers and second-                   37%\n ary contractors\n\n Other work-related contacts                 18%\n with vermiculite\n\n Household contacts           with           20%\n Grace Workers\n\n Vermiculite      insulation     in          14%\n home\n\n Some recreational contact                   16%\n with vermiculite\n\n No apparent exposure, but                   14%\n lives in or around Libby\n\n\nIn comparison, the report recites the following statistics:\n  24\n    According to the report, “Asbestos exposure is associated with several\nchanges in the pleura (lining of the lungs and internal chest wall). . . .\nThey indicate past exposure to asbestos, and can often be detected in chest\nradiographs (CXW), also known as X-rays.” The report goes on to explain\nthat “[t]he presence of any of these pleural abnormalities on chest radio-\ngraph, associated with asbestos exposure, indicates increased risk for\nmesothelioma and lung cancer.”\n\f15574         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n    Studies of differing groups within the United States\n    believed to have no substantive work-related asbes-\n    tos exposures have found the prevalence of pleural\n    abnormalities ranging from 0.02% among blue-collar\n    workers in North Carolina [Castellan 1985], to 0.9%\n    among loggers in Washington and Oregon [Stilbolt\n    1991], to 1.8% among New Jersey residents [Ander-\n    son 1979], and 2.3% among patients at Veterans\n    Administration hospitals in New Jersey [Miller JA\n    1996].\n\n   Further, in response to the EPA’s request that the Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry comment on\nwhether the proposed removal action was appropriate to pro-\ntect the public health, the Agency concluded in a May 17,\n2000, report that “Asbestos contamination is present at the\nscreening plant and export plant at levels that pose a public\nhealth hazard. The time critical removal action proposed by\nEPA is warranted to protect the public health.”\n\n   Beyond the findings that prompted the EPA to undertake\nthe removal action, the administrative record also documents\nthe concrete steps taken to combat this threat, such as remov-\ning vermiculite tailings from under and around running tracks\nat local schools, covering and demarcating major contami-\nnated areas at residential properties, and cleaning the interiors\nof infected homes.\n\n   [11] In sum, given the sweeping language in the definition\nof “removal,” the significant deference due to the EPA’s\ninterpretation of this language, and the scope of the interim\ncleanup, we hold that the EPA’s cleanup in Libby falls within\nthe bounds of a removal action. The EPA “has rationally con-\nstrued the Act’s text and [the] EPA’s construction warrants\nour respect and approbation.” Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conser-\nvation, 540 U.S. at 485. This holding comports with CER-\nCLA’s fundamental goal of protecting the public health. See,\ne.g., Hanford Downwinders Coalition, 71 F.3d at 1481\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15575\n(“[T]his circuit has joined others in recognizing that protec-\ntion of the public health was one of the remedial goals of\nCERCLA.”). Considering the chaotic history behind CER-\nCLA’s passage, we are particularly sensitive not to adopt a\nreading that would undermine its remedial purpose. See Clark\nv. Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, 332 U.S. 480, 488 (1947)\n(advising that courts should not adopt an interpretation of stat-\nutory language that would “run counter to the policy of the\nAct and be disruptive of its purpose . . . [when] dealing with\nhasty legislation which Congress did not stop to perfect as an\nintegrated whole”).\n\n   [12] In so holding, we recognize that Congress created a\nbifurcated scheme of removal and remedial actions and,\naccordingly, there must be outer limits to removal actions.\nBut the EPA did not exceed these limits in this case. Nor need\nwe delineate the outer parameters. We simply conclude that\nthe EPA’s characterization of the cleanup in Libby as a\nremoval action is amply supported by the administrative\nrecord and easily withstands scrutiny under the modified level\nof interpretive deference afforded by Mead and Alaska\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. Although defer-\nence to the EPA’s interpretation is significant, it is not blind.\nCourts must, as a matter of law, ultimately determine that the\nEPA’s characterization of a given response action accords\nwith CERCLA, as we so determine here.\n\n   [13] Crucial to our determination is the documented evi-\ndence that, absent immediate attention, the airborne toxic par-\nticles would continue to pose a substantial threat to public\nhealth. To combat this widespread, looming threat, the EPA\nhad no choice but to undertake an aggressive removal action\nof an expansive scope. The removal activities easily fall\nwithin the statutory definition of removal. Notably, the defini-\ntions for removal and remedial actions consciously include\nsome overlap. Because of the nature of the contaminant, some\nof the measures taken by the EPA as part of the removal\naction might also effect a permanent solution for a particular\n\f15576          UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nlocation (e.g., removing exposed piles of vermiculite). But by\nno means did the removal action fully eliminate the public\nhealth threat or amount to a full-blown remediation. Accord-\ning to the EPA’s CERCLIS database, the EPA is continuing\nwork to ensure that potential or actual human exposures are\nunder control. See http://cfpub1.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/\ncsitinfo.cfm?id=0801744 (last visited July 26, 2005).\nAlthough Libby’s problems appear far from solved, the EPA\nis making progress. As envisioned by CERCLA, the EPA\nplans to effect a comprehensive resolution to the asbestos\ncontamination through the pending remedial action.\n\nII.   EXEMPTIONS FROM THE $2 MILLION, 12-MONTH\n      STATUTORY CAP APPLICABLE TO REMOVAL ACTIONS\n\n   Having determined that the action is properly characterized\nas a removal action, the inquiry turns to whether the EPA can\nrecover costs in excess of the $2 million, 12-month statutory\ncap on removal actions. See 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5). The\ndistrict court found persuasive the EPA’s explanations in the\nAction Memos of the immediate risk to public health. Grace\nI, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1144. We agree and hold that, consider-\ning the widespread and pervasive asbestos contamination and\nthe potential for further migration of asbestos fibers as docu-\nmented in the Action Memos, the EPA’s decision to exceed\nthe statutory cap was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n  [14] We begin with the language of 42 U.S.C. § 9604(c)(1):\n\n      Unless (A) [the EPA] finds that (i) continued\n      response actions are immediately required to pre-\n      vent, limit, or mitigate an emergency, (ii) there is an\n      immediate risk to public health or welfare or the\n      environment, and (iii) such assistance will not other-\n      wise be provided on a timely basis, . . . obligations\n      from the Fund . . . shall not continue after\n      $2,000,000 has been obligated for response actions\n      or 12 months has elapsed from the date of initial\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                 15577\n       response to a release or threatened release of hazard-\n       ous substances.\n\nSee also 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5) (limiting actions to $2\nmillion and 12 months “unless the lead agency determines\nthat” one of the exemptions applies). Despite Grace’s asser-\ntion that the decision to exceed the cap is not subject to arbi-\ntrary and capricious review, the fact that the statute allows the\nEPA to invoke the exemptions when it “finds” certain condi-\ntions counsels otherwise. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (courts should\nset aside agency conclusions and findings where “arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-\ndance with law”). The EPA’s determinations in this case that\nthere was an emergency, that the risk to public health was\nimmediate, and that the assistance would not otherwise be\nforthcoming are inherently fact-based.\n\n  In the First Action Memo, the EPA determined that the\nremoval action met the three statutory elements required to\nexceed the cap. See § 9604(c)(1)(A). Namely, (1) the asbestos\nin the environment posed an immediate threat to the local\npopulation; (2) a cleanup beyond the cap was required to pre-\nvent, limit, or mitigate an emergency25 because of the size of\n  25\n    The term “emergency” is not defined in CERLCA or the National\nContingency Plan, and the EPA has interpreted it to include a range of\ntime-sensitive threats:\n       Not all actions begin under what are commonly thought of as\n       “emergency” conditions. Though events such as tire fires, train\n       derailments, and chemical explosions require immediate action,\n       other less dramatic threats to public health are addressed under\n       EPA’s Emergency Response and Removal Program. Such threats\n       include the discovery of leaking drums or tanks at an abandoned\n       factory or complaints of tainted drinking water near a landfill.\n       Regardless of the circumstances, quick and efficient cleanup of\n       hazardous material eliminates risks to people and the environ-\n       ment and minimizes the stigma contamination can bring to prop-\n       erties and communities.\nRemoval Program Report, supra, at 3.\n\f15578        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthe cleanup and the short construction season; and (3) assis-\ntance from other government agencies was not anticipated on\na timely basis. The Second Action Memo reiterated this reli-\nance on the “emergency exemption,” explaining that “[a]t all\nthe locations discussed in this Action Memorandum if\nRemoval Actions are not initiated or continued then people\nwill be exposed to unsafe levels of amphibole asbestos.” In\nlight of the EPA’s documentation of complete exposure path-\nways and the resulting continuing threat to public health, we\nhold that the EPA “articulate[d] a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the conclusions made.” Envtl. Def. Ctr.,\n344 F.3d at 858 n.36.\n\n   Turning to the Third Action Memo, the EPA continued its\nreliance on the emergency exemption, once again citing the\nstatutory factors and explaining that a continued removal\naction was necessary to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of\nasbestos. In addition, the EPA relied on the “consistency\nexemption,” which allows for a continued removal action\nover the cap when it is “otherwise appropriate and consistent\nwith the remedial action to be taken.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9604(c)(1)(C); see also 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5)(ii) (corre-\nsponding provision). At the time the Third Action Memo was\nreleased, the EPA had proposed Libby to the National Priori-\nties List but it had not yet been listed. Thus, as envisioned in\nthe Action Memos, the removal action in Libby was not an\nexhaustive cleanup effort. Rather, the EPA has segued into\nthe remedial phase and, in the interim, found that “[c]ontinued\nresponse actions are appropriate and consistent with the reme-\ndial actions to be taken.”\n\n   On a practical level, the need to exceed the cap is not sur-\nprising given the urgency, magnitude, and long-standing\nnature of the problem. First, the tremendous scope of the\nremoval in Libby made the $2 million ceiling unworkable. An\nentire town needed to be cleaned up, not just a mobile home\npark, Carson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 867, or a “five-acre\nparcel of land,” Chapman, 146 F.3d at 1168. In contrast to\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15579\nthese localized threats, the EPA explained in its response to\ncomments received from Grace in December 2001 that it still\nhad more than 2000 properties to sample around Libby.\n\n   The 12-month limit was also impractical given both the\nscale of the effort and the meteorological reality of the harsh\nconditions, which result in a short construction season and\nthus necessitate several years to complete cleanup activities\nthat might be completed considerably faster in a more temper-\nate climate. The severe winters and hot summers are further\nproblematic in that they exacerbate the spread of asbestos par-\nticles through wind and erosion. Cleansing the site of these\nwidespread particles requires such labor-intensive acts as bulk\nremoval of contaminated materials followed by thorough\ncleaning and vacuuming of the houses.\n\n   [15] Given these daunting realities and the EPA’s careful\ndocumentation of its reasons for invoking the emergency and\nconsistency exemptions, we hold that the EPA’s decision to\nexceed the statutory cap was based on the relevant factors,\nthere has been no clear error of judgment, and the decision\nwas not arbitrary and capricious. See Marsh v. Or. Nat’l Res.\nCouncil, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989); Envtl. Def. Ctr., 344 F.3d\nat 858 n.36. Therefore, the EPA is entitled to recover the full\ncosts of its removal action in Libby as found by the district\ncourt.\n\nIII.   INDIRECT COSTS CALCULATION\n\n   Finally, Grace complains that the methodology used to cal-\nculate indirect costs of $11,322,226 overstated the EPA’s\ncosts attributable to the Libby response action. See Grace II,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 1173, 1187 (calculating indirect costs).\nGrace disputes the use of total site-specific costs as the basis\nfor calculating indirect costs, arguing that because the EPA\ndelegated substantial authority to the U.S. Department of\nTransportation, the EPA’s overhead was substantially lower\n\f15580         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthan it would have been had the EPA administered the entire\nproject directly.\n\n   After review of the district court’s extensive findings on the\nindirect costs methodology and its application to this particu-\nlar case, see id. at 1167-73, we conclude that the district court\ndid not err in its award of indirect costs. See W. Props. Serv.\nCorp. v. Shell Oil Co., 358 F.3d 678, 685 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(“The district court’s findings of fact can be reversed only if\nclearly erroneous, and not merely because we might have\nfound otherwise on the same evidence.”).\n\n   [16] CERCLA authorizes the EPA to recover “all costs of\nremoval or remedial action . . . [that are] not inconsistent with\nthe national contingency plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A).\n“All costs” include indirect costs such as administrative and\nother overhead costs incurred in managing the greater Super-\nfund program. See, e.g., United States v. Dico, 266 F.3d 864,\n878 (8th Cir. 2001) (concluding that “oversight and indirect\ncosts are recoverable in remedial actions under CERCLA”).\nIn order to capture these costs from disparate CERCLA\nresponse actions, “Allocating indirect costs that cannot be\ndirectly accounted for as costs of a specific project is a well-\nestablished accounting practice.” Kennecott Utah Copper\nCorp. v. United States DOI, 88 F.3d 1191, 1224 (D.C. Cir.\n1996).\n\n   Grace maintains that the EPA should have used the “labor\nhour” approach that the EPA abandoned in 2000. Under the\nlabor hour method, the indirect costs attributable to each site\nwere calculated based on the number of hours that EPA per-\nsonnel charged to a site during a fiscal year. Cf. United States\nv. R.W. Meyer, Inc., 889 F.2d 1497, 1503-04 (6th Cir. 1989)\n(calculating indirect costs using labor hours method). In con-\ntrast, the new “full cost” methodology allocates indirect costs\nbased on the total site-specific expenditures incurred for a\nparticular site.\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15581\n   The EPA explains that the labor hours method was rejected\nbecause it did not identify the full costs of Superfund site\ncleanups, and the revised methodology is a better process for\nestimating and allocating the total Superfund overhead costs.\nThe revised methodology is also supported by reports from\nthe General Accounting Office and the accounting firm\nKPMG, which found that the full cost approach complies with\nthe federal government’s costs accounting standards. See\nGrace II, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1171-72; see also Guidance on\nExercising CERCLA Enforcement Discretion in Anticipation\nof Full Cost Accounting Consistent With the “Statement of\nFederal Financial Accounting Standards No. 4,” 65 Fed. Reg.\n35, 339 (EPA June 2, 2000).\n\n   [17] In awarding the EPA $11.32 million in indirect costs,\nthe district court found that the “EPA’s revised methodology\nis an appropriate accounting measure of its indirect costs\ncharged to Superfund sites, including the Libby Asbestos\nSite.” Grace II, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1169. The district court\nreached this conclusion after a three-day trial and detailed\nfindings. Grace characterizes this conclusion as a legal error\nmeriting de novo review. We disagree. The district court’s\napproach comports with the statute; the court’s findings on\nthe methodology and its application to this case are supported\nby the record, id. at 1167-73, and we will not overturn them\nexcept for clear error. See W. Props. Serv. Corp., 358 F.3d at\n685. Besides, we do not think it is in anyone’s interest to have\nappellate courts step into the accountants’ shoes and deter-\nmine the accuracy of accounting calculations de novo.\nGrace’s arguments do not rise to the level of demonstrating\nthat the district court’s findings were clearly erroneous. We\nare particularly hesitant to second-guess the district court’s\njudgment on this issue where the court specifically found that\nGrace’s accounting expert was “not credible.” Grace II, 280\nF. Supp. 2d at 1169, 1171 (“[Grace’s] accounting expert . . .\ndoes not know what methodology the EPA should use to\nrecover its indirect costs.”).\n\f15582        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n                         CONCLUSION\n\n   We AFFIRM the district court’s order granting the EPA\nsummary judgment on the liability issue. We also AFFIRM\nthe district court’s order awarding the EPA $54,527,081.11 in\ncosts and a declaratory judgment on the liability of Grace for\nfuture costs.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n   I concur in the result that the majority reaches. The EPA’s\nactivities in Libby, Montana, when taken as a whole, are\nproperly classified as a removal action in response to the\nimmediate threat posed by the large quantities of friable\nasbestos found in Libby. See, e.g., Majority Opinion at\np.15576 ante (noting that EPA toxicologist reported that\nLibby residents were being exposed to airborne asbestos in\nexcess of OSHA’s permissible occupational exposure level).\nAccordingly, I would uphold the EPA’s classification of its\nLibby response action under Mead as opposed to Chevron\ndeference. See United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218,\n234-35 (2001).\n\n   Under CERCLA, the EPA can recover “all costs of removal\nor remedial action . . . not inconsistent with the national con-\ntingency plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A). The regulations\nset forth the national contingency plan standards governing\nthe EPA’s selection of a response action. See 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415. In conducting judicial review, this court “shall\nuphold the President’s decision in selecting the response\naction unless the objecting party can demonstrate, on the\nadministrative record, that the decision was arbitrary and\ncapricious or otherwise not in accordance with the law.” 42\nU.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15583\n   The national contingency plan regulations governing\nremoval action also provide that “[i]n determining the appro-\npriate extent of action to be taken in response to a given\nrelease, the lead agency shall first review the removal site\nevaluation, any information produced through a remedial site\nevaluation . . . and the current site conditions, to determine if\nremoval action is appropriate.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(a)(1).\nThus, the regulations govern not only the EPA’s selection of\na response action, but also its determination of the extent of\na response action. Id. at 300.415(a)(1). I would also review\nthis latter determination under the arbitrary and capricious\nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\n\n   For example, the EPA’s decision to excavate the vermicu-\nlite tailings buried beneath the Libby Middle School track\nwarrants scrutiny. According to a letter from the superinten-\ndent of Libby’s schools, the EPA had concluded that “[s]ince\nthe asbestos . . . detected is all at depth and, in some cases,\ncovered by the track,” “there is not currently a risk of expo-\nsure.” Were this the only finding in the record, I would be\nhard pressed to see any rational connection between this find-\ning and the decision to include the Middle School track in the\nEPA’s removal action.\n\n   However, the record contains additional findings that sup-\nply a rational reason for removing the track.

Grace & Co.-Conn. (collectively,\n“Grace”) do not dispute that they are financially obligated\nunder CERCLA to assist with the cleanup of asbestos origi-\nnating from their former mining and processing operations\nnear Libby.2 Instead, Grace contests the EPA’s characteriza-\ntion of the cleanup as a removal action rather than a remedial\naction under CERCLA. If the cleanup is a remedial action,\nwhich is often characterized as a permanent cleanup, then\nGrace argues that the EPA did not fulfill the regulatory\nrequirements for remedial actions. For example, a remedial\naction requires certain analysis of the costs and effectiveness\nof the remediation and also requires inclusion on the National\nPriority List. See 40 C.F.R. §§ 300.425(b)(1), 300.430(e)(7).\nIn contrast, the regulatory requirements for removal actions,\nwhich provide the EPA with substantial flexibility to tailor\nprompt and effective responses to immediate threats to human\nhealth and the environment, are considerably relaxed.\n\n   Grace argues that the EPA circumvented the regulatory\nsafeguards by conducting a remedial action under the guise of\na removal, thereby giving the EPA free rein to conduct what\nGrace styles as “the quintessential remedial action” under the\nless-restrictive requirements applied to removals. Grace pre-\nsents this as a legal question: Is the EPA’s characterization of\nits activities in Libby as a removal action correct as a matter\nof law?\n\n   Grace further contends that even if the action is appropri-\nately classified as a removal action, the district court erred in\nexempting the action from CERCLA’s general 12-month, $2\nmillion cap for removal actions and in granting the EPA over\n$54 million in reimbursement plus a declaratory judgment for\n  2\n   In February 2005, the United States unsealed a criminal indictment\ncharging Grace and various of its employees with offenses relating to\nknowingly exposing miners and Libby residents to asbestos.

Finally, Grace disputes the accounting methods\nused to calculate the EPA’s indirect costs.\n\n   The situation confronting the EPA in Libby is truly extraor-\ndinary. This cleanup site is not a remote, abandoned mine.\nRather, the population of Libby and nearby communities,\nwhich the EPA estimates at about 12,000, faces ongoing, per-\nvasive exposure to asbestos particles being released through\ndocumented exposure pathways. We cannot escape the fact\nthat people are sick and dying as a result of this continuing\nexposure. Confronted with this information, the EPA deter-\nmined on the basis of its professional judgment, and in accord\nwith its administrative interpretation of the scope of removal\nactions, that the situation warranted an immediate, aggressive\nresponse to abate the public health threat.\n\n   Although we diverge from the district court’s reasoning in\nsome respects, we reach the same ultimate conclusion: The\nEPA’s cleanup in Libby was a removal action that was\nexempt from the temporal and monetary cap. In light of the\nEPA’s expertise in this area, we owe considerable deference,\nalbeit not necessarily full Chevron deference, to its character-\nization of the cleanup activities as a removal action.

We therefore affirm the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\n                         BACKGROUND\n\n   The outcome of this case is controlled by our interpretation\nof key provisions of CERCLA, a comprehensive statutory\nscheme to respond to environmental threats, obtain compensa-\ntion from those responsible for the polluting activities, and\nassign liability to responsible parties. See Pub. L. No. 96-510,\n94 Stat. 2767 (1980). Before applying CERCLA to the case\nat hand, we begin with a brief review of this statute as well\nas the background on the hazards afflicting Libby.\n\f15538            UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nI.   CERCLA\n\n   A key component of CERCLA was the establishment of a\ntrust fund, commonly known as “Superfund,” for use when\nresponding to the release or threat of release of hazardous\nsubstances into the environment. See CERCLA, Subtitle B–\nEstablishment of Hazardous Substance Response Trust Fund\n§ 221, 94 Stat. at 2801-02; see also Superfund Amendments\nand Reauthorization Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-499, 100\nStat. 1613 (1986). Today, Superfund expenditures are directed\nby the provisions of CERCLA and the National Oil and Haz-\nardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (“National\nContingency Plan”), 40 C.F.R. pt. 300.3\n\n   CERCLA and the National Contingency Plan divide\nresponse actions into two broad categories: removal actions\nand remedial actions. See 42 U.S.C. § 9601(25).

In light of the central importance of the defini-\ntion to this case, it is worth citing the rather cumbersome definition in its\nentirety:\n     The terms “remove” or “removal” means the cleanup or removal\n     of released hazardous substances from the environment, such\n     actions as may be necessary [sic] taken in the event of the threat\n     of release of hazardous substances into the environment, such\n     actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the\n     release or threat of release of hazardous substances, the disposal\n     of removed material, or the taking of such other actions as may\n     be necessary to prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the\n     public health or welfare or to the environment, which may other-\n     wise result from a release or threat of release.

HISTORY OF THE EPA’S CLEANUP ACTIVITIES IN LIBBY\n\n  The roots of this case stretch back nearly a century to the\nbeginning of mining operations in the vicinity of Libby. It\nwas not until the late 1990s, however, that the extent of the\nproblem came to light fully, leading to the EPA’s cleanup\naction.\n\n  A.    ASBESTOS CONTAMINATION IN LIBBY\n\n   From the 1920s until 1990, Grace and its predecessors\nmined and processed vermiculite—a mineral containing a\ntype of asbestos called tremolite—at a mine approximately\nseven miles northeast of Libby. See Grace I at 1138-41\n(describing factual background in an order granting the EPA’s\nmotion for summary judgment). Processed ore was trucked to\nscreening plants and expansion/export plants from which the\n  7\n   The National Priorities List is “the list, compiled by EPA pursuant to\nCERCLA section 105, of uncontrolled hazardous substance releases in the\nUnited States that are priorities for long-term remedial evaluation and\nresponse.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.5.\n\f15542        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nmaterials were distributed nationwide. Vermiculite was also\navailable for employees to take home for their personal use,\nand Grace donated vermiculite to the local schools.\n\n   Although Grace did not cease mining and processing opera-\ntions in Libby until 1990, state and federal agencies con-\nducted studies on the health effects of the mining operations\nas early as the 1940s. These efforts were, however, focused\non workplace exposure rather than contamination in the\ngreater Libby community. For example, in the 1940s and\n1950s, the Montana State Board of Health issued several\nindustrial hygiene studies to determine whether the mine’s\noperations were detrimental to the employees’ health. In\n1992, the EPA issued a written determination on the applica-\nbility of the National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air\nPollutants to a road on the mine property. However, no CER-\nCLA activities were performed in Libby prior to the EPA’s\ncommencement of an investigation in 1999 that led to the cur-\nrent cleanup.\n\n  B.    THE EPA’S INVOLVEMENT IN LIBBY\n\n   After beginning its investigation in November 1999, the\nEPA issued a Sampling and Quality Assurance Project Plan\nin December, followed by a more comprehensive revised plan\nin January 2000. The plan “address[ed] questions and con-\ncerns raised by citizens of Libby regarding possible ongoing\nexposures to asbestos fibers as a result of historical mining,\nprocessing and exportation of asbestos-containing vermicu-\nlite.” The EPA’s immediate efforts were directed toward (1)\nobtaining information on airborne asbestos levels in order to\njudge whether a time-critical intervention was needed to pro-\ntect public health, and (2) obtaining data on friable asbestos\nlevels in potentially contaminated materials around Libby.\nThe EPA stated that “[t]he first decision to be made is\nwhether or not time-critical intervention is needed to protect\npublic health.”\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.           15543\n   In his testimony before the Senate’s Environment and Pub-\nlic Works Committee in February 2000, the EPA’s regional\nadministrator attested that the initial investigation confirmed\ntwo things: (1) “a large number of current and historic cases\nof asbestos related diseases centered around Libby,” including\n“33 incidents of apparently non-occupational exposures”; and\n(2) a “high likelihood that significant amounts of asbestos\ncontaminated vermiculite still remain in and around Libby.”\nVermiculite from the mine’s waste piles was “commonly used\nby local residents in their yards and gardens as a soil condi-\ntioner.” It was also used to create running tracks and baseball\nfields for nearby schools. The residents were particularly con-\ncerned because children regularly played in and around piles\nof vermiculite. These findings compelled the EPA to under-\ntake more expansive testing. To put it mildly, subsequent test-\ning showed asbestos contamination to be pervasive.\n\n   Because asbestos is generally only harmful if inhaled or\ningested, the mere presence of asbestos does not necessarily\nconstitute an immediate threat. But the situation in Libby did\nnot present this benign scenario. Instead, the EPA docu-\nmented “complete human exposure pathways” through which\nasbestos particles were becoming airborne as a result of nor-\nmal human activities, such as foot traffic and vacuuming, and\nnatural forces, such as wind—especially during the dry sum-\nmer months. This migration transformed the latent threat of\nundisturbed asbestos into a current hazard to anyone breathing\nthe airborne particles. For example, residents described halt-\ning baseball games when large dust clouds swept over the\nfield carrying particles from exposed piles of vermiculite. A\nstudy of Libby residents conducted in 2000 by the Agency for\nToxic Substances and Disease Registry not only found that\nmost participants reported multiple routes of exposure, but\nalso that 18% of those x-rayed had abnormalities in the lining\nof their lungs—as compared with the expected rate of 0.2%\nto 2.3% for groups living in the United States who have no\nknown asbestos exposures.\n\f15544           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   These findings led the EPA to set out the intended removal\naction in a series of three memoranda issued between May\n2000 and May 2002, which progressively broadened the\nscope of the cleanup. The original action memorandum, dated\nMay 23, 2000 (“First Action Memo”), covered a former ver-\nmiculite export plant and screening plant, the former of which\nwas being used as a retail lumber mill and the latter as a com-\nbined commercial/residential property.8 The First Action\nMemo authorized a time-critical removal action9 to be com-\npleted by spring/summer 2001 with a total project ceiling of\napproximately $5.8 million for the two sites. The EPA deter-\nmined that the action met the requirements to exceed the $2\nmillion, 12-month cap because the asbestos in the environ-\nment posed an immediate threat to the local population; a\ncleanup beyond the cap was required to prevent, limit, or miti-\ngate an emergency because of the size of the cleanup and the\nshort construction season; and assistance from other govern-\nment agencies was not anticipated on a timely basis.\n\n   The EPA then broadened the scope of the cleanup in an\naction memorandum amendment, dated July 20, 2001\n(“Second Action Memo”), which covered “newly identified\nrisks” at six additional locations and requested increased\nfunding for costs associated with Grace’s reported denial of\n  8\n     Grace largely conducted the cleanup of the export plant in response to\nan EPA order dated May 23, 2000.\n   9\n     The EPA describes the cleanup in Libby as a single removal action\nboth in the action memoranda and its briefs to this court: “EPA authorized\na removal action to remove asbestos-contaminated materials from hun-\ndreds of homes, businesses, yards, gardens, school athletic fields, drive-\nways, and mining plant facilities.” (emphasis added). Likewise, on appeal,\nGrace argues that the district court erred “by granting the United States\nsummary judgment with respect to the validity of EPA’s characterization\nof the Libby response action as a removal rather than a remedial action.”\nAccordingly, we analyze the EPA’s activities in Libby as a single response\naction rather than a patchwork of discrete smaller actions.

For\nexample, the EPA found nuggets of tremolite around the high\nschool track that it described as “readily friable, releasing\ncopious amounts of fibers upon degradation.” The EPA mea-\nsured asbestos concentrations of 2% by polarized light\nmicroscopy (“PLM”) at a pile of vermiculite at one residence,\nand concentrations up to 1.5% in material scraped off equip-\nment at the other residence.10 Samples taken from materials\nvisible outside the elementary school indicated that the area\ncontained asbestos at levels between 3% to 8% by PLM, and\ntesting at the road showed asbestos concentrations up to 5%.\nAs with the First Action Memo, the EPA determined that the\nsituation warranted an exemption from the cap and, conse-\nquently, authorized a total site removal ceiling of approxi-\nmately $20.1 million with an estimated completion date for\nmost of the work by winter 2001/02.\n\n  The EPA expanded the removal action again in an action\nmemorandum amendment, dated May 2, 2002 (“Third Action\nMemo”), which brought a number of homes and businesses in\n  10\n    To put these numbers into perspective, in the First Action Memo, the\nEPA explained how asbestos concentrations in soil translate into risks to\nthe public health:\n       Currently EPA has not established, under any of its regulatory\n       programs, an asbestos level in soil below which an exposure does\n       not pose a risk. The 1% cut-off level for regulation under the\n       Toxic Substances Control Act abatement program was estab-\n       lished on the basis of analytical capability at the time, and was\n       not established based on the level of risk represented. To the con-\n       trary, at Superfund sites in California EPA Region IX found in\n       certain settings that concentrations of asbestos less than 1%\n       posed unacceptable inhalation risks when subject to disturbance\n       by traffic.\nSignificantly, the asbestos was in a friable state.\n\f15546           UNITED STATES v.

In addition, although Libby was not added to the\nNational Priorities List until October 2002, see 67 Fed. Reg.\n65,315 (Oct. 24, 2002), the EPA proposed that the site be\nadded in February 2002. The Third Action Memo also\nexplained that the removal action was consistent with a\nplanned future remedial action.11 The EPA estimated that the\nproposed work would take two to three construction seasons,\nand it raised the total project ceiling to approximately $55.6\nmillion. The EPA continued removal activities consistent with\nits various Action Memos.12\n\n  C.    COST-RECOVERY ACTION AGAINST GRACE\n\n   The EPA filed suit against Grace in March 2001 seeking\nrecovery of all response costs incurred by the government and\na declaration that Grace would be liable for future costs. See\n42 U.S.C. §§ 9607, 9613(g)(2). In December 2002, the district\ncourt granted the EPA summary judgment on the liability\nissue but determined that there were material issues of fact\nregarding costs associated with certain properties. Grace I,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 1148.\n\n   After a three-day bench trial, the district court issued an\norder awarding the EPA the full $54.53 million in reimburse-\nment requested, including $11.32 million in indirect costs,\nand granting a declaratory judgment that Grace would be lia-\nble for future cleanup costs. United States v. W.R. Grace &\n  11\n      The EPA proposed that the Libby site be added to the National Priori-\nties List in February 2002 so that a remedial response action could be con-\nducted.

Reg. 65,315 (Oct. 24, 2002).\n   12\n      According to the EPA’s CERCLIS database, the EPA currently is in\nthe study and remedy selection phase and a final remedy has not been\nselected for the Libby site.

This\nappeal followed.\n\n                               ANALYSIS\n\n   The EPA’s ability to recover the costs of its cleanup in\nLibby hinges on whether its response is properly character-\nized as a removal action, as argued by the EPA and found by\nthe district court, or a remedial action, as argued by Grace.13\nThe tangled language of CERCLA hardly lends itself to clear-\ncut distinctions between the two types of actions. Nonethe-\nless, certain overarching attributes emerge with the time-\nsensitivity of the threat and the significance of the public\nhealth threat as key factors underlying removal actions. In\nLibby, the EPA determined that there was a serious threat to\npublic health that required a time-sensitive response, and it\nacted on this information.\n\n   We emphasize at the outset that the EPA’s response action\nin Libby is no mere run-of-the-mill CERCLA cleanup. As the\nEPA itself recognizes, the Libby cleanup is a unique removal\naction of a size and cost not previously seen. But the situation\nin Libby was, and remains today, truly extraordinary.\n\n\n\n\n  13\n     Under CERCLA’s burden-shifting procedures, once the EPA estab-\nlishes its prima facie case for response costs, the burden shifts to Grace\nto prove that the response was inconsistent with the National Contingency\nPlan. See United States v. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755350\"><a href=\"/opinion/755350/united-states-v-harold-b-chapman-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169 (9th Cir. 1998).\nSpecifically, CERCLA provides that responsible parties shall be liable for\n“all costs of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States\nGovernment . . . not inconsistent with the national contingency plan.” 42\nU.S.C. § 9607(a)(4). Because the National Contingency Plan prescribes\nheightened requirements for a remedial action, a threshold inquiry is\nwhether the action was a removal or remedial action. The EPA does not\ndispute that the cleanup did not meet the National Contingency Plan’s pro-\ncedural requirements for a remedial action.\n\f15548        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nI.   REMOVAL OR REMEDIAL ACTION: STRUCTURE OF THE\n     TWO-STEP INQUIRY AND APPLICATION TO THE CLEANUP IN\n     LIBBY\n\n   The district court concluded, based on an arbitrary and\ncapricious standard of review, that “[the EPA’s] decision to\nconduct a removal action rather than a remedial action is con-\nsistent with the [National Contingency Plan] and cannot be\nsecond-guessed by this Court.” Grace I, 280 F. Supp. 2d at\n1143. We take a slightly different tack. CERCLA provides\nthat the selection of response actions shall be upheld “unless\narbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with\nthe law.” 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2). We agree that it was not\narbitrary and capricious for the EPA “to approve a time-\ncritical removal action.” Id. at 1144. However, the statutory\nscheme compels us to take the inquiry one step further. See\nMartinez-Villareal v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715827\"><a href=\"/opinion/715827/96-cal-daily-op-serv-2296-96-daily-journal-dar-3852-ramon/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (9th Cir.\n1996) (“We may affirm on any ground supported by the\nrecord even if it differs from the rationale of the district\ncourt.”).\n\n   [1] Under CERCLA, once the response action is selected—\nin this case as a removal based on “an imminent and substan-\ntial danger to the public health”—then the EPA is authorized\nto take necessary actions consistent with the National Contin-\ngency Plan. See 42 U.S.C. § 9604(a)(1). Regulations imple-\nmenting the Plan provide that “[i]f the [EPA] determines that\na removal action is appropriate, actions shall, as appropriate,\nbegin as soon as possible to abate, prevent, minimize, stabi-\nlize, mitigate, or eliminate the threat to public health or wel-\nfare of the United States or the environment.” 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(b)(3). Thus, even if the EPA’s selection of a\nremoval action was proper, the question remains whether the\nactions actually taken by the EPA to combat the threat are\nproperly categorized as such.\n\n  We agree with Grace that this second step of our inquiry is\na question of law: Does the EPA’s response action in Libby\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                  15549\nfall within the statutory limits of a removal action? Grace’s\nchallenge is built on the premise that the EPA termed its\ncleanup in Libby a removal action as a subterfuge when the\nresponse was, in substance, a remedial action.14 To resolve\nthis question, we must explore the statutory confines of\nremoval actions under CERCLA and, within this legal struc-\nture, ask to what extent we should defer to the EPA’s interpre-\ntation based on the agency’s expertise.\n\n  A.       DECISION TO CONDUCT A REMOVAL ACTION IN LIBBY\n\n   The EPA’s initial decision to conduct a removal action\nmust be upheld unless Grace can demonstrate on the adminis-\ntrative record that the decision was arbitrary and capricious or\notherwise not in accordance with law. 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\nGrace has not met this burden.\n\n  [2] The National Contingency Plan requires the EPA to\nconsider a series of factors15 to determine that it was appropri-\n  14\n      Grace attributes the timing and scope of the EPA’s cleanup to intense\nmedia attention regarding conditions in Libby. We have previously\nrejected an “ulterior motive” analysis in a challenge to whether CERCLA\nresponse costs incurred by a private landowner were necessary: “The issue\nis not why the landowner decided to undertake the cleanup, but whether\nit was necessary. To hold otherwise would result in a disincentive for\ncleanup.” Carson Harbor Vill., Ltd. v. Unocal Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775487\"><a href=\"/opinion/775487/carson-harbor-village-ltd-a-limited-partnership-dba-carson-harbor/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871-\n72 (9th Cir. 2001) (en banc) (citation omitted). This logic applies with\nequal force when the EPA is a party. We therefore do not inquire into the\nEPA’s subjective motives behind the cleanup, but rather ask if the objec-\ntive evidence supports the response.\n   15\n      40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2) provides that “[t]he following factors shall\nbe considered in determining the appropriateness of a removal action\n. . . :”\n       (i) Actual or potential exposure to nearby human populations,\n       animals, or the food chain from hazardous substances or pollu-\n       tants or contaminants;\n       (ii) Actual or potential contamination of drinking water supplies\n       or sensitive ecosystems;\n\f15550           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nate to initiate a removal action. Cf. Chapman, 146 F.3d at\n1171-73 (holding that the EPA did not act arbitrarily or capri-\nciously in ordering a removal action after considering the\n§ 300.415(b)(2) factors). The EPA did so and its findings are\nextensively documented.\n\n   The First Action Memo discusses five of the eight factors16\nin concluding that the conditions in Libby presented an immi-\nnent and substantial threat to human health and the environ-\nment that met the regulatory criteria. Chief among the factors\nwas that complete exposure pathways existed through which\npeople were being exposed to asbestos. The First Action\nMemo details specific threats, including that “there are over\n3000 three gallon buckets of unexpanded Libby vermiculite”\nbeing used at a mushroom farm at the former screening plant,\nand that surface soils contained visible vermiculite that could\nreadily migrate.\n\n   The magnitude of the current and potential impact on pub-\nlic health resulting from the widespread use of vermiculite by\nLibby residents led the EPA in its Second Action Memo to\n\n    (iii) Hazardous substances or pollutants or contaminants in\n    drums, barrels, tanks, or other bulk storage containers, that may\n    pose a threat of release;\n    (iv) High levels of hazardous substances or pollutants or contam-\n    inants in soils largely at or near the surface, that may migrate;\n    (v) Weather conditions that may cause hazardous substances or\n    pollutants or contaminants to migrate or be released;\n    (vi) Threat of fire or explosion;\n    (vii) The availability of other appropriate federal or state\n    response mechanisms to respond to the release; and\n     (viii) Other situations or factors that may pose threats to public\n     health or welfare of the United States or the environment.\n  16\n     Specifically, the memo invokes the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sev-\nenth factors listed in 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2).\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.           15551\ninvoke the catch-all eighth factor—“[o]ther situations or fac-\ntors that may pose threats to public health or welfare of the\nUnited States or the environment,” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)\n(2)(viii):\n\n    The sheer magnitude of the medical impact in Libby\n    dictates the need for an expedient and thorough\n    response. Unfortunately, because of the latencies of\n    asbestos related diseases there is no easy way to\n    directly correlate exposure to amphibole asbestos\n    today to the direct development of an asbestos\n    related disease. The only way to determine this for\n    certain is to observe an individual for 10 to 40 years\n    after exposure to see if they become sick. However,\n    waiting for this type of certainty is unconscionable.\n    CERCLA was designed and enacted to prevent ill-\n    ness and death resulting from exposure to hazardous\n    substances, not wait for its occurrence to prove a\n    threat.\n\n   [3] Finally, the Third Action Memo cites several factors in\nsupport of the EPA’s decision to expand the removal action\nand asserts that “[t]he significant medical impact of asbestos\nexposure in Libby dictates the need for an expedient and thor-\nough response.” In light of the EPA’s carefully documented\nreasoning in the three Action Memos, we agree with the dis-\ntrict court that the EPA’s decision to approve a removal action\nwas not arbitrary and capricious. See 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\nThis threshold decision does not, however, end our inquiry.\nWe must consider how to classify the EPA’s action.\n\n  B.   CHARACTERIZATION OF THE EPA’S RESPONSE ACTION\n\n   The question remains whether the steps actually taken by\nthe EPA to combat the threat are properly characterized as a\nremoval action. Whether the EPA’s cleanup activity was a\nremoval action—or, on the other hand, a remedial action in\nremoval action’s clothing—is a question of statutory interpre-\n\f15552         UNITED STATES v.

The\ndecision to select a removal or remedial action is therefore\ndistinct from the question whether the action carried out was,\nin fact, the action selected. It is to this crucial inquiry that we\nnow turn.\n\n   The statutory interpretation of “removal” is a legal issue\nthat we review as a matter of law. See Carson Harbor Vill.,\n270 F.3d at 870. But in addressing the statute, the parties dis-\nagree as to the level of deference, if any, that we should grant\nthe EPA’s formulation of the term “removal.” Resolving this\nquestion requires that we consider the Supreme Court’s recent\nrefinement of the traditional agency-deference analysis under\nChevron. See 467 U.S. at 842-45; United States v. Mead\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226-27 (2001) (Chevron applies “when\nit appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the\nagency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.”).\n\n   Following Mead, the continuum of agency deference has\nbeen fraught with ambiguity. Compare Barnhart v. Walton,\n535 U.S 212, 221 (2002) (applying Chevron deference even\nthough the EPA reached its interpretation through means less\nformal than “notice and comment” rulemaking) with Mead,\n533 U.S. at 226-27 (agency’s tariff classification had “no\nclaim to judicial deference under Chevron, there being no\nindication that Congress intended such a ruling to carry the\nforce of law”). Our decisions understandably have been con-\nflicted as to whether Chevron deference only applies upon\nformal rulemaking and whether lesser deference applies in\nother situations. See, e.g., Cal.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2688</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), calls into question\nwhether Mead in fact “replaced” Chevron as Justice Scalia\ncontends. Perhaps because Brand X involved formal rulemak-\ning, see id. at 2699, the Court did not clarify whether there is\na “deference distinction” between Chevron and Mead. None-\ntheless, in Brand X the majority’s language explaining Chev-\nron is quite broad and does not come with a proviso that the\nChevron deference is limited to agency interpretations\nexpressed through formal rulemaking. See id. (“In Chevron,\nthis Court held that ambiguities in statutes within an agency’s\njurisdiction to administer are delegations of authority to the\nagency to fill the statutory gap in reasonable fashion.”); id. at\n2700 (“Chevron’s premise is that it is for agencies, not courts,\nto fill statutory gaps.”).\n\n  The interplay between Chevron and Mead is highlighted in\nJustice Breyer’s concurrence, in which he writes that “the\nexistence of a formal rulemaking proceeding is neither a nec-\nessary nor a sufficient condition for according Chevron defer-\nence to an agency’s interpretation of a statute.” Id. at 2712\n(Breyer, J., concurring). This explanation stands in contrast to\nJustice Scalia’s dissents in Brand X and Mead. See id. at\n2713-21; Mead, 533 U.S. at 239-61. Echoing his dissent in\nMead, Justice Scalia proffers in his Brand X dissent that\n\f15554        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n“Mead drastically limited the categories of agency action that\nwould qualify for deference under Chevron.” 125 S.Ct. at\n2718 (Scalia, J., dissenting). Rather than clarifying what these\ncategories are, Justice Scalia advances that, in Brand X, the\nCourt “continues the administrative-law improvisation project\nit began four years ago in [Mead].” Id.\n\n   Because the discussion in Brand X leaves some doubt as to\nthe degree of formality of the underlying agency interpreta-\ntion that is required for Chevron deference, we look to the\npost-Mead Supreme Court decision that most closely resem-\nbles the circumstances we face here. The Court explained last\nyear in Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation v.\nEPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"131157\"><a href=\"/opinion/131157/alaska-dept-of-environmental-conservation-v-epa/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487-88 (2004), that the EPA’s interpreta-\ntion of a statute in internal guidance memoranda warrants\nrespect but does not qualify for Chevron deference. Although\nthe Court cited Mead in rejecting Chevron deference, it\naccorded “respect” to the “EPA’s reading of the relevant stat-\nutory provisions.” Id. at 488. Accordingly, at a minimum, we\nimpose a modified deference standard affording respect to the\nEPA’s informal interpretations here. But either under modi-\nfied deference or full Chevron deference, the result would be\nthe same: The EPA’s cleanup activities in Libby are properly\ncategorized as a removal action.\n\n   [4] Despite the EPA’s insistence that arbitrary and capri-\ncious review applies to all aspects of our inquiry, the statute\ndoes not support this reading. CERCLA requires that we\nuphold the EPA’s “decision in selecting the response action”\nunless arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance\nwith the law. 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2). Here we address not the\nEPA’s selection of its remedy, but rather whether the actions\ntaken fall within the statutory definition of a removal. Thus,\nwe consider whether the statutory construction that the EPA\nadvances in this litigation is correct as a matter of law. The\ndegree of deference granted to the EPA’s interpretation of a\nstatute is considered in light of Chevron and its progeny. See\nAlaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conservation, 540 U.S. at 487-88. In\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                    15555\ncontrast, an agency’s actions exercised under its statutory\nauthority are generally subject to arbitrary and capricious\nreview. See id. at 496-97 (applying arbitrary and capricious\nreview to the EPA’s taken actions under the Clean Air Act);\nsee also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (applying arbitrary and capricious\nreview to agency conclusions and findings).\n\n   With the Supreme Court’s recent agency-deference cases as\na backdrop, we begin with Chevron’s first step and ask\n“whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question\nat issue,” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842, i.e., whether a response\naction such as the one carried out in Libby is a removal or\nremedial action.17 If Congress has “unambiguously expressed\n[its] intent,” then our inquiry ends there, for that intent must\nbe given effect as law. Id. at 842-43. If, however, the statute\nis ambiguous, then we look to the EPA’s interpretation of the\nstatute.

Put simply, even if EPA manuals, policy statements,\nand other pronouncements “are beyond the Chevron pale,”\nMead, 533 U.S. at 234, they are not beyond the reach of our\ndeference.\n\n   As elaborated below, the statutory definition of “removal”\nis vague and, consequently, the EPA’s construction of this\nstatutory term warrants our deference. In light of this defer-\nence and the well-documented record of the scope of cleanup\nactivity, we hold that the EPA’s action in Libby is properly\ncharacterized as a removal action. In so holding, we recognize\nthat the emphasis on time-sensitivity both in the EPA’s selec-\ntion of a removal action and in our decision whether the\naction carried out actually was a removal action threatens to\ncollapse the two issues into a single “immediacy” inquiry.\nOur review of the EPA’s decision to conduct a removal action\nis limited to whether the EPA considered the eight factors\nunder 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(2). In contrast, although imme-\ndiacy is a paramount consideration when evaluating whether\nthe action indeed was a removal, this second phase of our\ninquiry is not bound by those eight factors. For example, we\nalso consider, among other things, the interplay between a\nremoval and remedial action conducted at a single site and\nwhether the action comports with the examples in 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e).\n\n   Grace contests the denomination of the action as a removal\nby cherry-picking discrete cleanup activities which, standing\nalone, might fall within the ambit of a remedial action. We\nrefrain from slicing and dicing the EPA’s single, cohesive\nremoval action into a myriad of fractured parts. Such atomiza-\ntion would undermine the EPA’s scientific and administrative\nexpertise by requiring us to second-guess whether, for exam-\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15557\nple, the excavation of soil at the local elementary school was\na remedial action because 1000 cubic yards of soil was\nremoved when perhaps removal of less soil or less drastic\nmeasures could have been employed to counteract the imme-\ndiate threat. Instead, we take a more comprehensive view of\nthe administrative record in concluding that the EPA’s\nresponse was a removal action.\n\n    1.   STATUTORY INTERPRETATION: REMOVAL AND\n         REMEDIAL ACTIONS\n\n   [5] The first step under Chevron requires a straightforward\nexercise in statutory interpretation: “If a court, employing tra-\nditional tools of statutory interpretation, ascertains that Con-\ngress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that\nintention is the law and must be given effect.” Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843 n.9.\n\n   We begin with the statutory definitions because “[w]hen a\nstatute includes an explicit definition, we must follow that\ndefinition, even if it varies from that term’s ordinary mean-\ning.” Stenberg v. Carhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118387\"><a href=\"/opinion/118387/stenberg-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942 (2000). It has\nbecome de rigueur to criticize CERCLA as a hastily passed\nstatute that is far from a paragon of legislative clarity. See,\ne.g., Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111612\"><a href=\"/opinion/111612/exxon-corp-v-hunt/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 363 (1986) (com-\nmenting that a provision in CERCLA “is not a model of legis-\nlative draftsmanship”); Carson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 883\n(“Clearly, neither a logician nor a grammarian will find com-\nfort in the world of CERCLA.”). The definitions of removal\nand remedial action exemplify this muddled language. See 42\nU.S.C. § 9601(23) (defining “removal”); id. § 9601(24)\n(defining “remedial action”); id. § 9601(25) (defining “re-\nsponse”); see also supra notes 4, 6 (quoting definitions).\n\n   The definition of “removal” is written in sweeping terms.\nIt begins with the general statement that “removal” means\n“the cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances\nfrom the environment.” 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23). The definition\n\f15558         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\ngoes on to describe three categories of events that trigger\nremoval: (1) “such actions as may be necessary [sic] taken in\nthe event of the threat of release of hazardous substances into\nthe environment”; (2) “such actions as may be necessary to\nmonitor, assess, and evaluate the release or threat of release\nof hazardous substances”; and a third catch-all category,\n(3) “such other actions as may be necessary to prevent, mini-\nmize, or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to\nthe environment, which may otherwise result from a release\nor threat of release.” Id.\n\n   Finally, the definition lists a number of specific activities\nthat fall within the definition of “removal”—“alternative\nwater supplies,” “temporary evacuation and housing,” and\n“emergency assistance.” Although at first glance this half of\nthe definition appears to provide concrete guidance by listing\nidentifiable activities such as “security fencing,” this part too\nis left vague by the opening caveat that the term “removal”\n“includes, in addition, without being limited to, security fenc-\ning . . . .” Id. Consequently, “these examples serve only as a\nguide to what activities may appropriately be classified as\n‘removal action.’ ” Hanford Downwinders Coalition, 71 F.3d\nat 1478 n.13.\n\n   The definition of “remedial action” is similarly broad, but\ncan be distinguished from “removal” because it refers to “per-\nmanent” remedies and its list of specific actions is, in large\npart, distinct from the list included under “removal.” (For\nexample, “removal” is focused on temporary and emergency\nactivities.) To begin, the definition states that a “remedial\naction” is an action “consistent with permanent remedy taken\ninstead of or in addition to removal actions.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9601(24). Although the section begins with this clear lan-\nguage, it threatens to collapse into the definition of “removal”\nbecause it includes those actions “taken instead of or in addi-\ntion to removal actions” and is triggered “in the event of a\nrelease or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the\nenvironment, to prevent or minimize the release of hazardous\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15559\nsubstances so that they do not migrate to cause substantial\ndanger to present or future public health or welfare or the\nenvironment.” Id. Thus, the triggering factors begin to sound\nvirtually similar to the triggering factors for a “removal”\naction. In fact, two of the triggering factors for “removal” are\nalmost identical to the factors for “remedy”:\n\n\n Removal — 42 U.S.C.              Remedy — 42 U.S.C.\n § 9601(23)                       § 9601(24)\n\n “such actions as may be          “those actions consistent\n necessary [sic] taken in the     with permanent remedy\n event of the threat of release   taken in the event of a\n of hazardous substances into     release or threatened release\n the environment”                 of hazardous substances into\n                                  the environment”\n\n “such other actions as may       “those actions consistent\n be necessary to prevent,         with permanent remedy\n minimize, or mitigate dam-       taken to prevent or mini-\n age to the public health or      mize the release of hazard-\n welfare or to the environ-       ous substances so that they\n ment, which may otherwise        do not migrate to cause sub-\n result from a release or         stantial danger to present or\n threat of release”               future public health or wel-\n                                  fare or the environment”\n\n\n   The definition concludes with three lists of specific exam-\nples classified as a remedy, such as “segregation of reactive\nwastes.” The first list details various locations of the release.\nAs with the term “removal,” the definition for the first list\ndiminishes the examples’ guidance with the qualifying lan-\nguage that the term “includes, but is not limited to,” the listed\nexamples. Id. The second list spells out when permanent relo-\ncation of residents, businesses, and community facilities is\n\f15560           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nappropriate. Finally, the third list is a list of actions included\nwithin “remedy,” ranging from offsite storage to disposition\nof hazardous substances.\n\n   Adding to the confusion is the overlap between the two def-\ninitions. See Neville Chem. Co., 358 F.3d at 667 (noting list-\ning of “provision of alternative water supplies” under both\n“remedial action” and “removal”); Geraghty & Miller, 234\nF.3d at 927 (noting overlap). Attempting to untie the Gordian\nknot of these definitions solely based on their plain meanings\nis thus unavailing.19\n\n   In interpreting “removal” and “remedial,” we next follow\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance in taking a comprehensive,\nholistic view of CERCLA because it is a “fundamental canon\nof statutory construction that the words of a statute must be\nread in their context and with a view to their place in the over-\nall statutory scheme.” FDA v.

W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   [7] Unfortunately, legislative history is particularly unhelp-\nful because of the haphazard passage of CERCLA with many\nof the more lucid descriptions of the statute falling under the\noxymoronic category of post-enactment “history.” See, e.g.,\n126 Cong. Rec. S16,428 (daily ed. Dec. 12, 1980), reprinted\nin 1 The Environmental Law Institute, Superfund: A Legisla-\ntive History 87 (Helen Cohn Needham & Mark Menefee eds.,\n1982) (hereinafter “Superfund History”) (post-passage “clari-\nfication” by Sen.

Considering that no\ncommittee or conference reports address the version of CER-\nCLA that ultimately became law, it is apt to describe the\nsearch for legislative history as “somewhat of a snark hunt.”\nCarson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 885.\n\n   Without the benefit of a definitive committee report or\nother deliberate congressional documents describing the gene-\nsis of the final bill, we are hesitant to rely on legislative his-\ntory for guidance, especially in regard to the nuanced inquiry\nas to which side an action falls on the removal/remedial line.\nSee United States v.

Such statements encourage us to con-\nstrue “removal” liberally to effectuate CERCLA’s remedial\npurpose, but they do not illuminate the removal/remedial dis-\ntinction. Cf.

The\nmeanings of “removal” and “remedial action” under CER-\nCLA are inescapably vague.\n\n    2.   DEFERENCE TO THE EPA’S CHARACTERIZATION\n\n   Having concluded that Congress did not draw a clear line\nbetween removal and remedial actions, we turn to the second\nstep under Chevron and ask whether, in view of the deference\nowed to the EPA, the Libby cleanup was a removal action as\na matter of law. As noted earlier, the level of deference we\naccord to a given agency interpretation is directed by its form.\n\f15564           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   [9] The administrative posture of CERCLA presents two\ntypes of agency interpretations. One is the National Contin-\ngency Plan, which carries the force of law.20 The second\nrelates to informal agency interpretations, which at a mini-\nmum receive respect and, depending on the interplay of Mead\nand Brand X, may even deserve Chevron deference. Which-\never of these applies, we reach the same result: We hold that\nthe EPA has rationally construed CERCLA and that construc-\ntion deserves our respect. Cf. Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conser-\nvation, 540 U.S. at 485-88 (EPA “rationally construed” Clean\nAir Act in internal guidance memoranda, which construction\ndeserved “respect and approbation” but not Chevron defer-\nence). As interpreted by the EPA, the removal/remedial dis-\ntinction boils down to whether the exigencies of the situation\nwere such that the EPA did not have time to undertake the\nprocedural steps required for a remedial action, and, in\nresponding to such a time-sensitive threat, the EPA sought to\nminimize and stabilize imminent harms to human health and\nthe environment. The EPA did so here.\n\n   The definitions of “removal” and “remedial action” in the\nEPA-promulgated National Contingency Plan merely parrot\nCERCLA’s definitions, aside from a few minor revisions for\nthe National Contingency Plan context. See, e.g., 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.5 (replacing “EPA” for “the President” in definition of\n“remedial action” and noting that, for the purpose of the\nNational Contingency Plan, “remedial” and “removal”\ninclude enforcement activities related thereto). Because these\ndefinitions do nothing to interpret the definitions in CERCLA,\nthey are unhelpful to our inquiry.\n   20\n      40 C.F.R. § 300.2 explains that the President delegated to the EPA\n“the responsibility for the amendment of the [National Contingency\nPlan].” See also id. (“The [National Contingency Plan] is applicable to\nresponse actions taken pursuant to the authorities under CERCLA . . . .”);\nVigil v. Leavitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787556\"><a href=\"/opinion/787556/martha-vigil-andy-blackledge-and-robin-silver-v-michael-o-leavitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 834 (9th Cir. 2004) (“Congress has given\nEPA general rulemaking authority, which, when exercised, requires our\ndeference in accordance with Chevron.”) (citation omitted).\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15565\n   That being said, other parts of the National Contingency\nPlan offer some guidance. For instance, 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e) sets forth examples of activities that are “as a\ngeneral rule,” appropriate as part of a removal action, but\nnotes that the list “is not exhaustive and is not intended to pre-\nvent the lead agency from taking any other actions deemed\nnecessary under CERCLA.” See also 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23)\n(providing that the scope of removals is not limited to the\nexamples in the statutory definition). The examples include,\namong others, fences or other site control precautions; cap-\nping of contaminated soils to reduce migration; excavation,\nconsolidation, or removal of highly contaminated soils; and\nremoval and treatment of hazardous materials where it will\nreduce the likelihood of human exposure. 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415(e). The bulk of activities carried out in Libby easily\nfall within the scope of the listed examples. For instance, the\nEPA removed hazardous soil from the screening plant,\nrestricted access to contaminated roads, installed a temporary\ncover on a school’s ice skating rink, excavated and backfilled\ncontaminated soil, and removed exposed piles of vermiculite.\n\n   [10] Although “immediacy” is not used in the definition of\n“removal” either in CERCLA or the National Contingency\nPlan, the examples in 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(e) imply a level of\nurgency in addressing the threat both by expressly using the\nword “immediately,” see id. § 300.415(e)(9) (providing alter-\nnative water supply “where necessary immediately to reduce\nexposure to contaminated household water”), and by describ-\ning looming threats against which prompt action is needed,\nsee, e.g., id. § 300.415(e)(4) (capping contaminated soils\n“where needed to reduce migration of hazardous substances\n. . . into soil, ground or surface water, or air”). Not surpris-\ningly, the criteria used to determine whether the selection of\na removal action is appropriate are similarly infused with this\nsense of immediacy. See, e.g., id. § 300.415(b)(2)(iv) (factors\ninclude whether there are hazardous substances in soils\n“largely at or near the surface, that may migrate”).\n\f15566           UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n   The need for immediate action permeates the EPA’s activi-\nties in Libby. The toxicologist’s May 17, 2000, report that\nwas attached to the First Action Memo concludes that\n“[a]irborne fiber concentrations in the residential area of\nLibby exceeded the present occupational Permissible Expo-\nsure Level (PEL) of 0.1 fiber/cubic centimeter established by\nOSHA 1994 (MRI, 1982).”21 These levels translated into an\nimmediate public health threat because, as documented in the\nhealth consultation by the Agency for Toxic Substances and\nDisease Registry, complete exposure pathways were present\naround Libby. For example, EPA investigations found deteri-\norating bags of vermiculite at the former screening plant, as\nwell as vermiculite tailings at the surface of a walking path\nnext to the Libby High School track. And the dilapidated con-\ndition of houses was such that “[i]n some Libby homes, ver-\nmiculite insulation is literally falling out into the living space\nfrom gaps around light fixtures and electrical switches.” That\nthese particles were present in people’s homes and schools is\nespecially troubling because, in contrast to standards set by\nOSHA for workers who are exposed to particles during an\neight-hour workday, home and school contamination could\nresult in exposure for twenty-four hours per day. In short, the\ncarcinogenic fibers were widespread and, contrary to Grace’s\nassertions, were not contained such that they would not be\ninhaled. As ominously observed by the EPA, “Of course once\nairborne, the fibers will migrate whichever way the wind\nblows.”\n\n   The sequence of activities in Libby further comports with\nthe EPA’s description in the National Contingency Plan of the\npreferred development of response actions. The National Con-\ntingency Plan provides that the agency should orderly transi-\n  21\n    The Permissible Exposure Level is for eight hours, not twenty-four.\nAlthough Grace argues that the EPA’s toxicologist’s report is incorrect, it\ndoes not cite to the report of any other experts who concluded otherwise.\nNor does Grace cite to any provisions of OSHA that require a different\nprotocol for the taking of samples which the EPA’s expert did not follow.\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R.

This progression is evi-\ndenced by the three Action Memos for Libby, which began by\ncalling for a removal action but later paved the way for a\nremedial action.22 Indeed, the First Action Memo notes that\nthe proposed removal action “should compliment and contrib-\nute to the overall success of any remedial actions in the\nfuture.” The Third Action Memo further states, “Continued\nresponse actions are appropriate and consistent with the reme-\ndial actions to be taken.” Thus, the EPA conducted its\nremoval action in Libby not in lieu of a remedial action, but\nrather as a prelude to a comprehensive remedial action.\n\n   Looking beyond the National Contingency Plan, the EPA’s\ncharacterization of response actions in documents that do not\nhave the heft of regulations still carry weight because\n“[c]ogent ‘administrative interpretations . . . not [the] products\nof formal rulemaking . . . nevertheless warrant respect.’ ”\nAlaska Dep’t of Envtl.

Accordingly, the action in Libby is not disqualified\nfrom being a removal action just because it took several years.\nCf. Vill. of Milford v. K-H Holding Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788505\"><a href=\"/opinion/788505/village-of-milford-v-k-h-holding-corporation-a-foreign-corporation-trw/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934\n(6th Cir. 2004) (explaining that the court has “never held” that\nthe short-term nature of an action is required for finding costs\nrecoverable as removal costs). The length of the cleanup in\nLibby is especially understandable given that harsh winters\ntruncated the construction season and that the sheer magni-\ntude of the initial cleanup far exceeded the normal situation\nfaced by the EPA. Cf. Sunoco, 337 F.3d at 1244 (concluding\n\f15570         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthat action was a removal in part because it was finished in\nabout 14 months, “a relatively short time frame in the context\nof a clean-up lasting more than a decade in a harsh environ-\nment” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n   Likewise, the Removal Memo describes courts’ reliance on\nthe “permanence” of the response as “sometimes misleading”:\n“As a practical matter, removal actions are often permanent\nsolutions such as can be the case in a typical soil or drum\nremoval.” Removal Memo, supra, at 3 n.3; cf. Geraghty &\nMiller, 234 F.3d at 927 (“Even if the replacements for these\nwells are integral to the long-term remediation of the site, that\ndoes not mean that their initial placement cannot be catego-\nrized as removal.”). This observation seems logical, as we do\nnot want to tie the EPA’s hands or compel it to adopt short-\nterm remedies for fear that any more permanent solutions\nautomatically will be dubbed “remedial actions.” Nor would\nit make economic or practical sense to impose a requirement\nthat removal actions must be only temporary in nature. The\nRemoval Memo instead uses the term “comprehensiveness”\nto distinguish between the use of removal authority to conduct\ninterim or partial response actions that are focused on imme-\ndiate risk reduction as compared with a final or “comprehen-\nsive” response at the site. Removal Memo, supra, at 3 n.3.\nThe Libby cleanup exhibits this two-tier approach of an\ninterim removal action that the EPA transforms into a com-\nprehensive remedial action. Cf. Geraghty & Miller, 234 F.3d\nat 926 (noting that “removal actions generally are immediate\nor interim responses”).\n\n   These informal interpretations combined with the descrip-\ntions in the National Contingency Plan provide a persuasive\ninterpretation that removal actions encompass interim, partial\ntime-sensitive responses taken to counter serious threats to\npublic health. As the EPA explained in the Second Action\nMemo, “CERCLA was designed and enacted to prevent ill-\nness and death resulting from exposure to hazardous sub-\nstances, not wait for its occurrence to prove a threat.”\n\f             UNITED STATES v.

GRACE & CO.           15571\n   Grace attempts to add another layer of complexity to our\nanalysis by challenging various scientific and other methodol-\nogy judgments made by the EPA as part of the cleanup. Once\nwe determine that a response action on the whole is, by\nnature, classified as a removal action under the law, we will\nnot delve further to second-guess the underlying data absent\na showing of specific evidence that the EPA’s conclusions\nwere not warranted. See Balt. Gas and Elec. Co. v. Natural\nRes. Def.

(“When examin-\ning this kind of scientific determination, as opposed to simple\nfindings of fact, a reviewing court must generally be at its\nmost deferential.”). Although Grace argues in its briefs that\nthe EPA’s data and conclusions were wrong, it did not present\nevidence to support its claim that the EPA’s selection of a\nremoval action was arbitrary and capricious, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9613(j)(2), or that its characterization of the action as a\nremoval action did not comport with the statutory definition,\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 9601(23). Of course, the EPA does not have\nfree rein to ignore accepted scientific principle or to adopt\nfindings that are wholly at odds with the record evidence. See\nGreat Basin Mine Watch v.

The\nadministrative record includes, for instance, the EPA’s\n\f15572         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nresponse to Grace’s contention that the EPA “inappropriately\ncalculated PCMEs [phase contrast microscopy equivalents] if\nthose findings are going to be compared to the OSHA PEL\n[Occupational Safety & Health Administration permissible\nexposure limits].” We are not scientists, nor do we intend to\nplay armchair EPA administrator. But we are judges and it is\nour role to evaluate the record evidence against the standard\nof review. We defer to the EPA’s reasoned judgment. See\nSunoco, 337 F.3d at 1243 (“[Skidmore] deference seems par-\nticularly appropriate where an action reasonably can be classi-\nfied as both ‘removal’ and ‘remedial’ under CERCLA’s\ncomplex definitional provisions.”).\n\n   The EPA’s scientific basis for finding an immediate threat\nto the public health is thoroughly documented over thousands\nof pages. In addition to the detailed evaluation of the threat in\nthe three Action Memos, the administrative record includes,\nfor example, comprehensive reports by both the EPA’s\nregional toxicologist and senior toxicologist explaining the\nimminent and substantial endangerment to public health in\nLibby, extensive responses by the EPA to Grace’s comments\non the cleanup, and lengthy findings by the Agency for Toxic\nSubstances and Disease Registry on medical testing con-\nducted on Libby residents. In particular, the Agency’s Febru-\nary 22, 2001, report documents findings from its study\nconducted from July through November 2000 in which 1,078\npeople participated. Of those participants, the findings can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\f                UNITED STATES v. W.R.

W.R. GRACE & CO.\n    Studies of differing groups within the United States\n    believed to have no substantive work-related asbes-\n    tos exposures have found the prevalence of pleural\n    abnormalities ranging from 0.02% among blue-collar\n    workers in North Carolina [Castellan 1985], to 0.9%\n    among loggers in Washington and Oregon [Stilbolt\n    1991], to 1.8% among New Jersey residents [Ander-\n    son 1979], and 2.3% among patients at Veterans\n    Administration hospitals in New Jersey [Miller JA\n    1996].\n\n   Further, in response to the EPA’s request that the Agency\nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry comment on\nwhether the proposed removal action was appropriate to pro-\ntect the public health, the Agency concluded in a May 17,\n2000, report that “Asbestos contamination is present at the\nscreening plant and export plant at levels that pose a public\nhealth hazard. The time critical removal action proposed by\nEPA is warranted to protect the public health.”\n\n   Beyond the findings that prompted the EPA to undertake\nthe removal action, the administrative record also documents\nthe concrete steps taken to combat this threat, such as remov-\ning vermiculite tailings from under and around running tracks\nat local schools, covering and demarcating major contami-\nnated areas at residential properties, and cleaning the interiors\nof infected homes.\n\n   [11] In sum, given the sweeping language in the definition\nof “removal,” the significant deference due to the EPA’s\ninterpretation of this language, and the scope of the interim\ncleanup, we hold that the EPA’s cleanup in Libby falls within\nthe bounds of a removal action. The EPA “has rationally con-\nstrued the Act’s text and [the] EPA’s construction warrants\nour respect and approbation.” Alaska Dep’t of Envtl. Conser-\nvation, 540 U.S. at 485. This holding comports with CER-\nCLA’s fundamental goal of protecting the public health. See,\ne.g., Hanford Downwinders Coalition, 71 F.3d at 1481\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15575\n(“[T]his circuit has joined others in recognizing that protec-\ntion of the public health was one of the remedial goals of\nCERCLA.”). Considering the chaotic history behind CER-\nCLA’s passage, we are particularly sensitive not to adopt a\nreading that would undermine its remedial purpose. See Clark\nv. Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104480\"><a href=\"/opinion/104480/clark-v-uebersee-finanz-korp-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 488 (1947)\n(advising that courts should not adopt an interpretation of stat-\nutory language that would “run counter to the policy of the\nAct and be disruptive of its purpose . . . [when] dealing with\nhasty legislation which Congress did not stop to perfect as an\nintegrated whole”).\n\n   [12] In so holding, we recognize that Congress created a\nbifurcated scheme of removal and remedial actions and,\naccordingly, there must be outer limits to removal actions.\nBut the EPA did not exceed these limits in this case. Nor need\nwe delineate the outer parameters. We simply conclude that\nthe EPA’s characterization of the cleanup in Libby as a\nremoval action is amply supported by the administrative\nrecord and easily withstands scrutiny under the modified level\nof interpretive deference afforded by Mead and Alaska\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. Although defer-\nence to the EPA’s interpretation is significant, it is not blind.\nCourts must, as a matter of law, ultimately determine that the\nEPA’s characterization of a given response action accords\nwith CERCLA, as we so determine here.\n\n   [13] Crucial to our determination is the documented evi-\ndence that, absent immediate attention, the airborne toxic par-\nticles would continue to pose a substantial threat to public\nhealth. To combat this widespread, looming threat, the EPA\nhad no choice but to undertake an aggressive removal action\nof an expansive scope. The removal activities easily fall\nwithin the statutory definition of removal. Notably, the defini-\ntions for removal and remedial actions consciously include\nsome overlap. Because of the nature of the contaminant, some\nof the measures taken by the EPA as part of the removal\naction might also effect a permanent solution for a particular\n\f15576          UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nlocation (e.g., removing exposed piles of vermiculite). But by\nno means did the removal action fully eliminate the public\nhealth threat or amount to a full-blown remediation. Accord-\ning to the EPA’s CERCLIS database, the EPA is continuing\nwork to ensure that potential or actual human exposures are\nunder control. See http://cfpub1.epa.gov/supercpad/cursites/\ncsitinfo.cfm?id=0801744 (last visited July 26, 2005).\nAlthough Libby’s problems appear far from solved, the EPA\nis making progress. As envisioned by CERCLA, the EPA\nplans to effect a comprehensive resolution to the asbestos\ncontamination through the pending remedial action.\n\nII.   EXEMPTIONS FROM THE $2 MILLION, 12-MONTH\n      STATUTORY CAP APPLICABLE TO REMOVAL ACTIONS\n\n   Having determined that the action is properly characterized\nas a removal action, the inquiry turns to whether the EPA can\nrecover costs in excess of the $2 million, 12-month statutory\ncap on removal actions. See 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5). The\ndistrict court found persuasive the EPA’s explanations in the\nAction Memos of the immediate risk to public health. Grace\nI, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1144. We agree and hold that, consider-\ning the widespread and pervasive asbestos contamination and\nthe potential for further migration of asbestos fibers as docu-\nmented in the Action Memos, the EPA’s decision to exceed\nthe statutory cap was not arbitrary and capricious.\n\n  [14] We begin with the language of 42 U.S.C. § 9604(c)(1):\n\n      Unless (A) [the EPA] finds that (i) continued\n      response actions are immediately required to pre-\n      vent, limit, or mitigate an emergency, (ii) there is an\n      immediate risk to public health or welfare or the\n      environment, and (iii) such assistance will not other-\n      wise be provided on a timely basis, . . . obligations\n      from the Fund . . . shall not continue after\n      $2,000,000 has been obligated for response actions\n      or 12 months has elapsed from the date of initial\n\f                  UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.                 15577\n       response to a release or threatened release of hazard-\n       ous substances.\n\nSee also 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5) (limiting actions to $2\nmillion and 12 months “unless the lead agency determines\nthat” one of the exemptions applies). Despite Grace’s asser-\ntion that the decision to exceed the cap is not subject to arbi-\ntrary and capricious review, the fact that the statute allows the\nEPA to invoke the exemptions when it “finds” certain condi-\ntions counsels otherwise. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (courts should\nset aside agency conclusions and findings where “arbitrary,\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-\ndance with law”). The EPA’s determinations in this case that\nthere was an emergency, that the risk to public health was\nimmediate, and that the assistance would not otherwise be\nforthcoming are inherently fact-based.\n\n  In the First Action Memo, the EPA determined that the\nremoval action met the three statutory elements required to\nexceed the cap. See § 9604(c)(1)(A). Namely, (1) the asbestos\nin the environment posed an immediate threat to the local\npopulation; (2) a cleanup beyond the cap was required to pre-\nvent, limit, or mitigate an emergency25 because of the size of\n  25\n    The term “emergency” is not defined in CERLCA or the National\nContingency Plan, and the EPA has interpreted it to include a range of\ntime-sensitive threats:\n       Not all actions begin under what are commonly thought of as\n       “emergency” conditions. Though events such as tire fires, train\n       derailments, and chemical explosions require immediate action,\n       other less dramatic threats to public health are addressed under\n       EPA’s Emergency Response and Removal Program. Such threats\n       include the discovery of leaking drums or tanks at an abandoned\n       factory or complaints of tainted drinking water near a landfill.\n       Regardless of the circumstances, quick and efficient cleanup of\n       hazardous material eliminates risks to people and the environ-\n       ment and minimizes the stigma contamination can bring to prop-\n       erties and communities.\nRemoval Program Report, supra, at 3.\n\f15578        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthe cleanup and the short construction season; and (3) assis-\ntance from other government agencies was not anticipated on\na timely basis. The Second Action Memo reiterated this reli-\nance on the “emergency exemption,” explaining that “[a]t all\nthe locations discussed in this Action Memorandum if\nRemoval Actions are not initiated or continued then people\nwill be exposed to unsafe levels of amphibole asbestos.” In\nlight of the EPA’s documentation of complete exposure path-\nways and the resulting continuing threat to public health, we\nhold that the EPA “articulate[d] a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the conclusions made.” Envtl. Def. Ctr.,\n344 F.3d at 858 n.36.\n\n   Turning to the Third Action Memo, the EPA continued its\nreliance on the emergency exemption, once again citing the\nstatutory factors and explaining that a continued removal\naction was necessary to prevent exposure to unsafe levels of\nasbestos. In addition, the EPA relied on the “consistency\nexemption,” which allows for a continued removal action\nover the cap when it is “otherwise appropriate and consistent\nwith the remedial action to be taken.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 9604(c)(1)(C); see also 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(b)(5)(ii) (corre-\nsponding provision). At the time the Third Action Memo was\nreleased, the EPA had proposed Libby to the National Priori-\nties List but it had not yet been listed. Thus, as envisioned in\nthe Action Memos, the removal action in Libby was not an\nexhaustive cleanup effort. Rather, the EPA has segued into\nthe remedial phase and, in the interim, found that “[c]ontinued\nresponse actions are appropriate and consistent with the reme-\ndial actions to be taken.”\n\n   On a practical level, the need to exceed the cap is not sur-\nprising given the urgency, magnitude, and long-standing\nnature of the problem. First, the tremendous scope of the\nremoval in Libby made the $2 million ceiling unworkable. An\nentire town needed to be cleaned up, not just a mobile home\npark, Carson Harbor Vill., 270 F.3d at 867, or a “five-acre\nparcel of land,” Chapman, 146 F.3d at 1168. In contrast to\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15579\nthese localized threats, the EPA explained in its response to\ncomments received from Grace in December 2001 that it still\nhad more than 2000 properties to sample around Libby.\n\n   The 12-month limit was also impractical given both the\nscale of the effort and the meteorological reality of the harsh\nconditions, which result in a short construction season and\nthus necessitate several years to complete cleanup activities\nthat might be completed considerably faster in a more temper-\nate climate. The severe winters and hot summers are further\nproblematic in that they exacerbate the spread of asbestos par-\nticles through wind and erosion. Cleansing the site of these\nwidespread particles requires such labor-intensive acts as bulk\nremoval of contaminated materials followed by thorough\ncleaning and vacuuming of the houses.\n\n   [15] Given these daunting realities and the EPA’s careful\ndocumentation of its reasons for invoking the emergency and\nconsistency exemptions, we hold that the EPA’s decision to\nexceed the statutory cap was based on the relevant factors,\nthere has been no clear error of judgment, and the decision\nwas not arbitrary and capricious.

Nat’l Res.\nCouncil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112256\"><a href=\"/opinion/112256/marsh-v-oregon-natural-resources-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (1989); Envtl. Def. Ctr., 344 F.3d\nat 858 n.36. Therefore, the EPA is entitled to recover the full\ncosts of its removal action in Libby as found by the district\ncourt.\n\nIII.   INDIRECT COSTS CALCULATION\n\n   Finally, Grace complains that the methodology used to cal-\nculate indirect costs of $11,322,226 overstated the EPA’s\ncosts attributable to the Libby response action. See Grace II,\n280 F. Supp. 2d at 1173, 1187 (calculating indirect costs).\nGrace disputes the use of total site-specific costs as the basis\nfor calculating indirect costs, arguing that because the EPA\ndelegated substantial authority to the U.S. Department of\nTransportation, the EPA’s overhead was substantially lower\n\f15580         UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nthan it would have been had the EPA administered the entire\nproject directly.\n\n   After review of the district court’s extensive findings on the\nindirect costs methodology and its application to this particu-\nlar case, see id. at 1167-73, we conclude that the district court\ndid not err in its award of indirect costs. See W. Props. Serv.\nCorp. v. Shell Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785140\"><a href=\"/opinion/785140/western-properties-service-corporation-an-arizona-corporation-v-shell-oil/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(“The district court’s findings of fact can be reversed only if\nclearly erroneous, and not merely because we might have\nfound otherwise on the same evidence.”).\n\n   [16] CERCLA authorizes the EPA to recover “all costs of\nremoval or remedial action . . .

United States\nv. R.W. Meyer, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532570\"><a href=\"/opinion/532570/united-states-v-rw-meyer-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1503-04 (6th Cir. 1989)\n(calculating indirect costs using labor hours method). In con-\ntrast, the new “full cost” methodology allocates indirect costs\nbased on the total site-specific expenditures incurred for a\nparticular site.\n\f             UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15581\n   The EPA explains that the labor hours method was rejected\nbecause it did not identify the full costs of Superfund site\ncleanups, and the revised methodology is a better process for\nestimating and allocating the total Superfund overhead costs.\nThe revised methodology is also supported by reports from\nthe General Accounting Office and the accounting firm\nKPMG, which found that the full cost approach complies with\nthe federal government’s costs accounting standards. See\nGrace II, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1171-72; see also Guidance on\nExercising CERCLA Enforcement Discretion in Anticipation\nof Full Cost Accounting Consistent With the “Statement of\nFederal Financial Accounting Standards No. 4,” 65 Fed. Reg.\n35, 339 (EPA June 2, 2000).\n\n   [17] In awarding the EPA $11.32 million in indirect costs,\nthe district court found that the “EPA’s revised methodology\nis an appropriate accounting measure of its indirect costs\ncharged to Superfund sites, including the Libby Asbestos\nSite.” Grace II, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 1169. The district court\nreached this conclusion after a three-day trial and detailed\nfindings. Grace characterizes this conclusion as a legal error\nmeriting de novo review. We disagree. The district court’s\napproach comports with the statute; the court’s findings on\nthe methodology and its application to this case are supported\nby the record, id. at 1167-73, and we will not overturn them\nexcept for clear error. See W. Props. Serv. Corp., 358 F.3d at\n685. Besides, we do not think it is in anyone’s interest to have\nappellate courts step into the accountants’ shoes and deter-\nmine the accuracy of accounting calculations de novo.\nGrace’s arguments do not rise to the level of demonstrating\nthat the district court’s findings were clearly erroneous. We\nare particularly hesitant to second-guess the district court’s\njudgment on this issue where the court specifically found that\nGrace’s accounting expert was “not credible.” Grace II, 280\nF. Supp. 2d at 1169, 1171 (“[Grace’s] accounting expert . . .\ndoes not know what methodology the EPA should use to\nrecover its indirect costs.”).\n\f15582        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\n                         CONCLUSION\n\n   We AFFIRM the district court’s order granting the EPA\nsummary judgment on the liability issue. We also AFFIRM\nthe district court’s order awarding the EPA $54,527,081.11 in\ncosts and a declaratory judgment on the liability of Grace for\nfuture costs.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\nBEA, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n   I concur in the result that the majority reaches. The EPA’s\nactivities in Libby, Montana, when taken as a whole, are\nproperly classified as a removal action in response to the\nimmediate threat posed by the large quantities of friable\nasbestos found in Libby. See, e.g., Majority Opinion at\np.15576 ante (noting that EPA toxicologist reported that\nLibby residents were being exposed to airborne asbestos in\nexcess of OSHA’s permissible occupational exposure level).\nAccordingly, I would uphold the EPA’s classification of its\nLibby response action under Mead as opposed to Chevron\ndeference. See United States v. Mead Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n234-35 (2001).\n\n   Under CERCLA, the EPA can recover “all costs of removal\nor remedial action . . . not inconsistent with the national con-\ntingency plan.” 42 U.S.C. § 9607(a)(4)(A). The regulations\nset forth the national contingency plan standards governing\nthe EPA’s selection of a response action. See 40 C.F.R.\n§ 300.415. In conducting judicial review, this court “shall\nuphold the President’s decision in selecting the response\naction unless the objecting party can demonstrate, on the\nadministrative record, that the decision was arbitrary and\ncapricious or otherwise not in accordance with the law.” 42\nU.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\n\f              UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.            15583\n   The national contingency plan regulations governing\nremoval action also provide that “[i]n determining the appro-\npriate extent of action to be taken in response to a given\nrelease, the lead agency shall first review the removal site\nevaluation, any information produced through a remedial site\nevaluation . . . and the current site conditions, to determine if\nremoval action is appropriate.” 40 C.F.R. § 300.415(a)(1).\nThus, the regulations govern not only the EPA’s selection of\na response action, but also its determination of the extent of\na response action. Id. at 300.415(a)(1). I would also review\nthis latter determination under the arbitrary and capricious\nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\n\n   For example, the EPA’s decision to excavate the vermicu-\nlite tailings buried beneath the Libby Middle School track\nwarrants scrutiny. According to a letter from the superinten-\ndent of Libby’s schools, the EPA had concluded that “[s]ince\nthe asbestos . . . detected is all at depth and, in some cases,\ncovered by the track,” “there is not currently a risk of expo-\nsure.” Were this the only finding in the record, I would be\nhard pressed to see any rational connection between this find-\ning and the decision to include the Middle School track in the\nEPA’s removal action.\n\n   However, the record contains additional findings that sup-\nply a rational reason for removing the track. Specifically, the\nEPA found that “there was some amount of the [asbestos-\ncontaining] material readily exposed in high traffic areas” and\na risk of exposure to workers performing routine maintenance\non the track. Soil samples from the Middle School track also\nshow a 2-8% asbestos concentration at a depth of between 2\nand 24 inches in the soil surrounding the track. ER 388. Thus,\nafter a careful review of the record, I would conclude the EPA\nhas made a reasoned decision in including the Libby Middle\nSchool in its removal action and would allow recovery of\ncosts incurred there.\n\n  Thus, while I concur in the result of the majority’s decision,\nI write separately to emphasize that this court should stand\n\f15584        UNITED STATES v. W.R. GRACE & CO.\nready to review separately the EPA’s actions at different loca-\ntions at a removal site under the “arbitrary and capricious”\nstandard stated in 42 U.S.C. § 9613(j)(2).\n\f</pre>",
