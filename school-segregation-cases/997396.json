On June 23, 1987, the Director of the Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation issued Inconsistency Ruling IR-19, finding Nev. Admin. Code Secs. 705.310 through 705.370 to be inconsistent with the HMTA and, therefore, preempted.  PSC filed an appeal of IR-19 with the Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration, pursuant to 49 C.F.R. Sec. 107.211.

Tzung v.

Such regulations are \"inconsistent\" when (1) compliance with both the state or local regulation and the HMTA or DOT regulation is impossible, or (2) the state or local regulation is an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the HMTA or DOT regulation.  49 C.F.R. Sec. 107.209.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court held that the Nevada regulations were not inconsistent with the HMTA and HMR.  However, SPTC argues that the district court erred by failing to accord sufficient deference to the inconsistency ruling issued by the DOT.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOT found that its regulations and the Nevada regulations address many of the same matters.  For instance, it found that several of its own regulations already address storage incidental to the transportation of hazardous materials, the primary focus of the Nevada regulations.  Additionally, the Nevada regulations address other matters related to the transportation of hazardous materials.  Because the Nevada regulations address matters already covered by the federal regulations, impose substantial burdens on applicants, and create the risk of confusion, conflicts, and delays, the DOT determined that they were inconsistent with the federal regulations.  See DOT Research and Special Programs Administration, Inconsistency Ruling No. IR-19, Notice of Decision on Appeal, at p. 8 (April 1, 1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">However, the district court held that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>[t]he Nevada regulations deal primarily with the storage of hazardous materials on a railroad's property.  Contrary to the Advisory Opinion of the Department of Transportation, the federal regulations do not address in any significant manner storage of hazardous materials.  The federal regulations relied upon by the Department of Transportation to support its Advisory Opinion are not inconsistent with Nevada's regulations.  Compliance with the Nevada regulations, which require a single annual permit designating storage locations, does not in any manner prevent the railroad from complying with the federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Opinion of the Department of Transportation is poorly reasoned, based primarily on speculation as to what might or might not occur in connection with the processing of a permit to obtain approved storage facilities.  The Advisory Opinion is an attempt to suggest that the regulations of the Department of Transportation preempt the entire field of hazardous materials transportation.  As such, the Advisory Opinion directly conflicts with Section 1811 of the HMTA wherein Congress specifically recognized that the states were free to regulate provided that such state regulation is not inconsistent with federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DOT's inconsistency rulings are not binding on the courts.

Bayonne, 724 F.Supp. 320, 330 (D.N.J.1989) (emphasis added).  The court noted with approval the DOT's inconsistency ruling which found that these regulations constitute \"a comprehensive series of regulations relating to the storage of hazardous materials incidental to transportation by rail.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite DOT's extensive regulation of loading, unloading, transfer and storage incidental to the transportation of hazardous materials, the Nevada regulations require a carrier to obtain an annual permit prior to engaging in these activities within the state of Nevada.  The Nevada regulations, thus, create a separate regulatory regime for these activities, fostering confusion and frustrating Congress' goal of developing a uniform, national scheme of regulation.  The resulting confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the Nevada regulations only apply to some of the hazardous materials covered by the HMTA and HMR and not to others.  Compare 49 CFR Secs. 171.8 and 174.14(a) to Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.310.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal regulations also impose specific information and documentation requirements deemed necessary for the safe transportation of hazardous materials.  See e.g., 49 CFR Secs. 171.15 and .16.  The additional requirements imposed by the Nevada regulations are both redundant (see e.g., Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(f)) and burdensome (see e.g., Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(b) (requiring \"[a] report identifying each switch, siding, spur or branch of track at the site and its purpose)).  Further, they indicate the state's attempt to regulate areas clearly addressed in the federal regulations.  For example, despite the HMR's detailed requirements with respect to the loading and unloading of hazardous materials, the Nevada regulations require applicants to submit \"[a]n outline of the procedure to be used in the loading, unloading, transfer or storage of the hazardous material.\"    Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(g).  The PSC's approval of an application is apparently contingent upon its satisfaction with the procedures used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, although 49 CFR Secs. 174.16(a), (b) and 174.55(e) require that rail carriers store hazardous materials in a secure facility and Secs. 173.3 and 174.8 authorize the DOT to inspect storage sites for compliance, Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(h) requires applicants to submit an outline of its security measures.  Again, the PSC's approval of an application is apparently contingent upon its satisfaction with the precautions taken.  Under the open-ended Nevada regulations, the PSC could conceivably refuse an application based on its dissatisfaction with loading procedures or security measures adopted pursuant to the federal regulations and approved by federal inspectors.  Conversely, the PSC could conceivably approve a permit application despite the fact that loading procedures or security measures violate federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.370 authorizes the PSC to require an applicant to submit any additional information that it deems necessary may also lead to great expense and delay.  In fact, the Nevada regulations confer broad discretion upon the PSC.  Rather than establishing measurable standards, the regulations give the PSC the authority to approve or disapprove the procedures followed by a rail carrier.  At least one federal court has held similarly vague regulations invalid under the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  See Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. City of Las Vegas, CV-S-85-932 HDM (D.Nev., May 12, 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the DOT determined that the Nevada regulations, specifically sections 705.310, .320, .330, .340, .350, .360, and .370, constitute an obstacle to the execution of the HMTA and HMR and are, therefore, inconsistent under the \"obstacle test,\" the second leg of inconsistency analysis under the HMTA.  However, the district court based its holding upon its conclusion that \"[c]ompliance with the Nevada regulations ... does not in any manner prevent the railroad from complying with the federal regulations.\"    Thus, the district court determined that the Nevada regulations passed the \"dual compliance test,\" the first leg of the inconsistency analysis described above.  Although the DOT based its inconsistency ruling almost entirely upon its determination that the Nevada regulations failed the obstacle test, the district court not only failed to discuss the DOT's determination with respect to the obstacle test, it completely failed to acknowledge the existence of this second leg of preemption analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the DOT authored the HMR, its determination of what constitutes an obstacle to the accomplishment or execution of those regulations is deserving of substantial deference.  See Udall, 380 U.S. at 16, 85 S.Ct. at 801.    Contrary to the district court's holding, the DOT's inconsistency ruling is neither \"poorly reasoned\" nor \"based primarily on speculation.\"    The district court erred in failing to accord sufficient deference to this ruling.  Consequently, we reverse the district court's order and remand for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we hold that the Nevada regulations are preempted by HMTA and HMR, it is unnecessary for us to address the other arguments made by the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Additionally, the Nevada regulations address other matters related to the transportation of hazardous materials.  Because the Nevada regulations address matters already covered by the federal regulations, impose substantial burdens on applicants, and create the risk of confusion, conflicts, and delays, the DOT determined that they were inconsistent with the federal regulations.

The court noted with approval the DOT's inconsistency ruling which found that these regulations constitute \"a comprehensive series of regulations relating to the storage of hazardous materials incidental to transportation by rail.\"    Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite DOT's extensive regulation of loading, unloading, transfer and storage incidental to the transportation of hazardous materials, the Nevada regulations require a carrier to obtain an annual permit prior to engaging in these activities within the state of Nevada.  The Nevada regulations, thus, create a separate regulatory regime for these activities, fostering confusion and frustrating Congress' goal of developing a uniform, national scheme of regulation.  The resulting confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the Nevada regulations only apply to some of the hazardous materials covered by the HMTA and HMR and not to others.  Compare 49 CFR Secs. 171.8 and 174.14(a) to Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.310.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal regulations also impose specific information and documentation requirements deemed necessary for the safe transportation of hazardous materials.  See e.g., 49 CFR Secs. 171.15 and .16.  The additional requirements imposed by the Nevada regulations are both redundant (see e.g., Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(f)) and burdensome (see e.g., Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(b) (requiring \"[a] report identifying each switch, siding, spur or branch of track at the site and its purpose)).  Further, they indicate the state's attempt to regulate areas clearly addressed in the federal regulations.  For example, despite the HMR's detailed requirements with respect to the loading and unloading of hazardous materials, the Nevada regulations require applicants to submit \"[a]n outline of the procedure to be used in the loading, unloading, transfer or storage of the hazardous material.\"    Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(g).  The PSC's approval of an application is apparently contingent upon its satisfaction with the procedures used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, although 49 CFR Secs. 174.16(a), (b) and 174.55(e) require that rail carriers store hazardous materials in a secure facility and Secs. 173.3 and 174.8 authorize the DOT to inspect storage sites for compliance, Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.330(h) requires applicants to submit an outline of its security measures.  Again, the PSC's approval of an application is apparently contingent upon its satisfaction with the precautions taken.  Under the open-ended Nevada regulations, the PSC could conceivably refuse an application based on its dissatisfaction with loading procedures or security measures adopted pursuant to the federal regulations and approved by federal inspectors.  Conversely, the PSC could conceivably approve a permit application despite the fact that loading procedures or security measures violate federal regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the fact that Nev.Admin.Code Sec. 705.370 authorizes the PSC to require an applicant to submit any additional information that it deems necessary may also lead to great expense and delay.  In fact, the Nevada regulations confer broad discretion upon the PSC.  Rather than establishing measurable standards, the regulations give the PSC the authority to approve or disapprove the procedures followed by a rail carrier.  At least one federal court has held similarly vague regulations invalid under the Supremacy Clause, the Commerce Clause and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.  See Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. City of Las Vegas, CV-S-85-932 HDM (D.Nev., May 12, 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the DOT determined that the Nevada regulations, specifically sections 705.310, .320, .330, .340, .350, .360, and .370, constitute an obstacle to the execution of the HMTA and HMR and are, therefore, inconsistent under the \"obstacle test,\" the second leg of inconsistency analysis under the HMTA.  However, the district court based its holding upon its conclusion that \"[c]ompliance with the Nevada regulations ... does not in any manner prevent the railroad from complying with the federal regulations.\"    Thus, the district court determined that the Nevada regulations passed the \"dual compliance test,\" the first leg of the inconsistency analysis described above.  Although the DOT based its inconsistency ruling almost entirely upon its determination that the Nevada regulations failed the obstacle test, the district court not only failed to discuss the DOT's determination with respect to the obstacle test, it completely failed to acknowledge the existence of this second leg of preemption analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the DOT authored the HMR, its determination of what constitutes an obstacle to the accomplishment or execution of those regulations is deserving of substantial deference.  See Udall, 380 U.S. at 16, 85 S.Ct. at 801.    Contrary to the district court's holding, the DOT's inconsistency ruling is neither \"poorly reasoned\" nor \"based primarily on speculation.\"    The district court erred in failing to accord sufficient deference to this ruling.  Consequently, we reverse the district court's order and remand for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we hold that the Nevada regulations are preempted by HMTA and HMR, it is unnecessary for us to address the other arguments made by the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
