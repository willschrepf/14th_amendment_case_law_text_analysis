Richard Villarreal\n\nsued R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Pinstripe, Inc. for rejecting his job\n\napplications. All parties agree that Villarreal, as an applicant for employment, can\n\nsue for disparate treatment because the Act prohibits an employer from “fail[ing]\n\nor refus[ing] to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.” 29\n\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(1). But Villarreal and the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission, as amicus curiae, argue that an applicant can also sue an employer\n\nfor disparate impact because the Act prohibits an employer from “limit[ing],\n\nsegregat[ing], or classify[ing] his employees in any way which would deprive or\n\ntend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\n\naffect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” Id. § 623(a)(2).\n\nWe conclude that the whole text of the Act makes clear that an applicant for\n\nemployment cannot sue an employer for disparate impact because the applicant has\n\nno “status as an employee.” Id. And we conclude that Villarreal is not entitled to\n\nequitable tolling of his claim of disparate treatment because he admitted facts that\n\nestablish that he did not diligently pursue his rights. We affirm in part and remand\n\nfor the panel to address the remaining issue about whether the continuing-violation\n\ndoctrine makes Villarreal’s claim of disparate treatment timely.\n\n                                            2\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 3 of 76\n\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n      On November 8, 2007, Villarreal applied for a position as a territory\n\nmanager at R.J. Reynolds. He was 49 years old. Using guidelines provided by R.J.\n\nReynolds, a contractor screened out Villarreal’s application. The guidelines\n\ndescribed the “targeted candidate” as someone “2–3 years out of college” who\n\n“adjusts easily to changes” and instructed the contractor to “stay away from”\n\napplicants “in sales for 8–10 years.” Neither the contractor nor R.J. Reynolds told\n\nVillarreal that he had been rejected, and Villarreal did not follow up.\n\n      Over two years later, in April 2010, lawyers contacted Villarreal and told\n\nhim that R.J. Reynolds had discriminated against him on the basis of his age. In\n\nMay 2010, Villarreal filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission. Villarreal also applied to R.J. Reynolds five more times in the next\n\ntwo years and was rejected every time. He amended his charge to include these\n\nrejections and to add Pinstripe, which replaced the first contractor, as a respondent.\n\n      In April 2012, the Commission issued notices of right to sue with respect to\n\nR.J. Reynolds and Pinstripe. Villarreal brought a collective action against R.J.\n\nReynolds and Pinstripe under the Act on behalf of “all applicants for the Territory\n\nManager position who applied for the position since the date RJ Reynolds began its\n\npattern or practice of discriminating against applicants over the age of 40 . . . ; who\n\nwere 40 years of age or older at the time of their application; and who were\n\n\n                                           3\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 4 of 76\n\n\nrejected for the position.” The complaint alleged two counts: disparate treatment\n\nunder section 4(a)(1) of the Act and disparate impact under section 4(a)(2) of the\n\nAct.\n\n       In anticipation of an objection of untimeliness, Villarreal also alleged facts\n\nto support equitable tolling of the limitations period that governed his complaint.\n\nHe alleged that “he did not become aware until shortly before filing the charge that\n\nthere was reason to believe that his 2007 application for the Territory Manager\n\nposition had been rejected on account of his age.” He also alleged that “[t]he facts\n\nnecessary to support [his] charge of discrimination were not apparent to him, and\n\ncould not have been apparent to him, until less than a month before he filed his\n\nMay 17, 2010 EEOC charge.”\n\n       R.J. Reynolds and Pinstripe moved to dismiss Villarreal’s complaint in part.\n\nThey moved to dismiss the disparate-impact count on the ground that section\n\n4(a)(2) does not give a cause of action to applicants, and they moved to dismiss as\n\nuntimely the parts of both counts based on the 2007 application. The district court\n\ndismissed the disparate-impact count and the untimely parts of both counts.\n\n       When Villarreal later moved for leave to amend the complaint, he alleged in\n\nhis proposed amended complaint that he “was not an employee of . . . R.J.\n\nReynolds . . . or related to anyone who was,” that he “did not receive any\n\ncommunication from RJ Reynolds or anyone else informing him why he was not\n\n                                           4\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 5 of 76\n\n\nhired,” that he “did not even know whether his application had been reviewed at\n\nall,” and that he was unaware of the screening guidelines. The district court denied\n\nleave to amend the complaint on the ground that amendment would be futile. It\n\nexplained that Villarreal “has not alleged any misrepresentations or concealment\n\nthat hindered [him] from learning of any alleged discrimination,” that he “made no\n\nattempt to contact [R.J. Reynolds] and ascertain the basis for his application\n\nrejection,” and that he “has not alleged any due diligence on his part.” Villarreal\n\nlater moved to dismiss the remaining parts of the complaint, and the district court\n\ndismissed them with prejudice.\n\n      A divided panel of this Court reversed. Villarreal v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\n\nCo., 806 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir. 2015), reh’g en banc granted, opinion\n\nvacated, No. 15-10602 (11th Cir. Feb. 10, 2016). It concluded that section 4(a)(2)\n\nwas ambiguous and deferred to the interpretation of the Commission announced in\n\na rule. Id. It also concluded that equitable tolling was appropriate. Id. The panel did\n\nnot address the continuing-violation doctrine, which Villarreal also raised in\n\nsupport of the timeliness of his claims. Id. at 1306 n.16. Judge Vinson, sitting by\n\ndesignation, dissented. Id. at 1306.\n\n                          II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n      “We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim,\n\naccepting all allegations in the complaint as true and construing facts in the light\n\n\n                                           5\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 6 of 76\n\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiff.” Harry v. Marchant, 291 F.3d 767, 769 (11th Cir.\n\n2002) (en banc). “We review the denial of a motion to amend for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, but whether the motion is futile is a question of law that we review de\n\nnovo.” Brooks v. Warden, 800 F.3d 1295, 1300 (11th Cir. 2015).\n\n                                 III. DISCUSSION\n\n      We divide our discussion in two parts. First, we explain that Villarreal failed\n\nto state a claim under section 4(a)(2) because he was a job applicant, not an\n\nemployee of R.J. Reynolds. Second, we explain that Villarreal is not entitled to\n\nequitable tolling because he admits facts that disprove diligence.\n\n            A. Villarreal Failed to State a Claim Under Section 4(a)(2).\n      Section 4(a)(2) of the Act makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 623(a)(2). We consider not only the text of section 4(a)(2) itself, but also the\n\nstatutory context in sections 4(c)(2) and 4(a)(1). See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.\n\nGarner, Reading Law 167 (2012) (“The text must be construed as a whole.”); id. at\n\n170 (“A word or phrase is presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text; a\n\nmaterial variation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.”); Robinson v. Shell\n\nOil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997) (“The plainness or ambiguity of statutory\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016     Page: 7 of 76\n\n\nlanguage is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in\n\nwhich that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.”);\n\nMorrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Dir., Office of Workers’ Comp. Programs, U.S.\n\nDep’t of Labor, 461 U.S. 624, 633 (1983) (“[W]e have often stated that a word is\n\npresumed to have the same meaning in all subsections of the same statute.”). If the\n\ntext of the statute is clear, “that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the\n\nagency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”\n\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842–43 (1984).\n\n       We conclude that Villarreal failed to state a claim of disparate impact. The\n\nplain text of section 4(a)(2) covers discrimination against employees. It does not\n\ncover applicants for employment.\n\n       The key phrase in section 4(a)(2) is “or otherwise adversely affect his status\n\nas an employee.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). By using “or otherwise” to join the verbs\n\nin this section, Congress made “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual\n\nof employment opportunities” a subset of “adversely affect[ing] [the individual’s]\n\nstatus as an employee.” Id. In other words, section 4(a)(2) protects an individual\n\nonly if he has a “status as an employee.” Id.\n\n       This use of “or otherwise” to connect verbs is a familiar construction. For\n\nexample, Congress allows the use of funds to extradite a United States citizen “to a\n\nforeign country that is under an obligation to surrender persons to the International\n\n                                             7\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 8 of 76\n\n\nCriminal Court” if there are “satisfactory assurances to the United States that the\n\ncountry will not extradite or otherwise transfer that citizen to the International\n\nCriminal Court.” 22 U.S.C. § 7402(a). As we understand that “extradite” is a\n\nsubset of “transfer” in this statute, we also understand that “deprive or tend to\n\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities” is a subset of “adversely\n\naffect his status as an employee” in section 4(a)(2). Other examples abound. See,\n\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2345(b) (“inhibit or otherwise affect”); 25 U.S.C. § 1728(c)\n\n(“considered as income or resources or otherwise utilized”); 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1518(a)(3) (“call at or otherwise utilize a deepwater port”). Even our own\n\nprocedural rules use this construction. For example, a single judge of our Court\n\n“may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding.” Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 27(c); see also 11th Cir. R. 27-1(d) (same); 11th Cir. R. 41-1(a) (“shows\n\nthat a substantial question is to be presented to the Supreme Court or otherwise sets\n\nforth good cause for a stay”); 11th Cir. R. 42-1(b) (“fails to file a brief or other\n\nrequired papers within the time permitted, or otherwise fails to comply with the\n\napplicable rules” and “file documents out of time or otherwise remedy the\n\ndefault”). In each of these examples, the first action is a subset of the second\n\naction. So too is “deprive or tend to deprive” a subset of “adversely affect” in\n\nsection 4(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 9 of 76\n\n\n      Villarreal cites a contrary interpretation of the phrase “or otherwise” in Rine\n\nv. Imagitas, Inc., 590 F.3d 1215 (11th Cir. 2009), but we reject the reasoning in\n\nthat opinion. The statute at issue in Rine made it unlawful to “knowingly disclose\n\nor otherwise make available” certain personal information. 18 U.S.C. § 2721(a).\n\nThe panel wrote that the use of the disjunctive “or” “indicates alternatives and\n\nrequires that those alternatives be treated separately.” Rine, 590 F.3d at 1224\n\n(quoting Brown v. Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 119 F.3d 922, 924 (11th Cir.\n\n1997)). The panel also wrote that “Congress’s use of ‘otherwise’ confirms that\n\n‘make available’ means something different than, or unlike, disclosure.” Id. But the\n\npanel—and the authorities it cited—discussed “or” and “otherwise” in isolation.\n\nWords can acquire different meanings when combined in a phrase, and the phrase\n\n“or otherwise” is different from the sum of its parts.\n\n      In her dissent, Judge Martin contends that our reading of the phrase “or\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee” renders superfluous the\n\nphrase “deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities,”\n\nDissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 5–6, but the surplusage canon does not apply in this\n\ncontext. The phrase “or otherwise” operates as a catchall: the specific items that\n\nprecede it are meant to be subsumed by what comes after the “or otherwise.” See\n\nBegay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 153 (2008) (Scalia, J., concurring in the\n\njudgment) (“[T]he canon against surplusage has substantially less force when it\n\n                                          9\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 10 of 76\n\n\ncomes to interpreting a broad residual clause . . . .”). This construction allows the\n\ndrafter to “add specificity about known dangers” while ensuring that “other\n\n[dangers], not readily imagined, [are] also encompassed.” United States v.\n\nPersichilli, 608 F.3d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 2010). In any event, the surplusage canon\n\napplies “only where a competing interpretation gives effect ‘to every clause and\n\nword of a statute.’” Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. P’ship, 564 U.S. 91, 106 (2011)\n\n(quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001)). Judge Martin’s\n\ninterpretation, which treats “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n\nemployee” and “deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” as separate categories, does not give effect to every word because it\n\nreads “otherwise” out of the statute.\n\n      By making “deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” a subset of “adversely affect[ing] his status as an employee,”\n\nCongress limited section 4(a)(2) to discrimination against employees. Applicants\n\nwho are not employees when alleged discrimination occurs do not have a “status as\n\nan employee.” Dictionaries confirm that the phrase “status as an employee”\n\nconnotes a present fact. The Oxford English Dictionary primarily defines “status”\n\nin the legal context to mean “[t]he fact or position of belonging to a group which is\n\nsubject to certain legal rights or limitations,” and it provides usage notes ranging\n\nfrom 1767 to 2002. Status, Oxford English Dictionary (online ed.) (emphasis\n\n                                          10\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 11 of 76\n\n\nadded) (all Internet materials as visited June 30, 2016, and available in Clerk of\n\nCourt’s case file). Other dictionaries have similar definitions. See Status, A\n\nDictionary of Modern Legal Usage 828 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 2d ed. 1995)\n\n(“belonging to a particular class of persons to all of whom the law assigns\n\nparticular legal powers, capacities, liabilities or incapacities” (emphasis added)\n\n(quoting 1 David M. Walker, Principles of Scottish Private Law 198 (3d ed.\n\n1982))); Status, Black’s Law Dictionary 1264 (Special Deluxe 5th ed. 1979)\n\n(“[s]tanding; state or condition; social position” (emphasis added)); Status,\n\nWebster’s New International Dictionary 2463 (2d ed. 1961) (defining “status” in\n\nthe legal context as “[t]he condition of a person by which the nature of his legal\n\npersonality and his legal capacities are determined, and therefore the nature of the\n\nlegal relations to the state or to other persons into which he may enter” (emphasis\n\nadded)).The meaning of “as” also confirms that “his status as an employee” refers\n\nto a present fact. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “as” in the relevant sense\n\nto mean “[i]n the character, capacity, or function of.” As, Oxford English\n\nDictionary (online ed.).\n\n      Judge Martin’s dissent stresses the breadth of the words “any individual,”\n\nsee Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 4–5, 8–9, but the dissent reads those words in\n\nisolation. “[E]ven though the word ‘any’ demands a broad interpretation, we must\n\nlook beyond that word itself” to determine its ultimate scope. Small v. United\n\n                                          11\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 12 of 76\n\n\nStates, 544 U.S. 385, 388 (2005); see also United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511\n\nU.S. 350, 357 (1994) (“[R]espondent errs in placing dispositive weight on the\n\nbroad statutory reference to ‘any’ law enforcement officer or agency without\n\nconsidering the rest of the statute.”); United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. 610, 631\n\n(1818) (Marshall, C.J.) (“The words ‘any person or persons,’ are broad enough to\n\ncomprehend every human being. But general words must . . . be limited . . . to\n\nthose objects to which the legislature intended to apply them.”). The words “any\n\nindividual” in section 4(a)(2) are limited by the phrase “or otherwise affect his\n\nstatus as an employee,” so the “individuals” that the statute covers are those with a\n\n“status as an employee.” Judge Martin’s dissent says “‘any individual’ means ‘any\n\nindividual,’” Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 8, but the whole text makes clear that\n\n“any individual” with a “status as an employee” means “any employee.”\n\n      Judge Martin’s dissent also contends that someone can have a “status as an\n\nemployee” without being an employee, see id. at 6–7, but we disagree. Judge\n\nMartin’s dissent cites the Dictionary Act for the proposition that “words used in the\n\npresent tense include the future as well as the present,” id. at 6 (quoting 1 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1), but the word “status” is a noun, not a verb. Nouns do not have “tense.” See\n\nBryan A. Garner, Tense, The Chicago Guide to Grammar, Usage, and Punctuation\n\n480 (2016) (“A verb quality that expresses the time of action—past, present, or\n\nfuture.” (emphasis added)); Bryan A. Garner, Tense, Garner’s Modern American\n\n                                          12\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 13 of 76\n\n\nUsage 920 (3d ed. 2009) (“A verb’s quality that shows the time in which an act,\n\nstate, or condition occurs or occurred; the correspondence between a verb form and\n\nthe concept of time.” (emphases added)); Carr v. United States, 560 U.S. 438, 448\n\n(2010) (explaining that section 1 of the Dictionary Act “ascribes significance to\n\nverb tense” (emphasis added)). We know that “status” connotes a present fact in\n\nsection 4(a)(2) based on the plain meaning of the phrase “his status as an\n\nemployee,” not based on any “tense.”\n\n      Judge Martin’s dissent also cites judicial opinions that use the word “status”\n\nafter an adjectival noun—“priority status,” “seaman status,” “objector status,”\n\netc.—to prove that status does not always connote a present fact. See Dissenting\n\nOp. of Martin, J., at 7 n.2. But even if we were to assume that snippets from\n\njudicial opinions can shed meaningful light on the meaning of a statute, cf. United\n\nStates v. Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, 235 F.3d 429, 433 (9th Cir. 2000) (“Opinions,\n\nunlike statutes, are not usually written with the knowledge or expectation that each\n\nand every word may be the subject of searching analysis.”), the examples provided\n\nby Judge Martin’s dissent do not track the language of section 4(a)(2). The dissent\n\nmight have a point if section 4(a)(2) applied to anyone who was “denied employee\n\nstatus”; but the statute instead applies to anyone who had “his status as an\n\nemployee” adversely affected. The only examples in Judge Martin’s dissent that\n\ncome close to the actual language in the statute do not state that someone who\n\n                                         13\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016      Page: 14 of 76\n\n\napplies for a status has that status during the application process. For example, the\n\ndissent cites Santos v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 375 F.2d 262 (9th\n\nCir. 1967), because that decision states that an alien can be “‘denied status as a\n\npermanent resident.’” Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 7 (quoting Santos, at 264\n\nn.1). But Santos states that an alien can attain status as a permanent resident only\n\nafter undergoing an application process, not that he had that status during the\n\napplication process. See Santos, 375 F.2d at 263 (noting an alien can apply for\n\n“adjustment of status from non-immigrant to permanent resident”).\n\n      Statutory context confirms our reading of section 4(a)(2). Section 4(c)(2)\n\napplies to applicants as well as employees only because it adds the words “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” to a provision that is otherwise largely parallel to\n\nsection 4(a)(2):\n\n      It shall be unlawful for a labor organization . . .\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify its membership, or to classify or\n             fail or refuse to refer for employment any individual, in any\n             way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n             employment opportunities, or would limit such employment\n             opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n             employee or as an applicant for employment, because of such\n             individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(c) (emphasis added). Because “[i]f possible, every word and every\n\nprovision is to be given effect” and “[n]one should needlessly be given an\n\ninterpretation that causes it to duplicate another provision or to have no\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 15 of 76\n\n\nconsequence,” Scalia & Garner, supra, at 174, we know that the term “employee”\n\ndoes not encompass “applicant for employment” in section 4(c)(2). And because\n\n“[a] word or phrase is presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text” and\n\n“a material variation in terms suggests a variation in meaning,” id. at 170, the term\n\n“employee” and the phrase “deprive or tend to deprive any individual . . . or\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee” in section 4(a)(2) do not\n\nencompass an applicant for employment.\n\n      In her dissent, Judge Martin responds that section 4(c)(2) mentions\n\napplicants because it, unlike section 4(a)(2), covers failures to “refer” someone for\n\nemployment, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 10–12, but this argument does not\n\nline up with Judge Martin’s interpretation of section 4(a)(2). If “any individual”\n\nalways includes applicants, see id. at 8–9, and applicants can have their “status as\n\nan employee” adversely affected, see id. at 5–7, then Congress had no need to\n\nmention applicants in section 4(c)(2). The statute would mean the exact same\n\nthing, under Judge Martin’s interpretation, if the words “or as an applicant for\n\nemployment” were deleted. But that interpretation violates the surplusage canon.\n\nSee Scalia & Garner, supra, at 174.\n\n      We also contrast the text of section 4(a)(2) with the text of section 4(a)(1),\n\nwhich does cover applicants. Section 4(a)(1) makes it unlawful for employers “to\n\nfail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\n                                         15\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 16 of 76\n\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). Unlike section 4(a)(1), section 4(a)(2) does not\n\nmention an employer refusing to hire someone. And unlike section 4(a)(2), section\n\n4(a)(1) says nothing about a “status as an employee.”\n\n      According to Judge Martin’s dissent, a plurality of the Supreme Court has\n\ndescribed “the ‘key textual differences’ between” sections 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2) and,\n\nin so doing, said nothing about claims of disparate impact in hiring, Dissenting Op.\n\nof Martin, J., at 16 (quoting Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 236 n.6\n\n(2005) (plurality op.)), but the plurality did not say that these “key textual\n\ndifferences” were the only differences between these two sections. See Smith, 544\n\nU.S. at 236 n.6 (plurality op.) (“JUSTICE O’CONNOR ignores key textual differences\n\nbetween § 4(a)(1) . . . and § 4(a)(2).”). Indeed, in the very same paragraph, the\n\nplurality described section 4(a)(2) as a provision that covers employees. See id.\n\n(“[A]n employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be\n\nliable under the terms of [section 4(a)(2)] if such classification adversely affects\n\nthe employee because of that employee’s age . . . .” (emphases added)).\n\n      Villarreal argues, based on a different section of the Act, that “employee” in\n\nsection 4(a)(2) means something other than employee, but his argument fails.\n\nSection 7(c)(1) creates a cause of action for “[a]ny person aggrieved” and provides\n\n                                           16\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 17 of 76\n\n\nthat the right of action “shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce the right of such\n\nemployee under this chapter.” Id. § 626(c)(1) (emphasis added). Villarreal asserts\n\nthat by equating “person” and “employee” in section 7(c)(1), Congress expanded\n\n“employee” to mean “any individual” in section 4(a)(2). But the statute defines\n\n“employee” as “an individual employed by any employer,” id. § 630(f), which is\n\nalso the common meaning of “employee.” “It is very rare that a defined meaning\n\ncan be replaced with another permissible meaning of the word on the basis of other\n\ntextual indications; the definition is virtually conclusive.” Scalia & Garner, supra,\n\nat 228. Section 7(c)(1) does not create ambiguity about the meaning of “employee”\n\nin section 4(a)(2).\n\n      Villarreal’s other arguments that “employee” does not mean employee are\n\neven easier to reject. Villarreal cites Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., which held that a\n\nprohibition on retaliation against employees in Title VII extended to former\n\nemployees because of statutory context. See 519 U.S. at 345–46. But the Supreme\n\nCourt did not interpret employee to mean job applicant in Robinson, and the\n\nstatutory context in this appeal—specifically, sections 4(c)(2) and 4(a)(1)—\n\nsuggests that they are different. Judge Martin’s dissenting opinion adds that the\n\ndefinition of “employment agency” in Title VII uses “employees” to mean\n\n“prospective employees,” Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 7–8 (quoting Robinson,\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 18 of 76\n\n\n519 U.S. at 343 n.3), but the language of that provision is nothing like the language\n\nin section 4(a)(2), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c) (defining “employment agency” as\n\n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure\n\nemployees for an employer or to procure for employees opportunities to work for\n\nan employer and includes an agent of such a person”). Villarreal also cites section\n\n201 of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, id.\n\n§ 2000ff(2)(A)(i), which defines “employee” to include “applicant.” But the\n\napplicable definition in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not\n\ninclude “applicant.” See 29 U.S.C. § 630(f).\n\n      Villarreal tries to circumvent the plain meaning of the statute by citing\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court that interpret similar language in other statutes, but\n\nthose decisions do not support his argument. Villarreal argues that, in Texas\n\nDepartment of Housing & Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project,\n\nInc., 135 S. Ct. 2507 (2015), the Supreme Court interpreted “otherwise make\n\nunavailable” in the Fair Housing Act and compared it to the phrase “otherwise\n\nadversely affect” in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Id. at 2519. The\n\nSupreme Court described both phrases as “catchall.” Id. The use of the word\n\n“catchall” by the Supreme Court is agnostic about the present matter because the\n\nCourt used the word to explain why the Housing Act creates a cause of action for\n\ndisparate impact. Id. The Supreme Court has already held that section 4(a)(2) of\n\n                                         18\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 19 of 76\n\n\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act allows employees to allege disparate\n\nimpact, see Smith, 544 U.S. 228, and the Court shed no light in Inclusive\n\nCommunities Project on whether a job applicant may sue under section 4(a)(2).\n\n      Villarreal and Judge Martin’s dissent argue that, in Griggs v. Duke Power\n\nCo., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), the Supreme Court interpreted then-identical language in\n\nTitle VII to encompass applicants, see Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 12–15, but\n\nGriggs does not support their argument. The plaintiffs in Griggs were employees,\n\nsee Griggs, 401 U.S. at 426 (“All the petitioners are employed at the Company[]\n\n. . . .”), and the opinion nowhere states that a non-employee applying for a job\n\nwould be covered by the language in Title VII. The only “condition of\n\nemployment” that the Supreme Court considered in Griggs was “a condition of\n\nemployment in or transfer to jobs”—that is, a condition that employees graduate\n\nhigh school or pass a test before they could be promoted or transferred to a new\n\nposition. Griggs, 401 U.S. 425–26 (emphasis added). Lest there be any doubt, on\n\nremand the district court entered an injunction in favor of present and future\n\nemployees, not applicants “who may hereafter seek employment.” See Griggs v.\n\nDuke Power Co., No. C-210-G-66, 1972 WL 215, at *1 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 25, 1972)\n\n(defining “[t]he class of persons entitled to relief under this Order” as “[a]ll black\n\npersons employed” or “who may subsequently be employed”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 20 of 76\n\n\n      Villarreal and Judge Martin’s dissent contend that the Supreme Court has\n\nsince described Griggs as a case about applicants, but they are incorrect. Villarreal\n\nquotes language about applicants and Griggs from Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S.\n\n321, 329 (1977), but because the Supreme Court decided Dothard after Congress\n\nadded language about applicants to Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2)\n\n(“employees or applicants for employment”), we do not consider this dicta\n\nsignificant. Judge Martin’s dissent quotes language about “hiring criteria” and\n\nGriggs from Inclusive Communities Project. Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 1, 13–\n\n14 (quoting Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at 2517). But the Supreme Court\n\nwas discussing how the “rule” announced in Griggs—that “employment practices”\n\nare permissible if they have a “‘manifest relationship’ to job performance”—would\n\napply, “for example,” “in a disparate-impact case” brought by an applicant under\n\nTitle VII as it is written today. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at 2517\n\n(quoting Griggs, 401 U.S. at 432). The Supreme Court did not say that Griggs—a\n\ncase that was clearly about promotion and transfer policies—involved “hiring\n\ncriteria” for first-time applicants. See also Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 446\n\n(1982) (describing Griggs as a case about “employees”); Albemarle Paper Co. v.\n\nMoody, 422 U.S. 405, 426 (1975) (describing Griggs as a case about\n\n“transferees”); Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642, 664 (1989)\n\n(Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting)\n\n                                          20\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016     Page: 21 of 76\n\n\n(describing Griggs as a case “in which a class of utility company employees\n\nchallenged the conditioning of entry into higher paying jobs upon a high school\n\neducation or passage of two written tests” (emphasis added)). Indeed, nine current\n\nor former Justices have written or joined opinions describing section 4(a)(2) as\n\nprotecting employees, not applicants. See Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab.,\n\n554 U.S. 84, 96 n.13 (2008) (explaining that the statute prohibits acts that “deprive\n\nor tend to deprive . . . or otherwise adversely affect [employees] . . . because of . . .\n\nage” (alterations in original) (quoting 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2)); Smith, 544 U.S. at\n\n236 (plurality opinion) (“[T]he text focuses on the effects of the action on the\n\nemployee rather than the motivation for the action of the employer.”); id. at 266\n\n(O’Connor, J., joined by Kennedy and Thomas, JJ., concurring in the judgment)\n\n(“Section 4(a)(2), of course, does not apply to ‘applicants for employment’ at all—\n\nit is only § 4(a)(1) that protects this group.”). Villarreal and the Commission next\n\nargue about the meaning of the parallel provision in Title VII based on legislative\n\nhistory, but we do not consider legislative history when the text is clear. “[I]n\n\ninterpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before\n\nothers. We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature\n\nsays in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.” Conn.\n\nNat’l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253–54 (1992). “When the words of a\n\nstatute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: ‘judicial inquiry is\n\n                                           21\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 22 of 76\n\n\ncomplete.’” Id. at 254 (quoting Rubin v. United States, 449 U.S. 424, 430 (1981));\n\naccord Harris v. Garner, 216 F.3d 970, 976 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). “Even if a\n\nstatute’s legislative history evinces an intent contrary to its straightforward\n\nstatutory command, ‘we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text\n\nthat is clear.’” Harry, 291 F.3d at 772 (quoting Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S.\n\n135, 147–48 (1994)). To the extent we previously have ruled or suggested\n\ndifferently, we now disavow it. Because the text is clear, “[w]e will, as we must,\n\n‘presume that Congress said what it meant and meant what it said.’” Davidson v.\n\nCapital One Bank (USA), N.A., 797 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Steele, 147 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir. 1998) (en banc)).\n\n      Villarreal and the Commission also contend that the purpose of the Act\n\nrequires us to ignore the plain text, but “[o]ur job is to follow the text even if doing\n\nso will supposedly ‘undercut a basic objective of the statute,’” Baker Botts L.L.P.\n\nv. ASARCO LLC, 135 S. Ct. 2158, 2169 (2015) (quoting Baker Botts, 135 S. Ct. at\n\n2170 (Breyer, J., dissenting)). Elevating general notions of purpose over the plain\n\nmeaning of the text is inconsistent with our judicial duty to interpret the law as\n\nwritten. See Pavelic & LeFlore v. Marvel Entm’t Grp., 493 U.S. 120, 126 (1989)\n\n(“Our task is to apply the text, not to improve upon it.”); Ali v. Fed. Bureau of\n\nPrisons, 552 U.S. 214, 228 (2008) (“We are not at liberty to rewrite the statute to\n\nreflect a meaning we deem more desirable. Instead, we must give effect to the text\n\n                                           22\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 23 of 76\n\n\nCongress enacted . . . .”); Noble State Bank v. Haskell, 219 U.S. 575, 580 (1911)\n\n(“We fully understand the practical importance of the question, and the very\n\npowerful argument that can be made against the wisdom of the legislation, but on\n\nthat point we have nothing to say, as it is not our concern.”). It also disregards “the\n\nprocesses of [legislative] compromise and, in the end, prevents the effectuation of\n\ncongressional intent.” Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve Sys. v. Dimension Fin.\n\nCorp., 474 U.S. 361, 374 (1986). “Congress may be unanimous in its intent to\n\nstamp out some vague social or economic evil,” but “because its Members may\n\ndiffer sharply on the means for effectuating that intent, the final language of the\n\nlegislation may reflect hard-fought compromises.” Id.\n\n      Finally, Villarreal and the Commission urge us to defer to the Commission’s\n\ninterpretation of the statute, but we do not defer to an agency’s interpretation of a\n\nstatute when the text is clear. “Statutory language is ambiguous if it is susceptible\n\nto more than one reasonable interpretation,” Med. Transp. Mgmt. Corp. v. Comm’r\n\nof IRS, 506 F.3d 1364, 1368 (11th Cir. 2007), and a forced meaning does not create\n\nambiguity. Because “[t]he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory\n\nconstruction,” we must first “employ[] [the] traditional tools of statutory\n\nconstruction” to determine whether the meaning of the statute is clear. Chevron,\n\n467 U.S. at 843 n.9. Although employing the traditional tools of statutory\n\nconstruction may require some effort, that effort does not make a text ambiguous.\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 24 of 76\n\n\nSee Wagner Seed Co. v. Bush, 946 F.2d 918, 924 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We have\n\nemployed the traditional tools of statutory interpretation here, and we conclude that\n\nthe only reasonable meaning of the statute is that a job applicant cannot sue under\n\nsection 4(a)(2).\n\n      Congress did not leave applicants without recourse. Section 4(a)(1) provides\n\nthem with a cause of action for disparate treatment. See 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1). To\n\nprove this cause of action using the burden-shifting framework of McDonnell\n\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), statistics about an employer’s\n\npractice “may be relevant to any showing of pretext.” Id. at 804–05. If an applicant\n\nforegoes the burden-shifting framework and instead “presents circumstantial\n\nevidence [to] create[] a triable issue concerning the employer’s discriminatory\n\nintent,” Smith v. Lockheed-Martin Corp., 644 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir. 2011),\n\ngeneral evidence of a discriminatory practice also may be relevant in proving his\n\ncase. But Villarreal voluntarily dismissed his timely claims of disparate treatment.\n\nAs to his claim of disparate impact, we conclude that he failed to state a claim\n\nunder section 4(a)(2) because the text protects employees, not applicants.\n\n           B. Villarreal Admits Facts That Foreclose Equitable Tolling.\n      Villarreal argues that he alleged facts that would entitle him to equitable\n\ntolling of his remaining claim of disparate treatment. The party seeking equitable\n\ntolling has the burden of proof, Menominee Indian Tribe of Wis. v. United States,\n\n\n                                         24\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 25 of 76\n\n\n136 S. Ct. 750, 755–56 (2016), although he need not make any allegations about\n\nequitable tolling in his complaint, see LaGrasta v. First Union Sec., Inc., 358 F.3d\n\n840, 845 (11th Cir. 2004). A plaintiff nonetheless can plead himself out of court by\n\nalleging facts that foreclose a finding of diligence or extraordinary circumstances,\n\nboth of which are required for equitable tolling, see Menominee Indian Tribe, 136\n\nS. Ct. at 755–56. Villarreal did so here by alleging facts that prevent him from\n\nproving diligence.\n\n      The general test for equitable tolling requires the party seeking tolling to\n\nprove “(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some\n\nextraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.” Id. at\n\n755 (quoting Holland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 649 (2010)). Although the\n\nSupreme Court has stopped short of holding that this test applies in all contexts,\n\nsee id. at 756 n.2, we have applied it in a variety of contexts, see, e.g., Bhd. of\n\nLocomotive Eng’rs & Trainmen Gen. Comm. of Adjustment CSX Transp. N. Lines\n\nv. CSX Transp., Inc., 522 F.3d 1190, 1197, 1200 (11th Cir. 2008) (Railway Labor\n\nAct); Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, 402 F.3d 1148, 1154–55 (11th Cir. 2005)\n\n(Torture Victim Protection Act); Sandvik v. United States, 177 F.3d 1269, 1271\n\n(11th Cir. 1999) (Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act); see also Jackson\n\nv. Astrue, 506 F.3d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir. 2007) (requiring extraordinary\n\ncircumstances in an action under the Social Security Act); Justice v. United States,\n\n                                           25\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016     Page: 26 of 76\n\n\n6 F.3d 1474, 1479 (11th Cir. 1993) (requiring due diligence in an action under the\n\nPublic Vessels Act and the Suits in Admiralty Act). R.J. Reynolds argues that this\n\ngeneral test applies, but Villarreal argues for a special test.\n\n      We hold that the general test applies. We reject a special test because the\n\n“[p]rocedural requirements established by Congress for gaining access to the\n\nfederal courts are not to be disregarded by courts out of a vague sympathy for\n\nparticular litigants.” Baldwin Cty. Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 152\n\n(1984). “[I]n the long run, experience teaches that strict adherence to the\n\nprocedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of\n\nevenhanded administration of the law.” Id. (quoting Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447\n\nU.S. 807, 826 (1980)). In the antidiscrimination context, “[b]y choosing what are\n\nobviously quite short deadlines, Congress clearly intended to encourage the prompt\n\nprocessing of all charges of employment discrimination.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger\n\nCorp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 109 (2002) (alteration in original) (quoting\n\nMohasco Corp., 447 U.S. at 825). “[T]he costs associated with processing and\n\ndefending stale or dormant claims outweigh the federal interest in guaranteeing a\n\nremedy to every victim of discrimination.” Mohasco Corp., 447 U.S. at 820. For\n\nthese reasons, “[f]ederal courts have typically extended equitable relief only\n\nsparingly,” Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990), and\n\nrequiring proof of diligence and extraordinary circumstances serves these goals.\n\n                                           26\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 27 of 76\n\n\n      We also observe that other circuits have applied this general test or a\n\nmaterially similar one in discrimination cases. See Dyson v. Dist. of Columbia, 710\n\nF.3d 415, 421 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Zerilli-Edelglass v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 333 F.3d\n\n74, 80–81 (2d Cir. 2003); Lee v. Cook County, 635 F.3d 969, 972 (7th Cir. 2011).\n\nThe Sixth Circuit considers diligence, the reasonableness of ignorance, lack of\n\nnotice, lack of constructive knowledge, and prejudice to the defendant. See Amini\n\nv. Oberlin Coll., 259 F.3d 493, 500 (6th Cir. 2001). The Eighth Circuit denies\n\nequitable tolling when the plaintiff’s neglect is inexcusable. See Anderson v.\n\nUnisys Corp., 47 F.3d 302, 306–07 (8th Cir. 1995). The Ninth Circuit considers\n\ndiligence and limits equitable tolling to “extreme cases.” See Scholar v. Pac. Bell,\n\n963 F.2d 264, 267–68 (9th Cir. 1992). And the Tenth Circuit requires “active\n\ndeception” by the defendant and diligence by the plaintiff. See Montoya v. Chao,\n\n296 F.3d 952, 957–58 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Cottrell v. Newspaper Agency\n\nCorp., 590 F.2d 836, 838–39 (10th Cir. 1979)).\n\n      Villarreal cites Reeb v. Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., 516 F.2d 924\n\n(5th Cir. 1975), but that decision involved active deception by the employer. We\n\nexplained in Reeb that the employer “actively sought to mislead Mrs. Reeb in\n\ninforming her that adequate funds for her program would no longer be available.”\n\nId. at 930. We held that “[i]n these circumstances we apply the familiar equitable\n\nmodification to statutes of limitation: the statute does not begin to run until the\n\n                                          27\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 28 of 76\n\n\nfacts which would support a cause of action are apparent or should be apparent to a\n\nperson with a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.” Id. Here, Villarreal did not\n\nallege or attempt to allege that R.J. Reynolds actively misled him. As a result, the\n\ngeneral test applies: a plaintiff seeking equitable tolling must prove diligence and\n\nextraordinary circumstances.\n\n      Villarreal is not entitled to equitable tolling because he admitted facts that\n\nforeclose a finding of diligence. Specifically, he alleged that he did nothing for\n\nmore than two years between his initial application and the communication from\n\nthe lawyer. Villarreal argues that any inquiry would have been futile, but even\n\nassuming that futility is an exception to the diligence requirement, it would not\n\napply when a plaintiff does nothing to investigate the status of his application, as\n\nopposed to the reasons for his rejection. We have no difficulty concluding, as a\n\nmatter of law, that a plaintiff who does nothing for two years is not diligent. Cf.\n\nAmini, 259 F.3d at 501 (concluding that a plaintiff was not diligent despite\n\n“‘regular’ computer visits to [the employer’s] website, as well as a physical visit to\n\nthe campus . . . in which [he] searched the [employer’s] announcement boards for\n\ninformation on the new hire” (citation omitted)).\n\n      In his partial dissent, Judge Jordan argues that we should not decide whether\n\nVillarreal is entitled to equitable tolling because Villarreal’s complaint and\n\nproposed amended complaint are silent as to how Villarreal learned that R.J.\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 29 of 76\n\n\nReynolds rejected his application and whether Villarreal acted diligently. This\n\nsilence, according to Judge Jordan, is “not an affirmative allegation” but an\n\n“omission” that prohibits dismissal of Villarreal’s complaint. Op. of Jordan, J.,\n\nat 4–6. We disagree.\n\n      Judge Jordan’s assertion runs counter to the record and ignores Villareal’s\n\nargument. In his proposed amended complaint, Villarreal explained that he learned\n\nabout the rejection of his application from an attorney in 2010, not by his own\n\ndiligence. See Pl.’s Proposed Am. Compl. ¶ 28 (Until 2010 “[Villarreal] did not\n\neven know whether his application had been reviewed at all, much less whether it\n\nhad been rejected or screened out.”). As a result, the district court denied\n\nVillarreal’s motion to file an amended complaint in part because Villarreal had\n\nfailed to allege “any due diligence on his part to determine the status of his 2007\n\napplication.” Villarreal has never contested that he did nothing to ascertain the\n\nstatus of his application until 2010. He neither contested his lack of diligence\n\nbefore the district court, nor has he contested it on appeal. Villarreal instead has\n\nargued that he was not required to inquire about the status of his application and\n\nexercise any due diligence. But when Villarreal chose to anticipate the affirmative\n\ndefense of equitable tolling in his complaint, he bore the burden of alleging facts to\n\nsupport that defense. And this burden required him to allege that he was diligent,\n\nsee Menominee Indian Tribe, 136 S. Ct. at 755–56, which he did not do.\n\n                                          29\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 30 of 76\n\n\n      We conclude that equitable tolling does not apply to the claim of disparate\n\ntreatment, and we affirm in part the dismissal of that claim and the denial of leave\n\nto amend the complaint. Villarreal also argued before the panel that the continuing-\n\nviolation doctrine makes the claim timely, but the panel did not address this\n\nargument. We exercise our discretion to remand this argument to the panel, and we\n\nexpress no view on the issue.\n\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the dismissal of the claim of disparate impact, and we\n\nAFFIRM IN PART the dismissal of the claim of disparate treatment and the\n\ndenial of leave to amend the complaint. We REMAND to the panel to address the\n\ncontinuing-violation doctrine in the first instance.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 31 of 76\n\n\nJORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      I concur in the majority’s ultimate conclusion that Mr. Villarreal cannot\n\nassert a disparate impact claim against R.J. Reynolds. But I write separately\n\nbecause I think there is another way to read 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2), one that would\n\ngive effect to each word in this provision. Although Mr. Villarreal would not\n\nbenefit from my reading of § 623(a)(2), I offer it for the consideration of others\n\nwho may be called upon to interpret the statute in the future.\n\n      At first glance, it might appear that the disparate impact provision of the\n\nADEA is fairly susceptible to two possible interpretations—i.e., one that permits\n\njob applicants to bring disparate impact claims under the ADEA and one that does\n\nnot. If that were the case, I would agree with Judge Martin that we should defer to\n\nthe views of the EEOC, particularly when its position has been consistent for over\n\nthree decades.     The problem, in my view, is that both of these possible\n\ninterpretations fail to give effect to some language in the text.\n\n      “It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\n\nstatute.” United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538–39 (1955). If, in keeping\n\nwith this duty, we can ascertain the statute’s plain meaning, then there is no\n\nambiguity and no need to defer to the agency’s interpretation. See Chevron,\n\nU.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984) (“If a\n\ncourt, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that his\n\n                                          31\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 32 of 76\n\n\nbCongress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the\n\nlaw and must be given effect.”). Significantly, a statute is not ambiguous merely\n\nbecause the parties present “dueling characterizations of what Congress ‘really\n\nmeant.’” CBS Inc. v. PrimeTime 24 Joint Venture, 245 F.3d 1217, 1225 (11th Cir.\n\n2001). Accord Bank of Am. Nat. Trust & Sav. Ass’n v. 203 N. LaSalle St. P’ship,\n\n526 U.S. 434, 461 (1999) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., dissenting) (“A mere\n\ndisagreement among litigants over the meaning of a statute does not prove\n\nambiguity; it usually means that one of the litigants is simply wrong.”).\n\n      The disparate impact provision of the ADEA, § 623(a)(2), says that an\n\nemployer may not “limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which\n\nwould deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n\nage[.]” Under the majority’s reading of the statute, an “individual” can bring a\n\ndisparate impact claim under the ADEA only if he currently has a “status as an\n\nemployee[.]” In other words, the majority reads the statutory language as if the\n\nword “individual” were replaced with the word “employee”:\n\n      to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n      deprive or tend to deprive any individual [an employee] of\n      employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n      an employee, because of [his] age[.]\n\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 33 of 76\n\n\nId. (strikethrough and brackets added). The dissent, for its part, reads the language\n\nas if the statute targeted the impact of an employer’s conduct toward “any\n\nindividual,” and not just “his employees”:\n\n      to limit, segregate, or classify his employees [any individual] in any\n      way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n      employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n      an employee, because of such individual’s age[.]\n\nId. (strikethrough and bracket added). In my view, both readings rewrite language\n\nin the relevant statutory text.\n\n      The statute uses “individual” twice (“any individual” and “such individual”),\n\nand it also uses “employee” twice (“his employees” and “employee”). If we are\n\ntrying to give effect to both critical terms—“his employees” and “any\n\nindividual”—the reading that makes the most sense to me is that a job applicant\n\n(“any individual”) can bring an ADEA claim under a disparate impact theory, but\n\nonly if something the employer has done vis-à-vis “his employees” violates the\n\nADEA by “limit[ing], segregat[ing] or classify[ing]” those employees.       So, if an\n\nemployer’s practice with respect to his employees violates the ADEA, and that\n\nsame practice has a disparate impact on job applicants, those applicants can sue\n\nunder § 623(a)(2).\n\n      To illustrate, imagine a scenario where a company decides to begin using\n\nquestionnaires to test its workers’ social media savvy, even though such\n\nknowledge has no bearing on the employees’ ability to perform their jobs. The\n                                           33\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 34 of 76\n\n\ncompany takes each employee’s performance on the questionnaire into account\n\nwhen it makes promotion decisions. It also distributes the questionnaire to job\n\napplicants, and uses each applicant’s performance in making hiring decisions.\n\nImagine also that the questionnaire requirement disadvantages individuals over the\n\nage of 40 in a disproportionate way. In that scenario, the employer’s conduct\n\ntowards his employees has a disparate impact on current employees as well as job\n\napplicants. And in that scenario, I think a job applicant can sue under § 623(a)(2).\n\nI recognize that reading provides only a narrow set of viable disparate impact\n\nclaims by job applicants, but it gives effect to the way § 623(a)(2) is written.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal, however, challenges only R.J. Reynolds’ hiring practices, and\n\nnot conduct that affects the company’s current employees. He therefore has not\n\nmade out a disparate impact claim under my reading of the statute, and I concur in\n\nthe judgment with respect to the disparate impact claim.\n\n      As for the equitable tolling issue, I agree with Judge Martin’s dissent. In\n\nADEA suits, the applicable limitations period begins to run once the prospective\n\nemployee knows or should know than an unlawful employment practice has been\n\ncommitted. See Hargett v. Valley Fed. Sav. Bank, 60 F.3d 754, 760 (11th Cir.\n\n1995). In his complaint and proposed amended complaint, Mr. Villarreal alleged\n\nthat he did not know the information necessary to support his ADEA claim until\n\nApril of 2010. He also alleged that he was unaware of the resume screening\n\n                                          34\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 35 of 76\n\n\npractices R.J. Reynolds used, and that R.J. Reynolds did not tell him why he had\n\nbeen rejected. The complaints are silent as to how Mr. Villarreal learned he had\n\nbeen rejected, whether he learned that R.J. Reynolds hired an individual under the\n\nage of 40 to fill the territory manager position, and when R.J. Reynolds filled the\n\nposition with a younger candidate. Without a more developed record, it is not\n\nclear to me when Mr. Villarreal should have known that an unlawful employment\n\npractice had been committed and what Mr. Villarreal did to find out. Those are\n\nfact questions. And because tolling is a fact-intensive inquiry, we have explained\n\nthat “[s]ummary judgment is often inappropriate when tolling is at issue in an\n\nADEA action.” Cocke v. Merrill Lynch & Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.\n\n1987). The same is true, of course, at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\n      The majority says that Mr. Villarreal admitted facts, on the face of his\n\ncomplaints, which foreclose a finding of diligence. According to the majority, Mr.\n\nVillarreal specifically alleged that he did nothing for more than two years between\n\nhis initial application and the communication from the lawyer. See Maj. Op. at 22.\n\nBut Mr. Villarreal made no such allegation. Mr. Villarreal said nothing in his\n\ncomplaint or proposed amended complaint about what steps he took, if any, to\n\npursue his rights. And he didn’t have to. Complaints need not anticipate defenses\n\nand attempt to defeat them. See Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 640 (1980). They\n\nneed only allege enough facts to show that a claim for relief is plausible. See Bell\n\n                                         35\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 36 of 76\n\n\nAtlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). Although a plaintiff may\n\nplead himself out of court by making affirmative allegations that show there is a\n\nbulletproof defense, an omission (i.e., silence) is not an affirmative allegation,\n\nparticularly not at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. Because we must view the complaint in\n\nthe light most favorable to Mr. Villarreal and draw all reasonable inferences in his\n\nfavor, see McNutt ex rel. U.S. v. Haleyville Med. Supplies, Inc., 423 F.3d 1256,\n\n1259 (11th Cir. 2005), I think the majority errs in holding that dismissal was\n\nappropriate on statute of limitations grounds.\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 37 of 76\n\n\nROSENBAUM, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      This is a difficult case, but not because the statutory language we must\n\nconstrue is unclear—in my opinion, it isn’t. No, this case is challenging because\n\ndespite the clarity of the statutory language, the agency charged with administering\n\nthe statute has, for nearly the past 50 years—through both Republican and\n\nDemocrat administrations—consistently construed it in a way that conflicts with\n\nwhat appears to me to be the objectively indisputable meaning of the statutory\n\nlanguage.    That fact gives me serious pause.     And so I have examined and\n\nreexamined the statutory language for ambiguity. Despite my best efforts, I am\n\nunable to find any. Since the statute is, in my view, susceptible of only a single\n\ninterpretation, as the Majority points out, we must abide by its plain meaning,\n\nwithout resorting to the administering agency’s construction.\n\n      Though I agree with the Majority on the interpretation of the ADEA, I\n\ndisagree with the Majority on the equitable-tolling issue, for the reasons expressed\n\nby both Judges Martin and Jordan. So I dissent from the Majority opinion and join\n\nthe dissents on that issue.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      By any measure, in my view, the statutory language of § 4(a)(2) of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) is unambiguous. I do not see how\n\nthe statutory language itself, the structure of the ADEA, and the historical\n\n                                        37\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 38 of 76\n\n\nsequence of amendments and proposed amendments to both the ADEA and Title\n\nVII, on which the ADEA was based, leave any other possibility. I write separately\n\nto explain why this is so.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      The Majority has already explained why the statutory language is clear. I\n\nagree with that analysis and add the following.\n\n      Section 4(a)(2) makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n\nan employee, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). The term\n\n“otherwise” in this statute must mean something. If not, Congress could have left\n\nit out, and the statute could have stated simply, “in any way which would deprive\n\nor tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee . . . .” And if that were the case, the phrases “in any way\n\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” and “adversely affect his status as an employee” could be read in the\n\ndisjunctive, entirely independent of each other, allowing a plaintiff to show that an\n\nemployer’s actions violated his rights either by “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive\n\n[him] of employment opportunities” or by “adversely affect[ing] his status as an\n\nemployee.”\n\n                                         38\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 39 of 76\n\n\n      But that is not what § 4(a)(2) says. It uses the word “otherwise” to modify\n\nthe phrase “adversely affect his status as an employee.” And “otherwise” has\n\nmeaning. “Otherwise” signals that the two phrases in § 4(a)(2) cannot be entirely\n\nindependent of each other; instead, a relationship between the two phrases exists.\n\nIn that relationship, each phrase describes a mutually exclusive subset of the\n\nuniverse of actions that “adversely affect . . . status as an employee.” Together,\n\nthese two subsets compose the entirety of the universe of actions that “adversely\n\naffect . . . status as an employee.”\n\n      “Otherwise” means “[i]n another way; differently.”             Otherwise, The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000). Because\n\n“otherwise” is an adverb that modifies “adversely affect” in this case, “otherwise\n\nadversely affect his status as an employee” refers to actions that would “adversely\n\naffect . . . status as an employee” in any way that is different from the manner in\n\nwhich “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” would “adversely affect . . . status as an employee.” So the first\n\nphrase—“in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities”—refers to actions that limit or preclude, for example,\n\npromotion opportunities, while the second—“otherwise adversely affect . . . status\n\nas an employee”—contemplates actions that would, for instance, result in\n\ndemotions, layoffs, or terminations.\n\n                                          39\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 40 of 76\n\n\n      Because of the word “otherwise,” no other construction makes sense to me.\n\n      And since the word “otherwise” necessarily means that “depriv[ing] or\n\ntend[ing] to deprive any individual of employment opportunities” is a subset of\n\n“adversely affect[ing] . . . status as an employee,” § 4(a)(2) cannot cover disparate-\n\nincome hiring claims. “[D]epriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities” by not hiring a person who is not an employee cannot\n\n“adversely affect his status as an employee” because he has no “status as an\n\nemployee.” Instead, his status is and remains that of a non-employee.\n\n      Plus, “affect” means “[t]o have an influence on or effect a change in.”\n\nAffect, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000).\n\nBut to change something, it must exist in the first place. If a person has no “status\n\nas an employee,” “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive” that person “of employment\n\nopportunities” does not change that person’s status as a non-employee; he started\n\nas a non-employee, and he remains a non-employee.\n\n      And finally, “adversely” means in a manner “[c]ontrary to one’s interests or\n\nwelfare; harmful or unfavorable.” Adverse, The American Heritage Dictionary of\n\nthe English Language (4th ed. 2000). So unfavorably changing a person’s status as\n\nan employee necessarily refers to harming that person’s status as an employee. If a\n\nperson is not an employee, there is no “status as an employee” that an employer\n\ncan harm.\n\n                                         40\n\f             Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 41 of 76\n\n\n      So the language of § 4(a)(2) is susceptible of only a single interpretation that\n\nmakes sense to me—and that interpretation does not provide for coverage of\n\ndisparate-impact hiring claims.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      The Majority also describes how the structure of the ADEA requires the\n\ninterpretation of § 4(a)(2) as not providing coverage for disparate-impact hiring\n\nclaims. I concur in that discussion but wish to further elaborate.\n\n      In particular, the Majority compares § 4(a)(2) to § 4(c)(2), noting that the\n\nprovisions are “largely parallel” except that § 4(c)(2) includes the phrase “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” after its use of the term “employee.” To demonstrate\n\nwhy this point is so persuasive, it is helpful to look at both statutes together.\n\n      Section 4(a)(2) makes it unlawful for an employer\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any\n             way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n             individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n             adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n             such individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (emphasis added). Section 4(c)(2) makes it unlawful for a\n\nlabor organization\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify its membership, or to\n             classify or fail or refuse to refer for employment any\n             individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to\n             deprive any individual of employment opportunities,\n             or would limit such employment opportunities or\n             otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee or\n\n                                           41\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 42 of 76\n\n\n             as an applicant for employment, because of such\n             individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2) (emphasis added). The bolded portions of each statute are\n\nexactly the same. As for the regular-style portions of the statutes, though they are\n\ndifferent, they do not differ in a manner that affects the analysis of whether each\n\nstatute contemplates coverage of applicants for employment.\n\n      True, as Judge Martin points out, § 4(c)(2) deals with labor organizations\n\nand, in part, their role in employment opportunities, but that fact does not explain\n\nwhy the phrase “or as an applicant for employment” needed to be added in §\n\n4(c)(2) to cover applicants for employment if it did not need to be included in §\n\n4(a)(2) to cover applicants for employment. Nor have I been able to figure out\n\nwhy the fact that § 4(c)(2) deals with labor organizations while § 4(a)(2) deals with\n\nemployers matters to the analysis of why the phrase “or as an applicant for\n\nemployment” appears in § 4(c)(2) but not § 4(a)(2).\n\n      It seems to me that if the language in § 4(a)(2) covered applicants for\n\nemployment, the exact same language in § 4(c)(2) would suffice to do the same\n\nthing—regardless of the fact that one statute addresses employers and the other,\n\nlabor organizations. Yet Congress felt the need to add the phrase “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” after “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n\nemployee” in § 4(c)(2) to cover applicants. Why would Congress do that if\n\n“applicant[s] for employment” were already covered by the language in § 4(a)(2)?\n                                         42\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 43 of 76\n\n\n       The phrase “applicant [or applicants] for employment” also appears in other\n\nplaces in the ADEA. See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 623(d); 29 U.S.C. § 631(b); 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 633a(a), (b).       Clearly, Congress knew how to and did expressly include\n\n“applicants for employment” when it wished to do so. But conspicuously absent\n\nfrom § 4(a)(2) is any reference to “applicants for employment.” We must account\n\nfor this fact in a meaningful way. The only way that makes sense to me is that\n\nCongress provided coverage for disparate-impact hiring-related claims under\n\n§4(c)(2) but not under § 4(a)(2).\n\n                                                C.\n\n       The historical chronology of events relating to the enactment and\n\namendments of the ADEA and Title VII further demonstrates that § 4(a)(2) does\n\nnot cover disparate-impact hiring claims. 1\n\n\n       1\n          Judge Martin suggests that we should not consider the legislative sequence of events.\nSee Martin Dissent at n.5. In support of this position, she relies on Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, 530 U.S. 363 (2000), as an example of a case where the Supreme Court “refused\nto conclude that Congress ‘repeatedly declin[ing] to enact express preemption provisions’\nimplied anything ‘simply because the silence of Congress is ambiguous.’” Id. at 386–88, 120 S.\nCt. at 2301–02. The circumstances at issue in Crosby, however, are readily distinguishable from\nthose in this case, and I respectfully disagree that Crosby provides any support for the notion that\nthe legislative sequence of amendments in this case is irrelevant. In Crosby, Massachusetts\nenacted a statute barring state entities from buying goods or services from companies doing\nbusiness with Burma. Three months later, Congress passed a law imposing mandatory and\nconditional sanctions on Burma. The Supreme Court found Massachusetts’s law to be\npreempted by federal law because it stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of\nthe purposes and objectives of Congress. Id. at 372-73. In doing so, the Court rejected\nMassachusetts’s argument that Congress’s failure to preempt the state act demonstrated “implicit\npermission.” Id. at 387-88. In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained the unique nature of\npreemption:\n\n                                                43\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 44 of 76\n\n\n       In 1964, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADEA, which\n\nCongress enacted on December 15, 1967, was modeled after the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964. So § 703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA, at the time it was enacted, were exactly the same, except for the groups\n\nthat each provision protected. Section 703(a)(2) stated,\n\n               It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n               employer—(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n               employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n               deprive an individual of employment opportunities or\n               otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n               because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n               national origin.\n\n\n               A failure to provide for preemption expressly may reflect nothing\n               more than the settled character of implied preemption doctrine that\n               courts will dependably apply, and in any event, the existence of\n               conflict cognizable under the Supremacy Clause does not depend\n               on express congressional recognition that federal and state law\n               may conflict. . . . The State’s inference of congressional intent is\n               unwarranted here, therefore, simply because the silence of\n               Congress is ambiguous.\n\nId. (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In other words, the mere fact that Congress did not\nexpressly preempt state action in the original statute or amend the statute later to preempt state\naction did not mean that Congress intended to authorize state action because Congress can\nimpliedly preempt state action. Of course, Villarreal’s case does not involve preemption, so for\nthat reason alone, Crosby is not instructive. But, in any case, I do not suggest considering\nCongress’s failure to amend § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA by adding the words “applicants for\nemployment,” in a vacuum, like the state did in Crosby. Instead, my point is that a comparison\nof the amendment made to § 703(a)(2) of Title VII—the statute on which the ADEA was\nbased—to the failure to make the same or similar amendment to the exact same language in §\n4(a)(2) of the ADEA, all within the same general time frame as Congress otherwise amended the\nADEA to add the same phrase that it added to § 703(a)(2) of Title VII—“applicants for\nemployment”—is meaningful. This sequence of events indicates that Congress understood a\ndifference between including the language “applicants for employment” and not doing so, and it\nacted deliberately in choosing to add that language to Title VII’s counterpart to the ADEA’s §\n4(a)(2) and to other sections of the ADEA but not to § 4(a)(2).\n\n                                               44\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 45 of 76\n\n\n\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255.\n\n       But significantly, in February 1967—ten months before Congress enacted\n\nthe ADEA—it considered Senate Bill 1026, which sought to amend § 703(a)(2) of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 to “[a]dd the phrase ‘or applicants for employment’\n\nafter the phrase ‘his employees in section 703(a)(2).” 113 CONG. REC. 3951\n\n(1967). While the amendment did not pass in 1967, Congress considered similar\n\nbills proposing the same amendment until it ultimately enacted the Equal\n\nEmployment Act of 1972 on March 24, 1972. That Act amended § 703(a)(2) of\n\nTitle VII to add the phrase “or applicants for employment” after the phrase “his\n\nemployees.” See Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-261, 86\n\nStat. 103, 109.\n\n      In stark contrast, Congress has never similarly amended the ADEA’s parallel\n\n§ 4(a)(2). Instead, to this day, unlike § 703(a)(2), § 4(a)(2) continues to lack the\n\nphrase “or applicants for employment.” That Congress had considered amending\n\nthe very same language in Title VII that appears in § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, to add\n\nthe phrase “or applicants for employment”—even before Congress enacted the\n\nADEA—and that it ultimately did amend that same language in Title VII but did\n\nnot so amend § 4(a)(2), again strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to\n\ncover disparate-impact hiring claims in § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA.\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                 Case: 15-10602   Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 46 of 76\n\n\n      This historical fact takes on even more significance, in light of amendments\n\nto the ADEA that Congress enacted two years after it amended Title VII to include\n\n“applicants for employment.” In 1974, Congress amended the ADEA to make it\n\napplicable to federal-government employment.               See Fair Labor Standards\n\nAmendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-259, 88 Stat. 55, 74.                Notably, Congress\n\nexpressly made the new provisions (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 633a) applicable to\n\nboth employees and “applicants for employment.” See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a).\n\nYet while Congress amended the ADEA, in part to add coverage for “applicants\n\nfor employment” in federal-government employment, it made no amendment to §\n\n4(a)(2) to add “applicants for employment,” despite having amended the parallel\n\nlanguage of § 703(a)(2) of Title VII to add “applicants for employment” just two\n\nyears earlier.\n\n      So to recap, the “applicants for employment” issue was on Congress’s radar\n\nscreen at the time that it enacted the ADEA without that language in § 4(a)(2); at\n\nthe time that it amended the parallel provision of Title VII, after the ADEA had\n\nalready been enacted; and at the time that Congress amended the ADEA itself, in\n\npart to provide coverage to “applicants for employment” in federal-government\n\nemployment. At any one of these times, Congress easily could have chosen to add\n\nthe “applicants for employment” language to § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. It did not.\n\nWe can’t ignore that fact.\n\n                                           46\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 47 of 76\n\n\n       Nor does Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228 (2005), suggest that we can.\n\nSignificantly, the Smith plurality “agree[d] that the differences between age and the\n\nclasses protected in Title VII are relevant, and that Congress might well have\n\nintended to treat the two differently.” Id. at 236 n.7 (plurality opinion). The\n\nplurality then cautioned that differences between the texts of Title VII and the\n\nADEA are important, noting that differences between age and the classes protected\n\nin Title VII, “coupled with a difference in the text of the statute . . . , may warrant\n\naddressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently.” 2 Id. (emphasis\n\nin original). That is precisely what we have when we compare the texts of §\n\n4(a)(2) of the ADEA and § 703(a)(2) of Title VII. Indeed, though the plurality did\n\nnot consider whether § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA covers disparate-impact hiring claims,\n\nthe plurality nonetheless recognized that “the scope of disparate-impact liability\n\nunder ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.” Id. at 240 (plurality opinion).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          While, as Judge Martin points out in footnote 8 of her dissent, §4(f)(1) of the ADEA\nwas the provision under consideration in Smith, the Supreme Court did not limit its\npronouncement that differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII, “coupled with\na difference in the text of the statute . . . , may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the\ntwo statutes differently,” as pertaining solely to differences between Title VII and § 4(f)(1) of the\nADEA. Smith, 544 U.S. at 236 n.7 (plurality opinion). Instead, the Supreme Court broadly\nphrased its statement as a rule to be followed in the analysis of all disparate-impact claims under\nthe ADEA and Title VII. It just so happened in Smith, though, that the Supreme Court was\nconsidering only whether § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA provides for a disparate-impact claim of any\ntype to anyone. It was not looking at the issue of whether § 4(a)(2) provides for a disparate-\nimpact claim in the context of hiring decisions.\n\n                                                 47\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 48 of 76\n\n\n      For these reasons, I cannot find the ambiguity in § 4(a)(2) that my dissenting\n\ncolleagues describe, so I concur in the Majority’s decision holding that § 4(a)(2)\n\ndoes not provide coverage for disparate-impact hiring claims.\n\n      Nevertheless, as the Majority notes, see Maj. Op. at 24, that fact does not\n\nrender disparate-impact evidence irrelevant or inadmissible in disparate-treatment\n\ncases under the ADEA. To the contrary, disparate-impact evidence can play an\n\nimportant role in proving a disparate-treatment claim, and nothing we have said\n\nhere today suggests otherwise.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Because the language of § 4(a)(2), the statutory structure of the ADEA, and\n\nthe history of amendments to the ADEA and Title VII all lead to only one viable\n\ninterpretation of the meaning of § 4(a)(2), I concur in the Majority’s decision to the\n\nextent that it holds that no cause of action for disparate impact hiring exists under\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n      But I dissent from the Majority’s decision on the equitable-tolling issue and\n\njoin the dissents of my colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 49 of 76\n\n\nMARTIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which WILSON and JILL PRYOR, Circuit\nJudges, join, and JORDAN and ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judges, join as to Part II:\n\n      The Supreme Court told us in Smith v. City of Jackson, 544 U.S. 228, 125 S.\n\nCt. 1536 (2005), that people who have been discriminated against because of their\n\nage can rely on the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) to\n\nbring disparate impact claims. A disparate impact claim asserts that an employer\n\nengages in practices that may look neutral on their face, but in fact treat one group\n\nmore harshly than another. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\n\n335 n.15, 97 S. Ct 1843, 1854 n.15 (1977). Today’s decision by the majority\n\nmakes ours the first court of appeals to hold that Smith does not allow for disparate\n\nimpact claims by people alleging discrimination in hiring. To get to this result, the\n\nmajority ignores the plain text of the ADEA; rejects the interpretation that the\n\ngoverning agencies have used since 1968; and misreads the Supreme Court’s\n\nlandmark decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 91 S. Ct. 849\n\n(1971). Specifically, the majority says Griggs had nothing to do with\n\ndiscrimination in hiring. But to the contrary, Griggs did create disparate impact\n\nliability for discriminatory “hiring criteria.” Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs\n\nv. Inclusive Cmtys. Project, Inc., 576 U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 2507, 2517 (2015).\n\nThe text of the ADEA that we interpret here is identical to the text the Supreme\n\nCourt interpreted in Griggs. This is just one of many reasons why this court should\n\nhave reached the same result as the Supreme Court did in Griggs, and allowed\n                                          49\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 50 of 76\n\n\nRichard Villarreal’s disparate impact claim against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\n\nCompany (RJ Reynolds) to proceed.\n\n      Griggs isn’t the only seminal civil rights case the majority misreads. The\n\nmajority also says that Reeb v. Economic Opportunity Atlanta, Inc., 516 F.2d 924\n\n(5th Cir. 1975), did not do what everyone has always said it did. Mr. Villarreal\n\nsays he couldn’t know that RJ Reynolds broke the law because the company did so\n\nin secret. For over forty years, this court has equitably tolled the limitations period\n\nfor filing suit on discrimination claims “until the facts which would support a cause\n\nof action are apparent or should be apparent to a person with a reasonably prudent\n\nregard for his rights.” Id. at 930. The reason for this rule is simple: “Secret\n\npreferences in hiring and even more subtle means of illegal discrimination, because\n\nof their very nature, are unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual\n\ndiscriminated against.” Id. at 931. The majority now tells us that secret\n\ndiscrimination won’t be punished unless the victim tried to expose the\n\ndiscrimination himself, even if he had no reason to suspect anyone was\n\ndiscriminating against him. This is contrary to our precedent. Our court has\n\ntraditionally required victims of discrimination to act with reasonable diligence.\n\nNow, the majority requires victims to act with diligence beyond what reason would\n\nsuggest.\n\n\n\n\n                                          50\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 51 of 76\n\n\n      Both of the majority’s holdings in this case do harm to this court’s precedent\n\nand to the nation’s anti-discrimination laws. I respectfully dissent.\n\n                                           I.\n\n      Section 4(a)(2) of the ADEA says an employer may not\n\n      limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would\n      deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities\n      or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n      such individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). This plainly describes what RJ Reynolds did to Mr.\n\nVillarreal. Specifically, Mr. Villarreal is an “individual” who was “deprive[d]” “of\n\nemployment opportunities” and denied any “status as an employee” because of\n\nsomething an employer did to “limit . . . his employees.” To use a simple example,\n\nsuppose a restaurant owner says he will pay college students more than he pays\n\nother employees. Smith said this kind of wage differentiation could violate the\n\nADEA. Now suppose the same employer says he won’t even hire someone who is\n\nnot a college student. This is plainly a decision to “limit . . . his employees” to\n\ncollege students. And college students tend to be young, so this limit may “tend to\n\ndeprive an[] individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” More to the point, an\n\nolder “individual” could find himself “deprive[d] . . . of employment\n\nopportunities” or denied any “status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 52 of 76\n\n\nage.” The plain text of the statute covers a claim like this. And this perfectly\n\nnatural reading is the one the EEOC has always used.\n\n      The majority says: no, when Congress wrote “to limit, segregate, or classify\n\nhis employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual\n\nof employment opportunities” what it really meant (and said without ambiguity)\n\nwas “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive\n\nor tend to deprive [those] individual[s] of employment opportunities.” The\n\nmajority says the only reasonable reading of § 4(a)(2) is that the earlier reference\n\nto “his employees” (which describes who an employer can’t “limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify”) must be assumed to impliedly narrow the plainly broader reference to\n\n“any individual” (which describes who can’t be deprived of employment\n\nopportunities based on the employer’s actions).\n\n      That’s not what the statute says. Congress said age discrimination must not\n\n“deprive any individual of employment opportunities.” If Congress intended to\n\nprotect a narrower group, it would have said so. For example, the same sentence\n\nof § 4(a)(2) later uses the term “such individuals” to refer back to a set of people\n\nwho were introduced earlier. And a different part of the sentence uses the word\n\n“employees,” when referring to the people an employer can’t “limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify.” But when the statute described the group who would be protected by this\n\nprohibition imposed on employers, Congress chose the term “any individual.”\n\n                                          52\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 53 of 76\n\n\n“This deliberate variation in terminology within the same sentence of a statute\n\nsuggests that Congress did not interpret the two terms as being equivalent.” United\n\nStates v. Williams, 340 F.3d 1231, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003). The rest of § 4(a)(2)\n\nshows that Congress knew how to use narrower terms, but it chose to say “any\n\nindividual” when referring to who can be injured by an employer’s discrimination.\n\nWe can’t ignore that choice. To the contrary, “[t]he interpretive canon that\n\nCongress acts intentionally when it omits language included elsewhere applies\n\nwith particular force” here, because Congress used the same language “in close\n\nproximity—indeed, in the same sentence.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. MacLean,\n\n__ U.S. __, __, 135 S. Ct. 913, 919 (2015).\n\n      Saying the term “any individual” really means “employees” isn’t the only\n\nway that the majority rewrites § 4(a)(2). The majority also says the phrase\n\n“deprive any individual of employment opportunities” can’t mean refusing to hire\n\nsomeone. The majority’s position here is that these clear words (again, “deprive\n\nany individual of employment opportunities”) are impliedly limited by the later\n\nphrase “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee” in such a way that\n\na person can never be “deprived of an employment opportunity” unless he also\n\nloses a current “status as an employee.” Maj. Op. at 10. There are at least two\n\nproblems with this. First, the majority reads “deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities” out of the statute. This violates the principle that\n\n                                         53\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016      Page: 54 of 76\n\n\n“every word [in a statute] is to be given effect.” Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.\n\nGarner, Reading Law 174 (2012).\n\n       Second, even if we do take those words out of the statute, § 4(a)(2) still\n\napplies to Mr. Villarreal’s case through the statute’s “adversely affect his status as\n\nan employee” language. Certainly it is true that Mr. Villarreal was denied any\n\n“status as an employee.” Yet the majority says “affect his status as an employee”\n\ncan’t refer to a job that someone wanted but didn’t get because, according to the\n\nmajority, “[d]ictionaries confirm that the phrase ‘status as an employee’ connotes a\n\npresent fact.” Maj. Op. at 10. This resort to abstract definitions is puzzling.\n\nDictionaries say what a word means. They are far less useful for figuring out what\n\ntense a word “connotes,” since the same word can connote different tenses in\n\ndifferent contexts. And before using dictionaries to “confirm” the tense of a word\n\nin a statute, I would go to the Dictionary Act, which says that “unless the context\n\nindicates otherwise . . . words used in the present tense include the future as well as\n\nthe present.” 1 U.S.C. § 1. 1\n\n       Also, the majority’s statement that the phrase “status as an employee”\n\nalways “connotes a present fact” is just plain wrong. Title VII also uses the words\n\n“deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n\n       1\n          The Dictionary Act was enacted in 1871 and must “be treated as if incorporated in and\nas a part of subsequent enactments.” Great N. Ry. Co. v. United States, 208 U.S. 452, 465, 28 S.\nCt. 313, 316 (1908).\n\n                                               54\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 55 of 76\n\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2)\n\n(emphasis added). And in Title VII, those exact same words prohibit hiring\n\ndiscrimination. Even so, the majority says it’s impossible for the identical words\n\nto do the same job in the ADEA. Also, Title VII isn’t the only place where the\n\nword “status” is used to describe a status someone wanted but didn’t get. “Status”\n\nis used this way all the time. For example, a disability claimant can be “denied her\n\nstatus as disabled.” Joseph v. Chater, 84 F.3d 433, 433 (5th Cir. 1996) (per\n\ncuriam). Or an alien can be “denied status as a permanent resident.” Santos v.\n\nImmigration & Naturalization Serv., 375 F.2d 262, 264 n.1 (9th Cir. 1967).2 The\n\nusage of the word “status” is clear once we leave the abstraction of dictionaries and\n\nlook at how the word is used in actual writing.\n\n       In fact, the Supreme Court has even told us that when the word “employee”\n\n“lacks any temporal qualifier” it can include people other than current employees.\n\nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 342, 117 S. Ct. 843, 846–847 (1997).\n\nJustice Thomas’s unanimous opinion explained that parts of Title VII “use the term\n\n\n       2\n           I could go on. Someone trying to bring a class action can be “denied his status as class\nrepresentative.” Duncan v. Tennessee, 84 F.R.D. 21, 32 (M.D. Tenn. 1979). Someone trying to\nfile a claim in bankruptcy court could be “denied priority status.” Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v.\nZurich Am. Ins. Co., 547 U.S. 651, 656, 126 S. Ct. 2105, 2109 (2006). Someone trying to work\nat sea can “be denied seaman status.” Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 372, 115 S. Ct.\n2172, 2191 (1995). Someone trying to do seasonal work could be “denied SAW [special\nagricultural worker] status.” McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 496, 111 S. Ct.\n888, 898 (1991). Someone drafted into war could “be denied CO [conscientious objector]\nstatus.” Clark v. Gabriel, 393 U.S. 256, 264, 89 S. Ct. 424, 429 (1968). Cases like Santos show\nhow the word “status” was used when Congress wrote the ADEA in 1967.\n                                                55\n\f                Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 56 of 76\n\n\n‘employees’ to mean something other than current employees,” including at least\n\none place where the term “most naturally is read to mean ‘prospective\n\nemployees.’” 519 U.S. at 343 n.3, 117 S. Ct. at 847 n.3. Robinson underscores\n\nhow radical the majority’s reading of § 4(a)(2) is. If “employees” can mean\n\nprospective employees, surely “any individual” can too. But the majority says\n\n“any individual” unambiguously means “current employees” only. That can’t be\n\nright.\n\n         The text of the ADEA makes plain that “any individual” who is “deprive[d]\n\n. . . of employment opportunities” because of his age can a file a disparate impact\n\nclaim. The majority never explains why Congress chose the term “any individual”\n\nin § 4(a)(2) if it really meant “employee.” I say “any individual” means “any\n\nindividual.” The plain text of § 4(a)(2) resolves this case in Mr. Villarreal’s favor.\n\nAnd this reading is only further confirmed by: (1) other parts of the ADEA; (2) the\n\nGriggs case; (3) the Smith case; and (4) deference to the EEOC. I will discuss\n\neach in turn.\n\n                                           A.\n\n         The phrasing of the rest of § 4(a) confirms that “any individual” in § 4(a)(2)\n\nmeans “any individual.” For example, no one disputes that “any individual” in\n\n§ 4(a)(1) refers to job applicants. And “a word or phrase is presumed to bear the\n\nsame meaning throughout a text.” Scalia & Garner, supra at 170. In fact,\n\n                                            56\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 57 of 76\n\n\nwhenever Congress meant anything other than “any individual” in § 4(a), it said so.\n\nSection 4(a) has three subsections, and only one does not use the term “any\n\nindividual.” That is § 4(a)(3), which prohibits “reduc[ing] the wage rate of any\n\nemployee.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(3) (emphasis added). Since employees earn wages\n\nand non-employees do not, no one disputes that § 4(a)(3) applies solely to\n\nemployees. Thus, Congress’s choice of “any employee” rather than “any\n\nindividual” in § 4(a)(3) makes sense.\n\n      In fact, § 4(a)(3) is a great tool for showing why the majority’s imposition of\n\nextra-textual meaning onto § 4(a)(2) is so wrong. The majority says Congress\n\nexpected courts to divine from other parts of the statute that “any individual” in\n\n§ 4(a)(2) actually means “any employee.” If that’s true, Congress should have said\n\n“any individual” in § 4(a)(3) too. That is because everyone could divine from\n\n“wage rate” that “any individual” implicitly meant “any employee.” Indeed, for\n\n§ 4(a)(3) that assumption would be safer than for § 4(a)(2), since by definition,\n\nnobody other than employees can have their wage rates reduced. Yet Congress\n\nstill said “any employee” rather than leaving this meaning to inference. Every time\n\nCongress meant “any employee” it said “any employee.” And every time it meant\n\n“any individual” it said “any individual.” In § 4(a)(2) it said “any individual.”\n\n      The majority compares § 4(a)(2) to other parts of the ADEA too, but both\n\nthose arguments end up confirming why “any individual” in § 4(a)(2) really means\n\n                                         57\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 58 of 76\n\n\n“any individual.” First, the majority asserts that “[u]nlike section 4(a)(1), section\n\n4(a)(2) does not mention an employer refusing to hire someone.” Maj. Op. at 15.\n\nAccording to the majority, this means § 4(a)(2) can’t possibly apply to hiring\n\nclaims. The majority accurately reports that § 4(a)(1) includes the phrase “refuse\n\nto hire” and § 4(a)(2) does not. But § 4(a)(1) also says “to discharge” and then\n\n§ 4(a)(2) does not. Applying the majority’s same logic therefore, we would have\n\nto say that § 4(a)(2) doesn’t protect an employee from getting fired because of his\n\nage. When asked about this at oral argument, RJ Reynolds responded that\n\n§ 4(a)(2) does impose liability on an employer who fires someone for being old,\n\nbut that liability comes from the later “adversely affect his status as an employee”\n\nlanguage in § 4(a)(2). But if firing claims come from that later language despite\n\nthe earlier “to limit, segregate, or classify” language (which says nothing about\n\nfiring), then surely failure-to-hire claims can come from the later “deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities” language. As we know, that same\n\nlanguage in Title VII allows failure-to-hire claims. It must certainly do the same in\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n      Second, the majority points to § 4(c)(2), which uses the words “status as an\n\nemployee or as an applicant for employment” rather than “status as an employee”\n\nlike § 4(a)(2). Maj. Op. at 14–15. The majority says this means § 4(a)(2) can’t\n\nprotect people who weren’t hired for a job because of their age. The problem with\n\n                                          58\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 59 of 76\n\n\nthe majority’s reliance on § 4(c)(2) is that this subsection governs labor\n\norganizations, not employers. Specifically, it governs a labor organization’s ability\n\nto “refuse to refer for employment.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2) (emphasis added).\n\nThis part of the statute targets the unique way in which labor organizations can\n\ndiscriminate when they “refer” “applicants” to employers, such as through union\n\nhiring halls. 3 None of the other parts of the ADEA that govern employers say\n\nanything about “referring” anyone for employment. Employers, after all, don’t\n\n“refer applicants.” But labor organizations, by virtue of their unique referral role,\n\nare sometimes the sole conduit by which an employer can get potential job\n\napplicants.4 And § 4(c)(2) prohibits labor organizations from “refus[ing] to refer”\n\na person for employment at all because of her age and thereby denying her “status .\n\n. . as an applicant for employment.” In other words, the statute protects someone\n\nwho sought work but was denied status as an applicant—that is, being allowed to\n\n       3\n        For historical background on discriminatory union hiring halls, see Irving Kovarsky,\nCurrent Remedies for the Discriminatory Effects of Seniority Agreements, 24 Vand.

It’s\n\nsometimes dangerous to infer what Congress meant in one part of a statute based\n\non what it didn’t say in other parts, at least without close analysis. 5\n\n                                                B.\n\n       I read the ADEA in the same way the Supreme Court read identical Title VII\n\nlanguage in the seminal Griggs opinion. Griggs held that this identical language in\n\nTitle VII authorizes disparate impact claims. When Smith read disparate impact\n\nliability into the ADEA, the Court “beg[a]n with the premise that when Congress\n\nuses the same language in two statutes having similar purposes, particularly when\n\none is enacted shortly after the other, it is appropriate to presume that Congress\n\nintended that text to have the same meaning in both statutes.” 544 U.S. at 233, 125\n\nS. Ct. at 1541. The majority says Griggs is irrelevant because the plaintiffs in that\n\ncase were current employees, not job applicants. Maj. Op. at 18–20. But the\n\n\n       5\n          Along these lines, it’s also dangerous to infer what Congress meant in a statute based on\nwhat it didn’t say at all. Judge Rosenbaum’s concurrence details the history of the ADEA, which\ntracks the language of Title VII. She focuses particularly on the fact that Congress never\namended the ADEA to add the phrase “or applicants for employment” to § 4(a)(2). But we\ncannot know what Congress meant by not amending the ADEA. Perhaps Judge Rosenbaum’s\ntheory on Congressional intent is correct, but it’s equally possible that Congress did not act\nbecause it thought the statute already encompassed job applicants. That is why the Supreme\nCourt has warned us as a general rule not to give weight to legislative inaction when interpreting\nstatutes. For example, in Crosby v. National Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 120 S. Ct.\n2288 (2000), the Court refused to conclude that Congress “repeatedly declin[ing] to enact\nexpress preemption provisions” implied anything “simply because the silence of Congress is\nambiguous.” Id. at 386–88, 120 S. Ct. at 2301–02. Although Judge Rosenbaum notes that\nCrosby was about preemption and not the ADEA, my point remains unchanged: we simply\nshould not consider legislative inaction when interpreting statutes.\n\n                                                60\n\f                Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 61 of 76\n\n\nemployment requirements challenged in Griggs were used both for initial hiring as\n\nwell as for those already employed, but who were seeking to transfer to other\n\npositions within the company. See 401 U.S. at 427–28, 91 S. Ct. at 852. And the\n\nfirst sentence of the Supreme Court’s unanimous opinion declared that the Court\n\nwas deciding “whether an employer is prohibited . . . from requiring a high school\n\neducation or passing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of\n\nemployment.” 401 U.S. at 425–26, 91 S. Ct. at 851 (emphasis added). The Court\n\nbroadly held that Title VII forbids employment selection practices that are “fair in\n\nform but discriminatory in operation,” and it did not distinguish between the hiring\n\nemployees and allowing them to transfer within the company. See id. at 431, 91 S.\n\nCt. at 853.\n\n       The Supreme Court has never limited Griggs as the majority suggests. To\n\nthe contrary, the Supreme Court has characterized Griggs as protecting job\n\napplicants.6 See Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 446, 102 S. Ct. 2525, 2530\n\n\n\n       6\n         Our Court has also characterized Griggs in this way. See EEOC v. Joe’s Stone Crab,\nInc., 220 F.3d 1263, 1279 n.16 (11th Cir. 2000) (“In Griggs . . . the plaintiffs showed that the\nobjective and facially neutral requirements . . . in order to be hired or transferred . . . had a\ndisproportionate effect on white and black applicants.”); id. at 1282 n.18 (reading Griggs to\napply to “neutral hiring and promotion practices”); Watkins v. Scott Paper Co., 530 F.2d 1159,\n1179 (5th Cir. 1976) (“In Griggs, the Supreme Court held that a high school diploma\nrequirement for hiring and transfer was not justified by business necessity.”); United States v.\nGa. Power Co., 474 F.2d 906, 911 (5th Cir. 1973) (“In Griggs . . . the Supreme Court held that\nthe proviso of this section means that no test used for hiring or promotion is valid if it ‘operates\nto exclude [African Americans] [and] cannot be shown to be related to job performance.’”\n(second alteration in original)).\n\n                                                 61\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 62 of 76\n\n\n(1982) (noting that the challenged employment requirements in Griggs “applied\n\nequally to white and black employees and applicants, [but] barred employment\n\nopportunities to a disproportionate number of blacks”); id. at 458 n.2, 102 S. Ct. at\n\n2536 n.2 (Powell, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.J., and O’Connor, J., dissenting)\n\n(noting that the tests in Griggs “were an absolute bar to transfers or hiring”).\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court’s most recent disparate impact case says Griggs\n\ngoverned “hiring criteria.” Inclusive Cmtys. Project, 135 S. Ct. at 2517. This\n\nmakes sense, because Griggs itself was broadly concerned with protecting the\n\ninterests of minority groups, both in securing and improving employment\n\nopportunities. See 401 U.S. at 430–31, 91 S. Ct. at 853 (“[T]he Act does not\n\ncommand that any person be hired simply because . . . he is a member of a\n\nminority group. . . . What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial,\n\narbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate\n\ninvidiously to discriminate.”); id. at 431, 91 S. Ct. at 853 (“[T]ests or criteria for\n\nemployment or promotion may not provide equality of opportunity merely in the\n\nsense of the fabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox. On the contrary,\n\n\n\n\n          So have other courts. See El v. Se. Pa. Transp. Auth. (SEPTA), 479 F.3d 232, 239 (3d\nCir. 2007) (“Griggs . . . dealt with aptitude tests administered by an employer in making hiring\ndecisions.”); Harper v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 525 F.2d 409, 411–12 (8th Cir. 1975) (“In\nGriggs, the Court struck down an employer’s use of certain aptitude tests when they were shown\n. . . to have engendered discriminatory treatment concerning the hiring and transfer of blacks.”).\n\n                                                62\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 63 of 76\n\n\nCongress has now required that the posture and condition of the job-seeker be\n\ntaken into account.”).\n\n      The majority’s reading of Griggs ignores its reasoning. Griggs explained\n\nthat disparate impact liability ensures that employers can’t use subtle forms of\n\ndiscrimination that “‘freeze’ the status quo,” create “artificial, arbitrary, and\n\nunnecessary barriers to employment,” or “operate as ‘built-in-headwinds’ for\n\nminority groups.” 401 U.S. at 430–32, 91 S. Ct. at 853–54. But under the\n\nmajority’s reading of Griggs, Duke Power, the employer, was welcome to “‘freeze’\n\nthe status quo” and create all the “artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to\n\nemployment” it wanted by not hiring minorities at all. We know this is wrong.\n\nAfter deciding Griggs, the Supreme Court sent the case back to the District Court,\n\nwhich enjoined the use of discriminatory tests “as a condition of consideration for\n\nemployment or promotion or transfer.” Griggs v. Duke Power Co., No. 210-G-66,\n\n1972 WL 215, at *1 (M.D.N.C. Sept. 25, 1972).\n\n                                           C.\n\n      The next reason I would allow Mr. Villarreal’s claim to proceed is Smith v.\n\nCity of Jackson, the Supreme Court’s most recent opinion that interprets § 4(a)(2).\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning, Smith held that § 4(a)(2) allows disparate impact\n\nclaims. Four Justices reached this result based on the plain text, though they also\n\ncited an EEOC regulation as evidence that “the agency charged by Congress with\n\n                                           63\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 64 of 76\n\n\nresponsibility for implementing the statute, 29 U.S.C. § 628, ha[s] consistently\n\ninterpreted” § 4(a)(2) in the same way. Smith, 544 U.S. at 239, 125 S. Ct. at 1544\n\n(plurality opinion). The plurality recognized that the regulation it was citing never\n\n“mention[ed] disparate impact by name” and never purported to interpret § 4(a)(2).\n\nId. 7 But the plurality nonetheless said this regulation “set[] forth the standards for\n\na disparate-impact claim.” Id. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at 1544. Justice Scalia (who\n\nadded the fifth vote) went further, declaring that the EEOC’s regulation made\n\nSmith “an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.” Id. at\n\n243, 125 S. Ct. at 1546 (Scalia, J., concurring in part).\n\n       When comparing § 4(a)(1) and § 4(a)(2), the Smith plurality pointed to\n\ndistinctions between employer motives and discriminatory effects as the “key\n\ntextual differences” between those subsections. Id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542\n\nn.6. In doing so, the plurality said nothing about the distinction between hiring\n\nversus other claims that the majority’s entire effort to distinguish Smith is staked\n\non.8 The plurality even cited two ADEA cases brought by job applicants in\n\n\n       7\n         Indeed that regulation simply said: “When an employment practice, including a test, is\nclaimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the\ngrounds that it is a ‘factor other than’ age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on\nindividuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.” 29\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(d) (2004).\n       8\n          Judge Rosenbaum’s concurrence points out that the Smith plurality recognized that the\ndifference in the text of the ADEA and Title VII could warrant treating disparate impact claims\nunder the two statutes differently. This is true. But the plurality was specifically talking about\n§ 4(f)(1) of the ADEA, which contains language that significantly narrows its coverage by\n                                                64\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 65 of 76\n\n\nsupport of its statement that “for over two decades after our decision in Griggs, the\n\nCourts of Appeals uniformly interpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a\n\n‘disparate-impact’ theory in appropriate cases.” Id. at 236–37 & n.8, 125 S. Ct. at\n\n1542–43 & n.8 (citing Wooden v. Bd. of Educ. of Jefferson Cty., 931 F.2d 376\n\n(6th Cir. 1991), and Faulkner v. Super Valu Stores, Inc., 3 F.3d 1419 (10th Cir.\n\n1993)). If those were “appropriate” disparate impact cases, so is Mr. Villarreal’s.\n\n                                               D.\n\n       Eleven judges interpret § 4(a)(2) in today’s ruling. Among the eleven of us,\n\nwe read the statute to mean at least three different things. While each of us feels\n\ncertain about the correctness of our own reading, we can’t all be absolutely right.\n\nAnd where a statute can be variously interpreted (or in the vernacular, is\n\n“ambiguous”), courts must defer to the interpretation given by the agency charged\n\nwith enforcing the statute. This is one more reason § 4(a)(2) must be read to\n\nprotect job applicants. It is because the EEOC has always read the ADEA to\n\nprotect them. And “it is axiomatic that the EEOC’s interpretation of [the ADEA],\n\nfor which it has primary enforcement responsibility, need . . . only be reasonable to\n\n\npermitting “otherwise prohibited” action “where the differentiation is based on reasonable\nfactors other than age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1). Title VII includes no such language. For that\nreason, I don’t think you can travel too far on Smith’s observation that “the scope of disparate-\nimpact liability under ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.” Id. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at 1544.\nAnd because I understand Judge Rosenbaum and I to agree that Smith did not explicitly address\nwhether § 4(a)(2) provides for a disparate-impact claim in the context of hiring decisions, this\nobservation does not resolve the question before us.\n\n                                                65\n\f                Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 66 of 76\n\n\nbe entitled to deference.” EEOC v. Comm. Office Prods. Co., 486 U.S. 107, 115,\n\n108 S. Ct. 1666, 1671 (1988).9\n\n       The EEOC’s ADEA disparate impact rule, which was issued through notice-\n\nand-comment rulemaking, confirms that § 4(a)(2) protects applicants. See 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(c). And a preamble section titled “Benefits of the Rule” uses the\n\nEEOC’s data on hiring discrimination to explain how the rule addresses “neutral\n\npractices that act as barriers to the employment of older workers”:\n\n       Data show that older individuals who become unemployed have more\n       difficulty finding a new position and tend to stay unemployed longer\n       than younger individuals. To the extent that the difficulty in finding\n       new work is attributable to neutral practices that act as barriers to the\n       employment of older workers, the regulation should help to reduce the\n       rate of their unemployment.\n\n       9\n          Related to this point, RJ Reynolds and its amici list various policy arguments in support\nof their view. The majority did right by choosing not to indulge these arguments. Policy choices\nbelong to Congress and to agencies, not courts. See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v. Brand\nX Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967, 980, 125 S. Ct. 2688, 2699 (2005). Still, because some of these\narguments might reappear in later litigation, I point out that they seem quite specious. RJ\nReynolds and its amici first warn that disparate impact liability for hiring criteria will end efforts\nto recruit recent graduates. But the statute prohibits “limit[ing]” employees, and recruitment\ndoes nothing to “limit” anyone. Instead it expands who will apply for a job. Also, among the\nrecruitment programs that RJ Reynolds’s amici claims are under threat are initiatives to target\nminority graduates. If those programs violate the ADEA, then they would have had to violate\nTitle VII too. But they don’t.\n        RJ Reynolds’s amici next argue that age discrimination doesn’t require disparate impact,\nsince all older workers were once young, so they didn’t face a lifetime (let alone generations) of\nprejudice as with race discrimination. The underlying point about race discrimination is a good\none. “[T]he persistence of racial inequality” requires effort “to counteract discrimination’s\nlingering effects. Those effects, reflective of a system of racial caste only recently ended, are\nevident in our workplaces.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 273, 115 S. Ct.\n2097, 2135 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citation omitted); see also Derrick Bell, Faces at\nthe Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism (1992). But this argument should be\nrecognized for what it is: an attempt to re-litigate Smith. Smith says the ADEA imposes\ndisparate impact liability for age discrimination. The question in Mr. Villarreal’s case is whether\nprotection from the disparate impact of age discrimination extends to job applicants.\n                                                 66\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 67 of 76\n\n\n\n\n77 Fed. Reg. 19080, 19092 (2012) (footnote omitted). This satisfies “the basic\n\nprocedural requirement[] of administrative rulemaking [] that an agency must give\n\nadequate reasons for its decisions.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, __ U.S.\n\n__, __, 136 S. Ct. 2112, 2127 (2016); see also id. (“The agency must examine the\n\nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action including a\n\nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” (quotation\n\nomitted)).\n\n      The EEOC has always held this same view. The EEOC first said so through\n\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in 1981. See 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(d) (1981). That\n\n“regulation affirmed . . . the longstanding position of the Department of Labor, the\n\nagency that previously administered the ADEA.” Smith, 544 U.S. at 244, 125 S.\n\nCt. at 1547 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). Indeed, as early as 1968, months after\n\nthe ADEA was signed into law, the Department of Labor (“which initially drafted\n\nthe legislation,” id. at 239, 125 S. Ct. at 1544 (plurality opinion)) declared that\n\nsupposedly neutral “pre-employment” tests must be “reasonably necessary for the\n\nspecific work to be performed” and “equally applied to all applicants.” 33 Fed.\n\nReg. 9173 (1968) (emphasis added); Smith, 544 U.S. at 239, 125 S. Ct. at 1544\n\n(plurality opinion) (citing these “initial regulations” as evidence of the agency’s\n\nlongstanding view). And the EEOC explained the interpretative basis for that rule\n\n\n\n                                           67\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016      Page: 68 of 76\n\n\nto the Supreme Court over two decades ago. 10 But the majority adopts the view\n\nthat the governing agency responsible for protecting against age discrimination has\n\nread the statute wrong for nearly half a century.\n\n                                        *      *       *\n\n       The majority opinion never explains why Congress chose the words\n\n“deprive any individual of employment opportunities” for § 4(a)(2). Surely\n\nCongress chose those words because it meant “deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities” not “deprive [employees] of employment\n\nopportunities.” The agency charged with enforcing the ADEA agrees. That\n\nshould be the end of that.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       The majority’s second holding may be even more harmful than its first. Mr.\n\nVillarreal says he “had no knowledge and no reason or means to know” about RJ\n\nReynolds’s secret elimination of older workers from the hiring pool until just\n\nbefore he filed his EEOC charge. The majority holds that Mr. Villarreal’s\n\nequitable tolling claim cannot even survive a motion to dismiss because he did not\n\n       10\n           See Petition for a Writ of Certiorari at 12–13, EEOC v. Francis W. Parker Sch., 515\nU.S. 1142 (1995) (No. 94-1558), 1995 WL 17047545 (“The court of appeals . . . reasoned that . .\n. [§] 4(a)(2) protects only incumbent employees. That reasoning is seriously flawed. By its\nexpress terms, [§] 4(a)(2) is not limited to protecting incumbent employees. Although [§] 4(a)(2)\nmakes it unlawful for an employer ‘to limit, segregate, or classify his employees,’ the employer\nmay not engage in such conduct ‘in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\nindividual of employment opportunities.’ The use of the term ‘individual’ rather than ‘employee’\nindicates that [§] 4(a)(2) protects applicants for employment.” (citation omitted)).\n\n                                               68\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 69 of 76\n\n\ntry to uncover the secret policy earlier. Part of why this holding is so troubling is\n\nthat it applies beyond the ADEA and beyond disparate impact claims. For\n\nexample, suppose an employer intentionally screens out all black job applicants.\n\nNo applicant would suspect that such odious discrimination was the reason he\n\ndidn’t get a job, especially if he filled out a standard online application (like Mr.\n\nVillarreal did) or applied for dozens or hundreds of jobs (like many job seekers\n\ndo). No reasonable applicant would assume that all those employers acted\n\nunlawfully or accuse all of them of discrimination.\n\n      Even when a job-seeker has a nagging suspicion that he has been passed\n\nover because of his age, it generally takes more than just suspicion to accuse an\n\nemployer of something so wrong. And on the rare occasion when a job applicant\n\ndares to bring up the subject, all employers are not likely to confess to illegal\n\nconduct. Some might. But Mr. Villarreal’s case comes to us on a motion to\n\ndismiss, which means we are setting the baseline for every one of these cases. Our\n\nprecedent until now has recognized that, “[s]ecret preferences in hiring and even\n\nmore subtle means of illegal discrimination, because of their very nature, are\n\nunlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated against.” Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 931. Recognizing the difficulty in uncovering this type of discrimination,\n\nour precedent protects against, for example, an employer who screens out every\n\nblack applicant and keeps this misconduct secret until the statute of limitations\n\n                                           69\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 70 of 76\n\n\nperiod has run. Under the majority’s new rule, even if an insider came forward\n\nlater to exposes this bad conduct, the victim could not benefit from the\n\nextraordinary revelation. This change upsets over forty years of Fifth and Eleventh\n\nCircuit precedent.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      The diligence required for equitable tolling is reasonable diligence. And it\n\nisn’t reasonable for every single job applicant to assume she was discriminated\n\nagainst. The Supreme Court’s equitable tolling cases confirm this. The last time\n\nthe Supreme Court confirmed that Title VII’s limitations period “is subject to\n\nequitable doctrines such as tolling,” the Court’s unanimous opinion listed various\n\n“circumstances where it will be difficult to determine when the time period should\n\nbegin to run.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 108, 114 n. 7,\n\n122 S. Ct. 2061, 2073 n.7 (2002). For example, Justice Thomas wrote, “[o]ne\n\nissue that may arise in such circumstances is whether the time begins to run when\n\nthe injury occurs as opposed to when the injury reasonably should have been\n\ndiscovered.” Id. But the Court concluded that the victim in that case “believed\n\nthat he was being discriminated against at the time that all [the discriminatory] acts\n\noccurred.” Id. (quotation omitted). For that reason, the Court ruled that the\n\nlimitations period was not tolled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 71 of 76\n\n\n      The equitable tolling cases the Supreme Court decided before Morgan also\n\ntouched on this idea of notice. See Irwin v. Dep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S.\n\n89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 458 (1990) (denying equitable tolling for a plaintiff who\n\nwaited too long to sue after alleging the same discrimination in an EEOC charge);\n\nBaldwin Cty. Welcome Ctr. v. Brown, 466 U.S. 147, 151, 104 S. Ct. 1723, 1725\n\n(1984) (“This is not a case in which a claimant has received inadequate notice”). It\n\nis true that some equitable tolling cases don’t analyze notice in the same way, at\n\nleast not expressly. But those cases all address overt government deprivations,\n\nsuch as a denied social security claim, a breach of contract by the government, or a\n\nruling on a criminal conviction. In this type of case, notice can be assumed. For\n\nexample, a habeas petitioner can be assumed to have known about the ruling she is\n\nchallenging from the moment the ruling issued. Indeed the only way she wouldn’t\n\nknow is through something extraordinary, like deception or lawyer misconduct or\n\nabandonment. The same isn’t true for “[s]ecret preferences in hiring.” Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 931. In these cases, “subtle means of illegal discrimination, because of\n\ntheir very nature, are unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated\n\nagainst.” Id. (emphasis added). That’s why our court has always equitably tolled\n\nthe limitations period for these claims “until the facts which would support a cause\n\nof action are apparent or should be apparent.” Id. at 930.\n\n\n\n\n                                          71\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 72 of 76\n\n\n      The majority says Reeb is not relevant here because “that decision involved\n\nactive deception by the employer.” Maj. Op. at 28. But our court has always said\n\n“equitable tolling does not require employer misconduct.” Cocke v. Merrill Lynch\n\n& Co., 817 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir. 1987). Also, Reeb did not turn on the\n\nemployer’s deception. To the contrary, Judge Wisdom wrote that discriminatory\n\nhiring preferences tend to stay hidden “because of their very nature.” 516 F.3d at\n\n931. Beyond that, any question about whether Reeb requires deception was\n\nresolved in Tucker v. UPS, 657 F.2d 724 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). The Tucker\n\nplaintiffs filed an EEOC charge more than 180 days after they were fired but less\n\nthan 180 days after they learned that this firing might have been discriminatory.\n\nThe plaintiffs weren’t misled, but the court allowed equitable tolling based on\n\nReeb. Chief Judge Godbold made the same point I make today:\n\n      The ‘prudent person’ requirement of Reeb is not triggered by a\n      seasonal black employee’s being notified of an otherwise\n      unexceptional decision that he is not going to be recalled. It would be\n      anomalous indeed if persons protected by the statute from racial\n      discrimination are required to presume that they are being\n      discriminated against.\n\nId. at 726. The same is true for Mr. Villarreal. He was not “required to presume”\n\ndiscrimination from the “otherwise unexceptional” fact that he didn’t get a job\n\noffer. Id.\n\n      Other courts have come to adopt the Reeb test too. Indeed, this court once\n\ncalled Reeb’s notice requirement “a pronouncement that would be echoed by\n                                         72\n\f               Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 73 of 76\n\n\nvarious circuits across the country.” Jones v. Dillard’s, Inc., 331 F.3d 1259, 1264\n\n(11th Cir. 2003). Now the majority characterizes that the Second, Seventh, and\n\nD.C. Circuits courts as using a “general test” and says Mr. Villarreal has asked for\n\na “special test.” Maj. Op. at 26. These vague labels do more to confuse than\n\nclarify. The fact is that all three of the courts the majority references cited Reeb to\n\nhold that a plaintiff’s lack of notice about employment discrimination is an\n\n“extraordinary circumstance” that warrants equitable tolling. 11 So have at least\n\nthree others. 12 No court has ever criticized the Reeb test. It is the test I would\n\napply here.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Under the majority’s new rule, no discrimination victim can get equitable\n\ntolling unless he assumes he was discriminated against, no matter how\n       11\n          See Miller v. Int’l Tel. Corp., 755 F.2d 20, 24 (2d Cir. 1985) (“An ‘extraordinary’\ncircumstance permitting tolling of the time bar on equitable grounds might exist if the employee\ncould show that it would have been impossible for a reasonably prudent person to learn that his\ndischarge was discriminatory.”); Vaught v.

Diebold, Inc., 33 F.3d 674, 676 (6th Cir. 1994). Though the Eighth and\nNinth Circuits have never cited Reeb, they apply this same standard. See Dring v. McDonnell\nDouglas Corp., 58 F.3d 1323, 1329 (8th Cir. 1995) (“[W]hen a reasonable person in the\nplaintiff’s situation would not be expected to know of the existence of a possible ADEA\nviolation, this excusable ignorance may provide the basis for the proper invocation of the\ndoctrine of equitable tolling.”); Boyd v. U.S. Postal Serv., 752 F.2d 410, 414 (9th Cir. 1985)\n(“The time period for filing a complaint of discrimination begins to run when the facts that\nwould support a charge of discrimination would have been apparent to a similarly situated person\nwith a reasonably prudent regard for his rights.”).\n\n                                              73\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 74 of 76\n\n\nunreasonable that assumption might be. I believe “this standard is too rigid.”\n\nHolland v. Florida, 560 U.S. 631, 634, 130 S. Ct. 2549, 2254 (2010). When\n\nHolland overruled our court’s equitable tolling standard, the Supreme Court\n\ninstructed that\n\n      the “exercise of a court’s equity powers must be made on a case-by-\n      case basis.” . . . . The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable procedure”\n      enables courts “to meet new situations that demand equitable\n      intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to correct particular\n      injustices.” . . . Such courts exercise judgment . . . with awareness\n      of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict in\n      advance, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.\n\nId. at 649–50, 130 S. Ct. at 2563 (citations omitted) (alterations adopted). After\n\nHolland, we finally recognized that “[e]quitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature,\n\nand decisions regarding it must be made ‘on a case-by-case basis’ in light of\n\n‘specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance.’” Hutchinson v. Florida,\n\n677 F.3d 1097, 1098 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563). The\n\nmajority ignores that lesson here.\n\n      Worse, the majority’s rigid test makes little sense. The majority says Mr.\n\nVillarreal’s case needed to be dismissed because he didn’t “investigate the status of\n\nhis application.” Maj. Op. at 29. The majority never explains why this distinction\n\nmatters. Even if Mr. Villarreal learned that his application had been rejected, that\n\nwould reveal nothing about whether the rejection was discriminatory. Neither\n\nwould an inquiry from Mr. Villarreal about the status of his application have made\n\n                                          74\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 75 of 76\n\n\nany difference to RJ Reynolds. Job applicants follow up on their applications all\n\nthe time. That routine occurrence does not give notice to the employer that a\n\ndiscrimination charge is coming. Mr. Villarreal’s complaint said he filed an EEOC\n\ncharge as soon as he learned that RJ Reynolds used illegal hiring criteria to reject\n\nhis application. And he claims he could not have learned about that secret conduct\n\nearlier. This is enough, in my view, to survive a motion to dismiss his case on the\n\npleadings.\n\n      I don’t dispute that equitable tolling requires plaintiffs to act diligently. But\n\nthe requirement has always been reasonable diligence. I see no basis to conclude\n\nthat Mr. Villarreal acted unreasonably here. In fact, RJ Reynolds and its amici\n\nexpressly ask us to speculate about facts that are not in the record. RJ Reynolds\n\nsays Mr. Villarreal’s actions were unreasonable because he “did not even try to\n\ninquire about his application. If he had, RJ Reynolds would have told him that it\n\nwas seeking entry-level salesmen with less experience.” And the Chamber of\n\nCommerce adds that Mr. Villarreal could have looked up whether the people RJ\n\nReynolds hired created profiles on the social networking website LinkedIn and\n\nthen researched the ages of those people somewhere else. But this appeal comes to\n\nus on a motion to dismiss. That means we can’t assume anything about what RJ\n\nReynolds “would have” said. And we certainly can’t know if using LinkedIn to\n\nbuild a cause of action would have been either reasonably prudent or at all fruitful.\n\n                                          75\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 76 of 76\n\n\nOne thing we can know however is that “subtle means of illegal discrimination,\n\nbecause of their very nature, are unlikely to be readily apparent.” Reeb, 516 F.3d\n\nat 931.\n\n      Employers who act illegally should not escape liability just because their\n\nconduct was hidden through the end of the limitations period. In cases where\n\nillegal conduct is exposed after the limitations period, I would allow discovery on\n\nthe question our court has always asked in these cases: when did the “facts which\n\nwould support a cause of action [become] apparent . . . to a person with a\n\nreasonably prudent regard for his rights”? Id. at 930. If discovery is limited to that\n\nquestion, the burden on defendants will be minimal. On that note, it’s worth\n\nremembering that equitable doctrines arise out of concern for the circumstances of\n\nboth sides of a case. If RJ Reynolds showed that Mr. Villarreal’s delay was\n\nprejudicial in some way (such as due to lost evidence), a court would have to take\n\nthat into account. But that never happened here. Instead, the majority says delay\n\nis always unacceptable, even if a victim had zero reason to act earlier. The\n\nSupreme Court held six years ago that this court’s equitable tolling “standard is too\n\nrigid.” Holland, 560 U.S. at 634, 130 S. Ct. at 2554. The majority’s new rule\n\nreturns us down that path.\n\n\n\n\n                                          76\n\f",

Richard Villarreal\n\nsued R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Pinstripe, Inc. for rejecting his job\n\napplications. All parties agree that Villarreal, as an applicant for employment, can\n\nsue for disparate treatment because the Act prohibits an employer from “fail[ing]\n\nor refus[ing] to hire . . . any individual . . . because of such individual’s age.” 29\n\nU.S.C. § 623(a)(1). But Villarreal and the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission, as amicus curiae, argue that an applicant can also sue an employer\n\nfor disparate impact because the Act prohibits an employer from “limit[ing],\n\nsegregat[ing], or classify[ing] his employees in any way which would deprive or\n\ntend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\n\naffect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” Id. § 623(a)(2).\n\nWe conclude that the whole text of the Act makes clear that an applicant for\n\nemployment cannot sue an employer for disparate impact because the applicant has\n\nno “status as an employee.” Id. And we conclude that Villarreal is not entitled to\n\nequitable tolling of his claim of disparate treatment because he admitted facts that\n\nestablish that he did not diligently pursue his rights. We affirm in part and remand\n\nfor the panel to address the remaining issue about whether the continuing-violation\n\ndoctrine makes Villarreal’s claim of disparate treatment timely.\n\n                                            2\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 3 of 76\n\n\n                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n      On November 8, 2007, Villarreal applied for a position as a territory\n\nmanager at R.J. Reynolds. He was 49 years old. Using guidelines provided by R.J.\n\nReynolds, a contractor screened out Villarreal’s application. The guidelines\n\ndescribed the “targeted candidate” as someone “2–3 years out of college” who\n\n“adjusts easily to changes” and instructed the contractor to “stay away from”\n\napplicants “in sales for 8–10 years.” Neither the contractor nor R.J. Reynolds told\n\nVillarreal that he had been rejected, and Villarreal did not follow up.\n\n      Over two years later, in April 2010, lawyers contacted Villarreal and told\n\nhim that R.J. Reynolds had discriminated against him on the basis of his age. In\n\nMay 2010, Villarreal filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission. Villarreal also applied to R.J. Reynolds five more times in the next\n\ntwo years and was rejected every time. He amended his charge to include these\n\nrejections and to add Pinstripe, which replaced the first contractor, as a respondent.\n\n      In April 2012, the Commission issued notices of right to sue with respect to\n\nR.J. Reynolds and Pinstripe. Villarreal brought a collective action against R.J.\n\nReynolds and Pinstripe under the Act on behalf of “all applicants for the Territory\n\nManager position who applied for the position since the date RJ Reynolds began its\n\npattern or practice of discriminating against applicants over the age of 40 . . . ; who\n\nwere 40 years of age or older at the time of their application; and who were\n\n\n                                           3\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 4 of 76\n\n\nrejected for the position.” The complaint alleged two counts: disparate treatment\n\nunder section 4(a)(1) of the Act and disparate impact under section 4(a)(2) of the\n\nAct.\n\n       In anticipation of an objection of untimeliness, Villarreal also alleged facts\n\nto support equitable tolling of the limitations period that governed his complaint.\n\nHe alleged that “he did not become aware until shortly before filing the charge that\n\nthere was reason to believe that his 2007 application for the Territory Manager\n\nposition had been rejected on account of his age.” He also alleged that “[t]he facts\n\nnecessary to support [his] charge of discrimination were not apparent to him, and\n\ncould not have been apparent to him, until less than a month before he filed his\n\nMay 17, 2010 EEOC charge.”\n\n       R.J. Reynolds and Pinstripe moved to dismiss Villarreal’s complaint in part.\n\nThey moved to dismiss the disparate-impact count on the ground that section\n\n4(a)(2) does not give a cause of action to applicants, and they moved to dismiss as\n\nuntimely the parts of both counts based on the 2007 application. The district court\n\ndismissed the disparate-impact count and the untimely parts of both counts.\n\n       When Villarreal later moved for leave to amend the complaint, he alleged in\n\nhis proposed amended complaint that he “was not an employee of . . . R.J.\n\nReynolds . . . or related to anyone who was,” that he “did not receive any\n\ncommunication from RJ Reynolds or anyone else informing him why he was not\n\n                                           4\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 5 of 76\n\n\nhired,” that he “did not even know whether his application had been reviewed at\n\nall,” and that he was unaware of the screening guidelines. The district court denied\n\nleave to amend the complaint on the ground that amendment would be futile. It\n\nexplained that Villarreal “has not alleged any misrepresentations or concealment\n\nthat hindered [him] from learning of any alleged discrimination,” that he “made no\n\nattempt to contact [R.J. Reynolds] and ascertain the basis for his application\n\nrejection,” and that he “has not alleged any due diligence on his part.” Villarreal\n\nlater moved to dismiss the remaining parts of the complaint, and the district court\n\ndismissed them with prejudice.\n\n      A divided panel of this Court reversed.

DISCUSSION\n\n      We divide our discussion in two parts. First, we explain that Villarreal failed\n\nto state a claim under section 4(a)(2) because he was a job applicant, not an\n\nemployee of R.J. Reynolds. Second, we explain that Villarreal is not entitled to\n\nequitable tolling because he admits facts that disprove diligence.\n\n            A. Villarreal Failed to State a Claim Under Section 4(a)(2).\n      Section 4(a)(2) of the Act makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 623(a)(2). We consider not only the text of section 4(a)(2) itself, but also the\n\nstatutory context in sections 4(c)(2) and 4(a)(1). See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.\n\nGarner, Reading Law 167 (2012) (“The text must be construed as a whole.”); id. at\n\n170 (“A word or phrase is presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text; a\n\nmaterial variation in terms suggests a variation in meaning.”); Robinson v.

The\n\nplain text of section 4(a)(2) covers discrimination against employees. It does not\n\ncover applicants for employment.\n\n       The key phrase in section 4(a)(2) is “or otherwise adversely affect his status\n\nas an employee.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). By using “or otherwise” to join the verbs\n\nin this section, Congress made “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual\n\nof employment opportunities” a subset of “adversely affect[ing] [the individual’s]\n\nstatus as an employee.” Id. In other words, section 4(a)(2) protects an individual\n\nonly if he has a “status as an employee.” Id.\n\n       This use of “or otherwise” to connect verbs is a familiar construction. For\n\nexample, Congress allows the use of funds to extradite a United States citizen “to a\n\nforeign country that is under an obligation to surrender persons to the International\n\n                                             7\n\f              Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 8 of 76\n\n\nCriminal Court” if there are “satisfactory assurances to the United States that the\n\ncountry will not extradite or otherwise transfer that citizen to the International\n\nCriminal Court.” 22 U.S.C. § 7402(a). As we understand that “extradite” is a\n\nsubset of “transfer” in this statute, we also understand that “deprive or tend to\n\ndeprive any individual of employment opportunities” is a subset of “adversely\n\naffect his status as an employee” in section 4(a)(2). Other examples abound. See,\n\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2345(b) (“inhibit or otherwise affect”); 25 U.S.C. § 1728(c)\n\n(“considered as income or resources or otherwise utilized”); 33 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1518(a)(3) (“call at or otherwise utilize a deepwater port”). Even our own\n\nprocedural rules use this construction. For example, a single judge of our Court\n\n“may not dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding.” Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 27(c); see also 11th Cir. R. 27-1(d) (same); 11th Cir. R. 41-1(a) (“shows\n\nthat a substantial question is to be presented to the Supreme Court or otherwise sets\n\nforth good cause for a stay”); 11th Cir. R. 42-1(b) (“fails to file a brief or other\n\nrequired papers within the time permitted, or otherwise fails to comply with the\n\napplicable rules” and “file documents out of time or otherwise remedy the\n\ndefault”). In each of these examples, the first action is a subset of the second\n\naction. So too is “deprive or tend to deprive” a subset of “adversely affect” in\n\nsection 4(a)(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 9 of 76\n\n\n      Villarreal cites a contrary interpretation of the phrase “or otherwise” in Rine\n\nv. Imagitas, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78521\"><a href=\"/opinion/78521/rine-v-imagitas-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">590</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2009), but we reject the reasoning in\n\nthat opinion. The statute at issue in Rine made it unlawful to “knowingly disclose\n\nor otherwise make available” certain personal information. 18 U.S.C. § 2721(a).\n\nThe panel wrote that the use of the disjunctive “or” “indicates alternatives and\n\nrequires that those alternatives be treated separately.” Rine, 590 F.3d at 1224\n\n(quoting Brown v. Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"72013\"><a href=\"/opinion/72013/brown-v-budget-rent-a-car-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 924 (11th Cir.\n\n1997)).

Judge Martin’s\n\ninterpretation, which treats “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n\nemployee” and “deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” as separate categories, does not give effect to every word because it\n\nreads “otherwise” out of the statute.\n\n      By making “deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” a subset of “adversely affect[ing] his status as an employee,”\n\nCongress limited section 4(a)(2) to discrimination against employees. Applicants\n\nwho are not employees when alleged discrimination occurs do not have a “status as\n\nan employee.” Dictionaries confirm that the phrase “status as an employee”\n\nconnotes a present fact. The Oxford English Dictionary primarily defines “status”\n\nin the legal context to mean “[t]he fact or position of belonging to a group which is\n\nsubject to certain legal rights or limitations,” and it provides usage notes ranging\n\nfrom 1767 to 2002.

But Santos states that an alien can attain status as a permanent resident only\n\nafter undergoing an application process, not that he had that status during the\n\napplication process. See Santos, 375 F.2d at 263 (noting an alien can apply for\n\n“adjustment of status from non-immigrant to permanent resident”).\n\n      Statutory context confirms our reading of section 4(a)(2). Section 4(c)(2)\n\napplies to applicants as well as employees only because it adds the words “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” to a provision that is otherwise largely parallel to\n\nsection 4(a)(2):\n\n      It shall be unlawful for a labor organization . . .\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify its membership, or to classify or\n             fail or refuse to refer for employment any individual, in any\n             way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n             employment opportunities, or would limit such employment\n             opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n             employee or as an applicant for employment, because of such\n             individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(c) (emphasis added).

And because\n\n“[a] word or phrase is presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text” and\n\n“a material variation in terms suggests a variation in meaning,” id. at 170, the term\n\n“employee” and the phrase “deprive or tend to deprive any individual . . . or\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee” in section 4(a)(2) do not\n\nencompass an applicant for employment.\n\n      In her dissent, Judge Martin responds that section 4(c)(2) mentions\n\napplicants because it, unlike section 4(a)(2), covers failures to “refer” someone for\n\nemployment, Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 10–12, but this argument does not\n\nline up with Judge Martin’s interpretation of section 4(a)(2). If “any individual”\n\nalways includes applicants, see id. at 8–9, and applicants can have their “status as\n\nan employee” adversely affected, see id. at 5–7, then Congress had no need to\n\nmention applicants in section 4(c)(2). The statute would mean the exact same\n\nthing, under Judge Martin’s interpretation, if the words “or as an applicant for\n\nemployment” were deleted. But that interpretation violates the surplusage canon.\n\nSee Scalia & Garner, supra, at 174.\n\n      We also contrast the text of section 4(a)(2) with the text of section 4(a)(1),\n\nwhich does cover applicants. Section 4(a)(1) makes it unlawful for employers “to\n\nfail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n\n                                         15\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 16 of 76\n\n\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). Unlike section 4(a)(1), section 4(a)(2) does not\n\nmention an employer refusing to hire someone. And unlike section 4(a)(2), section\n\n4(a)(1) says nothing about a “status as an employee.”\n\n      According to Judge Martin’s dissent, a plurality of the Supreme Court has\n\ndescribed “the ‘key textual differences’ between” sections 4(a)(1) and 4(a)(2) and,\n\nin so doing, said nothing about claims of disparate impact in hiring, Dissenting Op.\n\nof Martin, J., at 16 (quoting Smith v.

See Smith, 544\n\nU.S. at 236 n.6 (plurality op.) (“JUSTICE O’CONNOR ignores key textual differences\n\nbetween § 4(a)(1) . . . and § 4(a)(2).”). Indeed, in the very same paragraph, the\n\nplurality described section 4(a)(2) as a provision that covers employees. See id.\n\n(“[A]n employer who classifies his employees without respect to age may still be\n\nliable under the terms of [section 4(a)(2)] if such classification adversely affects\n\nthe employee because of that employee’s age . . . .” (emphases added)).\n\n      Villarreal argues, based on a different section of the Act, that “employee” in\n\nsection 4(a)(2) means something other than employee, but his argument fails.\n\nSection 7(c)(1) creates a cause of action for “[a]ny person aggrieved” and provides\n\n                                           16\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 17 of 76\n\n\nthat the right of action “shall terminate upon the commencement of an action by\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce the right of such\n\nemployee under this chapter.” Id. § 626(c)(1) (emphasis added). Villarreal asserts\n\nthat by equating “person” and “employee” in section 7(c)(1), Congress expanded\n\n“employee” to mean “any individual” in section 4(a)(2). But the statute defines\n\n“employee” as “an individual employed by any employer,” id. § 630(f), which is\n\nalso the common meaning of “employee.” “It is very rare that a defined meaning\n\ncan be replaced with another permissible meaning of the word on the basis of other\n\ntextual indications; the definition is virtually conclusive.” Scalia & Garner, supra,\n\nat 228. Section 7(c)(1) does not create ambiguity about the meaning of “employee”\n\nin section 4(a)(2).\n\n      Villarreal’s other arguments that “employee” does not mean employee are\n\neven easier to reject. Villarreal cites Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., which held that a\n\nprohibition on retaliation against employees in Title VII extended to former\n\nemployees because of statutory context. See 519 U.S. at 345–46. But the Supreme\n\nCourt did not interpret employee to mean job applicant in Robinson, and the\n\nstatutory context in this appeal—specifically, sections 4(c)(2) and 4(a)(1)—\n\nsuggests that they are different. Judge Martin’s dissenting opinion adds that the\n\ndefinition of “employment agency” in Title VII uses “employees” to mean\n\n“prospective employees,” Dissenting Op. of Martin, J., at 7–8 (quoting Robinson,\n\n                                          17\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 18 of 76\n\n\n519 U.S. at 343 n.3), but the language of that provision is nothing like the language\n\nin section 4(a)(2), see 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(c) (defining “employment agency” as\n\n“any person regularly undertaking with or without compensation to procure\n\nemployees for an employer or to procure for employees opportunities to work for\n\nan employer and includes an agent of such a person”). Villarreal also cites section\n\n201 of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, id.\n\n§ 2000ff(2)(A)(i), which defines “employee” to include “applicant.” But the\n\napplicable definition in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act does not\n\ninclude “applicant.” See 29 U.S.C. § 630(f).\n\n      Villarreal tries to circumvent the plain meaning of the statute by citing\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court that interpret similar language in other statutes, but\n\nthose decisions do not support his argument.

Here, Villarreal did not\n\nallege or attempt to allege that R.J. Reynolds actively misled him. As a result, the\n\ngeneral test applies: a plaintiff seeking equitable tolling must prove diligence and\n\nextraordinary circumstances.\n\n      Villarreal is not entitled to equitable tolling because he admitted facts that\n\nforeclose a finding of diligence. Specifically, he alleged that he did nothing for\n\nmore than two years between his initial application and the communication from\n\nthe lawyer. Villarreal argues that any inquiry would have been futile, but even\n\nassuming that futility is an exception to the diligence requirement, it would not\n\napply when a plaintiff does nothing to investigate the status of his application, as\n\nopposed to the reasons for his rejection. We have no difficulty concluding, as a\n\nmatter of law, that a plaintiff who does nothing for two years is not diligent. Cf.\n\nAmini, 259 F.3d at 501 (concluding that a plaintiff was not diligent despite\n\n“‘regular’ computer visits to [the employer’s] website, as well as a physical visit to\n\nthe campus . . . in which [he] searched the [employer’s] announcement boards for\n\ninformation on the new hire” (citation omitted)).\n\n      In his partial dissent, Judge Jordan argues that we should not decide whether\n\nVillarreal is entitled to equitable tolling because Villarreal’s complaint and\n\nproposed amended complaint are silent as to how Villarreal learned that R.J.\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 29 of 76\n\n\nReynolds rejected his application and whether Villarreal acted diligently. This\n\nsilence, according to Judge Jordan, is “not an affirmative allegation” but an\n\n“omission” that prohibits dismissal of Villarreal’s complaint. Op. of Jordan, J.,\n\nat 4–6. We disagree.\n\n      Judge Jordan’s assertion runs counter to the record and ignores Villareal’s\n\nargument. In his proposed amended complaint, Villarreal explained that he learned\n\nabout the rejection of his application from an attorney in 2010, not by his own\n\ndiligence. See Pl.’s Proposed Am. Compl. ¶ 28 (Until 2010 “[Villarreal] did not\n\neven know whether his application had been reviewed at all, much less whether it\n\nhad been rejected or screened out.”). As a result, the district court denied\n\nVillarreal’s motion to file an amended complaint in part because Villarreal had\n\nfailed to allege “any due diligence on his part to determine the status of his 2007\n\napplication.” Villarreal has never contested that he did nothing to ascertain the\n\nstatus of his application until 2010. He neither contested his lack of diligence\n\nbefore the district court, nor has he contested it on appeal. Villarreal instead has\n\nargued that he was not required to inquire about the status of his application and\n\nexercise any due diligence. But when Villarreal chose to anticipate the affirmative\n\ndefense of equitable tolling in his complaint, he bore the burden of alleging facts to\n\nsupport that defense. And this burden required him to allege that he was diligent,\n\nsee Menominee Indian Tribe, 136 S. Ct. at 755–56, which he did not do.\n\n                                          29\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 30 of 76\n\n\n      We conclude that equitable tolling does not apply to the claim of disparate\n\ntreatment, and we affirm in part the dismissal of that claim and the denial of leave\n\nto amend the complaint. Villarreal also argued before the panel that the continuing-\n\nviolation doctrine makes the claim timely, but the panel did not address this\n\nargument. We exercise our discretion to remand this argument to the panel, and we\n\nexpress no view on the issue.\n\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n\n      We AFFIRM the dismissal of the claim of disparate impact, and we\n\nAFFIRM IN PART the dismissal of the claim of disparate treatment and the\n\ndenial of leave to amend the complaint. We REMAND to the panel to address the\n\ncontinuing-violation doctrine in the first instance.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 31 of 76\n\n\nJORDAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n      I concur in the majority’s ultimate conclusion that Mr. Villarreal cannot\n\nassert a disparate impact claim against R.J. Reynolds. But I write separately\n\nbecause I think there is another way to read 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2), one that would\n\ngive effect to each word in this provision. Although Mr. Villarreal would not\n\nbenefit from my reading of § 623(a)(2), I offer it for the consideration of others\n\nwho may be called upon to interpret the statute in the future.\n\n      At first glance, it might appear that the disparate impact provision of the\n\nADEA is fairly susceptible to two possible interpretations—i.e., one that permits\n\njob applicants to bring disparate impact claims under the ADEA and one that does\n\nnot. If that were the case, I would agree with Judge Martin that we should defer to\n\nthe views of the EEOC, particularly when its position has been consistent for over\n\nthree decades.     The problem, in my view, is that both of these possible\n\ninterpretations fail to give effect to some language in the text.\n\n      “It is our duty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a\n\nstatute.” United States v.

(strikethrough and brackets added). The dissent, for its part, reads the language\n\nas if the statute targeted the impact of an employer’s conduct toward “any\n\nindividual,” and not just “his employees”:\n\n      to limit, segregate, or classify his employees [any individual] in any\n      way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n      employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n      an employee, because of such individual’s age[.]\n\nId. (strikethrough and bracket added). In my view, both readings rewrite language\n\nin the relevant statutory text.\n\n      The statute uses “individual” twice (“any individual” and “such individual”),\n\nand it also uses “employee” twice (“his employees” and “employee”). If we are\n\ntrying to give effect to both critical terms—“his employees” and “any\n\nindividual”—the reading that makes the most sense to me is that a job applicant\n\n(“any individual”) can bring an ADEA claim under a disparate impact theory, but\n\nonly if something the employer has done vis-à-vis “his employees” violates the\n\nADEA by “limit[ing], segregat[ing] or classify[ing]” those employees.       So, if an\n\nemployer’s practice with respect to his employees violates the ADEA, and that\n\nsame practice has a disparate impact on job applicants, those applicants can sue\n\nunder § 623(a)(2).\n\n      To illustrate, imagine a scenario where a company decides to begin using\n\nquestionnaires to test its workers’ social media savvy, even though such\n\nknowledge has no bearing on the employees’ ability to perform their jobs. The\n                                           33\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 34 of 76\n\n\ncompany takes each employee’s performance on the questionnaire into account\n\nwhen it makes promotion decisions. It also distributes the questionnaire to job\n\napplicants, and uses each applicant’s performance in making hiring decisions.\n\nImagine also that the questionnaire requirement disadvantages individuals over the\n\nage of 40 in a disproportionate way. In that scenario, the employer’s conduct\n\ntowards his employees has a disparate impact on current employees as well as job\n\napplicants. And in that scenario, I think a job applicant can sue under § 623(a)(2).\n\nI recognize that reading provides only a narrow set of viable disparate impact\n\nclaims by job applicants, but it gives effect to the way § 623(a)(2) is written.\n\n      Mr. Villarreal, however, challenges only R.J. Reynolds’ hiring practices, and\n\nnot conduct that affects the company’s current employees. He therefore has not\n\nmade out a disparate impact claim under my reading of the statute, and I concur in\n\nthe judgment with respect to the disparate impact claim.\n\n      As for the equitable tolling issue, I agree with Judge Martin’s dissent. In\n\nADEA suits, the applicable limitations period begins to run once the prospective\n\nemployee knows or should know than an unlawful employment practice has been\n\ncommitted. See Hargett v.

He also alleged that he was unaware of the resume screening\n\n                                          34\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 35 of 76\n\n\npractices R.J. Reynolds used, and that R.J. Reynolds did not tell him why he had\n\nbeen rejected. The complaints are silent as to how Mr. Villarreal learned he had\n\nbeen rejected, whether he learned that R.J. Reynolds hired an individual under the\n\nage of 40 to fill the territory manager position, and when R.J. Reynolds filled the\n\nposition with a younger candidate. Without a more developed record, it is not\n\nclear to me when Mr. Villarreal should have known that an unlawful employment\n\npractice had been committed and what Mr. Villarreal did to find out. Those are\n\nfact questions.

The same is true, of course, at the motion to dismiss stage.\n\n      The majority says that Mr. Villarreal admitted facts, on the face of his\n\ncomplaints, which foreclose a finding of diligence. According to the majority, Mr.\n\nVillarreal specifically alleged that he did nothing for more than two years between\n\nhis initial application and the communication from the lawyer. See Maj.

No, this case is challenging because\n\ndespite the clarity of the statutory language, the agency charged with administering\n\nthe statute has, for nearly the past 50 years—through both Republican and\n\nDemocrat administrations—consistently construed it in a way that conflicts with\n\nwhat appears to me to be the objectively indisputable meaning of the statutory\n\nlanguage.    That fact gives me serious pause.     And so I have examined and\n\nreexamined the statutory language for ambiguity. Despite my best efforts, I am\n\nunable to find any. Since the statute is, in my view, susceptible of only a single\n\ninterpretation, as the Majority points out, we must abide by its plain meaning,\n\nwithout resorting to the administering agency’s construction.\n\n      Though I agree with the Majority on the interpretation of the ADEA, I\n\ndisagree with the Majority on the equitable-tolling issue, for the reasons expressed\n\nby both Judges Martin and Jordan. So I dissent from the Majority opinion and join\n\nthe dissents on that issue.\n\n                                         I.\n\n      By any measure, in my view, the statutory language of § 4(a)(2) of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) is unambiguous. I do not see how\n\nthe statutory language itself, the structure of the ADEA, and the historical\n\n                                        37\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 38 of 76\n\n\nsequence of amendments and proposed amendments to both the ADEA and Title\n\nVII, on which the ADEA was based, leave any other possibility. I write separately\n\nto explain why this is so.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      The Majority has already explained why the statutory language is clear. I\n\nagree with that analysis and add the following.\n\n      Section 4(a)(2) makes it “unlawful for an employer . . . to limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as\n\nan employee, because of such individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). The term\n\n“otherwise” in this statute must mean something. If not, Congress could have left\n\nit out, and the statute could have stated simply, “in any way which would deprive\n\nor tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee . . . .” And if that were the case, the phrases “in any way\n\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” and “adversely affect his status as an employee” could be read in the\n\ndisjunctive, entirely independent of each other, allowing a plaintiff to show that an\n\nemployer’s actions violated his rights either by “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive\n\n[him] of employment opportunities” or by “adversely affect[ing] his status as an\n\nemployee.”\n\n                                         38\n\f              Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 39 of 76\n\n\n      But that is not what § 4(a)(2) says. It uses the word “otherwise” to modify\n\nthe phrase “adversely affect his status as an employee.” And “otherwise” has\n\nmeaning. “Otherwise” signals that the two phrases in § 4(a)(2) cannot be entirely\n\nindependent of each other; instead, a relationship between the two phrases exists.\n\nIn that relationship, each phrase describes a mutually exclusive subset of the\n\nuniverse of actions that “adversely affect . . . status as an employee.” Together,\n\nthese two subsets compose the entirety of the universe of actions that “adversely\n\naffect . . . status as an employee.”\n\n      “Otherwise” means “[i]n another way; differently.”             Otherwise, The\n\nAmerican Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000). Because\n\n“otherwise” is an adverb that modifies “adversely affect” in this case, “otherwise\n\nadversely affect his status as an employee” refers to actions that would “adversely\n\naffect . . . status as an employee” in any way that is different from the manner in\n\nwhich “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities” would “adversely affect . . . status as an employee.” So the first\n\nphrase—“in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities”—refers to actions that limit or preclude, for example,\n\npromotion opportunities, while the second—“otherwise adversely affect . . . status\n\nas an employee”—contemplates actions that would, for instance, result in\n\ndemotions, layoffs, or terminations.\n\n                                          39\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 40 of 76\n\n\n      Because of the word “otherwise,” no other construction makes sense to me.\n\n      And since the word “otherwise” necessarily means that “depriv[ing] or\n\ntend[ing] to deprive any individual of employment opportunities” is a subset of\n\n“adversely affect[ing] . . . status as an employee,” § 4(a)(2) cannot cover disparate-\n\nincome hiring claims. “[D]epriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities” by not hiring a person who is not an employee cannot\n\n“adversely affect his status as an employee” because he has no “status as an\n\nemployee.” Instead, his status is and remains that of a non-employee.\n\n      Plus, “affect” means “[t]o have an influence on or effect a change in.”\n\nAffect, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. 2000).\n\nBut to change something, it must exist in the first place. If a person has no “status\n\nas an employee,” “depriv[ing] or tend[ing] to deprive” that person “of employment\n\nopportunities” does not change that person’s status as a non-employee; he started\n\nas a non-employee, and he remains a non-employee.\n\n      And finally, “adversely” means in a manner “[c]ontrary to one’s interests or\n\nwelfare; harmful or unfavorable.” Adverse, The American Heritage Dictionary of\n\nthe English Language (4th ed. 2000). So unfavorably changing a person’s status as\n\nan employee necessarily refers to harming that person’s status as an employee. If a\n\nperson is not an employee, there is no “status as an employee” that an employer\n\ncan harm.\n\n                                         40\n\f             Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 41 of 76\n\n\n      So the language of § 4(a)(2) is susceptible of only a single interpretation that\n\nmakes sense to me—and that interpretation does not provide for coverage of\n\ndisparate-impact hiring claims.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      The Majority also describes how the structure of the ADEA requires the\n\ninterpretation of § 4(a)(2) as not providing coverage for disparate-impact hiring\n\nclaims. I concur in that discussion but wish to further elaborate.\n\n      In particular, the Majority compares § 4(a)(2) to § 4(c)(2), noting that the\n\nprovisions are “largely parallel” except that § 4(c)(2) includes the phrase “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” after its use of the term “employee.” To demonstrate\n\nwhy this point is so persuasive, it is helpful to look at both statutes together.\n\n      Section 4(a)(2) makes it unlawful for an employer\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any\n             way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n             individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n             adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n             such individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (emphasis added). Section 4(c)(2) makes it unlawful for a\n\nlabor organization\n\n             to limit, segregate, or classify its membership, or to\n             classify or fail or refuse to refer for employment any\n             individual, in any way which would deprive or tend to\n             deprive any individual of employment opportunities,\n             or would limit such employment opportunities or\n             otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee or\n\n                                           41\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 42 of 76\n\n\n             as an applicant for employment, because of such\n             individual’s age.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2) (emphasis added). The bolded portions of each statute are\n\nexactly the same. As for the regular-style portions of the statutes, though they are\n\ndifferent, they do not differ in a manner that affects the analysis of whether each\n\nstatute contemplates coverage of applicants for employment.\n\n      True, as Judge Martin points out, § 4(c)(2) deals with labor organizations\n\nand, in part, their role in employment opportunities, but that fact does not explain\n\nwhy the phrase “or as an applicant for employment” needed to be added in §\n\n4(c)(2) to cover applicants for employment if it did not need to be included in §\n\n4(a)(2) to cover applicants for employment. Nor have I been able to figure out\n\nwhy the fact that § 4(c)(2) deals with labor organizations while § 4(a)(2) deals with\n\nemployers matters to the analysis of why the phrase “or as an applicant for\n\nemployment” appears in § 4(c)(2) but not § 4(a)(2).\n\n      It seems to me that if the language in § 4(a)(2) covered applicants for\n\nemployment, the exact same language in § 4(c)(2) would suffice to do the same\n\nthing—regardless of the fact that one statute addresses employers and the other,\n\nlabor organizations. Yet Congress felt the need to add the phrase “or as an\n\napplicant for employment” after “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an\n\nemployee” in § 4(c)(2) to cover applicants. Why would Congress do that if\n\n“applicant[s] for employment” were already covered by the language in § 4(a)(2)?\n                                         42\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 43 of 76\n\n\n       The phrase “applicant [or applicants] for employment” also appears in other\n\nplaces in the ADEA. See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 623(d); 29 U.S.C. § 631(b); 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 633a(a), (b).       Clearly, Congress knew how to and did expressly include\n\n“applicants for employment” when it wished to do so. But conspicuously absent\n\nfrom § 4(a)(2) is any reference to “applicants for employment.” We must account\n\nfor this fact in a meaningful way. The only way that makes sense to me is that\n\nCongress provided coverage for disparate-impact hiring-related claims under\n\n§4(c)(2) but not under § 4(a)(2).\n\n                                                C.\n\n       The historical chronology of events relating to the enactment and\n\namendments of the ADEA and Title VII further demonstrates that § 4(a)(2) does\n\nnot cover disparate-impact hiring claims. 1\n\n\n       1\n          Judge Martin suggests that we should not consider the legislative sequence of events.\nSee Martin Dissent at n.5. In support of this position, she relies on Crosby v. National Foreign\nTrade Council, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118379\"><a href=\"/opinion/118379/crosby-v-national-foreign-trade-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), as an example of a case where the Supreme Court “refused\nto conclude that Congress ‘repeatedly declin[ing] to enact express preemption provisions’\nimplied anything ‘simply because the silence of Congress is ambiguous.’” Id. at 386–88, 120 S.\nCt. at 2301–02. The circumstances at issue in Crosby, however, are readily distinguishable from\nthose in this case, and I respectfully disagree that Crosby provides any support for the notion that\nthe legislative sequence of amendments in this case is irrelevant. In Crosby, Massachusetts\nenacted a statute barring state entities from buying goods or services from companies doing\nbusiness with Burma. Three months later, Congress passed a law imposing mandatory and\nconditional sanctions on Burma. The Supreme Court found Massachusetts’s law to be\npreempted by federal law because it stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of\nthe purposes and objectives of Congress. Id. at 372-73. In doing so, the Court rejected\nMassachusetts’s argument that Congress’s failure to preempt the state act demonstrated “implicit\npermission.” Id. at 387-88. In reaching this conclusion, the Court explained the unique nature of\npreemption:\n\n                                                43\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 44 of 76\n\n\n       In 1964, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADEA, which\n\nCongress enacted on December 15, 1967, was modeled after the Civil Rights Act\n\nof 1964. So § 703(a)(2) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and § 4(a)(2) of the\n\nADEA, at the time it was enacted, were exactly the same, except for the groups\n\nthat each provision protected. Section 703(a)(2) stated,\n\n               It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an\n               employer—(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his\n               employees in any way which would deprive or tend to\n               deprive an individual of employment opportunities or\n               otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n               because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or\n               national origin.\n\n\n               A failure to provide for preemption expressly may reflect nothing\n               more than the settled character of implied preemption doctrine that\n               courts will dependably apply, and in any event, the existence of\n               conflict cognizable under the Supremacy Clause does not depend\n               on express congressional recognition that federal and state law\n               may conflict. . . . The State’s inference of congressional intent is\n               unwarranted here, therefore, simply because the silence of\n               Congress is ambiguous.\n\nId. (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In other words, the mere fact that Congress did not\nexpressly preempt state action in the original statute or amend the statute later to preempt state\naction did not mean that Congress intended to authorize state action because Congress can\nimpliedly preempt state action. Of course, Villarreal’s case does not involve preemption, so for\nthat reason alone, Crosby is not instructive. But, in any case, I do not suggest considering\nCongress’s failure to amend § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA by adding the words “applicants for\nemployment,” in a vacuum, like the state did in Crosby. Instead, my point is that a comparison\nof the amendment made to § 703(a)(2) of Title VII—the statute on which the ADEA was\nbased—to the failure to make the same or similar amendment to the exact same language in §\n4(a)(2) of the ADEA, all within the same general time frame as Congress otherwise amended the\nADEA to add the same phrase that it added to § 703(a)(2) of Title VII—“applicants for\nemployment”—is meaningful. This sequence of events indicates that Congress understood a\ndifference between including the language “applicants for employment” and not doing so, and it\nacted deliberately in choosing to add that language to Title VII’s counterpart to the ADEA’s §\n4(a)(2) and to other sections of the ADEA but not to § 4(a)(2).\n\n                                               44\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 45 of 76\n\n\n\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88-352, 78 Stat. 241, 255.\n\n       But significantly, in February 1967—ten months before Congress enacted\n\nthe ADEA—it considered Senate Bill 1026, which sought to amend § 703(a)(2) of\n\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 to “[a]dd the phrase ‘or applicants for employment’\n\nafter the phrase ‘his employees in section 703(a)(2).” 113 CONG. REC. 3951\n\n(1967). While the amendment did not pass in 1967, Congress considered similar\n\nbills proposing the same amendment until it ultimately enacted the Equal\n\nEmployment Act of 1972 on March 24, 1972. That Act amended § 703(a)(2) of\n\nTitle VII to add the phrase “or applicants for employment” after the phrase “his\n\nemployees.” See Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972, Pub. L. 92-261, 86\n\nStat. 103, 109.\n\n      In stark contrast, Congress has never similarly amended the ADEA’s parallel\n\n§ 4(a)(2). Instead, to this day, unlike § 703(a)(2), § 4(a)(2) continues to lack the\n\nphrase “or applicants for employment.” That Congress had considered amending\n\nthe very same language in Title VII that appears in § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA, to add\n\nthe phrase “or applicants for employment”—even before Congress enacted the\n\nADEA—and that it ultimately did amend that same language in Title VII but did\n\nnot so amend § 4(a)(2), again strongly suggests that Congress did not intend to\n\ncover disparate-impact hiring claims in § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA.\n\n\n\n                                        45\n\f                 Case: 15-10602   Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 46 of 76\n\n\n      This historical fact takes on even more significance, in light of amendments\n\nto the ADEA that Congress enacted two years after it amended Title VII to include\n\n“applicants for employment.” In 1974, Congress amended the ADEA to make it\n\napplicable to federal-government employment.               See Fair Labor Standards\n\nAmendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93-259, 88 Stat. 55, 74.                Notably, Congress\n\nexpressly made the new provisions (codified at 29 U.S.C. § 633a) applicable to\n\nboth employees and “applicants for employment.” See, e.g., 29 U.S.C. § 633a(a).\n\nYet while Congress amended the ADEA, in part to add coverage for “applicants\n\nfor employment” in federal-government employment, it made no amendment to §\n\n4(a)(2) to add “applicants for employment,” despite having amended the parallel\n\nlanguage of § 703(a)(2) of Title VII to add “applicants for employment” just two\n\nyears earlier.\n\n      So to recap, the “applicants for employment” issue was on Congress’s radar\n\nscreen at the time that it enacted the ADEA without that language in § 4(a)(2); at\n\nthe time that it amended the parallel provision of Title VII, after the ADEA had\n\nalready been enacted; and at the time that Congress amended the ADEA itself, in\n\npart to provide coverage to “applicants for employment” in federal-government\n\nemployment. At any one of these times, Congress easily could have chosen to add\n\nthe “applicants for employment” language to § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA. It did not.\n\nWe can’t ignore that fact.\n\n                                           46\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 47 of 76\n\n\n       Nor does Smith v.

The\n\nplurality then cautioned that differences between the texts of Title VII and the\n\nADEA are important, noting that differences between age and the classes protected\n\nin Title VII, “coupled with a difference in the text of the statute . . . , may warrant\n\naddressing disparate-impact claims in the two statutes differently.” 2 Id. (emphasis\n\nin original). That is precisely what we have when we compare the texts of §\n\n4(a)(2) of the ADEA and § 703(a)(2) of Title VII. Indeed, though the plurality did\n\nnot consider whether § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA covers disparate-impact hiring claims,\n\nthe plurality nonetheless recognized that “the scope of disparate-impact liability\n\nunder ADEA is narrower than under Title VII.” Id. at 240 (plurality opinion).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          While, as Judge Martin points out in footnote 8 of her dissent, §4(f)(1) of the ADEA\nwas the provision under consideration in Smith, the Supreme Court did not limit its\npronouncement that differences between age and the classes protected in Title VII, “coupled with\na difference in the text of the statute . . . , may warrant addressing disparate-impact claims in the\ntwo statutes differently,” as pertaining solely to differences between Title VII and § 4(f)(1) of the\nADEA. Smith, 544 U.S. at 236 n.7 (plurality opinion). Instead, the Supreme Court broadly\nphrased its statement as a rule to be followed in the analysis of all disparate-impact claims under\nthe ADEA and Title VII. It just so happened in Smith, though, that the Supreme Court was\nconsidering only whether § 4(a)(2) of the ADEA provides for a disparate-impact claim of any\ntype to anyone. It was not looking at the issue of whether § 4(a)(2) provides for a disparate-\nimpact claim in the context of hiring decisions.\n\n                                                 47\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 48 of 76\n\n\n      For these reasons, I cannot find the ambiguity in § 4(a)(2) that my dissenting\n\ncolleagues describe, so I concur in the Majority’s decision holding that § 4(a)(2)\n\ndoes not provide coverage for disparate-impact hiring claims.\n\n      Nevertheless, as the Majority notes, see Maj. Op. at 24, that fact does not\n\nrender disparate-impact evidence irrelevant or inadmissible in disparate-treatment\n\ncases under the ADEA. To the contrary, disparate-impact evidence can play an\n\nimportant role in proving a disparate-treatment claim, and nothing we have said\n\nhere today suggests otherwise.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Because the language of § 4(a)(2), the statutory structure of the ADEA, and\n\nthe history of amendments to the ADEA and Title VII all lead to only one viable\n\ninterpretation of the meaning of § 4(a)(2), I concur in the Majority’s decision to the\n\nextent that it holds that no cause of action for disparate impact hiring exists under\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n      But I dissent from the Majority’s decision on the equitable-tolling issue and\n\njoin the dissents of my colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n                                          48\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 49 of 76\n\n\nMARTIN, Circuit Judge, dissenting, in which WILSON and JILL PRYOR, Circuit\nJudges, join, and JORDAN and ROSENBAUM, Circuit Judges, join as to Part II:\n\n      The Supreme Court told us in Smith v.

Mr. Villarreal\n\nsays he couldn’t know that RJ Reynolds broke the law because the company did so\n\nin secret.

This plainly describes what RJ Reynolds did to Mr.\n\nVillarreal. Specifically, Mr. Villarreal is an “individual” who was “deprive[d]” “of\n\nemployment opportunities” and denied any “status as an employee” because of\n\nsomething an employer did to “limit . . . his employees.” To use a simple example,\n\nsuppose a restaurant owner says he will pay college students more than he pays\n\nother employees. Smith said this kind of wage differentiation could violate the\n\nADEA. Now suppose the same employer says he won’t even hire someone who is\n\nnot a college student. This is plainly a decision to “limit . . . his employees” to\n\ncollege students. And college students tend to be young, so this limit may “tend to\n\ndeprive an[] individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n\nhis status as an employee, because of such individual’s age.” More to the point, an\n\nolder “individual” could find himself “deprive[d] . . . of employment\n\nopportunities” or denied any “status as an employee, because of such individual’s\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 52 of 76\n\n\nage.” The plain text of the statute covers a claim like this. And this perfectly\n\nnatural reading is the one the EEOC has always used.\n\n      The majority says: no, when Congress wrote “to limit, segregate, or classify\n\nhis employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual\n\nof employment opportunities” what it really meant (and said without ambiguity)\n\nwas “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive\n\nor tend to deprive [those] individual[s] of employment opportunities.” The\n\nmajority says the only reasonable reading of § 4(a)(2) is that the earlier reference\n\nto “his employees” (which describes who an employer can’t “limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify”) must be assumed to impliedly narrow the plainly broader reference to\n\n“any individual” (which describes who can’t be deprived of employment\n\nopportunities based on the employer’s actions).\n\n      That’s not what the statute says. Congress said age discrimination must not\n\n“deprive any individual of employment opportunities.” If Congress intended to\n\nprotect a narrower group, it would have said so. For example, the same sentence\n\nof § 4(a)(2) later uses the term “such individuals” to refer back to a set of people\n\nwho were introduced earlier. And a different part of the sentence uses the word\n\n“employees,” when referring to the people an employer can’t “limit, segregate, or\n\nclassify.” But when the statute described the group who would be protected by this\n\nprohibition imposed on employers, Congress chose the term “any individual.”\n\n                                          52\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 53 of 76\n\n\n“This deliberate variation in terminology within the same sentence of a statute\n\nsuggests that Congress did not interpret the two terms as being equivalent.” United\n\nStates v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76299\"><a href=\"/opinion/76299/united-states-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1236 (11th Cir. 2003). The rest of § 4(a)(2)\n\nshows that Congress knew how to use narrower terms, but it chose to say “any\n\nindividual” when referring to who can be injured by an employer’s discrimination.\n\nWe can’t ignore that choice. To the contrary, “[t]he interpretive canon that\n\nCongress acts intentionally when it omits language included elsewhere applies\n\nwith particular force” here, because Congress used the same language “in close\n\nproximity—indeed, in the same sentence.” Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v.

The majority also says the phrase\n\n“deprive any individual of employment opportunities” can’t mean refusing to hire\n\nsomeone. The majority’s position here is that these clear words (again, “deprive\n\nany individual of employment opportunities”) are impliedly limited by the later\n\nphrase “or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee” in such a way that\n\na person can never be “deprived of an employment opportunity” unless he also\n\nloses a current “status as an employee.” Maj. Op. at 10. There are at least two\n\nproblems with this. First, the majority reads “deprive any individual of\n\nemployment opportunities” out of the statute. This violates the principle that\n\n                                         53\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016      Page: 54 of 76\n\n\n“every word [in a statute] is to be given effect.” Antonin Scalia & Bryan A.\n\nGarner, Reading Law 174 (2012).\n\n       Second, even if we do take those words out of the statute, § 4(a)(2) still\n\napplies to Mr. Villarreal’s case through the statute’s “adversely affect his status as\n\nan employee” language. Certainly it is true that Mr. Villarreal was denied any\n\n“status as an employee.” Yet the majority says “affect his status as an employee”\n\ncan’t refer to a job that someone wanted but didn’t get because, according to the\n\nmajority, “[d]ictionaries confirm that the phrase ‘status as an employee’ connotes a\n\npresent fact.” Maj. Op. at 10. This resort to abstract definitions is puzzling.\n\nDictionaries say what a word means. They are far less useful for figuring out what\n\ntense a word “connotes,” since the same word can connote different tenses in\n\ndifferent contexts. And before using dictionaries to “confirm” the tense of a word\n\nin a statute, I would go to the Dictionary Act, which says that “unless the context\n\nindicates otherwise . . . words used in the present tense include the future as well as\n\nthe present.” 1 U.S.C. § 1. 1\n\n       Also, the majority’s statement that the phrase “status as an employee”\n\nalways “connotes a present fact” is just plain wrong. Title VII also uses the words\n\n“deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n\n       1\n          The Dictionary Act was enacted in 1871 and must “be treated as if incorporated in and\nas a part of subsequent enactments.” Great N.

Cases like Santos show\nhow the word “status” was used when Congress wrote the ADEA in 1967.\n                                                55\n\f                Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 56 of 76\n\n\n‘employees’ to mean something other than current employees,” including at least\n\none place where the term “most naturally is read to mean ‘prospective\n\nemployees.’” 519 U.S. at 343 n.3, 117 S. Ct. at 847 n.3. Robinson underscores\n\nhow radical the majority’s reading of § 4(a)(2) is. If “employees” can mean\n\nprospective employees, surely “any individual” can too. But the majority says\n\n“any individual” unambiguously means “current employees” only. That can’t be\n\nright.\n\n         The text of the ADEA makes plain that “any individual” who is “deprive[d]\n\n. . . of employment opportunities” because of his age can a file a disparate impact\n\nclaim. The majority never explains why Congress chose the term “any individual”\n\nin § 4(a)(2) if it really meant “employee.” I say “any individual” means “any\n\nindividual.” The plain text of § 4(a)(2) resolves this case in Mr. Villarreal’s favor.\n\nAnd this reading is only further confirmed by: (1) other parts of the ADEA; (2) the\n\nGriggs case; (3) the Smith case; and (4) deference to the EEOC. I will discuss\n\neach in turn.\n\n                                           A.\n\n         The phrasing of the rest of § 4(a) confirms that “any individual” in § 4(a)(2)\n\nmeans “any individual.” For example, no one disputes that “any individual” in\n\n§ 4(a)(1) refers to job applicants. And “a word or phrase is presumed to bear the\n\nsame meaning throughout a text.” Scalia & Garner, supra at 170. In fact,\n\n                                            56\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 57 of 76\n\n\nwhenever Congress meant anything other than “any individual” in § 4(a), it said so.\n\nSection 4(a) has three subsections, and only one does not use the term “any\n\nindividual.” That is § 4(a)(3), which prohibits “reduc[ing] the wage rate of any\n\nemployee.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(3) (emphasis added). Since employees earn wages\n\nand non-employees do not, no one disputes that § 4(a)(3) applies solely to\n\nemployees. Thus, Congress’s choice of “any employee” rather than “any\n\nindividual” in § 4(a)(3) makes sense.\n\n      In fact, § 4(a)(3) is a great tool for showing why the majority’s imposition of\n\nextra-textual meaning onto § 4(a)(2) is so wrong. The majority says Congress\n\nexpected courts to divine from other parts of the statute that “any individual” in\n\n§ 4(a)(2) actually means “any employee.” If that’s true, Congress should have said\n\n“any individual” in § 4(a)(3) too. That is because everyone could divine from\n\n“wage rate” that “any individual” implicitly meant “any employee.” Indeed, for\n\n§ 4(a)(3) that assumption would be safer than for § 4(a)(2), since by definition,\n\nnobody other than employees can have their wage rates reduced. Yet Congress\n\nstill said “any employee” rather than leaving this meaning to inference. Every time\n\nCongress meant “any employee” it said “any employee.” And every time it meant\n\n“any individual” it said “any individual.” In § 4(a)(2) it said “any individual.”\n\n      The majority compares § 4(a)(2) to other parts of the ADEA too, but both\n\nthose arguments end up confirming why “any individual” in § 4(a)(2) really means\n\n                                         57\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 58 of 76\n\n\n“any individual.” First, the majority asserts that “[u]nlike section 4(a)(1), section\n\n4(a)(2) does not mention an employer refusing to hire someone.” Maj. Op. at 15.\n\nAccording to the majority, this means § 4(a)(2) can’t possibly apply to hiring\n\nclaims. The majority accurately reports that § 4(a)(1) includes the phrase “refuse\n\nto hire” and § 4(a)(2) does not. But § 4(a)(1) also says “to discharge” and then\n\n§ 4(a)(2) does not. Applying the majority’s same logic therefore, we would have\n\nto say that § 4(a)(2) doesn’t protect an employee from getting fired because of his\n\nage. When asked about this at oral argument, RJ Reynolds responded that\n\n§ 4(a)(2) does impose liability on an employer who fires someone for being old,\n\nbut that liability comes from the later “adversely affect his status as an employee”\n\nlanguage in § 4(a)(2). But if firing claims come from that later language despite\n\nthe earlier “to limit, segregate, or classify” language (which says nothing about\n\nfiring), then surely failure-to-hire claims can come from the later “deprive any\n\nindividual of employment opportunities” language. As we know, that same\n\nlanguage in Title VII allows failure-to-hire claims. It must certainly do the same in\n\nthe ADEA.\n\n      Second, the majority points to § 4(c)(2), which uses the words “status as an\n\nemployee or as an applicant for employment” rather than “status as an employee”\n\nlike § 4(a)(2). Maj. Op. at 14–15. The majority says this means § 4(a)(2) can’t\n\nprotect people who weren’t hired for a job because of their age. The problem with\n\n                                          58\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 59 of 76\n\n\nthe majority’s reliance on § 4(c)(2) is that this subsection governs labor\n\norganizations, not employers. Specifically, it governs a labor organization’s ability\n\nto “refuse to refer for employment.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(c)(2) (emphasis added).\n\nThis part of the statute targets the unique way in which labor organizations can\n\ndiscriminate when they “refer” “applicants” to employers, such as through union\n\nhiring halls. 3 None of the other parts of the ADEA that govern employers say\n\nanything about “referring” anyone for employment. Employers, after all, don’t\n\n“refer applicants.” But labor organizations, by virtue of their unique referral role,\n\nare sometimes the sole conduit by which an employer can get potential job\n\napplicants.4 And § 4(c)(2) prohibits labor organizations from “refus[ing] to refer”\n\na person for employment at all because of her age and thereby denying her “status .\n\n. . as an applicant for employment.” In other words, the statute protects someone\n\nwho sought work but was denied status as an applicant—that is, being allowed to\n\n       3\n        For historical background on discriminatory union hiring halls, see Irving Kovarsky,\nCurrent Remedies for the Discriminatory Effects of Seniority Agreements, 24 Vand.

But the\n\n\n       5\n          Along these lines, it’s also dangerous to infer what Congress meant in a statute based on\nwhat it didn’t say at all. Judge Rosenbaum’s concurrence details the history of the ADEA, which\ntracks the language of Title VII. She focuses particularly on the fact that Congress never\namended the ADEA to add the phrase “or applicants for employment” to § 4(a)(2). But we\ncannot know what Congress meant by not amending the ADEA. Perhaps Judge Rosenbaum’s\ntheory on Congressional intent is correct, but it’s equally possible that Congress did not act\nbecause it thought the statute already encompassed job applicants. That is why the Supreme\nCourt has warned us as a general rule not to give weight to legislative inaction when interpreting\nstatutes. For example, in Crosby v.

Four Justices reached this result based on the plain text, though they also\n\ncited an EEOC regulation as evidence that “the agency charged by Congress with\n\n                                           63\n\f               Case: 15-10602        Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 64 of 76\n\n\nresponsibility for implementing the statute, 29 U.S.C. § 628, ha[s] consistently\n\ninterpreted” § 4(a)(2) in the same way. Smith, 544 U.S. at 239, 125 S. Ct. at 1544\n\n(plurality opinion). The plurality recognized that the regulation it was citing never\n\n“mention[ed] disparate impact by name” and never purported to interpret § 4(a)(2).\n\nId. 7 But the plurality nonetheless said this regulation “set[] forth the standards for\n\na disparate-impact claim.” Id. at 240, 125 S. Ct. at 1544. Justice Scalia (who\n\nadded the fifth vote) went further, declaring that the EEOC’s regulation made\n\nSmith “an absolutely classic case for deference to agency interpretation.” Id. at\n\n243, 125 S. Ct. at 1546 (Scalia, J., concurring in part).\n\n       When comparing § 4(a)(1) and § 4(a)(2), the Smith plurality pointed to\n\ndistinctions between employer motives and discriminatory effects as the “key\n\ntextual differences” between those subsections. Id. at 236 n.6, 125 S. Ct. at 1542\n\nn.6. In doing so, the plurality said nothing about the distinction between hiring\n\nversus other claims that the majority’s entire effort to distinguish Smith is staked\n\non.8 The plurality even cited two ADEA cases brought by job applicants in\n\n\n       7\n         Indeed that regulation simply said: “When an employment practice, including a test, is\nclaimed as a basis for different treatment of employees or applicants for employment on the\ngrounds that it is a ‘factor other than’ age, and such a practice has an adverse impact on\nindividuals within the protected age group, it can only be justified as a business necessity.” 29\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(d) (2004).\n       8\n          Judge Rosenbaum’s concurrence points out that the Smith plurality recognized that the\ndifference in the text of the ADEA and Title VII could warrant treating disparate impact claims\nunder the two statutes differently. This is true. But the plurality was specifically talking about\n§ 4(f)(1) of the ADEA, which contains language that significantly narrows its coverage by\n                                                64\n\f               Case: 15-10602       Date Filed: 10/05/2016        Page: 65 of 76\n\n\nsupport of its statement that “for over two decades after our decision in Griggs, the\n\nCourts of Appeals uniformly interpreted the ADEA as authorizing recovery on a\n\n‘disparate-impact’ theory in appropriate cases.” Id. at 236–37 & n.8, 125 S.

Among the eleven of us,\n\nwe read the statute to mean at least three different things. While each of us feels\n\ncertain about the correctness of our own reading, we can’t all be absolutely right.\n\nAnd where a statute can be variously interpreted (or in the vernacular, is\n\n“ambiguous”), courts must defer to the interpretation given by the agency charged\n\nwith enforcing the statute. This is one more reason § 4(a)(2) must be read to\n\nprotect job applicants. It is because the EEOC has always read the ADEA to\n\nprotect them. And “it is axiomatic that the EEOC’s interpretation of [the ADEA],\n\nfor which it has primary enforcement responsibility, need . . . only be reasonable to\n\n\npermitting “otherwise prohibited” action “where the differentiation is based on reasonable\nfactors other than age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(f)(1).

See 29\n\nC.F.R. § 1625.7(c). And a preamble section titled “Benefits of the Rule” uses the\n\nEEOC’s data on hiring discrimination to explain how the rule addresses “neutral\n\npractices that act as barriers to the employment of older workers”:\n\n       Data show that older individuals who become unemployed have more\n       difficulty finding a new position and tend to stay unemployed longer\n       than younger individuals. To the extent that the difficulty in finding\n       new work is attributable to neutral practices that act as barriers to the\n       employment of older workers, the regulation should help to reduce the\n       rate of their unemployment.\n\n       9\n          Related to this point, RJ Reynolds and its amici list various policy arguments in support\nof their view. The majority did right by choosing not to indulge these arguments. Policy choices\nbelong to Congress and to agencies, not courts. See Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v.

Still, because some of these\narguments might reappear in later litigation, I point out that they seem quite specious. RJ\nReynolds and its amici first warn that disparate impact liability for hiring criteria will end efforts\nto recruit recent graduates. But the statute prohibits “limit[ing]” employees, and recruitment\ndoes nothing to “limit” anyone. Instead it expands who will apply for a job. Also, among the\nrecruitment programs that RJ Reynolds’s amici claims are under threat are initiatives to target\nminority graduates. If those programs violate the ADEA, then they would have had to violate\nTitle VII too. But they don’t.\n        RJ Reynolds’s amici next argue that age discrimination doesn’t require disparate impact,\nsince all older workers were once young, so they didn’t face a lifetime (let alone generations) of\nprejudice as with race discrimination. The underlying point about race discrimination is a good\none. “[T]he persistence of racial inequality” requires effort “to counteract discrimination’s\nlingering effects. Those effects, reflective of a system of racial caste only recently ended, are\nevident in our workplaces.” Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

But this argument should be\nrecognized for what it is: an attempt to re-litigate Smith. Smith says the ADEA imposes\ndisparate impact liability for age discrimination. The question in Mr. Villarreal’s case is whether\nprotection from the disparate impact of age discrimination extends to job applicants.\n                                                 66\n\f             Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 67 of 76\n\n\n\n\n77 Fed.

The EEOC first said so through\n\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking in 1981. See 29 C.F.R. § 1625.7(d) (1981).

For example, Justice Thomas wrote, “[o]ne\n\nissue that may arise in such circumstances is whether the time begins to run when\n\nthe injury occurs as opposed to when the injury reasonably should have been\n\ndiscovered.” Id. But the Court concluded that the victim in that case “believed\n\nthat he was being discriminated against at the time that all [the discriminatory] acts\n\noccurred.” Id. (quotation omitted). For that reason, the Court ruled that the\n\nlimitations period was not tolled.\n\n\n\n\n                                          70\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 71 of 76\n\n\n      The equitable tolling cases the Supreme Court decided before Morgan also\n\ntouched on this idea of notice.

It\n\nis true that some equitable tolling cases don’t analyze notice in the same way, at\n\nleast not expressly. But those cases all address overt government deprivations,\n\nsuch as a denied social security claim, a breach of contract by the government, or a\n\nruling on a criminal conviction. In this type of case, notice can be assumed. For\n\nexample, a habeas petitioner can be assumed to have known about the ruling she is\n\nchallenging from the moment the ruling issued. Indeed the only way she wouldn’t\n\nknow is through something extraordinary, like deception or lawyer misconduct or\n\nabandonment. The same isn’t true for “[s]ecret preferences in hiring.” Reeb, 516\n\nF.2d at 931. In these cases, “subtle means of illegal discrimination, because of\n\ntheir very nature, are unlikely to be readily apparent to the individual discriminated\n\nagainst.” Id. (emphasis added). That’s why our court has always equitably tolled\n\nthe limitations period for these claims “until the facts which would support a cause\n\nof action are apparent or should be apparent.” Id. at 930.\n\n\n\n\n                                          71\n\f             Case: 15-10602    Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 72 of 76\n\n\n      The majority says Reeb is not relevant here because “that decision involved\n\nactive deception by the employer.” Maj.

Also, Reeb did not turn on the\n\nemployer’s deception. To the contrary, Judge Wisdom wrote that discriminatory\n\nhiring preferences tend to stay hidden “because of their very nature.” 516 F.3d at\n\n931.

The Tucker\n\nplaintiffs filed an EEOC charge more than 180 days after they were fired but less\n\nthan 180 days after they learned that this firing might have been discriminatory.\n\nThe plaintiffs weren’t misled, but the court allowed equitable tolling based on\n\nReeb. Chief Judge Godbold made the same point I make today:\n\n      The ‘prudent person’ requirement of Reeb is not triggered by a\n      seasonal black employee’s being notified of an otherwise\n      unexceptional decision that he is not going to be recalled. It would be\n      anomalous indeed if persons protected by the statute from racial\n      discrimination are required to presume that they are being\n      discriminated against.\n\nId. at 726. The same is true for Mr. Villarreal. He was not “required to presume”\n\ndiscrimination from the “otherwise unexceptional” fact that he didn’t get a job\n\noffer. Id.\n\n      Other courts have come to adopt the Reeb test too. Indeed, this court once\n\ncalled Reeb’s notice requirement “a pronouncement that would be echoed by\n                                         72\n\f               Case: 15-10602      Date Filed: 10/05/2016       Page: 73 of 76\n\n\nvarious circuits across the country.” Jones v.

Now the majority characterizes that the Second, Seventh, and\n\nD.C. Circuits courts as using a “general test” and says Mr. Villarreal has asked for\n\na “special test.” Maj. Op. at 26. These vague labels do more to confuse than\n\nclarify. The fact is that all three of the courts the majority references cited Reeb to\n\nhold that a plaintiff’s lack of notice about employment discrimination is an\n\n“extraordinary circumstance” that warrants equitable tolling. 11 So have at least\n\nthree others. 12 No court has ever criticized the Reeb test.

When\n\nHolland overruled our court’s equitable tolling standard, the Supreme Court\n\ninstructed that\n\n      the “exercise of a court’s equity powers must be made on a case-by-\n      case basis.” . . . . The “flexibility” inherent in “equitable procedure”\n      enables courts “to meet new situations that demand equitable\n      intervention, and to accord all the relief necessary to correct particular\n      injustices.” . . . Such courts exercise judgment . . . with awareness\n      of the fact that specific circumstances, often hard to predict in\n      advance, could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.\n\nId. at 649–50, 130 S. Ct. at 2563 (citations omitted) (alterations adopted). After\n\nHolland, we finally recognized that “[e]quitable tolling is, well, equitable in nature,\n\nand decisions regarding it must be made ‘on a case-by-case basis’ in light of\n\n‘specific circumstances, often hard to predict in advance.’” Hutchinson v. Florida,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798383\"><a href=\"/opinion/798383/hutchinson-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Holland, 130 S. Ct. at 2563). The\n\nmajority ignores that lesson here.\n\n      Worse, the majority’s rigid test makes little sense. The majority says Mr.\n\nVillarreal’s case needed to be dismissed because he didn’t “investigate the status of\n\nhis application.” Maj. Op. at 29. The majority never explains why this distinction\n\nmatters. Even if Mr. Villarreal learned that his application had been rejected, that\n\nwould reveal nothing about whether the rejection was discriminatory. Neither\n\nwould an inquiry from Mr. Villarreal about the status of his application have made\n\n                                          74\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016    Page: 75 of 76\n\n\nany difference to RJ Reynolds. Job applicants follow up on their applications all\n\nthe time. That routine occurrence does not give notice to the employer that a\n\ndiscrimination charge is coming. Mr. Villarreal’s complaint said he filed an EEOC\n\ncharge as soon as he learned that RJ Reynolds used illegal hiring criteria to reject\n\nhis application. And he claims he could not have learned about that secret conduct\n\nearlier. This is enough, in my view, to survive a motion to dismiss his case on the\n\npleadings.\n\n      I don’t dispute that equitable tolling requires plaintiffs to act diligently. But\n\nthe requirement has always been reasonable diligence. I see no basis to conclude\n\nthat Mr. Villarreal acted unreasonably here. In fact, RJ Reynolds and its amici\n\nexpressly ask us to speculate about facts that are not in the record. RJ Reynolds\n\nsays Mr. Villarreal’s actions were unreasonable because he “did not even try to\n\ninquire about his application. If he had, RJ Reynolds would have told him that it\n\nwas seeking entry-level salesmen with less experience.” And the Chamber of\n\nCommerce adds that Mr. Villarreal could have looked up whether the people RJ\n\nReynolds hired created profiles on the social networking website LinkedIn and\n\nthen researched the ages of those people somewhere else. But this appeal comes to\n\nus on a motion to dismiss. That means we can’t assume anything about what RJ\n\nReynolds “would have” said. And we certainly can’t know if using LinkedIn to\n\nbuild a cause of action would have been either reasonably prudent or at all fruitful.\n\n                                          75\n\f             Case: 15-10602     Date Filed: 10/05/2016   Page: 76 of 76\n\n\nOne thing we can know however is that “subtle means of illegal discrimination,\n\nbecause of their very nature, are unlikely to be readily apparent.” Reeb, 516 F.3d\n\nat 931.\n\n      Employers who act illegally should not escape liability just because their\n\nconduct was hidden through the end of the limitations period. In cases where\n\nillegal conduct is exposed after the limitations period, I would allow discovery on\n\nthe question our court has always asked in these cases: when did the “facts which\n\nwould support a cause of action [become] apparent . . . to a person with a\n\nreasonably prudent regard for his rights”? Id. at 930. If discovery is limited to that\n\nquestion, the burden on defendants will be minimal. On that note, it’s worth\n\nremembering that equitable doctrines arise out of concern for the circumstances of\n\nboth sides of a case. If RJ Reynolds showed that Mr. Villarreal’s delay was\n\nprejudicial in some way (such as due to lost evidence), a court would have to take\n\nthat into account. But that never happened here. Instead, the majority says delay\n\nis always unacceptable, even if a victim had zero reason to act earlier. The\n\nSupreme Court held six years ago that this court’s equitable tolling “standard is too\n\nrigid.” Holland, 560 U.S. at 634, 130 S. Ct. at 2554. The majority’s new rule\n\nreturns us down that path.\n\n\n\n\n                                          76\n\f</pre>",
