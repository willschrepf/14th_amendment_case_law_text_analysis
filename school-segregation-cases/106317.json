For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                I.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Since 1977, Janice Gray, an African American female, has\n\nbeen employed at the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station in Port\n\nGibson, Mississippi (the “Grand Gulf facility”).    On March 12,\n\n1999, Gray filed suit against her employer Entergy Operations,\n\nInc. (EOI) and several management officials under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981, claiming discrimination on the basis of race.    Her suit\n\nincluded the following three causes of action: failure to\n\npromote, payment of disparate wages, and establishment of\n\ndiscriminatory working conditions.\n\n     On January 7, 2000, defendants filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment.    In response, Gray requested a voluntary dismissal of\n\nseveral claims, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    She also filed a Motion to Strike Affidavit of James\n\nM. Cooley, the Manager of Employee Relations at the Grand Gulf\n\nfacility.    The district court, on March 2, 2000, denied Gray’s\n\nmotion to strike, granted her Rule 41 motion, and awarded\n\ndefendants summary judgment on the remaining claims.     After the\n\ndistrict court granted Gray’s Rule 41 motion, four claims\n\nremained: discriminatory promotion claim for the 1996 Site\n\nAdministrative Programs Coordinator position; discriminatory\n\npromotion claim for the 1999 Procurement Specialist III position;\n\ndisparate wages claim; and discriminatory working conditions\n\nclaim.\n\n                                   2\n\f     On March 16, 2000, Gray filed a Motion to Amend and to Make\n\nAdditional Findings of Fact and Motion to Amend Opinion and\n\nJudgment (“Rule 52 and 59(e) Motion”).    The district court denied\n\nthis motion on April 16, 2000.    Gray then filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal from this decision.1\n\n\n\n                       II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district\n\ncourt.    See Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, 174 F.3d 615, 618 (5th\n\nCir. 1999).   Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”    FED. R. CIV. P.\n\n56(c); see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23\n\n(1986).    “If the moving party meets the initial burden of showing\n\nthere is no genuine issue of material fact, the burden shifts to\n\nthe nonmoving party to produce evidence or designate specific\n\nfacts showing the existence of a genuine issue for trial.”     Allen\n\n\n\n     1\n       Gray asserts in her brief on appeal that Cooley’s\naffidavit was inaccurate. She does not argue that the affidavit\nshould have been stricken on this basis; rather, it appears that\nshe is attempting to demonstrate the existence of genuine issues\nof material fact. Thus, we address her arguments regarding\nCooley’s affidavit in the context of her discrimination claims.\nSee infra Section III.\n\n                                   3\n\fv. Rapides Parish Sch. Bd., 204 F.3d 619, 621 (5th Cir. 2000)\n\n(internal quotations and citation omitted).     Doubts are to be\n\nresolved in favor of the nonmoving party, and any reasonable\n\ninferences are to be drawn in favor of that party.     See Burch,\n\n174 F.3d at 619.\n\n\n\n                   III.     DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n     A plaintiff can prove a claim of intentional discrimination\n\nby either direct or circumstantial evidence.    Absent direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent, as is typically the case,\n\nproof via circumstantial evidence is accomplished using the\n\nframework set forth in the seminal case of McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).2    First, the plaintiff must\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination.     See Reeves v.\n\nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2106 (2000).\n\nSecond, the employer must respond with a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its decision.     See McDonnell\n\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.    This is only a burden of production,\n\nnot persuasion, involving no credibility assessments.     See Texas\n\n\n     2\n       Gray is asserting causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\nBecause “[c]laims of intentional discrimination brought under\nTitle VII and Section 1981 require the same proof to establish\nliability,” we will examine Gray’s § 1981 claims under the well-\nestablished Title VII rubric of analysis. See Byers v. Dallas\nMorning News, Inc., 209 F.3d 419, 422 n.1 (5th Cir. 2000); see\nalso Lawrence v. University of Tex. Med. Branch at Galveston, 163\nF.3d 309, 311 (5th Cir. 1999) (“Employment discrimination claims\nbrought under [§ 1981] . . . are analyzed under the evidentiary\nframework . . . [of] Title VII.”).\n\n                                   4\n\fDep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255-56 (1981).\n\nThird, if the employer carries its burden, the inference of\n\ndiscrimination (created by the plaintiff’s prima facie case)\n\nevaporates, and the plaintiff must prove intentional\n\ndiscrimination.    See St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S.\n\n502, 511 (1993).\n\n     In making this showing, the plaintiff can rely on evidence\n\nthat the employer’s reasons were a pretext for unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.    See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.   “Thus,\n\na plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence\n\nto find that the employer’s asserted justification is false, may\n\npermit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated.”    Reeves, 120 S. Ct. at 2109.   With this framework\n\nin mind, we proceed to analyze Gray’s three discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                    A.   Failure-to-Promote Claim\n\n     The district court granted defendants summary judgment on\n\nthe claim regarding the Site Administrative Programs Coordinator\n\nposition.3   The court found that Gray established a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination and that defendants put forth\n\n\n\n     3\n       The district court also ruled that Gray’s remaining\nfailure-to-promote claim (for the Procurement Specialist III\nposition) violated Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nbecause it was not contained in her original complaint. Gray is\nnot contesting this issue on appeal.\n\n                                  5\n\fnondiscriminatory reasons for their decision.   The district court\n\nthen concluded that Gray did not survive summary judgment because\n\nshe failed to demonstrate that defendants’ proffered reasons were\n\npretextual.\n\n     To establish a prima facie case of discrimination for a\n\npromotion claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the\n\nplaintiff is a member of a protected group; (2) the plaintiff was\n\nqualified for the position; (3) the plaintiff was subjected to an\n\nadverse employment action; and (4) the plaintiff was replaced by\n\nsomeone outside the protected class.   See Shackelford v. Deloitte\n\n& Touche, LLP, 190 F.3d 398, 404 (5th Cir. 1999).     We agree with\n\nthe district court that Gray established a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination: she is African American, a member of a racial\n\nminority; she was qualified for the position of Site\n\nAdministrative Programs Coordinator (she had at least a high\n\nschool diploma and at least ten years of nuclear or\n\nadministrative experience); she was not hired for the position;\n\nand Karen Rucker, a Caucasian female, was subsequently hired for\n\nthe position.   Defendants, in turn, have satisfied their burden\n\nof production and put forth two nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\ntheir employment decision: (1) Rucker was more qualified4; and\n\n\n     4\n       Defendants point to Rucker’s fluency in several languages,\nas well as her oral and written presentations to high-level\nBritish government officials. As they were looking for an\napplicant with strong communication skills who could interact\nextensively with the public and who could influence management at\nall levels, defendants state that the three-person interview\n\n                                 6\n\f(2) Rucker would be more compatible with her supervisor in that\n\nposition, Site Vice-President Joseph Hagan.5\n\n     To demonstrate that defendants’ reasons are pretextual, Gray\n\nmakes several arguments.   She first asserts that Rucker did not\n\nmeet the minimum qualifications for the position because there\n\nwas no proof of her high school diploma, or equivalent, in the\n\npersonnel files.   This is clearly rebutted by evidence in the\n\nrecord that Rucker’s education certificates from England were in\n\nher personnel file, and a defense expert testified that her\n\nEnglish certifications were the equivalent of a U.S. high school\n\ndiploma.\n\n     Gray also points out that Rucker became eligible to apply\n\nonly when the qualifications for the position were weakened (from\n\nten years of nuclear experience to ten years of nuclear or\n\nadministrative experience).   The district court found that Gray\n\nadmitted the qualifications were changed to match Rucker’s\n\nqualifications in particular, not simply because Rucker was\n\nwhite.   Furthermore, defendants bypassed other qualified white\n\ncandidates who were eligible when the position was first posted.\n\nThus, the re-posting of the position does not “prove by a\n\n\n\npanel (which included the African-American human resources\nmanager, Cooley) unanimously decided Rucker was the most\nqualified.\n     5\n       Defendants state that Rucker had previously worked for\nHagan as his secretary, and thus, Hagan was familiar with her\nabilities.\n\n                                 7\n\fpreponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered\n\nby the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext\n\nfor discrimination.”     Reeves, 120 S. Ct. at 2106 (internal\n\nquotations and citation omitted) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at\n\n253).\n\n     In addition, Gray puts forth statements from the deposition\n\nof Jeff Braswell, an EOI retiree, that qualifications were\n\ntailored to conform to the wishes of Mike Bakarich, a former\n\nmanager at the Grand Gulf facility.     Although defendants imply\n\nthat statements not in connection with this promotion claim are\n\nirrelevant, the Supreme Court clearly stated in Reeves that\n\npretext evidence should not be circumscribed as such.      See id. at\n\n2111.    Thus, general remarks should not be discounted because\n\nthey were not made in direct reference to the employment\n\ndecision; any evidence that could shed light on an employer’s\n\ntrue motive must be taken into account.     See id.   However, in\n\nthis case, the link between Braswell’s statements and defendants’\n\nemployment decision regarding the promotion are far too tenuous\n\nto establish pretext.6\n\n\n\n     6\n       Braswell’s testimony was in reference to another position;\nboth Braswell and Bakarich were no longer employed at EOI during\nthe interview process for this position; this position was to be\nunder Hagan, not Bakarich; a three-person panel, which included\nan African-American manager, interviewed all candidates for this\nposition; and Gray cites to no evidence in the record supporting\nher implication that Bakarich’s preferences for his “proteges”\nwere based on race (in fact, Braswell admitted that one of\nBakarich’s proteges was a black woman).\n\n                                   8\n\f     Although Gray had more seniority with the company and\n\neducation beyond high school, Rucker met the minimum\n\nqualifications and had other qualities that defendants found\n\nappealing for the position.    Gray has failed to create a genuine\n\nissue that defendants’ proffered reasons are pretextual7 and thus\n\ndoes not survive summary judgment on this claim.\n\n\n\n                      B. Disparate Wages Claim\n\n     In this claim, Gray alleges that defendants paid her\n\ndisproportionately less wages than similarly situated white\n\nemployees.    “To establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nrespecting compensation a plaintiff must prove (1) that she is a\n\nmember of a protected class, and (2) that she is paid less than a\n\nnonmember for work requiring substantially the same\n\nresponsibility.”    Uviedo v. Steves Sash & Door Co., 738 F.2d\n\n1425, 1431 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1054 (1986).\n\n     While Gray satisfies the first prong because she is African\n\nAmerican, she fails to make a showing on the second prong of the\n\ntest.    She has not presented any evidence that she was paid less\n\nthan white co-workers with similar responsibilities.    Rather than\n\nproviding specific information, Gray attempts to make her prima\n\n\n     7\n       Gray also makes other conclusory allegations that\ndefendants failed to advertise positions and did not select the\nmost qualified employees for the positions (choosing instead\n“select” employees). As these arguments are inadequately\nbriefed, we do not consider them on appeal. See Trevino v.\nJohnson, 168 F.3d 173, 181 n.3 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  9\n\ffacie case via several general arguments.   She points again to\n\nJeff Braswell’s deposition in which Braswell stated that\n\nsecretaries are paid higher than clerks for performing the same\n\nduties.   Braswell’s statements are not sufficient to establish\n\nGray’s prima facie case because Braswell does not testify as to\n\nGray’s wages or the wages of employees with Gray’s\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n     Gray also asserts that Ron Husbands, manager at Entergy\n\nServices, Inc. (ESI), testified in his deposition that merit pay\n\nraises are arbitrarily and subjectively determined.    This does\n\nnot aid Gray in establishing her prima facie case either because\n\nHusbands was testifying in another case, Washington v. Entergy\n\nOperations, Inc.; he is a manager at ESI, not EOI; he was\n\ntestifying as to how raises were allocated to ESI employees; and\n\nhe did not provide any information as to Gray’s wages or the\n\nwages of employees similarly situated to Gray.8    As such, Gray\n\nhas not created a genuine issue by pitting Husbands’s affidavit\n\nagainst Cooley’s affidavit, in which Cooley stated that EOI\n\nperformance appraisals are primarily objective.9\n\n\n     8\n       We also note that Gray mischaracterizes Husbands’s\ntestimony as stating that wages at ESI were subjectively or\narbitrarily determined. Husbands actually stated that while\nspecific numerical percentages were not used, factors such as\nperformance and potential guided their personnel determinations.\n     9\n       Gray’s reliance on the deposition of John J. Farren, the\nGrand Gulf facility’s Human Resources Representative, is also of\nno avail. His testimony, examined in full context, does not\nsupport Gray’s contention that salary determinations are\n\n                                10\n\f     Because Gray has not demonstrated with particularity the\n\nidentity of the similarly situated non-minority employees who\n\nwere paid higher wages, we agree with the district court that\n\nGray failed to establish a prima facie case on her disparate\n\nwages claim.    Thus, summary judgment on this claim was\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n\n                     C. Working Conditions Claim\n\n     Gray asserts that she “experienced [a] discriminatory work\n\nenvironment.”    She puts forth statistics that African Americans\n\nare concentrated in the unskilled and minimally skilled jobs at\n\nEOI, whereas whites are in the professional jobs.    Gray’s\n\nspecific allegations regarding this claim are not entirely clear.\n\nIf Gray is attempting to demonstrate disparate impact with these\n\nstatistics, she does not state a claim cognizable under § 1981.\n\nWhile “[d]isparate impact claims . . . do not require proof of\n\nintent to discriminate,” Munoz v. Orr, 200 F.3d 291, 299 (5th\n\nCir. 2000), § 1981 claims necessarily entail proof of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.    See General Bldg. Contractors Ass’n v.\n\nPennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 391 (1982) (“[Section] 1981 . . . can\n\nbe violated only by purposeful discrimination.”).\n\n     Because Gray explicitly framed her claims under § 1981, her\n\nworking conditions claim can then be based only on disparate\n\n\n\narbitrary.\n\n                                 11\n\ftreatment, which “refers to deliberate discrimination in the\n\nterms or conditions of employment.”   Munoz, 200 F.3d at 299.    In\n\nsupport of this claim, Gray asserts that statistics show there\n\nare “black jobs” and “white jobs,” and she appears to argue that\n\nthese segregated job classifications are furthered by the use of\n\nsubjective and arbitrary criteria in employment decisions.10\n\nWhile statistical evidence is common in so-called “pattern or\n\npractice cases” (class actions alleging disparate treatment), an\n\nindividual plaintiff can also utilize such evidence to\n\ndemonstrate intentional discrimination.\n\n     The plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of\n     disparate treatment using statistics alone if the\n     statistics show a gross disparity in the treatment of\n     workers based on discriminatory factors. However, if\n     the plaintiffs’ [sic] statistical evidence is\n     insufficient alone to establish a prima facie case of\n     disparate treatment, the plaintiff may combine the\n     statistical evidence with historical, individual, or\n     circumstantial evidence.\n\nTrevino v. Holly Sugar Corp., 811 F.2d 896, 902 (5th Cir. 1987)\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted); see also Krodel v.\n\nYoung, 748 F.2d 701, 710 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (stating that, for\n\nindividual disparate treatment plaintiffs, the Supreme Court “has\n\npointed out that [statistical] evidence is admissible and may be\n\nhelpful, though ordinarily not dispositive”).\n\n\n     10\n       Gray does not expressly characterize her working\nconditions claim as such. However, this circuit has held\nconsistently that claims of pro se appellants are liberally\nconstrued. See, e.g., United States v. Glinsey, 209 F.3d 386,\n392 n.4 (5th Cir. 2000); Chriceol v. Phillips, 169 F.3d 313, 315\nn.2 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n                               12\n\f     In this case, Gray’s statistics that African Americans are\n\nconcentrated in the minimally skilled jobs are derived from the\n\ndeposition of William Boykin, a plaintiff pursuing his own action\n\nagainst EOI.   Defendants argue that these statistics are not\n\nadmissible in this case because Boykin is not qualified to give\n\nsuch testimony and because the numbers are unsubstantiated.       We\n\ndo not decide this issue because we agree with the district\n\ncourt’s assessment that the evidence “does not prove [Gray],\n\nindividually, has suffered discrimination.”     That the majority of\n\nemployees in the professional positions are white does not\n\nineluctably lead to an inference of intentional discrimination,\n\nestablishing a prima facie case.     Gray has not presented any\n\nevidence linking that disparity with racial animus (which\n\nadversely affected her employment) and thus fails to demonstrate\n\na prima facie case of disparate treatment.\n\n     Gray also asserts that the 1996 EEO-1 reports submitted by\n\nEOI to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demonstrate\n\ndiscriminatory intent.   We do not agree.    These reports\n\nillustrate the racial composition in the various positions at\n\nEOI, and again, Gray has not demonstrated that the numbers were\n\nthe result of invidious bias, as required by a disparate\n\ntreatment claim.\n\n     Thus, Gray has failed to create a genuine issue of\n\nintentional discrimination in her working conditions claim, and\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate in this regard.\n\n                                13\n\f                         IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the above stated reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                14\n\f",

For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                I.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n     Since 1977, Janice Gray, an African American female, has\n\nbeen employed at the Grand Gulf Nuclear Power Station in Port\n\nGibson, Mississippi (the “Grand Gulf facility”).    On March 12,\n\n1999, Gray filed suit against her employer Entergy Operations,\n\nInc. (EOI) and several management officials under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1981, claiming discrimination on the basis of race.    Her suit\n\nincluded the following three causes of action: failure to\n\npromote, payment of disparate wages, and establishment of\n\ndiscriminatory working conditions.\n\n     On January 7, 2000, defendants filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment.    In response, Gray requested a voluntary dismissal of\n\nseveral claims, pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure.    She also filed a Motion to Strike Affidavit of James\n\nM. Cooley, the Manager of Employee Relations at the Grand Gulf\n\nfacility.    The district court, on March 2, 2000, denied Gray’s\n\nmotion to strike, granted her Rule 41 motion, and awarded\n\ndefendants summary judgment on the remaining claims.     After the\n\ndistrict court granted Gray’s Rule 41 motion, four claims\n\nremained: discriminatory promotion claim for the 1996 Site\n\nAdministrative Programs Coordinator position; discriminatory\n\npromotion claim for the 1999 Procurement Specialist III position;\n\ndisparate wages claim; and discriminatory working conditions\n\nclaim.\n\n                                   2\n\f     On March 16, 2000, Gray filed a Motion to Amend and to Make\n\nAdditional Findings of Fact and Motion to Amend Opinion and\n\nJudgment (“Rule 52 and 59(e) Motion”).    The district court denied\n\nthis motion on April 16, 2000.    Gray then filed a timely notice\n\nof appeal from this decision.1\n\n\n\n                       II.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district\n\ncourt.    See Burch v. City of Nacogdoches, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763490\"><a href=\"/opinion/763490/gene-a-burch-v-city-of-nacogdoches/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618 (5th\n\nCir. 1999).   Summary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”    FED.

She does not argue that the affidavit\nshould have been stricken on this basis; rather, it appears that\nshe is attempting to demonstrate the existence of genuine issues\nof material fact. Thus, we address her arguments regarding\nCooley’s affidavit in the context of her discrimination claims.\nSee infra Section III.\n\n                                   3\n\fv. Rapides Parish Sch.

DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS\n\n     A plaintiff can prove a claim of intentional discrimination\n\nby either direct or circumstantial evidence.    Absent direct\n\nevidence of discriminatory intent, as is typically the case,\n\nproof via circumstantial evidence is accomplished using the\n\nframework set forth in the seminal case of McDonnell Douglas\n\nCorp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973).2    First, the plaintiff must\n\nestablish a prima facie case of discrimination.     See Reeves v.\n\nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2106 (2000).\n\nSecond, the employer must respond with a legitimate,\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for its decision.     See McDonnell\n\nDouglas, 411 U.S. at 802.    This is only a burden of production,\n\nnot persuasion, involving no credibility assessments.     See Texas\n\n\n     2\n       Gray is asserting causes of action under 42 U.S.C. § 1981.\nBecause “[c]laims of intentional discrimination brought under\nTitle VII and Section 1981 require the same proof to establish\nliability,” we will examine Gray’s § 1981 claims under the well-\nestablished Title VII rubric of analysis. See Byers v. Dallas\nMorning News, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"20728\"><a href=\"/opinion/20728/byers-v-dallas-morning-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 n.1 (5th Cir. 2000); see\nalso Lawrence v.

[of] Title VII.”).\n\n                                   4\n\fDep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255-56 (1981).\n\nThird, if the employer carries its burden, the inference of\n\ndiscrimination (created by the plaintiff’s prima facie case)\n\nevaporates, and the plaintiff must prove intentional\n\ndiscrimination.    See St. Mary’s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 511 (1993).\n\n     In making this showing, the plaintiff can rely on evidence\n\nthat the employer’s reasons were a pretext for unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.    See McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.   “Thus,\n\na plaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence\n\nto find that the employer’s asserted justification is false, may\n\npermit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated.”    Reeves, 120 S. Ct. at 2109.   With this framework\n\nin mind, we proceed to analyze Gray’s three discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\n\n\n                    A.   Failure-to-Promote Claim\n\n     The district court granted defendants summary judgment on\n\nthe claim regarding the Site Administrative Programs Coordinator\n\nposition.3   The court found that Gray established a prima facie\n\ncase of discrimination and that defendants put forth\n\n\n\n     3\n       The district court also ruled that Gray’s remaining\nfailure-to-promote claim (for the Procurement Specialist III\nposition) violated Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\nbecause it was not contained in her original complaint. Gray is\nnot contesting this issue on appeal.\n\n                                  5\n\fnondiscriminatory reasons for their decision.   The district court\n\nthen concluded that Gray did not survive summary judgment because\n\nshe failed to demonstrate that defendants’ proffered reasons were\n\npretextual.\n\n     To establish a prima facie case of discrimination for a\n\npromotion claim, the plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the\n\nplaintiff is a member of a protected group; (2) the plaintiff was\n\nqualified for the position; (3) the plaintiff was subjected to an\n\nadverse employment action; and (4) the plaintiff was replaced by\n\nsomeone outside the protected class.   See Shackelford v. Deloitte\n\n& Touche, LLP, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18788\"><a href=\"/opinion/18788/shackelford-v-deloitte-touche-ll/\"><span class=\"volume\">190</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 404 (5th Cir. 1999).     We agree with\n\nthe district court that Gray established a prima facie case of\n\ndiscrimination: she is African American, a member of a racial\n\nminority; she was qualified for the position of Site\n\nAdministrative Programs Coordinator (she had at least a high\n\nschool diploma and at least ten years of nuclear or\n\nadministrative experience); she was not hired for the position;\n\nand Karen Rucker, a Caucasian female, was subsequently hired for\n\nthe position.   Defendants, in turn, have satisfied their burden\n\nof production and put forth two nondiscriminatory reasons for\n\ntheir employment decision: (1) Rucker was more qualified4; and\n\n\n     4\n       Defendants point to Rucker’s fluency in several languages,\nas well as her oral and written presentations to high-level\nBritish government officials. As they were looking for an\napplicant with strong communication skills who could interact\nextensively with the public and who could influence management at\nall levels, defendants state that the three-person interview\n\n                                 6\n\f(2) Rucker would be more compatible with her supervisor in that\n\nposition, Site Vice-President Joseph Hagan.5\n\n     To demonstrate that defendants’ reasons are pretextual, Gray\n\nmakes several arguments.   She first asserts that Rucker did not\n\nmeet the minimum qualifications for the position because there\n\nwas no proof of her high school diploma, or equivalent, in the\n\npersonnel files.   This is clearly rebutted by evidence in the\n\nrecord that Rucker’s education certificates from England were in\n\nher personnel file, and a defense expert testified that her\n\nEnglish certifications were the equivalent of a U.S. high school\n\ndiploma.\n\n     Gray also points out that Rucker became eligible to apply\n\nonly when the qualifications for the position were weakened (from\n\nten years of nuclear experience to ten years of nuclear or\n\nadministrative experience).   The district court found that Gray\n\nadmitted the qualifications were changed to match Rucker’s\n\nqualifications in particular, not simply because Rucker was\n\nwhite.   Furthermore, defendants bypassed other qualified white\n\ncandidates who were eligible when the position was first posted.\n\nThus, the re-posting of the position does not “prove by a\n\n\n\npanel (which included the African-American human resources\nmanager, Cooley) unanimously decided Rucker was the most\nqualified.\n     5\n       Defendants state that Rucker had previously worked for\nHagan as his secretary, and thus, Hagan was familiar with her\nabilities.\n\n                                 7\n\fpreponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered\n\nby the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext\n\nfor discrimination.”     Reeves, 120 S. Ct. at 2106 (internal\n\nquotations and citation omitted) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at\n\n253).\n\n     In addition, Gray puts forth statements from the deposition\n\nof Jeff Braswell, an EOI retiree, that qualifications were\n\ntailored to conform to the wishes of Mike Bakarich, a former\n\nmanager at the Grand Gulf facility.     Although defendants imply\n\nthat statements not in connection with this promotion claim are\n\nirrelevant, the Supreme Court clearly stated in Reeves that\n\npretext evidence should not be circumscribed as such.      See id. at\n\n2111.    Thus, general remarks should not be discounted because\n\nthey were not made in direct reference to the employment\n\ndecision; any evidence that could shed light on an employer’s\n\ntrue motive must be taken into account.     See id.   However, in\n\nthis case, the link between Braswell’s statements and defendants’\n\nemployment decision regarding the promotion are far too tenuous\n\nto establish pretext.6\n\n\n\n     6\n       Braswell’s testimony was in reference to another position;\nboth Braswell and Bakarich were no longer employed at EOI during\nthe interview process for this position; this position was to be\nunder Hagan, not Bakarich; a three-person panel, which included\nan African-American manager, interviewed all candidates for this\nposition; and Gray cites to no evidence in the record supporting\nher implication that Bakarich’s preferences for his “proteges”\nwere based on race (in fact, Braswell admitted that one of\nBakarich’s proteges was a black woman).\n\n                                   8\n\f     Although Gray had more seniority with the company and\n\neducation beyond high school, Rucker met the minimum\n\nqualifications and had other qualities that defendants found\n\nappealing for the position.    Gray has failed to create a genuine\n\nissue that defendants’ proffered reasons are pretextual7 and thus\n\ndoes not survive summary judgment on this claim.\n\n\n\n                      B. Disparate Wages Claim\n\n     In this claim, Gray alleges that defendants paid her\n\ndisproportionately less wages than similarly situated white\n\nemployees.    “To establish a prima facie case of discrimination\n\nrespecting compensation a plaintiff must prove (1) that she is a\n\nmember of a protected class, and (2) that she is paid less than a\n\nnonmember for work requiring substantially the same\n\nresponsibility.”    Uviedo v. Steves Sash & Door Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438815\"><a href=\"/opinion/438815/35-fair-emplpraccas-906-35-empl-prac-dec-p-34586-ana-m-uviedo-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1431 (5th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1054</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).\n\n     While Gray satisfies the first prong because she is African\n\nAmerican, she fails to make a showing on the second prong of the\n\ntest.    She has not presented any evidence that she was paid less\n\nthan white co-workers with similar responsibilities.    Rather than\n\nproviding specific information, Gray attempts to make her prima\n\n\n     7\n       Gray also makes other conclusory allegations that\ndefendants failed to advertise positions and did not select the\nmost qualified employees for the positions (choosing instead\n“select” employees). As these arguments are inadequately\nbriefed, we do not consider them on appeal. See Trevino v.\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761794\"><a href=\"/opinion/761794/joe-mario-trevino-jr-v-gary-l-johnson-director-texas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181 n.3 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  9\n\ffacie case via several general arguments.   She points again to\n\nJeff Braswell’s deposition in which Braswell stated that\n\nsecretaries are paid higher than clerks for performing the same\n\nduties.   Braswell’s statements are not sufficient to establish\n\nGray’s prima facie case because Braswell does not testify as to\n\nGray’s wages or the wages of employees with Gray’s\n\nresponsibilities.\n\n     Gray also asserts that Ron Husbands, manager at Entergy\n\nServices, Inc. (ESI), testified in his deposition that merit pay\n\nraises are arbitrarily and subjectively determined.    This does\n\nnot aid Gray in establishing her prima facie case either because\n\nHusbands was testifying in another case, Washington v. Entergy\n\nOperations, Inc.; he is a manager at ESI, not EOI; he was\n\ntestifying as to how raises were allocated to ESI employees; and\n\nhe did not provide any information as to Gray’s wages or the\n\nwages of employees similarly situated to Gray.8    As such, Gray\n\nhas not created a genuine issue by pitting Husbands’s affidavit\n\nagainst Cooley’s affidavit, in which Cooley stated that EOI\n\nperformance appraisals are primarily objective.9\n\n\n     8\n       We also note that Gray mischaracterizes Husbands’s\ntestimony as stating that wages at ESI were subjectively or\narbitrarily determined. Husbands actually stated that while\nspecific numerical percentages were not used, factors such as\nperformance and potential guided their personnel determinations.\n     9\n       Gray’s reliance on the deposition of John J. Farren, the\nGrand Gulf facility’s Human Resources Representative, is also of\nno avail. His testimony, examined in full context, does not\nsupport Gray’s contention that salary determinations are\n\n                                10\n\f     Because Gray has not demonstrated with particularity the\n\nidentity of the similarly situated non-minority employees who\n\nwere paid higher wages, we agree with the district court that\n\nGray failed to establish a prima facie case on her disparate\n\nwages claim.    Thus, summary judgment on this claim was\n\nappropriate.\n\n\n\n                     C. Working Conditions Claim\n\n     Gray asserts that she “experienced [a] discriminatory work\n\nenvironment.”    She puts forth statistics that African Americans\n\nare concentrated in the unskilled and minimally skilled jobs at\n\nEOI, whereas whites are in the professional jobs.    Gray’s\n\nspecific allegations regarding this claim are not entirely clear.\n\nIf Gray is attempting to demonstrate disparate impact with these\n\nstatistics, she does not state a claim cognizable under § 1981.\n\nWhile “[d]isparate impact claims . . . do not require proof of\n\nintent to discriminate,” Munoz v. Orr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"19554\"><a href=\"/opinion/19554/munoz-v-orr/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (5th\n\nCir. 2000), § 1981 claims necessarily entail proof of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.

In\n\nsupport of this claim, Gray asserts that statistics show there\n\nare “black jobs” and “white jobs,” and she appears to argue that\n\nthese segregated job classifications are furthered by the use of\n\nsubjective and arbitrary criteria in employment decisions.10\n\nWhile statistical evidence is common in so-called “pattern or\n\npractice cases” (class actions alleging disparate treatment), an\n\nindividual plaintiff can also utilize such evidence to\n\ndemonstrate intentional discrimination.\n\n     The plaintiff may establish a prima facie case of\n     disparate treatment using statistics alone if the\n     statistics show a gross disparity in the treatment of\n     workers based on discriminatory factors. However, if\n     the plaintiffs’ [sic] statistical evidence is\n     insufficient alone to establish a prima facie case of\n     disparate treatment, the plaintiff may combine the\n     statistical evidence with historical, individual, or\n     circumstantial evidence.\n\nTrevino v.

Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"17015\"><a href=\"/opinion/17015/chriceol-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315\nn.2 (5th Cir. 1999).\n\n                               12\n\f     In this case, Gray’s statistics that African Americans are\n\nconcentrated in the minimally skilled jobs are derived from the\n\ndeposition of William Boykin, a plaintiff pursuing his own action\n\nagainst EOI.   Defendants argue that these statistics are not\n\nadmissible in this case because Boykin is not qualified to give\n\nsuch testimony and because the numbers are unsubstantiated.       We\n\ndo not decide this issue because we agree with the district\n\ncourt’s assessment that the evidence “does not prove [Gray],\n\nindividually, has suffered discrimination.”     That the majority of\n\nemployees in the professional positions are white does not\n\nineluctably lead to an inference of intentional discrimination,\n\nestablishing a prima facie case.     Gray has not presented any\n\nevidence linking that disparity with racial animus (which\n\nadversely affected her employment) and thus fails to demonstrate\n\na prima facie case of disparate treatment.\n\n     Gray also asserts that the 1996 EEO-1 reports submitted by\n\nEOI to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demonstrate\n\ndiscriminatory intent.   We do not agree.    These reports\n\nillustrate the racial composition in the various positions at\n\nEOI, and again, Gray has not demonstrated that the numbers were\n\nthe result of invidious bias, as required by a disparate\n\ntreatment claim.\n\n     Thus, Gray has failed to create a genuine issue of\n\nintentional discrimination in her working conditions claim, and\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate in this regard.\n\n                                13\n\f                         IV.   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the above stated reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n\n\n\n                                14\n\f</pre>",
