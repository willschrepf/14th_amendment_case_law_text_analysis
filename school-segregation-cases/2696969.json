Du Pont De Nemours and Company (“Du Pont”), challenges the\r\ntrial court’s </span><span>rendition of summary judgment</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> in favor of appellee, Shell Oil Company\r\n(“Shell”), in Du Pont’s suit against Shell for breach of an indemnification agreement. \r\nIn four issues, Du Pont contends that Shell owed Du Pont a duty to indemnify it for\r\n“defense costs that advanced both [] the defense of Shell related to Waste Materials\r\nand [] the defense of Du Pont (or another defendant) related to waste from another\r\nfacility”; Du Pont properly allocated a percentage of these “defense costs” to Shell;\r\nDu Pont properly segregated the defense costs “that did not relate to the defense of\r\nWaste Materials” from the remainder of the defense costs that did relate to Waste\r\nMaterials; Shell owed Du Pont a duty to indemnify it for “a share of the settlement\r\nfunds it paid to resolve ‘Claims related to Waste Materials’”; and the trial court\r\nshould have awarded it</span><span> “defense costs for its prosecution of its indemnity claim.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We reverse and render. <span>Factual and Procedural Background</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Pursuant to a Detergents Toll Conversion Agreement (“DTCA”), Du Pont\r\nmanufactured Shop Ligand, a chemical, at a facility in Mobile, Alabama, using\r\nShell’s raw materials and for Shell’s use.  Under the DTCA, Shell retained ownership\r\nof the wastes and waste by-products from the Shop Ligand production process,\r\nreferred to by the parties in the DTCA as the “Waste Materials.”  Moreover, Shell\r\ndesignated the transporter and the disposal site of the Waste Materials and reimbursed\r\nDu Pont for transportation and disposal costs. Finally, article 15 of the DTCA\r\ncontained two indemnity provisions, which generally provided that Shell would\r\n“defend and indemnify Du Pont . . . against all Claims related to Waste Materials</span></span><span>.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Du Pont shipped over 12 million pounds of Waste Materials to an injection\r\nwell in Bayou Sorrell, Louisiana.  The injection well subsequently became the subject\r\nof multiple lawsuits ultimately consolidated into a class action suit in federal district\r\ncourt.  Du Pont and Shell, as well as hundreds of other defendants, were sued in this\r\nunderlying litigation for their roles in generating and disposing of wastes at the\r\ninjection well.  The plaintiffs in the underlying litigation did not identify any\r\nparticular defendant as responsible for any specific waste.  Rather, the plaintiffs\r\nalleged that all of the defendants’ wastes commingled at the site and these\r\ncommingled wastes collectively harmed them. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>All parties agree that Shell and Du Pont were sued, in part, for their roles in\r\ngenerating and transporting Waste Materials to the injection well; both Shell and Du\r\nPont were also sued for claims unrelated to Waste Materials.  Du Pont was sued for\r\nshipping to the injection well (1) the Waste Materials and (2) 7.6 million pounds of\r\nwaste from its “Pontchartrain Facility” in La Place, Louisiana.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>After being sued, Du Pont requested that Shell, pursuant to the DTCA, </span><span> provide\r\nit a defense and indemnity in the underlying litigation.  Although Du Pont requested\r\na response within 30 days,  Shell responded to this demand over one year later.  Shell\r\nrecognized </span><span>its “responsibility” for the Waste Materials, but denied responsibility for\r\nwaste from other facilities.   Shell stated that it would not “defend or indemnify any\r\njudgment against Du Pont for other wastes” and offered Du Pont a limited indemnity,\r\nconditioned upon Du Pont’s waiving its right to recover settlement payments if the\r\nplaintiffs and defendants in the underlying litigation accomplished an “early\r\nsettlement.”  Shell also indicated that it was unwilling to reimburse Du Pont for any\r\ndefense costs expended prior to Shell’s offer.  Du Pont rejected Shell’s conditional\r\nindemnity and continued its defense.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The plaintiffs and defendants eventually settled the underlying litigation. \r\nThereafter, Shell sent Du Pont another letter stating that it intended to indemnify Du\r\nPont only for shipments of Waste Materials.  Shell asserted that the parties needed to\r\n“determine how to split out those costs <i>solely </i>related to the waste shipped from [the\r\nMobile Facility] on [Shell’s] behalf.” (Emphasis added.)  Shell requested that Du Pont\r\nsubmit its costs with supporting documentation, and, in December 2004, Du Pont sent\r\nShell a letter breaking down its annual defense costs.  Du Pont then requested that\r\nShell pay (1) a percentage of defense costs that related to both Waste Materials and\r\nnon-Waste Materials and (2) $31,000 in costs that solely related to Waste Materials\r\nfor which Shell was “solely responsible.”  Shell refused to pay any amounts other\r\nthan the $31,000 in defense costs solely related to Waste Materials. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Du Pont filed suit, asserting that Shell breached its duty to defend and\r\nindemnify it in the underlying litigation.  Shell answered, and filed a motion for\r\npartial summary judgment, seeking a declaration that it owed Du Pont indemnity\r\n“only for defense costs <i>directly </i>related”<i> </i>to Waste Materials, and not a percentage of\r\ncosts incurred by Du Pont “in its overall defense.” (Emphasis added.)  The trial court\r\ngranted Shell partial summary judgment, but in its order it simply tracked the\r\nlanguage of the DTCA, declaring that Shell was required to indemnify Du Pont for\r\n“defense costs and settlement funds per [s]ection 15 of the [DTCA] incurred by Du\r\nPont which are related to the Waste Materials.”  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment.  In its summary\r\njudgment motion, Du Pont argued that the DTCA was unambiguous and required\r\nShell to defend and indemnify Du Pont for the majority of defense costs expended in\r\nthe underlying litigation because the defense costs “related to” Waste Materials.  Du\r\nPont attached to its motion the affidavit of Bruce Evanick, Du Pont’s counsel, and Du\r\nPont later filed several supplemental affidavits from Evanick.  In these affidavits,\r\nEvanick explained that pursuant to the DTCA, Du Pont was seeking to recover from\r\nShell (1) $498,212.60 in “reasonable and necessary defense costs (including\r\nattorney’s fees and other defense costs)” and settlement costs, which represented only\r\n</span><span>“an allocated portion” of its total defense and settlement costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials and (2) $224,620.90 for “attorney’s fees and costs” incurred in prosecuting\r\nits indemnity claim against Shell.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In regard to Du Pont’s claim for defense and settlement costs of the underlying\r\nlitigation, </span><span>Evanick agreed </span><span>that, in addition to representing Du Pont for disposing 12\r\nmillion pounds of Waste Materials into the injection well, his firm had also\r\nrepresented</span><span> Du Pont for disposing 7.6 million pounds of Pontchartrain Facility wastes\r\ninto the well.  Evanick further agreed that, at times during the underlying litigation,\r\nhis firm represented two other defendants responsible for commingled wastes at the\r\ninjection well.  In determining the amount of defense costs properly chargeable to\r\nShell,</span><span> Evanick explained that he first identified defense costs “that did not relate to\r\nWaste Materials,” i.e., those defense costs that solely related to the Pontchartrain\r\nFacility wastes or wastes generated by the other represented defendants.  Du Pont did\r\nnot seek any of these defense costs from Shell.  Next, Evanick identified defense\r\ncosts for which Shell was solely responsible.  Du Pont sought to recover 100% of\r\nthese defense</span><span> costs from Shell.  Evanick explained, for example, that these defense\r\n</span><span>costs included costs associated with reviewing documents that related only to the\r\nMobile Facility.  Evanick was then left with a remaining pool of defense costs that\r\nwere “impossible” to segregate or assign either as solely related to Waste Materials\r\nor non-Waste Materials, i.e., claims related to Pontchartrain Facility wastes and\r\nwastes generated by other represented defendants.  Evanick explained that attributing\r\nthese defense </span><span>costs in such a manner was impossible because of the commingling of\r\nall of the defendants’ wastes at the injection well, the common claims asserted by the\r\nplaintiffs, and the common defenses raised by the defendants.  Thus, Evanick opined\r\nthat all of these remaining defense </span><span>costs “related to” Waste Materials, even if they\r\nalso related to non-Waste Materials.  In support of this opinion, Evanick stated that,\r\neven if Du Pont had been sued only in regard to the Waste Materials, Du Pont still\r\nwould have incurred all of the remaining pool of defense </span><span>costs</span><span> because he still would\r\nhave performed all of the underlying legal services in defense of these claims on Du\r\nPont’s behalf.  </span><span>As such, Evanick contended that Shell was contractually responsible\r\nfor all of these defense </span><span>costs related to Waste Materials, which amounted to over one\r\nmillion dollars, under the indemnity agreement</span><span>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Nevertheless, Evanick stated that because his firm also represented Du Pont\r\nand, at times, other defendants in regard to commingled wastes, and because Du Pont,\r\nShell, and these other defendants all benefitted from these defense </span><span>costs,  Du Pont\r\nsought from Shell only a prorated share of these </span><span>costs.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Evanick explained, in\r\nconsiderable detail, the method he used to determine the appropriate pro rated share\r\nthat was charged to Shell.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Specifically, after setting aside the defense </span><span>costs unrelated\r\nto Waste Materials as well as defense </span><span>costs solely related to Waste Materials, Evanick\r\nset forth the total annual defense </span><span>costs incurred in defense of claims related to Waste\r\nMaterials, detailed the time periods for which he also represented parties other than\r\nShell in regard to non-Waste Materials, assigned a percentage of defense </span><span>costs based\r\non these factors related to Waste Materials for which Shell would be responsible, and\r\ncalculated the reasonable amount of these costs allocable to Shell for each year</span><span>. \r\nEvanick also calculated, based on these factors, a percentage of the settlement costs\r\nfor which Shell was responsible.  In sum, Evanick stated that Shell was responsible\r\nfor $458,212.60 in defense costs and $40,000 in settlement costs</span><span> for a total of\r\n$498,212.60</span><span> in allocated defense and settlement costs.</span><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span></span><span>In its summary judgment motion, Shell reiterated its position that it was\r\nresponsible only for “costs <i>actually </i>related to wastes from the Mobile Facility” in the\r\namount of $31,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its final judgment, the trial court overruled Shell’s objections to Du Pont’s\r\nsummary judgment evidence.  However, after finding that there were no contested\r\nissues of material fact, the trial court denied Du Pont’s summary judgment motion\r\n“except as to $31,00 in damages,” and granted Shell summary judgment “as to\r\ndefenses and denied as to claims for affirmative relief.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Standard of Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To prevail on a summary judgment motion, a movant has the burden of proving\r\nthat it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that there is no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact. <span>Tex. R. Civ. P. </span>166a(c); <i>Cathey v. Booth</i>, 900 S.W.2d 339, 341 (Tex.\r\n1995).  When both parties move for summary judgment and the trial court grants one\r\nmotion and denies the other, the reviewing court should review the summary\r\njudgment evidence presented by both sides and determine all questions presented and\r\nrender the judgment that the trial court should have rendered. <i> Tex.

However,\r\nthe parties seek opposing constructions of the indemnity provisions based on the term\r\n“related to.”  Du Pont asserts that the indemnity provisions mean exactly what they\r\nsay, i.e., that Shell owed Du Pont indemnity for costs for claims <i>related to </i>Waste\r\nMaterials.  Shell, on the other hand, contends that the plain meaning of the indemnity\r\nprovisions “leaves no doubt that Shell owed Du Pont indemnity only for costs that\r\nwere <i>actually related to</i>” the Waste Materials.  Similarly, in its pre-litigation\r\ncorrespondence, trial court pleadings, and partial summary judgment motion, Shell\r\nasserted that its indemnity obligations applied only to defense costs “<i>directly\r\nattributable</i>,” “<i>solely related to</i>,” </span><span>“<i>specifically related to</i>,” or “<i>directly related to</i>” the\r\nWaste Materials. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Our focus is on determining the intent of the parties as expressed in the\r\nagreement.  <i>Crowder</i>, 186 S.W.3d at 119.  </span><span>The DTCA defines “claims” to include “all\r\nclaims, suits, actions, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s\r\nfees) including but not limited to injury, disease or death of persons or damage to\r\nproperty including environmental damage.”  The term “related to” means to “have\r\nreference to” or “concern.”  <span>The New Oxford American Dictionary </span>1437 (2001);\r\n<i>see also Univ. of Tex. Law School v. Tex. Legal Found.</i>, 958 S.W.2d 479, 483 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Austin 1997, no pet.) (“Ordinarily, the words “related to” mean “pertaining\r\nto,” “associated with,” or “connected with.”) (citing <span>Webster’s Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary </span>1916 (Philip E. Gove ed. 1986); <span>Black’s Law\r\nDictionary </span>1288 (6th ed. 1990)).  Here, the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation\r\nalleged that they were harmed by commingled wastes shipped to the injection well\r\nby hundreds of defendants, including Du Pont.  Du Pont was sued, in part, for its\r\nshipment of Waste Materials to the well.  Thus, the plaintiffs’ claims against Du Pont,\r\nand the defense costs expended to defend Du Pont in regard to these claims, related\r\nto Waste Materials and triggered Shell’s indemnity obligations.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>While Shell appears to agree with this general proposition, it proposes a\r\nconstruction of the indemnity provisions that is contrary to the provisions’ plain\r\nterms, rendering </span><span>Shell’s indemnity obligations, at least under these circumstances,\r\nvirtually worthless.  Shell sought, and effectively obtained, a summary judgment on\r\nthe basis that it owed Du Pont indemnity only for defense costs <i>solely </i>related to\r\nWaste Materials.  Yet, this qualifying terminology is nowhere in the indemnity\r\nagreement.  </span><span>Here, although Du Pont was sued both for the disposing of Waste\r\nMaterials and non-Waste Materials into the well, it is undisputed that these wastes\r\nwere commingled in the well and were alleged to have collectively harmed the\r\nplaintiffs.  Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that there was (1) a small amount\r\nof segregable defense costs that did not relate to the Waste Materials (for which it did\r\nnot seek to recover), (2) a small amount of segregable defense </span><span>costs solely related to\r\nWaste Materials (for which it sought to fully recover), and (3) a remaining pool of\r\ndefense </span><span>costs that Du Pont would have expended even if it had only been sued in\r\nregard to the Waste Materials (rendering the claims and the costs associated with\r\ndefending these claims necessarily related to Waste Materials).  Under the plain terms\r\nof the DTCA, </span><span>Shell was not merely responsible for the minimal amount of defense\r\ncosts solely related to Waste Materials.  </span><span>We enforce the DTCA as written, reject\r\nShell’s assertion that it is liable only for defense </span><span>costs in the amount of $31,000 <i>solely\r\nrelated </i>to Waste Materials, and hold that Shell was contractually required to\r\nindemnify Du Pont for defense </span><span>costs expended in defense of the claims related to\r\nWaste Materials, even if those costs also benefitted the defense of claims related to\r\nnon-Waste Materials.  <i>See Lehmann</i>, 76 S.W.3d at 561–62 (construing indemnity\r\nprovision to provide common sense reading and giving terms in indemnity agreement\r\nplain, ordinary, and generally accepted meaning). </span><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>  <span>         </span>Although Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that it expended\r\napproximately one million dollars in costs that </span><span>advanced the defense of claims related\r\nto both Waste and non-Waste Materials, Du Pont did not seek to recover all of these\r\ncosts.  Rather, because these defense </span><span>costs related both to Waste Materials and non-Waste Materials and, accordingly, benefitted multiple parties, Du Pont sought an\r\nallocated portion of these defense </span><span>costs from Shell in the amount of $498,212.60\r\n(including $40,000 in allocated settlement costs)</span><span>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Both parties cite <i>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa</i>, as controlling authority\r\non the issue of segregation.  212 S.W.3d 299 (Tex. 2006). </span><span> In <i>Tony Gullo Motors</i>,\r\nChapa, the plaintiff, asserted claims for breach of contract, violations of the\r\nDeceptive Trade Practices Act, and fraud.  <i>Id.</i> at 303.  The jury awarded Chapa\r\n$20,000 in attorney’s fees “in this case,” and </span><span>Tony Gullo Motors objected on the\r\nbasis that attorney’s fees were not recoverable on Chapa’s fraud claim.  <i>Id</i>. at 310. \r\nNoting that “fee claimants have always been required to segregate fees between\r\nclaims for which they are recoverable and claims for which they are not,” the court\r\nsought to rein in an exception that it had previously recognized </span><span>for “inextricably\r\nintertwined” fees.  <i>Id</i>. at 311 (citing </span><i><span>Stewart Title Guaranty Co. v. Sterling</span></i><span>, 822\r\nS.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex. 1991)). </span><span> Finding that this “inextricably intertwined” exception had\r\nbeen difficult to consistently apply and had </span><span>flooded courts with claims for otherwise\r\n</span><span>unrecoverable fees, the supreme court explained that to the extent it suggested in\r\n<i>Sterling</i> “that a common set of underlying facts necessarily made all claims arising\r\ntherefrom ‘inseparable’ and all legal fees recoverable, it went too far.”  <i>Id</i>. at 313.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The court “reaffirm[ed] the rule that if any attorney’s fees <i>relate solely </i>to a\r\nclaim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable\r\nfrom unrecoverable fees.”  <i>Id</i>. (emphasis added).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span><span> But the court also noted that,</span></p>\r\n<p><span>[M]any if not most legal fees in such cases <i>cannot and need not be\r\nprecisely allocated to one claim or the other</i>. Many of the services\r\ninvolved in preparing a contract or DTPA claim for trial <i>must still be\r\nincurred if tort claims are appended to it</i>; <i>adding the latter claims does\r\nnot render the former services unrecoverable</i>. Requests for standard\r\ndisclosures, proof of background facts, depositions of the primary\r\nactors, discovery motions and hearings, voir dire of the jury, and a host\r\nof other services <i>may be necessary whether a claim is filed alone or with\r\nothers. To the extent such services would have been incurred on a\r\nrecoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because they\r\ndo double service</i>.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id</i>. (emphasis added). </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><i>Tony Gullo Motors</i>, although distinguishable from the instant case because Du\r\nPont is not seeking to recover intertwined fees on separate, nonrecoverable claims,\r\nsupports Du Pont’s indemnification request for defense </span><span>costs expended to defend\r\nClaims that relate to Waste Materials, even if such costs do not <i>solely relate </i>to Waste\r\nMaterials.  In <i>Tony Gullo Motors</i>, the court confirmed that “it is only <i>when discrete\r\nlegal services </i>advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable claim that they are so\r\nintertwined that they need not be segregated.”  <i>Id</i>. at 313–14 (emphasis added). </span><span> \r\nSimilarly, here, Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that, based on the\r\ncommonality of the claims and defenses and the commingling of the Waste Materials\r\nwith the non-Waste Materials, even if Du Pont had been sued only in regard to Waste\r\nMaterials,</span><span> Du Pont would have incurred defense costs for the same discrete legal\r\nservices for which it sought recovery from Shell. Because the discrete legal services\r\nprovided to Du Pont for which it seeks recovery advanced both Du Pont’s defense for\r\nclaims related to Waste Materials as well as claims related to non-Waste Materials,\r\n<i>Tony Gullo Motors </i>supports Du Pont’s claims for recovery of the requested defense\r\ncosts fees from Shell.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>This Court has recently discussed a similar issue in regard to segregation in\r\n<i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc. v. First Seismic Corp.</i>, No. 01-04-00077-CV, 2006 WL\r\n374257, at *14 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 16, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.). \r\nIn <i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc.</i>,<i> </i>an indemnity action, the appellant complained that </span><span>the\r\namount of attorney’s fees and costs awarded to the appellee included amounts\r\n“attributable solely to defending” a third party for whom recovery of fees and costs\r\nwas not authorized under the relevant agreement.  <i>Id</i>.  We noted, however, that the\r\ntrial court’s record actually reflected that the fees and costs directly allocable to the\r\nthird party had been “promptly identified, segregated and noted as nonrecoverable.” \r\n<i>Id</i>.  We further noted that, in response to the appellant’s complaints in the trial court,\r\nthe appellee had proportionately reduced the claimed amounts of attorney’s fees and\r\ncosts based on “percentages of time allocable to [the] defense” of this third party.  <i>Id</i>. \r\nFinally, and most similar to the instant case, we noted that although the appellee had\r\nproportionately reduced the amount of requested fees and costs, it had not made any\r\nproportionate reduction for fees and costs that it “<i>would have incurred in any event\r\n</i>because [the claimed fees] related” not only to the defense of the party (for whom\r\nrecovery of fees and costs was not authorized) but also to its defense (for which\r\nrecovery of fees and costs was authorized). <i> Id</i>. (emphasis added).  We affirmed the\r\naward, stating that the appellant had not refuted the evidence that all of the claimed\r\nfees and costs were “integral to” the appellee’s defense, even though some of the fees\r\nand costs also related to the defense of the third party for whom recovery of such\r\ncosts was not authorized.  <i>Id</i>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>As in <i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc.</i>, here, the record establishes that Du Pont\r\nsegregated defense costs expended in defense of claims solely related to non-Waste\r\nMaterials—including any such defense costs solely related to the defense of claims\r\nrelated to Pontchartrain Facility waste and wastes generated by the other represented\r\ndefendants.  Du Pont also segregated a limited amount of fees expended to defend\r\nclaims solely related to Waste Materials.  Du Pont was then left with a remaining pool\r\nof defense costs that related to Waste Materials, even though such defense costs also\r\nadvanced the defense of claims related to non-Waste Materials.  </span><span>Again, although Du\r\nPont might have been entitled to seek recovery of these defense costs under the plain\r\nterms of the agreement, Du Pont instead sought a percentage of these defense costs\r\nafter analyzing the time periods for which Evanick’s firm represented Du Pont’s\r\ninterest in regard to the 7.6 million pounds of non-Waste Materials as well as the time\r\nperiods Evanick’s firm represented other defendants who were responsible for\r\ncommingled wastes at the injection well.  After considering the above facts, isolating\r\nthe defense costs related to Waste Materials, and assigning Shell an appropriate\r\npercentage of these defense costs on an annual basis, Evanick concluded that Shell\r\nowed Du Pont, under its indemnity agreement, defense costs (including reasonable\r\nattorney’s fees) and settlement costs in the amount of $498,212.60.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Shell complains that Evanick’s affidavits are conclusory, constitute\r\ninadmissible hearsay, improperly attempt to invade the province of the jury “to rule\r\non the unambiguous contractual indemnity provision at issue,” and, thus, are\r\nincompetent and inadmissible summary judgment evidence.  Shell claims that, in his\r\nthird affidavit, Evanick could show only that approximately $30,000 of Du Pont’s\r\ndefense costs “actually related” to Waste Materials.  We note first, with the majority\r\nof these “evidentiary” complaints, Shell simply recasts its contention that it should\r\nonly be liable for defense costs solely related to Waste Materials.  We have rejected\r\nthis contention</span><span>.  Second, Evanick’s affidavits are not conclusory.  The term\r\n“conclusory” is defined as “[e]xpressing a factual inference without stating the\r\nunderlying facts on which the inference is based.” <span>Black’s Law Dictionary </span>284\r\n(7th ed. 2001); <i>see also Interconex, Inc. v. Ugarov</i>, 224 S.W.3d 523, 532 n.2 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet).  Evanick testified that he based his affidavit\r\non his personal knowledge, he had personally reviewed all invoices and fee and cost\r\nentries, and he isolated the defense costs that related to Waste Materials.   Evanick\r\nattached to his affidavit all invoices for legal services performed and defense costs\r\nincurred.  Evanick explained that the majority of the defense costs expended in\r\ndefending claims related to Waste Materials could not be segregated from the costs\r\nexpended in defending claims related to non-Waste Materials, the defense costs\r\nrelated to the general defense of the underlying action, and such costs included\r\npreparing for and attending depositions of fact witnesses and experts.  Evanick also\r\nstated that the plaintiffs and defendants in the underlying litigation asserted common\r\nclaims and defenses and that the defendants in the underlying litigation formed a joint\r\ndefense group to present a uniform defense.  Evanick then provided a detailed\r\nanalysis of how he allocated certain percentages of the defense costs to Shell. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We hold that the trial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment motion\r\nand denying Du Pont’s summary judgment motion because Du Pont conclusively\r\nestablished that it incurred over one million dollars in defense costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials, Du Pont properly sought a percentage of these defense costs from Shell,\r\nand Shell owed Du Pont an allocated portion of defense costs in the amount of \r\n$498,212.60</span><span> (including $40,000 in allocable settlement costs).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Du Pont’s first and second issues.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>Indemnification for Settlement Costs</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its third issue, Du Pont contends that the trial court should have awarded it\r\n“a share of the settlement funds it paid to resolve ‘Claims related to Waste\r\nMaterials.’” In response, Shell asserts that Du Pont never produced any competent\r\nsummary judgment evidence that the settlement was related to Waste Materials.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>For a settling indemnitee to recover an amount of the settlement from its\r\nindemnitor, the indemnitee must show its potential liability to a claimant and show\r\nthat the settlement was reasonable, prudent, and made in good faith under the\r\ncircumstances.  <i>Amerada Hess Corp. v.

However, having rejected Shell’s\r\ncontention, we hold that the trial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment\r\nmotion and denying Du Pont’s summary judgment motion because Du Pont\r\nconclusively established that its settlement costs related to Waste Materials, it\r\nproperly sought a reasonable percentage of these settlement costs from Shell, and\r\nShell owed it an allocated portion of settlement costs in the amount of  $40,000</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Du Pont’s third issue.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Recovery of Costs for Indemnity Action</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its fourth issue, Du Pont contends that the trial court should have awarded\r\nit “defense costs for its prosecution of its indemnity claim.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that it sustained $242,620.90 in\r\n“attorney’s fees and costs” in prosecuting its indemnity claim against Shell.  Shell\r\ndoes not challenge the reasonableness or necessity of the amount of fees or costs, or\r\neven Du Pont’s entitlement to recover these fees and costs upon Shell’s breach of the\r\nindemnity provisions.  Rather, it claims that Du Pont is not entitled to these fees and\r\ncosts because it was not entitled to indemnity for fees and costs except those solely\r\nrelated to the Waste Materials.  Shell asserts that it had already agreed to pay Du Pont\r\nthis amount—$31,000.  Having rejected Shell’s contention, and having held that the\r\ntrial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment and in denying Du Pont\r\nsummary judgment on its claim for defense and settlement costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials, we further hold that the trial court erred in denying Du Pont summary\r\njudgment on Du Pont’s claim for fees and costs in prosecuting its indemnity claim. \r\nWe further hold that Du Pont has conclusively established that it is entitled to recover\r\nits fees and costs for prosecution of its indemnity claim in the amount of </span><span>$242,620.90. \r\n<i>See </i><span>Tex.

Du Pont De Nemours and Company (“Du Pont”), challenges the\r\ntrial court’s </span><span>rendition of summary judgment</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> in favor of appellee, Shell Oil Company\r\n(“Shell”), in Du Pont’s suit against Shell for breach of an indemnification agreement. \r\nIn four issues, Du Pont contends that Shell owed Du Pont a duty to indemnify it for\r\n“defense costs that advanced both [] the defense of Shell related to Waste Materials\r\nand [] the defense of Du Pont (or another defendant) related to waste from another\r\nfacility”; Du Pont properly allocated a percentage of these “defense costs” to Shell;\r\nDu Pont properly segregated the defense costs “that did not relate to the defense of\r\nWaste Materials” from the remainder of the defense costs that did relate to Waste\r\nMaterials; Shell owed Du Pont a duty to indemnify it for “a share of the settlement\r\nfunds it paid to resolve ‘Claims related to Waste Materials’”; and the trial court\r\nshould have awarded it</span><span> “defense costs for its prosecution of its indemnity claim.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We reverse and render. <span>Factual and Procedural Background</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Pursuant to a Detergents Toll Conversion Agreement (“DTCA”), Du Pont\r\nmanufactured Shop Ligand, a chemical, at a facility in Mobile, Alabama, using\r\nShell’s raw materials and for Shell’s use.  Under the DTCA, Shell retained ownership\r\nof the wastes and waste by-products from the Shop Ligand production process,\r\nreferred to by the parties in the DTCA as the “Waste Materials.”  Moreover, Shell\r\ndesignated the transporter and the disposal site of the Waste Materials and reimbursed\r\nDu Pont for transportation and disposal costs. Finally, article 15 of the DTCA\r\ncontained two indemnity provisions, which generally provided that Shell would\r\n“defend and indemnify Du Pont . . . against all Claims related to Waste Materials</span></span><span>.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Du Pont shipped over 12 million pounds of Waste Materials to an injection\r\nwell in Bayou Sorrell, Louisiana.  The injection well subsequently became the subject\r\nof multiple lawsuits ultimately consolidated into a class action suit in federal district\r\ncourt.  Du Pont and Shell, as well as hundreds of other defendants, were sued in this\r\nunderlying litigation for their roles in generating and disposing of wastes at the\r\ninjection well.  The plaintiffs in the underlying litigation did not identify any\r\nparticular defendant as responsible for any specific waste.  Rather, the plaintiffs\r\nalleged that all of the defendants’ wastes commingled at the site and these\r\ncommingled wastes collectively harmed them. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>All parties agree that Shell and Du Pont were sued, in part, for their roles in\r\ngenerating and transporting Waste Materials to the injection well; both Shell and Du\r\nPont were also sued for claims unrelated to Waste Materials.  Du Pont was sued for\r\nshipping to the injection well (1) the Waste Materials and (2) 7.6 million pounds of\r\nwaste from its “Pontchartrain Facility” in La Place, Louisiana.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>After being sued, Du Pont requested that Shell, pursuant to the DTCA, </span><span> provide\r\nit a defense and indemnity in the underlying litigation.  Although Du Pont requested\r\na response within 30 days,  Shell responded to this demand over one year later.  Shell\r\nrecognized </span><span>its “responsibility” for the Waste Materials, but denied responsibility for\r\nwaste from other facilities.   Shell stated that it would not “defend or indemnify any\r\njudgment against Du Pont for other wastes” and offered Du Pont a limited indemnity,\r\nconditioned upon Du Pont’s waiving its right to recover settlement payments if the\r\nplaintiffs and defendants in the underlying litigation accomplished an “early\r\nsettlement.”  Shell also indicated that it was unwilling to reimburse Du Pont for any\r\ndefense costs expended prior to Shell’s offer.  Du Pont rejected Shell’s conditional\r\nindemnity and continued its defense.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The plaintiffs and defendants eventually settled the underlying litigation. \r\nThereafter, Shell sent Du Pont another letter stating that it intended to indemnify Du\r\nPont only for shipments of Waste Materials.  Shell asserted that the parties needed to\r\n“determine how to split out those costs <i>solely </i>related to the waste shipped from [the\r\nMobile Facility] on [Shell’s] behalf.” (Emphasis added.)  Shell requested that Du Pont\r\nsubmit its costs with supporting documentation, and, in December 2004, Du Pont sent\r\nShell a letter breaking down its annual defense costs.  Du Pont then requested that\r\nShell pay (1) a percentage of defense costs that related to both Waste Materials and\r\nnon-Waste Materials and (2) $31,000 in costs that solely related to Waste Materials\r\nfor which Shell was “solely responsible.”  Shell refused to pay any amounts other\r\nthan the $31,000 in defense costs solely related to Waste Materials. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Du Pont filed suit, asserting that Shell breached its duty to defend and\r\nindemnify it in the underlying litigation.  Shell answered, and filed a motion for\r\npartial summary judgment, seeking a declaration that it owed Du Pont indemnity\r\n“only for defense costs <i>directly </i>related”<i> </i>to Waste Materials, and not a percentage of\r\ncosts incurred by Du Pont “in its overall defense.” (Emphasis added.)  The trial court\r\ngranted Shell partial summary judgment, but in its order it simply tracked the\r\nlanguage of the DTCA, declaring that Shell was required to indemnify Du Pont for\r\n“defense costs and settlement funds per [s]ection 15 of the [DTCA] incurred by Du\r\nPont which are related to the Waste Materials.”  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The parties then filed cross motions for summary judgment.  In its summary\r\njudgment motion, Du Pont argued that the DTCA was unambiguous and required\r\nShell to defend and indemnify Du Pont for the majority of defense costs expended in\r\nthe underlying litigation because the defense costs “related to” Waste Materials.  Du\r\nPont attached to its motion the affidavit of Bruce Evanick, Du Pont’s counsel, and Du\r\nPont later filed several supplemental affidavits from Evanick.  In these affidavits,\r\nEvanick explained that pursuant to the DTCA, Du Pont was seeking to recover from\r\nShell (1) $498,212.60 in “reasonable and necessary defense costs (including\r\nattorney’s fees and other defense costs)” and settlement costs, which represented only\r\n</span><span>“an allocated portion” of its total defense and settlement costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials and (2) $224,620.90 for “attorney’s fees and costs” incurred in prosecuting\r\nits indemnity claim against Shell.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In regard to Du Pont’s claim for defense and settlement costs of the underlying\r\nlitigation, </span><span>Evanick agreed </span><span>that, in addition to representing Du Pont for disposing 12\r\nmillion pounds of Waste Materials into the injection well, his firm had also\r\nrepresented</span><span> Du Pont for disposing 7.6 million pounds of Pontchartrain Facility wastes\r\ninto the well.  Evanick further agreed that, at times during the underlying litigation,\r\nhis firm represented two other defendants responsible for commingled wastes at the\r\ninjection well.  In determining the amount of defense costs properly chargeable to\r\nShell,</span><span> Evanick explained that he first identified defense costs “that did not relate to\r\nWaste Materials,” i.e., those defense costs that solely related to the Pontchartrain\r\nFacility wastes or wastes generated by the other represented defendants.  Du Pont did\r\nnot seek any of these defense costs from Shell.  Next, Evanick identified defense\r\ncosts for which Shell was solely responsible.  Du Pont sought to recover 100% of\r\nthese defense</span><span> costs from Shell.  Evanick explained, for example, that these defense\r\n</span><span>costs included costs associated with reviewing documents that related only to the\r\nMobile Facility.  Evanick was then left with a remaining pool of defense costs that\r\nwere “impossible” to segregate or assign either as solely related to Waste Materials\r\nor non-Waste Materials, i.e., claims related to Pontchartrain Facility wastes and\r\nwastes generated by other represented defendants.  Evanick explained that attributing\r\nthese defense </span><span>costs in such a manner was impossible because of the commingling of\r\nall of the defendants’ wastes at the injection well, the common claims asserted by the\r\nplaintiffs, and the common defenses raised by the defendants.  Thus, Evanick opined\r\nthat all of these remaining defense </span><span>costs “related to” Waste Materials, even if they\r\nalso related to non-Waste Materials.  In support of this opinion, Evanick stated that,\r\neven if Du Pont had been sued only in regard to the Waste Materials, Du Pont still\r\nwould have incurred all of the remaining pool of defense </span><span>costs</span><span> because he still would\r\nhave performed all of the underlying legal services in defense of these claims on Du\r\nPont’s behalf.  </span><span>As such, Evanick contended that Shell was contractually responsible\r\nfor all of these defense </span><span>costs related to Waste Materials, which amounted to over one\r\nmillion dollars, under the indemnity agreement</span><span>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Nevertheless, Evanick stated that because his firm also represented Du Pont\r\nand, at times, other defendants in regard to commingled wastes, and because Du Pont,\r\nShell, and these other defendants all benefitted from these defense </span><span>costs,  Du Pont\r\nsought from Shell only a prorated share of these </span><span>costs.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Evanick explained, in\r\nconsiderable detail, the method he used to determine the appropriate pro rated share\r\nthat was charged to Shell.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Specifically, after setting aside the defense </span><span>costs unrelated\r\nto Waste Materials as well as defense </span><span>costs solely related to Waste Materials, Evanick\r\nset forth the total annual defense </span><span>costs incurred in defense of claims related to Waste\r\nMaterials, detailed the time periods for which he also represented parties other than\r\nShell in regard to non-Waste Materials, assigned a percentage of defense </span><span>costs based\r\non these factors related to Waste Materials for which Shell would be responsible, and\r\ncalculated the reasonable amount of these costs allocable to Shell for each year</span><span>. \r\nEvanick also calculated, based on these factors, a percentage of the settlement costs\r\nfor which Shell was responsible.  In sum, Evanick stated that Shell was responsible\r\nfor $458,212.60 in defense costs and $40,000 in settlement costs</span><span> for a total of\r\n$498,212.60</span><span> in allocated defense and settlement costs.</span><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span></span><span>In its summary judgment motion, Shell reiterated its position that it was\r\nresponsible only for “costs <i>actually </i>related to wastes from the Mobile Facility” in the\r\namount of $31,000.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its final judgment, the trial court overruled Shell’s objections to Du Pont’s\r\nsummary judgment evidence.  However, after finding that there were no contested\r\nissues of material fact, the trial court denied Du Pont’s summary judgment motion\r\n“except as to $31,00 in damages,” and granted Shell summary judgment “as to\r\ndefenses and denied as to claims for affirmative relief.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Standard of Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To prevail on a summary judgment motion, a movant has the burden of proving\r\nthat it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and that there is no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact. <span>Tex.

Shell, on the other hand, contends that the plain meaning of the indemnity\r\nprovisions “leaves no doubt that Shell owed Du Pont indemnity only for costs that\r\nwere <i>actually related to</i>” the Waste Materials.  Similarly, in its pre-litigation\r\ncorrespondence, trial court pleadings, and partial summary judgment motion, Shell\r\nasserted that its indemnity obligations applied only to defense costs “<i>directly\r\nattributable</i>,” “<i>solely related to</i>,” </span><span>“<i>specifically related to</i>,” or “<i>directly related to</i>” the\r\nWaste Materials. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Our focus is on determining the intent of the parties as expressed in the\r\nagreement.  <i>Crowder</i>, 186 S.W.3d at 119.  </span><span>The DTCA defines “claims” to include “all\r\nclaims, suits, actions, liabilities, losses and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s\r\nfees) including but not limited to injury, disease or death of persons or damage to\r\nproperty including environmental damage.”  The term “related to” means to “have\r\nreference to” or “concern.”  <span>The New Oxford American Dictionary </span>1437 (2001);\r\n<i>see also Univ. of Tex.

(“Ordinarily, the words “related to” mean “pertaining\r\nto,” “associated with,” or “connected with.”) (citing <span>Webster’s Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary </span>1916 (Philip E. Gove ed. 1986); <span>Black’s Law\r\nDictionary </span>1288 (6th ed. 1990)).  Here, the plaintiffs in the underlying litigation\r\nalleged that they were harmed by commingled wastes shipped to the injection well\r\nby hundreds of defendants, including Du Pont.  Du Pont was sued, in part, for its\r\nshipment of Waste Materials to the well.  Thus, the plaintiffs’ claims against Du Pont,\r\nand the defense costs expended to defend Du Pont in regard to these claims, related\r\nto Waste Materials and triggered Shell’s indemnity obligations.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>While Shell appears to agree with this general proposition, it proposes a\r\nconstruction of the indemnity provisions that is contrary to the provisions’ plain\r\nterms, rendering </span><span>Shell’s indemnity obligations, at least under these circumstances,\r\nvirtually worthless.  Shell sought, and effectively obtained, a summary judgment on\r\nthe basis that it owed Du Pont indemnity only for defense costs <i>solely </i>related to\r\nWaste Materials.  Yet, this qualifying terminology is nowhere in the indemnity\r\nagreement.  </span><span>Here, although Du Pont was sued both for the disposing of Waste\r\nMaterials and non-Waste Materials into the well, it is undisputed that these wastes\r\nwere commingled in the well and were alleged to have collectively harmed the\r\nplaintiffs.  Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that there was (1) a small amount\r\nof segregable defense costs that did not relate to the Waste Materials (for which it did\r\nnot seek to recover), (2) a small amount of segregable defense </span><span>costs solely related to\r\nWaste Materials (for which it sought to fully recover), and (3) a remaining pool of\r\ndefense </span><span>costs that Du Pont would have expended even if it had only been sued in\r\nregard to the Waste Materials (rendering the claims and the costs associated with\r\ndefending these claims necessarily related to Waste Materials).

Rather, because these defense </span><span>costs related both to Waste Materials and non-Waste Materials and, accordingly, benefitted multiple parties, Du Pont sought an\r\nallocated portion of these defense </span><span>costs from Shell in the amount of $498,212.60\r\n(including $40,000 in allocated settlement costs)</span><span>.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Both parties cite <i>Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.

Because the discrete legal services\r\nprovided to Du Pont for which it seeks recovery advanced both Du Pont’s defense for\r\nclaims related to Waste Materials as well as claims related to non-Waste Materials,\r\n<i>Tony Gullo Motors </i>supports Du Pont’s claims for recovery of the requested defense\r\ncosts fees from Shell.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span><span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>This Court has recently discussed a similar issue in regard to segregation in\r\n<i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc. v. First Seismic Corp.</i>, No. 01-04-00077-CV, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">374257</span></span>, at *14 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 16, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.). \r\nIn <i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc.</i>,<i> </i>an indemnity action, the appellant complained that </span><span>the\r\namount of attorney’s fees and costs awarded to the appellee included amounts\r\n“attributable solely to defending” a third party for whom recovery of fees and costs\r\nwas not authorized under the relevant agreement.  <i>Id</i>.  We noted, however, that the\r\ntrial court’s record actually reflected that the fees and costs directly allocable to the\r\nthird party had been “promptly identified, segregated and noted as nonrecoverable.” \r\n<i>Id</i>.  We further noted that, in response to the appellant’s complaints in the trial court,\r\nthe appellee had proportionately reduced the claimed amounts of attorney’s fees and\r\ncosts based on “percentages of time allocable to [the] defense” of this third party.  <i>Id</i>. \r\nFinally, and most similar to the instant case, we noted that although the appellee had\r\nproportionately reduced the amount of requested fees and costs, it had not made any\r\nproportionate reduction for fees and costs that it “<i>would have incurred in any event\r\n</i>because [the claimed fees] related” not only to the defense of the party (for whom\r\nrecovery of fees and costs was not authorized) but also to its defense (for which\r\nrecovery of fees and costs was authorized). <i> Id</i>. (emphasis added).  We affirmed the\r\naward, stating that the appellant had not refuted the evidence that all of the claimed\r\nfees and costs were “integral to” the appellee’s defense, even though some of the fees\r\nand costs also related to the defense of the third party for whom recovery of such\r\ncosts was not authorized.  <i>Id</i>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>As in <i>Devon SFS Operating, Inc.</i>, here, the record establishes that Du Pont\r\nsegregated defense costs expended in defense of claims solely related to non-Waste\r\nMaterials—including any such defense costs solely related to the defense of claims\r\nrelated to Pontchartrain Facility waste and wastes generated by the other represented\r\ndefendants.  Du Pont also segregated a limited amount of fees expended to defend\r\nclaims solely related to Waste Materials.  Du Pont was then left with a remaining pool\r\nof defense costs that related to Waste Materials, even though such defense costs also\r\nadvanced the defense of claims related to non-Waste Materials.  </span><span>Again, although Du\r\nPont might have been entitled to seek recovery of these defense costs under the plain\r\nterms of the agreement, Du Pont instead sought a percentage of these defense costs\r\nafter analyzing the time periods for which Evanick’s firm represented Du Pont’s\r\ninterest in regard to the 7.6 million pounds of non-Waste Materials as well as the time\r\nperiods Evanick’s firm represented other defendants who were responsible for\r\ncommingled wastes at the injection well.  After considering the above facts, isolating\r\nthe defense costs related to Waste Materials, and assigning Shell an appropriate\r\npercentage of these defense costs on an annual basis, Evanick concluded that Shell\r\nowed Du Pont, under its indemnity agreement, defense costs (including reasonable\r\nattorney’s fees) and settlement costs in the amount of $498,212.60.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Shell complains that Evanick’s affidavits are conclusory, constitute\r\ninadmissible hearsay, improperly attempt to invade the province of the jury “to rule\r\non the unambiguous contractual indemnity provision at issue,” and, thus, are\r\nincompetent and inadmissible summary judgment evidence.  Shell claims that, in his\r\nthird affidavit, Evanick could show only that approximately $30,000 of Du Pont’s\r\ndefense costs “actually related” to Waste Materials.  We note first, with the majority\r\nof these “evidentiary” complaints, Shell simply recasts its contention that it should\r\nonly be liable for defense costs solely related to Waste Materials.  We have rejected\r\nthis contention</span><span>.  Second, Evanick’s affidavits are not conclusory.  The term\r\n“conclusory” is defined as “[e]xpressing a factual inference without stating the\r\nunderlying facts on which the inference is based.” <span>Black’s Law Dictionary </span>284\r\n(7th ed. 2001); <i>see also Interconex, Inc. v.

Evanick testified that he based his affidavit\r\non his personal knowledge, he had personally reviewed all invoices and fee and cost\r\nentries, and he isolated the defense costs that related to Waste Materials.   Evanick\r\nattached to his affidavit all invoices for legal services performed and defense costs\r\nincurred.  Evanick explained that the majority of the defense costs expended in\r\ndefending claims related to Waste Materials could not be segregated from the costs\r\nexpended in defending claims related to non-Waste Materials, the defense costs\r\nrelated to the general defense of the underlying action, and such costs included\r\npreparing for and attending depositions of fact witnesses and experts.  Evanick also\r\nstated that the plaintiffs and defendants in the underlying litigation asserted common\r\nclaims and defenses and that the defendants in the underlying litigation formed a joint\r\ndefense group to present a uniform defense.  Evanick then provided a detailed\r\nanalysis of how he allocated certain percentages of the defense costs to Shell. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We hold that the trial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment motion\r\nand denying Du Pont’s summary judgment motion because Du Pont conclusively\r\nestablished that it incurred over one million dollars in defense costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials, Du Pont properly sought a percentage of these defense costs from Shell,\r\nand Shell owed Du Pont an allocated portion of defense costs in the amount of \r\n$498,212.60</span><span> (including $40,000 in allocable settlement costs).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Du Pont’s first and second issues.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>Indemnification for Settlement Costs</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its third issue, Du Pont contends that the trial court should have awarded it\r\n“a share of the settlement funds it paid to resolve ‘Claims related to Waste\r\nMaterials.’” In response, Shell asserts that Du Pont never produced any competent\r\nsummary judgment evidence that the settlement was related to Waste Materials.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>For a settling indemnitee to recover an amount of the settlement from its\r\nindemnitor, the indemnitee must show its potential liability to a claimant and show\r\nthat the settlement was reasonable, prudent, and made in good faith under the\r\ncircumstances.  <i>Amerada Hess Corp. v.

Tex. 2006).  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, although Shell has not challenged the reasonableness or good faith</span><span> of Du\r\nPont’s settlement, we conclude that  </span><span>Evanick’s affidavits provide undisputed evidence\r\nthat Du Pont settled claims related to Waste Material; the settlement was prudent,\r\nreasonable, and substantially less than the costs of a continued defense</span><span>; and the\r\nsettlement was made in good faith.  </span><span>Shell’s real complaint in this issue, and\r\nthroughout this appeal, is that because it is responsible only for defense costs incurred\r\nin defending claims solely related to Waste Materials ($31,000), it is not responsible\r\nfor any portion of Du Pont’s settlement costs.   However, having rejected Shell’s\r\ncontention, we hold that the trial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment\r\nmotion and denying Du Pont’s summary judgment motion because Du Pont\r\nconclusively established that its settlement costs related to Waste Materials, it\r\nproperly sought a reasonable percentage of these settlement costs from Shell, and\r\nShell owed it an allocated portion of settlement costs in the amount of  $40,000</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Du Pont’s third issue.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Recovery of Costs for Indemnity Action</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In its fourth issue, Du Pont contends that the trial court should have awarded\r\nit “defense costs for its prosecution of its indemnity claim.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, Du Pont presented undisputed evidence that it sustained $242,620.90 in\r\n“attorney’s fees and costs” in prosecuting its indemnity claim against Shell.  Shell\r\ndoes not challenge the reasonableness or necessity of the amount of fees or costs, or\r\neven Du Pont’s entitlement to recover these fees and costs upon Shell’s breach of the\r\nindemnity provisions.  Rather, it claims that Du Pont is not entitled to these fees and\r\ncosts because it was not entitled to indemnity for fees and costs except those solely\r\nrelated to the Waste Materials.  Shell asserts that it had already agreed to pay Du Pont\r\nthis amount—$31,000.  Having rejected Shell’s contention, and having held that the\r\ntrial court erred in granting Shell’s summary judgment and in denying Du Pont\r\nsummary judgment on its claim for defense and settlement costs related to Waste\r\nMaterials, we further hold that the trial court erred in denying Du Pont summary\r\njudgment on Du Pont’s claim for fees and costs in prosecuting its indemnity claim. \r\nWe further hold that Du Pont has conclusively established that it is entitled to recover\r\nits fees and costs for prosecution of its indemnity claim in the amount of </span><span>$242,620.90. \r\n<i>See </i><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. </span>§ 38.001 (Vernon Supp. 2006) (providing\r\nfor recovery of reasonable attorney’s fees, in addition to amount of damages and\r\ncosts, for prevailing party on breach of contract action); <i>see also Devon SFS\r\nOperating, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">374257</span></span>, at *11 (citing section 38.001 in affirming award\r\nof contractually authorized fees, expenses, and costs </span><span>to prevailing party in indemnity\r\naction)</span><span>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We sustain Du Pont’s fourth issue.<span>      </span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Conclusion</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>We reverse the judgment of the trial court in favor of Shell.
