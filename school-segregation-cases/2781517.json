See United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151 (2006); Pa. Dep’t\n\nof Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206 (1998). Plaintiff William Pierce—who is profoundly\n\ndeaf and communicates with American Sign Language—claims that prison officials in\n\nthe District of Columbia violated his right to be free from unlawful disability\n\ndiscrimination in 2012, when Pierce was incarcerated in the District’s Correctional\n\nTreatment Facility following his guilty plea to a simple assault that arose out of a\n\ndomestic dispute with his then-partner. The District’s prison staff was indisputably\n\naware that Pierce was deaf; however, during the entire 51-day period in which Pierce\n\nwas held in custody, no staff person ever assessed Pierce’s need for accommodation or\n\notherwise undertook to determine the type of assistance that he would need to\n\ncommunicate effectively with others during his incarceration. Instead, according to\n\nPierce, the District’s employees and contractors merely assumed that lip-reading and\n\fexchanging written notes would suffice, and they largely ignored his repeated requests\n\nfor an interpreter to assist him in interacting with other people. As a result, Pierce\n\nasserts that he was forced to serve his prison time in abject isolation, generally unaware\n\nof what was going on around him and unable to communicate effectively with prison\n\nofficials, prison doctors, his counselor, his teacher, or his fellow inmates. Pierce has\n\nfiled the instant lawsuit against the District under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nof 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (1990), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 12101–12213, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355\n\n(1973), codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–796, seeking damages for allegedly\n\nhaving been denied an effective means of receiving or imparting information at various\n\ncritical points during his period of incarceration, including medical appointments,\n\nrehabilitative classes, and meetings with prison officials. (See Compl., ECF No. 1,\n\n¶¶ 22, 49–50.) Pierce also maintains that he was held in solitary confinement as\n\npunishment for his repeated requests for an interpreter, and thus, that the District’s\n\nemployees and contractors retaliated against him in violation of federal law. (See id.\n\n¶¶ 30, 45, 51.)\n\n       Before this Court at present are the parties’ cross motions for summary\n\njudgment. (See Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. as to Claims I and II of the Compl., ECF\n\nNo. 47; Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 49.) The parties\n\nvehemently disagree about many of the facts related to this case—most notably,\n\nwhether Pierce actually had the ability to communicate effectively through lip-reading\n\nand written notes, and also whether Pierce actually requested an interpreter as an\n\naccommodation for his hearing disability. But in this Court’s view, only one fact is\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\ftruly material to the question of whether or not Pierce was discriminated against on the\n\nbasis of his disability and is thus entitled to summary judgment on his discrimination\n\nclaims (Claims I and II of the complaint), and that fact is entirely undisputed: when\n\nPierce first arrived at the prison facility, the District’s employees and contractors did\n\nnothing to evaluate Pierce’s need for accommodation, despite their knowledge that he\n\nwas disabled. They did not ask Pierce what type of auxiliary aids he needed. They did\n\nnot hire an expert to assess Pierce’s ability to communicate through written notes or lip-\n\nreading as opposed to sign language. They did not even consult the Department of\n\nCorrections’ own policies to figure out what types of accommodations are ordinarily\n\nprovided to inmates with hearing disabilities. Instead, they figuratively shrugged and\n\neffectively sat on their hands with respect to this plainly hearing-disabled person in\n\ntheir custody, presumably content to rely on their own uninformed beliefs about how\n\nbest to handle him and certainly failing to engage in any meaningful assessment of his\n\nneeds. This Court finds that, in so doing, the District denied Pierce meaningful access\n\nto prison services and intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his\n\ndisability in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, Pierce is entitled to summary judgment and\n\ncompensatory damages on Claims I and II of his complaint.\n\n       With respect to the District’s motion for summary judgment on Pierce’s\n\nretaliation claim (Claim III), this Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material\n\nfact regarding whether or not Pierce’s placement in solitary confinement was an act of\n\nunlawful retaliation—Pierce contends that prison employees were responding to his\n\nrepeated requests for an interpreter and the complaints he had made about the prison’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\ffailure to provide accommodations, while the District claims that Pierce was segregated\n\nfrom the general prison population in order to protect him from the violent threats of\n\nother inmates. Pierce’s retaliation claim thus involves a genuine dispute of fact that is\n\nnot appropriately resolved on summary judgment.\n\n       Accordingly, Pierce’s motion for summary judgment with respect to Claims I and\n\nII of the complaint will be GRANTED, and the District’s motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Claims I, II, and III will be DENIED. A separate order consistent with\n\nthis memorandum opinion will follow.\n\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Basic Facts †\n\n       William Pierce is a resident of the District of Columbia who is profoundly deaf\n\nand has other serious medical conditions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts\n\n(“Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 48-1, ¶ 1; Compl. ¶ 4.) Pierce can make sounds that\n\nare audible, but he cannot speak words, and American Sign Language (“ASL”) is his\n\nnative language. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 2, 3.) 1 Pierce relies on ASL to\n\ncommunicate with others—either by interacting directly with other persons who are\n\nusing ASL themselves, or through the use of a video conferencing device that involves\n\na remote interpreter. (See id. ¶¶ 8–9.) Pierce cannot, and does not, use a traditional\n\ntelephone; instead, he ordinarily uses ASL via videophone to communicate with hearing\n\nindividuals. (See id.) Moreover, because Pierce’s proficiency in reading and writing\n\n\n†\n  Certain facts have been redacted from this Memorandum Opinion by agreement of the parties. These\nredactions are represented herein by the characters “[******].”\n1\n ASL is a language comprised of hand motions, facial expressions, eye gazes, and body postures. (See\nPl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4.) Although many deaf people in the United States use ASL to communicate,\nASL’s syntax and grammar are not derived from English. (See id.)\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fEnglish is far below that of a hearing person, he rarely writes notes and only uses\n\ncellphone texting to convey simple, short messages. (See id. ¶¶ 7, 9.) Also, as with\n\nmany deaf individuals, Pierce has limited lip-reading ability. (See id. ¶¶ 10–11.)\n\n       At some point prior to February of 2012, Pierce was involved in a domestic\n\ndispute with his then-partner, David Holder, after which Pierce was arrested and\n\ncharged with simple assault. (See id. ¶ 46.) On February 1, 2012, a D.C. Superior\n\nCourt Judge sentenced Pierce to 60 days in jail, and committed him to the custody of\n\nthe District of Columbia Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to serve out his sentence\n\nin the District’s Correctional Treatment Facility (“CTF”). (See id.; see also Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts, ECF No. 50, ¶ 2.) 2 Pierce was then incarcerated at CTF from February\n\n2, 2012, until March 22, 2012. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 51; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 6.)\n\nHe resided in three different units during his incarceration: Medical 96 while he was in\n\ngeneral population, and then Medical 82 and the Special Management Unit when he was\n\nplaced into protective custody. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 50; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 159–165.) Pierce was in protective custody from February 23, 2012, to March 7,\n\n2012. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 102, 112; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 164, 172.)\n\n       It is undisputed that the District’s employees and contractors were all fully aware\n\nthat Pierce is deaf. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 69; Def.’s Controverting Stmt. of Facts\n\n(“Def.’s Cont. Facts”), ECF No. 61, ¶ 69.) However, no prison staff member assessed\n\nwhether, or to what extent, Pierce would need accommodations to ensure that he could\n\ncommunicate effectively with others during his incarceration. (See Hr’g Tr., ECF No.\n\n\n2\n The DOC is an agency of the District of Columbia that, among other things, oversees operation of the\nCTF, which is a minimum and medium security correctional facility. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 13,\n17.) The DOC has contracted a private prison company (the Corrections Corporation of America) to\nrun CTF. (See id. ¶ 14.)\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f80, at 52:3–4, 53:1–12.) Furthermore, Pierce was not provided with a qualified ASL\n\ninterpreter at any point during the entire 51-day period he spent in custody, including\n\nthe 14-day period that Pierce served in solitary confinement-like conditions.\n\n       B.     Disputed Issues\n\n       The parties vigorously disagree about how—and, more specifically, whether—\n\nPierce was actually able to communicate effectively with prison officials, health care\n\nproviders, teachers, and counselors during his incarceration. Pierce claims that he is\n\nnot skilled at reading lips when people are speaking English, nor can he skillfully\n\ninterpret notes that people have written to him in English. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.) Accordingly, Pierce asserts that he needs ASL interpretation in order\n\nto communicate effectively with people who do not know ASL. (See id. ¶ 12.) The\n\nDistrict disagrees, asserting that Pierce can communicate effectively in written English\n\nand through lip reading, primarily because Pierce appeared to understand what prison\n\nofficials said and wrote to him during his incarceration. (See Def.’s Cont. Facts ¶¶ 5, 7,\n\n8, 9; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 12–17, 28.) In the District’s view, then, exchanging\n\nwritten notes and lip reading were adequate means of effective communication for\n\nPierce while he was in custody. (See Def.’s Cont. Facts ¶¶ 8, 11, 82, 90.)\n\n       The parties also disagree about when—and whether—Pierce actually asked\n\nprison officials, health care providers, and class instructors to accommodate his hearing\n\ndisability by providing an interpreter to translate for him. Pierce claims that he\n\nrequested an interpreter at his initial medical intake interview, at inmate orientation, in\n\nhis rehabilitation classes, and at all medical appointments. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 60, 88, 98.) By contrast, the District insists that Pierce only requested a sign\n\nlanguage interpreter for certain sessions of his anger management/substance abuse\n\n\n                                             6\n\fclass. (See Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 19–21, 54, 57.) From the District’s perspective,\n\nhaving not requested an interpreter for most of the interactions that he had with prison\n\nofficials and others, Pierce is not entitled to contend that the District violated the law\n\nby failing to provide him with an interpreter for those interactions. (See Def.’s Opp’n\n\nto Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (“Def.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 60, at 1–3.) 3\n\n        These two issues—Pierce’s ability to communicate effectively in English and the\n\nextent to which he requested an ASL interpreter—lie at the heart of the parties’ cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment. As explained fully in the analysis section below, this\n\nCourt ultimately finds that these disputed issues are immaterial to the Court’s\n\nconclusion that Pierce was subjected to disability discrimination while he was in DOC\n\ncustody. (See Part III.A.1, infra.) However, for present purposes, the parties’ opposing\n\nviews regarding Pierce’s linguistic abilities and requests for accommodation provide\n\nimportant context for understanding the parties’ allegations regarding Pierce’s prison\n\nexperience. The specific disputes of fact center on whether Pierce had communication\n\ndifficulties with respect to (1) the prison facility’s medical intake and health services,\n\n(2) his inmate rehabilitation classes, (3) the protective custody procedures that were\n\nemployed in his case, and (4) the prison’s provision of telecommunications, official\n\nnotifications, and visitation. What follows is a brief summary of the parties’ conflicting\n\ndescriptions of Pierce’s custodial experience in regard to these matters.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  All citations to pages in documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the\nCourt’s electronic filing system assigns.\n\n\n\n                                                    7\n\f                1.      Pierce’s Ability To Communicate Effectively During Medical\n                        Intake And Health Processes\n\n        Immediately after Pierce was sentenced and taken into DOC custody, he was sent\n\nto the District’s Central Detention Facility for a medical screening and examination, in\n\naccordance with ordinary inmate intake procedures. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 47, 88;\n\nDef.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 8, 9.) This physical was conducted by medical professionals\n\nfrom Unity Healthcare—a private, non-profit entity that contracts with the District of\n\nColumbia to provide comprehensive health care services to inmates. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 88; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 8, 9.) The parties disagree about whether Pierce\n\nrequested, or even needed, an ASL interpreter at this initial intake evaluation and also\n\nat the many subsequent interactions that Pierce had with prison medical professionals in\n\norder to manage his significant and chronic medical conditions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶¶ 87–90; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 27–31.) 4\n\n        According to Pierce, during the initial intake process and at his subsequent\n\nmedical appointments and interventions, prison medical personnel simply assumed they\n\nwere effectively communicating with him through the exchange of written notes and\n\ngestures, despite his request for an ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 88–89,\n\n97–98, 101; see also Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Stmt. of Facts (“Pl.’s Cont. Facts”), ECF No.\n\n59-2, ¶¶ 28–29.) For example, Pierce claims that, at the initial intake meeting, Pierce\n\nwrote to Dr. Fidelis Doh (the doctor who conducted his intake interview) that he needed\n\nan ASL interpreter because he had complicated health issues to explain, such as HIV,\n\n\n\n4\n  Pierce has both HIV and [******]. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 87; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 40.) There\nis no dispute that, as a result of these conditions, Pierce had several medical interviews, appointments,\nand interventions while he was in custody at CTF. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 87, 97, Def.’s Stmt. of\nFacts ¶ 40.)\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\f[******], and new medications. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 88.) Dr. Doh wrote back\n\nthat they could use written communication. (See id.) Pierce continued to write that he\n\nneeded an interpreter, but the doctor did not arrange for one to be provided. (See id.)\n\nInstead, Dr. Doh simply turned his computer screen toward Pierce to show him the\n\nquestions that were written there. (See id. ¶ 89.) Pierce wrote to Dr. Doh that he could\n\nnot understand the complicated vocabulary and medical jargon on the screen, but the\n\ndoctor wrote back that Pierce should not worry about it. (See id.) Dr. Doh continued to\n\npoint at words on the screen; to ask questions orally under the assumption that Pierce\n\ncould read lips; and to write notes to Pierce throughout the initial intake process. (See\n\nid. ¶ 90.)\n\n       Pierce asserts that, as a result of Unity’s failure to provide him with an ASL\n\ninterpreter at the initial intake, he was not able to communicate the fact that, prior to his\n\nincarceration, he had been taking five prescription medications and had a history of\n\n[******]. (See id. ¶¶ 91–93.) Without this information, Unity allegedly failed to give\n\nhim any [******] medication (see id. ¶ 94), and without that medication, Pierce\n\nallegedly experienced [******] in prison (see id. ¶ 96). Pierce concedes that he\n\nultimately received treatment for this problem; however, he claims that there was no\n\nASL interpreter to help him communicate with the doctors about his symptoms or\n\nchronic condition (see id. ¶ 97), nor was he provided with an interpreter to facilitate his\n\nconversation with the doctor who treated him for a different medical crisis he\n\nsubsequently experienced (see id. ¶¶ 100–01 (claiming that Pierce suffered from\n\n[******] while he was in protective custody and that no interpreter was provided)).\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       For its part, the District maintains that Pierce never requested an ASL interpreter\n\nfor his medical intake interview or any of his medical appointments, and this was likely\n\nso because, in the District’s view, no interpreter was necessary. (See Def.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶¶ 20, 27, 31, 35, 39.) According to the District, Dr. Doh was able to\n\ncommunicate effectively with Pierce in writing and specifically reported that Pierce\n\ncould read lips. (See id. ¶¶ 27–28.) The District admits that Dr. Doh showed Pierce the\n\nmedical intake questions on the computer screen rather than getting an interpreter to\n\ntranslate Dr. Doh’s spoken questions, but the District argues that the fact that Pierce\n\nanswered the questions through gestures and writing shows that Pierce must have\n\nunderstood the questions that he read off the screen. (See id. ¶ 30.)\n\n       The District also contends that, even if Pierce did have trouble communicating\n\nwith Dr. Doh, Pierce did not suffer any adverse consequences as a result of those\n\nalleged miscommunications. For example, the District points out that the medical\n\nprofessionals at Unity were aware of Pierce’s pre-existing conditions because Pierce\n\nsigned a written release allowing Unity to obtain Pierce’s medical history from former\n\nhealth care providers. (See id. ¶¶ 32–33.) Moreover, although Pierce was not\n\nprescribed preventative medication for [******], Pierce did receive prescription\n\n[******] medication after he [******]. (See id. ¶ 42.) Similarly, the District notes that\n\nalthough Pierce claims he was not able to communicate with his doctors about the\n\n[******], the doctor was able to develop a diagnosis ([******]) and prescribed the\n\nappropriate treatment ([******]). (See id. ¶ 44.)\n\n              2.     Pierce’s Access To Rehabilitative Classes\n\n       Pierce was enrolled in two inmate programs while at CTF: a class intended to\n\nhelp him with anger management and substance abuse issues, and a class about graphic\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdesign. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 49; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 55, 74.) The anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse course consisted of lectures, videos, and group discussion\n\nduring six or seven class sessions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 65; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶ 56.) The graphic arts class involved each inmates’ completion of computer-based\n\nmodules containing written instructions, written tests, and hands-on projects—\n\nassignments that were undertaken by the inmates individually and at their own pace,\n\nwhile a CTF employee monitored their progress and made himself or herself available\n\nto answer questions and to provide assistance. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 66; Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts ¶¶ 77–78.)\n\n       The parties disagree about the extent to which Pierce was able to understand, and\n\nbenefit from, these classes. According to Pierce, in the absence of an interpreter, he\n\nhad great difficulty following the courses; so much so that, during the first anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse group session that Pierce attended, he allegedly became\n\nincreasingly agitated and, at one point, even walked out of the session. (Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 64.) Pierce claims that, after this first session, he wrote to the instructor that he\n\nwas frustrated because he could not understand the lecture without an interpreter. (See\n\nid.) And, according to Pierce, this was one of many requests for an interpreter that he\n\nmade related to his classes; Pierce says that his partner also asked prison officials about\n\nsecuring an interpreter for Pierce for this purpose. (See id. ¶¶ 63, 68.) Pierce also\n\nmakes allegations regarding prison officials’ responses to these requests—for example,\n\nhe claims that, in response to the entreaties his partner made on his behalf, Assistant\n\nWarden Fulton eventually contacted Gallaudet University—a university for the deaf\n\nlocated in Washington, D.C.—to see if Gallaudet could provide an ASL interpreter for\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fPierce. (See id. ¶ 71.) 5 According to Pierce, when Fulton learned that Gallaudet\n\ninterpreters would need to be paid for their services, prison officials demurred, and\n\nstarted looking for other potential ways of accommodating Pierce. (See id. ¶¶ 71–72.)\n\n        Pierce asserts that, ultimately, the District neither sought, nor found, any outside\n\nASL interpreter for Pierce’s classes. (See id. ¶ 73.) Instead, near the end of his term of\n\nincarceration and after some of the sessions had been completed, a chaplain at CTF\n\nvolunteered to provide interpretive services for Pierce’s last few anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse classes. (See id. ¶ 75.) With respect to the graphics arts\n\ncourse, another inmate (Justin Clary) allegedly was asked to volunteer to sign for Pierce\n\nin approximately two or three classes (see id. ¶ 79); however, according to Pierce, Clary\n\nwas not a qualified interpreter—he just happened to be severely hard of hearing and\n\nalso happened to be enrolled in the class (see id. ¶¶ 79, 81)—and thus, Clary was not\n\nable to interpret effectively and accurately the written or oral statements that were\n\nbeing made in the class (see id. ¶ 80). 6\n\n        The District contests these representations, and maintains that Pierce\n\nsuccessfully participated in both the anger management/substance abuse program and\n\nthe graphic arts course. (See Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 68, 80.) With respect to the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse program, the District maintains that Pierce was provided\n\nwith an interpreter for all of the program sessions that took place after he requested\n\none. (See id. ¶ 57.) First, the District says, Assistant Warden Fulton employed Clary to\n\n\n5\n  The first names of CCA employees have been omitted from this Memorandum Opinion for security\nand confidentiality purposes. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts at 6 n.1.)\n6\n Pierce describes the alleged problem with Clary’s skills as an interpreter in this way: “I had to keep\nasking for clarification because I couldn’t understand what he was saying. It was not a complete\nsentence. It was just words here and there scattered about. It wasn’t anything complete. It wasn’t a\ncomplete thought. I could not understand him clearly.” (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 80.)\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fattend program sessions with Pierce and to interpret for him. (See id. ¶¶ 59–60.) Then,\n\nafter Pierce informed his counselor that Clary was not an adequate interpreter (see id.\n\n¶ 61), the District says that Assistant Warden Fulton contacted Gallaudet University and\n\nthe ADA Coordinator for DOC in an effort to find an interpreter for Pierce, but\n\nultimately did not have to hire an interpreter because the chaplain volunteered, and\n\ninterpreted for Pierce in four classes. (See id. ¶¶ 63–65.) The District also asserts that\n\nPierce received three days of good time credit for his participation in the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse program, and that he ultimately experienced positive\n\nbehavioral changes, including less drinking and an increased ability to control his\n\nanger. (See id. ¶¶ 68–70.)\n\n       With respect to the graphic arts vocational programming, the District insists that\n\nPierce did not request an interpreter for the program, and that an interpreter was not\n\nnecessary for him to participate in that particular program. (See id. ¶¶ 83–84.) In fact,\n\naccording to the District, Pierce’s instructor reported that he was a quick learner and\n\nhad performed better than some of the non-hearing impaired students enrolled in the\n\ncourse. (See id. ¶ 82.) The District also emphasizes that Pierce completed six modules\n\nof the graphic arts course and received six days of good time credit for his efforts. (See\n\nid. ¶¶ 80–81.)\n\n              3.     The Circumstances Surrounding Pierce’s Time In Protective\n                     Custody\n\n       Pierce spent approximately 25% of the total time he was in the custody of the\n\nDOC in solitary confinement conditions based on his alleged request for “protective\n\ncustody” after he was assaulted by another inmate. The parties have a stark\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fdisagreement about the circumstances surrounding Pierce’s entrance into protective\n\ncustody, and also how he was eventually released from that status.\n\n       Pierce maintains that, on February 23, 2012, he was shoved to the floor by\n\nanother inmate and that he reached out to Tutwiler, his assigned case manager, to\n\ncomplain about the incident. Tutwiler allegedly wrote a note to Pierce, asking him if he\n\nwould like to be placed in protective custody. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 102.) Pierce\n\ncontends that he did not understand what protective custody meant or entailed; he wrote\n\nback “If necessary.” (See id. ¶¶ 102, 104.) Pierce was then taken to Medical 82, where\n\na unit manager named Points came to Pierce’s new cell and allegedly wrote to Pierce\n\nthat Pierce needed to handwrite out “I fear for my safety” on a form Points was\n\nproviding. (See id. ¶ 105.) Pierce was confused by the request and initially refused,\n\nbut allegedly at Points’s insistence, Pierce copied that statement onto the form. (See\n\nid.)\n\n       Pierce was then placed in protective custody for fourteen days. (See id. ¶¶ 105,\n\n112.) Pierce claims that, because there was no ASL interpreter to facilitate his\n\nconversations with Tutwiler and Points, Pierce did not understand that protective\n\ncustody meant 23 hours per day of solitary confinement; that it would last for at least\n\nseven days; that it was voluntary; or that there were procedures by which he could\n\npromptly end protective custody status. (See id. ¶¶ 103–04.) According to Pierce, four\n\ndays after he was placed into protective custody, Pierce allegedly notified Allen, the\n\nFacilities Grievance Coordinator, that he had not understood what protective custody\n\nmeant. (See id. ¶ 107.) Pierce also allegedly stated his belief that his case manager\n\nshould have discussed the meaning of protective custody with him. (See id.) Allen\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fallegedly responded in writing: “You should have read it before you signed it.” (See\n\nid.) Pierce allegedly replied in writing, “I had no choice because they told me to sign.”\n\n(See id.)\n\n       At some point, Pierce told Griffin, another case manager, that he wanted to leave\n\nprotective custody and return to the general population. (See id. ¶ 108.) Griffin passed\n\nPierce’s request on to other staff, and on March 1, 2012, Assistant Warden Fulton\n\nlearned that Pierce wanted to leave protective custody. (See id. ¶¶ 108, 109.) Fulton\n\nwas also allegedly told that Pierce had asked to have a lawyer present before signing\n\nthe waiver form that was necessary for release back into the general population, and\n\nalthough Fulton apparently thought this was unusual, he purportedly did not ask why\n\nPierce would not sign the form despite wanting to leave protective custody. (See id.\n\n¶ 109.) Instead, Pierce alleges that Fulton advised the staff to keep Pierce in protective\n\ncustody and to review his status in one week. (See id.) Thereafter, according to Pierce,\n\nCTF employees moved Pierce to a different segregation cell, this time in the Special\n\nManagement Unit (“SMU”). (See id. ¶¶ 110–111.) Pierce felt that SMU was much\n\nworse than Medical 82; in SMU, Pierce was still on 23-hour lockdown, but he did not\n\nhave a roommate and could only see out of his cell through a small window in the metal\n\ndoor. (See id. ¶ 111.) Pierce was not released from SMU until March 7, 2012. (See id.\n\n¶ 112.)\n\n       The District has an entirely different view of the circumstances preceding\n\nPierce’s confinement in protective custody. First of all, according to the District,\n\nPoints fully explained to Pierce in writing what “protective custody” meant. (See\n\nDef.’s Cont. Facts ¶ 104.) The District claims that Points also told Pierce that, if Pierce\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fwanted to be placed in protective custody, Pierce would need to write on the protective\n\ncustody request form why Pierce wanted to be placed in protective custody. (See id.\n\n¶ 105.) Pierce then allegedly voluntarily wrote out on the form, “I fear for my safety.\n\nHIV +” and signed it. (See id.) Thus, the District maintains that Points did not require\n\nPierce to write on the form at all, much less to make any specific statement. (See id.)\n\n      The District also claims that, once Pierce filled out the protective custody\n\nrequest form, Assistant Warden Fulton was prohibited from removing Pierce from\n\nprotective custody status until Pierce signed a protective custody waiver indicating that\n\nPierce no longer feared for his safety. (See id. ¶ 109.) According to the District, Pierce\n\nknew that he needed to sign the waiver if he wanted to be removed from protective\n\ncustody, but Pierce refused to sign the waiver form anyway. (See id.) Moreover, the\n\nDistrict claims that, per CTF policy, inmates in protective custody are subject to review\n\nevery seven days and thus Fulton’s direction to the staff to review Pierce’s status in\n\nseven days was in accordance with facility policy. (See id.) The District also contends\n\nthat Pierce was confined under the same conditions in both Medical 82 and the Special\n\nManagement Unit. (See id. ¶ 111.)\n\n             4.     Deaf Inmates’ Rights To Telecommunications, Official\n                    Notifications, And Visitation\n\n      Finally, and not surprisingly, the parties tell completely different stories\n\nregarding certain privileges that inmates ordinarily receive at CTF and the extent to\n\nwhich deaf inmates such as Pierce are afforded equal access to them.\n\n      For example, according to Pierce, hearing inmates in the general population in\n\nthe prison’s medical unit have access to telephones seven days a week, are permitted to\n\nuse the telephone for 10 minutes at a time, and do not need to request permission in\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fadvance to use the telephones. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 114.) Pierce, on the other\n\nhand, allegedly had much more limited access to telecommunications, even apart from\n\nthe fact that CTF provides deaf inmates with an outmoded TTY device instead of a\n\nmodern videophone. 7 Pierce claims that his access to the TTY device varied depending\n\non where he was housed because, in order for him to place a call, DOC officials\n\nrequired him to make an appointment in advance to use the TTY, which was available\n\nonly in his case manager’s office. (See id. ¶¶ 115, 124.) Moreover, according to\n\nPierce, prison officials demanded the presence of his case manager or another CTF\n\nemployee while he was using the TTY device. (See id. ¶ 124.) Pierce alleges that his\n\ncase manager’s hours were typically only Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to\n\n5:00 p.m., which substantially restricted his TTY usage window, and even when his\n\ncase manager was on duty, she allegedly would only grant Pierce’s requests to use the\n\nTTY machine at her convenience. (See id. ¶¶ 124–25.) Pierce also alleges that his calls\n\nwere strictly limited to 10 minutes, even though communicating using a TTY device\n\ntakes substantially more time than communicating using a telephone. (See id. ¶ 126.) 8\n\n\n7\n  A TTY consists of a keyboard, display screen, and telephone. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 116.) Typed\nmessages from each party are sent over the telephone lines and appear on the screen of the other (see\nid. ¶ 116), and thus both parties must have a TTY to have a direct conversation (see id. ¶ 118). Indirect\nconversations are also possible, if the telephone company provides relay services, which involve\ncommunicating through the assistance of a third-party telephone operator, who reads aloud words typed\nby the deaf party and types out the spoken responses of the hearing person. (See id. ¶ 117) Two deaf\nindividuals cannot communicate via TTY unless both parties have a TTY device and can type in\nEnglish effectively. (See id. ¶ 118).\n Pierce avers that, like many other deaf individuals, he uses a videophone in the outside world. (See id.\n¶ 8.) A videophone uses high-speed internet to enable real-time video communication so that deaf\nindividuals can communicate with one another in ASL. (See id. ¶ 57). Videophones also enable\ncommunication between deaf and hearing individuals through the use of a video relay service (“VRS”).\nVRS is a system by which a deaf individual signs via video monitor to a remote sign language\ninterpreter, and the interpreter communicates the deaf person’s message to the hearing individual in\nspoken English and vice versa. (See id. ¶ 58.) VRS is free to all users and has been widely available\nsince at least the mid-2000s. (See id. ¶ 59.)\n8\n In this same vein, Pierce contends that hearing inmates who were in protective custody in the Medical\n82 unit and the SMU could ask to have a telephone brought to their cell during the day by asking the\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f        In response to Pierce’s accusations regarding his unequal access to\n\ntelecommunications, the District maintains that Pierce was provided access to the TTY\n\ndevice when he requested it (see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 110), and that he did not\n\nrequest use of a videophone while at CTF (id. ¶ 22). Furthermore, the District contends\n\nthat the TTY device must be kept in the case manager’s office “for security reasons”\n\n(id. ¶ 112), and that the practical differences between using a TTY device and using a\n\ntelephone justify the different access policies that apply to hearing and hearing-disabled\n\ninmates. (See, e.g., id. ¶ 115 (“The TTY device cannot be left unsecured in the housing\n\nunit, where it could pose a security risk or become contraband.”); id. ¶ 116 (“CTF staff\n\nmust be present during TTY calls, which are not subject to security monitoring and\n\nrecording like the regular inmate telephones.”).)\n\n        Pierce alleges that inequities also exist with respect to both the visitation\n\nprocesses that are afforded to deaf inmates at CTF and the official notification\n\nannouncements that CTF staff make. Regarding visitation, Pierce claims that he was\n\nhandcuffed during at least one visit from his partner and his mother (see Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 137), which is problematic because Pierce communicates with his mother using\n\nASL and needs to have his hands free in order to speak. The District responds that\n\nPierce did not request any accommodations with respect to visitation while he was at\n\nCTF (see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 150), and that it is standard CTF policy that all\n\ninmates in protective custody be restrained when they are outside their cells. (See id.\n\n\n\nofficer on the unit. (See id. ¶ 127.) By contrast, deaf and hard of hearing inmates had to request to use\na TTY in the case manager’s office, which allegedly involved writing a request to use a TTY in the\noffice and giving it to an officer during that officer’s daily walkthrough. (See id. ¶¶ 128, 131.) If the\nrequest was granted, the inmate would be brought to the office in handcuffs and would be permitted to\nuse the TTY device, still in handcuffs. (See id.)\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\f¶ 139.) 9 Thus, the District claims that it was merely following policy when Pierce was\n\nrestrained during a visit with his mother and Holder. (See id. ¶ 148.) The District also\n\npoints out (and Pierce concedes) that an exception was made in Pierce’s case, and that\n\nhis handcuffs were removed once Pierce’s mother explained the problem to CTF\n\nauthorities.\n\n        Pierce’s alleged concern about official notifications remained unresolved,\n\nhowever. Pierce asserts that, because there was no visual alarm to alert him to\n\nannouncements or to notify him of an emergency lockdown, fire, or other emergency\n\nwhen his cell door was closed, he was constantly anxious and worried about missing\n\nimportant information. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 134–135.) The District contends\n\nthat Pierce’s anxiety was unfounded, because each housing unit at CTF has alarms in\n\nthe hallways consisting of a very loud alarm and strobe lights that are visible from\n\ninside each of the cells, including the cells that Pierce occupied during his incarceration\n\nat CTF. (Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 123–24.) Furthermore, with respect to Pierce’s claim\n\nthat he was not provided access to a visual alarm for other notifications, the District\n\nclaims that CTF does not use a loud speaker or other type of auditory system for\n\nmaking notifications or announcements to inmates (see id. ¶ 129), and that, instead,\n\nwritten notifications and announcements are posted on the bulletin boards in the\n\nhousing units, which are accessible to all inmates when they are out of their cells. (See\n\nid. ¶ 127.)\n\n\n\n\n9\n  According to Defendants, this policy applies to all “status inmates,” a category that includes inmates\nin protective custody, administrative segregation, and disciplinary segregation. (See Def.’s Stmt. of\nFacts ¶ 140.)\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\f       C.     Procedural History\n\n       On February 1, 2013—exactly one year after Pierce was first committed to the\n\ncustody of the DOC—Pierce filed the instant three-count complaint against the District.\n\n(See Compl., ECF No. 1.) Claims I and II of Pierce’s complaint allege that the District\n\n“intentionally” discriminated against Pierce in violation of Title II of the ADA and\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act “by failing to provide Mr. Pierce adequate access\n\nto a qualified ASL interpreter, telecommunications devices, visual alarms[,] and\n\nvisitation.” (Id. ¶ 49 (Claim I, Title II of the ADA); id. ¶ 50 (Claim II, Section 504 of\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act).) In Claim III, Pierce alleges that the District also violated the\n\nADA and the Rehabilitation Act by “retailat[ing] against [him] for asserting his rights”\n\nunder those statutes. (See id. ¶ 51.) After the parties engaged in discovery and\n\nattempted to resolve the case through mediation (see Order Referring Case for\n\nMediation, ECF No. 40), Pierce filed a motion for summary judgment as to Claims I\n\nand II of his complaint (see Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. as to Claims I and II of the\n\nCompl., ECF No. 47).\n\n       Pierce argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on Claims I and II because\n\nthe District violated Title II and Section 504 by (1) failing to provide Pierce with a\n\nqualified ASL interpreter for his rehabilitation classes, medical treatment, and the\n\ngrievance process (see Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot (“Pl.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 48-2 at\n\n18–32); (2) providing a TTY machine to Pierce to make phone calls rather than a\n\nvideophone and limiting the times at which and duration for which Pierce could make\n\nphone calls (see id. at 32–35); (3) not providing a visual or tactile alarm to Pierce for\n\nboth routine and emergency notifications (see id. at 35–36); and (4) handcuffing Pierce\n\nduring a visit with his mother and partner (see id. at 36). Pierce asserts that he did not\n\n\n                                            20\n\fmove for summary judgment with respect to Claim III of his complaint because there is\n\na material factual dispute regarding whether he was placed in protective custody\n\nbecause he requested accommodations for his disability. (See Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to\n\nDef.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 59-1, at 45–48.)\n\n       The District has not only opposed Pierce’s motion for summary judgment (see\n\nDef.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. (“Def.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 60), it has also filed one of its\n\nown (see Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 49). The District contends\n\nthat it is entitled to summary judgment on Claims I and II because, in the District’s\n\nview, the only accommodations that Pierce requested during his time at CTF were an\n\ninterpreter for his anger management/substance abuse class, the use of a TTY device,\n\nand to be un-cuffed during his visit with his mother and partner—accommodations that\n\nthe District says it readily provided. (See Def.’s Mot. at 7–16.) To the extent that\n\nPierce argues that the District should have accommodated him by providing an ASL\n\ninterpreter at other times, the District contends that it cannot be held liable for its\n\nfailure to provide accommodations that were not requested. (See id. at 5, 6, 16, 21.)\n\nThe District also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Pierce’s retaliation\n\nclaim (Claim III) because, in the District’s view, the prison staff did not take any\n\nadverse action against Pierce as a result of his requests for accommodation. (See id. at\n\n17–18.)\n\n       This Court held a hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment\n\non April 23, 2015. (See Minute Entry for Proceedings dated Apr. 23, 2015.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fII.    LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A.     Motions for Summary Judgment Under Rule 56\n\n       The parties’ cross motions for summary judgment compel this Court to undertake\n\n“the threshold inquiry of determining whether there is a need for trial—whether, in\n\nother words, there are any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a\n\nfinder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.”\n\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986); see also Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the “initial responsibility of\n\ninforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of\n\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue\n\nof material fact.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Moreover, such “evidence is to be viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party and the court must draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the nonmoving party.” Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nThis is because “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the\n\ndrawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a\n\njudge[.]” Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255; see also Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 330\n\nn.2 (“If . . . there is any evidence in the record from any source from which a\n\nreasonable inference in the [nonmoving party’s] favor may be drawn, the moving party\n\nsimply cannot obtain a summary judgment[.]” (internal quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n       That being said, the mere existence of a factual dispute, by itself, is not\n\nsufficient to bar summary judgment. See Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. at 255. The\n\n\n                                            22\n\fcontested fact must be material and the dispute must be genuine. A fact is only material\n\nif it could establish an element of a claim or defense and, therefore, “might affect the\n\noutcome of the suit under the governing law[.]” See id. at 248; see also Celotex, 477\n\nU.S. at 322–23 (noting that where a nonmoving party “fails to make a showing\n\nsufficient to establish an element essential to that party’s case . . . there can be no\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact, since a complete failure of proof concerning an\n\nessential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts\n\nimmaterial” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). Likewise, a dispute is\n\nonly genuine if “the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission\n\nto a jury.” Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 251–52; see also id. at 249 (“If the evidence is\n\nmerely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.”\n\n(citations omitted).)\n\n       Where—as here—the parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, “each\n\nmust carry its own burden under the applicable legal standard.” Ehrman v. United\n\nStates, 429 F. Supp. 2d 61, 67 (D.D.C. 2006). Accordingly, “[c]ross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment are treated separately[,]” Act Now to Stop War & End Racism Coal.\n\nv.

Dep’t of Justice, 469 F.3d 126, 129 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2006). Indeed, “‘neither party waives the right to a full trial on the merits by filing\n\nits own motion; each side concedes that no material facts are at issue only for the\n\npurposes of its own motion.’” See Sherwood v. Washington Post, 871 F.2d 1144, 1147\n\nn.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 n.3 (D.C.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act & Title II of the ADA\n\n       Pierce has filed the instant lawsuit under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\nand Title II of the ADA. Congress enacted Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act\n\n(“Section 504”) and its companion legislation Title II of the ADA (“Title II”) in 1973\n\nand 1990, respectively, in order to address the “lengthy and tragic history of\n\nsegregation and discrimination” that people with disabilities have faced in the United\n\nStates.

Section 504\n\nand Title II resulted from years of public protests, marches, acts of civil disobedience,\n\nand court filings in the 1960s and 1970s—activities that were part of a movement aimed\n\nat securing for disabled people the same rights and privileges afforded to able-bodied\n\npeople. See Robert L. Burgdorf Jr., The Americans with Disabilities Act: Analysis and\n\nImplications of A Second-Generation Civil Rights Statute, 26 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L. Rev.\n\n413, 426 (1991). Participants in this civil rights movement insisted that society\n\nrecognize disabled people not as “unfortunate, afflicted creatures” but as “equal\n\ncitizens, individually varying across the spectrum of human abilities, whose over-riding\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fneeds are freedom from discrimination and a fair chance to participate fully in society.”\n\nId. at 426–27.\n\n        With respect to the programs, services, and activities that are provided by, or\n\nfunded through, government entities, Congress responded by enacting legislation “to\n\nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of\n\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities” as well as “strong, consistent,\n\nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)–(2) (2012); see also 29 U.S.C. § 701(a)(5) (2012)\n\n(acknowledging that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms\n\nof discrimination in . . . critical areas” of life). To this end, Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act specifically states that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a\n\ndisability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\n\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). Similarly, Title II of the ADA provides that “no qualified\n\nindividual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from\n\nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a\n\npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.” 42 U.S.C. §\n\n12132. 10\n\n\n10\n   Notably, the D.C. Circuit has long held that the “[c]laims and defenses under [Section 504 and Title\nII] are virtually identical,” Harrison v. Rubin, 174 F.3d 249, 253, (D.C. Cir. 1999), and that “cases\ninterpreting either [statute] are applicable and interchangeable[,]” Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson,\n525 F.3d 1256, 1260 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2008). There are only two material differences between the two\nprovisions. First, the Rehabilitation Act only applies to federal agencies and departments, federal\nprograms, and recipients of federal funding, whereas the ADA applies to all entities that provide\nservices to the public. See Paul V. Sullivan, Note, The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990: An\nAnalysis of Title III and Applicable Case Law, 29 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 1117, 1120 (1995). Second, the\nstatutes have different causation requirements. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that “[n]o\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f        Significantly for present purposes, because Congress was concerned that\n\n“[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was . . . most often the product, not of\n\ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference—of benign neglect[,]”\n\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985), the express prohibitions against\n\ndisability-based discrimination in Section 504 and Title II include an affirmative\n\nobligation to make benefits, services, and programs accessible to disabled people. That\n\nis, an entity that provides services to the public cannot stand idly by while people with\n\ndisabilities attempt to utilize programs and services designed for the able-bodied;\n\ninstead, to satisfy Section 504 and Title II, such entities may very well need to act\n\naffirmatively to modify, supplement, or tailor their programs and services to make them\n\naccessible to persons with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) (requiring entities that\n\nprovide services to the public to (1) make “reasonable modifications to rules, policies,\n\nor practices”; (2) “remov[e] . . . architectural, communication, or transportation\n\nbarriers”; and (3) “provi[de] auxiliary aids and services” so as to enable disabled\n\npersons to participate in programs or activities). Moreover, these modifications—called\n\n“accommodations” in Section 504 and Title II parlance—must be sufficient to provide a\n\ndisabled person with an “equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\n\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement” as a person who is not disabled.\n\nAlexander, 469 U.S. at 305 (quoting regulations implementing Section 504 (internal\n\n\n\n\notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or\nhis disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .” 29 U.S.C. §\n794(a) (emphasis added). By contrast, under Title II of the ADA, “discrimination need not be the sole\nreason” for the exclusion of or denial of benefits to the plaintiff. Soledad v. U.S. Dep’t of Treasury,\n304 F.3d 500, 503–04 (5th Cir. 2002); see also Alston v. District of Columbia, 770 F. Supp. 2d 289, 298\n(D.D.C. 2011). Neither of these differences are relevant to the claims in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                     26\n\fquotation marks omitted)); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii) (2014) (stating that a\n\npublic entity discriminates in violation of Title II if qualified individuals with\n\ndisabilities are given an “opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit,\n\nor service that is not equal to that afforded others”).\n\n\nIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n       As explained fully below, this Court will grant Pierce’s motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to his Section 504 and Title II discrimination claims (Claims I\n\nand II of his complaint) and will deny the District’s motion for summary judgment in its\n\nentirety. The Court reaches this conclusion because it finds that the District violated\n\nSection 504 and Title II as a matter of law when it failed to evaluate Pierce’s need for\n\naccommodation at the time he was taken into custody. (This legal conclusion is entirely\n\nindependent of the hotly disputed issues regarding whether or not Pierce was, in fact,\n\nable to communicate effectively with prison officials, and whether or not Pierce did, in\n\nfact, request an ASL interpreter for his interactions while in custody; however, as\n\ndiscussed below, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could agree with the District\n\non these issues, and thus, the District violated Section 504 and Title II on this basis as\n\nwell.) The Court also finds that, because the District’s failure to evaluate Pierce’s\n\nneeds amounted to deliberate indifference to Pierce’s rights and the District’s\n\nobligations under Section 504 and Title II, the District’s conduct constituted intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and thus, Pierce is entitled to compensatory damages for the mental,\n\nemotional, and physical injuries he sustained. However, with respect to Pierce’s\n\nretaliation claim, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact that\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fstill need to be resolved; consequently, the District’s motion for summary judgment on\n\nthe retaliation claim must be denied.\n\n        A.      The District Intentionally And Unlawfully Discriminated Against\n                Pierce When It Eschewed Its Duty To Assess His Need For\n                Accommodation And Denied Him Meaningful Access To Prison\n                Programs And Services\n\n        To establish disability-based discrimination under Section 504 and Title II, a\n\nplaintiff must prove (1) that he is a qualified individual with a disability; (2) that he is\n\nbeing excluded from participation in, or is being denied benefits, services, programs, or\n\nother activities for which a public entity is responsible, or is otherwise being\n\ndiscriminated against by the public entity; and (3) that such exclusion, denial of\n\nbenefits, or discrimination is by reason of his disability. See Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt.\n\nSys. Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999); Alston v. District of Columbia, 561 F. Supp. 2d\n\n29, 37 (D.D.C. 2008). Only the second element is at issue here, because the District\n\ndoes not deny that Pierce is a qualified individual with a disability, or that the DOC is a\n\npublic entity. (See Def.’s Opp’n at 5); see also Pa. Dep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S.\n\n206, 210 (1998) (holding that a disabled inmate can state a claim under Title II if, by\n\nreason of his disability, he is denied participation in an activity provided in state\n\nprison). 11\n\n\n11\n   Under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, an individual has a disability if\nhe or she “[has] a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life\nactivities of such individual.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1)(A) (2012); see also 29 U.S.C. § 705(20) (2012).\nHearing is a “major life activity,” and deafness is clearly established as a disability. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 12102(2)(A) (hearing is a “major life activity” pursuant to the ADA); 29 U.S.C. § 705(20)(B)\n(definition of “individual with a disability” pursuant to the Rehabilitation Act includes those who have\na disability pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12102); see also Ball v. AMC Entm’t, Inc., 246 F. Supp. 2d 17, 20\n(D.D.C. 2003) (deafness is a disability recognized by the ADA). Furthermore, the ADA defines a\npublic entity as “any State or local government” or “any department, agency, special purpose district,\nor other instrumentality of the State or States or local government[,]” 42 U.S.C. § 12131(1), and\nprisoners “have the same interest in access to the programs, services, and activities available to the\nother inmates of their prison as disabled people on the outside have to the counterpart programs,\nservices, and activities available to free people[,]” Crawford v. Indiana Dep’t of Corr., 115 F.3d 481,\n\n\n                                                   28\n\f       With respect to the question of whether or not Pierce was excluded from\n\nparticipation in, or denied the benefits of, prison services by reason of his disability in\n\nviolation of Section 504 and Title II, both parties maintain that they are entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on the record here, and as discussed above, they have highlighted as\n\n“material” certain facts that are primarily related to Pierce’s alleged need for an ASL\n\ninterpreter and other accommodations, and the circumstances under which Pierce may\n\nor may not have requested those accommodations. (See, e.g., Pl.’s Mot. at 26 (“Without\n\na qualified interpreter in any of his graphics arts classes, and without an interpreter in\n\nall but his last three or four anger management/substance abuse classes, Mr. Pierce was\n\nclearly denied meaningful access to these programs and was unable to derive any of the\n\nbenefits from them.”); Def.’s Opp’n at 11 (“Pierce did not request an interpreter for his\n\nmedical intake and appointments, [and] his providers were able to communicate with\n\nhim in writing.”).) However, there is an undisputed threshold fact that, in this Court’s\n\nview, so clearly establishes intentional discrimination in violation of Section 504 and\n\nTitle II that summary judgment must be issued in Pierce’s favor notwithstanding the\n\nfactual disputes over Pierce’s actual requests and needs: the District took Pierce—an\n\nobviously disabled inmate—into custody without undertaking any ex ante evaluation of\n\nhis accommodation requirements, and when he later requested aid, either rebuffed his\n\ninquiries entirely or provided him with whatever auxiliary tools it had on hand. As\n\nexplained below, this Court holds that the failure of prison staff to conduct an informed\n\nassessment of the abilities and accommodation needs of a new inmate who is obviously\n\n\n\n\n486 (7th Cir. 1997) abrogated on other grounds by Erickson v. Bd. of Governors of State Colleges &\nUniversities for Ne. Illinois Univ., 207 F.3d 945 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n                                                 29\n\fdisabled is intentional discrimination in the form of deliberate indifference and violates\n\nSection 504 and Title II as a matter of law. Moreover, the Court concludes that even if\n\nthe District is correct to contend that the Section 504 and Title II duty to provide\n\naccommodations for disabled inmates is triggered only if the inmate requests and\n\nultimately needs accommodation, no reasonable jury could find that Pierce failed to\n\nrequest an ASL interpreter, or that he could communicate effectively without one, on\n\nthe record presented here.\n\n              1.     The District Had An Affirmative Duty To Evaluate Pierce’s\n                     Accommodation Requirements, And Its Failure To Do So\n                     Constituted Disability Discrimination As A Matter Of Law\n\n       It is clear beyond cavil that the core principle that underlies the protections of\n\nSection 504 and Title II is equal access. As explained above, Congress has required\n\nentities to provide reasonable accommodations that would permit disabled individuals\n\nto access programs and services in addition to prohibiting discriminatory animus, see\n\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985), and the regulatory scheme that\n\nundergirds the anti-discrimination statutes reinforces this reasonable accommodations\n\nmandate. Thus, without regard to whether persons with disabilities who seek the\n\nbenefit of public services have requested accommodation, a public entity that is covered\n\nby Title II must “operate each service, program, or activity so that the service, program,\n\nor activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by, people\n\nwith disabilities[,]” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 (2014), and to satisfy Section 504, recipients of\n\nfederal funding “shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids to qualified handicapped\n\npersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills where a refusal to make such\n\nprovision would discriminatorily impair or exclude the participation of such persons in\n\na program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance[,]” 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(f).\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       Given Congress’s unmistakable intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, [and]\n\nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities” in\n\nvarious aspects of life, 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2), and also its recognition that “benign\n\nneglect” is a particularly pernicious form of disability discrimination, Alexander, 469\n\nU.S. at 295, the District’s insistence here that prison officials have no legal obligation\n\nto provide accommodations for disabled inmates unless the inmate specifically requests\n\nsuch aid—and even then, only if it actually turns out that the inmate really needs the\n\nrequested accommodation—is untenable and cannot be countenanced. First of all,\n\nnothing in the disability discrimination statutes even remotely suggests that covered\n\nentities have the option of being passive in their approach to disabled individuals as far\n\nas the provision of accommodations is concerned. Quite to the contrary, as explained\n\nabove, Section 504 and Title II mandate that entities act affirmatively to evaluate the\n\nprograms and services they offer and to ensure that people with disabilities will have\n\nmeaningful access to those services. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.150(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.150. This affirmative duty is seemingly at its apex in the\n\ncontext of a prison facility, in light of the uneven power dynamic between prison\n\nofficials and inmates that inherently and appropriately exists, and also the fact that\n\ndepartments of corrections have complete control over whether prison inmates (disabled\n\nor not) receive any programs or services at all. Cf. Brown v. Plata, 131 S. Ct. 1910,\n\n1928 (2011) (explaining that, “to incarcerate, society takes from prisoners the means to\n\nprovide for their own needs” and thus prisons must provide for prisoners); Estelle v.\n\nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976) (referring to “the common-law view that ‘it is but just\n\nthat the public be required to care for the prisoner, who cannot by reason of the\n\n\n\n\n                                            31\n\fdeprivation of his liberty, care for himself’”) (quoting Spicer v. Williamson, 132 S.E.\n\n291, 293 (N.C. 1926)). Put another way, given that Section 504 and Title II require all\n\nentities that provide public services to act affirmatively to ensure that disabled\n\nindividuals have meaningful access, prisons seemingly have even more responsibility in\n\nthis regard, because inmates necessarily rely totally upon corrections departments for\n\nall of their needs while in custody and do not have the freedom to obtain such services\n\n(or the accommodations that permit them to access those services) elsewhere.\n\n       What is more, the District’s suggestion that a prison facility need not act to\n\naccommodate an obviously disabled inmate if the inmate does not ask for\n\naccommodations (see Def.’s Mot. at 5) is truly baffling as a matter of law and logic.\n\nThe District does not explain how inmates with known communications-related\n\ndifficulties (such as Pierce) are supposed to communicate a need for accommodations,\n\nor, for that matter, why the protections of Section 504 and Title II should be construed\n\nto be unavailable to such disabled persons unless they somehow manage to overcome\n\ntheir communications-related disability sufficiently enough to convey their need for\n\naccommodations effectively. The implications of the District’s analysis are troubling,\n\nand they sweep broadly—by the District’s reasoning, it would appear that only a\n\nspecific request for a wheelchair would trigger any duty to accommodate an inmate who\n\ncannot walk, and a blind inmate would need to make a specific request for a cane or a\n\nguide if he desired to move about the prison grounds; meanwhile, prison officials could\n\nsit idly by, taking no affirmative steps to accommodate such disabled prisoners and\n\nexpecting to be able to wield the inmate’s failure to request accommodation like some\n\nsort of talisman that wards off Section 504 and Title II liability in any future legal\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\faction. This imagined state of affairs is unquestionably inconsistent with the text and\n\npurpose of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, which means that the District must now\n\nface a stark reality: no matter how fervently it holds the belief that a public entity’s\n\nduty to provide accommodations arises only by request, there is neither legal nor logical\n\nsupport for that proposition.\n\n       To be sure, there are times in which courts have held that a disabled person must\n\nrequest accommodation. See, e.g., Flemmings v. Howard Univ., 198 F.3d 857, 858,\n\n861–62 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding that an employer did not violate an employee’s rights\n\nunder Title I of the ADA by failing to accommodate employee’s vertigo-related\n\ndisabilities because employee failed to request an accommodation). But it is equally\n\nclear that the legal significance of the request requirement is merely to put the entity on\n\nnotice that the person is disabled; it does not serve as a means of shifting the burden of\n\ninitiating the accommodations process to the disabled individual. See Paulone v. City\n\nof Frederick, 787 F. Supp. 2d 360, 403–04 (D. Md. 2011) (explaining that the “‘request\n\nrequirement’ . . . is a function of the fact that ‘a person’s disability and concomitant\n\nneed for accommodation are not always known . . . until the [person] requests an\n\naccommodation’”) (quoting Kiman v. N.H. Dep’t of Corr., 451 F.3d 274, 283 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In other words, the request performs a\n\nsignaling function—i.e., it alerts the public entity to the disabled person’s need for an\n\naccommodation—and where, as here, the inmate’s disability is obvious and indisputably\n\nknown to the provider of services, no request is necessary. See Robertson v. Las\n\nAnimas Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t, 500 F.3d 1185, 1197–98 (10th Cir. 2007) (“[A] public\n\nentity is on notice that an individual needs an accommodation when it knows that an\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\findividual requires one, either because that need is obvious or because the individual\n\nrequests an accommodation.”); Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1139 (9th Cir.\n\n2001) (“When the plaintiff has alerted the public entity to his need for accommodation\n\n(or where the need for accommodation is obvious, or required by statute or regulation),\n\nthe public entity is on notice that an accommodation is required. . . .”).\n\n       The second overarching reason that the District’s legal position is untenable is\n\nthat, by reading the antidiscrimination statutes as mandating that public entities provide\n\nneeded accommodations but not as requiring those entities to take any affirmative steps\n\nto ascertain what accommodations might be needed, the District suggests that Section\n\n504 and Title II permit reliance on guesswork and happenstance with respect to the\n\nprovision of accommodations, when the law clearly requires otherwise. It is well-\n\nestablished (albeit in the employment context) that it violates the ADA if an employer\n\nwith a duty to provide reasonable accommodations responds to the known disabled\n\ncondition of an employee by giving that employee whatever aids the employer alone\n\nthinks might do the trick, without any actual assessment of the employee’s individual\n\ncondition or needs in consultation with the employee. See, e.g., Taylor v. Phoenixville\n\nSch. Dist., 184 F.3d 296, 315 (3d Cir. 1999) (reversing grant of summary judgment to\n\nemployer because notwithstanding fact that employee’s son “requested accommodations\n\n[for plaintiff], informed [the employer] about [employee’s] condition, and provided [the\n\nemployer] with the means to obtain more information if needed[,]” employer “offered\n\nno accommodations or assistance in finding them, made [employee’s] job more\n\ndifficult, and simply sat back and continued to document her failures”). To the\n\ncontrary, “[o]nce an employer is aware of its responsibility to provide a reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                            34\n\faccommodation . . . it must ‘identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability\n\nand potential reasonable accommodations,’ which is best done through an ‘informal,\n\ninteractive process’ that involves both the employer and the employee with a\n\ndisability.” McNair v. District of Columbia, 11 F. Supp. 3d 10, 16 (D.D.C. 2014)\n\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3)).\n\n       This apparently comes as no news to the District—the DOC’s own regulations\n\nmandate something of an interactive process with respect to accommodations insofar as\n\nthey specifically direct prison officials to give preference to the requests of disabled\n\ninmates regarding the auxiliary aids to be provided. (See D.C. Dep’t of Corr., Program\n\nStatement 3800.3, Ex. 9 to Rocap Decl., ECF No. 48-5, at 92, § 12(a)(2); see also id.\n\n§ 12(b)(2) (stating that the “DOC shall honor the [inmate’s] expressed choice”\n\nregarding accommodations unless, inter alia, “it can show that another equally effective\n\nmeans of communication is available”).) Nevertheless, the District here resists the\n\nconclusion that the law required CTF’s employees and contractors to take affirmative\n\nsteps up front to evaluate Pierce’s needs in order to identify which accommodations\n\nwould be appropriate for him. Instead, by insisting that the accommodations process\n\nthat was employed in the instant case is consistent with Section 504 and Title II, the\n\nDistrict suggests that the law permits corrections staff to treat the reasonable\n\naccommodations mandate much like a game of chance--i.e., on the one hand, prison\n\nstaff can play it safe by undertaking an ex ante assessment of the actual needs of a\n\ndisabled inmate in their custody, or on the other, they can opt to forgo that expense, and\n\nif accommodations are requested, provide a hodgepodge of whatever aids are in the\n\nprison’s possession, thereby betting either that the inmate will remain silent or that he\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fultimately will be found to have needed no more than the auxiliary aids that the\n\ncorrections facility randomly provided. There will, of course, be times when\n\ncorrections staff will take that bet and get it right. Cf. Charles Clay Doyle et al.,\n\nDictionary of Modern Proverbs 287 (2012) (noting that even a broken clock gets the\n\ntime right twice a day). But to the extent that the District contends that Section 504 and\n\nTitle II permit public entities to engage in this sort of gamble with respect to the\n\naccommodation needs of disabled individuals whom they are required to serve, it is\n\nsorely mistaken. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2)\n\n(indicating that a public entity has a duty to “determin[e] what types of auxiliary aids\n\nand services are necessary” for the disabled individuals it serves).\n\n        The bottom line is this: this Court squarely rejects the legal position that the\n\nDistrict seeks to advance in this action, which is, in essence, that the DOC acts\n\nconsistently with Section 504 and Title II when it takes custody of an obviously\n\ndisabled prisoner without undertaking any evaluation of that inmate’s needs and the\n\naccommodations that will be necessary to ensure that he or she has meaningful access\n\nto prison services, and instead, provides a random assortment of auxiliary aids upon\n\nrequest and at various times based primarily on considerations of its own convenience. 12\n\nQuite to the contrary, based on its reading of federal law, this Court holds that prison\n\nofficials have an affirmative duty to assess the potential accommodation needs of\n\ninmates with known disabilities who are taken into custody and to provide the\n\n\n\n12\n   With respect to hearing-disabled inmates in particular, it appears that the District of Columbia’s DOC\nis not the only prison system that engages in this sort of practice. See, e.g., Matt Zapotosky, Justice\nDept. Looking into Treatment of Deaf Inmates in Arlington Jail, Washington Post, July 29, 2015,\navailable at: http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/justice-dept-looking-into-treatment-of-deaf-\ninmates-in-arlington-jail/2015/07/29/ae910412-360a-11e5-b673-1df005a0fb28_story.html.\n\n\n\n                                                   36\n\faccommodations that are necessary for those inmates to access the prison’s programs\n\nand services, without regard to whether or not the disabled individual has made a\n\nspecific request for accommodation and without relying solely on the assumptions of\n\nprison officials regarding that individual’s needs. And because it is undisputed that the\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors did no such thing when Pierce arrived at CTF, this\n\nCourt finds that the District violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II\n\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act as a matter of law.\n\n              2.     Even If The District Is Only Legally Required To Provide Inmates\n                     With Accommodations That Are Both Requested And Ultimately\n                     Needed, There Is No Genuine Dispute That Pierce Requested The\n                     Assistance Of An ASL Interpreter Or That He Needed One\n\n       Having already determined that the District committed a violation of Section 504\n\nand Title II as a matter of law when it failed to evaluate Pierce’s accommodation needs\n\nat the time he was taken into custody, the Court pauses here (prior to turning to the\n\nmatter of damages) to address the myriad factual disputes that arise under the District’s\n\nview of its legal obligations. The District maintains that its legal obligation to\n\naccommodate Pierce depended on three things: (1) whether Pierce requested an\n\naccommodation, (2) whether the requested accommodation was necessary, and (3)\n\nwhether the requested accommodation could be provided. (See Hr’g Tr. at 52:18, 53:7–\n\n12; see also, e.g., Def.’s Mot. at 5 (“An entity cannot be held liable for failure to\n\nprovide accommodations that were not requested.”); Def.’s Opp’n at 1–2 (“Pierce’s\n\nMotion focuses largely on what accommodations may be possible for a hearing\n\nimpaired inmate in a correctional setting, rather than on what accommodations were\n\nactually requested and necessary for Pierce to participate in the available programs and\n\nactivities while he was incarcerated at [CTF].”) (emphasis in original).) As mentioned,\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\fthe Court’s legal analysis renders the parties’ various arguments regarding whether and\n\nto what extent Pierce actually requested an interpreter and actually could communicate\n\nin English immaterial to the Court’s conclusion that Pierce is entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Claims I and II. (See supra Part III.A.1.) However, as explained below,\n\nthis Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude on the record presented here that\n\nPierce failed to request an ASL interpreter to assist him while he was detained at CTF,\n\nor that Pierce could communicate effectively without an interpreter, and thus Pierce\n\nwould be entitled to summary judgment on his discrimination claims even if the law is\n\nas the District says it is.\n\n                      a.      The Record Establishes That Pierce Requested An\n                              Interpreter\n\n       The instant record is replete with specific references to Pierce’s multiple\n\nrequests for an ASL interpreter in various contexts during his time at CTF. (See, e.g.,\n\nPierce Dep. 427:12–20, Feb. 25, 2014, Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 34.)\n\nDeposition testimony from the District’s own employees confirms that Pierce\n\nrepeatedly asked for an interpreter. (See, e.g., Tutwiler Dep. 63:4–19, Sept. 9, 2013,\n\nEx. 16 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6, at 10 (Case Manager Tutwiler admitting that Pierce\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter); Allen Dep. 48:16–22, Sept. 10, 2013, Ex. 17 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 26 (Facilities Grievance Coordinator Allen stating that Pierce\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter); McNeal Dep. 31:14–32:3, Sept. 11, 2013, Ex. 19 To\n\nPl.’s Mot, ECF No. 48-6, at 47–48 (Counselor McNeal remarking that Pierce requested\n\nan ASL interpreter).) And the accounts of various eyewitness are not the only proof:\n\ncontemporaneous log book entries, handwritten notes, and memoranda all document\n\nPierce’s persistent efforts to seek and obtain an ASL interpreter from the authorities at\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\fCTF. (See, e.g., Feb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No.\n\n48-6, at 216; Mar. 6, 2012 Memorandum from P. McNeal to W. Fulton, Ex. 34 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 219; CCA logbook entries, Ex. 35 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6,\n\nat 221.)\n\n       Most notably in this regard, the record contains a revealing set of handwritten\n\nnotes between Pierce and his case manager (Tutwiler) in which Pierce writes: “They\n\nviolate my rights here – Thire [sic] was no interpreter for inmate program, Hall\n\nmeeting, or orientation process. I feel I [sic] abandoned. ADA law says there’s a must\n\n[sic] for everyone to access equal!” (See Ex. 36 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 47-6, at 224\n\n(emphasis in original).) To which Tutwiler replies, “[a]s long as we are able to\n\ncommunicate through writing, your rights have not been violated.” (See id.) And\n\nPierce responds, “My writing is not good[;] I feel our communication is vey[sic]\n\nlimited. That’s why I want an interpreter so it could [sic] prevent our misunderstand\n\n[sic]. I want to fully understand what all of you say.” Pierce continues, “It’s not fair[;]\n\neveryone understands whats’[sic] going on here, I dont’[sic] understand at all [sic]\n\nsince I got here.” (See id.)\n\n       Given this telling paper trail and the confirmatory statements of witnesses, this\n\nCourt finds that the District’s suggestion here that Pierce did not, in fact, request an\n\nASL interpreter to assist him while he was incarcerated (see Def.’s Opp’n at 1–2) is\n\npreposterous. Perhaps to avoid losing all credibility with respect to this issue, the\n\nDistrict has also offered a more limited representation: that Pierce’s repeated requests\n\nfor an ASL interpreter were limited to his anger management/substance abuse class, and\n\nthat he did not specifically request an interpreter with respect to any other service or\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\fprogram at CTF. (See Def.’s Reply at 5 (“Pierce only requested an interpreter for one\n\nsetting—his anger management and substance abuse programming—and failed to put\n\nthe District (or its contractors) on notice that he believed he needed an interpreter for\n\nany other type of program or activity.”) (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts ¶ 24 (“Pierce submitted informal resolutions and grievances requesting\n\nan interpreter for anger management and substance abuse programming.”); Def.’s Cont.\n\nFacts ¶ 60 (“The District does not dispute that Pierce made multiple requests for an\n\ninterpreter for the anger management and substance abuse program while he was at\n\nCTF.”); Def.’s Reply at 5 (“Corrections staff reasonably believed on the basis of his\n\nrequests that Pierce felt an interpreter was necessary for him to participate in the anger\n\nmanagement and substance abuse program, but not for other programming, activities, or\n\nevents for which he did not request an interpreter.”). ) Contrary to the District’s\n\ninterpretation of the facts, the record clearly establishes that Pierce made so many\n\nrequests for an ASL interpreter at so many different times that his case manager\n\nactually told him to stop. (See Feb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 216 (Pierce stating “I already requested Ms Tutwlier to find an\n\ninterpreter and she said, stop requesting and forwarded to Mr Fulton.”).) And it is also\n\nclear from the record evidence that Pierce’s requests were not limited to the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse class at all, and in fact, Pierce wanted an interpreter to\n\nhelp him understand most (if not all) of the various conversations that he had with the\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors. For example, on an informal resolution form\n\ndated February 27, 2012, Pierce writes about how CTF had not yet provided him with\n\nan interpreter for his anger management/substance abuse class, and he closes by stating,\n\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\f“[p]lease bring an interpreter for our meeting, because the case is very serious.” (See\n\nFeb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6, at 216.)\n\n       But even if the District was factually correct to assert that Pierce’s request for an\n\ninterpreter extended only to his anger management/substance abuse class, there is no\n\nlegal basis for the District’s related suggestion that Pierce needed to request an\n\ninterpreter with respect to each and every aspect of his prison experience in order to\n\ngive rise to any duty on the part of prison employees to provide that accommodation for\n\nPierce in regard to other significant aspects of his imprisonment. The Eighth Circuit\n\ncase of Randolph v. Rodgers, 170 F.3d 850 (8th Cir. 1999), supports this conclusion.\n\nThere, an inmate who was deaf alleged that the Missouri Department of Corrections\n\n(“MDOC”) had violated Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and\n\nMissouri state law when it failed to provide him with a sign language interpreter during\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. Randolph, 170 F.3d at 853–54. The Randolph court found\n\nthat, while the inmate had not requested an interpreter for his initial disciplinary\n\nproceeding, his subsequent request was sufficient to put the MDOC “on notice” of his\n\nclaim that he could not fully participate in future proceedings without an interpreter,\n\nand thus the MDOC could not be heard to contend that the request for an interpreter\n\nwas limited in scope. Id. at 858. This was especially so because the MDOC had told\n\nthe inmate that his request for an interpreter “is a separate subject [that] will not be\n\ndiscussed[,]’” and thus, it was entirely unsurprising that the prisoner did not request an\n\ninterpreter for subsequent disciplinary proceedings. Id. The Randolph court concluded\n\nthat: “While it is true that public entities are not required to guess at what\n\naccommodations they should provide, the [request] requirement does not narrow the\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\fADA or [Rehabilitation Act] so much that the [MDOC] may claim that [the inmate]\n\nfailed to request an accommodation when it declined to discuss the issue with him.” Id.\n\nat 858–59.\n\n       So it is here. The record shows that Pierce made repeated requests for an ASL\n\ninterpreter with respect to various aspects of his incarceration experience, and that\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors generally declined to discuss the matter further,\n\npreferring to rely on lip reading and handwritten notes. Moreover, as the District\n\nconcedes, Pierce did request an interpreter for the purpose of his anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse class (see Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 61; see also id. ¶ 62\n\n(Pierce represented on one informal resolution form that he “wrote about 8 request\n\nforms” for an interpreter); therefore, even assuming that a specific request for\n\naccommodation was legally required in order for prison officials to have any obligation\n\nto accommodate Pierce, the undisputed facts establish that Pierce did make such a\n\nrequest, and under Randolph, his request was sufficient to put DOC “on notice” that he\n\nmight need a similar accommodation to communicate effectively in other contexts as\n\nwell. Thus, this Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude on this record that\n\nPierce had failed to mount the request hurdle (assuming there is one), and as a result, no\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact remains with respect to whether or not Pierce made an\n\nadequate request for an interpreter, even under the District’s view of the applicable\n\ndiscrimination standard.\n\n                     b.     The Record Shows That Pierce Needed An Interpreter\n\n       The record here also clearly establishes that Pierce cannot communicate\n\neffectively in English, and thus no reasonable jury could find otherwise. It is\n\nundisputed that Pierce is profoundly deaf and that he ordinarily communicates through\n\n\n                                            42\n\fASL. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 1, 3; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 1.) ASL is not derived\n\nfrom English; ASL has its own syntax and grammar and utilizes signs made by hand\n\nmotions, facial expressions, eye gazes, and body postures. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4;\n\nDef.’s Cont. Facts ¶ 4.) Therefore, the vast majority of deaf people—Pierce included—\n\nlack the ability to communicate effectively in English, whether by writing notes or\n\nreading lips. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 5, 7, 10; see also Expert Report of Prof.\n\nBienvenu, Ex. 3 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 104 (expert in Deaf culture, literacy,\n\nand ASL assessment concluding that “[b]oth my personal interaction with Pierce and\n\nthe case-related documents I reviewed to prepare this report lead me to strongly believe\n\nthat Pierce, at a minimum, requires both quality ASL interpretation services and\n\nvideophone telecommunications technology to effectively communicate with others”\n\n(emphasis in original)).) 13\n\n        Despite this evidence, the District asserts that Pierce actually can communicate\n\neffectively in English, through both written notes and lip reading. See 28 C.F.R. part\n\n\n13\n  Pierce has offered the testimony of two experts—Martina Bienvenu and Richard Ray—both of whom\nthe District has moved to exclude. (See Def.’s Mot. to Preclude Pl.’s Experts, ECF No. 46.) Pierce\nsays that Bienvenu would testify about ASL, deaf culture, literacy within the deaf community, lip-\nreading, the importance of using qualified ASL interpreters, and Pierce’s own communicative abilities\nand needs. (See Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot to Preclude Pl.’s Experts, ECF No. 57, at 5.) Ray would\ngive expert testimony about the accommodations that would have provided Pierce with the means to\ncommunicate effectively and have meaningful access to prison programs, services, and activities during\nPierce’s incarceration in early 2012. (See id. at 6.) The District argues that neither of these experts will\nhelp the trier of fact because their testimony does not speak to what accommodations were necessary\nfor the Plaintiff in this case, as opposed to the deaf community at large. (See Def.’s Mot. to Preclude\nPl.’s Experts at 4–5.) The District also argues that the proffered testimony is not based on sufficient\nfacts, and is not the product of reliable scientific methods, because the experts did not evaluate what\naccommodations were available at CTF, what accommodations Pierce actually requested, and what\naccommodations were necessary for Pierce to participate in the programs and activities at CTF. (See\nid. at 5–9.) Even assuming arguendo that the District’s objections have a sound legal basis, they\nclearly relate to the weight of the proffered expert testimony, not its admissibility. See Fox v.\nDannenberg, 906 F.2d 1253, 1257 (8th Cir. 1990) (“[I]t is . . . for the jury, with the assistance of\nvigorous cross-examination, to measure the worth of the opinion[s]”) (citation and internal quotations\nomitted); see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., 509 U.S. 579, 596 (1993) (Rule 702 favors the\nadmission of expert witness testimony over its exclusion). Therefore, the District’s motion to preclude\nBienvenu and Ray’s testimony is DENIED.\n\n\n\n                                                    43\n\f35, App. A (noting that if the public entity does not provide a disabled person with their\n\nrequested accommodation, the public entity must “demonstrate that another effective\n\nmeans of communication” was provided). The District’s contention regarding Pierce’s\n\nwriting ability is based on its assertion that Pierce “is college educated, has researched\n\nand written term papers for high school and college courses, wrote an autobiography\n\nduring his anger management and substance abuse [class] at CTF, . . . scored above\n\naverage on a written test administered at CTF to assess his reading and writing\n\nabilities[,]” and “communicates with his mother, who lives out of state, through written\n\nFacebook messages.” (See Def. Mot. at 2.) And with respect to lip reading, the District\n\nasserts that the prison employees and contractors who dealt with Pierce believed they\n\nwere effectively communicating with him through lip-reading because Pierce gave\n\nappropriate responses to their oral questions. (See Def.’s Opp’n at 10–11.)\n\n       This Court finds that none of these observations is sufficient to create any\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding Pierce’s alleged inability to engage in the kinds of\n\ncomplex communications that are required to navigate one’s way through the prison\n\nsystem and to understand official communications regarding medical treatment,\n\nrehabilitative classes, and custodial issues, for several reasons. With respect to the\n\ncollege-level courses that Pierce purportedly took, the record indicates that, although\n\nPierce did attempt to take certain classes, he dropped out after a short period of time.\n\n(See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 12; see also Pierce Dep. 32:21–35:2, Oct. 10, 2013, Ex. 1 to\n\nPl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 13–16.) Pierce’s high school research papers were only a\n\nfew pages long, and the record shows that it not only took him two months to write each\n\npaper, he also had classmates edit the papers before he submitted final drafts. (See Pl.’s\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fCont. Facts ¶ 13.) Similarly, Pierce apparently asked another inmate to correct his\n\nautobiography for the anger management/substance abuse class, to “edit from, you\n\nknow quote/unquote, deaf language.” (See Pierce Dep. 245:17–247:21, Feb. 24, 2014,\n\nEx. 2 to Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 58-5, at 9–11.) And whatever Pierce’s score may have\n\nbeen on the standard inmate reading and writing assessment, Pierce’s “above average”\n\nperformance in a test situation says little about his overall ability to understand and to\n\ncommunicate effectively in the context of discussions with prison doctors, teachers, and\n\nother officials.\n\n       Similarly, it goes almost without saying that the District’s argument that Pierce\n\ncould read lips because the District’s employees believed that he could is a nonstarter;\n\nthe District has not shown that its employees had any prior knowledge of, or had\n\nreceived any training about, communicating with deaf inmates. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 34, 36.) Furthermore, because the prison staff did not undertake any genuine\n\nassessment of Pierce’s limitations and abilities whatsoever, their lay opinions about\n\nwhat worked for Pierce and what Pierce could do amounted to entirely uninformed\n\nspeculation that provides no support for any motion of summary judgment or opposition\n\nthereto. Cf. Lucas v. Ozmint, CIV.A. No. 9:10-0017-CMC-BM, 2011 WL 6979995, at\n\n*6 (D.S.C. Sept. 15, 2011) report and recommendation adopted, C/A No. 9:10-17-CMC-\n\nBM, 2012 WL 77178 (D.S.C. Jan. 10, 2012) (noting that “rank speculation is not\n\nevidence”). This all means that the expert testimony and evidence that supports\n\nPierce’s claim that he needed an ASL interpreter in order to communicate effectively\n\nwhile he was incarcerated—i.e., in order to give information to, and to receive\n\ninformation from, prison officials and others with whom he interacted—stands\n\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\funrebutted, and in this Court’s view, that evidence is sufficient to establish Pierce’s\n\nneed for an interpreter, even under the District’s legal standard.\n\n       This Court also finds that the District has failed to show that providing an\n\ninterpreter for Pierce would have posed an unduly burdensome financial or\n\nadministrative hardship. See Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson, 525 F.3d 1256, 1266\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (explaining that, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case for\n\ndisability discrimination, the defendant may assert that accommodating the plaintiffs’\n\ndisabilities would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden or\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, as an affirmative defense to liability).\n\nWhile the District maintains that the provision of anything other than a TTY machine\n\nfor Pierce in order to accommodate his request for telecommunications would have been\n\nan undue burden (see Def.’s Opp’n at 13), and implies that permitting deaf inmates who\n\nare in protective custody to have visitation without handcuffs would be a fundamental\n\nalteration of existing policy (see id. at 17–18), the District makes no such “undue\n\nburden” or “fundamental alteration” contention with respect to Pierce’s request for an\n\ninterpreter, nor could it reasonably have done so, because the DOC apparently has taken\n\nthe official position that ASL interpreters should be provided as a matter of policy.\n\n(See D.C. Dep’t of Corr. Program Statement 3800.3, Ex. 9 to Rocap Decl., ECF No. 48-\n\n5, at 92 § 12(a)(2) (“Written communication cannot be used as a substitute where the\n\nindividual has expressed a preference for a sign language interpreter.”).)\n\n       Finally, with respect to the parties’ disputes of fact regarding the extent to which\n\nPierce was (or was not) denied equal access to accommodations other than an ASL\n\ninterpreter (e.g., use of the TTY machine, official notifications, and CTF’s visitation\n\n\n\n\n                                            46\n\fprocedures), the Court notes that Pierce has alleged that he was treated unequally with\n\nrespect to these aspects of his prison experience in addition to being denied an\n\ninterpreter, and these various alleged instances of discrimination are cited as alternative\n\nbases for finding that the District violated Section 504 and Title II. Thus, the Court\n\nfinds that it need go no further than to conclude that Pierce would be entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on Claims I and II on the basis of Pierce’s unfulfilled request for an\n\nASL interpreter. That is, even if the law is as the District says it is, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find that Pierce failed to request an interpreter, that he needed an interpreter, and\n\nthat the District could have—but did not—provide an interpreter for Pierce with respect\n\nto significant aspects of his incarceration experience. As a result, there is no need for\n\nthe Court to decide whether any genuine issues of fact exist with respect to the prison’s\n\nprovision of telecommunications, notifications, or visitation.\n\n              3.     Because The District Committed Intentional Discrimination, Pierce\n                     Is Entitled To Compensatory Damages On Claims I and II\n\n       At this point, the Court has concluded that the District’s failure to evaluate\n\nPierce’s need for accommodation constituted a violation of Section 504 and Title II as a\n\nmatter of law. (See Part III.A.1 supra.) It has also determined, in the alternative, that\n\neven if the District was only legally obligated to accommodate Pierce’s hearing\n\ndisability if he requested an ASL interpreter and actually needed one, there is no\n\ngenuine dispute that Pierce cannot communicate effectively in English and thus needed\n\nan ASL interpreter in the prison context, or that Pierce actually requested an ASL\n\ninterpreter, which the District could have provided to him. (See Part III.A.2 supra.) In\n\neither case, all that remains of Claims I and II of Pierce’s complaint is the question of\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f        The remedies available for violations of Section 504 and Title II are the remedies\n\nthat pertain to a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, subject to certain defenses\n\nspecific to public entities. See 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2) (2012) (the “remedies,\n\nprocedures, and rights” available under the Rehabilitation Act are those set forth in\n\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); 42 U.S.C. § 12133 (2012) (providing that the\n\n“remedies, procedures, and rights” for violations of Title II of the ADA are those set\n\nforth in the Rehabilitation Act); see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 n.13\n\n(1985) (“Although § 504 ultimately was passed as part of the Rehabilitation Act of\n\n1973, the nondiscrimination principle later codified in § 504 was initially proposed as\n\nan amendment to Title VI.”). A plaintiff may recover compensatory damages for\n\nviolations of Title II of the ADA or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act if he proves\n\nthat the defendant’s discriminatory actions were intentional. See Liese v. Indian River\n\nCnty. Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 344 (11th Cir. 2012); Meagley v. City of Little Rock,\n\n639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011); Ferguson v. City of Phoenix, 157 F.3d 668, 674 (9th\n\nCir. 1998). 14\n\n        In disability discrimination lawsuits, many courts have authorized plaintiffs to\n\nestablish intentional conduct by establishing that the defendant acted with “deliberate\n\nindifference” to the plaintiff’s rights. See Proctor v. Prince George’s Hosp. Ctr., 32 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 820, 829 (D. Md. 1998) (“The question of intent in accommodations cases\n\ndoes not require that plaintiff show that defendants harbored an animus towards her or\n\nthose disabled such as she. Rather, intentional discrimination is shown by an\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Punitive damages are not recoverable in private suits under Title II of the ADA or Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act. See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 189 (2002).\n\n\n\n                                                   48\n\fintentional, or willful, violation of the Act itself.”) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted); see also id. at 829 n.6 (noting that “the level of proof necessary for\n\nfinding intentional discrimination under [the] Rehabilitation Act means a deliberate\n\nindifference to a strong likelihood that a violation of federal rights would result”).\n\nDeliberate indifference is “knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is\n\nsubstantially likely, and a failure to act upon that likelihood.” Duvall, 260 F.3d at 1139\n\n(citation omitted). The “knowledge” element is satisfied where the public entity has\n\nnotice of the plaintiff’s accommodation need, and the “failure to act” element is\n\nsatisfied by conduct that is “more than negligent, and involves an element of\n\ndeliberateness.” Id.\n\n       Notably, while the D.C. Circuit has not addressed the appropriate legal standard\n\nfor establishing intentional discrimination in violation of Section 504 and Title II, the\n\nmajority of circuits that have considered the standards issue have held that the\n\n“deliberate indifference” standard is appropriate. See, e.g., S.H. ex rel. Durrell v.\n\nLower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263 (3d Cir. 2013) (adopting the deliberate\n\nindifference standard); Liese v. Indian River Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 348 (11th\n\nCir. 2012) (same); Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011)\n\n(same); Duvall v. Cnty. of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1138 (9th Cir. 2001) (same); Powers\n\nv. MJB Acquisition Corp., 184 F.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999) (same); Bartlett v. N.Y.\n\nState Bd. of Law Exam’rs, 156 F.3d 321, 331 (2d Cir. 1998) (same), vacated on other\n\ngrounds 527 U.S. 1031 (1999). Two circuits have suggested that plaintiffs suing under\n\nTitle II and Section 504 should bear a heavier burden than showing mere deliberate\n\nindifference, such as showing actual animus against disabled persons, see, e.g., Nieves-\n\n\n\n\n                                             49\n\fMárquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 126–27 (1st Cir. 2003) (suggesting that\n\ndiscriminatory animus is the level of intent required); Delano–Pyle v. Victoria Cnty.,\n\nTex., 302 F.3d 567, 575 (5th Cir. 2002) (explicitly rejecting deliberate indifference\n\nstandard and instead suggesting that an unnamed, but more demanding, showing is\n\nnecessary); however, this Court agrees with the vast majority of the courts of appeals\n\nthat the deliberate indifference standard “is better suited to the remedial goals of the\n\n[Rehabilitation Act] and the ADA than is the discriminatory animus alternative.” S.H.\n\nex rel. Durrell, 729 F.3d at 264. As the Supreme Court has reasoned, Congress was\n\nkeenly aware of the evils of benign neglect when it enacted the federal\n\nantidiscrimination statutes, and “[f]ederal agencies and commentators on the plight of\n\nthe handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is\n\nprimarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.” Alexander,\n\n469 U.S. at 296. Thus, the Rehabilitation Act and ADA “are targeted to address ‘more\n\nsubtle forms of discrimination’ than merely ‘obviously exclusionary conduct[,]’” and it\n\nis “[c]onsistent with these motivations” to employ “a standard of deliberate\n\nindifference, rather than one that targets animus” in this context. S.H. ex rel. Durrell,\n\n729 F.3d at 248 (quoting Chapman v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.) Inc., 631 F.3d 939, 945 (9th\n\nCir. 2011).) 15\n\n\n\n\n15\n  Notably, in the instant case, neither party appears to object to Court’s application of the deliberate\nindifference standard (see Pl.’s Mot. at 14 (citing only cases that apply the deliberate indifference\nstandard and none that require animus); Def.’s Mot. at 19 (same)). Furthermore, at least one other\ncourt in this district has applied the deliberate indifference standard in a case involving disability\ndiscrimination. See Hunter ex rel. A.H. v. District of Columbia, 64 F. Supp. 3d 158, 168 n.8 (D.D.C.\n2014) (noting that the D.C. Circuit has not addressed the appropriate standard for intentional\ndiscrimination, and assuming, without deciding, that the deliberate indifference standard applies).\n\n\n\n                                                    50\n\f       This Court’s conclusion that the deliberate indifference standard is applicable\n\nhere makes short work of the damages analysis. It is well established that “[d]eliberate\n\nindifference requires [only] knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is\n\nsubstantially likely, and a failure to act upon that likelihood[,]” Duvall, 260 F.3d at\n\n1139, and the District’s knowing failure to evaluate Pierce’s need for accommodation\n\nand to provide the auxiliary aids easily satisfies this standard. The District’s employees\n\nand contractors knew that Pierce had a hearing disability, and yet they did not\n\nundertake an assessment of the accommodations that Pierce might need in order to\n\naccess prison services, nor did they provide him with an ASL interpreter for all\n\nsignificant interactions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 60–64, 77, 88–89, 97, 101, 107.)\n\nThis willful blindness to Pierce’s hearing disability and his need for accommodation\n\nplainly amounts to deliberate indifference, and Pierce is therefore entitled to\n\ncompensatory damages on Claims I and II of his complaint. See, e.g., Bartlett, 970 F.\n\nSupp. at 1151 (holding that defendant was deliberately indifferent where it was aware\n\nof plaintiff’s disability and refused to accommodate the plaintiff).\n\n       B.     There Is A Genuine Dispute Of Fact Regarding Whether Or Not\n              Pierce Was Placed In Protective Custody In Retaliation For His\n              Requests For Accommodation\n\n       Pierce alleges in Claim III of his complaint that the District violated the ADA\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act by “retailat[ing] against [him] for asserting his rights” under\n\nthose statutes. (See Compl. ¶ 51.) Pierce maintains that the District changed his\n\nconditions of confinement for the worse by placing him in protective custody and then\n\nmoving him to the Special Management Unit (“SMU”) within CTF in order to punish\n\nhim for his repeated requests for an ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–47.) The\n\nDistrict seeks summary judgment on this claim, contending that no adverse action was\n\n\n                                            51\n\ftaken against Pierce—he was placed in protective custody because he stated that\n\nanother inmate had threatened him, and he was moved to the SMU for administrative\n\nconvenience. (See Def.’s Mot. at 18.)\n\n        Generally speaking, to prevail on a retaliation claim brought under Section 504\n\nand Title II, a plaintiff must satisfy the burden-shifting framework articulated in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and its progeny, see, e.g.,\n\nSolomon v. Vilsack, 763 F.3d 1, 14 (D.C. Cir. 2014). Pursuant to this framework, the\n\nplaintiff first makes a prima facie case of retaliation; then, the burden shifts to the\n\ndefendant to identify “some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the adverse\n\naction, McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; and if the defendant does this, the burden\n\nshifts yet again such that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s stated reason for\n\nthe adverse action was merely a “pretext” for the real, retaliatory purpose, id. at 804.\n\nBecause the District—and the District alone—has moved for summary judgment in its\n\nfavor on Pierce’s retaliation claim, its task under Rule 56 is to demonstrate that no\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that retaliatory animus motivated prison officials with\n\nrespect to Pierce’s placement in protective custody, a task that the District might\n\naccomplish by demonstrating that Pierce cannot establish a prima facie case for\n\nretaliation, or by showing that there is no genuine issue that District’s proffered\n\nexplanation was not a pretext. As explained below, the District has done neither in this\n\ncase.\n\n              1.     Taking All Facts And Inferences In The Non-Movant’s Favor, A\n                     Reasonable Jury Could Find That The Evidence Establishes A\n                     Prima Facie Case For Retaliation\n\n        Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case that\n\ncreates a presumption of retaliation by showing (1) that he engaged in a protected\n\n\n                                             52\n\factivity; (2) that the defendant took adverse action against him; and (3) that there was a\n\ncausal link between the plaintiff’s request for an accommodation and the adverse\n\naction. See Alston v. District of Columbia, 561 F. Supp. 2d 29, 40 (D.D.C. 2008);\n\nDuncan v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth., 425 F. Supp. 2d 121, 126 (D.D.C. 2006). 16\n\nHere, as noted above, Pierce identifies two alleged instances of retaliation. First, Pierce\n\nclaims that prison officials placed him in protective custody because he kept asking for\n\nan ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–46.) As Pierce tells the story, he repeatedly\n\nasked Tutwiler (his case manager) for an interpreter (see Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 61), and\n\nhe continued to do so even after Tutwiler told him to stop (see id. ¶ 62). Then, on\n\nFebruary 23, 2012, less than one week after Tutwiler made a note that Pierce “continues\n\nto write request for an interpret [sic] for anger management and drug education” (id.\n\n¶ 61), another inmate shoved Pierce in the TV room and Pierce went to Tutwiler for\n\nassistance (see id. ¶ 102). Tutwiler purportedly asked Pierce if he would like to be\n\nplaced in protective custody—without explaining to him what protective custody was,\n\nwhy it is ordinarily used, how long it would last, or how to request release back into the\n\ngeneral population. (See id. ¶¶ 104, 106.) And when Pierce responded “If necessary[,]”\n\nhe was summarily placed in protective custody in Medical 82, where his freedom of\n\nmovement was substantially more limited. (See Pierce Dep. at 236:5 (stating that\n\nMedical 82 is “complete lockdown”).) Pierce contends that these facts give rise to a\n\nplausible inference that Tutwiler placed him in protective custody in retaliation for his\n\nrequests for an interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45.)\n\n\n\n16\n   Because the test for retaliation under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act was originally developed in\nthe employment discrimination context, the standards articulated in employment discrimination cases\nare applicable to disability discrimination cases. See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40.\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\f       Second, Pierce claims that he was retaliated against when he was transferred to\n\nthe SMU while he was in protective custody status and was kept there longer than\n\nnecessary. (See id. at 46–47.) Pierce alleges that, after he went into protective custody\n\non February 23, 2012, he filed two informal resolutions (on February 27, 2012 and\n\nMarch 2, 2012) requesting an interpreter and complaining about limitations on his use\n\nof the TTY. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 62, 132.) Then, on March 1, 2012, Assistant\n\nWarden Fulton was made aware of Pierce’s desire to leave protective custody and to\n\nhave an attorney, but instead of granting Pierce’s requests, Assistant Warden Fulton\n\nallegedly advised the staff to and “review” Pierce’s status again in one week, forcing\n\nPierce to remain in protective custody. (See id. ¶ 109.) Furthermore, in the interim—\n\non March 4, 2012—Pierce was allegedly transferred to the SMU, a unit Pierce describes\n\nas “much, much worse” than his prior protective custody circumstances. (See id. ¶ 111;\n\nsee also Pierce Dep. at 235:20–236:5.) Based on these facts, Pierce alleges that\n\nAssistant Warden Fulton both kept Pierce in protective custody and transferred Pierce\n\nfrom Medical 82 to the Special Management Unit in retaliation for Pierce’s requests for\n\nan interpreter and greater access to the TTY.\n\n       This Court concludes that Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on the\n\ngrounds that Pierce’s has failed to make out the elements of a prima facie case because\n\nPierce has made plausible allegations—supported by evidence—that (1) he engaged in a\n\nprotected activity; (2) the defendant took adverse action against him; and (3) there was\n\na causal link between the plaintiff’s request for an accommodation and the adverse\n\naction. See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40; see also Holcomb v. Powell, 433 F.3d 889,\n\n903 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“At the prima facie stage of a retaliation claim, a plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\fburden ‘is not great; [she] merely needs to establish facts adequate to permit an\n\ninference of retaliatory motive.’”); see also id. (reversing grant of summary judgment to\n\nemployer because employee had shown that she engaged in a protected activity and the\n\nemployer took adverse action against her shortly thereafter). There is no question that\n\nPierce’s request for an interpreter was a protected activity. See Solomon, 763 F.3d at\n\n15 (noting that a good faith request for reasonable accommodation constitutes a\n\nprotected activity pursuant to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act). Moreover, Pierce\n\nalleges that placing him in protective custody in Medical 82 and then transferring him\n\nto the SMU were adverse actions because Pierce alleges that the conditions of\n\nconfinement in both of those units were worse than in the general population. See\n\nForkkio v. Powell, 306 F.3d 1127, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting that a plaintiff suffers\n\nan adverse action where there are “materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges” of plaintiff’s status with defendant). And Pierce claims that it\n\nis reasonable to infer that the District kept Pierce out of the relative comfort of general\n\npopulation because Tutwiler was fed up with his requests and/or wished to punish him\n\nfor his requests for accommodation. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 46.)\n\n       Although the District concedes that a request for accommodation is a protected\n\nactivity under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and that Pierce made such a request\n\n(see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 24), it argues that “Pierce’s retaliation claim fails because\n\nhe cannot show that the District or any of its contractors at CTF took any adverse action\n\nagainst him as a result of his requests for accommodation, much less that any alleged\n\nadverse action would not have occurred ‘but for’ his requests for accommodation.”\n\n(Def.’s Mot. at 17.) But the District is wrong to contend that the only cognizable\n\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\f“adverse action” in the prison context is a disciplinary infraction (see Def.’s Mot. at\n\n18); indeed, it is well established that any “decision causing a significant change in\n\nbenefits” can constitute an adverse action for the purpose of a retaliation claim. Cf.\n\nBowie v. Ashcroft, 283 F. Supp. 2d 25, 30 (D.D.C. 2003) (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted) (defining “adverse action” in the employment context). 17 And when\n\nthe facts that appear on the record in this case are viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe non-movant plaintiff this Court finds that a reasonable jury could certainly conclude\n\nthat the conditions in Medical 82 and the Special Management Unit were such that\n\nPierce’s placement, and continued detention, in those units constituted a change in the\n\nconditions of confinement that amounted to an adverse action. 18\n\n        A reasonable jury could also conclude on this record that the District moved\n\nPierce into protective custody in Medical 82, and later transferred him to the Special\n\nManagement Unit, because of Pierce’s requests for accommodation. There is a close\n\ntemporal connection between the protected activity and the alleged adverse actions, and\n\nit is clear that such proximity can support an inference of causation. See Alston, 561 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 43 (citing Woodruff v. Peters, 482 F.3d 521, 529 (D.C. Cir. 2007)). That is,\n\na reasonable jury could believe Pierce’s assertion that Tutwiler placed him in protective\n\ncustody without explaining to him what that was less than one week after she wrote in\n\n\n\n17\n  Although Bowie v. Ashcroft, 283 F. Supp. 2d 25 (D.D.C. 2003) discusses the definition of “adverse\naction” in the employment context, the test for retaliation under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act was\noriginally developed in the employment discrimination context. See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40.\nAccordingly, the standards articulated in employment discrimination cases are applicable here. See id.\n18\n   Pierce’s evidence must be credited and all reasonable inferences must be construed in his favor\nbecause the motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim belongs to the District. See Estate\nof Parsons v. Palestinian Auth., 651 F.3d 118, 123 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“The evidence of the non-movant\nis to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                    56\n\fher notes that Pierce was continuously requesting an interpreter in order to end his\n\nincessant entreaties. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 61, 102, 104, 106.) Similarly, a\n\nreasonable jury might find that Pierce was transferred to the Special Management Unit\n\nless than one week after he filed informal resolution forms requesting an interpreter and\n\ncomplaining about the limitations on his use of the TTY (see id. ¶¶ 62, 109, 132),\n\nbecause he had made those requests for accommodation. Indeed, “courts have\n\nrecognized that proof of causal connection can be established indirectly by showing that\n\nprotected activity is followed by discriminatory treatment.” Mitchell v. Baldrige, 759\n\nF.2d 80, 86 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Therefore, the District has failed to show that Pierce cannot make out a prima\n\nfacie case on his retaliation claim in a manner that entitles it to summary judgment.\n\n              2.     A Reasonable Jury Could Conclude That The District’s Proffered\n                     Reasons For Placing Pierce In Protective Custody Are Pretextual\n\n       Nor has the District shown that it would be impossible for a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that its proffered explanation for sending Pierce to protective custody in Medical\n\n82, and then allegedly keeping him there longer than requested while transferring him\n\nto the Special Management Unit, was pretext for retaliation. In fulfillment of its\n\nobligation to proffer “some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for its actions,\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, the District argues that it placed Pierce in\n\nprotective custody because Pierce had stated that he feared for his safety, not because of\n\nhis repeated requests for an interpreter (see Def.’s Mot. at 18), and it points out that it\n\nis standard policy at CTF that inmates who request protective custody must be taken out\n\nof general population (see Def.’s Stmt. Of Facts ¶ 157). Thus, far from retaliating\n\nagainst Pierce, the District asserts that Tutwiler was merely following protocol when\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\fshe placed Pierce—who had just reported that he had been pushed by another inmate\n\nand had written out on a protective custody request form that “I fear for my safety”—in\n\nprotective custody. (See Def.’s Mot. at 17; see also Tutwiler Aff., Ex. 11 to Def.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 52-5, ¶¶ 26–31.) But Pierce disputes the District’s assertion that he\n\nactually requested protective custody status knowingly and voluntarily, and in fact, he\n\nargues that Tutwiler deliberately failed to explain to him what protective custody\n\nmeans. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–46.) Similarly, Pierce contends that a reasonable jury\n\ncould disbelieve the District’s assertion that Pierce was kept in protective custody\n\nbecause he wouldn’t sign the waiver form (Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 167–70), and that he\n\nwas moved from Medical 82 to the Special Management Unit because bed space was\n\nneeded in Medical 82 for an inmate who had serious medical needs (see id. ¶¶ 161, 165;\n\nsee also Fulton Aff., Ex. 2 to Def.’s Mot., ECF No. 52-2, ¶ 31), based on the close\n\ntemporal proximity between the move and his filing of an internal grievance. (See Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 47.)\n\n      It is clear to this Court that there are genuine issues of fact regarding whether it\n\nwas because of his repeated requests for an interpreter and his filing of complaints that\n\nprison officials and employees segregated Pierce initially and held him in that allegedly\n\nundesirable segregated status longer than was necessary, and that the resolution of these\n\nfactual disputes depends on the credibility of the testimony of prison staff. Thus, the\n\nretaliation claim cannot be decided by this Court as a matter of law. See Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. at 255 (noting that “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the\n\nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fthose of a judge”). Accordingly, the District’s motion for summary judgment on\n\nPierce’s retaliation claim must be denied.\n\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The record in this matter clearly reveals that, when Pierce arrived at CTF to be\n\ntaken into custody, prison officials took no steps whatsoever to evaluate his need for\n\naccommodation so that he would be able to have meaningful access to prison programs\n\nand services within the prison facility. The District’s employees and contractors knew\n\nthat Pierce was profoundly deaf, but instead of engaging in an interactive process\n\ndesigned to ascertain what accommodations would be necessary for Pierce to\n\ncommunicate effectively in prison, they merely assumed that he could read (and\n\nunderstand) the words they mouthed to him and the notes they wrote to him, even after\n\nhe told them “I dont’[sic] understand at all [sic] since I got here” and specifically\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter. It is no wonder that Pierce was confused and upset\n\nthroughout his 51-days in custody, and once even woefully declared, “I feel I [sic]\n\nabandoned.”\n\n       What is astonishing, however, is the District’s insistence in the context of this\n\nlawsuit that its employees’ conduct with respect to accommodating Pierce’s hearing\n\ndisability was entirely consistent with the law. The text and purpose of the\n\nRehabilitation Act and the ADA clearly establish otherwise, and as a result, this Court\n\neasily concludes that the District’s willful blindness regarding Pierce’s need for\n\naccommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment\n\nof auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what\n\nthe law requires. Perhaps most significantly, this Court holds that the District’s clear\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\fviolation of Section 504 and Title II was manifest from the start, when prison\n\nemployees took no steps whatsoever to ascertain what accommodations this new inmate\n\nwith a known hearing disability would require so that communications with him would\n\nbe “as effective as communications with others,” for the purpose of ensuring that he had\n\n“an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of” the prison’s services,\n\nprograms, and activities. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.160(a)(1), (b)(1)–(2).\n\n       Because this Court finds that the District’s deliberate indifference to Pierce’s\n\naccommodation needs violated Section 504 and Title II as a matter of law, Pierce’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on Claims I and II of the complaint will be GRANTED.\n\nMoreover, the Court finds that the District’s motion for summary judgment must be\n\nDENIED in its entirety, because not only does this Court conclude that the District\n\nunlawfully failed to provide Pierce with meaningful access to prison services, it also\n\nholds that, on the instant record, a reasonable jury could find that CTF employees\n\nretaliated against Pierce as well. Thus, in accordance with the accompanying order, all\n\nthat remains of Pierce’s complaint for trial is the determination of the amount of\n\ncompensatory damages to be awarded to Pierce with respect to Claims I and II, and the\n\nissue of liability (and, if necessary, damages) for Claim III.\n\n\n\n\nDATE: September 11, 2015                  Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                          KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                          United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            60\n\f",

Plaintiff William Pierce—who is profoundly\n\ndeaf and communicates with American Sign Language—claims that prison officials in\n\nthe District of Columbia violated his right to be free from unlawful disability\n\ndiscrimination in 2012, when Pierce was incarcerated in the District’s Correctional\n\nTreatment Facility following his guilty plea to a simple assault that arose out of a\n\ndomestic dispute with his then-partner. The District’s prison staff was indisputably\n\naware that Pierce was deaf; however, during the entire 51-day period in which Pierce\n\nwas held in custody, no staff person ever assessed Pierce’s need for accommodation or\n\notherwise undertook to determine the type of assistance that he would need to\n\ncommunicate effectively with others during his incarceration. Instead, according to\n\nPierce, the District’s employees and contractors merely assumed that lip-reading and\n\fexchanging written notes would suffice, and they largely ignored his repeated requests\n\nfor an interpreter to assist him in interacting with other people. As a result, Pierce\n\nasserts that he was forced to serve his prison time in abject isolation, generally unaware\n\nof what was going on around him and unable to communicate effectively with prison\n\nofficials, prison doctors, his counselor, his teacher, or his fellow inmates. Pierce has\n\nfiled the instant lawsuit against the District under the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nof 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-336, 104 Stat. 327 (1990), codified as amended at 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 12101–12213, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355\n\n(1973), codified as amended at 29 U.S.C. §§ 701–796, seeking damages for allegedly\n\nhaving been denied an effective means of receiving or imparting information at various\n\ncritical points during his period of incarceration, including medical appointments,\n\nrehabilitative classes, and meetings with prison officials. (See Compl., ECF No. 1,\n\n¶¶ 22, 49–50.) Pierce also maintains that he was held in solitary confinement as\n\npunishment for his repeated requests for an interpreter, and thus, that the District’s\n\nemployees and contractors retaliated against him in violation of federal law. (See id.\n\n¶¶ 30, 45, 51.)\n\n       Before this Court at present are the parties’ cross motions for summary\n\njudgment. (See Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. as to Claims I and II of the Compl., ECF\n\nNo. 47; Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 49.) The parties\n\nvehemently disagree about many of the facts related to this case—most notably,\n\nwhether Pierce actually had the ability to communicate effectively through lip-reading\n\nand written notes, and also whether Pierce actually requested an interpreter as an\n\naccommodation for his hearing disability. But in this Court’s view, only one fact is\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\ftruly material to the question of whether or not Pierce was discriminated against on the\n\nbasis of his disability and is thus entitled to summary judgment on his discrimination\n\nclaims (Claims I and II of the complaint), and that fact is entirely undisputed: when\n\nPierce first arrived at the prison facility, the District’s employees and contractors did\n\nnothing to evaluate Pierce’s need for accommodation, despite their knowledge that he\n\nwas disabled. They did not ask Pierce what type of auxiliary aids he needed. They did\n\nnot hire an expert to assess Pierce’s ability to communicate through written notes or lip-\n\nreading as opposed to sign language. They did not even consult the Department of\n\nCorrections’ own policies to figure out what types of accommodations are ordinarily\n\nprovided to inmates with hearing disabilities. Instead, they figuratively shrugged and\n\neffectively sat on their hands with respect to this plainly hearing-disabled person in\n\ntheir custody, presumably content to rely on their own uninformed beliefs about how\n\nbest to handle him and certainly failing to engage in any meaningful assessment of his\n\nneeds. This Court finds that, in so doing, the District denied Pierce meaningful access\n\nto prison services and intentionally discriminated against him on the basis of his\n\ndisability in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act. Thus, Pierce is entitled to summary judgment and\n\ncompensatory damages on Claims I and II of his complaint.\n\n       With respect to the District’s motion for summary judgment on Pierce’s\n\nretaliation claim (Claim III), this Court finds that there is a genuine issue of material\n\nfact regarding whether or not Pierce’s placement in solitary confinement was an act of\n\nunlawful retaliation—Pierce contends that prison employees were responding to his\n\nrepeated requests for an interpreter and the complaints he had made about the prison’s\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\ffailure to provide accommodations, while the District claims that Pierce was segregated\n\nfrom the general prison population in order to protect him from the violent threats of\n\nother inmates. Pierce’s retaliation claim thus involves a genuine dispute of fact that is\n\nnot appropriately resolved on summary judgment.\n\n       Accordingly, Pierce’s motion for summary judgment with respect to Claims I and\n\nII of the complaint will be GRANTED, and the District’s motion for summary\n\njudgment as to Claims I, II, and III will be DENIED. A separate order consistent with\n\nthis memorandum opinion will follow.\n\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       A.      Basic Facts †\n\n       William Pierce is a resident of the District of Columbia who is profoundly deaf\n\nand has other serious medical conditions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Undisputed Material Facts\n\n(“Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts”), ECF No. 48-1, ¶ 1; Compl. ¶ 4.) Pierce can make sounds that\n\nare audible, but he cannot speak words, and American Sign Language (“ASL”) is his\n\nnative language. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 2, 3.) 1 Pierce relies on ASL to\n\ncommunicate with others—either by interacting directly with other persons who are\n\nusing ASL themselves, or through the use of a video conferencing device that involves\n\na remote interpreter. (See id. ¶¶ 8–9.) Pierce cannot, and does not, use a traditional\n\ntelephone; instead, he ordinarily uses ASL via videophone to communicate with hearing\n\nindividuals. (See id.) Moreover, because Pierce’s proficiency in reading and writing\n\n\n†\n  Certain facts have been redacted from this Memorandum Opinion by agreement of the parties. These\nredactions are represented herein by the characters “[******].”\n1\n ASL is a language comprised of hand motions, facial expressions, eye gazes, and body postures. (See\nPl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4.) Although many deaf people in the United States use ASL to communicate,\nASL’s syntax and grammar are not derived from English. (See id.)\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fEnglish is far below that of a hearing person, he rarely writes notes and only uses\n\ncellphone texting to convey simple, short messages. (See id. ¶¶ 7, 9.) Also, as with\n\nmany deaf individuals, Pierce has limited lip-reading ability. (See id. ¶¶ 10–11.)\n\n       At some point prior to February of 2012, Pierce was involved in a domestic\n\ndispute with his then-partner, David Holder, after which Pierce was arrested and\n\ncharged with simple assault. (See id. ¶ 46.) On February 1, 2012, a D.C. Superior\n\nCourt Judge sentenced Pierce to 60 days in jail, and committed him to the custody of\n\nthe District of Columbia Department of Corrections (“DOC”) to serve out his sentence\n\nin the District’s Correctional Treatment Facility (“CTF”). (See id.; see also Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts, ECF No. 50, ¶ 2.) 2 Pierce was then incarcerated at CTF from February\n\n2, 2012, until March 22, 2012. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 51; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 6.)\n\nHe resided in three different units during his incarceration: Medical 96 while he was in\n\ngeneral population, and then Medical 82 and the Special Management Unit when he was\n\nplaced into protective custody. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 50; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 159–165.) Pierce was in protective custody from February 23, 2012, to March 7,\n\n2012. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 102, 112; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 164, 172.)\n\n       It is undisputed that the District’s employees and contractors were all fully aware\n\nthat Pierce is deaf. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 69; Def.’s Controverting Stmt. of Facts\n\n(“Def.’s Cont. Facts”), ECF No. 61, ¶ 69.) However, no prison staff member assessed\n\nwhether, or to what extent, Pierce would need accommodations to ensure that he could\n\ncommunicate effectively with others during his incarceration. (See Hr’g Tr., ECF No.\n\n\n2\n The DOC is an agency of the District of Columbia that, among other things, oversees operation of the\nCTF, which is a minimum and medium security correctional facility. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 13,\n17.) The DOC has contracted a private prison company (the Corrections Corporation of America) to\nrun CTF. (See id. ¶ 14.)\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\f80, at 52:3–4, 53:1–12.) Furthermore, Pierce was not provided with a qualified ASL\n\ninterpreter at any point during the entire 51-day period he spent in custody, including\n\nthe 14-day period that Pierce served in solitary confinement-like conditions.\n\n       B.     Disputed Issues\n\n       The parties vigorously disagree about how—and, more specifically, whether—\n\nPierce was actually able to communicate effectively with prison officials, health care\n\nproviders, teachers, and counselors during his incarceration. Pierce claims that he is\n\nnot skilled at reading lips when people are speaking English, nor can he skillfully\n\ninterpret notes that people have written to him in English. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.) Accordingly, Pierce asserts that he needs ASL interpretation in order\n\nto communicate effectively with people who do not know ASL. (See id. ¶ 12.) The\n\nDistrict disagrees, asserting that Pierce can communicate effectively in written English\n\nand through lip reading, primarily because Pierce appeared to understand what prison\n\nofficials said and wrote to him during his incarceration. (See Def.’s Cont. Facts ¶¶ 5, 7,\n\n8, 9; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 12–17, 28.) In the District’s view, then, exchanging\n\nwritten notes and lip reading were adequate means of effective communication for\n\nPierce while he was in custody. (See Def.’s Cont. Facts ¶¶ 8, 11, 82, 90.)\n\n       The parties also disagree about when—and whether—Pierce actually asked\n\nprison officials, health care providers, and class instructors to accommodate his hearing\n\ndisability by providing an interpreter to translate for him. Pierce claims that he\n\nrequested an interpreter at his initial medical intake interview, at inmate orientation, in\n\nhis rehabilitation classes, and at all medical appointments. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 60, 88, 98.) By contrast, the District insists that Pierce only requested a sign\n\nlanguage interpreter for certain sessions of his anger management/substance abuse\n\n\n                                             6\n\fclass. (See Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 19–21, 54, 57.) From the District’s perspective,\n\nhaving not requested an interpreter for most of the interactions that he had with prison\n\nofficials and others, Pierce is not entitled to contend that the District violated the law\n\nby failing to provide him with an interpreter for those interactions. (See Def.’s Opp’n\n\nto Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (“Def.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 60, at 1–3.) 3\n\n        These two issues—Pierce’s ability to communicate effectively in English and the\n\nextent to which he requested an ASL interpreter—lie at the heart of the parties’ cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment. As explained fully in the analysis section below, this\n\nCourt ultimately finds that these disputed issues are immaterial to the Court’s\n\nconclusion that Pierce was subjected to disability discrimination while he was in DOC\n\ncustody. (See Part III.A.1, infra.) However, for present purposes, the parties’ opposing\n\nviews regarding Pierce’s linguistic abilities and requests for accommodation provide\n\nimportant context for understanding the parties’ allegations regarding Pierce’s prison\n\nexperience. The specific disputes of fact center on whether Pierce had communication\n\ndifficulties with respect to (1) the prison facility’s medical intake and health services,\n\n(2) his inmate rehabilitation classes, (3) the protective custody procedures that were\n\nemployed in his case, and (4) the prison’s provision of telecommunications, official\n\nnotifications, and visitation. What follows is a brief summary of the parties’ conflicting\n\ndescriptions of Pierce’s custodial experience in regard to these matters.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  All citations to pages in documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the\nCourt’s electronic filing system assigns.\n\n\n\n                                                    7\n\f                1.      Pierce’s Ability To Communicate Effectively During Medical\n                        Intake And Health Processes\n\n        Immediately after Pierce was sentenced and taken into DOC custody, he was sent\n\nto the District’s Central Detention Facility for a medical screening and examination, in\n\naccordance with ordinary inmate intake procedures. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 47, 88;\n\nDef.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 8, 9.) This physical was conducted by medical professionals\n\nfrom Unity Healthcare—a private, non-profit entity that contracts with the District of\n\nColumbia to provide comprehensive health care services to inmates. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 88; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 8, 9.) The parties disagree about whether Pierce\n\nrequested, or even needed, an ASL interpreter at this initial intake evaluation and also\n\nat the many subsequent interactions that Pierce had with prison medical professionals in\n\norder to manage his significant and chronic medical conditions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶¶ 87–90; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 27–31.) 4\n\n        According to Pierce, during the initial intake process and at his subsequent\n\nmedical appointments and interventions, prison medical personnel simply assumed they\n\nwere effectively communicating with him through the exchange of written notes and\n\ngestures, despite his request for an ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 88–89,\n\n97–98, 101; see also Pl.’s Resp. to Def.’s Stmt. of Facts (“Pl.’s Cont. Facts”), ECF No.\n\n59-2, ¶¶ 28–29.) For example, Pierce claims that, at the initial intake meeting, Pierce\n\nwrote to Dr. Fidelis Doh (the doctor who conducted his intake interview) that he needed\n\nan ASL interpreter because he had complicated health issues to explain, such as HIV,\n\n\n\n4\n  Pierce has both HIV and [******]. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 87; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 40.) There\nis no dispute that, as a result of these conditions, Pierce had several medical interviews, appointments,\nand interventions while he was in custody at CTF. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 87, 97, Def.’s Stmt. of\nFacts ¶ 40.)\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\f[******], and new medications. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 88.) Dr. Doh wrote back\n\nthat they could use written communication. (See id.) Pierce continued to write that he\n\nneeded an interpreter, but the doctor did not arrange for one to be provided. (See id.)\n\nInstead, Dr. Doh simply turned his computer screen toward Pierce to show him the\n\nquestions that were written there. (See id. ¶ 89.) Pierce wrote to Dr. Doh that he could\n\nnot understand the complicated vocabulary and medical jargon on the screen, but the\n\ndoctor wrote back that Pierce should not worry about it. (See id.) Dr. Doh continued to\n\npoint at words on the screen; to ask questions orally under the assumption that Pierce\n\ncould read lips; and to write notes to Pierce throughout the initial intake process. (See\n\nid. ¶ 90.)\n\n       Pierce asserts that, as a result of Unity’s failure to provide him with an ASL\n\ninterpreter at the initial intake, he was not able to communicate the fact that, prior to his\n\nincarceration, he had been taking five prescription medications and had a history of\n\n[******]. (See id. ¶¶ 91–93.) Without this information, Unity allegedly failed to give\n\nhim any [******] medication (see id. ¶ 94), and without that medication, Pierce\n\nallegedly experienced [******] in prison (see id. ¶ 96). Pierce concedes that he\n\nultimately received treatment for this problem; however, he claims that there was no\n\nASL interpreter to help him communicate with the doctors about his symptoms or\n\nchronic condition (see id. ¶ 97), nor was he provided with an interpreter to facilitate his\n\nconversation with the doctor who treated him for a different medical crisis he\n\nsubsequently experienced (see id. ¶¶ 100–01 (claiming that Pierce suffered from\n\n[******] while he was in protective custody and that no interpreter was provided)).\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f       For its part, the District maintains that Pierce never requested an ASL interpreter\n\nfor his medical intake interview or any of his medical appointments, and this was likely\n\nso because, in the District’s view, no interpreter was necessary. (See Def.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶¶ 20, 27, 31, 35, 39.) According to the District, Dr. Doh was able to\n\ncommunicate effectively with Pierce in writing and specifically reported that Pierce\n\ncould read lips. (See id. ¶¶ 27–28.) The District admits that Dr. Doh showed Pierce the\n\nmedical intake questions on the computer screen rather than getting an interpreter to\n\ntranslate Dr. Doh’s spoken questions, but the District argues that the fact that Pierce\n\nanswered the questions through gestures and writing shows that Pierce must have\n\nunderstood the questions that he read off the screen. (See id. ¶ 30.)\n\n       The District also contends that, even if Pierce did have trouble communicating\n\nwith Dr. Doh, Pierce did not suffer any adverse consequences as a result of those\n\nalleged miscommunications. For example, the District points out that the medical\n\nprofessionals at Unity were aware of Pierce’s pre-existing conditions because Pierce\n\nsigned a written release allowing Unity to obtain Pierce’s medical history from former\n\nhealth care providers. (See id. ¶¶ 32–33.) Moreover, although Pierce was not\n\nprescribed preventative medication for [******], Pierce did receive prescription\n\n[******] medication after he [******]. (See id. ¶ 42.) Similarly, the District notes that\n\nalthough Pierce claims he was not able to communicate with his doctors about the\n\n[******], the doctor was able to develop a diagnosis ([******]) and prescribed the\n\nappropriate treatment ([******]). (See id. ¶ 44.)\n\n              2.     Pierce’s Access To Rehabilitative Classes\n\n       Pierce was enrolled in two inmate programs while at CTF: a class intended to\n\nhelp him with anger management and substance abuse issues, and a class about graphic\n\n\n                                            10\n\fdesign. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 49; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 55, 74.) The anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse course consisted of lectures, videos, and group discussion\n\nduring six or seven class sessions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 65; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶ 56.) The graphic arts class involved each inmates’ completion of computer-based\n\nmodules containing written instructions, written tests, and hands-on projects—\n\nassignments that were undertaken by the inmates individually and at their own pace,\n\nwhile a CTF employee monitored their progress and made himself or herself available\n\nto answer questions and to provide assistance. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 66; Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts ¶¶ 77–78.)\n\n       The parties disagree about the extent to which Pierce was able to understand, and\n\nbenefit from, these classes. According to Pierce, in the absence of an interpreter, he\n\nhad great difficulty following the courses; so much so that, during the first anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse group session that Pierce attended, he allegedly became\n\nincreasingly agitated and, at one point, even walked out of the session. (Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 64.) Pierce claims that, after this first session, he wrote to the instructor that he\n\nwas frustrated because he could not understand the lecture without an interpreter. (See\n\nid.) And, according to Pierce, this was one of many requests for an interpreter that he\n\nmade related to his classes; Pierce says that his partner also asked prison officials about\n\nsecuring an interpreter for Pierce for this purpose. (See id. ¶¶ 63, 68.) Pierce also\n\nmakes allegations regarding prison officials’ responses to these requests—for example,\n\nhe claims that, in response to the entreaties his partner made on his behalf, Assistant\n\nWarden Fulton eventually contacted Gallaudet University—a university for the deaf\n\nlocated in Washington, D.C.—to see if Gallaudet could provide an ASL interpreter for\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fPierce. (See id. ¶ 71.) 5 According to Pierce, when Fulton learned that Gallaudet\n\ninterpreters would need to be paid for their services, prison officials demurred, and\n\nstarted looking for other potential ways of accommodating Pierce. (See id. ¶¶ 71–72.)\n\n        Pierce asserts that, ultimately, the District neither sought, nor found, any outside\n\nASL interpreter for Pierce’s classes. (See id. ¶ 73.) Instead, near the end of his term of\n\nincarceration and after some of the sessions had been completed, a chaplain at CTF\n\nvolunteered to provide interpretive services for Pierce’s last few anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse classes. (See id. ¶ 75.) With respect to the graphics arts\n\ncourse, another inmate (Justin Clary) allegedly was asked to volunteer to sign for Pierce\n\nin approximately two or three classes (see id. ¶ 79); however, according to Pierce, Clary\n\nwas not a qualified interpreter—he just happened to be severely hard of hearing and\n\nalso happened to be enrolled in the class (see id. ¶¶ 79, 81)—and thus, Clary was not\n\nable to interpret effectively and accurately the written or oral statements that were\n\nbeing made in the class (see id. ¶ 80). 6\n\n        The District contests these representations, and maintains that Pierce\n\nsuccessfully participated in both the anger management/substance abuse program and\n\nthe graphic arts course. (See Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 68, 80.) With respect to the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse program, the District maintains that Pierce was provided\n\nwith an interpreter for all of the program sessions that took place after he requested\n\none. (See id. ¶ 57.) First, the District says, Assistant Warden Fulton employed Clary to\n\n\n5\n  The first names of CCA employees have been omitted from this Memorandum Opinion for security\nand confidentiality purposes. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts at 6 n.1.)\n6\n Pierce describes the alleged problem with Clary’s skills as an interpreter in this way: “I had to keep\nasking for clarification because I couldn’t understand what he was saying. It was not a complete\nsentence. It was just words here and there scattered about. It wasn’t anything complete. It wasn’t a\ncomplete thought. I could not understand him clearly.” (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 80.)\n\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fattend program sessions with Pierce and to interpret for him. (See id. ¶¶ 59–60.) Then,\n\nafter Pierce informed his counselor that Clary was not an adequate interpreter (see id.\n\n¶ 61), the District says that Assistant Warden Fulton contacted Gallaudet University and\n\nthe ADA Coordinator for DOC in an effort to find an interpreter for Pierce, but\n\nultimately did not have to hire an interpreter because the chaplain volunteered, and\n\ninterpreted for Pierce in four classes. (See id. ¶¶ 63–65.) The District also asserts that\n\nPierce received three days of good time credit for his participation in the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse program, and that he ultimately experienced positive\n\nbehavioral changes, including less drinking and an increased ability to control his\n\nanger. (See id. ¶¶ 68–70.)\n\n       With respect to the graphic arts vocational programming, the District insists that\n\nPierce did not request an interpreter for the program, and that an interpreter was not\n\nnecessary for him to participate in that particular program. (See id. ¶¶ 83–84.) In fact,\n\naccording to the District, Pierce’s instructor reported that he was a quick learner and\n\nhad performed better than some of the non-hearing impaired students enrolled in the\n\ncourse. (See id. ¶ 82.) The District also emphasizes that Pierce completed six modules\n\nof the graphic arts course and received six days of good time credit for his efforts. (See\n\nid. ¶¶ 80–81.)\n\n              3.     The Circumstances Surrounding Pierce’s Time In Protective\n                     Custody\n\n       Pierce spent approximately 25% of the total time he was in the custody of the\n\nDOC in solitary confinement conditions based on his alleged request for “protective\n\ncustody” after he was assaulted by another inmate. The parties have a stark\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fdisagreement about the circumstances surrounding Pierce’s entrance into protective\n\ncustody, and also how he was eventually released from that status.\n\n       Pierce maintains that, on February 23, 2012, he was shoved to the floor by\n\nanother inmate and that he reached out to Tutwiler, his assigned case manager, to\n\ncomplain about the incident. Tutwiler allegedly wrote a note to Pierce, asking him if he\n\nwould like to be placed in protective custody. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 102.) Pierce\n\ncontends that he did not understand what protective custody meant or entailed; he wrote\n\nback “If necessary.” (See id. ¶¶ 102, 104.) Pierce was then taken to Medical 82, where\n\na unit manager named Points came to Pierce’s new cell and allegedly wrote to Pierce\n\nthat Pierce needed to handwrite out “I fear for my safety” on a form Points was\n\nproviding. (See id. ¶ 105.) Pierce was confused by the request and initially refused,\n\nbut allegedly at Points’s insistence, Pierce copied that statement onto the form. (See\n\nid.)\n\n       Pierce was then placed in protective custody for fourteen days. (See id. ¶¶ 105,\n\n112.) Pierce claims that, because there was no ASL interpreter to facilitate his\n\nconversations with Tutwiler and Points, Pierce did not understand that protective\n\ncustody meant 23 hours per day of solitary confinement; that it would last for at least\n\nseven days; that it was voluntary; or that there were procedures by which he could\n\npromptly end protective custody status. (See id. ¶¶ 103–04.) According to Pierce, four\n\ndays after he was placed into protective custody, Pierce allegedly notified Allen, the\n\nFacilities Grievance Coordinator, that he had not understood what protective custody\n\nmeant. (See id. ¶ 107.) Pierce also allegedly stated his belief that his case manager\n\nshould have discussed the meaning of protective custody with him. (See id.) Allen\n\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fallegedly responded in writing: “You should have read it before you signed it.” (See\n\nid.) Pierce allegedly replied in writing, “I had no choice because they told me to sign.”\n\n(See id.)\n\n       At some point, Pierce told Griffin, another case manager, that he wanted to leave\n\nprotective custody and return to the general population. (See id. ¶ 108.) Griffin passed\n\nPierce’s request on to other staff, and on March 1, 2012, Assistant Warden Fulton\n\nlearned that Pierce wanted to leave protective custody. (See id. ¶¶ 108, 109.) Fulton\n\nwas also allegedly told that Pierce had asked to have a lawyer present before signing\n\nthe waiver form that was necessary for release back into the general population, and\n\nalthough Fulton apparently thought this was unusual, he purportedly did not ask why\n\nPierce would not sign the form despite wanting to leave protective custody. (See id.\n\n¶ 109.) Instead, Pierce alleges that Fulton advised the staff to keep Pierce in protective\n\ncustody and to review his status in one week. (See id.) Thereafter, according to Pierce,\n\nCTF employees moved Pierce to a different segregation cell, this time in the Special\n\nManagement Unit (“SMU”). (See id. ¶¶ 110–111.) Pierce felt that SMU was much\n\nworse than Medical 82; in SMU, Pierce was still on 23-hour lockdown, but he did not\n\nhave a roommate and could only see out of his cell through a small window in the metal\n\ndoor. (See id. ¶ 111.) Pierce was not released from SMU until March 7, 2012. (See id.\n\n¶ 112.)\n\n       The District has an entirely different view of the circumstances preceding\n\nPierce’s confinement in protective custody. First of all, according to the District,\n\nPoints fully explained to Pierce in writing what “protective custody” meant. (See\n\nDef.’s Cont. Facts ¶ 104.) The District claims that Points also told Pierce that, if Pierce\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\fwanted to be placed in protective custody, Pierce would need to write on the protective\n\ncustody request form why Pierce wanted to be placed in protective custody. (See id.\n\n¶ 105.) Pierce then allegedly voluntarily wrote out on the form, “I fear for my safety.\n\nHIV +” and signed it. (See id.) Thus, the District maintains that Points did not require\n\nPierce to write on the form at all, much less to make any specific statement. (See id.)\n\n      The District also claims that, once Pierce filled out the protective custody\n\nrequest form, Assistant Warden Fulton was prohibited from removing Pierce from\n\nprotective custody status until Pierce signed a protective custody waiver indicating that\n\nPierce no longer feared for his safety. (See id. ¶ 109.) According to the District, Pierce\n\nknew that he needed to sign the waiver if he wanted to be removed from protective\n\ncustody, but Pierce refused to sign the waiver form anyway. (See id.) Moreover, the\n\nDistrict claims that, per CTF policy, inmates in protective custody are subject to review\n\nevery seven days and thus Fulton’s direction to the staff to review Pierce’s status in\n\nseven days was in accordance with facility policy. (See id.) The District also contends\n\nthat Pierce was confined under the same conditions in both Medical 82 and the Special\n\nManagement Unit. (See id. ¶ 111.)\n\n             4.     Deaf Inmates’ Rights To Telecommunications, Official\n                    Notifications, And Visitation\n\n      Finally, and not surprisingly, the parties tell completely different stories\n\nregarding certain privileges that inmates ordinarily receive at CTF and the extent to\n\nwhich deaf inmates such as Pierce are afforded equal access to them.\n\n      For example, according to Pierce, hearing inmates in the general population in\n\nthe prison’s medical unit have access to telephones seven days a week, are permitted to\n\nuse the telephone for 10 minutes at a time, and do not need to request permission in\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fadvance to use the telephones. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 114.) Pierce, on the other\n\nhand, allegedly had much more limited access to telecommunications, even apart from\n\nthe fact that CTF provides deaf inmates with an outmoded TTY device instead of a\n\nmodern videophone. 7 Pierce claims that his access to the TTY device varied depending\n\non where he was housed because, in order for him to place a call, DOC officials\n\nrequired him to make an appointment in advance to use the TTY, which was available\n\nonly in his case manager’s office. (See id. ¶¶ 115, 124.) Moreover, according to\n\nPierce, prison officials demanded the presence of his case manager or another CTF\n\nemployee while he was using the TTY device. (See id. ¶ 124.) Pierce alleges that his\n\ncase manager’s hours were typically only Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to\n\n5:00 p.m., which substantially restricted his TTY usage window, and even when his\n\ncase manager was on duty, she allegedly would only grant Pierce’s requests to use the\n\nTTY machine at her convenience. (See id. ¶¶ 124–25.) Pierce also alleges that his calls\n\nwere strictly limited to 10 minutes, even though communicating using a TTY device\n\ntakes substantially more time than communicating using a telephone. (See id. ¶ 126.) 8\n\n\n7\n  A TTY consists of a keyboard, display screen, and telephone. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 116.) Typed\nmessages from each party are sent over the telephone lines and appear on the screen of the other (see\nid. ¶ 116), and thus both parties must have a TTY to have a direct conversation (see id. ¶ 118). Indirect\nconversations are also possible, if the telephone company provides relay services, which involve\ncommunicating through the assistance of a third-party telephone operator, who reads aloud words typed\nby the deaf party and types out the spoken responses of the hearing person. (See id. ¶ 117) Two deaf\nindividuals cannot communicate via TTY unless both parties have a TTY device and can type in\nEnglish effectively. (See id. ¶ 118).\n Pierce avers that, like many other deaf individuals, he uses a videophone in the outside world. (See id.\n¶ 8.) A videophone uses high-speed internet to enable real-time video communication so that deaf\nindividuals can communicate with one another in ASL. (See id. ¶ 57). Videophones also enable\ncommunication between deaf and hearing individuals through the use of a video relay service (“VRS”).\nVRS is a system by which a deaf individual signs via video monitor to a remote sign language\ninterpreter, and the interpreter communicates the deaf person’s message to the hearing individual in\nspoken English and vice versa. (See id. ¶ 58.) VRS is free to all users and has been widely available\nsince at least the mid-2000s. (See id. ¶ 59.)\n8\n In this same vein, Pierce contends that hearing inmates who were in protective custody in the Medical\n82 unit and the SMU could ask to have a telephone brought to their cell during the day by asking the\n\n\n                                                   17\n\f        In response to Pierce’s accusations regarding his unequal access to\n\ntelecommunications, the District maintains that Pierce was provided access to the TTY\n\ndevice when he requested it (see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 110), and that he did not\n\nrequest use of a videophone while at CTF (id. ¶ 22). Furthermore, the District contends\n\nthat the TTY device must be kept in the case manager’s office “for security reasons”\n\n(id. ¶ 112), and that the practical differences between using a TTY device and using a\n\ntelephone justify the different access policies that apply to hearing and hearing-disabled\n\ninmates. (See, e.g., id. ¶ 115 (“The TTY device cannot be left unsecured in the housing\n\nunit, where it could pose a security risk or become contraband.”); id. ¶ 116 (“CTF staff\n\nmust be present during TTY calls, which are not subject to security monitoring and\n\nrecording like the regular inmate telephones.”).)\n\n        Pierce alleges that inequities also exist with respect to both the visitation\n\nprocesses that are afforded to deaf inmates at CTF and the official notification\n\nannouncements that CTF staff make. Regarding visitation, Pierce claims that he was\n\nhandcuffed during at least one visit from his partner and his mother (see Pl.’s Stmt. of\n\nFacts ¶ 137), which is problematic because Pierce communicates with his mother using\n\nASL and needs to have his hands free in order to speak. The District responds that\n\nPierce did not request any accommodations with respect to visitation while he was at\n\nCTF (see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 150), and that it is standard CTF policy that all\n\ninmates in protective custody be restrained when they are outside their cells. (See id.\n\n\n\nofficer on the unit. (See id. ¶ 127.) By contrast, deaf and hard of hearing inmates had to request to use\na TTY in the case manager’s office, which allegedly involved writing a request to use a TTY in the\noffice and giving it to an officer during that officer’s daily walkthrough. (See id. ¶¶ 128, 131.) If the\nrequest was granted, the inmate would be brought to the office in handcuffs and would be permitted to\nuse the TTY device, still in handcuffs. (See id.)\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\f¶ 139.) 9 Thus, the District claims that it was merely following policy when Pierce was\n\nrestrained during a visit with his mother and Holder. (See id. ¶ 148.) The District also\n\npoints out (and Pierce concedes) that an exception was made in Pierce’s case, and that\n\nhis handcuffs were removed once Pierce’s mother explained the problem to CTF\n\nauthorities.\n\n        Pierce’s alleged concern about official notifications remained unresolved,\n\nhowever. Pierce asserts that, because there was no visual alarm to alert him to\n\nannouncements or to notify him of an emergency lockdown, fire, or other emergency\n\nwhen his cell door was closed, he was constantly anxious and worried about missing\n\nimportant information. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 134–135.) The District contends\n\nthat Pierce’s anxiety was unfounded, because each housing unit at CTF has alarms in\n\nthe hallways consisting of a very loud alarm and strobe lights that are visible from\n\ninside each of the cells, including the cells that Pierce occupied during his incarceration\n\nat CTF. (Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 123–24.) Furthermore, with respect to Pierce’s claim\n\nthat he was not provided access to a visual alarm for other notifications, the District\n\nclaims that CTF does not use a loud speaker or other type of auditory system for\n\nmaking notifications or announcements to inmates (see id. ¶ 129), and that, instead,\n\nwritten notifications and announcements are posted on the bulletin boards in the\n\nhousing units, which are accessible to all inmates when they are out of their cells. (See\n\nid. ¶ 127.)\n\n\n\n\n9\n  According to Defendants, this policy applies to all “status inmates,” a category that includes inmates\nin protective custody, administrative segregation, and disciplinary segregation. (See Def.’s Stmt. of\nFacts ¶ 140.)\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\f       C.     Procedural History\n\n       On February 1, 2013—exactly one year after Pierce was first committed to the\n\ncustody of the DOC—Pierce filed the instant three-count complaint against the District.\n\n(See Compl., ECF No. 1.) Claims I and II of Pierce’s complaint allege that the District\n\n“intentionally” discriminated against Pierce in violation of Title II of the ADA and\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act “by failing to provide Mr. Pierce adequate access\n\nto a qualified ASL interpreter, telecommunications devices, visual alarms[,] and\n\nvisitation.” (Id. ¶ 49 (Claim I, Title II of the ADA); id. ¶ 50 (Claim II, Section 504 of\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act).) In Claim III, Pierce alleges that the District also violated the\n\nADA and the Rehabilitation Act by “retailat[ing] against [him] for asserting his rights”\n\nunder those statutes. (See id. ¶ 51.) After the parties engaged in discovery and\n\nattempted to resolve the case through mediation (see Order Referring Case for\n\nMediation, ECF No. 40), Pierce filed a motion for summary judgment as to Claims I\n\nand II of his complaint (see Pl.’s Mot. for Partial Summ. J. as to Claims I and II of the\n\nCompl., ECF No. 47).\n\n       Pierce argues that he is entitled to summary judgment on Claims I and II because\n\nthe District violated Title II and Section 504 by (1) failing to provide Pierce with a\n\nqualified ASL interpreter for his rehabilitation classes, medical treatment, and the\n\ngrievance process (see Pl.’s Mem. in Supp. of Pl.’s Mot (“Pl.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 48-2 at\n\n18–32); (2) providing a TTY machine to Pierce to make phone calls rather than a\n\nvideophone and limiting the times at which and duration for which Pierce could make\n\nphone calls (see id. at 32–35); (3) not providing a visual or tactile alarm to Pierce for\n\nboth routine and emergency notifications (see id. at 35–36); and (4) handcuffing Pierce\n\nduring a visit with his mother and partner (see id. at 36). Pierce asserts that he did not\n\n\n                                            20\n\fmove for summary judgment with respect to Claim III of his complaint because there is\n\na material factual dispute regarding whether he was placed in protective custody\n\nbecause he requested accommodations for his disability. (See Pl.’s Mem. in Opp’n to\n\nDef.’s Mot. (“Pl.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 59-1, at 45–48.)\n\n       The District has not only opposed Pierce’s motion for summary judgment (see\n\nDef.’s Opp’n to Pl.’s Mot. (“Def.’s Opp’n”), ECF No. 60), it has also filed one of its\n\nown (see Def.’s Mot. for Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mot.”), ECF No. 49). The District contends\n\nthat it is entitled to summary judgment on Claims I and II because, in the District’s\n\nview, the only accommodations that Pierce requested during his time at CTF were an\n\ninterpreter for his anger management/substance abuse class, the use of a TTY device,\n\nand to be un-cuffed during his visit with his mother and partner—accommodations that\n\nthe District says it readily provided. (See Def.’s Mot. at 7–16.) To the extent that\n\nPierce argues that the District should have accommodated him by providing an ASL\n\ninterpreter at other times, the District contends that it cannot be held liable for its\n\nfailure to provide accommodations that were not requested. (See id. at 5, 6, 16, 21.)\n\nThe District also argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Pierce’s retaliation\n\nclaim (Claim III) because, in the District’s view, the prison staff did not take any\n\nadverse action against Pierce as a result of his requests for accommodation. (See id. at\n\n17–18.)\n\n       This Court held a hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment\n\non April 23, 2015. (See Minute Entry for Proceedings dated Apr. 23, 2015.)\n\n\n\n\n                                             21\n\fII.    LEGAL STANDARDS\n\n       A.

Participants in this civil rights movement insisted that society\n\nrecognize disabled people not as “unfortunate, afflicted creatures” but as “equal\n\ncitizens, individually varying across the spectrum of human abilities, whose over-riding\n\n\n\n\n                                            24\n\fneeds are freedom from discrimination and a fair chance to participate fully in society.”\n\nId. at 426–27.\n\n        With respect to the programs, services, and activities that are provided by, or\n\nfunded through, government entities, Congress responded by enacting legislation “to\n\nprovide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of\n\ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities” as well as “strong, consistent,\n\nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities.”\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1)–(2) (2012); see also 29 U.S.C. § 701(a)(5) (2012)\n\n(acknowledging that “individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms\n\nof discrimination in . . . critical areas” of life). To this end, Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act specifically states that “[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a\n\ndisability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\n\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance[.]”\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a).

Second, the\nstatutes have different causation requirements. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that “[n]o\n\n\n                                                   25\n\f        Significantly for present purposes, because Congress was concerned that\n\n“[d]iscrimination against the handicapped was . . . most often the product, not of\n\ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference—of benign neglect[,]”\n\nAlexander v.

That\n\nis, an entity that provides services to the public cannot stand idly by while people with\n\ndisabilities attempt to utilize programs and services designed for the able-bodied;\n\ninstead, to satisfy Section 504 and Title II, such entities may very well need to act\n\naffirmatively to modify, supplement, or tailor their programs and services to make them\n\naccessible to persons with disabilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) (requiring entities that\n\nprovide services to the public to (1) make “reasonable modifications to rules, policies,\n\nor practices”; (2) “remov[e] . . . architectural, communication, or transportation\n\nbarriers”; and (3) “provi[de] auxiliary aids and services” so as to enable disabled\n\npersons to participate in programs or activities). Moreover, these modifications—called\n\n“accommodations” in Section 504 and Title II parlance—must be sufficient to provide a\n\ndisabled person with an “equal opportunity to obtain the same result, to gain the same\n\nbenefit, or to reach the same level of achievement” as a person who is not disabled.\n\nAlexander, 469 U.S. at 305 (quoting regulations implementing Section 504 (internal\n\n\n\n\notherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or\nhis disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. . . .” 29 U.S.C. §\n794(a) (emphasis added).

Neither of these differences are relevant to the claims in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                     26\n\fquotation marks omitted)); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(ii) (2014) (stating that a\n\npublic entity discriminates in violation of Title II if qualified individuals with\n\ndisabilities are given an “opportunity to participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit,\n\nor service that is not equal to that afforded others”).\n\n\nIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n       As explained fully below, this Court will grant Pierce’s motion for summary\n\njudgment with respect to his Section 504 and Title II discrimination claims (Claims I\n\nand II of his complaint) and will deny the District’s motion for summary judgment in its\n\nentirety. The Court reaches this conclusion because it finds that the District violated\n\nSection 504 and Title II as a matter of law when it failed to evaluate Pierce’s need for\n\naccommodation at the time he was taken into custody. (This legal conclusion is entirely\n\nindependent of the hotly disputed issues regarding whether or not Pierce was, in fact,\n\nable to communicate effectively with prison officials, and whether or not Pierce did, in\n\nfact, request an ASL interpreter for his interactions while in custody; however, as\n\ndiscussed below, the Court finds that no reasonable jury could agree with the District\n\non these issues, and thus, the District violated Section 504 and Title II on this basis as\n\nwell.) The Court also finds that, because the District’s failure to evaluate Pierce’s\n\nneeds amounted to deliberate indifference to Pierce’s rights and the District’s\n\nobligations under Section 504 and Title II, the District’s conduct constituted intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and thus, Pierce is entitled to compensatory damages for the mental,\n\nemotional, and physical injuries he sustained. However, with respect to Pierce’s\n\nretaliation claim, the Court concludes that there are genuine issues of material fact that\n\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\fstill need to be resolved; consequently, the District’s motion for summary judgment on\n\nthe retaliation claim must be denied.\n\n        A.

(See, e.g., Pl.’s Mot. at 26 (“Without\n\na qualified interpreter in any of his graphics arts classes, and without an interpreter in\n\nall but his last three or four anger management/substance abuse classes, Mr. Pierce was\n\nclearly denied meaningful access to these programs and was unable to derive any of the\n\nbenefits from them.”); Def.’s Opp’n at 11 (“Pierce did not request an interpreter for his\n\nmedical intake and appointments, [and] his providers were able to communicate with\n\nhim in writing.”).) However, there is an undisputed threshold fact that, in this Court’s\n\nview, so clearly establishes intentional discrimination in violation of Section 504 and\n\nTitle II that summary judgment must be issued in Pierce’s favor notwithstanding the\n\nfactual disputes over Pierce’s actual requests and needs: the District took Pierce—an\n\nobviously disabled inmate—into custody without undertaking any ex ante evaluation of\n\nhis accommodation requirements, and when he later requested aid, either rebuffed his\n\ninquiries entirely or provided him with whatever auxiliary tools it had on hand. As\n\nexplained below, this Court holds that the failure of prison staff to conduct an informed\n\nassessment of the abilities and accommodation needs of a new inmate who is obviously\n\n\n\n\n486 (7th Cir. 1997) abrogated on other grounds by Erickson v.

Moreover, the Court concludes that even if\n\nthe District is correct to contend that the Section 504 and Title II duty to provide\n\naccommodations for disabled inmates is triggered only if the inmate requests and\n\nultimately needs accommodation, no reasonable jury could find that Pierce failed to\n\nrequest an ASL interpreter, or that he could communicate effectively without one, on\n\nthe record presented here.\n\n              1.     The District Had An Affirmative Duty To Evaluate Pierce’s\n                     Accommodation Requirements, And Its Failure To Do So\n                     Constituted Disability Discrimination As A Matter Of Law\n\n       It is clear beyond cavil that the core principle that underlies the protections of\n\nSection 504 and Title II is equal access. As explained above, Congress has required\n\nentities to provide reasonable accommodations that would permit disabled individuals\n\nto access programs and services in addition to prohibiting discriminatory animus, see\n\nAlexander v. Choate, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111299\"><a href=\"/opinion/111299/alexander-v-choate/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (1985), and the regulatory scheme that\n\nundergirds the anti-discrimination statutes reinforces this reasonable accommodations\n\nmandate. Thus, without regard to whether persons with disabilities who seek the\n\nbenefit of public services have requested accommodation, a public entity that is covered\n\nby Title II must “operate each service, program, or activity so that the service, program,\n\nor activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by, people\n\nwith disabilities[,]” 28 C.F.R. § 35.150 (2014), and to satisfy Section 504, recipients of\n\nfederal funding “shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids to qualified handicapped\n\npersons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills where a refusal to make such\n\nprovision would discriminatorily impair or exclude the participation of such persons in\n\na program or activities receiving Federal financial assistance[,]” 28 C.F.R. § 42.503(f).\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       Given Congress’s unmistakable intent to create “clear, strong, consistent, [and]\n\nenforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities” in\n\nvarious aspects of life, 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(2), and also its recognition that “benign\n\nneglect” is a particularly pernicious form of disability discrimination, Alexander, 469\n\nU.S. at 295, the District’s insistence here that prison officials have no legal obligation\n\nto provide accommodations for disabled inmates unless the inmate specifically requests\n\nsuch aid—and even then, only if it actually turns out that the inmate really needs the\n\nrequested accommodation—is untenable and cannot be countenanced. First of all,\n\nnothing in the disability discrimination statutes even remotely suggests that covered\n\nentities have the option of being passive in their approach to disabled individuals as far\n\nas the provision of accommodations is concerned. Quite to the contrary, as explained\n\nabove, Section 504 and Title II mandate that entities act affirmatively to evaluate the\n\nprograms and services they offer and to ensure that people with disabilities will have\n\nmeaningful access to those services. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); 28 C.F.R. §\n\n35.150(a); 28 C.F.R. § 35.150. This affirmative duty is seemingly at its apex in the\n\ncontext of a prison facility, in light of the uneven power dynamic between prison\n\nofficials and inmates that inherently and appropriately exists, and also the fact that\n\ndepartments of corrections have complete control over whether prison inmates (disabled\n\nor not) receive any programs or services at all.

Put another way, given that Section 504 and Title II require all\n\nentities that provide public services to act affirmatively to ensure that disabled\n\nindividuals have meaningful access, prisons seemingly have even more responsibility in\n\nthis regard, because inmates necessarily rely totally upon corrections departments for\n\nall of their needs while in custody and do not have the freedom to obtain such services\n\n(or the accommodations that permit them to access those services) elsewhere.\n\n       What is more, the District’s suggestion that a prison facility need not act to\n\naccommodate an obviously disabled inmate if the inmate does not ask for\n\naccommodations (see Def.’s Mot. at 5) is truly baffling as a matter of law and logic.\n\nThe District does not explain how inmates with known communications-related\n\ndifficulties (such as Pierce) are supposed to communicate a need for accommodations,\n\nor, for that matter, why the protections of Section 504 and Title II should be construed\n\nto be unavailable to such disabled persons unless they somehow manage to overcome\n\ntheir communications-related disability sufficiently enough to convey their need for\n\naccommodations effectively. The implications of the District’s analysis are troubling,\n\nand they sweep broadly—by the District’s reasoning, it would appear that only a\n\nspecific request for a wheelchair would trigger any duty to accommodate an inmate who\n\ncannot walk, and a blind inmate would need to make a specific request for a cane or a\n\nguide if he desired to move about the prison grounds; meanwhile, prison officials could\n\nsit idly by, taking no affirmative steps to accommodate such disabled prisoners and\n\nexpecting to be able to wield the inmate’s failure to request accommodation like some\n\nsort of talisman that wards off Section 504 and Title II liability in any future legal\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\faction. This imagined state of affairs is unquestionably inconsistent with the text and\n\npurpose of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, which means that the District must now\n\nface a stark reality: no matter how fervently it holds the belief that a public entity’s\n\nduty to provide accommodations arises only by request, there is neither legal nor logical\n\nsupport for that proposition.\n\n       To be sure, there are times in which courts have held that a disabled person must\n\nrequest accommodation. See, e.g., Flemmings v. Howard Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185038\"><a href=\"/opinion/185038/flemmings-virginia-v-howard-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 858,\n\n861–62 (D.C.

But it is equally\n\nclear that the legal significance of the request requirement is merely to put the entity on\n\nnotice that the person is disabled; it does not serve as a means of shifting the burden of\n\ninitiating the accommodations process to the disabled individual.

It is well-\n\nestablished (albeit in the employment context) that it violates the ADA if an employer\n\nwith a duty to provide reasonable accommodations responds to the known disabled\n\ncondition of an employee by giving that employee whatever aids the employer alone\n\nthinks might do the trick, without any actual assessment of the employee’s individual\n\ncondition or needs in consultation with the employee.

(See D.C. Dep’t of Corr., Program\n\nStatement 3800.3, Ex. 9 to Rocap Decl., ECF No. 48-5, at 92, § 12(a)(2); see also id.\n\n§ 12(b)(2) (stating that the “DOC shall honor the [inmate’s] expressed choice”\n\nregarding accommodations unless, inter alia, “it can show that another equally effective\n\nmeans of communication is available”).) Nevertheless, the District here resists the\n\nconclusion that the law required CTF’s employees and contractors to take affirmative\n\nsteps up front to evaluate Pierce’s needs in order to identify which accommodations\n\nwould be appropriate for him. Instead, by insisting that the accommodations process\n\nthat was employed in the instant case is consistent with Section 504 and Title II, the\n\nDistrict suggests that the law permits corrections staff to treat the reasonable\n\naccommodations mandate much like a game of chance--i.e., on the one hand, prison\n\nstaff can play it safe by undertaking an ex ante assessment of the actual needs of a\n\ndisabled inmate in their custody, or on the other, they can opt to forgo that expense, and\n\nif accommodations are requested, provide a hodgepodge of whatever aids are in the\n\nprison’s possession, thereby betting either that the inmate will remain silent or that he\n\n\n\n\n                                            35\n\fultimately will be found to have needed no more than the auxiliary aids that the\n\ncorrections facility randomly provided. There will, of course, be times when\n\ncorrections staff will take that bet and get it right. Cf. Charles Clay Doyle et al.,\n\nDictionary of Modern Proverbs 287 (2012) (noting that even a broken clock gets the\n\ntime right twice a day). But to the extent that the District contends that Section 504 and\n\nTitle II permit public entities to engage in this sort of gamble with respect to the\n\naccommodation needs of disabled individuals whom they are required to serve, it is\n\nsorely mistaken. See 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2); see also 28 C.F.R. § 35.160(b)(2)\n\n(indicating that a public entity has a duty to “determin[e] what types of auxiliary aids\n\nand services are necessary” for the disabled individuals it serves).\n\n        The bottom line is this: this Court squarely rejects the legal position that the\n\nDistrict seeks to advance in this action, which is, in essence, that the DOC acts\n\nconsistently with Section 504 and Title II when it takes custody of an obviously\n\ndisabled prisoner without undertaking any evaluation of that inmate’s needs and the\n\naccommodations that will be necessary to ensure that he or she has meaningful access\n\nto prison services, and instead, provides a random assortment of auxiliary aids upon\n\nrequest and at various times based primarily on considerations of its own convenience. 12\n\nQuite to the contrary, based on its reading of federal law, this Court holds that prison\n\nofficials have an affirmative duty to assess the potential accommodation needs of\n\ninmates with known disabilities who are taken into custody and to provide the\n\n\n\n12\n   With respect to hearing-disabled inmates in particular, it appears that the District of Columbia’s DOC\nis not the only prison system that engages in this sort of practice. See, e.g., Matt Zapotosky, Justice\nDept. Looking into Treatment of Deaf Inmates in Arlington Jail, Washington Post, July 29, 2015,\navailable at: http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/crime/justice-dept-looking-into-treatment-of-deaf-\ninmates-in-arlington-jail/2015/07/29/ae910412-360a-11e5-b673-1df005a0fb28_story.html.\n\n\n\n                                                   36\n\faccommodations that are necessary for those inmates to access the prison’s programs\n\nand services, without regard to whether or not the disabled individual has made a\n\nspecific request for accommodation and without relying solely on the assumptions of\n\nprison officials regarding that individual’s needs. And because it is undisputed that the\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors did no such thing when Pierce arrived at CTF, this\n\nCourt finds that the District violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II\n\nof the Americans with Disabilities Act as a matter of law.\n\n              2.     Even If The District Is Only Legally Required To Provide Inmates\n                     With Accommodations That Are Both Requested And Ultimately\n                     Needed, There Is No Genuine Dispute That Pierce Requested The\n                     Assistance Of An ASL Interpreter Or That He Needed One\n\n       Having already determined that the District committed a violation of Section 504\n\nand Title II as a matter of law when it failed to evaluate Pierce’s accommodation needs\n\nat the time he was taken into custody, the Court pauses here (prior to turning to the\n\nmatter of damages) to address the myriad factual disputes that arise under the District’s\n\nview of its legal obligations. The District maintains that its legal obligation to\n\naccommodate Pierce depended on three things: (1) whether Pierce requested an\n\naccommodation, (2) whether the requested accommodation was necessary, and (3)\n\nwhether the requested accommodation could be provided. (See Hr’g Tr. at 52:18, 53:7–\n\n12; see also, e.g., Def.’s Mot. at 5 (“An entity cannot be held liable for failure to\n\nprovide accommodations that were not requested.”); Def.’s Opp’n at 1–2 (“Pierce’s\n\nMotion focuses largely on what accommodations may be possible for a hearing\n\nimpaired inmate in a correctional setting, rather than on what accommodations were\n\nactually requested and necessary for Pierce to participate in the available programs and\n\nactivities while he was incarcerated at [CTF].”) (emphasis in original).) As mentioned,\n\n\n\n                                             37\n\fthe Court’s legal analysis renders the parties’ various arguments regarding whether and\n\nto what extent Pierce actually requested an interpreter and actually could communicate\n\nin English immaterial to the Court’s conclusion that Pierce is entitled to summary\n\njudgment on Claims I and II. (See supra Part III.A.1.) However, as explained below,\n\nthis Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude on the record presented here that\n\nPierce failed to request an ASL interpreter to assist him while he was detained at CTF,\n\nor that Pierce could communicate effectively without an interpreter, and thus Pierce\n\nwould be entitled to summary judgment on his discrimination claims even if the law is\n\nas the District says it is.\n\n                      a.      The Record Establishes That Pierce Requested An\n                              Interpreter\n\n       The instant record is replete with specific references to Pierce’s multiple\n\nrequests for an ASL interpreter in various contexts during his time at CTF. (See, e.g.,\n\nPierce Dep. 427:12–20, Feb. 25, 2014, Ex. 2 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 34.)\n\nDeposition testimony from the District’s own employees confirms that Pierce\n\nrepeatedly asked for an interpreter. (See, e.g., Tutwiler Dep. 63:4–19, Sept. 9, 2013,\n\nEx. 16 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6, at 10 (Case Manager Tutwiler admitting that Pierce\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter); Allen Dep. 48:16–22, Sept. 10, 2013, Ex. 17 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 26 (Facilities Grievance Coordinator Allen stating that Pierce\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter); McNeal Dep. 31:14–32:3, Sept. 11, 2013, Ex. 19 To\n\nPl.’s Mot, ECF No. 48-6, at 47–48 (Counselor McNeal remarking that Pierce requested\n\nan ASL interpreter).) And the accounts of various eyewitness are not the only proof:\n\ncontemporaneous log book entries, handwritten notes, and memoranda all document\n\nPierce’s persistent efforts to seek and obtain an ASL interpreter from the authorities at\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\fCTF. (See, e.g., Feb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No.\n\n48-6, at 216; Mar. 6, 2012 Memorandum from P. McNeal to W. Fulton, Ex. 34 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 219; CCA logbook entries, Ex. 35 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6,\n\nat 221.)\n\n       Most notably in this regard, the record contains a revealing set of handwritten\n\nnotes between Pierce and his case manager (Tutwiler) in which Pierce writes: “They\n\nviolate my rights here – Thire [sic] was no interpreter for inmate program, Hall\n\nmeeting, or orientation process. I feel I [sic] abandoned. ADA law says there’s a must\n\n[sic] for everyone to access equal!” (See Ex. 36 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 47-6, at 224\n\n(emphasis in original).) To which Tutwiler replies, “[a]s long as we are able to\n\ncommunicate through writing, your rights have not been violated.” (See id.) And\n\nPierce responds, “My writing is not good[;] I feel our communication is vey[sic]\n\nlimited. That’s why I want an interpreter so it could [sic] prevent our misunderstand\n\n[sic]. I want to fully understand what all of you say.” Pierce continues, “It’s not fair[;]\n\neveryone understands whats’[sic] going on here, I dont’[sic] understand at all [sic]\n\nsince I got here.” (See id.)\n\n       Given this telling paper trail and the confirmatory statements of witnesses, this\n\nCourt finds that the District’s suggestion here that Pierce did not, in fact, request an\n\nASL interpreter to assist him while he was incarcerated (see Def.’s Opp’n at 1–2) is\n\npreposterous. Perhaps to avoid losing all credibility with respect to this issue, the\n\nDistrict has also offered a more limited representation: that Pierce’s repeated requests\n\nfor an ASL interpreter were limited to his anger management/substance abuse class, and\n\nthat he did not specifically request an interpreter with respect to any other service or\n\n\n\n\n                                             39\n\fprogram at CTF. (See Def.’s Reply at 5 (“Pierce only requested an interpreter for one\n\nsetting—his anger management and substance abuse programming—and failed to put\n\nthe District (or its contractors) on notice that he believed he needed an interpreter for\n\nany other type of program or activity.”) (emphasis in original); see also, e.g., Def.’s\n\nStmt. of Facts ¶ 24 (“Pierce submitted informal resolutions and grievances requesting\n\nan interpreter for anger management and substance abuse programming.”); Def.’s Cont.\n\nFacts ¶ 60 (“The District does not dispute that Pierce made multiple requests for an\n\ninterpreter for the anger management and substance abuse program while he was at\n\nCTF.”); Def.’s Reply at 5 (“Corrections staff reasonably believed on the basis of his\n\nrequests that Pierce felt an interpreter was necessary for him to participate in the anger\n\nmanagement and substance abuse program, but not for other programming, activities, or\n\nevents for which he did not request an interpreter.”). ) Contrary to the District’s\n\ninterpretation of the facts, the record clearly establishes that Pierce made so many\n\nrequests for an ASL interpreter at so many different times that his case manager\n\nactually told him to stop. (See Feb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 48-6, at 216 (Pierce stating “I already requested Ms Tutwlier to find an\n\ninterpreter and she said, stop requesting and forwarded to Mr Fulton.”).) And it is also\n\nclear from the record evidence that Pierce’s requests were not limited to the anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse class at all, and in fact, Pierce wanted an interpreter to\n\nhelp him understand most (if not all) of the various conversations that he had with the\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors. For example, on an informal resolution form\n\ndated February 27, 2012, Pierce writes about how CTF had not yet provided him with\n\nan interpreter for his anger management/substance abuse class, and he closes by stating,\n\n\n\n\n                                            40\n\f“[p]lease bring an interpreter for our meeting, because the case is very serious.” (See\n\nFeb 27, 2012 Informal Resolution Form, Ex. 33 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-6, at 216.)\n\n       But even if the District was factually correct to assert that Pierce’s request for an\n\ninterpreter extended only to his anger management/substance abuse class, there is no\n\nlegal basis for the District’s related suggestion that Pierce needed to request an\n\ninterpreter with respect to each and every aspect of his prison experience in order to\n\ngive rise to any duty on the part of prison employees to provide that accommodation for\n\nPierce in regard to other significant aspects of his imprisonment. The Eighth Circuit\n\ncase of Randolph v. Rodgers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762471\"><a href=\"/opinion/762471/ronnie-randolph-v-bill-rodgers-don-roper-paul-delo-michael-bowersox/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1999), supports this conclusion.\n\nThere, an inmate who was deaf alleged that the Missouri Department of Corrections\n\n(“MDOC”) had violated Title II of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and\n\nMissouri state law when it failed to provide him with a sign language interpreter during\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. Randolph, 170 F.3d at 853–54. The Randolph court found\n\nthat, while the inmate had not requested an interpreter for his initial disciplinary\n\nproceeding, his subsequent request was sufficient to put the MDOC “on notice” of his\n\nclaim that he could not fully participate in future proceedings without an interpreter,\n\nand thus the MDOC could not be heard to contend that the request for an interpreter\n\nwas limited in scope. Id. at 858. This was especially so because the MDOC had told\n\nthe inmate that his request for an interpreter “is a separate subject [that] will not be\n\ndiscussed[,]’” and thus, it was entirely unsurprising that the prisoner did not request an\n\ninterpreter for subsequent disciplinary proceedings. Id. The Randolph court concluded\n\nthat: “While it is true that public entities are not required to guess at what\n\naccommodations they should provide, the [request] requirement does not narrow the\n\n\n\n\n                                             41\n\fADA or [Rehabilitation Act] so much that the [MDOC] may claim that [the inmate]\n\nfailed to request an accommodation when it declined to discuss the issue with him.” Id.\n\nat 858–59.\n\n       So it is here. The record shows that Pierce made repeated requests for an ASL\n\ninterpreter with respect to various aspects of his incarceration experience, and that\n\nDistrict’s employees and contractors generally declined to discuss the matter further,\n\npreferring to rely on lip reading and handwritten notes. Moreover, as the District\n\nconcedes, Pierce did request an interpreter for the purpose of his anger\n\nmanagement/substance abuse class (see Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 61; see also id. ¶ 62\n\n(Pierce represented on one informal resolution form that he “wrote about 8 request\n\nforms” for an interpreter); therefore, even assuming that a specific request for\n\naccommodation was legally required in order for prison officials to have any obligation\n\nto accommodate Pierce, the undisputed facts establish that Pierce did make such a\n\nrequest, and under Randolph, his request was sufficient to put DOC “on notice” that he\n\nmight need a similar accommodation to communicate effectively in other contexts as\n\nwell. Thus, this Court finds that no reasonable jury could conclude on this record that\n\nPierce had failed to mount the request hurdle (assuming there is one), and as a result, no\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact remains with respect to whether or not Pierce made an\n\nadequate request for an interpreter, even under the District’s view of the applicable\n\ndiscrimination standard.\n\n                     b.     The Record Shows That Pierce Needed An Interpreter\n\n       The record here also clearly establishes that Pierce cannot communicate\n\neffectively in English, and thus no reasonable jury could find otherwise. It is\n\nundisputed that Pierce is profoundly deaf and that he ordinarily communicates through\n\n\n                                            42\n\fASL. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 1, 3; Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 1.) ASL is not derived\n\nfrom English; ASL has its own syntax and grammar and utilizes signs made by hand\n\nmotions, facial expressions, eye gazes, and body postures. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 4;\n\nDef.’s Cont. Facts ¶ 4.) Therefore, the vast majority of deaf people—Pierce included—\n\nlack the ability to communicate effectively in English, whether by writing notes or\n\nreading lips. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 5, 7, 10; see also Expert Report of Prof.\n\nBienvenu, Ex. 3 to Pl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 104 (expert in Deaf culture, literacy,\n\nand ASL assessment concluding that “[b]oth my personal interaction with Pierce and\n\nthe case-related documents I reviewed to prepare this report lead me to strongly believe\n\nthat Pierce, at a minimum, requires both quality ASL interpretation services and\n\nvideophone telecommunications technology to effectively communicate with others”\n\n(emphasis in original)).) 13\n\n        Despite this evidence, the District asserts that Pierce actually can communicate\n\neffectively in English, through both written notes and lip reading. See 28 C.F.R. part\n\n\n13\n  Pierce has offered the testimony of two experts—Martina Bienvenu and Richard Ray—both of whom\nthe District has moved to exclude. (See Def.’s Mot. to Preclude Pl.’s Experts, ECF No. 46.) Pierce\nsays that Bienvenu would testify about ASL, deaf culture, literacy within the deaf community, lip-\nreading, the importance of using qualified ASL interpreters, and Pierce’s own communicative abilities\nand needs. (See Pl.’s Opp’n to Def.’s Mot to Preclude Pl.’s Experts, ECF No. 57, at 5.) Ray would\ngive expert testimony about the accommodations that would have provided Pierce with the means to\ncommunicate effectively and have meaningful access to prison programs, services, and activities during\nPierce’s incarceration in early 2012. (See id. at 6.) The District argues that neither of these experts will\nhelp the trier of fact because their testimony does not speak to what accommodations were necessary\nfor the Plaintiff in this case, as opposed to the deaf community at large. (See Def.’s Mot. to Preclude\nPl.’s Experts at 4–5.) The District also argues that the proffered testimony is not based on sufficient\nfacts, and is not the product of reliable scientific methods, because the experts did not evaluate what\naccommodations were available at CTF, what accommodations Pierce actually requested, and what\naccommodations were necessary for Pierce to participate in the programs and activities at CTF. (See\nid. at 5–9.) Even assuming arguendo that the District’s objections have a sound legal basis, they\nclearly relate to the weight of the proffered expert testimony, not its admissibility.

The District’s contention regarding Pierce’s\n\nwriting ability is based on its assertion that Pierce “is college educated, has researched\n\nand written term papers for high school and college courses, wrote an autobiography\n\nduring his anger management and substance abuse [class] at CTF, . . . scored above\n\naverage on a written test administered at CTF to assess his reading and writing\n\nabilities[,]” and “communicates with his mother, who lives out of state, through written\n\nFacebook messages.” (See Def. Mot. at 2.) And with respect to lip reading, the District\n\nasserts that the prison employees and contractors who dealt with Pierce believed they\n\nwere effectively communicating with him through lip-reading because Pierce gave\n\nappropriate responses to their oral questions. (See Def.’s Opp’n at 10–11.)\n\n       This Court finds that none of these observations is sufficient to create any\n\ngenuine issue of fact regarding Pierce’s alleged inability to engage in the kinds of\n\ncomplex communications that are required to navigate one’s way through the prison\n\nsystem and to understand official communications regarding medical treatment,\n\nrehabilitative classes, and custodial issues, for several reasons. With respect to the\n\ncollege-level courses that Pierce purportedly took, the record indicates that, although\n\nPierce did attempt to take certain classes, he dropped out after a short period of time.\n\n(See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 12; see also Pierce Dep. 32:21–35:2, Oct. 10, 2013, Ex. 1 to\n\nPl.’s Mot., ECF No. 48-4, at 13–16.) Pierce’s high school research papers were only a\n\nfew pages long, and the record shows that it not only took him two months to write each\n\npaper, he also had classmates edit the papers before he submitted final drafts. (See Pl.’s\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fCont. Facts ¶ 13.) Similarly, Pierce apparently asked another inmate to correct his\n\nautobiography for the anger management/substance abuse class, to “edit from, you\n\nknow quote/unquote, deaf language.” (See Pierce Dep. 245:17–247:21, Feb. 24, 2014,\n\nEx. 2 to Pl.’s Opp’n, ECF No. 58-5, at 9–11.) And whatever Pierce’s score may have\n\nbeen on the standard inmate reading and writing assessment, Pierce’s “above average”\n\nperformance in a test situation says little about his overall ability to understand and to\n\ncommunicate effectively in the context of discussions with prison doctors, teachers, and\n\nother officials.\n\n       Similarly, it goes almost without saying that the District’s argument that Pierce\n\ncould read lips because the District’s employees believed that he could is a nonstarter;\n\nthe District has not shown that its employees had any prior knowledge of, or had\n\nreceived any training about, communicating with deaf inmates. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts\n\n¶¶ 34, 36.) Furthermore, because the prison staff did not undertake any genuine\n\nassessment of Pierce’s limitations and abilities whatsoever, their lay opinions about\n\nwhat worked for Pierce and what Pierce could do amounted to entirely uninformed\n\nspeculation that provides no support for any motion of summary judgment or opposition\n\nthereto.

See Am. Council of the Blind v. Paulson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187155\"><a href=\"/opinion/187155/american-council-of-the-blind-v-paulson/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1266\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2008) (explaining that, once a plaintiff has established a prima facie case for\n\ndisability discrimination, the defendant may assert that accommodating the plaintiffs’\n\ndisabilities would constitute an undue financial or administrative burden or\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, as an affirmative defense to liability).\n\nWhile the District maintains that the provision of anything other than a TTY machine\n\nfor Pierce in order to accommodate his request for telecommunications would have been\n\nan undue burden (see Def.’s Opp’n at 13), and implies that permitting deaf inmates who\n\nare in protective custody to have visitation without handcuffs would be a fundamental\n\nalteration of existing policy (see id. at 17–18), the District makes no such “undue\n\nburden” or “fundamental alteration” contention with respect to Pierce’s request for an\n\ninterpreter, nor could it reasonably have done so, because the DOC apparently has taken\n\nthe official position that ASL interpreters should be provided as a matter of policy.\n\n(See D.C. Dep’t of Corr. Program Statement 3800.3, Ex. 9 to Rocap Decl., ECF No. 48-\n\n5, at 92 § 12(a)(2) (“Written communication cannot be used as a substitute where the\n\nindividual has expressed a preference for a sign language interpreter.”).)\n\n       Finally, with respect to the parties’ disputes of fact regarding the extent to which\n\nPierce was (or was not) denied equal access to accommodations other than an ASL\n\ninterpreter (e.g., use of the TTY machine, official notifications, and CTF’s visitation\n\n\n\n\n                                            46\n\fprocedures), the Court notes that Pierce has alleged that he was treated unequally with\n\nrespect to these aspects of his prison experience in addition to being denied an\n\ninterpreter, and these various alleged instances of discrimination are cited as alternative\n\nbases for finding that the District violated Section 504 and Title II. Thus, the Court\n\nfinds that it need go no further than to conclude that Pierce would be entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on Claims I and II on the basis of Pierce’s unfulfilled request for an\n\nASL interpreter. That is, even if the law is as the District says it is, no reasonable jury\n\ncould find that Pierce failed to request an interpreter, that he needed an interpreter, and\n\nthat the District could have—but did not—provide an interpreter for Pierce with respect\n\nto significant aspects of his incarceration experience. As a result, there is no need for\n\nthe Court to decide whether any genuine issues of fact exist with respect to the prison’s\n\nprovision of telecommunications, notifications, or visitation.\n\n              3.     Because The District Committed Intentional Discrimination, Pierce\n                     Is Entitled To Compensatory Damages On Claims I and II\n\n       At this point, the Court has concluded that the District’s failure to evaluate\n\nPierce’s need for accommodation constituted a violation of Section 504 and Title II as a\n\nmatter of law. (See Part III.A.1 supra.) It has also determined, in the alternative, that\n\neven if the District was only legally obligated to accommodate Pierce’s hearing\n\ndisability if he requested an ASL interpreter and actually needed one, there is no\n\ngenuine dispute that Pierce cannot communicate effectively in English and thus needed\n\nan ASL interpreter in the prison context, or that Pierce actually requested an ASL\n\ninterpreter, which the District could have provided to him. (See Part III.A.2 supra.) In\n\neither case, all that remains of Claims I and II of Pierce’s complaint is the question of\n\ndamages.\n\n\n\n                                             47\n\f        The remedies available for violations of Section 504 and Title II are the remedies\n\nthat pertain to a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, subject to certain defenses\n\nspecific to public entities.

As the Supreme Court has reasoned, Congress was\n\nkeenly aware of the evils of benign neglect when it enacted the federal\n\nantidiscrimination statutes, and “[f]ederal agencies and commentators on the plight of\n\nthe handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped is\n\nprimarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.” Alexander,\n\n469 U.S. at 296.

Furthermore, at least one other\ncourt in this district has applied the deliberate indifference standard in a case involving disability\ndiscrimination. See Hunter ex rel. A.H. v.

It is well established that “[d]eliberate\n\nindifference requires [only] knowledge that a harm to a federally protected right is\n\nsubstantially likely, and a failure to act upon that likelihood[,]” Duvall, 260 F.3d at\n\n1139, and the District’s knowing failure to evaluate Pierce’s need for accommodation\n\nand to provide the auxiliary aids easily satisfies this standard. The District’s employees\n\nand contractors knew that Pierce had a hearing disability, and yet they did not\n\nundertake an assessment of the accommodations that Pierce might need in order to\n\naccess prison services, nor did they provide him with an ASL interpreter for all\n\nsignificant interactions. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 60–64, 77, 88–89, 97, 101, 107.)\n\nThis willful blindness to Pierce’s hearing disability and his need for accommodation\n\nplainly amounts to deliberate indifference, and Pierce is therefore entitled to\n\ncompensatory damages on Claims I and II of his complaint. See, e.g., Bartlett, 970 F.\n\nSupp. at 1151 (holding that defendant was deliberately indifferent where it was aware\n\nof plaintiff’s disability and refused to accommodate the plaintiff).\n\n       B.     There Is A Genuine Dispute Of Fact Regarding Whether Or Not\n              Pierce Was Placed In Protective Custody In Retaliation For His\n              Requests For Accommodation\n\n       Pierce alleges in Claim III of his complaint that the District violated the ADA\n\nand the Rehabilitation Act by “retailat[ing] against [him] for asserting his rights” under\n\nthose statutes. (See Compl. ¶ 51.) Pierce maintains that the District changed his\n\nconditions of confinement for the worse by placing him in protective custody and then\n\nmoving him to the Special Management Unit (“SMU”) within CTF in order to punish\n\nhim for his repeated requests for an ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–47.) The\n\nDistrict seeks summary judgment on this claim, contending that no adverse action was\n\n\n                                            51\n\ftaken against Pierce—he was placed in protective custody because he stated that\n\nanother inmate had threatened him, and he was moved to the SMU for administrative\n\nconvenience. (See Def.’s Mot. at 18.)\n\n        Generally speaking, to prevail on a retaliation claim brought under Section 504\n\nand Title II, a plaintiff must satisfy the burden-shifting framework articulated in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), and its progeny, see, e.g.,\n\nSolomon v.

Pursuant to this framework, the\n\nplaintiff first makes a prima facie case of retaliation; then, the burden shifts to the\n\ndefendant to identify “some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for the adverse\n\naction, McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802; and if the defendant does this, the burden\n\nshifts yet again such that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s stated reason for\n\nthe adverse action was merely a “pretext” for the real, retaliatory purpose, id. at 804.\n\nBecause the District—and the District alone—has moved for summary judgment in its\n\nfavor on Pierce’s retaliation claim, its task under Rule 56 is to demonstrate that no\n\nreasonable jury could conclude that retaliatory animus motivated prison officials with\n\nrespect to Pierce’s placement in protective custody, a task that the District might\n\naccomplish by demonstrating that Pierce cannot establish a prima facie case for\n\nretaliation, or by showing that there is no genuine issue that District’s proffered\n\nexplanation was not a pretext. As explained below, the District has done neither in this\n\ncase.\n\n              1.     Taking All Facts And Inferences In The Non-Movant’s Favor, A\n                     Reasonable Jury Could Find That The Evidence Establishes A\n                     Prima Facie Case For Retaliation\n\n        Under McDonnell Douglas, a plaintiff may establish a prima facie case that\n\ncreates a presumption of retaliation by showing (1) that he engaged in a protected\n\n\n                                             52\n\factivity; (2) that the defendant took adverse action against him; and (3) that there was a\n\ncausal link between the plaintiff’s request for an accommodation and the adverse\n\naction.

First, Pierce\n\nclaims that prison officials placed him in protective custody because he kept asking for\n\nan ASL interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–46.) As Pierce tells the story, he repeatedly\n\nasked Tutwiler (his case manager) for an interpreter (see Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 61), and\n\nhe continued to do so even after Tutwiler told him to stop (see id. ¶ 62). Then, on\n\nFebruary 23, 2012, less than one week after Tutwiler made a note that Pierce “continues\n\nto write request for an interpret [sic] for anger management and drug education” (id.\n\n¶ 61), another inmate shoved Pierce in the TV room and Pierce went to Tutwiler for\n\nassistance (see id. ¶ 102). Tutwiler purportedly asked Pierce if he would like to be\n\nplaced in protective custody—without explaining to him what protective custody was,\n\nwhy it is ordinarily used, how long it would last, or how to request release back into the\n\ngeneral population. (See id. ¶¶ 104, 106.) And when Pierce responded “If necessary[,]”\n\nhe was summarily placed in protective custody in Medical 82, where his freedom of\n\nmovement was substantially more limited. (See Pierce Dep. at 236:5 (stating that\n\nMedical 82 is “complete lockdown”).) Pierce contends that these facts give rise to a\n\nplausible inference that Tutwiler placed him in protective custody in retaliation for his\n\nrequests for an interpreter. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45.)\n\n\n\n16\n   Because the test for retaliation under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act was originally developed in\nthe employment discrimination context, the standards articulated in employment discrimination cases\nare applicable to disability discrimination cases. See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40.\n\n\n\n                                                  53\n\f       Second, Pierce claims that he was retaliated against when he was transferred to\n\nthe SMU while he was in protective custody status and was kept there longer than\n\nnecessary. (See id. at 46–47.) Pierce alleges that, after he went into protective custody\n\non February 23, 2012, he filed two informal resolutions (on February 27, 2012 and\n\nMarch 2, 2012) requesting an interpreter and complaining about limitations on his use\n\nof the TTY. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 62, 132.) Then, on March 1, 2012, Assistant\n\nWarden Fulton was made aware of Pierce’s desire to leave protective custody and to\n\nhave an attorney, but instead of granting Pierce’s requests, Assistant Warden Fulton\n\nallegedly advised the staff to and “review” Pierce’s status again in one week, forcing\n\nPierce to remain in protective custody. (See id. ¶ 109.) Furthermore, in the interim—\n\non March 4, 2012—Pierce was allegedly transferred to the SMU, a unit Pierce describes\n\nas “much, much worse” than his prior protective custody circumstances. (See id. ¶ 111;\n\nsee also Pierce Dep. at 235:20–236:5.) Based on these facts, Pierce alleges that\n\nAssistant Warden Fulton both kept Pierce in protective custody and transferred Pierce\n\nfrom Medical 82 to the Special Management Unit in retaliation for Pierce’s requests for\n\nan interpreter and greater access to the TTY.\n\n       This Court concludes that Defendant is not entitled to summary judgment on the\n\ngrounds that Pierce’s has failed to make out the elements of a prima facie case because\n\nPierce has made plausible allegations—supported by evidence—that (1) he engaged in a\n\nprotected activity; (2) the defendant took adverse action against him; and (3) there was\n\na causal link between the plaintiff’s request for an accommodation and the adverse\n\naction. See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40; see also Holcomb v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186596\"><a href=\"/opinion/186596/holcomb-christine-v-powell-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n903 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“At the prima facie stage of a retaliation claim, a plaintiff’s\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\fburden ‘is not great; [she] merely needs to establish facts adequate to permit an\n\ninference of retaliatory motive.’”); see also id. (reversing grant of summary judgment to\n\nemployer because employee had shown that she engaged in a protected activity and the\n\nemployer took adverse action against her shortly thereafter). There is no question that\n\nPierce’s request for an interpreter was a protected activity. See Solomon, 763 F.3d at\n\n15 (noting that a good faith request for reasonable accommodation constitutes a\n\nprotected activity pursuant to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act). Moreover, Pierce\n\nalleges that placing him in protective custody in Medical 82 and then transferring him\n\nto the SMU were adverse actions because Pierce alleges that the conditions of\n\nconfinement in both of those units were worse than in the general population. See\n\nForkkio v. Powell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185794\"><a href=\"/opinion/185794/forkkio-samuel-e-v-powell-donald/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (noting that a plaintiff suffers\n\nan adverse action where there are “materially adverse consequences affecting the terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges” of plaintiff’s status with defendant). And Pierce claims that it\n\nis reasonable to infer that the District kept Pierce out of the relative comfort of general\n\npopulation because Tutwiler was fed up with his requests and/or wished to punish him\n\nfor his requests for accommodation. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 46.)\n\n       Although the District concedes that a request for accommodation is a protected\n\nactivity under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act and that Pierce made such a request\n\n(see Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶ 24), it argues that “Pierce’s retaliation claim fails because\n\nhe cannot show that the District or any of its contractors at CTF took any adverse action\n\nagainst him as a result of his requests for accommodation, much less that any alleged\n\nadverse action would not have occurred ‘but for’ his requests for accommodation.”\n\n(Def.’s Mot. at 17.) But the District is wrong to contend that the only cognizable\n\n\n\n\n                                             55\n\f“adverse action” in the prison context is a disciplinary infraction (see Def.’s Mot. at\n\n18); indeed, it is well established that any “decision causing a significant change in\n\nbenefits” can constitute an adverse action for the purpose of a retaliation claim. Cf.\n\nBowie v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576912/bowie-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

There is a close\n\ntemporal connection between the protected activity and the alleged adverse actions, and\n\nit is clear that such proximity can support an inference of causation. See Alston, 561 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 43 (citing Woodruff v. Peters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186902\"><a href=\"/opinion/186902/woodruff-phillip-v-peters-mary/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (D.C.

That is,\n\na reasonable jury could believe Pierce’s assertion that Tutwiler placed him in protective\n\ncustody without explaining to him what that was less than one week after she wrote in\n\n\n\n17\n  Although Bowie v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576912\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576912/bowie-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

See Alston, 561 F. Supp. 2d at 40.\nAccordingly, the standards articulated in employment discrimination cases are applicable here. See id.\n18\n   Pierce’s evidence must be credited and all reasonable inferences must be construed in his favor\nbecause the motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim belongs to the District. See Estate\nof Parsons v. Palestinian Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"223086\"><a href=\"/opinion/223086/estate-of-parsons-v-palestinian-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">651</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“The evidence of the non-movant\nis to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                    56\n\fher notes that Pierce was continuously requesting an interpreter in order to end his\n\nincessant entreaties. (See Pl.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 61, 102, 104, 106.) Similarly, a\n\nreasonable jury might find that Pierce was transferred to the Special Management Unit\n\nless than one week after he filed informal resolution forms requesting an interpreter and\n\ncomplaining about the limitations on his use of the TTY (see id. ¶¶ 62, 109, 132),\n\nbecause he had made those requests for accommodation. Indeed, “courts have\n\nrecognized that proof of causal connection can be established indirectly by showing that\n\nprotected activity is followed by discriminatory treatment.” Mitchell v. Baldrige, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450555\"><a href=\"/opinion/450555/wellington-mitchell-v-malcolm-baldrige-secretary-of-commerce/\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 86 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       Therefore, the District has failed to show that Pierce cannot make out a prima\n\nfacie case on his retaliation claim in a manner that entitles it to summary judgment.\n\n              2.     A Reasonable Jury Could Conclude That The District’s Proffered\n                     Reasons For Placing Pierce In Protective Custody Are Pretextual\n\n       Nor has the District shown that it would be impossible for a reasonable jury to\n\nfind that its proffered explanation for sending Pierce to protective custody in Medical\n\n82, and then allegedly keeping him there longer than requested while transferring him\n\nto the Special Management Unit, was pretext for retaliation. In fulfillment of its\n\nobligation to proffer “some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” for its actions,\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, the District argues that it placed Pierce in\n\nprotective custody because Pierce had stated that he feared for his safety, not because of\n\nhis repeated requests for an interpreter (see Def.’s Mot. at 18), and it points out that it\n\nis standard policy at CTF that inmates who request protective custody must be taken out\n\nof general population (see Def.’s Stmt. Of Facts ¶ 157). Thus, far from retaliating\n\nagainst Pierce, the District asserts that Tutwiler was merely following protocol when\n\n\n\n                                             57\n\fshe placed Pierce—who had just reported that he had been pushed by another inmate\n\nand had written out on a protective custody request form that “I fear for my safety”—in\n\nprotective custody. (See Def.’s Mot. at 17; see also Tutwiler Aff., Ex. 11 to Def.’s\n\nMot., ECF No. 52-5, ¶¶ 26–31.) But Pierce disputes the District’s assertion that he\n\nactually requested protective custody status knowingly and voluntarily, and in fact, he\n\nargues that Tutwiler deliberately failed to explain to him what protective custody\n\nmeans. (See Pl.’s Opp’n at 45–46.) Similarly, Pierce contends that a reasonable jury\n\ncould disbelieve the District’s assertion that Pierce was kept in protective custody\n\nbecause he wouldn’t sign the waiver form (Def.’s Stmt. of Facts ¶¶ 167–70), and that he\n\nwas moved from Medical 82 to the Special Management Unit because bed space was\n\nneeded in Medical 82 for an inmate who had serious medical needs (see id. ¶¶ 161, 165;\n\nsee also Fulton Aff., Ex. 2 to Def.’s Mot., ECF No. 52-2, ¶ 31), based on the close\n\ntemporal proximity between the move and his filing of an internal grievance. (See Pl.’s\n\nOpp’n at 47.)\n\n      It is clear to this Court that there are genuine issues of fact regarding whether it\n\nwas because of his repeated requests for an interpreter and his filing of complaints that\n\nprison officials and employees segregated Pierce initially and held him in that allegedly\n\nundesirable segregated status longer than was necessary, and that the resolution of these\n\nfactual disputes depends on the credibility of the testimony of prison staff. Thus, the\n\nretaliation claim cannot be decided by this Court as a matter of law. See Liberty Lobby,\n\nInc., 477 U.S. at 255 (noting that “[c]redibility determinations, the weighing of the\n\nevidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fthose of a judge”). Accordingly, the District’s motion for summary judgment on\n\nPierce’s retaliation claim must be denied.\n\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n       The record in this matter clearly reveals that, when Pierce arrived at CTF to be\n\ntaken into custody, prison officials took no steps whatsoever to evaluate his need for\n\naccommodation so that he would be able to have meaningful access to prison programs\n\nand services within the prison facility. The District’s employees and contractors knew\n\nthat Pierce was profoundly deaf, but instead of engaging in an interactive process\n\ndesigned to ascertain what accommodations would be necessary for Pierce to\n\ncommunicate effectively in prison, they merely assumed that he could read (and\n\nunderstand) the words they mouthed to him and the notes they wrote to him, even after\n\nhe told them “I dont’[sic] understand at all [sic] since I got here” and specifically\n\nrequested an ASL interpreter. It is no wonder that Pierce was confused and upset\n\nthroughout his 51-days in custody, and once even woefully declared, “I feel I [sic]\n\nabandoned.”\n\n       What is astonishing, however, is the District’s insistence in the context of this\n\nlawsuit that its employees’ conduct with respect to accommodating Pierce’s hearing\n\ndisability was entirely consistent with the law. The text and purpose of the\n\nRehabilitation Act and the ADA clearly establish otherwise, and as a result, this Court\n\neasily concludes that the District’s willful blindness regarding Pierce’s need for\n\naccommodation and its half-hearted attempt to provide Pierce with a random assortment\n\nof auxiliary aids—and only after he specifically requested them—fell far short of what\n\nthe law requires. Perhaps most significantly, this Court holds that the District’s clear\n\n\n\n                                             59\n\fviolation of Section 504 and Title II was manifest from the start, when prison\n\nemployees took no steps whatsoever to ascertain what accommodations this new inmate\n\nwith a known hearing disability would require so that communications with him would\n\nbe “as effective as communications with others,” for the purpose of ensuring that he had\n\n“an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of” the prison’s services,\n\nprograms, and activities. 28 C.F.R. §§ 35.160(a)(1), (b)(1)–(2).\n\n       Because this Court finds that the District’s deliberate indifference to Pierce’s\n\naccommodation needs violated Section 504 and Title II as a matter of law, Pierce’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on Claims I and II of the complaint will be GRANTED.\n\nMoreover, the Court finds that the District’s motion for summary judgment must be\n\nDENIED in its entirety, because not only does this Court conclude that the District\n\nunlawfully failed to provide Pierce with meaningful access to prison services, it also\n\nholds that, on the instant record, a reasonable jury could find that CTF employees\n\nretaliated against Pierce as well. Thus, in accordance with the accompanying order, all\n\nthat remains of Pierce’s complaint for trial is the determination of the amount of\n\ncompensatory damages to be awarded to Pierce with respect to Claims I and II, and the\n\nissue of liability (and, if necessary, damages) for Claim III.\n\n\n\n\nDATE: September 11, 2015                  Ketanji Brown Jackson\n                                          KETANJI BROWN JACKSON\n                                          United States District Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                            60\n\f</pre>",
