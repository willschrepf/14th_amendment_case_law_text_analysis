ROBINSON, III, Circuit Judge:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the third time in four years we are confronted with an appeal in litigation commenced more than five years ago to prevent District of Columbia police from interfering with appellant's nocturnal strolls on public thoroughfares in the city.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Now for the third time, we are compelled to adjudicate the appeal without achieving a full resolution of appellant's grievances on the merits.  And for the third time we find that we must remand the case to the District Court to enable further proceedings there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Appellant's lengthy odyssey through the courts was precipitated in 1967 when he was twice stopped and questioned by police officers while walking in the vicinity of Dupont Circle late at night.  On both occasions the officers filled out so-called vagrancy observation forms<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and informed appellant that if he was further observed in the area he would become subject to arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Appellant sought legal advice and subsequently commenced suit in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  He sought specifically a declaration of his right to walk or be in public places while sober and well-behaved, and an injunction restraining police intrusion upon that right.  He also sought expunction from police records of the vagrancy observations which had been made and a declaration that the District's general vagrancy statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> was unconstitutional in toto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the action on several grounds.  On the first appeal, we vacated the dismissal and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On the remand, the District Court again dismissed on the ground that the case was rendered moot by our intervening decision in Ricks v. District of Columbia (Ricks I),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> wherein we held three subsections of the general vagrancy law unconstitutionally vague, and by the discontinuance of police observations under the impugned subsections in response to that decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On the second appeal, we vacated that dismissal and remanded for the proceedings we had envisioned on the first.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was then heard on the merits, and appellant was awarded a part of the relief sought in his complaint.  The District Court's order enjoins the police from interfering with appellant's right to walk or be in any place in the District of Columbia while sober and well-behaved, and requires elimination from police records of all references to the vagrancy observations made of him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Since there is no appeal from so much of the District Court's action, we have no occasion to examine its propriety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Appellant now attacks the court's order because in some respects the relief it afforded fell short of the goals set by his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two errors are alleged: first, that the District Court should have treated the case as a class action and granted relief accordingly; and second, that the court should have held unconstitutional the subsections of the vagrancy statute which were not in issue in Ricks I.  For reasons now to be stated, we are unable to decide either of these questions, but instead must remand the case to the District Court once again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the five years which have elapsed since this litigation began, both the law and police policies governing on-the-street stopping and questioning of citizens have undergone substantial modification.   Ricks I invalidated portions of the District's general vagrancy statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and its companion, Ricks v. United States (Ricks II),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> portions of the District's narcotic vagrancy statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Since these decisions, a plethora of police regulations pertaining to street investigations have been issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Among them are traffic and pedestrian \"spot check\" procedures, which appellant contends are merely the old vagrancy observation measures in new guise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May, 1968, the Supreme Court addressed the problems raised by police investigatory stops and accompanying searches in Terry v. Ohio<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and related cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and established standards to harmonize on-street inquiries and protective frisks with the Fourth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  In response to Terry, the Metropolitan Police Department has issued a nine-page set of guidelines to assist its officers in complying with the constitutionally-mandated requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  And more recently this court, in Hall v. United States<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> and Long v. District of Columbia,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> has dealt with claims of unlawful police interference with the prerogatives of citizens to carry on their activities in public places undisturbed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this backdrop of changing law and practice that appellant has here renewed his request for classaction relief and a declaration of unconstitutionality of the remaining sections of the general vagrancy statute.  But the record before us is bottomed solely on two incidents which occurred more than five years ago in the milieu of legislative and administrative policy of that day.  Given the massive developments intervening since appellant experienced the difficulties alleged in his complaint, we cannot base the determinations he seeks on such a thin foundation.  Two episodes of such vintage hardly generate, simply on their own, a realistic prospect of future repetition, either as to appellant or others.  Quite plainly, they do not suffice as a predicate for an injunction in favor of a class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Even more speculative, in view of current police practices claiming newer sources of authorization, is any potential link between the general vagrancy statute and any further difficulties which appellant or others may encounter.  Neither the District Court nor this court is at liberty to decide constitutional questions posed hypothetically.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Such decisions, rather, are to be rested upon a record which supplies factual support far more adequately than the one now before us does.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in the midst of all the change in the law and its implementation by police, one circumstance allegedly remains unaltered.  Appellant asserts that he is still a target of police harassment while taking his walks at night.  At oral argument his counsel informed us that since the District Court issued its last order, there have been two occasions on which he was stopped and interrogated by police,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> and that on at least one of these a written notation of the incident was made by the officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  In support of his plea for a greater measure of relief than he was awarded in the District Court, appellant has presented to this court a third-party affidavit alleging that other citizens have been subjected in recent months to detention and questioning on the streets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  On the heels of these charges is a disturbing concession by appellees' counsel that the present police spot-check procedures permit citizens to be halted and quizzed even in circumstances under which Terry does not purport to authorize intrusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this new information was brought to light after this case had left the District Court, it is outside the record on appeal.  We think, however, that it constitutes enough of a showing to entitle appellant to an opportunity to update his lawsuit as a predicate for possible further relief.  As a part of our appellate jurisdiction, we are empowered to \"remand the cause and . . . require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> 9] This broad authorization clearly encompasses remands for the purpose of renovating the pleadings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> and taking additional evidence;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> and, once appellant is again in the District Court, he will be free to appropriately supplement his complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  That may include allegation of recent incidents,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> joinder of additional parties<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and, of course, presentation of such legal contentions as may be indicated.  After suitable response by appellees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> the District Court will be in position to hear any meritorious claims forthcoming, and to expeditiously resolve them-individually or as a class-on a concrete basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of the hardships imposed on parties where, as here, the wheels of justice grind so slowly that they may appear to hardly turn at all.  Justice that is both swift and sure is the millennium and must remain increasingly the goal of us all.  Yet it sometimes happens, however regrettably, that speed in adjudication must to some extent yield to quality of adjudication.  The case before us demands such a yielding to enable a sound evaluation of appellant's contentions in the context of current police investigatory methods and their precise impact upon him and others.  To that end we must remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.  Of course, it is for appellant to determine the tactical course he wishes to pursue, and we intimate no view on the merits of any controversy ensuing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other aspect of this litigation merits discussion.  The power of the District Court to entertain appellant's suit has not been challenged, but the jurisdictional foundation upon which the court proceeded is unclear.  Of three bases averred in appellant's complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> one is inefficacious,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> another is unsustained<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> and the third, though serviceable in this litigation, is no longer available to would-be litigants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  The record contains no express jurisdictional determination nor does it indicate that, beyond the jurisdictional grounds alleged in the complaint and contested in appellees' answer, the parties have addressed the question.  Since the jurisdiction of a federal court is an everpresent concern,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> the problem deserves more attention than it has received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We put aside at once appellant's claim of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1343(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  Evidently appellant has theorized that the incidents he complained of gave rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> which was cognizable in the District Court by virtue of Section 1343(3).  But very recently, in District of Columbia v. Carter,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a> the Supreme Court held that no right to sue under Section 1983 is generated by action of the District of Columbia or its representatives.  Our reading of Carter in light of the common origin and objectives of the two sections convinces us that Section 1343(3) does not furnish a federal forum for the case at bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look next to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(a) -the general federal-question provision -which vests in the district courts jurisdiction of civil actions in which the matter in controversy \"arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\" and exceeds $10,000 in principal \"sum or value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  We are satisfied that appellant's complaint spelled out a controversy arising under the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> and consequently that Section 1331(a) conferred jurisdiction if the required amount were involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  Our difficulty, however, is that on the record before us we cannot be sure that the amount prerequisite was really at stake.  To be sure, appellant formally alleged that the amount in controversy exceeded the statutory minimum, but appellees denied that allegation in their answer and the matter was dropped at that point.  The record is barren of any further effort by the parties to either establish or disestablish this jurisdictional element, and of any determination by the District Court on that score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the call for federalquestion jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) is meritorious, the task of demonstrating the propriety of the invocation is not particularly onerous.  The complaint need only show that in good faith he advances a nonfrivolous claim necessitating an application of federal law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> and having a value meeting the statutory specifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a>  When the action solicits damages, the amount sued for is deemed to have been fixed in good faith so long as it is not clear to a legal certainty that no recovery could satisfy the statutory standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a>  Somewhat more is demanded when an injunction or other equitable relief is sought, though hardly more than the definitive valuation which a clear-cut presentation would entail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a>  But when, as here, a formal allegation of jurisdictional amount-albeit one sufficient from a pleading standpoint-is controverted, a factual issue emerges<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> and the burden of establishing jurisdictional amount is thrust upon the claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a>  We do not doubt the amenability of the right asserted by appellant to pecuniary valuation of a type acceptable for purposes of Section 1331(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  The trouble here is that the demonstration which appellant was summoned to make is nowhere to be found in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do find, however, an adequate jurisdictional base, irrespective of the amount truly in controversy, in the provisions of D.C.Code Sec. 11-521(a) (1) which were in force when appellant's suit was instituted in the District Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a>  Those provisions gave the District Court \"original jurisdiction of all . . . civil actions between parties, where either or both of them are resident or found within the District,\" save where \"exclusive jurisdiction is conferred by law upon other courts in the District.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a>  The record shows amply the required residency, and we think the exclusivity requirement was met also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that, when appellant brought his suit, the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> possessed \"exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions . . . in which the claimed value of personal property or the debt or damages claimed does not exceed the sum of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a>  That does not affect the conclusion we reach because appellant's goal was equitable relief of a type which the Court of General Sessions could not award.  While that court undoubtedly possessed some equitable powers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> it has long been settled that they were confined to controversies which fell within its statutory grant of jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  So, although the Court of General Sessions had such equitable powers as were necessary to enable it to fully exercise the jurisdiction conferred,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> those powers were incidental and limited to just that, and not primary or more general than the exigencies of the jurisdictional exercise required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not seek recovery of any \"personal property or\" any \"debt or damages,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> He sued, rather, for declaratory and injunctive relief to protect a fundamental personal right.  It is clear that the Court of General Sessions lacked authority to entertain that suit<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> and that, by the same token, the District Court acquired jurisdiction under Section 11-521(a) (1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> when the complaint was filed.  And notwithstanding the subsequent repeal of that section,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> the jurisdiction it conferred over this litigation subsists today.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded to the District Court for such further proceedings in harmony with this opinion as appellant may be inclined to initiate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BAZELON, Chief Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that this case should be remanded for further proceedings.  But, I object to the court's apparent failure to recognize our obligation to seek the earliest possible resolution of this more than five year old law suit by providing some guidance for the District Court's consideration.  Otherwise, the delay may take its toll in the deprivation of basic constitutional rights, the exacerbation of friction between the police and the ghetto community, and the loss of the courts' credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* There is clearly substantial evidence to support the District Court's finding that \"presently vagrancy observations [the police practice originally complained of] result from 'spot check' observation forms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The court today does not say otherwise; it accepts the District Court's findings as \"impregnable\" because not challenged on appeal.  The history of the \"spot check\" procedure makes it quite clear that it is but the vagrancy observation of old, with name and form number changed, but the same unconstitutional standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to this court's Ricks decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> the police department issued the so-called Layton memorandum of February 17, 1969.  That document, dealing in part with vagrancy observations, said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>. . . [T]he arrest policies announced herein do not preclude an officer from observing persons engaged in suspicious activity in a public place and from approaching those persons and making inquiry. . . . In those circumstances where a person refuses to identify himself or does not give a reasonable explaination of his conduct, the officer should make an accurate and detailed record of the person's physical description and other significant characteristics, clothing worn and the explanations furnished.  (Emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"spot check,\" in contrast, began its existence as a traffic enforcement device, to be employed with a view towards \"detecting persons operating without a valid driving license.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  However, after the Supreme Court decided Terry v. Ohio,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> the \"spot check\" underwent a major transformation in both purpose and scope.

(emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the spot check procedure authorized the stopping of pedestrians under the same vague standard-mere \"suspicion\"-as the earlier vagrancy observations.  It seems clear that spot checks are but another way of implementing the policy of the Layton memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court correctly determined that spot checks are an unconstitutional police practice, a conclusion the court today characterizes as \"impregnable\".  The District Judge properly rejected the Government's assertion that because a person who is stopped has an unspoken right to continue walking and ignore a policeman's inquiries, he has not been seized.  The memoranda describing the practice themselves cast doubt on the accuracy of the government's suggestion.  And the Supreme Court in Terry held that the stop stage of an encounter is coextensive with a seizure, hence within the purview of the 4th Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>It must be recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has 'seized' that person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the trial judge perceptively observed, when a policeman stops and questions a person, the officer's \"uniform, badge and all other indicia of his power as a law enforcement authority\" compel an obedient response.  The person is surely \"restrained.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Terry and related cases<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> the Court also carefully defined by what standards a police officer's intrusion on an ordinary citizen's privacy would be constitutionally permissible.  Those cases held that an officer must \"be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>  In contrast, spot check stops are authorized on mere suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently struck down that state's similar vehicle spot check procedure.  Although noting that such stops may serve a law enforcement purpose, the court declared them unconstitutional under the Terry test.  The court warned that if the police were allowed to stop automobiles without being able to \"point to specific and articulable facts\", they could intrude on \"basic constitutional rights on the basis of subjective prejudices.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government admitted at oral argument in this case that the spot check does not meet Terry standards.  Accordingly, the District Court properly found that police interferences with the appellant's late night walks pursuant to a mere \"suspicion' standard were unconstitutional and the court's injunction restrained the police from stopping Gomez under the guise of either a vagrancy observation or spot check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn now to the question of remedy.  We have said that the District Court found Gomez had been the victim of unconstitutional police action.  The question that court must face on remand is whether this conduct is sufficiently widespread to sustain class action relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that we are not here faced with the mere assertion of a solitary isolated incident, as we were in Long v. District of Columbia, where the court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>In [Gomez] there was an official, publicly adopted policy . . . under attack.  There was no question that the procedures objected to occurred regularly and would occur again in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The President's 1967 Crime Commission suggested that the courts recognize \"the importance of the administrative policymaking function of [the] police\" and \"take appropriate steps to make this a process which is . . . articulate and responsive to external controls appropriate in a democratic society.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  Likening the police policymaking function to that of an administrative agency, the Commission called on the courts to develop judicial remedies that would \"require the law enforcement agency to articulate its policy and to defend it, and if the challenge is successful to change the policy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a>  The Commission specifically referred to the need for such an articulation and review of police policies about street investigative stops.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The American Bar Association has also focused on the need for providing positive guidance to the police, \"rather than concentrating solely on penalizing improper police conduct,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a> as by application of the exclusionary rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-1\" id=\"fn19-1_ref\">19</a>  The ABA Report specifically approved of \"injunctive actions to terminate a pattern of unlawful conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-1\" id=\"fn20-1_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The class action injunctive suit is one means by which the police can be required to identify, articulate, and defend, as well as be afforded an opportunity to change, their official policies and practices.  The class action, by its very nature, focuses on the broad policy rather than the individual incident.  Hence, it provides the kind of positive guidance suggested by the ABA and the kind of remedy called for by the Crime Commission.  But, it can only be a workable remedy if there is not an intolerable burden on a petitioner to demonstrate the widespread scope of application of an articulated police policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21-1\" id=\"fn21-1_ref\">21</a>  It is illogical, if not irrational, to require a plaintiff to establish that the five thousand men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department are doing what they have been instructed to do.  Rather, where a petitioner shows that a police practice, as described in official communications or regulations, is unconstitutional, the burden of going forward should shift to the police on the question of whether the application of the practice is widespread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The already lengthy history of this litigation indicates that it may yet be far from over.  As to the interim period, the record suggests the propriety of a preliminary injunction against spot checks not meeting Terry standards.  The appellant has not requested relief pendente lite; but, on remand, the District Court may properly entertain a petition for such relief.  The requirements are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>1) the party in whose favor the relief is to run must make a strong showing that he is likely to ultimately prevail on the merits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>2) there must be a danger of irreparable injury;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>3) to be balanced against the extent to which the relief would harm the other party; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>4) the court must determine where lies the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-1\" id=\"fn22-1_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the likelihood of appellant's success on the merits, it is already clear that the spot check procedure does not meet the test articulated in Terry.  The issue on remand is the proper scope of relief.  The official police documents describing spot checks and the affidavits of the appellant and other citizens who have been subjected to unlawful street stops and interrogations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-1\" id=\"fn23-1_ref\">23</a> if accurate, would support the conclusion that the spot check procedure is sufficiently widespread to justify an injunction in favor of the class suggested by appellant.  But those affidavits were not before the District Court nor were they properly before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court should also consider to what extent its limited relief has been effective to protect the appellant. Evidence has been proffered to us that the appellant himself has been stopped twice more since the entry of that order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24-1\" id=\"fn24-1_ref\">24</a>  Thus the question arises whether the rights of appellant or any individual can be adequately protected without protecting those of the public generally.  It is hardly likely that the appellant is the only person being stopped and interrogated pursuant to the unconstitutional spot check procedures. \"[O]nce [an unconstitutional practice] is found, . . . the court must order . . . it discontinued [and its] decree may not-either expressly or impliedly-authorize [its continuation] against others.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25-1\" id=\"fn25-1_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court will also have to determine whether there is a danger of immediate and irreparable injury.  It may find that if preliminary relief is not granted, no protection will be afforded the public from these unconstitutional street stops pending this litigation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26-1\" id=\"fn26-1_ref\">26</a>-since whatever permanent injunctive or declaratory relief is ultimately granted will have only prospective effect.  The court could thus measure the cost of its delay in terms of the infringements on the constitutional rights of all those citizens who, in the months or years before this case reaches its long overdue conclusion, will be illegally detained by the police.  The value of the resultant loss of constitutional rights is neither easily measurable nor, as a practical matter, fully compensable in dollars and cents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27-1\" id=\"fn27-1_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court may not ignore what might be lost by the government should a preliminary injunction issue.  Courts certainly should not involve themselves unnecessarily in police matters and should consider the degree to which proper activity and discretion may be curtailed by the preliminary relief.  But if unconstitutional street stops are widespread, the police would properly be enjoined from undertaking them at all in the future.  And if spot checks not meeting Terry standards are not widespread, what is lost by a narrowly drawn order restraining an uncommon practice?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final element to be weighed by the District Court is the public interest.  In this inquiry, I do not think the court can ignore who the appellant and his lawyer are.  The appellant is a poor man and a member of a racial minority.  The President's 1967 Crime Commission observed that police field interrogations are directed predominantly at and often conducted indiscriminately among that very class of citizens.  As a result, the Commission warned, street stops are a major source of friction between police and minority groups, creating resentment of the police in the urban ghettos.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28-1\" id=\"fn28-1_ref\">28</a>  It would surely seem in the public interest to minimize such friction by at least insuring that street stops are carried out in a way consonant with Constitutional guarantees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29-1\" id=\"fn29-1_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guarantees of the Constitution exist for all men, rich and poor alike.  But to say that such rights exist for all men is only meaningful if both rich and poor have the means to secure them.  Since appellant is a poor man, he could not himself afford the crippling cost of this extended litigation.  He would not be before the courts today were it not for the voluntary representation of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose resources, it now appears, may be insufficient for the burdens imposed by the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30-1\" id=\"fn30-1_ref\">30</a>  The court has a moral as well as a legal obligation to be mindful of these matters<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31-1\" id=\"fn31-1_ref\">31</a> in considering this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the court today is sending appellant back to the District Court once more without meaningful relief and without any guidelines for that court's consideration of an appropriate remedy.  The court is, in effect, sending appellant back down to the bottom of the hill that he began climbing five long years ago, and instructing him to begin anew.  In my view, the District Court should be instructed on remand to consider the affidavits presented to us, as well as other matters,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32-1\" id=\"fn32-1_ref\">32</a> in accordance with some guidance from us for the determination of appropriate interim relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in this case has been before the courts for more than five years.  The police have been defending on the ground that their spot check procedure is proper.  It may then well be that they have been engaging in that practice every day, all day long, while the complaint is unresolved.  Since we piously refrain from expediting the solution, we are part of the problem.  What credibility do we then have in urging the victims of police misconduct to rely on the courts-not on the streets-to redress their grievances?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Our earlier decisions in this case are Gomez v.

The school board, however, closed the county's public schools and refused to reopen them, and participated in a plan assisting attendance at private schools operated for white children only.  A supplemental complaint was thereafter filed in the original action charging use of state funds to support segregated schools and seeking an injunction compelling the reopening of the public schools.  In sustaining the propriety of that procedure, the Court said:</p>\n        <p>Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules . . . plainly permits supplemental amendments to cover events happening after suit, and it follows, of course, that persons participating in these new events may be added if necessary.

While agreeing that a remand is necessary, asserts that we should facilitate the completion of this litigation by offering guidance to the District Court.  Because we do not adopt the exposition the opinion makes, it accuses us of impairing the credibility of the court.  The only substantial \"guidance\" which the opinion volunteers, however, consists of a discussion of the feasibility of a preliminary injunction against spot checks pending conclusion of the remand.  We would not presume to instruct experienced counsel or a trial judge more than thirty years on the bench as to the well know criteria for granting such injunctions</p>\n        <p>Moreover, appellant already has a permanent injunction affording him individually every bit of the protection asked in his complaint, and obviously has also the prerogative of charging any violation of that injunction as a contempt of court.  To be sure, a preliminary injunction, if granted, would ban spot checks temporarily while the proceedings continue, but it would not bring about the ultimate determination on the merits any sooner.  Nor, despite the substantial amount of \"guidance\" proffered, do we find any suggestion in the separate opinion that would shorten the dispositional process one whit.

At one end of the spectrum are the courts which have held that such rights are incapable of monetary valuation, and thus that no jurisdiction lies under Sec. 1331(a).  See Goldsmith v. Sutherland, supra note 49, 426 F.2d at 1398; Giancana v. Johnson, supra note 49, 335 F.2d at 369; Boyd v. Clark, supra note 49, 287 F.Supp. at 564.  On the opposite end are courts and judges espousing the view that some rights are so fundamental that their inherent worth must be equal to any amount set for jurisdictional purposes.  See Giancana v. Johnson, supra note 49, 335 F.2d at 371 (dissenting opinion); West End Neighborhood Corp. v. Stans, 312 F.Supp. 1066, 1068 (D.D.C.1970); Cortright v.

Clark, supra note 49, 287 F.Supp. at 568 (dissenting opinion); Murray v. Vaughn, 300 F.Supp. 688, 695-696 (D.R.I.1969)</p>\n        <p>The source of much of the discord in this area is the oft-quoted statement in Justice Stone's opinion in Hague v. CIO, 307 U.S. 496, 529, 59 S.Ct. 954, 970, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939), that \"[t]here are many rights and immunities secured by the Constitution, of which freedom of speech and assembly are conspicuous examples, which are not capable of money valuation, and in many instances, like the present, no suit in equity could be maintained for their protection if proof of the jurisdictional amount were prerequisite.\"  We are constrained to point out here that this declaration represented the view of only two members of the Court, a view which was diametrically opposed by other members.  Id. at 507-508, 59 S.Ct. at 960 (opinion of Justice Roberts).  The statement has never been adopted by a majority of the Court in any subsequent case, and its efficacy became the more doubtful when the Court recently concluded that \"the dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one.\"  Lynch  v. Household Finance Corp., supra note 49, 405 U.S. at 552, 92 S.Ct. at 1122.  With the remarkable expansion of remedies in damages to enable redress of invasions of an incalculable variety of personal interests, monetary valuation of fundamental civil rights seems hardly impossible today.  Surely it was not impossible in this case.  Compare Bivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed.2d 619 (1971); Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 684-685, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946); Pinkerton Nat. Detective Agency v. Stevens, 108 Ga.App. 159, 132 S.E.2d 119, 124 (1963); Lukas v. J. C. Penney Co., 233 Or. 345, 378 P.2d 717, 721 (Or.1963); Cullen v. Dickenson, 33 S.D. 27, 144 N.W. 656, 658 (1913).</p>\n        <p>By our analysis, the value which a particular right may command in a given case is a different question from its susceptibility to any pecuniary valuation at all.  As a matter of pure logic, the ability to attach a money value to a right is not necessarily the ability to assign it a value satisfying the jurisdictional requirement of Sec. 1331(a).  In Hague v. CIO, supra, three members of the Court felt that asserted rights of free speech and assembly had to meet the jurisdictional-amount test, and two others that it was impossible for them to do so. 307 U.S. at 507-508, 529-531, 532, 59 S.Ct. 954.  The continuing undifferentiated application of that test and the assimilation of personal and property rights hardly signals an imminent departure from that aspect of Hague.  See Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., supra note 49, 405 U.S. at 542, 546-552, 92 S.Ct. 1113.  On the contrary, only recently this court adhered to the Hague approach.  Tatum v. Laird, supra note 53, 144 U.S.App. D.C. at 74-76, 444 F.2d at 949-951.  So notwithstanding a deep-seated feeling that price-tagging of fundamental human rights is dangerous business, we realize that any automatic finding of the required amount in controversy just because such rights are in issue may be a more simplistic solution than Sec. 1331(a) will tolerate.  Moreover, we find it hard to believe that demonstration of jurisdictional amount is a difficult undertaking where the right asserted is truly basic.  At least for the time being, then, we will cling to the middle course which permits complainants in suits under Sec. 1331(a) for injunctive relief against federal and District officers to allege and show that the value of the rights sought to be protected exceeds the required jurisdictional amount.

And for the third time we find that we must remand the case to the District Court to enable further proceedings there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Appellant's lengthy odyssey through the courts was precipitated in 1967 when he was twice stopped and questioned by police officers while walking in the vicinity of Dupont Circle late at night.  On both occasions the officers filled out so-called vagrancy observation forms<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and informed appellant that if he was further observed in the area he would become subject to arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Appellant sought legal advice and subsequently commenced suit in the District Court for declaratory and injunctive relief.  He sought specifically a declaration of his right to walk or be in public places while sober and well-behaved, and an injunction restraining police intrusion upon that right.  He also sought expunction from police records of the vagrancy observations which had been made and a declaration that the District's general vagrancy statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> was unconstitutional in toto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the action on several grounds.  On the first appeal, we vacated the dismissal and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  On the remand, the District Court again dismissed on the ground that the case was rendered moot by our intervening decision in Ricks v. District of Columbia (Ricks I),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> wherein we held three subsections of the general vagrancy law unconstitutionally vague, and by the discontinuance of police observations under the impugned subsections in response to that decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  On the second appeal, we vacated that dismissal and remanded for the proceedings we had envisioned on the first.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was then heard on the merits, and appellant was awarded a part of the relief sought in his complaint.  The District Court's order enjoins the police from interfering with appellant's right to walk or be in any place in the District of Columbia while sober and well-behaved, and requires elimination from police records of all references to the vagrancy observations made of him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Since there is no appeal from so much of the District Court's action, we have no occasion to examine its propriety.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Appellant now attacks the court's order because in some respects the relief it afforded fell short of the goals set by his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two errors are alleged: first, that the District Court should have treated the case as a class action and granted relief accordingly; and second, that the court should have held unconstitutional the subsections of the vagrancy statute which were not in issue in Ricks I.  For reasons now to be stated, we are unable to decide either of these questions, but instead must remand the case to the District Court once again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the five years which have elapsed since this litigation began, both the law and police policies governing on-the-street stopping and questioning of citizens have undergone substantial modification.   Ricks I invalidated portions of the District's general vagrancy statute<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and its companion, Ricks v. United States (Ricks II),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> portions of the District's narcotic vagrancy statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Since these decisions, a plethora of police regulations pertaining to street investigations have been issued.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Among them are traffic and pedestrian \"spot check\" procedures, which appellant contends are merely the old vagrancy observation measures in new guise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May, 1968, the Supreme Court addressed the problems raised by police investigatory stops and accompanying searches in Terry v. Ohio<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> and related cases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> and established standards to harmonize on-street inquiries and protective frisks with the Fourth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  In response to Terry, the Metropolitan Police Department has issued a nine-page set of guidelines to assist its officers in complying with the constitutionally-mandated requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  And more recently this court, in Hall v. United States<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> and Long v. District of Columbia,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> has dealt with claims of unlawful police interference with the prerogatives of citizens to carry on their activities in public places undisturbed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is against this backdrop of changing law and practice that appellant has here renewed his request for classaction relief and a declaration of unconstitutionality of the remaining sections of the general vagrancy statute.  But the record before us is bottomed solely on two incidents which occurred more than five years ago in the milieu of legislative and administrative policy of that day.  Given the massive developments intervening since appellant experienced the difficulties alleged in his complaint, we cannot base the determinations he seeks on such a thin foundation.  Two episodes of such vintage hardly generate, simply on their own, a realistic prospect of future repetition, either as to appellant or others.  Quite plainly, they do not suffice as a predicate for an injunction in favor of a class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Even more speculative, in view of current police practices claiming newer sources of authorization, is any potential link between the general vagrancy statute and any further difficulties which appellant or others may encounter.  Neither the District Court nor this court is at liberty to decide constitutional questions posed hypothetically.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a>  Such decisions, rather, are to be rested upon a record which supplies factual support far more adequately than the one now before us does.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, in the midst of all the change in the law and its implementation by police, one circumstance allegedly remains unaltered.  Appellant asserts that he is still a target of police harassment while taking his walks at night.  At oral argument his counsel informed us that since the District Court issued its last order, there have been two occasions on which he was stopped and interrogated by police,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> and that on at least one of these a written notation of the incident was made by the officers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a>  In support of his plea for a greater measure of relief than he was awarded in the District Court, appellant has presented to this court a third-party affidavit alleging that other citizens have been subjected in recent months to detention and questioning on the streets.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a>  On the heels of these charges is a disturbing concession by appellees' counsel that the present police spot-check procedures permit citizens to be halted and quizzed even in circumstances under which Terry does not purport to authorize intrusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since this new information was brought to light after this case had left the District Court, it is outside the record on appeal.  We think, however, that it constitutes enough of a showing to entitle appellant to an opportunity to update his lawsuit as a predicate for possible further relief.  As a part of our appellate jurisdiction, we are empowered to \"remand the cause and . . . require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a> 9] This broad authorization clearly encompasses remands for the purpose of renovating the pleadings<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a> and taking additional evidence;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a> and, once appellant is again in the District Court, he will be free to appropriately supplement his complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a>  That may include allegation of recent incidents,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a> joinder of additional parties<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> and, of course, presentation of such legal contentions as may be indicated.  After suitable response by appellees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> the District Court will be in position to hear any meritorious claims forthcoming, and to expeditiously resolve them-individually or as a class-on a concrete basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful of the hardships imposed on parties where, as here, the wheels of justice grind so slowly that they may appear to hardly turn at all.  Justice that is both swift and sure is the millennium and must remain increasingly the goal of us all.  Yet it sometimes happens, however regrettably, that speed in adjudication must to some extent yield to quality of adjudication.  The case before us demands such a yielding to enable a sound evaluation of appellant's contentions in the context of current police investigatory methods and their precise impact upon him and others.  To that end we must remand the case to the District Court for further proceedings.  Of course, it is for appellant to determine the tactical course he wishes to pursue, and we intimate no view on the merits of any controversy ensuing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One other aspect of this litigation merits discussion.  The power of the District Court to entertain appellant's suit has not been challenged, but the jurisdictional foundation upon which the court proceeded is unclear.  Of three bases averred in appellant's complaint,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> one is inefficacious,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a> another is unsustained<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> and the third, though serviceable in this litigation, is no longer available to would-be litigants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a>  The record contains no express jurisdictional determination nor does it indicate that, beyond the jurisdictional grounds alleged in the complaint and contested in appellees' answer, the parties have addressed the question.  Since the jurisdiction of a federal court is an everpresent concern,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a> the problem deserves more attention than it has received.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We put aside at once appellant's claim of jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1343(3).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a>  Evidently appellant has theorized that the incidents he complained of gave rise to a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> which was cognizable in the District Court by virtue of Section 1343(3).  But very recently, in District of Columbia v. Carter,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a> the Supreme Court held that no right to sue under Section 1983 is generated by action of the District of Columbia or its representatives.  Our reading of Carter in light of the common origin and objectives of the two sections convinces us that Section 1343(3) does not furnish a federal forum for the case at bar.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We look next to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(a) -the general federal-question provision -which vests in the district courts jurisdiction of civil actions in which the matter in controversy \"arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\" and exceeds $10,000 in principal \"sum or value.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fn47_ref\">47</a>  We are satisfied that appellant's complaint spelled out a controversy arising under the Constitution,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fn48_ref\">48</a> and consequently that Section 1331(a) conferred jurisdiction if the required amount were involved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fn49_ref\">49</a>  Our difficulty, however, is that on the record before us we cannot be sure that the amount prerequisite was really at stake.  To be sure, appellant formally alleged that the amount in controversy exceeded the statutory minimum, but appellees denied that allegation in their answer and the matter was dropped at that point.  The record is barren of any further effort by the parties to either establish or disestablish this jurisdictional element, and of any determination by the District Court on that score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the call for federalquestion jurisdiction under Section 1331(a) is meritorious, the task of demonstrating the propriety of the invocation is not particularly onerous.  The complaint need only show that in good faith he advances a nonfrivolous claim necessitating an application of federal law<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fn50_ref\">50</a> and having a value meeting the statutory specifications.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fn51_ref\">51</a>  When the action solicits damages, the amount sued for is deemed to have been fixed in good faith so long as it is not clear to a legal certainty that no recovery could satisfy the statutory standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fn52_ref\">52</a>  Somewhat more is demanded when an injunction or other equitable relief is sought, though hardly more than the definitive valuation which a clear-cut presentation would entail.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fn53_ref\">53</a>  But when, as here, a formal allegation of jurisdictional amount-albeit one sufficient from a pleading standpoint-is controverted, a factual issue emerges<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fn54_ref\">54</a> and the burden of establishing jurisdictional amount is thrust upon the claimant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fn55_ref\">55</a>  We do not doubt the amenability of the right asserted by appellant to pecuniary valuation of a type acceptable for purposes of Section 1331(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fn56_ref\">56</a>  The trouble here is that the demonstration which appellant was summoned to make is nowhere to be found in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fn57_ref\">57</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do find, however, an adequate jurisdictional base, irrespective of the amount truly in controversy, in the provisions of D.C.Code Sec. 11-521(a) (1) which were in force when appellant's suit was instituted in the District Court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fn58_ref\">58</a>  Those provisions gave the District Court \"original jurisdiction of all . . . civil actions between parties, where either or both of them are resident or found within the District,\" save where \"exclusive jurisdiction is conferred by law upon other courts in the District.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fn59_ref\">59</a>  The record shows amply the required residency, and we think the exclusivity requirement was met also.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are mindful that, when appellant brought his suit, the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fn60_ref\">60</a> possessed \"exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions . . . in which the claimed value of personal property or the debt or damages claimed does not exceed the sum of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fn61_ref\">61</a>  That does not affect the conclusion we reach because appellant's goal was equitable relief of a type which the Court of General Sessions could not award.  While that court undoubtedly possessed some equitable powers,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fn62_ref\">62</a> it has long been settled that they were confined to controversies which fell within its statutory grant of jurisdiction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fn63_ref\">63</a>  So, although the Court of General Sessions had such equitable powers as were necessary to enable it to fully exercise the jurisdiction conferred,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fn64_ref\">64</a> those powers were incidental and limited to just that, and not primary or more general than the exigencies of the jurisdictional exercise required.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fn65_ref\">65</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant did not seek recovery of any \"personal property or\" any \"debt or damages,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fn66_ref\">66</a> He sued, rather, for declaratory and injunctive relief to protect a fundamental personal right.  It is clear that the Court of General Sessions lacked authority to entertain that suit<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fn67_ref\">67</a> and that, by the same token, the District Court acquired jurisdiction under Section 11-521(a) (1)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fn68_ref\">68</a> when the complaint was filed.  And notwithstanding the subsequent repeal of that section,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fn69_ref\">69</a> the jurisdiction it conferred over this litigation subsists today.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fn70_ref\">70</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded to the District Court for such further proceedings in harmony with this opinion as appellant may be inclined to initiate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BAZELON, Chief Judge (concurring in part and dissenting in part):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I agree that this case should be remanded for further proceedings.  But, I object to the court's apparent failure to recognize our obligation to seek the earliest possible resolution of this more than five year old law suit by providing some guidance for the District Court's consideration.  Otherwise, the delay may take its toll in the deprivation of basic constitutional rights, the exacerbation of friction between the police and the ghetto community, and the loss of the courts' credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* There is clearly substantial evidence to support the District Court's finding that \"presently vagrancy observations [the police practice originally complained of] result from 'spot check' observation forms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The court today does not say otherwise; it accepts the District Court's findings as \"impregnable\" because not challenged on appeal.  The history of the \"spot check\" procedure makes it quite clear that it is but the vagrancy observation of old, with name and form number changed, but the same unconstitutional standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to this court's Ricks decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> the police department issued the so-called Layton memorandum of February 17, 1969.  That document, dealing in part with vagrancy observations, said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>. . . [T]he arrest policies announced herein do not preclude an officer from observing persons engaged in suspicious activity in a public place and from approaching those persons and making inquiry. . . . In those circumstances where a person refuses to identify himself or does not give a reasonable explaination of his conduct, the officer should make an accurate and detailed record of the person's physical description and other significant characteristics, clothing worn and the explanations furnished.  (Emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"spot check,\" in contrast, began its existence as a traffic enforcement device, to be employed with a view towards \"detecting persons operating without a valid driving license.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  However, after the Supreme Court decided Terry v. Ohio,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a> the \"spot check\" underwent a major transformation in both purpose and scope.  The new purpose was described in police department communications as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>Effective use of this new PD 725 spot check form in recording suspicious persons . . . in our area can be an invaluable aid in assisting in this District's effort to control crime and identify and apprehend offenders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another police communication, certainly reminiscent of the Layton memorandum, further explains the expanded use of spot checks:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>The traffic check form currently in use shall also be used for stopping and checking suspicious persons on foot.  Members shall take the person's name, nickname, date of birth, address, location of stop, general physical description and description of clothing worn.  (emphasis added)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most importantly, the spot check procedure authorized the stopping of pedestrians under the same vague standard-mere \"suspicion\"-as the earlier vagrancy observations.  It seems clear that spot checks are but another way of implementing the policy of the Layton memorandum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court correctly determined that spot checks are an unconstitutional police practice, a conclusion the court today characterizes as \"impregnable\".  The District Judge properly rejected the Government's assertion that because a person who is stopped has an unspoken right to continue walking and ignore a policeman's inquiries, he has not been seized.  The memoranda describing the practice themselves cast doubt on the accuracy of the government's suggestion.  And the Supreme Court in Terry held that the stop stage of an encounter is coextensive with a seizure, hence within the purview of the 4th Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>It must be recognized that whenever a police officer accosts an individual and restrains his freedom to walk away, he has 'seized' that person.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9-1\" id=\"fn9-1_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the trial judge perceptively observed, when a policeman stops and questions a person, the officer's \"uniform, badge and all other indicia of his power as a law enforcement authority\" compel an obedient response.  The person is surely \"restrained.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Terry and related cases<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10-1\" id=\"fn10-1_ref\">10</a> the Court also carefully defined by what standards a police officer's intrusion on an ordinary citizen's privacy would be constitutionally permissible.  Those cases held that an officer must \"be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11-1\" id=\"fn11-1_ref\">11</a>  In contrast, spot check stops are authorized on mere suspicion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania recently struck down that state's similar vehicle spot check procedure.  Although noting that such stops may serve a law enforcement purpose, the court declared them unconstitutional under the Terry test.  The court warned that if the police were allowed to stop automobiles without being able to \"point to specific and articulable facts\", they could intrude on \"basic constitutional rights on the basis of subjective prejudices.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12-1\" id=\"fn12-1_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government admitted at oral argument in this case that the spot check does not meet Terry standards.  Accordingly, the District Court properly found that police interferences with the appellant's late night walks pursuant to a mere \"suspicion' standard were unconstitutional and the court's injunction restrained the police from stopping Gomez under the guise of either a vagrancy observation or spot check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13-1\" id=\"fn13-1_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn now to the question of remedy.  We have said that the District Court found Gomez had been the victim of unconstitutional police action.  The question that court must face on remand is whether this conduct is sufficiently widespread to sustain class action relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that we are not here faced with the mere assertion of a solitary isolated incident, as we were in Long v. District of Columbia, where the court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p>In [Gomez] there was an official, publicly adopted policy . . . under attack.  There was no question that the procedures objected to occurred regularly and would occur again in the future.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14-1\" id=\"fn14-1_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The President's 1967 Crime Commission suggested that the courts recognize \"the importance of the administrative policymaking function of [the] police\" and \"take appropriate steps to make this a process which is . . . articulate and responsive to external controls appropriate in a democratic society.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15-1\" id=\"fn15-1_ref\">15</a>  Likening the police policymaking function to that of an administrative agency, the Commission called on the courts to develop judicial remedies that would \"require the law enforcement agency to articulate its policy and to defend it, and if the challenge is successful to change the policy.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16-1\" id=\"fn16-1_ref\">16</a>  The Commission specifically referred to the need for such an articulation and review of police policies about street investigative stops.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17-1\" id=\"fn17-1_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The American Bar Association has also focused on the need for providing positive guidance to the police, \"rather than concentrating solely on penalizing improper police conduct,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18-1\" id=\"fn18-1_ref\">18</a> as by application of the exclusionary rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19-1\" id=\"fn19-1_ref\">19</a>  The ABA Report specifically approved of \"injunctive actions to terminate a pattern of unlawful conduct.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20-1\" id=\"fn20-1_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The class action injunctive suit is one means by which the police can be required to identify, articulate, and defend, as well as be afforded an opportunity to change, their official policies and practices.  The class action, by its very nature, focuses on the broad policy rather than the individual incident.  Hence, it provides the kind of positive guidance suggested by the ABA and the kind of remedy called for by the Crime Commission.  But, it can only be a workable remedy if there is not an intolerable burden on a petitioner to demonstrate the widespread scope of application of an articulated police policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21-1\" id=\"fn21-1_ref\">21</a>  It is illogical, if not irrational, to require a plaintiff to establish that the five thousand men and women of the Metropolitan Police Department are doing what they have been instructed to do.  Rather, where a petitioner shows that a police practice, as described in official communications or regulations, is unconstitutional, the burden of going forward should shift to the police on the question of whether the application of the practice is widespread.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The already lengthy history of this litigation indicates that it may yet be far from over.  As to the interim period, the record suggests the propriety of a preliminary injunction against spot checks not meeting Terry standards.  The appellant has not requested relief pendente lite; but, on remand, the District Court may properly entertain a petition for such relief.  The requirements are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>1) the party in whose favor the relief is to run must make a strong showing that he is likely to ultimately prevail on the merits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p>2) there must be a danger of irreparable injury;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>3) to be balanced against the extent to which the relief would harm the other party; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>4) the court must determine where lies the public interest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22-1\" id=\"fn22-1_ref\">22</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the likelihood of appellant's success on the merits, it is already clear that the spot check procedure does not meet the test articulated in Terry.  The issue on remand is the proper scope of relief.  The official police documents describing spot checks and the affidavits of the appellant and other citizens who have been subjected to unlawful street stops and interrogations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23-1\" id=\"fn23-1_ref\">23</a> if accurate, would support the conclusion that the spot check procedure is sufficiently widespread to justify an injunction in favor of the class suggested by appellant.  But those affidavits were not before the District Court nor were they properly before this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court should also consider to what extent its limited relief has been effective to protect the appellant. Evidence has been proffered to us that the appellant himself has been stopped twice more since the entry of that order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24-1\" id=\"fn24-1_ref\">24</a>  Thus the question arises whether the rights of appellant or any individual can be adequately protected without protecting those of the public generally.  It is hardly likely that the appellant is the only person being stopped and interrogated pursuant to the unconstitutional spot check procedures. \"[O]nce [an unconstitutional practice] is found, . . . the court must order . . . it discontinued [and its] decree may not-either expressly or impliedly-authorize [its continuation] against others.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25-1\" id=\"fn25-1_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court will also have to determine whether there is a danger of immediate and irreparable injury.  It may find that if preliminary relief is not granted, no protection will be afforded the public from these unconstitutional street stops pending this litigation<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26-1\" id=\"fn26-1_ref\">26</a>-since whatever permanent injunctive or declaratory relief is ultimately granted will have only prospective effect.  The court could thus measure the cost of its delay in terms of the infringements on the constitutional rights of all those citizens who, in the months or years before this case reaches its long overdue conclusion, will be illegally detained by the police.  The value of the resultant loss of constitutional rights is neither easily measurable nor, as a practical matter, fully compensable in dollars and cents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27-1\" id=\"fn27-1_ref\">27</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court may not ignore what might be lost by the government should a preliminary injunction issue.  Courts certainly should not involve themselves unnecessarily in police matters and should consider the degree to which proper activity and discretion may be curtailed by the preliminary relief.  But if unconstitutional street stops are widespread, the police would properly be enjoined from undertaking them at all in the future.  And if spot checks not meeting Terry standards are not widespread, what is lost by a narrowly drawn order restraining an uncommon practice?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final element to be weighed by the District Court is the public interest.  In this inquiry, I do not think the court can ignore who the appellant and his lawyer are.  The appellant is a poor man and a member of a racial minority.  The President's 1967 Crime Commission observed that police field interrogations are directed predominantly at and often conducted indiscriminately among that very class of citizens.  As a result, the Commission warned, street stops are a major source of friction between police and minority groups, creating resentment of the police in the urban ghettos.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28-1\" id=\"fn28-1_ref\">28</a>  It would surely seem in the public interest to minimize such friction by at least insuring that street stops are carried out in a way consonant with Constitutional guarantees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29-1\" id=\"fn29-1_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The guarantees of the Constitution exist for all men, rich and poor alike.  But to say that such rights exist for all men is only meaningful if both rich and poor have the means to secure them.  Since appellant is a poor man, he could not himself afford the crippling cost of this extended litigation.  He would not be before the courts today were it not for the voluntary representation of the American Civil Liberties Union, whose resources, it now appears, may be insufficient for the burdens imposed by the courts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30-1\" id=\"fn30-1_ref\">30</a>  The court has a moral as well as a legal obligation to be mindful of these matters<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31-1\" id=\"fn31-1_ref\">31</a> in considering this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nonetheless, the court today is sending appellant back to the District Court once more without meaningful relief and without any guidelines for that court's consideration of an appropriate remedy.  The court is, in effect, sending appellant back down to the bottom of the hill that he began climbing five long years ago, and instructing him to begin anew.  In my view, the District Court should be instructed on remand to consider the affidavits presented to us, as well as other matters,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32-1\" id=\"fn32-1_ref\">32</a> in accordance with some guidance from us for the determination of appropriate interim relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint in this case has been before the courts for more than five years.  The police have been defending on the ground that their spot check procedure is proper.  It may then well be that they have been engaging in that practice every day, all day long, while the complaint is unresolved.  Since we piously refrain from expediting the solution, we are part of the problem.  What credibility do we then have in urging the victims of police misconduct to rely on the courts-not on the streets-to redress their grievances?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Our earlier decisions in this case are Gomez v.

The school board, however, closed the county's public schools and refused to reopen them, and participated in a plan assisting attendance at private schools operated for white children only.  A supplemental complaint was thereafter filed in the original action charging use of state funds to support segregated schools and seeking an injunction compelling the reopening of the public schools.  In sustaining the propriety of that procedure, the Court said:</p>\n        <p>Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules . . . plainly permits supplemental amendments to cover events happening after suit, and it follows, of course, that persons participating in these new events may be added if necessary.

While agreeing that a remand is necessary, asserts that we should facilitate the completion of this litigation by offering guidance to the District Court.  Because we do not adopt the exposition the opinion makes, it accuses us of impairing the credibility of the court.  The only substantial \"guidance\" which the opinion volunteers, however, consists of a discussion of the feasibility of a preliminary injunction against spot checks pending conclusion of the remand.  We would not presume to instruct experienced counsel or a trial judge more than thirty years on the bench as to the well know criteria for granting such injunctions</p>\n        <p>Moreover, appellant already has a permanent injunction affording him individually every bit of the protection asked in his complaint, and obviously has also the prerogative of charging any violation of that injunction as a contempt of court.  To be sure, a preliminary injunction, if granted, would ban spot checks temporarily while the proceedings continue, but it would not bring about the ultimate determination on the merits any sooner.  Nor, despite the substantial amount of \"guidance\" proffered, do we find any suggestion in the separate opinion that would shorten the dispositional process one whit.

Id. at 507-508, 59 S.Ct. at 960 (opinion of Justice Roberts).  The statement has never been adopted by a majority of the Court in any subsequent case, and its efficacy became the more doubtful when the Court recently concluded that \"the dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one.\"  Lynch  v. Household Finance Corp., supra note 49, 405 U.S. at 552, 92 S.Ct. at 1122.  With the remarkable expansion of remedies in damages to enable redress of invasions of an incalculable variety of personal interests, monetary valuation of fundamental civil rights seems hardly impossible today.

As a matter of pure logic, the ability to attach a money value to a right is not necessarily the ability to assign it a value satisfying the jurisdictional requirement of Sec. 1331(a).  In Hague v. CIO, supra, three members of the Court felt that asserted rights of free speech and assembly had to meet the jurisdictional-amount test, and two others that it was impossible for them to do so. 307 U.S. at 507-508, 529-531, 532, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103226\"><a href=\"/opinion/103226/haguer-v-committee-for-industrial-organization/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>.  The continuing undifferentiated application of that test and the assimilation of personal and property rights hardly signals an imminent departure from that aspect of Hague.  See Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., supra note 49, 405 U.S. at 542, 546-552, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></span>.  On the contrary, only recently this court adhered to the Hague approach.  Tatum v. Laird, supra note 53, 144 U.S.App. D.C. at 74-76, 444 F.2d at 949-951.  So notwithstanding a deep-seated feeling that price-tagging of fundamental human rights is dangerous business, we realize that any automatic finding of the required amount in controversy just because such rights are in issue may be a more simplistic solution than Sec. 1331(a) will tolerate.  Moreover, we find it hard to believe that demonstration of jurisdictional amount is a difficult undertaking where the right asserted is truly basic.  At least for the time being, then, we will cling to the middle course which permits complainants in suits under Sec. 1331(a) for injunctive relief against federal and District officers to allege and show that the value of the rights sought to be protected exceeds the required jurisdictional amount.
