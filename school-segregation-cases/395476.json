S. District Judge for the Central District of Illinois,\nsitting by designation.\n\f      This appeal raises the question of whether a plaintiff who seeks and obtains\n\ninjunctive relief pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12201, et seq., is entitled to attorney’s fees when that relief does not benefit the\n\nplaintiff directly. William V. Barnes appeals the decision of the district court to\n\namend its initial decision to award attorney’s fees. For the reasons that follow, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly amended its original judgment, thereby\n\ndenying Barnes’ request for attorney’s fees under the ADA.\n\n\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Barnes filed this action against Ron Cochran, Sheriff of Broward County,\n\nFlorida (“the County”), alleging that the County had refused to hire him for a position\n\nas detention deputy due to a perceived disability and due to his age, in violation of the\n\nADA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 421 (“ADEA”).\n\nBarnes sought compensatory relief with respect to both the ADA and ADEA claims.\n\nIn addition, Barnes sought injunctive relief under the ADA to prohibit the County\n\nfrom maintaining its practice of conducting pre-employment psychological\n\nexaminations, to which he had been subjected as part of the job application process.\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County on Barnes’\n\ndiscrimination claims. Specifically, the court found that Barnes had “barely satisfied\n\n\n                                           2\n\fthe burden of proving his prima facie case” of discrimination under the ADA and,\n\neven assuming he had satisfied this burden, nonetheless had failed to proffer sufficient\n\nevidence to give rise to a reasonable inference that the County’s stated legitimate\n\nreasons for not hiring Barnes were pretextual. See R2-29 at 8. The court further\n\ndetermined that Barnes had failed to present “even a scintilla of evidence in his favor”\n\nwith respect to the ADEA claim. Id. With regard to Barnes’ challenge to the\n\nCounty’s use of pre-employment psychological testing, however, the court concluded\n\nthat the particular examination process employed by the County was impermissible\n\nunder the ADA. Consistent with this determination, the court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Barnes on this claim and permanently enjoined the County from\n\ncontinuing the practice of conducting pre-employment psychological or physical\n\nmedical evaluations. See id. at 15-16.\n\n      Both the County and Barnes subsequently moved for attorney’s fees. In its\n\ninitial order, the district court found that (1) because Barnes’ institution of the ADEA\n\nclaim was “without foundation,” R2-50 at 5, the County was entitled to attorney’s fees\n\non this claim, and (2) because the court had enjoined the County from further use of\n\npre-employment psychological testing as a result of Barnes’ lawsuit, Barnes had\n\neffectively prevailed on a significant issue and, therefore, also was entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees. See id. at 4.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       Both parties moved to amend the judgment. In response to these motions, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that it had erred both in characterizing Barnes as a prevailing\n\nparty and in awarding him attorney’s fees as a result of the injunctive relief ordered\n\nat the conclusion of the litigation. The court thus vacated its earlier judgment to the\n\nextent that it granted Barnes attorney’s fees, and denied Barnes’ motion to amend the\n\njudgment as to the ADEA claim. See R2-59 at 3.\n\n\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\n       We review the district court’s decision to alter or amend a judgment regarding\n\nattorney’s fees for abuse of discretion. Taylor v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 810 F.2d\n\n1551, 1556 (11th Cir. 1987). To the extent that the district court’s conclusion\n\nimplicates a question of law, we review de novo. See Preserve Endangered Areas of\n\nCobb’s History, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers, 87 F.3d 1242, 1246\n\n(11th Cir. 1996).\n\n       In Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 107 S. Ct. 2672, 96 L. Ed. 2d 654 (1987), a\n\ncase involving the plaintiff’s entitlement to attorney’s fees under 42 U.S.C. § 19881,\n\nthe Supreme Court expressly noted that\n\n       1\n          While this case involves the “prevailing party” standard under the ADA, the Court has noted\nthat its analysis of the “prevailing party” standard under section 1988 is “generally applicable in all\ncases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a ‘prevailing party.’” Hensley v.\nEckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 n.7, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939 n.7, 76 L. Ed. 2d 40 (1983).\n\n                                                  4\n\f               [t]he real value of the judicial pronouncement – what makes\n               it a proper judicial resolution of a “case or controversy”\n               rather than an advisory opinion – is in the settling of some\n               dispute which affects the behavior of the defendant towards\n               the plaintiff.\n\nId. at 761, 107 S. Ct. at 2676 (emphasis in original). Hewitt concerned a claim\n\nbrought by a prison inmate pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The inmate, Helms, alleged\n\nthat his administrative segregation and subsequent conviction for participating in a\n\nprison riot violated his right to due process. Although the Court of Appeals\n\ndetermined that Helms’ conviction constituted a violation of due process, the district\n\ncourt, on remand, found that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The\n\nSupreme Court concluded that, notwithstanding the earlier finding that Helms’\n\nconstitutional right had been violated, this “moral satisfaction,”2 id. at 762, 107 S. Ct.\n\nat 2676, without more, was not sufficient to confer on the plaintiff prevailing party\n\nstatus. Noting that, during the pendency of Helms’ lawsuit, Helms was released from\n\nprison and, at the same time, the state Bureau of Corrections revised its inmate\n\ndisciplinary proceedings, the Court observed:\n\n               When [the Bureau of Prison’s regulation] was amended,\n               Helms had long since been released from prison. Although\n\n       2\n         We recognize that, unlike the plaintiff in Hewitt, the court in this case granted a portion of\nthe relief Barnes’ sought in his complaint – that is, an injunction barring the County from continuing\nits use of psychological examinations. As we discuss further below, however, the Supreme Court\nhas suggested in broad terms that a plaintiff’s “success” in a lawsuit may not, in all instances, render\nhim a prevailing party for purposes of an attorney’s fee award.\n\n                                                   5\n\f             he has subsequently been returned to prison, and is\n             presumably now benefitting from the new procedures . . .,\n             that fortuity can hardly render him, retroactively, a\n             “prevailing party” in this lawsuit, even though he was not\n             such when the final judgment entered.\n\nId. at 763-64, 107 S. Ct. at 2677.\n\n      In Rhodes v. Stewart, 488 U.S. 1, 109 S. Ct. 202, 102 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988), the\n\nSupreme Court applied the reasoning of Hewitt in the context of prison inmates suing\n\nunder section 1983 for prison officials’ refusal to allow them to subscribe to certain\n\nmagazines. The Court acknowledged that, subsequent to the inmates’ initiation of\n\ntheir lawsuit, judgment was entered for the inmates and the prison modified its\n\nmagazine-subscription policy, but concluded that the plaintiffs nonetheless were not\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees. In reaching this determination, the Court observed that “[a]\n\nmodification of prison policies on magazine subscriptions could not in any way have\n\nbenefitted either plaintiff, one of whom was dead and the other released before the\n\nDistrict Court entered its order.” Id. at 488, 109 S. Ct. at 203.\n\n      More recently, in Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed. 2d\n\n494 (1992), the Court synthesized its jurisprudence regarding a prevailing plaintiff’s\n\nentitlement to attorney’s fees under the fee-shifting provisions of civil rights\n\nlegislation and stated:\n\n             Whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit\n             him at the time of the judgment or settlement. Otherwise\n\n                                           6\n\f              the judgment or settlement cannot be said to affect the\n              behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff. Only under\n              these circumstances can civil rights litigation effect “the\n              material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties”\n              and thereby transform the plaintiff into a prevailing party.\n              In short, a plaintiff “prevails” when actual relief on the\n              merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship\n              between the parties by modifying the defendant’s behavior\n              in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\n\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 111, 113 S. Ct. at 573 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       Our review of the foregoing decisional law convinces us that we are bound, in\n\nthis instance, to conclude that Barnes is not entitled to attorney’s fees. Despite the fact\n\nthat the court granted injunctive relief with respect to the County’s use of pre-\n\nemployment psychological testing, there is neither evidence that this change in policy\n\naffected the relationship between Barnes and the County at the time judgment was\n\nrendered, nor any indication that Barnes directly benefitted from the injunction. As\n\nalluded to by the Supreme Court in Hewitt, the fact that Barnes conceivably could\n\nbenefit from the court’s order prohibiting the referenced examinations if he ever chose\n\nin the future to re-apply to the Sheriff’s office for a job is not adequate to render him\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fa prevailing party with respect to this litigation.3 See Hewitt, 482 at 763-64, 107 S.\n\nCt. at 2677.\n\n        It is worth adding that we do not share Barnes’ interpretation of decisional law\n\nfrom this and other circuits, cited for the proposition that courts frequently do not\n\nconsider as significant or dispositive, for purposes of assessing a plaintiff’s entitlement\n\nto attorney’s fees, whether that plaintiff has received a direct legal or equitable benefit\n\nas a result of the litigation. Although Barnes is correct that these decisions do not\n\nexpressly describe or discuss the plaintiff’s legal relationship to the defendant at the\n\nconclusion of the litigation, the facts in each case indicate that such a discussion was\n\nunnecessary because the applicable court-ordered relief unambiguously and personally\n\naffected the plaintiff. See, e.g., LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 143 F.3d 748, 759 (2nd\n\nCir. 1998), (where injunctive relief prevented defendants from implementing zoning\n\n\n        3\n         We do not foreclose the possibility that an employment discrimination plaintiff who receives\nonly injunctive relief may be entitled to attorney’s fees where the plaintiff establishes that he\ncontinues to have or is reasonably likely to have some legal relationship to the defendant. We\nacknowledge that Hewitt and Rhodes cannot be applied wholesale and without limitation to every\ncivil rights case where attorney’s fees are at issue. Indeed, conferring prevailing party status on the\nprisoner-plaintiffs in Hewitt and Rhodes would require that the court inappropriately speculate that\nthe plaintiffs were likely, at some point in the future, to return to the particular prison whose policy\nwas modified by virtue of the injunctive relief and, thereby, “benefit” from the fruits of the litigation.\nIn an employment case, however, it may be possible to allege and show -- without requiring any\nspeculation by the court -- that the plaintiff retains a sufficient connection to the defendant that he\nlikely will be affected by the court’s judgment. For example, a plaintiff could demonstrate that he\nremains eligible and is likely to reapply to the employer after challenging an employment practice.\nIn this case, there is no evidence that Barnes was eligible to re-apply for the deputy position, nor\ndoes he allege that he intended to re-apply or would re-apply if the court were to bar the continued\nuse of the psychological examinations.\n\n                                                    8\n\fregulations that would impair the plaintiffs’ ability to conduct religious services,\n\nplaintiffs – members of the affected religious community – were direct beneficiaries\n\nof the defendants’ change in conduct.); Layton v. Elder, 143 F.3d 469, 470-73 (8th Cir.\n\n1998), (injunction mandating that the defendant-county make its services and programs\n\naccessible to disabled individuals effected a material change in the relationship\n\nbetween the county and the private plaintiffs, two disabled members of the\n\ncommunity.); Ensley Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Seibels, 31 F.3d 1548 (11th Cir. 1994)\n\n(class of plaintiffs comprised of current City employees entitled to attorney’s fees\n\nbased on partial success in eliminating race and gender-conscious personnel decisions\n\nregarding City’s affirmative action policies.); Ruffin v. Great Dane Trailers, 969 F.2d\n\n989 (11th Cir. 1992) (where court ordered defendant-employer to correct racist conduct\n\nat its job-site, fact that plaintiff could “now protect his rights through a civil contempt\n\nproceeding in the event that [the defendant’s] compliance with the court’s injunction\n\nis not forthcoming,” id. at 993, indicates (in the absence of any language to the\n\ncontrary) that, at the time court rendered judgment, plaintiff was still employed by\n\ndefendant.). Contrary to Barnes’ suggestion, we believe that in each of these cited\n\ncases, the plaintiff or plaintiffs were at least the partial direct beneficiaries of any\n\ninjunctive relief obtained.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f      Our determination that, under the circumstances presented in this case, Barnes\n\nis not entitled to attorney’s fees is not intended to ignore or eviscerate the continuing\n\nviability of the “private attorney general” cause of action, whereby a plaintiff – or class\n\nof plaintiffs – vindicates a constitutional or statutorily-prescribed right by bringing a\n\ncivil rights lawsuit and, as a result of that lawsuit, causes a modification of the\n\ndefendant’s behavior or policies. Indeed, the Supreme Court has expressly noted the\n\nimportance of this particular means of enforcing civil rights legislation. See, e.g.,\n\nTexas State Teachers v. Garland Indep. School Dist., 489 U.S. 782, 793 109 S. Ct.\n\n1486, 1494, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989) (“Petitioners here obtained a judgment\n\nvindicating the First Amendment rights of public employees in the workplace. . . .\n\nPetitioners have thus served the ‘private attorney general’ role which Congress meant\n\nto promote in enacting § 1988.”). As previously stated, however, the Court’s\n\napplication of its general guiding principles regarding the outer limits of prevailing\n\nparty status consistently has evinced a requirement that, to be considered a prevailing\n\nparty, a plaintiff must obtain some benefit from the defendant at the time the litigation\n\nceases.\n\n\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f      In this appeal, Barnes asks that we set aside the district court’s judgment\n\namending its original decision to grant Barnes’ request for attorney’s fees. Based on\n\nour review of binding Supreme Court precedent, we conclude that an ADA plaintiff\n\nwho obtains injunctive relief that does not directly benefit him at the time court-\n\nordered relief is imposed does not constitute a prevailing party for purposes of the\n\napplicable fee-shifting provision. We therefore determine that the district court\n\nproperly altered its initial order awarding Barnes’ attorney’s fees. Accordingly, we\n\nAFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\f",

District Judge for the Central District of Illinois,\nsitting by designation.\n\f      This appeal raises the question of whether a plaintiff who seeks and obtains\n\ninjunctive relief pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12201, et seq., is entitled to attorney’s fees when that relief does not benefit the\n\nplaintiff directly. William V. Barnes appeals the decision of the district court to\n\namend its initial decision to award attorney’s fees. For the reasons that follow, we\n\nconclude that the district court properly amended its original judgment, thereby\n\ndenying Barnes’ request for attorney’s fees under the ADA.\n\n\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Barnes filed this action against Ron Cochran, Sheriff of Broward County,\n\nFlorida (“the County”), alleging that the County had refused to hire him for a position\n\nas detention deputy due to a perceived disability and due to his age, in violation of the\n\nADA and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. § 421 (“ADEA”).\n\nBarnes sought compensatory relief with respect to both the ADA and ADEA claims.\n\nIn addition, Barnes sought injunctive relief under the ADA to prohibit the County\n\nfrom maintaining its practice of conducting pre-employment psychological\n\nexaminations, to which he had been subjected as part of the job application process.\n\n      The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the County on Barnes’\n\ndiscrimination claims. Specifically, the court found that Barnes had “barely satisfied\n\n\n                                           2\n\fthe burden of proving his prima facie case” of discrimination under the ADA and,\n\neven assuming he had satisfied this burden, nonetheless had failed to proffer sufficient\n\nevidence to give rise to a reasonable inference that the County’s stated legitimate\n\nreasons for not hiring Barnes were pretextual. See R2-29 at 8. The court further\n\ndetermined that Barnes had failed to present “even a scintilla of evidence in his favor”\n\nwith respect to the ADEA claim. Id. With regard to Barnes’ challenge to the\n\nCounty’s use of pre-employment psychological testing, however, the court concluded\n\nthat the particular examination process employed by the County was impermissible\n\nunder the ADA. Consistent with this determination, the court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Barnes on this claim and permanently enjoined the County from\n\ncontinuing the practice of conducting pre-employment psychological or physical\n\nmedical evaluations. See id. at 15-16.\n\n      Both the County and Barnes subsequently moved for attorney’s fees. In its\n\ninitial order, the district court found that (1) because Barnes’ institution of the ADEA\n\nclaim was “without foundation,” R2-50 at 5, the County was entitled to attorney’s fees\n\non this claim, and (2) because the court had enjoined the County from further use of\n\npre-employment psychological testing as a result of Barnes’ lawsuit, Barnes had\n\neffectively prevailed on a significant issue and, therefore, also was entitled to\n\nattorney’s fees. See id. at 4.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f       Both parties moved to amend the judgment. In response to these motions, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that it had erred both in characterizing Barnes as a prevailing\n\nparty and in awarding him attorney’s fees as a result of the injunctive relief ordered\n\nat the conclusion of the litigation. The court thus vacated its earlier judgment to the\n\nextent that it granted Barnes attorney’s fees, and denied Barnes’ motion to amend the\n\njudgment as to the ADEA claim. See R2-59 at 3.\n\n\n\n                                       II.

Ct. at 2676 (emphasis in original). Hewitt concerned a claim\n\nbrought by a prison inmate pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The inmate, Helms, alleged\n\nthat his administrative segregation and subsequent conviction for participating in a\n\nprison riot violated his right to due process. Although the Court of Appeals\n\ndetermined that Helms’ conviction constituted a violation of due process, the district\n\ncourt, on remand, found that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. The\n\nSupreme Court concluded that, notwithstanding the earlier finding that Helms’\n\nconstitutional right had been violated, this “moral satisfaction,”2 id. at 762, 107 S. Ct.\n\nat 2676, without more, was not sufficient to confer on the plaintiff prevailing party\n\nstatus. Noting that, during the pendency of Helms’ lawsuit, Helms was released from\n\nprison and, at the same time, the state Bureau of Corrections revised its inmate\n\ndisciplinary proceedings, the Court observed:\n\n               When [the Bureau of Prison’s regulation] was amended,\n               Helms had long since been released from prison. Although\n\n       2\n         We recognize that, unlike the plaintiff in Hewitt, the court in this case granted a portion of\nthe relief Barnes’ sought in his complaint – that is, an injunction barring the County from continuing\nits use of psychological examinations. As we discuss further below, however, the Supreme Court\nhas suggested in broad terms that a plaintiff’s “success” in a lawsuit may not, in all instances, render\nhim a prevailing party for purposes of an attorney’s fee award.\n\n                                                   5\n\f             he has subsequently been returned to prison, and is\n             presumably now benefitting from the new procedures . . .,\n             that fortuity can hardly render him, retroactively, a\n             “prevailing party” in this lawsuit, even though he was not\n             such when the final judgment entered.\n\nId. at 763-64, 107 S.

The Court acknowledged that, subsequent to the inmates’ initiation of\n\ntheir lawsuit, judgment was entered for the inmates and the prison modified its\n\nmagazine-subscription policy, but concluded that the plaintiffs nonetheless were not\n\nentitled to attorney’s fees. In reaching this determination, the Court observed that “[a]\n\nmodification of prison policies on magazine subscriptions could not in any way have\n\nbenefitted either plaintiff, one of whom was dead and the other released before the\n\nDistrict Court entered its order.” Id. at 488, 109 S. Ct. at 203.\n\n      More recently, in Farrar v. Hobby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112798\"><a href=\"/opinion/112798/farrar-v-hobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), the Court synthesized its jurisprudence regarding a prevailing plaintiff’s\n\nentitlement to attorney’s fees under the fee-shifting provisions of civil rights\n\nlegislation and stated:\n\n             Whatever relief the plaintiff secures must directly benefit\n             him at the time of the judgment or settlement. Otherwise\n\n                                           6\n\f              the judgment or settlement cannot be said to affect the\n              behavior of the defendant toward the plaintiff. Only under\n              these circumstances can civil rights litigation effect “the\n              material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties”\n              and thereby transform the plaintiff into a prevailing party.\n              In short, a plaintiff “prevails” when actual relief on the\n              merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship\n              between the parties by modifying the defendant’s behavior\n              in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.\n\nFarrar, 506 U.S. at 111, 113 S. Ct. at 573 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n       Our review of the foregoing decisional law convinces us that we are bound, in\n\nthis instance, to conclude that Barnes is not entitled to attorney’s fees. Despite the fact\n\nthat the court granted injunctive relief with respect to the County’s use of pre-\n\nemployment psychological testing, there is neither evidence that this change in policy\n\naffected the relationship between Barnes and the County at the time judgment was\n\nrendered, nor any indication that Barnes directly benefitted from the injunction. As\n\nalluded to by the Supreme Court in Hewitt, the fact that Barnes conceivably could\n\nbenefit from the court’s order prohibiting the referenced examinations if he ever chose\n\nin the future to re-apply to the Sheriff’s office for a job is not adequate to render him\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\fa prevailing party with respect to this litigation.3 See Hewitt, 482 at 763-64, 107 S.\n\nCt. at 2677.\n\n        It is worth adding that we do not share Barnes’ interpretation of decisional law\n\nfrom this and other circuits, cited for the proposition that courts frequently do not\n\nconsider as significant or dispositive, for purposes of assessing a plaintiff’s entitlement\n\nto attorney’s fees, whether that plaintiff has received a direct legal or equitable benefit\n\nas a result of the litigation. Although Barnes is correct that these decisions do not\n\nexpressly describe or discuss the plaintiff’s legal relationship to the defendant at the\n\nconclusion of the litigation, the facts in each case indicate that such a discussion was\n\nunnecessary because the applicable court-ordered relief unambiguously and personally\n\naffected the plaintiff. See, e.g., LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754226\"><a href=\"/opinion/754226/rabbi-yitzchok-leblanc-sternberg-chanie-leblanc-sternberg-fred-walfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 759 (2nd\n\nCir. 1998), (where injunctive relief prevented defendants from implementing zoning\n\n\n        3\n         We do not foreclose the possibility that an employment discrimination plaintiff who receives\nonly injunctive relief may be entitled to attorney’s fees where the plaintiff establishes that he\ncontinues to have or is reasonably likely to have some legal relationship to the defendant. We\nacknowledge that Hewitt and Rhodes cannot be applied wholesale and without limitation to every\ncivil rights case where attorney’s fees are at issue. Indeed, conferring prevailing party status on the\nprisoner-plaintiffs in Hewitt and Rhodes would require that the court inappropriately speculate that\nthe plaintiffs were likely, at some point in the future, to return to the particular prison whose policy\nwas modified by virtue of the injunctive relief and, thereby, “benefit” from the fruits of the litigation.\nIn an employment case, however, it may be possible to allege and show -- without requiring any\nspeculation by the court -- that the plaintiff retains a sufficient connection to the defendant that he\nlikely will be affected by the court’s judgment. For example, a plaintiff could demonstrate that he\nremains eligible and is likely to reapply to the employer after challenging an employment practice.\nIn this case, there is no evidence that Barnes was eligible to re-apply for the deputy position, nor\ndoes he allege that he intended to re-apply or would re-apply if the court were to bar the continued\nuse of the psychological examinations.\n\n                                                    8\n\fregulations that would impair the plaintiffs’ ability to conduct religious services,\n\nplaintiffs – members of the affected religious community – were direct beneficiaries\n\nof the defendants’ change in conduct.); Layton v.
