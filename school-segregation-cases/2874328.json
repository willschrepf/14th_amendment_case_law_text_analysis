BURNS, United States\n     District Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting\n     by designation.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fresponsible for the Arkansas public education system.            Edgerson asserted\nthe defendants intentionally caused the school districts to become racially\nsegregated, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection\nClause and 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, and 2000(d).           See Brown v. Board of\nEduc.,    347 U.S. 483, 495 (1954).             As a remedy, Edgerson requested\nconsolidation of some of the districts, or the creation of magnet schools\nand other programs to improve the racial balance among the districts and\neliminate racial disparities.        Each defendant filed cross-claims asserting\nthat if segregation had occurred, the other defendants were to blame.\nFollowing a bench trial, the district court entered judgment for the\ndefendants on Edgerson's claim, and dismissed the cross-claims.            Edgerson\nappeals, and the Grady School District appeals the dismissal of its cross-\nclaims.    We affirm.\n\n\n        As an initial matter, we deny the Dumas School District's motion\nseeking dismissal from this appeal.        Contrary to Dumas's view, Edgerson's\nfailure to name Dumas as an appellee in her notice of appeal did not\nviolate Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c).           Thomas v. Gunter, 32\nF.3d 1258, 1262 (8th Cir. 1994).        Finding no procedural error, we turn to\nthe merits.\n\n\n        Most of the relevant facts are undisputed.      During the first half of\nthis century, each school district in this appeal operated one school\nsystem for white students and a separate school system for black students,\nas Arkansas law required.       Ark. Stat. Ann. § 80-509(c) (1980) (repealed\n1983).    After the United States Supreme Court rejected the \"separate but\nequal\" doctrine in 1954, see Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. at 495, the\nState     of   Arkansas   actively    opposed    desegregation   and   delayed   the\nelimination of the dual school system for many years.        The school districts\nfinally merged their black and white schools during the late 1960s and\nearly 1970s.     Since then, the Gould and Grady districts have had a large\nmajority of black students.          The Dumas district is also predominantly\nblack, but to a lesser extent than Gould or Grady,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fand Star City is a mostly white district.\n\n\n     Arkansas has several laws that allow students to attend school\noutside the districts where they reside.       One of the laws, known as the\nSibling Act, was passed in 1983.     The Sibling Act permits students who were\nattending school outside their resident district during the 1982-83 or\n1983-84 school years, and all of the students' current or future siblings,\nto continue attending the same school.       Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-205(a)(1)\n(Michie 1993).      Arkansas also has a statute that permits students to\ntransfer from their resident school district to a different district with\nthe consent of both districts and the county school board (the transfer\nstatute).     Id. § 6-18-316.   In 1987, the Arkansas Legislature limited the\nuse of the transfer statute by prohibiting transfers that adversely affect\nthe racial balance in a school district that is or has been under a court\ndesegregation order.      Id. § 6-18-317.    Both Gould and Grady have been\nsubject to desegregation orders in the past.     Raney v. Board of Educ., 391\nU.S. 443, 447-48 (1968) (Gould);     Carthan v. Board of Educ., No. PB 68-C-35\n(E.D. Ark. filed Apr. 20, 1971) (unpublished consent decree) (Grady).\n\n\n     Before the 1987 restriction on transfers, all four school districts\nand the Lincoln County Board of Education routinely granted transfer\napplications.     Between 1971 and 1985, 84 students transferred from Grady\nto Star City;     27 students transferred from Gould to Star City;    and 100\ntransferred from Gould to Dumas.       Over 90% of the transferring students\nwere white.    Gould and Grady stopped granting transfers in 1987.   The State\nBoard of Education later asked Gould and Grady to review the transfers\ngranted in earlier years because the transfers might have upset the\ndistricts' racial balance.        In response, Gould and Grady revoked all\ntransfers effective 1991.       For reasons that are disputed, not all of the\ntransfer students from Grady returned to the Grady schools.       In addition\nto the transfers, students covered by the Sibling Act have attended school\noutside their resident districts as a matter of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fright, usually without leaving any record that they were attending under\nthe Sibling Act.\n\n\n       From the 1979-80 school year to the 1991-92 school year, the student\npopulation of Gould dwindled from 495 students to 357.                    The racial\ncomposition of the school system changed from 80% black and 20% white to\nabout 97% black and 3% white.           Grady's total enrollment dropped from 540\nto 360 students over the same period, and the racial composition changed\nfrom 76% black and 24% white to about 87% black and 13% white.            The change\nin the black-white student ratio can be attributed in part to transfers of\nwhite students.     Also, some white families moved out of the Gould and Grady\ndistricts during this period.      The loss in student enrollment caused a loss\nof state education funds.         In fact, the Gould and Grady districts are\nbarely financially viable, and state evaluations of the school districts\nshow student academic achievement is markedly lower in the Gould and Grady\ndistricts than in Star City and Dumas.\n\n\n       Based on these facts, Edgerson contends the Lincoln County schools\nhave become resegregated and the community perceives Gould and Grady as\n\"black districts\" neighbored by much \"whiter\" districts, Star City and\nDumas.    See United States v. Lowndes County Bd. of Educ., 878 F.2d 1301,\n1305 (11th Cir. 1989).        Edgerson claims the state officials and school\ndistricts    promoted     resegregation     by   permitting   or   encouraging   white\nstudents from the Gould and Grady districts to attend the Star City or\nDumas schools under the transfer statute and the Sibling Act.               Edgerson\nalso     contends   the   Star   City    district    encouraged    resegregation    by\ndiscriminating against black students, and state officials failed to remedy\ncounty-wide racial disparities and the serious educational deficiencies at\nthe Gould and Grady schools.\n\n\n       The parties agree on the applicable law.        Brown v. Board of Education\nestablished that \"in the field of public education the\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fdoctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.                       Separate educational\nfacilities [based on race] are inherently unequal.\"                      347 U.S. at 495.\nAccordingly, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits\nstates from mandating or deliberately maintaining segregated schools.\nMilliken v. Bradley, 418 U.S. 717, 737 (1974).                       States that operated\nsegregated schools in the past must take necessary steps to eliminate\nsegregation \"root and branch.\"         Columbus Bd. of Educ. v. Penick, 443 U.S.\n449, 459 (1979) (quoting Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 438\n(1968)).\n\n\n     To prove an Equal Protection violation, Edgerson must show the state\nand local officials acted with a discriminatory purpose.                 Little Rock Sch.\nDist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 778 F.2d 404, 410 (8th\nCir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1186 (1986).                      Because Edgerson is\nseeking an interdistrict remedy (consolidation or an interdistrict magnet\nschool plan), she also must show \"there has been a constitutional violation\nwithin one district that produces a significant segregative effect in\nanother district.        Specifically, [Edgerson must show] that racially\ndiscriminatory acts of the state or local school districts, or of a single\nschool     district    have   been     a     substantial       cause    of    interdistrict\nsegregation.\"    Milliken, 418 U.S. at 745;            Missouri v. Jenkins, 115 S. Ct.\n2038, 2050-52 (1995).      Unlike cases involving segregation within a single\nschool district, there is no presumption that racial imbalances among\nseparate,    independent      school       districts    were    caused       by   intentional\ndiscrimination.       Jenkins v. Missouri, 807 F.2d 657, 670 (8th Cir. 1986),\ncert. denied, 484 U.S. 816 (1987).             Rather, Edgerson must present clear\nproof of an interdistrict violation and clearly explain the extent of the\ninterdistrict effects.        Id. at 666.       Also, Edgerson must demonstrate the\ninterdistrict segregative effects are current.                 Id.     \"Federal courts may\nnot . . . fashion a remedy to correct a condition unless it currently\noffends the Constitution.\"       Id.\n\n\n     The district court concluded the state and local officials'\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\factions did not have a significant interdistrict effect because the\ndecrease in Gould and Grady's white enrollment was mainly a result of\ndemographic changes.       Also, the district court found the challenged actions\nhad no current segregative effect, because at the time of trial there were\nno transfers that were negatively affecting the districts' racial balance.\nEdgerson challenges these findings and conclusions.              Because the district\ncourt's finding of no current segregative effect is not clearly erroneous,\nsee Little Rock Sch. Dist., 778 F.2d at 410-11, we affirm.\n\n\n        The record supports the district court's finding that the transfer\npolicies were not negatively affecting the districts' racial balance at the\ntime of trial, and thus had no current segregative effect.                     The record\nshows that since 1987, Arkansas law has prohibited transfers that would\nnegatively affect the racial balance in the Gould and Grady districts, and\nthose districts have refused to grant transfers.                 Gould and Grady also\nrevoked all past transfers effective 1991.             Although some of the transfer\nstudents from Grady never returned, there was evidence that no transfer\nstudents were still attending the Star City or Dumas schools at the time\nof trial.      For example, the Star City superintendent testified that by\n1993,    there were no transfer students in his district.                      The Dumas\nsuperintendent testified there were about thirty transfer students at Dumas\nwhen Gould and Grady revoked the transfers, but after Dumas officials\nnotified    the   students    about    the     revocation,   some   of   the     students\nestablished legal residence in Dumas or left the district, and the\nsuperintendent refused to re-enroll a few students he identified as\nnonresidents.     The superintendent believed all the former transfer students\nattending the Dumas schools at the time of trial were lawfully attending\nin Dumas.   As far as the Sibling Act is concerned, there was testimony that\nonly nine white students attended the Star City schools under the Sibling\nAct   during    1992-93,    and   by   the   1993-94    school   year,   all    nine   had\nestablished legal residence in Star City or were no longer attending school\nthere.    There were only two white families\n\n\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fattending the Dumas schools based on the Sibling Act.\n\n\n       Despite the district court's repeated requests for specific proof,\nEdgerson's witnesses were not able to identify any other students who\nresided in the Gould or Grady districts and were still attending the Star\nCity   or   Dumas   schools   based   on     the   challenged    transfer   policies.\nEdgerson's witnesses pointed to lists of students who had been covered by\nthe Sibling Act or had been granted legal transfers at one time, but the\ndefendants   presented   evidence     that    most   of   the   listed   students   had\ngraduated, stopped attending, established residence in Star City or Dumas,\nor were lawfully attending the Star City and Dumas schools based on state\nstatutes not involved in this case.          On this record, the district court's\nfinding of no current segregative effect is well supported.\n\n\n       Edgerson contends that even if there are currently no student\ntransfers that are negatively affecting the schools' racial balance, the\ntransfer policies caused other current segregative effects in the Gould and\nGrady districts.      Specifically, Edgerson claims the transfer policies\ncreated a continuing community perception that Gould and Grady are strictly\nblack school districts and that Star City and Dumas are havens for white\nstudents.     Relying on expert testimony presented at trial, Edgerson\npredicts white families will move out of the Gould and Grady districts,\ncausing the local schools to lose more students and resources.                 No one\ndisputes the white population in Gould and Grady is decreasing, but\nEdgerson did not show any specific individuals had moved or decided to move\nbecause of the transfer policies.      Further, there is evidence in the record\nthat Gould and Grady's declining agrarian economy offers limited job\nopportunities and some residents are moving away for this reason.                   The\nrecord also shows that before the Sibling Act and the transfer statute ever\ncame into use, Gould and Grady were predominantly black districts and some\nwhite residents were threatening to move rather than send their children\nto school there.    Looking at this mix of factors, the district court could\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\freasonably conclude the transfer policies were not causing white flight.\nDistrict courts are \"`uniquely situated . . . to appraise the societal\nforces at work in the communities were they sit.'\"         Little Rock Sch. Dist.,\n778 F.2d at 411 (quoting Columbus Bd. of Educ., 443 U.S. at 470 (Stewart,\nJ., concurring)).\n\n\n        Edgerson also claims the district court ignored her contentions that\nthe Star City School District discriminates against black students and that\nstate officials have not taken adequate steps to improve black student\nperformance and the quality of education in Gould and Grady.          Although the\ndistrict court did not discuss these contentions at length, we think the\ndistrict court considered the contentions because the district court\nspecifically mentioned them in its order.             According to Edgerson, Star\nCity's discrimination and the state officials' inaction are causing out-of-\ndistrict attendance and white flight, but as we have already discussed, the\ndistrict court was entitled to take a different view of the evidence.              We\nare not holding that state officials may turn a blind eye to any lingering\neffects of the past, state-mandated dual school system within individual\nschool districts.        We are simply saying that the remedy must fit the wrong.\nUnder Milliken, we cannot order interdistrict relief without a showing of\ninterdistrict segregation.         418 U.S. at 745.\n\n\n        In conclusion, because the district court properly found the alleged\nconstitutional violations are not currently causing racial segregation\namong     the   school    districts,   the   court   correctly   refused   to   order\nconsolidation or an interdistrict magnet school plan.               We affirm the\ndistrict court's denial of Edgerson's claim and dismissal of the cross-\nclaims.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -11-\n\f",

As a remedy, Edgerson requested\nconsolidation of some of the districts, or the creation of magnet schools\nand other programs to improve the racial balance among the districts and\neliminate racial disparities.

Finding no procedural error, we turn to\nthe merits.\n\n\n        Most of the relevant facts are undisputed.      During the first half of\nthis century, each school district in this appeal operated one school\nsystem for white students and a separate school system for black students,\nas Arkansas law required.       Ark. Stat. Ann. § 80-509(c) (1980) (repealed\n1983).    After the United States Supreme Court rejected the \"separate but\nequal\" doctrine in 1954, see Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. at 495, the\nState     of   Arkansas   actively    opposed    desegregation   and   delayed   the\nelimination of the dual school system for many years.        The school districts\nfinally merged their black and white schools during the late 1960s and\nearly 1970s.     Since then, the Gould and Grady districts have had a large\nmajority of black students.          The Dumas district is also predominantly\nblack, but to a lesser extent than Gould or Grady,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fand Star City is a mostly white district.\n\n\n     Arkansas has several laws that allow students to attend school\noutside the districts where they reside.       One of the laws, known as the\nSibling Act, was passed in 1983.     The Sibling Act permits students who were\nattending school outside their resident district during the 1982-83 or\n1983-84 school years, and all of the students' current or future siblings,\nto continue attending the same school.       Ark. Code Ann. § 6-18-205(a)(1)\n(Michie 1993).      Arkansas also has a statute that permits students to\ntransfer from their resident school district to a different district with\nthe consent of both districts and the county school board (the transfer\nstatute).     Id. § 6-18-316.   In 1987, the Arkansas Legislature limited the\nuse of the transfer statute by prohibiting transfers that adversely affect\nthe racial balance in a school district that is or has been under a court\ndesegregation order.      Id. § 6-18-317.    Both Gould and Grady have been\nsubject to desegregation orders in the past.     Raney v.

Board of Educ., No. PB 68-C-35\n(E.D. Ark. filed Apr. 20, 1971) (unpublished consent decree) (Grady).\n\n\n     Before the 1987 restriction on transfers, all four school districts\nand the Lincoln County Board of Education routinely granted transfer\napplications.     Between 1971 and 1985, 84 students transferred from Grady\nto Star City;     27 students transferred from Gould to Star City;    and 100\ntransferred from Gould to Dumas.       Over 90% of the transferring students\nwere white.    Gould and Grady stopped granting transfers in 1987.   The State\nBoard of Education later asked Gould and Grady to review the transfers\ngranted in earlier years because the transfers might have upset the\ndistricts' racial balance.        In response, Gould and Grady revoked all\ntransfers effective 1991.       For reasons that are disputed, not all of the\ntransfer students from Grady returned to the Grady schools.       In addition\nto the transfers, students covered by the Sibling Act have attended school\noutside their resident districts as a matter of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fright, usually without leaving any record that they were attending under\nthe Sibling Act.\n\n\n       From the 1979-80 school year to the 1991-92 school year, the student\npopulation of Gould dwindled from 495 students to 357.                    The racial\ncomposition of the school system changed from 80% black and 20% white to\nabout 97% black and 3% white.           Grady's total enrollment dropped from 540\nto 360 students over the same period, and the racial composition changed\nfrom 76% black and 24% white to about 87% black and 13% white.            The change\nin the black-white student ratio can be attributed in part to transfers of\nwhite students.     Also, some white families moved out of the Gould and Grady\ndistricts during this period.      The loss in student enrollment caused a loss\nof state education funds.         In fact, the Gould and Grady districts are\nbarely financially viable, and state evaluations of the school districts\nshow student academic achievement is markedly lower in the Gould and Grady\ndistricts than in Star City and Dumas.\n\n\n       Based on these facts, Edgerson contends the Lincoln County schools\nhave become resegregated and the community perceives Gould and Grady as\n\"black districts\" neighbored by much \"whiter\" districts, Star City and\nDumas.    See United States v. Lowndes County Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525680\"><a href=\"/opinion/525680/united-states-of-america-national-education-association-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1305 (11th Cir. 1989).        Edgerson claims the state officials and school\ndistricts    promoted     resegregation     by   permitting   or   encouraging   white\nstudents from the Gould and Grady districts to attend the Star City or\nDumas schools under the transfer statute and the Sibling Act.               Edgerson\nalso     contends   the   Star   City    district    encouraged    resegregation    by\ndiscriminating against black students, and state officials failed to remedy\ncounty-wide racial disparities and the serious educational deficiencies at\nthe Gould and Grady schools.\n\n\n       The parties agree on the applicable law.        Brown v. Board of Education\nestablished that \"in the field of public education the\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fdoctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.

Unlike cases involving segregation within a single\nschool district, there is no presumption that racial imbalances among\nseparate,    independent      school       districts    were    caused       by   intentional\ndiscrimination.

Rather, Edgerson must present clear\nproof of an interdistrict violation and clearly explain the extent of the\ninterdistrict effects.        Id. at 666.       Also, Edgerson must demonstrate the\ninterdistrict segregative effects are current.                 Id.     \"Federal courts may\nnot . . . fashion a remedy to correct a condition unless it currently\noffends the Constitution.\"       Id.\n\n\n     The district court concluded the state and local officials'\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\factions did not have a significant interdistrict effect because the\ndecrease in Gould and Grady's white enrollment was mainly a result of\ndemographic changes.       Also, the district court found the challenged actions\nhad no current segregative effect, because at the time of trial there were\nno transfers that were negatively affecting the districts' racial balance.\nEdgerson challenges these findings and conclusions.              Because the district\ncourt's finding of no current segregative effect is not clearly erroneous,\nsee Little Rock Sch. Dist., 778 F.2d at 410-11, we affirm.\n\n\n        The record supports the district court's finding that the transfer\npolicies were not negatively affecting the districts' racial balance at the\ntime of trial, and thus had no current segregative effect.                     The record\nshows that since 1987, Arkansas law has prohibited transfers that would\nnegatively affect the racial balance in the Gould and Grady districts, and\nthose districts have refused to grant transfers.                 Gould and Grady also\nrevoked all past transfers effective 1991.             Although some of the transfer\nstudents from Grady never returned, there was evidence that no transfer\nstudents were still attending the Star City or Dumas schools at the time\nof trial.      For example, the Star City superintendent testified that by\n1993,    there were no transfer students in his district.                      The Dumas\nsuperintendent testified there were about thirty transfer students at Dumas\nwhen Gould and Grady revoked the transfers, but after Dumas officials\nnotified    the   students    about    the     revocation,   some   of   the     students\nestablished legal residence in Dumas or left the district, and the\nsuperintendent refused to re-enroll a few students he identified as\nnonresidents.     The superintendent believed all the former transfer students\nattending the Dumas schools at the time of trial were lawfully attending\nin Dumas.   As far as the Sibling Act is concerned, there was testimony that\nonly nine white students attended the Star City schools under the Sibling\nAct   during    1992-93,    and   by   the   1993-94    school   year,   all    nine   had\nestablished legal residence in Star City or were no longer attending school\nthere.    There were only two white families\n\n\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\fattending the Dumas schools based on the Sibling Act.\n\n\n       Despite the district court's repeated requests for specific proof,\nEdgerson's witnesses were not able to identify any other students who\nresided in the Gould or Grady districts and were still attending the Star\nCity   or   Dumas   schools   based   on     the   challenged    transfer   policies.\nEdgerson's witnesses pointed to lists of students who had been covered by\nthe Sibling Act or had been granted legal transfers at one time, but the\ndefendants   presented   evidence     that    most   of   the   listed   students   had\ngraduated, stopped attending, established residence in Star City or Dumas,\nor were lawfully attending the Star City and Dumas schools based on state\nstatutes not involved in this case.          On this record, the district court's\nfinding of no current segregative effect is well supported.\n\n\n       Edgerson contends that even if there are currently no student\ntransfers that are negatively affecting the schools' racial balance, the\ntransfer policies caused other current segregative effects in the Gould and\nGrady districts.      Specifically, Edgerson claims the transfer policies\ncreated a continuing community perception that Gould and Grady are strictly\nblack school districts and that Star City and Dumas are havens for white\nstudents.     Relying on expert testimony presented at trial, Edgerson\npredicts white families will move out of the Gould and Grady districts,\ncausing the local schools to lose more students and resources.                 No one\ndisputes the white population in Gould and Grady is decreasing, but\nEdgerson did not show any specific individuals had moved or decided to move\nbecause of the transfer policies.      Further, there is evidence in the record\nthat Gould and Grady's declining agrarian economy offers limited job\nopportunities and some residents are moving away for this reason.                   The\nrecord also shows that before the Sibling Act and the transfer statute ever\ncame into use, Gould and Grady were predominantly black districts and some\nwhite residents were threatening to move rather than send their children\nto school there.    Looking at this mix of factors, the district court could\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\freasonably conclude the transfer policies were not causing white flight.\nDistrict courts are \"`uniquely situated . . . to appraise the societal\nforces at work in the communities were they sit.'\"         Little Rock Sch. Dist.,\n778 F.2d at 411 (quoting Columbus Bd. of Educ., 443 U.S. at 470 (Stewart,\nJ., concurring)).\n\n\n        Edgerson also claims the district court ignored her contentions that\nthe Star City School District discriminates against black students and that\nstate officials have not taken adequate steps to improve black student\nperformance and the quality of education in Gould and Grady.          Although the\ndistrict court did not discuss these contentions at length, we think the\ndistrict court considered the contentions because the district court\nspecifically mentioned them in its order.             According to Edgerson, Star\nCity's discrimination and the state officials' inaction are causing out-of-\ndistrict attendance and white flight, but as we have already discussed, the\ndistrict court was entitled to take a different view of the evidence.              We\nare not holding that state officials may turn a blind eye to any lingering\neffects of the past, state-mandated dual school system within individual\nschool districts.        We are simply saying that the remedy must fit the wrong.\nUnder Milliken, we cannot order interdistrict relief without a showing of\ninterdistrict segregation.         418 U.S. at 745.\n\n\n        In conclusion, because the district court properly found the alleged\nconstitutional violations are not currently causing racial segregation\namong     the   school    districts,   the   court   correctly   refused   to   order\nconsolidation or an interdistrict magnet school plan.               We affirm the\ndistrict court's denial of Edgerson's claim and dismissal of the cross-\nclaims.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fA true copy.\n\n\n     Attest:\n\n\n           CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                            -11-\n\f</pre>",
