We will vacate the order and remand for further proceedings.\n\n       Jacobs filed a complaint alleging unlawful seizure and destruction of some of his\n\nlegal papers, defamation of character, conspiracy, retaliation, discrimination,\n\nunconstitutional interference with access to courts, denial of due process, and maintaining\n\nfalse business records based on incidents occurring when he was an inmate at SCI-\n\nPittsburgh (he has since been transferred). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n1291. We exercise plenary review of the District Court’s dismissal of Jacobs’ complaint\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Gary v. Air Group, Inc., 397 F.3d 183, 186 (3d Cir.\n\n2005). Because we are reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true all\n\nfactual allegations in the complaint and view them in the light most favorable to Jacobs.\n\nDoug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., 232 F.3d 173, 183 (3d Cir. 2000). We will\n\naffirm only if it appears no relief can be granted under any set of facts the plaintiff could\n\nprove. Alston v. Parker, 363 F.3d 229, 232-33 (3d Cir. 2004).\n\n       Jacobs’ complaint was based primarily on two incidents. On September 15, 2003,\n\ninmate Eric Lyons was leaving the prison library. Officer Chirico searched him, and\n\n                                              2\n\f“found 151 pages of legal work belonging to Jacobs.” See Misconduct Report A469502\n\n(against Lyons), attached to complaint. Chirico accused Lyons of lying and saying the\n\nmaterials were his, and told him he was violating prison policy by possessing another\n\ninmate’s legal work when he was not “recognized as a legal aid.” Id. According to\n\nLyons’ affidavit, attached to Jacobs’ complaint, the 151 pages were sent to the Security\n\nOffice. Lyons complained to Lt. Giddens, a shift supervisor, who said he would look into\n\nit. According to Lyons, Giddens later came to his cell and said “he would have been a\n\nfool to return the legal materials to Mr. Jacobs,” because “his name was listed on a\n\nseparate planned civil action and that he anticipated that all the materials will likely be\n\ndestroyed.” Jacobs filed a grievance complaining about the seizure of his documents,\n\nnoting Giddens’ statement that he would have been a fool to return the documents, and\n\ndisputed whether the prison could legally have a policy prohibiting other inmates from\n\nassisting with legal matters. See Grievance No. 63417, attached to the complaint. The\n\ninitial review response (which was performed by Lt. Giddens) stated that only two pages\n\nof Jacobs’ documents had been seized, and stated that his “claim of 151 pages is an\n\noutright fabrication and subject to a misconduct for lying,” even though Chirico himself\n\nhad stated in his report that he had seized 151 pages of documents belonging to Jacobs.\n\nOn appeal, Superintendent Stickman agreed that only two pages had been seized and\n\nstated that they would not be returned because they were considered contraband. The\n\nChief Grievance Officer affirmed on final review, stating that the legal materials were\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fproperly confiscated because they were in the possession of another inmate.\n\n       Jacobs also alleged that on September 16, 2003 (the day after documents were\n\nseized from Lyons), Jacobs’ cell was searched, and additional legal documents were\n\nconfiscated from him; i.e., two declarations that had been executed by inmate Gary\n\nBanks, which Jacobs had planned to attach to his legal filings. Jacobs alleged that Lt.\n\nGiddens threatened Banks with bodily harm if he continued to help Jacobs in his legal\n\nendeavors. (An affidavit by Banks attesting to the same is attached to Jacobs’ complaint).\n\nJacobs was charged with refusing an order, possession of contraband and loaning or\n\nborrowing property. The disciplinary hearing report is largely illegible, but it appears he\n\nwas found guilty of the latter two offenses, and was sanctioned with 30 days of\n\ndisciplinary confinement. The misconduct was affirmed by the Program Review\n\nCommittee and on second level appeal and final review.\n\n       After Jacobs filed his complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Magistrate Judge recommended that it be granted, citing\n\nHudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984), because “the Fourth Amendment right to be free\n\nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures is inconsistent within the prison environment.”\n\nThe Report further recommended dismissing the retaliation claim because “the conduct of\n\nwhich the plaintiff complains was not constitutionally protected,” and even if it was, “he\n\nhas failed to set forth any bases upon which one might conclude that he suffered ‘adverse\n\naction’ as a result of the conduct about which he complains.” The Report also notes that\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fJacobs “knew that prison policy bans inmates from possessing legal materials belonging\n\nto another inmate.” The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in a one-\n\npage order.\n\n       Accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable\n\ninferences that can be drawn therefrom, as we must, see Nami v. Fauver, 82 F. 3d 63, 65\n\n(3d Cir. 1996); we find that Jacobs’ allegations regarding retaliation are sufficient to\n\nsurvive § 12(b)(6) dismissal. To show that prison officials retaliated against a prisoner for\n\nexercising his constitutional rights, the prisoner must plead three elements: 1) the\n\nconduct in which he was engaged was constitutionally protected; 2) he suffered “adverse\n\naction” at the hands of prison officials; and 3) his constitutionally protected conduct was\n\na substantial or motivating factor in the decision to discipline him. Rauser v. Horn, 241\n\nF.3d 330, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). Once he has made his prima facie case, the burden shifts\n\nto the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it “would have made\n\nthe same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to\n\npenological interest.” Carter v. McGrady, 292 F.3d 152, 158 (3d Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted).\n\n       Here, the District Court stated, without explaining, that “the conduct of which the\n\nplaintiff complains was not constitutionally protected.” Report and Recommendation at\n\n3. The Court may have believed that Jacobs was asserting a right to possess the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f    materials of other inmates.1   We believe Jacobs was asserting a broader right; that of\n\n    access to the courts, which is constitutionally protected. Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343,\n\n    355 (1996).\n\n           We also believe that Jacobs sufficiently pled the second element; adverse action.\n\n    Jacobs alleged that as a result of the seizure of his legal materials, he lost parties from a\n\n    lawsuit, he was prevented from pursuing certain claims and he was given a disciplinary\n\n    sanction of segregation. Of course, to win a retaliation claim, the plaintiff must show that\n\n    the adverse action was “sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising\n\n    his First Amendment rights.” Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 224-25 (3d Cir. 2000)\n\n    (internal quotation and citation omitted). However, “unless the claimed retaliatory action\n\n    is truly ‘inconsequential,’ the plaintiff’s claim should go to the jury.” Bell v. Johnson,\n\n    308 F.3d 594, 603 (6 th Cir. 2002). We find that Jacobs’ allegations are not\n\n    inconsequential.\n\n           As to the third element, Jacobs presented evidence that the seizure of his\n\n    documents may have been motivated by his prior grievances filed against prison officials,\n\n    and by a desire to prevent him from filing a lawsuit in the future. In particular, Jacobs’\n\n       1\n1        To the extent Jacobs argues that prisoners have a right to assist each other on legal\n2   matters, the Supreme Court has held that prisons may, if consistent with Turner v. Safely,\n3   482 U.S. 72 (1987), restrict inmates from assisting other inmates in legal matters. Shaw\n4   v. Murphy, 532 U.S. 223 (2001). Although the prison policy Jacobs cites as support for\n5   his position (DC-ADM 007) does not expressly prohibit one inmate from aiding another\n6   inmate, it does provide for official “Inmate Legal Reference Aides” and also provides that\n7   such Aides may not assist LTSU inmates (Jacobs was in LTSU at the time of the\n8   incidents complained of ). This is similar to the policy upheld in Shaw.\n\n                                                   6\n\fcomplaint states, inter alia, that “[a]mongst the materials seized from Mr. Lyons was an\n\nanticipated lawsuit in which defendants Giddens, Stickman and Scire were all named as\n\ndefendants,” Complaint at ¶ 38; that Giddens admitted to inmate Banks that he “would be\n\na fool to return the legal materials” because he was named as a defendant in the papers,\n\nComplaint at ¶ 39 and Exhibit A; and that after reading the affidavits that inmate Banks\n\nhad prepared for Jacobs, “Giddens threatened Mr. Banks with bodily harm if he continued\n\nto assist Plaintiff in his legal endeavors against D.O.C. officials,” Complaint at ¶ 50. All\n\nof these allegations, taken as true, tend to show that the prison officials may have had a\n\nretaliatory motive in seizing Jacobs’ documents.\n\n       As noted previously, if a prisoner establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nburden then shifts to the defendants to show that they would have taken the same action\n\nabsent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to penological interest.\n\nDefendants argue that because the legal documents were “contraband,” the documents\n\nwere taken for a legitimate penological reason. We can understand that in the case of the\n\ndocuments seized from inmate Lyons, the prison might choose to categorize the\n\ndocuments as “contraband” in the hands of Lyons, but it does not necessarily follow that\n\nthe documents should be destroyed, rather than returned to their owner. Indeed, when\n\nJacobs filed a grievance concerning those documents, a staff member responded that he\n\nwould “review the matter with Lt. Giddens, and, if appropriate, the items will be returned\n\nto you.” A jury could infer that only after Giddens determined that the papers included a\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fplanned lawsuit against him did he decide that the papers should be destroyed as\n\n“contraband.” In the case of the documents seized from Jacobs’ cell, it is not clear that\n\nthe prison could legitimately categorize the documents as “contraband,” if they were, as\n\nJacobs alleges, affidavits that inmate Banks prepared for use in Jacobs’ lawsuit. An\n\naffidavit must be prepared by the person having knowledge of the facts asserted therein.\n\nThus, they are in a different category from legal research or legal filings prepared by one\n\nprisoner for another. It is difficult to imagine what the prison’s legitimate penological\n\ninterest would be in seizing and destroying the affidavits, absent any retaliatory motive.\n\nBecause Jacobs’ complaint states a prima facie case for retaliation, that claim should not\n\nhave been dismissed.\n\n       Jacobs also appears to allege that the seizure and destruction of his documents\n\nviolated his First Amendment right of access to the courts. An inmate who alleges a\n\nviolation of the right of access to the courts must show an actual injury. Lewis v. Casey,\n\n518 U.S. 343, 350 (1996). Actual injury can be demonstrated by showing that the\n\ndefendants’ actions resulted in the “loss or rejection of a legal claim.” Oliver v. Fauver,\n\n118 F.3d 175, 177 (3d Cir.1997). The underlying lost or rejected legal claim must be\n\nspecifically identified and meritorious. Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 414\n\n(2002). As noted above, Jacobs alleged that because his legal documents were seized, he\n\nlost parties from a lawsuit and was prevented from pursuing certain claims. These\n\nallegations are not sufficiently specific to state a claim. However, when a district court\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f    determines that a complaint is vulnerable to 12(b)(6) dismissal, the court must permit a\n\n    curative amendment, regardless of whether the plaintiff seeks leave to amend, unless an\n\n    amendment would be inequitable or futile. Alston, 363 F.3d at 235-36 (citing Grayson v.\n\n    Mayview State Hosp., 293 F.3d 103, 108 (3d Cir. 2002)). It appears the District Court\n\n    did not provide Jacobs with this opportunity. See Shane v. Fauver, 213 F.3d 113, 116 (3d\n\n    Cir. 2000) (suggesting that “district judges expressly state . . . that the plaintiff has leave\n\n    to amend within a specified period of time”).\n\n           We express no opinion on the other legal claims raised in Jacobs’ complaint, as the\n\n    District Court did not address them. We will allow the District Court to determine in the\n\n    first instance, after giving Jacobs an opportunity to amend his complaint, whether such\n\n    claims survive dismissal.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the order of the District Court and\n\n    remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n1       Although we denied Jacobs’ motion for appointment of counsel on appeal, the\n2   District Court may wish to consider whether to appoint counsel on remand.\n\n                                                   9\n\f",

On September 15, 2003,\n\ninmate Eric Lyons was leaving the prison library. Officer Chirico searched him, and\n\n                                              2\n\f“found 151 pages of legal work belonging to Jacobs.” See Misconduct Report A469502\n\n(against Lyons), attached to complaint. Chirico accused Lyons of lying and saying the\n\nmaterials were his, and told him he was violating prison policy by possessing another\n\ninmate’s legal work when he was not “recognized as a legal aid.” Id. According to\n\nLyons’ affidavit, attached to Jacobs’ complaint, the 151 pages were sent to the Security\n\nOffice. Lyons complained to Lt. Giddens, a shift supervisor, who said he would look into\n\nit. According to Lyons, Giddens later came to his cell and said “he would have been a\n\nfool to return the legal materials to Mr. Jacobs,” because “his name was listed on a\n\nseparate planned civil action and that he anticipated that all the materials will likely be\n\ndestroyed.” Jacobs filed a grievance complaining about the seizure of his documents,\n\nnoting Giddens’ statement that he would have been a fool to return the documents, and\n\ndisputed whether the prison could legally have a policy prohibiting other inmates from\n\nassisting with legal matters. See Grievance No. 63417, attached to the complaint. The\n\ninitial review response (which was performed by Lt. Giddens) stated that only two pages\n\nof Jacobs’ documents had been seized, and stated that his “claim of 151 pages is an\n\noutright fabrication and subject to a misconduct for lying,” even though Chirico himself\n\nhad stated in his report that he had seized 151 pages of documents belonging to Jacobs.\n\nOn appeal, Superintendent Stickman agreed that only two pages had been seized and\n\nstated that they would not be returned because they were considered contraband. The\n\nChief Grievance Officer affirmed on final review, stating that the legal materials were\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fproperly confiscated because they were in the possession of another inmate.\n\n       Jacobs also alleged that on September 16, 2003 (the day after documents were\n\nseized from Lyons), Jacobs’ cell was searched, and additional legal documents were\n\nconfiscated from him; i.e., two declarations that had been executed by inmate Gary\n\nBanks, which Jacobs had planned to attach to his legal filings. Jacobs alleged that Lt.\n\nGiddens threatened Banks with bodily harm if he continued to help Jacobs in his legal\n\nendeavors. (An affidavit by Banks attesting to the same is attached to Jacobs’ complaint).\n\nJacobs was charged with refusing an order, possession of contraband and loaning or\n\nborrowing property. The disciplinary hearing report is largely illegible, but it appears he\n\nwas found guilty of the latter two offenses, and was sanctioned with 30 days of\n\ndisciplinary confinement. The misconduct was affirmed by the Program Review\n\nCommittee and on second level appeal and final review.\n\n       After Jacobs filed his complaint, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant\n\nto Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Magistrate Judge recommended that it be granted, citing\n\nHudson v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), because “the Fourth Amendment right to be free\n\nfrom unreasonable searches and seizures is inconsistent within the prison environment.”\n\nThe Report further recommended dismissing the retaliation claim because “the conduct of\n\nwhich the plaintiff complains was not constitutionally protected,” and even if it was, “he\n\nhas failed to set forth any bases upon which one might conclude that he suffered ‘adverse\n\naction’ as a result of the conduct about which he complains.” The Report also notes that\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fJacobs “knew that prison policy bans inmates from possessing legal materials belonging\n\nto another inmate.” The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation in a one-\n\npage order.\n\n       Accepting as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable\n\ninferences that can be drawn therefrom, as we must, see Nami v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716767\"><a href=\"/opinion/716767/robert-nami-maurice-thompson-bart-fernandez-kenneth-thompson-kenneth-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65\n\n(3d Cir. 1996); we find that Jacobs’ allegations regarding retaliation are sufficient to\n\nsurvive § 12(b)(6) dismissal. To show that prison officials retaliated against a prisoner for\n\nexercising his constitutional rights, the prisoner must plead three elements: 1) the\n\nconduct in which he was engaged was constitutionally protected; 2) he suffered “adverse\n\naction” at the hands of prison officials; and 3) his constitutionally protected conduct was\n\na substantial or motivating factor in the decision to discipline him. Rauser v. Horn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772202\"><a href=\"/opinion/772202/henry-rauser-v-martin-horn-in-his-official-capacity-as-commissioner-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (3d Cir. 2001). Once he has made his prima facie case, the burden shifts\n\nto the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it “would have made\n\nthe same decision absent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to\n\npenological interest.” Carter v. McGrady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777863\"><a href=\"/opinion/777863/richard-carter-sci-mahanoy-para-legal-assistant-on-behalf-of-himself-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158 (3d Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation and citation omitted).\n\n       Here, the District Court stated, without explaining, that “the conduct of which the\n\nplaintiff complains was not constitutionally protected.” Report and Recommendation at\n\n3. The Court may have believed that Jacobs was asserting a right to possess the legal\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f    materials of other inmates.1   We believe Jacobs was asserting a broader right; that of\n\n    access to the courts, which is constitutionally protected. Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n    355 (1996).\n\n           We also believe that Jacobs sufficiently pled the second element; adverse action.\n\n    Jacobs alleged that as a result of the seizure of his legal materials, he lost parties from a\n\n    lawsuit, he was prevented from pursuing certain claims and he was given a disciplinary\n\n    sanction of segregation. Of course, to win a retaliation claim, the plaintiff must show that\n\n    the adverse action was “sufficient to deter a person of ordinary firmness from exercising\n\n    his First Amendment rights.” Allah v. Seiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224-25 (3d Cir. 2000)\n\n    (internal quotation and citation omitted). However, “unless the claimed retaliatory action\n\n    is truly ‘inconsequential,’ the plaintiff’s claim should go to the jury.” Bell v. Johnson,\n\n    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779580\"><a href=\"/opinion/779580/earnest-bell-jr-v-robert-johnson-mark-stimpson-allen-blatter/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 603 (6 th Cir. 2002). We find that Jacobs’ allegations are not\n\n    inconsequential.\n\n           As to the third element, Jacobs presented evidence that the seizure of his\n\n    documents may have been motivated by his prior grievances filed against prison officials,\n\n    and by a desire to prevent him from filing a lawsuit in the future. In particular, Jacobs’\n\n       1\n1        To the extent Jacobs argues that prisoners have a right to assist each other on legal\n2   matters, the Supreme Court has held that prisons may, if consistent with Turner v. Safely,\n3   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987), restrict inmates from assisting other inmates in legal matters. Shaw\n4   v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620698\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620698/shaw-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001). Although the prison policy Jacobs cites as support for\n5   his position (DC-ADM 007) does not expressly prohibit one inmate from aiding another\n6   inmate, it does provide for official “Inmate Legal Reference Aides” and also provides that\n7   such Aides may not assist LTSU inmates (Jacobs was in LTSU at the time of the\n8   incidents complained of ). This is similar to the policy upheld in Shaw.\n\n                                                   6\n\fcomplaint states, inter alia, that “[a]mongst the materials seized from Mr. Lyons was an\n\nanticipated lawsuit in which defendants Giddens, Stickman and Scire were all named as\n\ndefendants,” Complaint at ¶ 38; that Giddens admitted to inmate Banks that he “would be\n\na fool to return the legal materials” because he was named as a defendant in the papers,\n\nComplaint at ¶ 39 and Exhibit A; and that after reading the affidavits that inmate Banks\n\nhad prepared for Jacobs, “Giddens threatened Mr. Banks with bodily harm if he continued\n\nto assist Plaintiff in his legal endeavors against D.O.C. officials,” Complaint at ¶ 50. All\n\nof these allegations, taken as true, tend to show that the prison officials may have had a\n\nretaliatory motive in seizing Jacobs’ documents.\n\n       As noted previously, if a prisoner establishes a prima facie case of retaliation, the\n\nburden then shifts to the defendants to show that they would have taken the same action\n\nabsent the protected conduct for reasons reasonably related to penological interest.\n\nDefendants argue that because the legal documents were “contraband,” the documents\n\nwere taken for a legitimate penological reason. We can understand that in the case of the\n\ndocuments seized from inmate Lyons, the prison might choose to categorize the\n\ndocuments as “contraband” in the hands of Lyons, but it does not necessarily follow that\n\nthe documents should be destroyed, rather than returned to their owner. Indeed, when\n\nJacobs filed a grievance concerning those documents, a staff member responded that he\n\nwould “review the matter with Lt. Giddens, and, if appropriate, the items will be returned\n\nto you.” A jury could infer that only after Giddens determined that the papers included a\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fplanned lawsuit against him did he decide that the papers should be destroyed as\n\n“contraband.” In the case of the documents seized from Jacobs’ cell, it is not clear that\n\nthe prison could legitimately categorize the documents as “contraband,” if they were, as\n\nJacobs alleges, affidavits that inmate Banks prepared for use in Jacobs’ lawsuit. An\n\naffidavit must be prepared by the person having knowledge of the facts asserted therein.\n\nThus, they are in a different category from legal research or legal filings prepared by one\n\nprisoner for another. It is difficult to imagine what the prison’s legitimate penological\n\ninterest would be in seizing and destroying the affidavits, absent any retaliatory motive.\n\nBecause Jacobs’ complaint states a prima facie case for retaliation, that claim should not\n\nhave been dismissed.\n\n       Jacobs also appears to allege that the seizure and destruction of his documents\n\nviolated his First Amendment right of access to the courts. An inmate who alleges a\n\nviolation of the right of access to the courts must show an actual injury. Lewis v. Casey,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 350 (1996). Actual injury can be demonstrated by showing that the\n\ndefendants’ actions resulted in the “loss or rejection of a legal claim.” Oliver v. Fauver,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743496\"><a href=\"/opinion/743496/lorenzo-oliver-v-william-fauver-commissioner-of-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 177 (3d Cir.1997). The underlying lost or rejected legal claim must be\n\nspecifically identified and meritorious. Christopher v. Harbury, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414\n\n(2002). As noted above, Jacobs alleged that because his legal documents were seized, he\n\nlost parties from a lawsuit and was prevented from pursuing certain claims. These\n\nallegations are not sufficiently specific to state a claim. However, when a district court\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f    determines that a complaint is vulnerable to 12(b)(6) dismissal, the court must permit a\n\n    curative amendment, regardless of whether the plaintiff seeks leave to amend, unless an\n\n    amendment would be inequitable or futile. Alston, 363 F.3d at 235-36 (citing Grayson v.\n\n    Mayview State Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777958\"><a href=\"/opinion/777958/norman-grayson-v-mayview-state-hospital-allegheny-county-jail-camp-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108 (3d Cir. 2002)). It appears the District Court\n\n    did not provide Jacobs with this opportunity. See Shane v.

We will allow the District Court to determine in the\n\n    first instance, after giving Jacobs an opportunity to amend his complaint, whether such\n\n    claims survive dismissal.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the order of the District Court and\n\n    remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.2\n\n\n\n\n       2\n1       Although we denied Jacobs’ motion for appointment of counsel on appeal, the\n2   District Court may wish to consider whether to appoint counsel on remand.\n\n                                                   9\n\f</pre>",
