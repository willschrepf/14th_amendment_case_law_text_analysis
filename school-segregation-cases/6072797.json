In the Telecommunications Act of 1996\n(“1996 Act”), Congress amended the 1934 Act to change the\nCommission’s limited regulatory authority over intrastate\n\f                                5\ntelecommunication so as to promote competition in the\npayphone industry.\n\n     Before the passage of the 1996 Act, Bell Operating\nCompanies (“BOCs”) had dominated the payphone industry to\nthe detriment of other providers. Congress sought to remedy\nthis situation by authorizing the Commission to adopt\nregulations ensuring that all payphone providers are “fairly\ncompensated for each and every” interstate and intrastate call.\n47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A). “[P]ayphone service” expressly\nincludes “the provision of inmate telephone service in\ncorrectional institutions, and any ancillary services.” Id.\n§ 276(d). The issues in this case focus on inmate calling\nservices (“ICS”) and the rates and fees charged for these calls.\n\n     Following the passage of the 1996 Act, the Commission\navoided intrusive regulatory measures for ICS. And prior to the\nOrder under review in this case, the Commission had never\nsought to impose rate caps on intrastate calls. Rather, the FCC\nconsistently construed its authority over intrastate payphone\nrates as limited to addressing the problem of under-\ncompensation for ICS providers.\n\n     Due to a variety of market failures in the prison and jail\npayphone industry, however, inmates in correctional facilities,\nor those to whom they placed calls, incurred prohibitive per-\nminute charges and ancillary fees for payphone calls. In the\nface of this problem, the Commission decided to change its\napproach to the regulation of ICS providers. In 2015, in the\nOrder under review, the Commission set permanent rate caps\nand ancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls and, for the first\ntime, imposed those caps on intrastate ICS calls. Rates for\nInterstate Inmate Calling Services (“Order”), 30 FCC Rcd.\n12763, 12775–76, 12838–62 (Nov. 5, 2015), 80 Fed. Reg.\n79136-01 (Dec. 18, 2015). The Commission also proposed to\n\f                               6\nexpand the reach of its ICS regulations by banning or limiting\nfees for billing and collection services – so-called “ancillary\nfees” – and by regulating video services and other advanced\nservices in addition to traditional calling services.\n\n    Five inmate payphone providers, joined by state and local\nauthorities, now challenge the Order’s design to expand the\nFCC’s regulatory authority. In particular, the Petitioners\nchallenge the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates, the\nexclusion of “site commissions” as costs in the agency’s\nratemaking methodology, the use of industry-averaged cost\ndata in the FCC’s calculation of rate caps, the imposition of\nancillary fee caps, and reporting requirements. And one ICS\nprovider separately challenges the Commission’s failure to\npreempt inconsistent state rates and raises a due process\nchallenge.\n\n     Following the presidential inauguration in January 2017,\ncounsel for the FCC advised the court that, due to a change in\nthe composition of the Commission, “a majority of the current\nCommission does not believe that the agency has the authority\nto cap intrastate rates under section 276 of the Act.” Counsel\nthus informed the court that the agency was “abandoning . . .\nthe contention . . . that the Commission has the authority to cap\nintrastate rates” for ICS providers. Counsel also informed the\ncourt that the FCC was abandoning its contention “that the\nCommission lawfully considered industry-wide averages in\nsetting the rate caps.” However, the Commission has not\nrevoked, withdrawn, or suspended the Order. And one of the\nIntervenors on behalf of the Commission, the “Wright\nPetitioners,” continues to press the points that have been\nabandoned by the Commission.\n\n    For the reasons set forth below, we grant in part and deny\nin part the petitions for review, and remand for further\n\f                               7\nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss\ntwo claims as moot.\n\n   We hold that the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates\n    exceed the FCC’s statutory authority under the 1996 Act.\n    We therefore vacate this provision.\n\n   We further hold that the use of industry-averaged cost data\n    as proposed in the Order is arbitrary and capricious because\n    it lacks justification in the record and is not supported by\n    reasoned decisionmaking. We therefore vacate this\n    provision.\n\n   We additionally hold that the Order’s imposition of video\n    visitation reporting requirements is beyond the statutory\n    authority of the Commission. We therefore vacate this\n    provision.\n\n   We find that the Order’s proposed wholesale exclusion of\n    site commission payments from the FCC’s cost calculus is\n    devoid of reasoned decisionmaking and thus arbitrary and\n    capricious. This provision cannot stand as presently\n    proposed in the Order under review; we therefore vacate\n    this provision and remand for further proceedings on the\n    matter.\n\n   We deny the petitions for review of the Order’s site\n    commission reporting requirements.\n\n   We remand the challenge to the Order’s imposition of\n    ancillary fee caps to allow the Commission to determine\n    whether it can segregate proposed caps on interstate calls\n    (which are permissible) and the proposed caps on intrastate\n    calls (which are impermissible).\n\f                               8\n   Finally, we dismiss the preemption and due process claims\n    as moot.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\n    The 1934 Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151, et seq., established a system\nof regulatory authority that divides power between individual\nstates and the FCC over inter- and intrastate telephone\ncommunication services. New England Pub. Commc’ns\nCouncil, Inc. v. FCC, 334 F.3d 69, 75 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Under\nthis statutory scheme, the Commission regulates interstate\ntelephone communication. See id.; 47 U.S.C. § 151. This\nregulatory authority includes ensuring that all charges “in\nconnection with” interstate calls are “just and reasonable.” 47\nU.S.C. § 201(b). “The Commission may prescribe such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to\ncarry out” these provisions. Id.\n\n     The FCC, however, “is generally forbidden from entering\nthe field of intrastate communication service, which remains\nthe province of the states.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75\n(citing 47 U.S.C. § 152(b)). Section 152(b) of the 1934 Act\nerects a presumption against the Commission’s assertion of\nregulatory authority over intrastate communications. This is\n“not only a substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s\npower, but also a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting\nthe Act’s provisions. La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S.\n355, 373 (1986).\n\n    The 1996 Act “fundamentally restructured the local\ntelephone industry,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71, by\nchanging the FCC’s authority with respect to some intrastate\nactivities and “remov[ing] a significant area from the States’\n\f                             9\nexclusive control,” AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 525 U.S.\n366, 382 n.8 (1999). Nevertheless, the states still primarily\n“reign supreme over intrastate rates.” New England Pub., 334\nF.3d at 75 (quoting City of Brookings Mun. Tel. Co. v. FCC,\n822 F.2d 1153, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). “Insofar as Congress\nhas remained silent . . . § 152(b) continues to function. The\nCommission could not, for example, regulate any aspect of\nintrastate communication not governed by the 1996 Act on the\ntheory that it had an ancillary effect on matters within the\nCommission’s primary jurisdiction.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at\n382 n.8.\n\n     Although the strictures of § 152 remain in force, the\nchanges imposed by the 1996 Act were significant. Evidence\nof this is seen in the “Special Provisions Concerning Bell\nOperating Companies.” 47 U.S.C. §§ 271–76. Section 276 was\n“specifically aimed at promoting competition in the payphone\nservice industry.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. While\nlocal phone services were once thought to be natural\nmonopolies, “[t]echnological advances . . . made competition\namong multiple providers of local service seem possible, and\nCongress [in the 1996 Act] ended the longstanding regime of\nstate-sanctioned monopolies.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at 371;\nsee also Glob. Crossing Telecomms., Inc. v. Metrophones\nTelecomms., Inc., 550 U.S. 45, 50 (2007).\n\n    The market history is illuminating. After AT&T had\ndivested its local exchange carriers into individual BOCs in\n1982, BOCs continued to discriminate against non-BOC\npayphone providers and effectively foreclosed competition.\nThe BOCs accomplished this by generally making sure that\nother providers were not compensated for calls using BOC-\nowned payphone lines. See New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71.\nThus, because technology constraints forced many non-BOC\nproviders to use BOC-owned payphone lines, those providers\n\f                              10\nwere often left uncompensated for payphone calls. The 1996\nAct changed these market practices.\n\n     In § 276, Congress clearly aimed to “promote competition\namong payphone service providers and promote the\nwidespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit of\nthe general public.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1). Covered payphone\nservices include “inmate telephone service in correctional\ninstitutions, and any ancillary services.” Id. § 276(d). Section\n276 of the 1996 Act authorizes the Commission “to prescribe\nregulations consistent with the goal of promoting competition,\nrequiring that the Commission take five specific steps toward\nthat goal.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. One such step is\nto “establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all\npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each\nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their\npayphone,” and to prescribe regulations to establish this\ncompensation plan by November 1996. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1),\n(b)(1)(A). The remaining four steps further encourage or force\ncompetition between BOC and non-BOC providers. Id.\n§ 276(b)(1)(B)–(E). Any state requirements that are\ninconsistent with FCC’s regulations adopted pursuant to § 276\nare preempted. Id. § 276(c).\n\nB. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n    Over the years, payphone providers have sought to provide\ninmate calling services to inmates in prisons and jails\nnationwide. ICS providers now compete with one another to\nwin bids for long-term ICS contracts with correctional\nfacilities. In awarding contracts to providers, correctional\nfacilities usually give considerable weight to which provider\noffers the highest site commission, which is typically a portion\nof the provider’s revenue or profits. See Implementation of Pay\nTel. Reclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of\n\f                              11\n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 3248, 3252–53 (2002). Site commissions\napparently range between 20% and 63% of the providers’\nprofits, but can exceed that amount. Id. at 3253 n.34. And ICS\nproviders pay over $460 million in site commissions annually.\nOrder, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12821.\n\n    Once a long-term, exclusive contract bid is awarded to an\nICS provider, competition ceases for the duration of the\ncontract and subsequent contract renewals. Winning ICS\nproviders thus operate locational monopolies with a captive\nconsumer base of inmates and the need to pay high site\ncommissions. See 17 FCC Rcd. at 3253. After a decade of\nindustry consolidation, three specialized ICS firms now control\n85% of the market. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12801. And ICS\nper-minute rates and ancillary fees together are extraordinarily\nhigh, with some rates as high as $56.00 for a four-minute call.\nId. at 12765 n.4.\n\n    In reviewing this market situation, the FCC found that\ninmate calling services are “a prime example of market\nfailure.” Id. at 12765. In its brief to this court, FCC counsel\naptly explains the seriousness of the situation:\n\n   Inmates and their families cannot choose for\n   themselves the inmate calling provider on whose\n   services they rely to communicate. Instead,\n   correctional facilities each have a single provider of\n   inmate calling services. And very often, correctional\n   authorities award that monopoly franchise based\n   principally on what portion of inmate calling revenues\n   a provider will share with the facility—i.e., on the\n   payment of “site commissions.” Accordingly, inmate\n   calling providers compete to offer the highest site\n   commission payments, which they recover through\n   correspondingly higher end-user rates. See [Order, 30\n\f                               12\n   FCC Rcd. at 12818–21]. If inmates and their families\n   wish to speak by telephone, they have no choice but to\n   pay the resulting rates.\n\nBr. for FCC at 4.\n\n    In February 2000, Intervenor Martha Wright filed a\nputative class action against ICS providers on behalf of her\ngrandson, other inmates, and their loved ones to challenge ICS\nrates and fees. Complaint, Wright, et al. v. Corr. Corp. of Am.,\nNo. 1:00-CV-00293 (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 2000). In 2001, the\nDistrict Court stayed the case to afford the FCC the opportunity\nto consider the reasonableness of ICS rates in the first instance\nthrough rulemaking. Thereafter, in 2003 and in 2007, Martha\nWright and others petitioned the Commission for rulemaking\nto regulate ICS rates and fees. Petition for Rulemaking, FCC\nNo. 96-128 (Nov. 3, 2003); Petitioners’ Alternative\nRulemaking Proposal, FCC No. 96-128 (Mar. 1, 2007).\n\n   The record compiled by the Commission fairly clearly\nsupports its determination that ICS charges raise serious\nconcerns. As noted in the FCC’s brief to the court:\n\n      Excessive rates for inmate calling deter\n   communication between inmates and their families,\n   with substantial and damaging social consequences.\n   Inmates’ families may be forced to choose between\n   putting food on the table or paying hundreds of dollars\n   each month to keep in touch. See [Order, 30 FCC Rcd.\n   at 12766–67]. When incarcerated parents lack regular\n   contact with their children, those children—2.7 million\n   of them nationwide—have higher rates of truancy,\n   depression, and poor school performance. See [id. at\n   12766–67 & 12767 n.18]. Barriers to communication\n   from high inmate calling rates interfere with inmates’\n\f                                13\n    ability to consult their attorneys, see [id. at 12765],\n    impede family contact that can “make[] prisons and\n    jails safer spaces,” [id. at 12767], and foster\n    recidivism, see [id. at 12766–67].\n\nBr. for FCC at 4–5. Petitioners do not seriously contest these\nfacts. See Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 7 (acknowledging that “calling\nrates often exceed, sometimes substantially, rates for ordinary\ntoll calls”).\n\n    In 2013, the Commission issued an interim order imposing\na per-minute rate cap for interstate ICS calls, citing its plenary\nauthority over interstate calls under § 201(b) and its mandate\nto ensure that providers are “fairly compensated” under § 276.\nRates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services (“Interim Order”),\n28 FCC Rcd. 14107, 14114–15 (2013). ICS providers\npetitioned for this court’s review of the Interim Order. The\ncourt stayed application of certain portions of the Interim\nOrder but allowed its interstate rate caps to remain in effect.\nOrder, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No. 13-1280 (“Securus I”) (D.C.\nCir. Jan. 13, 2014), ECF No. 1474764 (staying only 47 C.F.R.\n§§ 64.6010, 64.6020, and 64.6060). In December 2014, the\ncourt held the petitions in abeyance while the Commission\nproceeded to set permanent rates. Order, Securus I (D.C. Cir.\nDec. 16, 2014), ECF No. 1527663.\n\n    In 2015, the Commission set permanent rate caps and\nancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls, and for the first time\nthe agency imposed caps on intrastate ICS calls. Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12775–76, 12838–62. The rate caps were set for four\ncategories – “all prisons” and three tiers of jails based on size\n– and the rate caps varied by category. Id. at 12770. The rate\ncaps, which were made effective immediately, ranged from\n$.14 to $.49 per minute, but were to decrease as of July 1, 2018,\nto $.11 to $.22 per minute. Id. In setting the rate caps, the\n\f                              14\nCommission used a ratemaking methodology based on\nindustry-average cost data that excluded site commissions as a\ncost. Id. at 12790, 12818–38. The Order also imposed\nreporting requirements on ICS providers, including for video\nvisitation services and site commissions. Id. at 12890–93.\n\n    ICS providers Global Tel*Link; Securus Technologies,\nInc.; CenturyLink Public Communications, Inc.; Telmate,\nLLC; and Pay Tel Communications (“Pay Tel”) (collectively\n“Petitioners”) separately petitioned for review. Various state\nand local correctional authorities, governments, and\ncorrectional facility organizations petitioned and/or intervened\non behalf of Petitioners. Martha Wright’s putative class and\nvarious inmate-related legal organizations (“Intervenors”)\nintervened on behalf of the Commission.\n\n    In early 2016, the court consolidated the petitions for\nreview. On March 7, 2016, the court stayed the application of\nthe Order’s rate caps and ancillary fee caps as to single-call\nservices while this case was pending. Order, Global Tel*Link,\net al. v.

Order, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 23,\n2016), ECF No. 1605455.\n\n   In August 2016, on reconsideration of the FCC’s Order, the\nCommission raised the rate caps to account for a small portion\nof site commissions. Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling\nServices (“Reconsideration Order”), 31 FCC Rcd. 9300\n(2016). ICS providers petitioned for review of the\nReconsideration Order, but the court held those petitions in\nabeyance and stayed the Reconsideration Order pending the\noutcome of this case. See Order, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No.\n\f                                15\n16-1321 (“Securus II”) (D.C. Cir. Nov. 2, 2016), ECF No.\n1644302.\n\n    On January 31, 2017, counsel for the FCC filed a letter\nadvising this court that the Commission had experienced\n“significant changes in [its] composition.” Letter at 1, Global\nTel*Link (D.C.

Feb. 6, 2017),\nECF No. 1666379.\n\n                        II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. The Posture of this Case\n\n    The current posture of this case is unusual because counsel\nfor the FCC has advised the court that the agency will not\noppose two of the principal challenges raised by Petitioners\nregarding: (1) the authority of the FCC to set permanent rate\ncaps and ancillary fee caps for intrastate ICS calls; and (2) the\nlegality of the Commission’s consideration of industry-wide\naverages in setting rate caps. In light of the FCC’s change of\n\f                                  16\nposition, a question arises as to whether these challenges are\nmoot.\n\n    It is well established that “voluntary cessation of allegedly\nillegal conduct does not deprive [a judicial] tribunal of power\nto hear and determine the case, i.e., does not make the case\nmoot.” United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632\n(1953). As the Court explained:\n\n   A controversy may remain to be settled in such\n   circumstances, e.g., a dispute over the legality of the\n   challenged practices. The defendant is free to return to\n   his old ways. This, together with a public interest in\n   having the legality of the practices settled, militates\n   against a mootness conclusion. For to say that the case\n   has become moot means that the defendant is entitled\n   to a dismissal as a matter of right. The courts have\n   rightly refused to grant defendants such a powerful\n   weapon against public law enforcement.\n\nId. at 632 (citations omitted).\n\n    “Voluntary cessation” justifies the dismissal of a case on\ngrounds of mootness only when “the defendant can\ndemonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the\nwrong will be repeated. The burden is a heavy one.” Id. at 633\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,\n528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000) (“[T]he standard we have announced\nfor determining whether a case has been mooted by the\ndefendant’s voluntary conduct is stringent: ‘A case might\nbecome moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that\nthe allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be\nexpected to recur.’ The ‘heavy burden of persua[ding]’ the\ncourt that the challenged conduct cannot reasonably be\n\f                                17\nexpected to start up again lies with the party asserting\nmootness.” (quoting United States v. Concentrated Phosphate\nExport Ass’n, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968))); Payne Enters., Inc.\nv. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 491–92 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(same).\n\n    There is absolutely no basis for dismissing as moot the\nclaims relating to the issues that the FCC has “abandoned.”\nIndeed, neither the FCC, the Petitioners, nor the Intervenors\nhave urged this. The reason is fairly simple: the Order that gave\nrise to the petitions for review is still in force. Although counsel\nfor the FCC has made it clear that the agency will not defend\nportions of the Order, the Commission has never acted to\nrevoke, withdraw, or suspend the Order. Given this posture of\nthe case, it is plain that there has been no “voluntary cessation”\nby the FCC that would warrant dismissal of Petitioners’\nchallenges to the Order.\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n   Although Petitioners’ challenges to the provisions of the\nOrder purporting to cap intrastate rates and to apply industry-\nwide averages in setting rate caps are not moot, a question\nremains as to what standard governs our review of these\nprovisions. Normally, we would follow the familiar two-step\nChevron framework as the appropriate standard of review. See\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n837 (1984). Under the Chevron framework,\n\n    an agency’s power to regulate “is limited to the scope\n    of the authority Congress has delegated to it.” Am.\n    Library Ass’n v. FCC, 406 F.3d 689, 698 (D.C. Cir.\n    2005). Pursuant to Chevron Step One, if the intent of\n    Congress is clear, the reviewing court must give effect\n    to that unambiguously expressed intent. If Congress\n\f                              18\n   has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,\n   the reviewing court proceeds to Chevron Step Two.\n   Under Step Two, “[i]f Congress has explicitly left a\n   gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation\n   of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific\n   provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative\n   regulations are given controlling weight unless they are\n   . . . manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron, 467\n   U.S. at 843–44. Where a “legislative delegation to an\n   agency on a particular question is implicit rather than\n   explicit,” the reviewing court must uphold any\n   “reasonable interpretation made by the administrator\n   of [that] agency.” Id. at 844. But deference to an\n   agency’s interpretation of its enabling statute “is due\n   only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated\n   authority.” Am. Library Ass’n, 406 F.3d at 699.\n\nEDWARDS, ELLIOTT, AND LEVY, FEDERAL STANDARDS                   OF\nREVIEW 166–67 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n    The disputed Order in this case was promulgated by the\nFCC “carrying the force of law.” United States v. Mead Corp.,\n533 U.S. 218, 226–27 (2001). Therefore, it was presumptively\nsubject to review pursuant to Chevron. Id. The oddity here,\nhowever, is that the agency no longer seeks deference for the\nparts of the Order purporting to cap intrastate rates for ICS\nproviders and to apply industry-wide averages in setting the\nrate caps. In these circumstances, it would make no sense for\nthis court to determine whether the disputed agency positions\nadvanced in the Order warrant Chevron deference when the\nagency has abandoned those positions.\n\n    Although the Chevron framework is of no significance with\nrespect to the cap on intrastate rates and the application of\nindustry-wide averages issues, this does not affect the court’s\n\f                                 19\njurisdiction to address these issues. See, e.g., New Process\nSteel, L.P. v. NLRB, 560 U.S. 674, 679–83 (2010) (deciding the\nstatutory issue without reference to the Chevron framework).\nTherefore, “[w]ith Chevron inapplicable, . . . ‘we must decide\nfor ourselves the best reading’” of the statutory provisions at\nissue in this case. Miller v. Clinton, 687 F.3d 1332, 1342 (D.C.\nCir. 2012) (quoting Landmark Legal Found. v. IRS, 267 F.3d\n1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).\n\n    It is well recognized that when a disputed agency\ninterpretation does not carry the force of law, it still may be\n“entitled to respect,” at least to the extent that the interpretation\nhas the “power to persuade.” Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S.\n134, 140 (1944); see also Mead, 533 U.S. at 227–31;\nChristensen v. Harris Cty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000).\nHowever, in this case, because the FCC now offers no\ninterpretations in support the provisions of the Order\npurporting to cap intrastate rates for ICS providers and apply\nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps, the court must\nresolve these issues applying the usual rules of statutory\nconstruction. See, e.g., MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. &\nTel. Co., 512 U.S. 218 (1994); see generally ROBERT A.\nKATZMANN, JUDGING STATUTES (2014); WILLIAM N.\nESKRIDGE, JR., ABBE R. GLUCK & VICTORIA F. NOURSE,\nSTATUTES, REGULATION, AND INTERPRETATION 409–29\n(2014).\n\n     With respect to the remaining issues before the court, we\nwill apply the Chevron framework, as applicable. As to all\nother issues, we will apply § 706(2)(A) of the Administrative\nProcedure Act (“APA”), which provides that a reviewing court\nshall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and\nconclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 706(2)(A). Under this standard of review, we search for\n\f                                20\n“reasoned decisionmaking.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S.,\nInc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (“State Farm”), 463 U.S.\n29, 52 (1983). This means that we must determine whether the\nFCC “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a\nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id.\nat 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nC. The Authority of the FCC to Set Permanent Rate Caps\n   and Ancillary Fee Caps for Intrastate ICS Calls\n\n    In the disputed Order, the Commission asserted authority\nto impose rate caps on intrastate ICS calls for the first time. It\ndid so under the guise of § 276 of the 1996 Act, which requires\nthe Commission to “establish a per call compensation plan to\nensure that all payphone service providers are fairly\ncompensated for each and every completed intrastate and\ninterstate call using their payphone,” and to prescribe\nregulations to establish this compensation plan. 47 U.S.C.\n§ 276(b)(1), (b)(1)(A). Petitioners assert that the provision in\n§ 276, requiring the Commission to ensure that ICS providers\nare “fairly compensated,” does not override the command of\n§ 152(b), which forbids the FCC from asserting jurisdiction\nover “charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or\nregulations for or in connection with intrastate communication\nservice.” 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (emphasis added). Petitioners also\ncontend that § 276 does not give the Commission ratemaking\nauthority comparable to the authority that it has under § 201 to\nregulate and cap interstate rates. Finally, Petitioners point out\nthat the intrastate rate caps prescribed in the Order make little\nsense in light of the undisputed record evidence showing that\nmany ICS providers have costs that are higher than the disputed\nrate caps. We agree with Petitioners that, on the record in this\ncase, § 276 did not authorize the Commission to impose\n\f                               21\nintrastate rate caps as prescribed in the Order. Several\nconsiderations have influenced our judgment on this matter.\n\n    First, as noted above, § 152(b) of the 1934 Act erects a\npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory\nauthority over intrastate communications. La. Pub. Serv.\nComm’n, 476 U.S. at 373 (making it clear that this is “not only\na substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s power, but\nalso a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting the Act’s\nprovisions). As we explain below, the Order in this case does\nnot come close to overcoming this presumption in proposing to\ncap intrastate rates.\n\n    Second, the Order erroneously treats the Commission’s\nauthority under § 201 and § 276 as coterminous. Section 201\nimbues the Commission with traditional ratemaking powers\nover interstate calls, including the imposition of rate caps. The\nstatute explicitly directs the FCC to ensure that interstate rates\nare “just and reasonable,” and to “prescribe such rules and\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest” to carry\nout these provisions. 47 U.S.C. § 201(b). Section 276, however,\ndoes not give the Commission authority to determine “just and\nreasonable” rates. Rather, § 276 merely directs the Commission\nto “ensure that all [ICS] providers are fairly compensated” for\ntheir inter- and intrastate calls. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A).\n\n    The language and purpose of § 201 in the 1934 Act are\nfundamentally different from the language and purpose of\n§ 276 in the 1996 Act. The Order glosses over these differences\nin declaring that the Commission has authority to ensure that\nrates are “just, reasonable and fair.” See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12766, 12817. This is not what § 201(b) and § 276 say.\nAnd once the Order misquotes the language of § 201(b) and\n§ 276, it goes on to conclude that these provisions in their\ncombined effect authorize the FCC to set rate caps to ensure\n\f                                22\nthat both inter- and intrastate rates are “‘just and reasonable’\nand do not take unfair advantage of inmates, their families, or\nproviders consistent with the ‘fair compensation’ mandate of\nsection 276.” Id. at 12817. In other words, in ignoring the terms\nof § 276, the Order conflates two distinct statutory grants of\nauthority into a synthetic “just, reasonable and fair” standard.\nThis is impermissible.\n\n    Third, the Order asserts that the Commission “has\npreviously found that the term ‘fairly compensated’ [in § 276]\npermits a range of compensation rates . . ., but that the interests\nof both the payphone service providers and the parties paying\nthe compensation must be taken into account,” implying\nconsiderations of fairness to the consumer. Id. at 12814 n.335.\nThis assertion is unfounded. The truth is that the Commission’s\nprior orders align with a narrow reading of the statute that does\nnot purport to treat the Commission’s authority under § 201\nand § 276 as coterminous. The FCC’s prior orders to which the\nOrder here refers construed the “fairly compensated” mandate\nof § 276 as irrelevant to ICS rates reached through contractual\nbargaining. This was because the FCC had determined that\n“whenever a [payphone provider] is able to negotiate for itself\nthe terms of compensation for the calls its payphones originate,\nthen [the Commission’s] statutory obligation to provide fair\ncompensation is satisfied.” Implementation of the Pay Tel.\nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of\n1996, 11 FCC Rcd. 21233, 21269 (1996). This is hardly\nevidence of “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking under § 276.\n\n   Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Commission’s prior\norders repeatedly acknowledge that § 276 focuses on the\nproblem of uncompensated calls in situations in which BOC\nproviders engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In other\nwords, the FCC recognized that a principal reason for the\nenactment of § 276 was to address “the limitation on the ability\n\f                               23\nof [payphone providers] and carriers to negotiate a mutually\nagreeable amount” because of technological and regulatory\nconstraints. Implementation of the Pay Tel. Reclassification &\nComp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 14 FCC Rcd.\n2545, 2551, 2569 (1999). Therefore, the prior orders to which\nthe Order at issue here refers focused on payphone providers\nand carriers to determine whether the providers were fairly\ncompensated. See, e.g., id. at 2570; Implementation of Pay Tel.\nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of\n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 21274, 21302 (2002) (referring to providers\nand the carriers compensating the providers in stating that\n§ 276 “implies fairness to both sides”). The prior orders did not\nreflect anything approaching “just, reasonable and fair”\nratemaking for intrastate rates as authorized by § 201 for\ninterstate rates.\n\n    In the agency brief that was filed with the court before the\nFCC abandoned its support of the intrastate rate caps, counsel\nargued that fairness to the consumer is implied in § 276 because\nthe reference to “fair” (in “fairly compensated”) is “capacious.”\nBr. for FCC at 31. This argument finds no support in the Order.\nAs noted above, the Order simply asserts that intrastate rate\ncaps are consistent with the Commission’s past orders. And, as\nnoted above, the Commission’s past orders do not support a\n“capacious” interpretation of “fairly compensated” in § 276 to\nsuggest that it is comparable to “just, reasonable and fair”\nratemaking in § 201. The prior orders merely relied on the\n“fairly compensated” language to set a default rate from which\nthe payphone providers and carriers could negotiate a\ndeparture, not to reduce bargained-for compensation. See, e.g.,\n11 FCC Rcd. at 21267–69; 14 FCC Rcd. at 2569–71. The\nCommission made it clear that it meant to “g[i]ve primary\nimportance to Congress’s objective of establishing a market-\nbased, deregulatory mechanism for payphone compensation, as\n\f                                24\nrequired both in section 276 and the generally pro-competitive\ngoals of the 1996 Act.” 14 FCC Rcd. at 2548.\n\n    Finally, the Order cites two decisions of this court to justify\nan interpretation of the “fair compensation” mandate in § 276\nthat includes “just and reasonable” ratemaking in § 201. Order,\n30 FCC Rcd. at 12815–16 (citing Ill. Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v.\nFCC, 117 F.3d 555, 562 (D.C. Cir. 1997); New England Pub.,\n334 F.3d at 75). The Order’s construction of these decisions is\nmisguided because neither decision compels the conclusion\nthat § 276 authorizes the Commission to cap intrastate rates\npursuant to “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking.\n\n     The Order first extracts language from the decision in\nIllinois saying that § 276 provides the Commission with\n“authority to set local coin call rates.” 117 F.3d at 562. But in\nthe order under review in Illinois, the FCC did not “set” local\ncoin call rates by imposing caps on intrastate rates. Rather, the\nagency merely interpreted the mandate of § 276(b)(1)(A) to\n“require[] the Commission to act only with respect to those\ntypes of calls for which a [payphone provider] does not already\nreceive fair compensation.” Id. at 559 (emphasis added). And\neven for those calls, the FCC ultimately determined a default\nfloor based on the deregulated market rate and allowed the\npayphone providers to negotiate a departure from that rate. Id.\nat 560.\n\n    In reviewing the FCC’s order that was contested in Illinois,\nwe held that § 276 unambiguously overrode § 152(b)’s\npresumption against intrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted\nthe Commission authority to “set” reimbursement rates for\nlocal coin calls in order to ensure that payphone operators who\nwere previously uncompensated were “fairly compensated.”\nId. at 561–63. The court did not say that § 276 overrode the\npresumption against intrastate jurisdiction to allow the\n\f                                25\nCommission to reduce already compensatory rates, which is\nwhat the Order at issue in this case suggests. Rather, the Illinois\ncourt said:\n\n    If locational monopolies turn out to be a problem,\n    however, the Commission suggested some ways in\n    which it might deal with them: a State might be\n    permitted to require competitive bidding for locational\n    contracts, or to mandate that additional [payphone\n    providers] be allowed to provide payphones at the\n    location; and if these remedies fail, the Commission\n    may consider the matter further.\n\nId. at 562–63. None of these options contemplated caps on\nintrastate rates.\n\n     It is true that the decision in Illinois does not explicitly\npreclude the Commission from imposing intrastate rate caps.\nThat was not the question before the court. But the Order at\nissue in this case is wrong in suggesting that the decision in\nIllinois reflects “significant judicial precedent [that] supports\nthe Commission’s authority” to reduce already compensatory\nrates. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12815. Indeed, in Illinois the court\nreversed the Commission’s decision to exclude certain\nuncompensated calls from its mandatory compensation plan\nbecause the failure to provide compensation for this type of\npayphone call was “patently inconsistent with § 276’s\ncommand that fair compensation be provided for ‘each and\nevery completed . . . call.’” 117 F.3d at 566.\n\n    The Order at issue in this case also purports to rely on a\nstatement in the New England decision that § 276\n“unambiguously and straightforwardly authorizes the\nCommission to regulate . . . intrastate payphone line rates.”\nOrder at 12815 (quoting New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75).\n\f                                26\nBut here again the cited decision merely confirmed that the\n1996 Act expanded the Commission’s intrastate regulatory\nauthority within the limited parameters of § 276. The New\nEngland court held that Congress had authorized the\nCommission to carry out the anti-subsidy and anti-\ndiscrimination mandates of § 276(b)(1)(D)–(E) as to both inter-\nand intrastate payphone providers because Congress intended\n§ 276 as a whole to “authorize the Commission to eliminate\nbarriers to competition.” 334 F.3d at 77. But when pressed to\nextend § 276’s anti-subsidy and anti-discrimination mandates\nto non-BOC carriers, the court said, “the fact remains that\nsections 276(a) and 276(b)(1)(C), the sources of the\nCommission’s authority to regulate intrastate payphone rates,\nexpressly apply only to the BOCs.” Id. at 78. The court was\nalso clear in saying that outside the specific directives of § 276,\ngeneral provisions “cannot . . . trump section 152(b)’s specific\ncommand that no Commission regulations shall preempt state\nregulations unless Congress expressly so indicates. Absent\nauthorization to apply its section 276 regulations to non-BOC\n[carriers], the Commission may not regulate their intrastate\npayphone line rates.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n    Thus, neither Illinois nor New England stands for the\nproposition that the Commission has broad plenary authority to\nregulate and cap intrastate rates. Rather these decisions confirm\nthe limited scope of § 276 which must be applied within the\nexpress bounds of its specific directives.\n\n    The Order’s misconstruction of our case law stems from its\nfundamental misreading of § 276. The Order acknowledges\nthat the Commission’s authority over intrastate calls is, “except\nas otherwise provided by Congress, generally limited by\nsection [152(b)] of the Act.” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12814. The\nCommission thus recognized that to assert jurisdiction over\nintrastate rates, the 1996 Act must “unambiguously appl[y] to\n\f                                27\nintrastate services.” Id. The Order errs, however, in concluding\nthat § 276 required it “to broadly craft regulations to ‘promote\nthe widespread development of payphone services for the\nbenefit of the general public,’” and that this constituted a\n“general grant of jurisdiction.” Id. (quoting 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1)). This misreads the language of § 276. The statute\nmerely commands the Commission, “[i]n order to promote\ncompetition among payphone service providers and promote\nthe widespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit\nof the general public,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1), to prescribe\nregulations to accomplish “five specific steps toward that\ngoal,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. This is not a “general\ngrant of jurisdiction” over intrastate ratemaking.\n\n    The Order at issue in this case is legally infirm because it\npurports to cap intrastate rates based on a “just, reasonable and\nfair” test that is not enunciated in the statute, conflates distinct\ngrants of authority under § 201 and § 276, and misreads our\njudicial precedent and the FCC’s own prior orders to support\ncapping already compensatory rates under the guise of ensuring\nproviders are “fairly compensated.” The point here is\nstraightforward:\n\n       The FCC’s belief that lower ICS calling rates reflect\n    desirable social policy cannot justify regulations that\n    exceed its statutory mandate. Section 276 of the\n    Communications Act authorizes the FCC to ensure that\n    ICS providers are not deprived of fair compensation\n    for the use of their payphones; § 201 authorizes it to\n    ensure that rates for and in connection with interstate\n    telecommunications services are just and reasonable.\n    The FCC may not ignore these statutory limits to\n    advance its preferred correctional policy.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 4.\n\f                               28\n    We therefore reverse and vacate the provision in the Order\nthat purports to cap intrastate rates as beyond the statutory\nauthority of the Commission. We need not decide the precise\nparameters of the Commission’s authority under § 276. We\nsimply hold here that the agency’s attempted exercise of\nauthority in the disputed Order cannot stand.\n\nD. The Categorical Exclusion of Site Commission Costs\n\n   The Petitioners contend that:\n\n      The FCC’s exclusion of site commission payments\n   from the costs used to set ICS rate caps was unlawful.\n   ICS providers are required by state and local\n   governments and correctional institutions to pay site\n   commissions; those commissions are accordingly a\n   cost of providing service like other state taxes and fees\n   that the FCC recognizes as recoverable costs. The FCC\n   acknowledged that, taking site commissions into\n   consideration, the rate caps were below providers’\n   costs. This violates the FCC’s obligation to “ensure\n   that all payphone service providers are fairly\n   compensated,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A), § 201’s “just\n   and reasonable” requirement, and the Constitution’s\n   Takings Clause.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16. The concerns raised by Petitioners\nare compelling.\n\n    The Commission’s categorical exclusion of site\ncommissions from the calculus used to set ICS rate caps defies\nreasoned decisionmaking because site commissions obviously\nare costs of doing business incurred by ICS providers. Yet, the\nOrder categorically excluded site commissions and then “set\nthe rate caps below cost.” Id. at 20. This is hard to fathom. “An\n\f                               29\nagency acts arbitrarily or capriciously if it has . . . offered an\nexplanation either contrary to the evidence before the agency\nor so implausible as not to reflect either a difference in view or\nagency expertise.” Defs. of Wildlife & Ctr. for Biological\nDiversity v. Jewell, 815 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43). Ignoring costs that the Commission\nacknowledges to be legitimate is implausible.\n\n    The FCC’s suggestion that site commissions “have nothing\nto do with the provision of ICS,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12822\n(internal quotation marks omitted), makes no sense in light of\nthe undisputed record in this case. In some instances,\ncommissions are mandated by state statute, Rates for Interstate\nInmate Calling Services, 27 FCC Rcd. 16629, 16643 (2012),\nand in other instances commissions are required by state\ncorrectional institutions as a condition of doing business with\nICS providers, 17 FCC Rcd. at 3252–53. “If agreeing to pay\nsite commissions is a condition precedent to ICS providers\noffering their services, those commissions are ‘related to the\nprovision of ICS.’” Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 21. And it does not\nmatter that the states may use the commissions for purposes\nunrelated to the activities of correctional facilities. The ICS\nproviders who are required to pay the site commissions as a\ncondition of doing business have no control over the funds once\nthey are paid. None of the other reasons offered by the\nCommission to justify the categorical exclusion of site\ncommissions passes muster.\n\n    On the record before us, we simply cannot comprehend the\nagency’s reasoning. Where, as here, an agency’s “explanation\nfor its determination . . . lacks any coherence,” we owe “no\ndeference to [the agency’s] purported expertise.” Tripoli\nRocketry Ass’n v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and\nExplosives, 437 F.3d 75, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see also Coburn\nv. McHugh, 679 F.3d 924 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Not only does the\n\f                              30\nFCC’s reasoning defy comprehension, the categorical\nexclusion of site commissions cannot be easily squared with\nthe requirements of § 276 and § 201. We therefore vacate this\nportion of the Order.\n\n    In its 2016 Reconsideration Order, the Commission raised\nthe rate caps specifically to account for a portion of site\ncommissions, effectively acknowledging that a categorical\nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus is\nimplausible. The Commission said:\n\n   [W]e have decided, out of an abundance of caution, to\n   take a more conservative approach and expressly\n   account for facilities’ ICS-related costs when\n   calculating our rate caps. Accordingly, we grant the\n   Hamden Petition in part . . . and increase our interstate\n   and intrastate rate caps to expressly account for\n   reasonable facility costs related to ICS.\n\nReconsideration Order, 31 FCC Rcd. at 9302. Although the\nFCC purported to change its position in the Reconsideration\nOrder, that order does not moot Petitioner’s challenge here.\nSee, e.g., N.E. Fla. Contractors v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 663,\n662 (1993) (replacing the challenged law “with one that differs\nonly in some insignificant respect” and “disadvantages\n[petitioners] in the same fundamental way” does not moot the\nunderlying challenge).\n\n     The Reconsideration Order is not before us, so we cannot\nsay whether it provides a satisfactory response to Petitioners’\nchallenge. We will leave this for the Commission’s\nconsideration on remand. We also leave it to the Commission\nto assess on remand which portions of site commissions might\nbe directly related to the provision of ICS and therefore\nlegitimate, and which are not. In addition, although we\n\f                               31\nconclude that the Order at issue here is arbitrary and capricious\ninsofar as it categorically excludes site commissions from the\nratemaking calculus, we do not reach Petitioners’ remaining\narguments that the exclusion of site commissions denies ICS\nproviders fair compensation under § 276 and violates the\nTakings Clause of the Constitution because it forces providers\nto provide services below cost. These matters should be\naddressed by the Commission on remand once it revisits the\nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus.\n\nE. The Legality of the FCC’s Use of Industry-Wide\n   Averages in Setting Rate Caps\n\n   Petitioners contend that:\n\n      Even if site commissions are disregarded, the rate\n   caps were set too low to ensure compensation “for each\n   and every completed . . . call.” [47 U.S.C. §\n   276(b)(1)(A)]. The FCC’s caps are below average\n   costs documented by numerous ICS providers and\n   would deny cost recovery for a substantial percentage\n   of all inmate calls. The FCC’s assertion that ICS\n   providers with costs above the caps operate\n   inefficiently is contrary to the record. The FCC relied\n   on two outlier ICS providers that — combined —\n   represent 0.1 percent of the ICS market. And it ignored\n   evidence showing that the cost to provide ICS varies\n   widely on the basis of regional differences, such as the\n   age and condition of a given facility or the specific\n   security features that correctional authorities demand.\n\n   ****\n\n   The record includes two economic analyses, both\n   concluding that the Order’s rate caps are below cost\n\f                                32\n    for a substantial number of ICS calls even after\n    excluding site commissions. . . .\n\n    The Order does not challenge these studies or their\n    conclusions. On the contrary, it acknowledges that\n    seven of 14 ICS providers that submitted cost data\n    reported per-minute costs of “$0.25 or higher,” above\n    the highest prepaid rate cap of $0.22 per minute.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16–17, 30–31 (quoting Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12669–70, 12795). Petitioners’ claims are well taken\nand largely undisputed. And, as noted above, the FCC has\nabandoned its contention that the agency lawfully considered\nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps, and for good\nreasons.\n\n     First, to the extent that the Order purports to set caps for\nintrastate rates, it is infirm for the reasons stated above. Second,\nthe averaging calculus is patently unreasonable. The FCC\ncalculated its rate caps “using a weighted average per minute\ncost,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790, allowing providers to\n“recover average costs at each and every tier,” id. n.170. This\nmakes calls with above-average costs in each tier unprofitable,\nhowever, and thus does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that\n“each and every” inter- and intrastate call be fairly\ncompensated. See Am. Pub. Commc’ns Council v. FCC, 215\nF.3d 51, 54, 57–58 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n     Moreover, the Order advances an efficiency argument –\nthat the larger providers can become profitable under the rate\ncaps if they operate more efficiently – based on data from the\ntwo smallest firms. See Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790–95. Not\nonly do those firms represent less than one percent of the\nindustry, but the record shows that regional variation, not\nefficiency, accounts for cost discrepancies among providers.\n\f                               33\nSee id. at 12965 n.61 (dissenting statement of Commissioner\nPai). The Order does not account for these conflicting record\ndata.\n\n     In sum, the Order’s analysis of the record data in setting\nrate caps was not the product of reasoned decisionmaking. We\nwill therefore vacate that portion of the Order and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nF.   The Imposition of Ancillary Fee Caps\n\n     Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, the Order’s\nimposition of ancillary fee caps in connection with interstate\ncalls is justified. The Commission has plenary authority to\nregulate interstate rates under § 201(b), including “practices\n. . . for and in connection with” interstate calls. The Order\nexplains that ICS providers use ancillary fees as a loophole in\navoiding per-minute rate caps. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12842.\nFurthermore, ancillary fees for interstate calls satisfy the test\nof the Commission’s authority under § 201(b) as they are “in\nconnection with” interstate calls. However, these\nconsiderations do not fully answer the question whether the\ndisputed imposition of ancillary fee caps is permissible.\n\n    As noted above, we have found that, on the record in this\ncase, the Order’s imposition of intrastate rate caps fails review\nunder § 276. Therefore, we likewise hold that the FCC had no\nauthority to impose ancillary fee caps with respect to intrastate\ncalls. However, we cannot discern from the record whether\nancillary fees can be segregated between interstate and\nintrastate calls. We are therefore obliged to remand the matter\nto the FCC for further consideration.\n\f                               34\nG. The Imposition of Reporting Requirements\n\n     The Commission initially contended that the Order’s\nrequirements with respect to reporting requirements for video\nvisitation services and site commissions were unripe for review\nbecause they were pending budgetary approval by the Office\nof Management and Budget (“OMB”). After briefing, however,\nOMB approval was published. See 82 Fed. Reg. 12182-01\n(Mar. 1, 2017). Accordingly, the Commission withdrew its\nripeness challenge. Letter, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 1,\n2017), ECF No. 1663705. Therefore, the parties agree that we\nmay review the Commission’s imposition of the disputed\nreporting requirements.\n\n     We hold that the video visitation services reporting\nrequirement, 47 C.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(4), is too attenuated to the\nCommission’s statutory authority to justify this requirement.\nThe Commission asserts that whether or not video visitation\nservices are a form of ICS, they are still subject to the agency’s\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12891–92; Br. for\nFCC at 56–57. We disagree. Before it may assert its jurisdiction\nto impose such a reporting requirement, the Commission must\nfirst explain how its statutory authority extends to video\nvisitation services as a “communication[] by wire or radio”\nunder § 201(b) for interstate calls or as an “inmate telephone\nservice” under § 276(d) for interstate or intrastate calls. The\nOrder under review offers no such explanations. We therefore\nvacate the reporting requirement for video visitation services.\n\n     In contrast, we find no merit in Petitioners’ challenge to\nthe site commission payment reporting requirement under 47\nC.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(3). The quibble between the parties is\nlargely over semantics. The Commission agrees that the\ndefinition of site commission payment should be read largely\nas Petitioners argue: namely, site commissions are “incentive\n\f                               35\npayments designed to influence a correctional authority’s\nselection of its monopoly service provider, not a form of\nordinary tax.” Br. for FCC at 59 (citing Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at\n12818–22). So defined, the reporting requirement is lawful on\nits face and Petitioners do not disagree. We therefore deny the\npetition for review.\n\nH. The Preemption and Due Process Claims\n\n     Petitioner Pay Tel separately challenges the Commission’s\nrefusal to preempt certain state ICS rate caps that are lower than\nthose the Commission set in the Order. Because we are\nvacating the portion of the Order imposing intrastate rate caps\nunder § 276(b), the preemption provision under § 276(c) is no\nlonger at issue. There are no relevant regulations under § 276\nremaining in the Order with respect to which the lower state\nrate caps might be preempted. This issue is therefore moot.\n\n     Pay Tel’s claim that its due process rights were infringed\nwhen it was not given timely access to key cost data that the\nFCC relied on in setting the rate caps is also moot. We are\nvacating the portion of the Order setting rate caps for intrastate\nrates; the Commission has acknowledged that its use of\nindustry-average data to set rates was error; and Pay Tel\nobtained access to the disputed data prior to the Commission’s\nissuance of the Reconsideration Order setting rate caps that\nsupersede those in the Order at issue. The concerns raised by\nPay Tel are thus moot.\n\n                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n    In accordance with the foregoing opinion, we grant in part\nand deny in part the petitions for review, vacate certain\nprovisions in the disputed Order, and remand for further\n\f                            36\nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss\ntwo claims as moot.\n\n                                               So ordered.\n\f      SILBERMAN, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: I concur\nwith Judge Edwards’ opinion in all respects. I especially agree\nthat Chevron deference would be inappropriate in these unusual\ncircumstances. I write separately to point out, as to the FCC’s\nclaimed jurisdiction to set intrastate rate caps, that I think our\nresult would be the same if the Chevron framework was in play,\ni.e., if the FCC had elected to defend this part of its regulation.\n\n     There is no question that the relevant statutory language,\n“fairly compensated,” is ambiguous. 47 U.S.C. 276(b)(1)(A).\nEven the FCC agrees. But Judge Edwards’ careful explanation\nof the statute’s structure and context demonstrates that the\nagency’s interpretation would fail at Chevron’s second step; it\nis an unreasonable (impermissible) interpretation of section 276.\n\n     Much of the recent expressed concern about Chevron\nignores that Chevron’s second step can and should be a\nmeaningful limitation on the ability of administrative agencies\nto exploit statutory ambiguities, assert farfetched interpretations,\nand usurp undelegated policymaking discretion.1 This case\npresents just one example of those kinds of agency tactics.\nThere are others. Accord Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135 S.\nCt. 2699, 2713 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (“Although we\nhold today that [the agency] exceeded even the extremely\npermissive limits on agency power set by our precedents, we\n\n\n\n     1\n       See, e.g., City of Arlington v. FCC, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 1863\n(2013) (Roberts, C.J., dissenting). Of course, some also question “step\ntwo” itself. For example, an essay in the Virginia Law Review\ncontended that “Chevron Has Only One Step.” Matthew C.\nStephenson & Adrian Vermeule, 95 Va. L. Rev. 597 (2009). But that\nposition ignores the practical effect on future agency discretion of a\ncourt opinion either affirming or reversing an agency interpretation at\nstep one versus step two. Cf. Nat’l Cable & Telecomms. Ass’n v.\nBrand X Internet Servs., 545 U.S. 967 (2005).\n\f                                2\n\nshould be alarmed that it felt sufficiently emboldened by those\nprecedents to make the bid for deference that it did here.”)\n\n     To be sure, some have lamented that as a practical matter,\nunder Chevron, either the case is decided at the first step or the\nagency prevails once it receives deference under step two. But\nthat is not what the Chevron case called for.\n\n     Chevron itself involved a phrase “stationary source” that\nwas not at all defined and clearly could equally refer to (a) a\nfactory complex, or (b) a specific emitter of pollution. 467 U.S.\n837, 860-64 (1984). But it would have been unreasonable to\nrefer to (c) a whole city. Yet too many times agencies have\ntaken advantage of an ambiguity to pursue a (c), (d), or (f)\ninterpretation that accorded with policy objectives. See, e.g.,\nVerizon v. FCC, 740 F.3d 623, 660 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (Silberman,\nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n     Unfortunately, the Supreme Court for some time after\nChevron contributed to the step one winner-take-all narrative by\nneglecting to rely on step two even when it was really called for.\nTake for example MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. AT&T Co.,\n512 U.S. 218 (1994), in which Justice Scalia—perhaps the\nforemost expositor of Chevron—used statutory structure and\ncontext, much like Judge Edwards does in our case, to\ndemonstrate that the FCC’s reliance on the word “modify” was\nunacceptable, see, e.g., id. at 228-29. But he never conceded\nthat the word “modify” was ambiguous, which it was. Id. at 228\n(“We have not the slightest doubt that [single definition] is the\nmeaning the statute intended.”).\n\n     Subsequently, however, in AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities\nBoard, 525 U.S. 366 (1999), Justice Scalia implicitly relied on\nstep two. He concluded that because the agency failed to\ninterpret the terms of the statute “in a reasonable fashion,” the\n\f                               3\n\nrule must be vacated. Id. at 392. Then, in City of Arlington v.\nFCC, — U.S. —, 133 S. Ct. 1863 (2013), he admonished that\n“where Congress has established an ambiguous line, the agency\ncan go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow,” id. at\n1874. And most recently in Michigan v. EPA, — U.S. —, 135\nS. Ct. 2699 (2015), when invalidating agency action under step\ntwo, he was more explicit still: “Chevron allows agencies to\nchoose among competing reasonable interpretations of a statute;\nit does not license interpretive gerrymanders under which an\nagency keeps parts of statutory context it likes while throwing\naway parts it does not,” id. at 2708.\n\n    We have at times been careful to apply step two review\nvigorously. See, e.g., Goldstein v. SEC, 451 F.3d 873 (D.C. Cir.\n2006). This is just such a case where the agency’s original\nclaim for Chevron deference—before the agency’s control\nswitched—would have been rejected at Chevron step two; a\nmuscular use of that analysis is a barrier to inappropriate\nadministrative adventure.\n\f    PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting as to Sections II.B\nthrough II.F and concurring in part:\n     The administrative record is full of compelling evidence\nof dysfunction in the inmate-calling marketplace, with harsh\nconsequences for inmates and their families. The rule under\nreview began with a 2000 lawsuit filed by inmates, family\nmembers, loved ones, and counsel (referred to in these\nproceedings as the Wright Petitioners). Finally acting on the\nWright Petitioners’ concerns, the FCC in 2015 modestly\ncurtailed exorbitant per-minute calling rates and limited\nproviders’ ability to extract confusing and unrelated ancillary\nfees—amounting to as much as 38 percent of total inmate-\ncalling revenue—for such things as setting up an account,\nfunding an account, issuing a refund, and closing an account.\nSee 30 FCC Rcd. 12763, 12838-42 (2015). The record shows\nthat these high prices impair the ability of inmates, by\ndefinition isolated physically from the outside world, to sustain\nfragile filaments of connection to families and communities\nthat they might hope to rejoin. The majority’s decision scuttles\na long-term effort to rein in calling costs that are not\nmeaningfully subject to competition and that profit off of\ninmates’ desperation for connection.\n     The majority’s path to that result is flawed. I cannot agree\nthat a company is “fairly compensated” under 47 U.S.C.\n§ 276(b)(1)(A) when it charges inmates exorbitant prices to use\npayphones inside prisons and jails, shielded from competition\nby a contract granting it a facility-wide payphone monopoly.\nThe majority does not question that Congress enacted the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 to combat phone\nmonopolies, facilitate competition, and thereby ensure better\nservice at lower prices to consumers. Consistent with the 1996\nAct’s general approach of “replac[ing] a state-regulated\nmonopoly system with a federally facilitated, competitive\nmarket,” section 276 of the Act specifically addressed defects\nin the intrastate and interstate payphone market (now largely\nobsolete except in cellphone-free environments such as\n\f                                2\nprisons). New England Pub. Commc’ns Council, Inc. v. FCC,\n334 F.3d 69, 77 (D.C. Cir. 2003).\n     The majority holds it beyond debate that “fairly\ncompensated” is not about fairness to the consumer. It sees no\nstatutory support for the FCC’s effort to require fairer intrastate\nrates for inmates because it reads section 276’s fair-\ncompensation mandate as unambiguously one-sided, only\nempowering the FCC to enhance unfairly low, not to reduce\nunfairly high, compensation for calls. It accepts Global\nTel*Link’s characterization of section 276 as nothing but a “no\nfree calls” provision, Oral Arg. Tr. 40:55, confined to the\nenacting Congress’s acknowledged concern about independent\npayphone providers going uncompensated for certain calls.\nBut that reading is truncated. As it typically does, Congress\nresponded to a particular problem by enacting a law that speaks\nin more general terms: here, by requiring that payphone calls\nin prisons and elsewhere be “fairly compensated.” It did so for\nthe stated purpose—fully relevant here—of promoting\ncompetition among payphone providers to expand the\navailability of payphone services to consumers. 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1).\n     The majority offers one plausible reading of section 276,\nbut it is assuredly not the only one. Congress has not “directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue” in this case, so the\nquestion for us is whether the FCC’s view when it promulgated\nthe challenged rule—that section 276 grants authority not only\nto raise inadequate rates but also to reduce excessive,\nmonopoly-driven rates—was a “permissible construction of\nthe statute.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). I think it was. If the FCC\nunder new management wishes by notice and comment to\nchange its rule, the statute gives it latitude to do so. We should\nuphold the rule that is on the books and leave to the agency to\ndecide whether and how to change it.\n\f                                 3\n                                 I.\n     The FCC reasonably interpreted section 276 to “authorize\nthe Commission to impose intrastate rate caps as prescribed in\nthe Order.” Op. at 20-21. Congress instructed the FCC to\n“establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all\npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each\nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their\npayphone[s].” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A). To begin with,\nnobody contests that authority to establish “a per call\ncompensation plan” includes some authority over end-user\ncalling rates. Indeed, this court already so held. See Illinois\nPublic Telecommunications Ass’n v. FCC, 117 F.3d 555, 562\n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (“Because … there is no indication that the\nCongress intended to exclude local coin rates from the term\n‘compensation’ in § 276, we hold that the statute\nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate\nthe rates for local coin calls.”). And the plain text of the statute\ngrants that authority over both intrastate and interstate\npayphone services, including “inmate telephone service in\ncorrectional institutions.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(d). Thus, the only\ndispute is whether the word “fairly” implies an ability to reduce\nexcesses, as well as bolster deficiencies, in the compensation\nthat payphone providers would otherwise receive.\n     Importantly, Congress chose “fairly” rather than, say,\n“adequately,” “sufficiently,” or “amply.” Those words have\ndifferent meanings. Had it used any of the latter three terms, I\nwould agree that Congress only authorized regulation to\nprevent under-compensation, but its choice of the word “fairly”\ndenotes no such limitation. Compare WEBSTER’S NEW\nCOLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 407 (1980) (defining “fair” as, inter\nalia, “marked by impartiality and honesty: free from self-\ninterest, prejudice, or favoritism”), with id. at 14 (defining\n“adequate” as, inter alia, “sufficient for a specific\nrequirement”), and id. at 1156 (defining “sufficient” as, inter\n\f                               4\nalia, “enough to meet the needs of a situation or a proposed\nend”). Those words are also used differently in everyday\nlanguage. See Schindler Elevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel. Kirk,\n563 U.S. 401, 407 (2011) (court looks to “ordinary meaning”\nin absence of statutory definition). If a grocer demanded $20\nfor a banana, we might call that price adequate, sufficient, or\nample—but nobody would call it fair.\n      The statutory context shows that Congress’ choice of the\nword “fairly” reasonably connotes its concern for unfairly\nexcessive as well as deficient compensation. Elsewhere in the\nCommunications Act, Congress used the term “fair” in\nconjunction with “just” and “reasonable”—familiar terms of\nart used in connection with rate-setting authority. See 47\nU.S.C. § 204(b) (providing for partial authorization of new\ncharges, which would otherwise be stayed, if the FCC\ndetermines “that such partial authorization is just, fair, and\nreasonable”); id. § 205(a) (authorizing the FCC to prescribe\n“what classification, regulation, or practice is or will be just,\nfair, and reasonable”). And the fact that section 276 is one of\nseveral “Special Provisions Concerning Bell Operating\nCompanies,” see Op. at 9, does not suggest that Congress\nexclusively intended to regulate the relationship between\nBOCs and non-BOCs to boost the latter’s compensation and\nwas wholly unconcerned about the risk that callers would be\ncharged excessive rates.\n     The purpose and history behind the congressional action\nhere comport with this reading of the statutory text and context.\nIn passing the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Congress aimed\nto “promot[e] competition in the payphone service industry.”\nNew England, 334 F.3d at 71; see also 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)\n(stating congressional purpose “to promote competition among\npayphone service providers and promote the widespread\ndeployment of payphone services to the benefit of the general\npublic”).    To be sure, the immediate anti-competitive\n\f                               5\nmalfunction confronting Congress at the time was that certain\npayphone providers were, under certain circumstances, under-\ncompensated. See Illinois Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v. FCC, 752\nF.3d 1018, 1026 (D.C. Cir. 2014). But the central aim was to\nadvance competition to the benefit of the end users of payphone\nservices. Senator Kerry, for instance, explained that his goal in\nintroducing section 276 was “to establish a level playing field\nfor independent payphone providers,” and thereby to enable\ncompetition “on the basis of price, quality and service, rather\nthan on marketshare and subsidies.” 3 Reams & Manz, Federal\nTelecommunications Law: A Legislative History of the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110\nStat. 56 (1996), at S710.\n     Consistent with that pro-competitive agenda, the FCC and\nthis court have long assumed that section 276 provides tools for\naddressing monopoly power and market failure in the\npayphone market. For instance, in Illinois, the state petitioners\nargued that the FCC had unlawfully ignored the problem of\n“locational monopolies,” that is, situations in which a\npayphone provider “obtains an exclusive contract for the\nprovision of all payphones at an isolated location, such as an\nairport, stadium, or mall, and is thereby able to charge an\ninflated rate for local calls made from that location.” 117 F.3d\nat 562. We recognized that the FCC had not ignored the\nproblem of locational monopolies; it had simply “concluded\nthat it would deal with them if and when specific [providers]\nare shown to have substantial market power.” Id. Now, twenty\nyears later, the FCC has identified a discrete area where\npayphone providers do have substantial market power: prisons\nand jails. The inmate-calling market is, the FCC found, “a\nprime example of market failure” because, instead of\ncompeting to reduce rates and improve services for callers,\nproviders compete to offer ever-higher site commissions to\ncorrectional facilities so as to gain monopoly access to a\nliterally captive consumer base. 30 FCC Rcd. at 12765 & n.9.\n\f                                 6\n     Nevertheless, the majority cites four considerations that\ninfluenced its rejection of the FCC’s claimed authority over\nintrastate inmate calling services. Op. at 21-24. None is\ncompelling.\n     First, the majority notes that section 152(b) “erects a\npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory\nauthority over intrastate communications.” Op. at 21 (citing\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 373\n(1986)). That is true, but section 276, by its plain terms,\n“overcom[es] this presumption.” Op. at 21. Congress\ninstructed the FCC to ensure fair compensation for all\npayphone calls—interstate and intrastate. 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1)(A). To that end, Congress expressly provided for\npreemption of inconsistent state regulation. Id. § 276(c). This\ncase is thus unlike Louisiana, which held that federal power\nover depreciation charges pursuant to section 220 was limited\nto the interstate ratemaking context; it is simply not “possible”\nhere that section 276 “do[es] no more than spell out the\nauthority of the FCC . . . in the context of interstate regulation.”\nLouisiana, 476 U.S. at 377. Whatever section 276 means, it\napplies in both the interstate and intrastate contexts. Cf. N.Y.\n& Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y. v. FCC, 267 F.3d 91, 102-03 (2d\nCir. 2001) (concluding that section 251(e) clearly “grants the\nFCC authority to act with respect to those areas of intrastate\nservice encompassed by the terms ‘North American\nNumbering Plan’ and ‘numbering administration,’” and\napplying Chevron deference to agency’s interpretation of\n“what either term encompasses”).\n     Second, the majority says that “the Order erroneously\ntreats the Commission’s authority under § 201 and § 276 as\ncoterminous.” Op. at 21. My colleagues appear to draw that\nconclusion from the FCC’s repeated use of the phrase “just,\nreasonable, and fair”—an amalgam of the two provisions’ key\nterms. As I read the Order, the bundling of those three words\n\f                               7\nsimply reflects that the FCC’s authority over inmate calling\nderives from the sum of those authorizations. The majority’s\ninference that the Order fails to respect the difference between\nsections 201 and 276, and in particular, fails to appreciate that\nsection 201 applies only to interstate rates, has no support in\nthe record.\n     Third, the majority concludes that the FCC erred in finding\nsupport for its approach in prior agency orders. Op. at 22-23.\nThe majority says that “the prior orders . . . focused on\npayphone providers and carriers to determine whether the\nproviders were fairly compensated.” Op. at 23. But this court\nhas held that “compensation” includes end-user rates; it is not\nlimited to payments between payphone providers and carriers.\nIllinois, 117 F.3d at 562 (“[W]e hold that the statute\nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate\nthe rates for local coin calls.”).\n     Fourth, the majority says the FCC mistakenly relied on this\ncourt’s decisions in Illinois and New England. Op. at 24-26.\nThe majority acknowledges that Illinois “held that § 276\nunambiguously overrode § 152(b)’s presumption against\nintrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted the Commission\nauthority to ‘set’ reimbursement rates for local coin calls in\norder to ensure that payphone operators who were previously\nuncompensated were ‘fairly compensated.’” Op. at 24.\nAccording to the majority, however, setting rates to increase\nproviders’ compensation is different from reducing “already\ncompensatory rates.” Op. at 25. Yet Illinois ratified the FCC’s\nassertion of authority to regulate “locational monopolies.” 117\nF.3d at 562. The majority responds that the FCC never said it\nwould consider intrastate rate caps as the means of breaking up\nsuch monopolies. See Op. at 25. But the FCC, as we noted in\nIllinois, “specifically reserved the right to modify its\nderegulation scheme, for example, by limiting the number of\ncompensable calls from each payphone.” 117 F.3d at 563.\n\f                                8\nLimiting the number of compensable calls per phone is, of\ncourse, economically similar to limiting the rate per call; either\nincentivizes broader deployment of payphones to maintain the\nsame revenue levels. Thus, the FCC contemplated, and the\nCourt approved, just the sort of pro-consumer regulation the\nFCC eventually undertook in the Order under review.\n     Petitioners argue that in the rule at issue in Illinois, the\nFCC had merely claimed the authority “to adjust the per-call\ncompensation scheme that the FCC itself put in place to ensure\nfair compensation,” not the “authority to regulate existing\nmarket rates.” ICS Pet’rs Br. 46 n.31. That is a false\ndichotomy. Cf. Illinois, 117 F.3d at 563 (“A market-based\napproach is as much a compensation scheme as a rate-setting\napproach.”). The bottom line is that the FCC anticipated the\nproblem of monopoly power in the provision of payphone\nservices, and this Court ratified the agency’s authority to\ncombat that problem by reducing providers’ compensation,\nincluding by adjusting end-user rates. There is thus no basis\nfor the majority’s contention that “the FCC consistently\nconstrued its authority over intrastate payphone rates as limited\nto addressing the problem of under-compensation for ICS\nproviders.” Op. at 5.\n     The majority also takes issue with the Order’s invocation\nof New England, but the FCC correctly relied on that precedent\nfor the limited point that “section 276 unambiguously and\nstraightforwardly authorizes the Commission to regulate [the\nBell Operating Companies’] intrastate payphone line rates.” 30\nFCC Rcd. at 12815 (quoting 334 F.3d at 75). The fact that the\nFCC and this court previously articulated section 276 authority\nin terms of generic rate regulation is relevant here. And,\ncontrary to the majority, New England’s holding that section\n276(b)(1)(C) does not apply to non-Bell Operating Companies\nhas no resonance in this case. The provision at issue here,\nsection 276(b)(1)(A), is indisputably applicable to non-BOCs:\n\f                                9\nit requires that “all payphone service providers [be] fairly\ncompensated.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).\n     None of this is to suggest that the FCC has the same “broad\nplenary authority to regulate and cap intrastate rates” that it has\nover interstate rates. Op. at 26. Notably, whereas section 201\nbroadly requires that “[a]ll charges, practices, classifications,\nand regulations for and in connection with [interstate]\ncommunication service[] shall be just and reasonable,” section\n276 is more narrowly focused on “compensation.” The FCC\nsimply did not need “broad plenary authority” to conclude that\ninmate calling service providers charging as much as $56.00\nfor a four-minute call, see Op. at 11, were not being “fairly\ncompensated.”\n                                II.\n     The majority also holds that the FCC’s complete exclusion\nof site commissions from its cost calculus and its use of\nindustry-wide averages were arbitrary and capricious. See Op.\nat 28-33. It is unclear why the majority finds it necessary to\naddress how the caps were calculated, given its rejection of the\nFCC’s power to cap at all. In any event, the majority’s analysis\nis misguided.\n     Regarding site commissions, the majority says that\n“[i]gnoring costs that the Commission acknowledges to be\nlegitimate is implausible.” Op. at 29. But the FCC did not\nacknowledge site commissions as legitimate costs. Quite to the\ncontrary, the FCC agreed with a commenter who described site\ncommissions as “legal bribes to induce correctional agencies to\nprovide ICS providers with lucrative monopoly contracts.” 30\nFCC Rcd. at 12821. In other words, the FCC viewed site\ncommissions not as real costs of doing business, but as “an\napportionment of profit” between providers and correctional\nfacilities. Id. at 12822. The majority suggests that if site\ncommissions are “directly related to the provision” of inmate\n\f                              10\ncalling services in that they are conditions of receiving\ncontracts to provide such services, they are “therefore\nlegitimate.” Op. at 30. That equation makes no sense; the fact\nthat a cost was charged under a prior regulatory regime cannot\nmean the agency is required to recognize that cost as\n“legitimate” and is disempowered from regulating it.\n     Simply put, the fact that a state may demand them does not\nmake site commissions a legitimate cost of providing calling\nservices. The majority asserts that “[i]n some instances,\ncommissions are mandated by state statute,” Op. at 29, but the\nrecord reflects that there is only one such statute, Tex. Gov’t\nCode Ann. § 495.027(a)(2). That statute categorically\ndemands site commissions of at least 40 per cent of the\nprovider’s gross revenue, which only illustrates the problem\nthat site commissions are a form of monopoly rent not tied to\nactual costs.\n     Indeed, considering site commissions as a compensable\ncost would effectively negate the FCC’s authority to mitigate\nlocational monopolies. Imagine that a payphone provider (in\nthe pre-cell phone era) contracted with a large stadium to\nprovide just three payphones, anticipating that its monopoly\nwould enable it to charge several dollars per minute while\nkicking back some percentage to the stadium. Plainly, the\nstatutory goals of “competition” and “widespread deployment\nof payphone services” could be well served by a rule imposing\nreasonable, market-sensitive price caps to spur providers to\noffer more phones to maintain the same levels of revenue. 47\nU.S.C. § 276(b)(1). But any such price cap would be worthless\nif it had to be calculated to ensure that the provider could\ncontinue its kickbacks to the stadium.            The kickback\narrangement might, in some sense, be “related” to the provision\nof payphone services at the stadium, but it is not “reasonably”\nrelated because acceding to such preexisting contractual\nrelationships is inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\n\f                                11\n    On the averaging issue, the majority concludes that\nbecause the Order “makes calls with above-average costs . . .\nunprofitable,” it “does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that\n‘each and every’ inter- and intrastate call be fairly\ncompensated.” Op. at 32. This holding seems to follow from\nthe majority’s pinched interpretation of section 276 as a one-\nway ratchet whereby providers are always entitled to recoup\n“actual” costs incurred under monopoly conditions, no matter\nhow extravagant. As I have explained, I believe that section\n276 conveys some authority to lower rates, which means the\nFCC need not take as given “calls with above-average costs.”\n      Additionally, the majority fails to reckon with the FCC’s\nindependent authority to cap rates for interstate calls under\nsection 201, despite acknowledging that this power is “broad”\nand “plenary.” Op. at 26. In my view, the FCC has wide\ndiscretion under its section 201 “just and reasonable” interstate\nratemaking authority to decide which costs to take into account\nand to use industry-wide averages that do not necessarily\ncompensate “each and every” call, as section 276 requires. See\nNat’l Ass’n of Regulatory Util. Comm’rs v. FERC, 475 F.3d\n1277, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (agency is not “weaponless\nagainst conduct that might encourage or cloak the running up\nof unreasonable costs”). As the state petitioners aptly\nsummarized, section 201 “gave the Commission broad\nregulatory authority over interstate communication in a\n‘traditional form,’ mirroring regulation of railroads and public\nutilities, enabling it to set rates to allow a monopolistic utility\nto recover a reasonable profit but also protect the consumer\nfrom unjustly high prices.” State Pet’rs Br. at 28-29. The\nmajority never explains why the FCC’s rate-setting\nmethodology would be impermissible as to the interstate caps.\n                               III.\n     Finally, I note that the majority offers no persuasive reason\nfor abandoning the Chevron framework (which it admittedly\n\f                                12\ndoes only in dicta, as Chevron deference plays no role in an\nopinion holding section 276 unambiguous). It acknowledges\nthat the Order is “presumptively subject” to deferential review,\nbut then concludes that “it would make no sense for this court\nto determine whether the disputed agency positions advanced\nin the Order warrant Chevron deference when the agency has\nabandoned those positions.” Op. at 18. Absent any briefing on\nthe subject or any citation to precedent, I cannot agree.\n     The FCC, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, took\ncertain positions—most notably that section 276 authorizes\nregulation of the fairness of intrastate inmate-calling rates—\nand defended them vigorously in briefing before this court.\nLess than a month before argument, the court on its own motion\ndirected the parties to explain whether this case should be held\nin abeyance in light of recent personnel changes at the FCC.\nThe FCC responded that the court should “move forward on\nthe current schedule.” Doc. No. 1656116 (Jan. 17, 2017). Two\nweeks later, and just a week before argument, the FCC\ninformed us that it would no longer defend certain points that\nit had briefed, but that the Wright Petitioners would “defend all\naspects of the Order.” Doc. No. 1658521 (Jan. 31, 2017). The\nFCC has not committed to formally reviewing the Order, as\nother similarly situated agencies have recently done. See, e.g.,\nMurray Energy Corp. v. EPA, No. 15-1385, Doc. No. 1670218\n(April 7, 2017) (requesting postponement of oral argument so\nthat agency could “fully review” the relevant rule). By\nsuggesting that agencies can relinquish judicial deference\nthrough such limited and belated maneuvers as refusing to\ndefend portions of their briefs during oral argument, the\nmajority risks enabling agencies to end-run the principle that\nthey must “use the same procedures when they amend or repeal\na rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.” Perez\nv. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 135 S. Ct. 1199, 1206 (2015).\n                              ***\n\f                               13\n     The majority appears to leave an opening for the FCC—\non some other record and by some other reasoning—to rein in\nexcessive inmate-calling rates, both interstate and intrastate.\nSee Op. at 20, 29, 32 (limiting its analysis to the record in this\ncase). And the majority invites the FCC to determine whether\nsome “portions of site commissions” are illegitimate and non-\ncompensable. Op. at 30. Still, because the majority\nshortchanges the FCC’s authority to reduce excessive,\nmonopoly-driven rates, finds “implausible” the agency’s\nreasoned approach to a grave problem, and unnecessarily\nsuggests limitations on Chevron deference, I respectfully\ndissent from Sections II.B through II.F of the majority opinion.\n\f",

In the Telecommunications Act of 1996\n(“1996 Act”), Congress amended the 1934 Act to change the\nCommission’s limited regulatory authority over intrastate\n\f                                5\ntelecommunication so as to promote competition in the\npayphone industry.\n\n     Before the passage of the 1996 Act, Bell Operating\nCompanies (“BOCs”) had dominated the payphone industry to\nthe detriment of other providers. Congress sought to remedy\nthis situation by authorizing the Commission to adopt\nregulations ensuring that all payphone providers are “fairly\ncompensated for each and every” interstate and intrastate call.\n47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A). “[P]ayphone service” expressly\nincludes “the provision of inmate telephone service in\ncorrectional institutions, and any ancillary services.” Id.\n§ 276(d). The issues in this case focus on inmate calling\nservices (“ICS”) and the rates and fees charged for these calls.\n\n     Following the passage of the 1996 Act, the Commission\navoided intrusive regulatory measures for ICS. And prior to the\nOrder under review in this case, the Commission had never\nsought to impose rate caps on intrastate calls. Rather, the FCC\nconsistently construed its authority over intrastate payphone\nrates as limited to addressing the problem of under-\ncompensation for ICS providers.\n\n     Due to a variety of market failures in the prison and jail\npayphone industry, however, inmates in correctional facilities,\nor those to whom they placed calls, incurred prohibitive per-\nminute charges and ancillary fees for payphone calls. In the\nface of this problem, the Commission decided to change its\napproach to the regulation of ICS providers. In 2015, in the\nOrder under review, the Commission set permanent rate caps\nand ancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls and, for the first\ntime, imposed those caps on intrastate ICS calls. Rates for\nInterstate Inmate Calling Services (“Order”), 30 FCC Rcd.\n12763, 12775–76, 12838–62 (Nov. 5, 2015), 80 Fed. Reg.\n79136-01 (Dec. 18, 2015). The Commission also proposed to\n\f                               6\nexpand the reach of its ICS regulations by banning or limiting\nfees for billing and collection services – so-called “ancillary\nfees” – and by regulating video services and other advanced\nservices in addition to traditional calling services.\n\n    Five inmate payphone providers, joined by state and local\nauthorities, now challenge the Order’s design to expand the\nFCC’s regulatory authority. In particular, the Petitioners\nchallenge the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates, the\nexclusion of “site commissions” as costs in the agency’s\nratemaking methodology, the use of industry-averaged cost\ndata in the FCC’s calculation of rate caps, the imposition of\nancillary fee caps, and reporting requirements. And one ICS\nprovider separately challenges the Commission’s failure to\npreempt inconsistent state rates and raises a due process\nchallenge.\n\n     Following the presidential inauguration in January 2017,\ncounsel for the FCC advised the court that, due to a change in\nthe composition of the Commission, “a majority of the current\nCommission does not believe that the agency has the authority\nto cap intrastate rates under section 276 of the Act.” Counsel\nthus informed the court that the agency was “abandoning . . .\nthe contention . . . that the Commission has the authority to cap\nintrastate rates” for ICS providers. Counsel also informed the\ncourt that the FCC was abandoning its contention “that the\nCommission lawfully considered industry-wide averages in\nsetting the rate caps.” However, the Commission has not\nrevoked, withdrawn, or suspended the Order. And one of the\nIntervenors on behalf of the Commission, the “Wright\nPetitioners,” continues to press the points that have been\nabandoned by the Commission.\n\n    For the reasons set forth below, we grant in part and deny\nin part the petitions for review, and remand for further\n\f                               7\nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss\ntwo claims as moot.\n\n   We hold that the Order’s proposed caps on intrastate rates\n    exceed the FCC’s statutory authority under the 1996 Act.\n    We therefore vacate this provision.\n\n   We further hold that the use of industry-averaged cost data\n    as proposed in the Order is arbitrary and capricious because\n    it lacks justification in the record and is not supported by\n    reasoned decisionmaking. We therefore vacate this\n    provision.\n\n   We additionally hold that the Order’s imposition of video\n    visitation reporting requirements is beyond the statutory\n    authority of the Commission. We therefore vacate this\n    provision.\n\n   We find that the Order’s proposed wholesale exclusion of\n    site commission payments from the FCC’s cost calculus is\n    devoid of reasoned decisionmaking and thus arbitrary and\n    capricious. This provision cannot stand as presently\n    proposed in the Order under review; we therefore vacate\n    this provision and remand for further proceedings on the\n    matter.\n\n   We deny the petitions for review of the Order’s site\n    commission reporting requirements.\n\n   We remand the challenge to the Order’s imposition of\n    ancillary fee caps to allow the Commission to determine\n    whether it can segregate proposed caps on interstate calls\n    (which are permissible) and the proposed caps on intrastate\n    calls (which are impermissible).\n\f                               8\n   Finally, we dismiss the preemption and due process claims\n    as moot.\n\n                    I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA. Statutory Background\n\n    The 1934 Act, 47 U.S.C. § 151, et seq., established a system\nof regulatory authority that divides power between individual\nstates and the FCC over inter- and intrastate telephone\ncommunication services. New England Pub. Commc’ns\nCouncil, Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186004\"><a href=\"/opinion/186004/new-engl-pub-comm-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Under\nthis statutory scheme, the Commission regulates interstate\ntelephone communication. See id.; 47 U.S.C. § 151. This\nregulatory authority includes ensuring that all charges “in\nconnection with” interstate calls are “just and reasonable.” 47\nU.S.C. § 201(b). “The Commission may prescribe such rules\nand regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to\ncarry out” these provisions. Id.\n\n     The FCC, however, “is generally forbidden from entering\nthe field of intrastate communication service, which remains\nthe province of the states.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75\n(citing 47 U.S.C. § 152(b)). Section 152(b) of the 1934 Act\nerects a presumption against the Commission’s assertion of\nregulatory authority over intrastate communications. This is\n“not only a substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s\npower, but also a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting\nthe Act’s provisions. La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111672\"><a href=\"/opinion/111672/louisiana-pub-serv-commn-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373 (1986).\n\n    The 1996 Act “fundamentally restructured the local\ntelephone industry,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71, by\nchanging the FCC’s authority with respect to some intrastate\nactivities and “remov[ing] a significant area from the States’\n\f                             9\nexclusive control,” AT&T Corp. v.

Nevertheless, the states still primarily\n“reign supreme over intrastate rates.” New England Pub., 334\nF.3d at 75 (quoting City of Brookings Mun. Tel. Co. v. FCC,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490901\"><a href=\"/opinion/490901/city-of-brookings-municipal-telephone-company-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). “Insofar as Congress\nhas remained silent . . . § 152(b) continues to function. The\nCommission could not, for example, regulate any aspect of\nintrastate communication not governed by the 1996 Act on the\ntheory that it had an ancillary effect on matters within the\nCommission’s primary jurisdiction.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at\n382 n.8.\n\n     Although the strictures of § 152 remain in force, the\nchanges imposed by the 1996 Act were significant. Evidence\nof this is seen in the “Special Provisions Concerning Bell\nOperating Companies.” 47 U.S.C. §§ 271–76. Section 276 was\n“specifically aimed at promoting competition in the payphone\nservice industry.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. While\nlocal phone services were once thought to be natural\nmonopolies, “[t]echnological advances . . . made competition\namong multiple providers of local service seem possible, and\nCongress [in the 1996 Act] ended the longstanding regime of\nstate-sanctioned monopolies.” AT&T Corp., 525 U.S. at 371;\nsee also Glob. Crossing Telecomms., Inc. v. Metrophones\nTelecomms., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145746\"><a href=\"/opinion/145746/global-crossing-telecom-v-metrophones/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (2007).\n\n    The market history is illuminating. After AT&T had\ndivested its local exchange carriers into individual BOCs in\n1982, BOCs continued to discriminate against non-BOC\npayphone providers and effectively foreclosed competition.\nThe BOCs accomplished this by generally making sure that\nother providers were not compensated for calls using BOC-\nowned payphone lines. See New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71.\nThus, because technology constraints forced many non-BOC\nproviders to use BOC-owned payphone lines, those providers\n\f                              10\nwere often left uncompensated for payphone calls. The 1996\nAct changed these market practices.\n\n     In § 276, Congress clearly aimed to “promote competition\namong payphone service providers and promote the\nwidespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit of\nthe general public.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1). Covered payphone\nservices include “inmate telephone service in correctional\ninstitutions, and any ancillary services.” Id. § 276(d). Section\n276 of the 1996 Act authorizes the Commission “to prescribe\nregulations consistent with the goal of promoting competition,\nrequiring that the Commission take five specific steps toward\nthat goal.” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. One such step is\nto “establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all\npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each\nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their\npayphone,” and to prescribe regulations to establish this\ncompensation plan by November 1996. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1),\n(b)(1)(A). The remaining four steps further encourage or force\ncompetition between BOC and non-BOC providers. Id.\n§ 276(b)(1)(B)–(E). Any state requirements that are\ninconsistent with FCC’s regulations adopted pursuant to § 276\nare preempted. Id. § 276(c).\n\nB. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n    Over the years, payphone providers have sought to provide\ninmate calling services to inmates in prisons and jails\nnationwide. ICS providers now compete with one another to\nwin bids for long-term ICS contracts with correctional\nfacilities. In awarding contracts to providers, correctional\nfacilities usually give considerable weight to which provider\noffers the highest site commission, which is typically a portion\nof the provider’s revenue or profits. See Implementation of Pay\nTel. Reclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of\n\f                              11\n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 3248, 3252–53 (2002). Site commissions\napparently range between 20% and 63% of the providers’\nprofits, but can exceed that amount. Id. at 3253 n.34. And ICS\nproviders pay over $460 million in site commissions annually.\nOrder, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12821.\n\n    Once a long-term, exclusive contract bid is awarded to an\nICS provider, competition ceases for the duration of the\ncontract and subsequent contract renewals. Winning ICS\nproviders thus operate locational monopolies with a captive\nconsumer base of inmates and the need to pay high site\ncommissions. See 17 FCC Rcd. at 3253. After a decade of\nindustry consolidation, three specialized ICS firms now control\n85% of the market. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12801. And ICS\nper-minute rates and ancillary fees together are extraordinarily\nhigh, with some rates as high as $56.00 for a four-minute call.\nId. at 12765 n.4.\n\n    In reviewing this market situation, the FCC found that\ninmate calling services are “a prime example of market\nfailure.” Id. at 12765. In its brief to this court, FCC counsel\naptly explains the seriousness of the situation:\n\n   Inmates and their families cannot choose for\n   themselves the inmate calling provider on whose\n   services they rely to communicate. Instead,\n   correctional facilities each have a single provider of\n   inmate calling services. And very often, correctional\n   authorities award that monopoly franchise based\n   principally on what portion of inmate calling revenues\n   a provider will share with the facility—i.e., on the\n   payment of “site commissions.” Accordingly, inmate\n   calling providers compete to offer the highest site\n   commission payments, which they recover through\n   correspondingly higher end-user rates. See [Order, 30\n\f                               12\n   FCC Rcd. at 12818–21]. If inmates and their families\n   wish to speak by telephone, they have no choice but to\n   pay the resulting rates.\n\nBr. for FCC at 4.\n\n    In February 2000, Intervenor Martha Wright filed a\nputative class action against ICS providers on behalf of her\ngrandson, other inmates, and their loved ones to challenge ICS\nrates and fees. Complaint, Wright, et al. v. Corr. Corp. of Am.,\nNo. 1:00-CV-00293 (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 2000). In 2001, the\nDistrict Court stayed the case to afford the FCC the opportunity\nto consider the reasonableness of ICS rates in the first instance\nthrough rulemaking. Thereafter, in 2003 and in 2007, Martha\nWright and others petitioned the Commission for rulemaking\nto regulate ICS rates and fees. Petition for Rulemaking, FCC\nNo. 96-128 (Nov. 3, 2003); Petitioners’ Alternative\nRulemaking Proposal, FCC No. 96-128 (Mar. 1, 2007).\n\n   The record compiled by the Commission fairly clearly\nsupports its determination that ICS charges raise serious\nconcerns. As noted in the FCC’s brief to the court:\n\n      Excessive rates for inmate calling deter\n   communication between inmates and their families,\n   with substantial and damaging social consequences.\n   Inmates’ families may be forced to choose between\n   putting food on the table or paying hundreds of dollars\n   each month to keep in touch. See [Order, 30 FCC Rcd.\n   at 12766–67]. When incarcerated parents lack regular\n   contact with their children, those children—2.7 million\n   of them nationwide—have higher rates of truancy,\n   depression, and poor school performance. See [id. at\n   12766–67 & 12767 n.18]. Barriers to communication\n   from high inmate calling rates interfere with inmates’\n\f                                13\n    ability to consult their attorneys, see [id. at 12765],\n    impede family contact that can “make[] prisons and\n    jails safer spaces,” [id. at 12767], and foster\n    recidivism, see [id. at 12766–67].\n\nBr. for FCC at 4–5. Petitioners do not seriously contest these\nfacts. See Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 7 (acknowledging that “calling\nrates often exceed, sometimes substantially, rates for ordinary\ntoll calls”).\n\n    In 2013, the Commission issued an interim order imposing\na per-minute rate cap for interstate ICS calls, citing its plenary\nauthority over interstate calls under § 201(b) and its mandate\nto ensure that providers are “fairly compensated” under § 276.\nRates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services (“Interim Order”),\n28 FCC Rcd. 14107, 14114–15 (2013). ICS providers\npetitioned for this court’s review of the Interim Order. The\ncourt stayed application of certain portions of the Interim\nOrder but allowed its interstate rate caps to remain in effect.\nOrder, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No. 13-1280 (“Securus I”) (D.C.\nCir. Jan. 13, 2014), ECF No. 1474764 (staying only 47 C.F.R.\n§§ 64.6010, 64.6020, and 64.6060). In December 2014, the\ncourt held the petitions in abeyance while the Commission\nproceeded to set permanent rates. Order, Securus I (D.C. Cir.\nDec. 16, 2014), ECF No. 1527663.\n\n    In 2015, the Commission set permanent rate caps and\nancillary fee caps for interstate ICS calls, and for the first time\nthe agency imposed caps on intrastate ICS calls. Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12775–76, 12838–62. The rate caps were set for four\ncategories – “all prisons” and three tiers of jails based on size\n– and the rate caps varied by category. Id. at 12770. The rate\ncaps, which were made effective immediately, ranged from\n$.14 to $.49 per minute, but were to decrease as of July 1, 2018,\nto $.11 to $.22 per minute. Id. In setting the rate caps, the\n\f                              14\nCommission used a ratemaking methodology based on\nindustry-average cost data that excluded site commissions as a\ncost. Id. at 12790, 12818–38. The Order also imposed\nreporting requirements on ICS providers, including for video\nvisitation services and site commissions. Id. at 12890–93.\n\n    ICS providers Global Tel*Link; Securus Technologies,\nInc.; CenturyLink Public Communications, Inc.; Telmate,\nLLC; and Pay Tel Communications (“Pay Tel”) (collectively\n“Petitioners”) separately petitioned for review. Various state\nand local correctional authorities, governments, and\ncorrectional facility organizations petitioned and/or intervened\non behalf of Petitioners. Martha Wright’s putative class and\nvarious inmate-related legal organizations (“Intervenors”)\nintervened on behalf of the Commission.\n\n    In early 2016, the court consolidated the petitions for\nreview. On March 7, 2016, the court stayed the application of\nthe Order’s rate caps and ancillary fee caps as to single-call\nservices while this case was pending. Order, Global Tel*Link,\net al. v. FCC, No. 15-1461 (“Global Tel*Link”) (D.C. Cir. Mar.\n7, 2016), ECF No. 1602581. Subsequently, on March 23, 2016,\nthe court stayed the application of the Interim Order to\nintrastate rates. Order, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 23,\n2016), ECF No. 1605455.\n\n   In August 2016, on reconsideration of the FCC’s Order, the\nCommission raised the rate caps to account for a small portion\nof site commissions. Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling\nServices (“Reconsideration Order”), 31 FCC Rcd. 9300\n(2016). ICS providers petitioned for review of the\nReconsideration Order, but the court held those petitions in\nabeyance and stayed the Reconsideration Order pending the\noutcome of this case. See Order, Securus Techs. v. FCC, No.\n\f                                15\n16-1321 (“Securus II”) (D.C. Cir. Nov. 2, 2016), ECF No.\n1644302.\n\n    On January 31, 2017, counsel for the FCC filed a letter\nadvising this court that the Commission had experienced\n“significant changes in [its] composition.” Letter at 1, Global\nTel*Link (D.C. Cir. Jan. 31, 2017), ECF No. 1658521. Of the\nfive Commissioners who had voted on the Order, two of the\nthree Commissioners in the majority had left the FCC. Id.\nBecause the dissent’s position now commanded a majority,\ncounsel for the FCC informed the court that “a majority of the\ncurrent Commission does not believe that the agency has the\nauthority to cap intrastate rates under section 276 of the Act.”\nId. Counsel thus advised the court that the FCC was\n“abandoning . . . the contention . . . that the Commission has\nthe authority to cap intrastate rates” for ICS. Id. Counsel\nadditionally informed the court that the FCC was abandoning\nits contention “that the Commission lawfully considered\nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps.” Id. at 2. At oral\nargument, counsel for the Commission confirmed the agency’s\nabandonment of these aspects of the Order. Tr. of Oral\nArgument at 43–45, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Feb. 6, 2017),\nECF No. 1666379.\n\n                        II. ANALYSIS\n\nA. The Posture of this Case\n\n    The current posture of this case is unusual because counsel\nfor the FCC has advised the court that the agency will not\noppose two of the principal challenges raised by Petitioners\nregarding: (1) the authority of the FCC to set permanent rate\ncaps and ancillary fee caps for intrastate ICS calls; and (2) the\nlegality of the Commission’s consideration of industry-wide\naverages in setting rate caps. In light of the FCC’s change of\n\f                                  16\nposition, a question arises as to whether these challenges are\nmoot.\n\n    It is well established that “voluntary cessation of allegedly\nillegal conduct does not deprive [a judicial] tribunal of power\nto hear and determine the case, i.e., does not make the case\nmoot.” United States v. W.T. Grant Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105132\"><a href=\"/opinion/105132/united-states-v-wt-grant-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632\n(1953). As the Court explained:\n\n   A controversy may remain to be settled in such\n   circumstances, e.g., a dispute over the legality of the\n   challenged practices. The defendant is free to return to\n   his old ways. This, together with a public interest in\n   having the legality of the practices settled, militates\n   against a mootness conclusion. For to say that the case\n   has become moot means that the defendant is entitled\n   to a dismissal as a matter of right. The courts have\n   rightly refused to grant defendants such a powerful\n   weapon against public law enforcement.\n\nId. at 632 (citations omitted).\n\n    “Voluntary cessation” justifies the dismissal of a case on\ngrounds of mootness only when “the defendant can\ndemonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the\nwrong will be repeated. The burden is a heavy one.” Id. at 633\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl.

Cir. 1988)\n(same).\n\n    There is absolutely no basis for dismissing as moot the\nclaims relating to the issues that the FCC has “abandoned.”\nIndeed, neither the FCC, the Petitioners, nor the Intervenors\nhave urged this. The reason is fairly simple: the Order that gave\nrise to the petitions for review is still in force. Although counsel\nfor the FCC has made it clear that the agency will not defend\nportions of the Order, the Commission has never acted to\nrevoke, withdraw, or suspend the Order. Given this posture of\nthe case, it is plain that there has been no “voluntary cessation”\nby the FCC that would warrant dismissal of Petitioners’\nchallenges to the Order.\n\nB. Standard of Review\n\n   Although Petitioners’ challenges to the provisions of the\nOrder purporting to cap intrastate rates and to apply industry-\nwide averages in setting rate caps are not moot, a question\nremains as to what standard governs our review of these\nprovisions. Normally, we would follow the familiar two-step\nChevron framework as the appropriate standard of review. See\nChevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). Under the Chevron framework,\n\n    an agency’s power to regulate “is limited to the scope\n    of the authority Congress has delegated to it.” Am.\n    Library Ass’n v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698 (D.C. Cir.\n    2005). Pursuant to Chevron Step One, if the intent of\n    Congress is clear, the reviewing court must give effect\n    to that unambiguously expressed intent. If Congress\n\f                              18\n   has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,\n   the reviewing court proceeds to Chevron Step Two.\n   Under Step Two, “[i]f Congress has explicitly left a\n   gap for the agency to fill, there is an express delegation\n   of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific\n   provision of the statute by regulation. Such legislative\n   regulations are given controlling weight unless they are\n   . . . manifestly contrary to the statute.” Chevron, 467\n   U.S. at 843–44. Where a “legislative delegation to an\n   agency on a particular question is implicit rather than\n   explicit,” the reviewing court must uphold any\n   “reasonable interpretation made by the administrator\n   of [that] agency.” Id. at 844. But deference to an\n   agency’s interpretation of its enabling statute “is due\n   only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated\n   authority.” Am. Library Ass’n, 406 F.3d at 699.\n\nEDWARDS, ELLIOTT, AND LEVY, FEDERAL STANDARDS                   OF\nREVIEW 166–67 (2d ed. 2013).\n\n    The disputed Order in this case was promulgated by the\nFCC “carrying the force of law.” United States v. Mead Corp.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118450\"><a href=\"/opinion/118450/united-states-v-mead-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226–27 (2001). Therefore, it was presumptively\nsubject to review pursuant to Chevron. Id. The oddity here,\nhowever, is that the agency no longer seeks deference for the\nparts of the Order purporting to cap intrastate rates for ICS\nproviders and to apply industry-wide averages in setting the\nrate caps. In these circumstances, it would make no sense for\nthis court to determine whether the disputed agency positions\nadvanced in the Order warrant Chevron deference when the\nagency has abandoned those positions.\n\n    Although the Chevron framework is of no significance with\nrespect to the cap on intrastate rates and the application of\nindustry-wide averages issues, this does not affect the court’s\n\f                                 19\njurisdiction to address these issues.

The Authority of the FCC to Set Permanent Rate Caps\n   and Ancillary Fee Caps for Intrastate ICS Calls\n\n    In the disputed Order, the Commission asserted authority\nto impose rate caps on intrastate ICS calls for the first time. It\ndid so under the guise of § 276 of the 1996 Act, which requires\nthe Commission to “establish a per call compensation plan to\nensure that all payphone service providers are fairly\ncompensated for each and every completed intrastate and\ninterstate call using their payphone,” and to prescribe\nregulations to establish this compensation plan. 47 U.S.C.\n§ 276(b)(1), (b)(1)(A). Petitioners assert that the provision in\n§ 276, requiring the Commission to ensure that ICS providers\nare “fairly compensated,” does not override the command of\n§ 152(b), which forbids the FCC from asserting jurisdiction\nover “charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or\nregulations for or in connection with intrastate communication\nservice.” 47 U.S.C. § 152(b) (emphasis added). Petitioners also\ncontend that § 276 does not give the Commission ratemaking\nauthority comparable to the authority that it has under § 201 to\nregulate and cap interstate rates. Finally, Petitioners point out\nthat the intrastate rate caps prescribed in the Order make little\nsense in light of the undisputed record evidence showing that\nmany ICS providers have costs that are higher than the disputed\nrate caps. We agree with Petitioners that, on the record in this\ncase, § 276 did not authorize the Commission to impose\n\f                               21\nintrastate rate caps as prescribed in the Order. Several\nconsiderations have influenced our judgment on this matter.\n\n    First, as noted above, § 152(b) of the 1934 Act erects a\npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory\nauthority over intrastate communications. La. Pub. Serv.\nComm’n, 476 U.S. at 373 (making it clear that this is “not only\na substantive jurisdictional limitation on the FCC’s power, but\nalso a rule of statutory construction” in interpreting the Act’s\nprovisions). As we explain below, the Order in this case does\nnot come close to overcoming this presumption in proposing to\ncap intrastate rates.\n\n    Second, the Order erroneously treats the Commission’s\nauthority under § 201 and § 276 as coterminous. Section 201\nimbues the Commission with traditional ratemaking powers\nover interstate calls, including the imposition of rate caps. The\nstatute explicitly directs the FCC to ensure that interstate rates\nare “just and reasonable,” and to “prescribe such rules and\nregulations as may be necessary in the public interest” to carry\nout these provisions. 47 U.S.C. § 201(b). Section 276, however,\ndoes not give the Commission authority to determine “just and\nreasonable” rates. Rather, § 276 merely directs the Commission\nto “ensure that all [ICS] providers are fairly compensated” for\ntheir inter- and intrastate calls. 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A).\n\n    The language and purpose of § 201 in the 1934 Act are\nfundamentally different from the language and purpose of\n§ 276 in the 1996 Act. The Order glosses over these differences\nin declaring that the Commission has authority to ensure that\nrates are “just, reasonable and fair.” See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12766, 12817. This is not what § 201(b) and § 276 say.\nAnd once the Order misquotes the language of § 201(b) and\n§ 276, it goes on to conclude that these provisions in their\ncombined effect authorize the FCC to set rate caps to ensure\n\f                                22\nthat both inter- and intrastate rates are “‘just and reasonable’\nand do not take unfair advantage of inmates, their families, or\nproviders consistent with the ‘fair compensation’ mandate of\nsection 276.” Id. at 12817. In other words, in ignoring the terms\nof § 276, the Order conflates two distinct statutory grants of\nauthority into a synthetic “just, reasonable and fair” standard.\nThis is impermissible.\n\n    Third, the Order asserts that the Commission “has\npreviously found that the term ‘fairly compensated’ [in § 276]\npermits a range of compensation rates . . ., but that the interests\nof both the payphone service providers and the parties paying\nthe compensation must be taken into account,” implying\nconsiderations of fairness to the consumer. Id. at 12814 n.335.\nThis assertion is unfounded. The truth is that the Commission’s\nprior orders align with a narrow reading of the statute that does\nnot purport to treat the Commission’s authority under § 201\nand § 276 as coterminous. The FCC’s prior orders to which the\nOrder here refers construed the “fairly compensated” mandate\nof § 276 as irrelevant to ICS rates reached through contractual\nbargaining. This was because the FCC had determined that\n“whenever a [payphone provider] is able to negotiate for itself\nthe terms of compensation for the calls its payphones originate,\nthen [the Commission’s] statutory obligation to provide fair\ncompensation is satisfied.” Implementation of the Pay Tel.\nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of\n1996, 11 FCC Rcd. 21233, 21269 (1996). This is hardly\nevidence of “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking under § 276.\n\n   Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the Commission’s prior\norders repeatedly acknowledge that § 276 focuses on the\nproblem of uncompensated calls in situations in which BOC\nproviders engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In other\nwords, the FCC recognized that a principal reason for the\nenactment of § 276 was to address “the limitation on the ability\n\f                               23\nof [payphone providers] and carriers to negotiate a mutually\nagreeable amount” because of technological and regulatory\nconstraints. Implementation of the Pay Tel. Reclassification &\nComp. Provisions of the Telecomms. Act of 1996, 14 FCC Rcd.\n2545, 2551, 2569 (1999). Therefore, the prior orders to which\nthe Order at issue here refers focused on payphone providers\nand carriers to determine whether the providers were fairly\ncompensated. See, e.g., id. at 2570; Implementation of Pay Tel.\nReclassification & Comp. Provisions of Telecomms. Act of\n1996, 17 FCC Rcd. 21274, 21302 (2002) (referring to providers\nand the carriers compensating the providers in stating that\n§ 276 “implies fairness to both sides”). The prior orders did not\nreflect anything approaching “just, reasonable and fair”\nratemaking for intrastate rates as authorized by § 201 for\ninterstate rates.\n\n    In the agency brief that was filed with the court before the\nFCC abandoned its support of the intrastate rate caps, counsel\nargued that fairness to the consumer is implied in § 276 because\nthe reference to “fair” (in “fairly compensated”) is “capacious.”\nBr. for FCC at 31. This argument finds no support in the Order.\nAs noted above, the Order simply asserts that intrastate rate\ncaps are consistent with the Commission’s past orders. And, as\nnoted above, the Commission’s past orders do not support a\n“capacious” interpretation of “fairly compensated” in § 276 to\nsuggest that it is comparable to “just, reasonable and fair”\nratemaking in § 201. The prior orders merely relied on the\n“fairly compensated” language to set a default rate from which\nthe payphone providers and carriers could negotiate a\ndeparture, not to reduce bargained-for compensation. See, e.g.,\n11 FCC Rcd. at 21267–69; 14 FCC Rcd. at 2569–71. The\nCommission made it clear that it meant to “g[i]ve primary\nimportance to Congress’s objective of establishing a market-\nbased, deregulatory mechanism for payphone compensation, as\n\f                                24\nrequired both in section 276 and the generally pro-competitive\ngoals of the 1996 Act.” 14 FCC Rcd. at 2548.\n\n    Finally, the Order cites two decisions of this court to justify\nan interpretation of the “fair compensation” mandate in § 276\nthat includes “just and reasonable” ratemaking in § 201. Order,\n30 FCC Rcd. at 12815–16 (citing Ill. Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v.\nFCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743057\"><a href=\"/opinion/743057/illinois-public-telecommunications-association-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (D.C. Cir. 1997); New England Pub.,\n334 F.3d at 75). The Order’s construction of these decisions is\nmisguided because neither decision compels the conclusion\nthat § 276 authorizes the Commission to cap intrastate rates\npursuant to “just, reasonable and fair” ratemaking.\n\n     The Order first extracts language from the decision in\nIllinois saying that § 276 provides the Commission with\n“authority to set local coin call rates.” 117 F.3d at 562. But in\nthe order under review in Illinois, the FCC did not “set” local\ncoin call rates by imposing caps on intrastate rates. Rather, the\nagency merely interpreted the mandate of § 276(b)(1)(A) to\n“require[] the Commission to act only with respect to those\ntypes of calls for which a [payphone provider] does not already\nreceive fair compensation.” Id. at 559 (emphasis added). And\neven for those calls, the FCC ultimately determined a default\nfloor based on the deregulated market rate and allowed the\npayphone providers to negotiate a departure from that rate. Id.\nat 560.\n\n    In reviewing the FCC’s order that was contested in Illinois,\nwe held that § 276 unambiguously overrode § 152(b)’s\npresumption against intrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted\nthe Commission authority to “set” reimbursement rates for\nlocal coin calls in order to ensure that payphone operators who\nwere previously uncompensated were “fairly compensated.”\nId. at 561–63. The court did not say that § 276 overrode the\npresumption against intrastate jurisdiction to allow the\n\f                                25\nCommission to reduce already compensatory rates, which is\nwhat the Order at issue in this case suggests. Rather, the Illinois\ncourt said:\n\n    If locational monopolies turn out to be a problem,\n    however, the Commission suggested some ways in\n    which it might deal with them: a State might be\n    permitted to require competitive bidding for locational\n    contracts, or to mandate that additional [payphone\n    providers] be allowed to provide payphones at the\n    location; and if these remedies fail, the Commission\n    may consider the matter further.\n\nId. at 562–63. None of these options contemplated caps on\nintrastate rates.\n\n     It is true that the decision in Illinois does not explicitly\npreclude the Commission from imposing intrastate rate caps.\nThat was not the question before the court. But the Order at\nissue in this case is wrong in suggesting that the decision in\nIllinois reflects “significant judicial precedent [that] supports\nthe Commission’s authority” to reduce already compensatory\nrates. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12815. Indeed, in Illinois the court\nreversed the Commission’s decision to exclude certain\nuncompensated calls from its mandatory compensation plan\nbecause the failure to provide compensation for this type of\npayphone call was “patently inconsistent with § 276’s\ncommand that fair compensation be provided for ‘each and\nevery completed . . . call.’” 117 F.3d at 566.\n\n    The Order at issue in this case also purports to rely on a\nstatement in the New England decision that § 276\n“unambiguously and straightforwardly authorizes the\nCommission to regulate . . . intrastate payphone line rates.”\nOrder at 12815 (quoting New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 75).\n\f                                26\nBut here again the cited decision merely confirmed that the\n1996 Act expanded the Commission’s intrastate regulatory\nauthority within the limited parameters of § 276. The New\nEngland court held that Congress had authorized the\nCommission to carry out the anti-subsidy and anti-\ndiscrimination mandates of § 276(b)(1)(D)–(E) as to both inter-\nand intrastate payphone providers because Congress intended\n§ 276 as a whole to “authorize the Commission to eliminate\nbarriers to competition.” 334 F.3d at 77. But when pressed to\nextend § 276’s anti-subsidy and anti-discrimination mandates\nto non-BOC carriers, the court said, “the fact remains that\nsections 276(a) and 276(b)(1)(C), the sources of the\nCommission’s authority to regulate intrastate payphone rates,\nexpressly apply only to the BOCs.” Id. at 78. The court was\nalso clear in saying that outside the specific directives of § 276,\ngeneral provisions “cannot . . . trump section 152(b)’s specific\ncommand that no Commission regulations shall preempt state\nregulations unless Congress expressly so indicates. Absent\nauthorization to apply its section 276 regulations to non-BOC\n[carriers], the Commission may not regulate their intrastate\npayphone line rates.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\n    Thus, neither Illinois nor New England stands for the\nproposition that the Commission has broad plenary authority to\nregulate and cap intrastate rates. Rather these decisions confirm\nthe limited scope of § 276 which must be applied within the\nexpress bounds of its specific directives.\n\n    The Order’s misconstruction of our case law stems from its\nfundamental misreading of § 276. The Order acknowledges\nthat the Commission’s authority over intrastate calls is, “except\nas otherwise provided by Congress, generally limited by\nsection [152(b)] of the Act.” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12814. The\nCommission thus recognized that to assert jurisdiction over\nintrastate rates, the 1996 Act must “unambiguously appl[y] to\n\f                                27\nintrastate services.” Id. The Order errs, however, in concluding\nthat § 276 required it “to broadly craft regulations to ‘promote\nthe widespread development of payphone services for the\nbenefit of the general public,’” and that this constituted a\n“general grant of jurisdiction.” Id. (quoting 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1)). This misreads the language of § 276. The statute\nmerely commands the Commission, “[i]n order to promote\ncompetition among payphone service providers and promote\nthe widespread deployment of payphone services to the benefit\nof the general public,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1), to prescribe\nregulations to accomplish “five specific steps toward that\ngoal,” New England Pub., 334 F.3d at 71. This is not a “general\ngrant of jurisdiction” over intrastate ratemaking.\n\n    The Order at issue in this case is legally infirm because it\npurports to cap intrastate rates based on a “just, reasonable and\nfair” test that is not enunciated in the statute, conflates distinct\ngrants of authority under § 201 and § 276, and misreads our\njudicial precedent and the FCC’s own prior orders to support\ncapping already compensatory rates under the guise of ensuring\nproviders are “fairly compensated.” The point here is\nstraightforward:\n\n       The FCC’s belief that lower ICS calling rates reflect\n    desirable social policy cannot justify regulations that\n    exceed its statutory mandate. Section 276 of the\n    Communications Act authorizes the FCC to ensure that\n    ICS providers are not deprived of fair compensation\n    for the use of their payphones; § 201 authorizes it to\n    ensure that rates for and in connection with interstate\n    telecommunications services are just and reasonable.\n    The FCC may not ignore these statutory limits to\n    advance its preferred correctional policy.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 4.\n\f                               28\n    We therefore reverse and vacate the provision in the Order\nthat purports to cap intrastate rates as beyond the statutory\nauthority of the Commission. We need not decide the precise\nparameters of the Commission’s authority under § 276. We\nsimply hold here that the agency’s attempted exercise of\nauthority in the disputed Order cannot stand.\n\nD. The Categorical Exclusion of Site Commission Costs\n\n   The Petitioners contend that:\n\n      The FCC’s exclusion of site commission payments\n   from the costs used to set ICS rate caps was unlawful.\n   ICS providers are required by state and local\n   governments and correctional institutions to pay site\n   commissions; those commissions are accordingly a\n   cost of providing service like other state taxes and fees\n   that the FCC recognizes as recoverable costs. The FCC\n   acknowledged that, taking site commissions into\n   consideration, the rate caps were below providers’\n   costs. This violates the FCC’s obligation to “ensure\n   that all payphone service providers are fairly\n   compensated,” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A), § 201’s “just\n   and reasonable” requirement, and the Constitution’s\n   Takings Clause.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16. The concerns raised by Petitioners\nare compelling.\n\n    The Commission’s categorical exclusion of site\ncommissions from the calculus used to set ICS rate caps defies\nreasoned decisionmaking because site commissions obviously\nare costs of doing business incurred by ICS providers. Yet, the\nOrder categorically excluded site commissions and then “set\nthe rate caps below cost.” Id. at 20. This is hard to fathom. “An\n\f                               29\nagency acts arbitrarily or capriciously if it has . . . offered an\nexplanation either contrary to the evidence before the agency\nor so implausible as not to reflect either a difference in view or\nagency expertise.” Defs. of Wildlife & Ctr. for Biological\nDiversity v.

Cir. 2016) (citing State\nFarm, 463 U.S. at 43). Ignoring costs that the Commission\nacknowledges to be legitimate is implausible.\n\n    The FCC’s suggestion that site commissions “have nothing\nto do with the provision of ICS,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12822\n(internal quotation marks omitted), makes no sense in light of\nthe undisputed record in this case. In some instances,\ncommissions are mandated by state statute, Rates for Interstate\nInmate Calling Services, 27 FCC Rcd. 16629, 16643 (2012),\nand in other instances commissions are required by state\ncorrectional institutions as a condition of doing business with\nICS providers, 17 FCC Rcd. at 3252–53. “If agreeing to pay\nsite commissions is a condition precedent to ICS providers\noffering their services, those commissions are ‘related to the\nprovision of ICS.’” Joint Br. for Pet’rs at 21. And it does not\nmatter that the states may use the commissions for purposes\nunrelated to the activities of correctional facilities. The ICS\nproviders who are required to pay the site commissions as a\ncondition of doing business have no control over the funds once\nthey are paid. None of the other reasons offered by the\nCommission to justify the categorical exclusion of site\ncommissions passes muster.\n\n    On the record before us, we simply cannot comprehend the\nagency’s reasoning. Where, as here, an agency’s “explanation\nfor its determination . . . lacks any coherence,” we owe “no\ndeference to [the agency’s] purported expertise.” Tripoli\nRocketry Ass’n v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and\nExplosives, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186616\"><a href=\"/opinion/186616/tripoli-rocketry-v-bur-atf/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (D.C.

Not only does the\n\f                              30\nFCC’s reasoning defy comprehension, the categorical\nexclusion of site commissions cannot be easily squared with\nthe requirements of § 276 and § 201. We therefore vacate this\nportion of the Order.\n\n    In its 2016 Reconsideration Order, the Commission raised\nthe rate caps specifically to account for a portion of site\ncommissions, effectively acknowledging that a categorical\nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus is\nimplausible. The Commission said:\n\n   [W]e have decided, out of an abundance of caution, to\n   take a more conservative approach and expressly\n   account for facilities’ ICS-related costs when\n   calculating our rate caps. Accordingly, we grant the\n   Hamden Petition in part . . . and increase our interstate\n   and intrastate rate caps to expressly account for\n   reasonable facility costs related to ICS.\n\nReconsideration Order, 31 FCC Rcd. at 9302. Although the\nFCC purported to change its position in the Reconsideration\nOrder, that order does not moot Petitioner’s challenge here.\nSee, e.g., N.E. Fla. Contractors v. Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">663</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n662 (1993) (replacing the challenged law “with one that differs\nonly in some insignificant respect” and “disadvantages\n[petitioners] in the same fundamental way” does not moot the\nunderlying challenge).\n\n     The Reconsideration Order is not before us, so we cannot\nsay whether it provides a satisfactory response to Petitioners’\nchallenge. We will leave this for the Commission’s\nconsideration on remand. We also leave it to the Commission\nto assess on remand which portions of site commissions might\nbe directly related to the provision of ICS and therefore\nlegitimate, and which are not. In addition, although we\n\f                               31\nconclude that the Order at issue here is arbitrary and capricious\ninsofar as it categorically excludes site commissions from the\nratemaking calculus, we do not reach Petitioners’ remaining\narguments that the exclusion of site commissions denies ICS\nproviders fair compensation under § 276 and violates the\nTakings Clause of the Constitution because it forces providers\nto provide services below cost. These matters should be\naddressed by the Commission on remand once it revisits the\nexclusion of site commissions from the ratemaking calculus.\n\nE. The Legality of the FCC’s Use of Industry-Wide\n   Averages in Setting Rate Caps\n\n   Petitioners contend that:\n\n      Even if site commissions are disregarded, the rate\n   caps were set too low to ensure compensation “for each\n   and every completed . . . call.” [47 U.S.C. §\n   276(b)(1)(A)]. The FCC’s caps are below average\n   costs documented by numerous ICS providers and\n   would deny cost recovery for a substantial percentage\n   of all inmate calls. The FCC’s assertion that ICS\n   providers with costs above the caps operate\n   inefficiently is contrary to the record. The FCC relied\n   on two outlier ICS providers that — combined —\n   represent 0.1 percent of the ICS market. And it ignored\n   evidence showing that the cost to provide ICS varies\n   widely on the basis of regional differences, such as the\n   age and condition of a given facility or the specific\n   security features that correctional authorities demand.\n\n   ****\n\n   The record includes two economic analyses, both\n   concluding that the Order’s rate caps are below cost\n\f                                32\n    for a substantial number of ICS calls even after\n    excluding site commissions. . . .\n\n    The Order does not challenge these studies or their\n    conclusions. On the contrary, it acknowledges that\n    seven of 14 ICS providers that submitted cost data\n    reported per-minute costs of “$0.25 or higher,” above\n    the highest prepaid rate cap of $0.22 per minute.\n\nJoint Br. for Pet’rs at 16–17, 30–31 (quoting Order, 30 FCC\nRcd. at 12669–70, 12795). Petitioners’ claims are well taken\nand largely undisputed. And, as noted above, the FCC has\nabandoned its contention that the agency lawfully considered\nindustry-wide averages in setting the rate caps, and for good\nreasons.\n\n     First, to the extent that the Order purports to set caps for\nintrastate rates, it is infirm for the reasons stated above. Second,\nthe averaging calculus is patently unreasonable. The FCC\ncalculated its rate caps “using a weighted average per minute\ncost,” Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790, allowing providers to\n“recover average costs at each and every tier,” id. n.170. This\nmakes calls with above-average costs in each tier unprofitable,\nhowever, and thus does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that\n“each and every” inter- and intrastate call be fairly\ncompensated. See Am. Pub. Commc’ns Council v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769026\"><a href=\"/opinion/769026/american-public-communications-councilpetitioners-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54, 57–58 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n     Moreover, the Order advances an efficiency argument –\nthat the larger providers can become profitable under the rate\ncaps if they operate more efficiently – based on data from the\ntwo smallest firms. See Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12790–95. Not\nonly do those firms represent less than one percent of the\nindustry, but the record shows that regional variation, not\nefficiency, accounts for cost discrepancies among providers.\n\f                               33\nSee id. at 12965 n.61 (dissenting statement of Commissioner\nPai). The Order does not account for these conflicting record\ndata.\n\n     In sum, the Order’s analysis of the record data in setting\nrate caps was not the product of reasoned decisionmaking. We\nwill therefore vacate that portion of the Order and remand for\nfurther proceedings.\n\nF.   The Imposition of Ancillary Fee Caps\n\n     Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, the Order’s\nimposition of ancillary fee caps in connection with interstate\ncalls is justified. The Commission has plenary authority to\nregulate interstate rates under § 201(b), including “practices\n. . . for and in connection with” interstate calls. The Order\nexplains that ICS providers use ancillary fees as a loophole in\navoiding per-minute rate caps. Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12842.\nFurthermore, ancillary fees for interstate calls satisfy the test\nof the Commission’s authority under § 201(b) as they are “in\nconnection with” interstate calls. However, these\nconsiderations do not fully answer the question whether the\ndisputed imposition of ancillary fee caps is permissible.\n\n    As noted above, we have found that, on the record in this\ncase, the Order’s imposition of intrastate rate caps fails review\nunder § 276. Therefore, we likewise hold that the FCC had no\nauthority to impose ancillary fee caps with respect to intrastate\ncalls. However, we cannot discern from the record whether\nancillary fees can be segregated between interstate and\nintrastate calls. We are therefore obliged to remand the matter\nto the FCC for further consideration.\n\f                               34\nG. The Imposition of Reporting Requirements\n\n     The Commission initially contended that the Order’s\nrequirements with respect to reporting requirements for video\nvisitation services and site commissions were unripe for review\nbecause they were pending budgetary approval by the Office\nof Management and Budget (“OMB”). After briefing, however,\nOMB approval was published. See 82 Fed. Reg. 12182-01\n(Mar. 1, 2017). Accordingly, the Commission withdrew its\nripeness challenge. Letter, Global Tel*Link (D.C. Cir. Mar. 1,\n2017), ECF No. 1663705. Therefore, the parties agree that we\nmay review the Commission’s imposition of the disputed\nreporting requirements.\n\n     We hold that the video visitation services reporting\nrequirement, 47 C.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(4), is too attenuated to the\nCommission’s statutory authority to justify this requirement.\nThe Commission asserts that whether or not video visitation\nservices are a form of ICS, they are still subject to the agency’s\njurisdiction. See, e.g., Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at 12891–92; Br. for\nFCC at 56–57. We disagree. Before it may assert its jurisdiction\nto impose such a reporting requirement, the Commission must\nfirst explain how its statutory authority extends to video\nvisitation services as a “communication[] by wire or radio”\nunder § 201(b) for interstate calls or as an “inmate telephone\nservice” under § 276(d) for interstate or intrastate calls. The\nOrder under review offers no such explanations. We therefore\nvacate the reporting requirement for video visitation services.\n\n     In contrast, we find no merit in Petitioners’ challenge to\nthe site commission payment reporting requirement under 47\nC.F.R. § 64.6060(a)(3). The quibble between the parties is\nlargely over semantics. The Commission agrees that the\ndefinition of site commission payment should be read largely\nas Petitioners argue: namely, site commissions are “incentive\n\f                               35\npayments designed to influence a correctional authority’s\nselection of its monopoly service provider, not a form of\nordinary tax.” Br. for FCC at 59 (citing Order, 30 FCC Rcd. at\n12818–22). So defined, the reporting requirement is lawful on\nits face and Petitioners do not disagree. We therefore deny the\npetition for review.\n\nH. The Preemption and Due Process Claims\n\n     Petitioner Pay Tel separately challenges the Commission’s\nrefusal to preempt certain state ICS rate caps that are lower than\nthose the Commission set in the Order. Because we are\nvacating the portion of the Order imposing intrastate rate caps\nunder § 276(b), the preemption provision under § 276(c) is no\nlonger at issue. There are no relevant regulations under § 276\nremaining in the Order with respect to which the lower state\nrate caps might be preempted. This issue is therefore moot.\n\n     Pay Tel’s claim that its due process rights were infringed\nwhen it was not given timely access to key cost data that the\nFCC relied on in setting the rate caps is also moot. We are\nvacating the portion of the Order setting rate caps for intrastate\nrates; the Commission has acknowledged that its use of\nindustry-average data to set rates was error; and Pay Tel\nobtained access to the disputed data prior to the Commission’s\nissuance of the Reconsideration Order setting rate caps that\nsupersede those in the Order at issue. The concerns raised by\nPay Tel are thus moot.\n\n                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n    In accordance with the foregoing opinion, we grant in part\nand deny in part the petitions for review, vacate certain\nprovisions in the disputed Order, and remand for further\n\f                            36\nproceedings with respect to certain matters. We also dismiss\ntwo claims as moot.\n\n                                               So ordered.\n\f      SILBERMAN, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: I concur\nwith Judge Edwards’ opinion in all respects. I especially agree\nthat Chevron deference would be inappropriate in these unusual\ncircumstances. I write separately to point out, as to the FCC’s\nclaimed jurisdiction to set intrastate rate caps, that I think our\nresult would be the same if the Chevron framework was in play,\ni.e., if the FCC had elected to defend this part of its regulation.\n\n     There is no question that the relevant statutory language,\n“fairly compensated,” is ambiguous. 47 U.S.C. 276(b)(1)(A).\nEven the FCC agrees. But Judge Edwards’ careful explanation\nof the statute’s structure and context demonstrates that the\nagency’s interpretation would fail at Chevron’s second step; it\nis an unreasonable (impermissible) interpretation of section 276.\n\n     Much of the recent expressed concern about Chevron\nignores that Chevron’s second step can and should be a\nmeaningful limitation on the ability of administrative agencies\nto exploit statutory ambiguities, assert farfetched interpretations,\nand usurp undelegated policymaking discretion.1 This case\npresents just one example of those kinds of agency tactics.\nThere are others.

But he never conceded\nthat the word “modify” was ambiguous, which it was. Id. at 228\n(“We have not the slightest doubt that [single definition] is the\nmeaning the statute intended.”).\n\n     Subsequently, however, in AT&T Corp. v.

See, e.g., Goldstein v.

This is just such a case where the agency’s original\nclaim for Chevron deference—before the agency’s control\nswitched—would have been rejected at Chevron step two; a\nmuscular use of that analysis is a barrier to inappropriate\nadministrative adventure.\n\f    PILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting as to Sections II.B\nthrough II.F and concurring in part:\n     The administrative record is full of compelling evidence\nof dysfunction in the inmate-calling marketplace, with harsh\nconsequences for inmates and their families. The rule under\nreview began with a 2000 lawsuit filed by inmates, family\nmembers, loved ones, and counsel (referred to in these\nproceedings as the Wright Petitioners). Finally acting on the\nWright Petitioners’ concerns, the FCC in 2015 modestly\ncurtailed exorbitant per-minute calling rates and limited\nproviders’ ability to extract confusing and unrelated ancillary\nfees—amounting to as much as 38 percent of total inmate-\ncalling revenue—for such things as setting up an account,\nfunding an account, issuing a refund, and closing an account.\nSee 30 FCC Rcd. 12763, 12838-42 (2015). The record shows\nthat these high prices impair the ability of inmates, by\ndefinition isolated physically from the outside world, to sustain\nfragile filaments of connection to families and communities\nthat they might hope to rejoin. The majority’s decision scuttles\na long-term effort to rein in calling costs that are not\nmeaningfully subject to competition and that profit off of\ninmates’ desperation for connection.\n     The majority’s path to that result is flawed. I cannot agree\nthat a company is “fairly compensated” under 47 U.S.C.\n§ 276(b)(1)(A) when it charges inmates exorbitant prices to use\npayphones inside prisons and jails, shielded from competition\nby a contract granting it a facility-wide payphone monopoly.\nThe majority does not question that Congress enacted the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 to combat phone\nmonopolies, facilitate competition, and thereby ensure better\nservice at lower prices to consumers. Consistent with the 1996\nAct’s general approach of “replac[ing] a state-regulated\nmonopoly system with a federally facilitated, competitive\nmarket,” section 276 of the Act specifically addressed defects\nin the intrastate and interstate payphone market (now largely\nobsolete except in cellphone-free environments such as\n\f                                2\nprisons).

Cir. 2003).\n     The majority holds it beyond debate that “fairly\ncompensated” is not about fairness to the consumer. It sees no\nstatutory support for the FCC’s effort to require fairer intrastate\nrates for inmates because it reads section 276’s fair-\ncompensation mandate as unambiguously one-sided, only\nempowering the FCC to enhance unfairly low, not to reduce\nunfairly high, compensation for calls. It accepts Global\nTel*Link’s characterization of section 276 as nothing but a “no\nfree calls” provision, Oral Arg. Tr. 40:55, confined to the\nenacting Congress’s acknowledged concern about independent\npayphone providers going uncompensated for certain calls.\nBut that reading is truncated. As it typically does, Congress\nresponded to a particular problem by enacting a law that speaks\nin more general terms: here, by requiring that payphone calls\nin prisons and elsewhere be “fairly compensated.” It did so for\nthe stated purpose—fully relevant here—of promoting\ncompetition among payphone providers to expand the\navailability of payphone services to consumers. 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1).\n     The majority offers one plausible reading of section 276,\nbut it is assuredly not the only one. Congress has not “directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue” in this case, so the\nquestion for us is whether the FCC’s view when it promulgated\nthe challenged rule—that section 276 grants authority not only\nto raise inadequate rates but also to reduce excessive,\nmonopoly-driven rates—was a “permissible construction of\nthe statute.” Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

I think it was. If the FCC\nunder new management wishes by notice and comment to\nchange its rule, the statute gives it latitude to do so. We should\nuphold the rule that is on the books and leave to the agency to\ndecide whether and how to change it.\n\f                                 3\n                                 I.\n     The FCC reasonably interpreted section 276 to “authorize\nthe Commission to impose intrastate rate caps as prescribed in\nthe Order.” Op. at 20-21. Congress instructed the FCC to\n“establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all\npayphone service providers are fairly compensated for each\nand every completed intrastate and interstate call using their\npayphone[s].” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A). To begin with,\nnobody contests that authority to establish “a per call\ncompensation plan” includes some authority over end-user\ncalling rates. Indeed, this court already so held. See Illinois\nPublic Telecommunications Ass’n v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743057\"><a href=\"/opinion/743057/illinois-public-telecommunications-association-v-federal-communications/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562\n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (“Because … there is no indication that the\nCongress intended to exclude local coin rates from the term\n‘compensation’ in § 276, we hold that the statute\nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate\nthe rates for local coin calls.”). And the plain text of the statute\ngrants that authority over both intrastate and interstate\npayphone services, including “inmate telephone service in\ncorrectional institutions.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(d). Thus, the only\ndispute is whether the word “fairly” implies an ability to reduce\nexcesses, as well as bolster deficiencies, in the compensation\nthat payphone providers would otherwise receive.\n     Importantly, Congress chose “fairly” rather than, say,\n“adequately,” “sufficiently,” or “amply.” Those words have\ndifferent meanings. Had it used any of the latter three terms, I\nwould agree that Congress only authorized regulation to\nprevent under-compensation, but its choice of the word “fairly”\ndenotes no such limitation. Compare WEBSTER’S NEW\nCOLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 407 (1980) (defining “fair” as, inter\nalia, “marked by impartiality and honesty: free from self-\ninterest, prejudice, or favoritism”), with id. at 14 (defining\n“adequate” as, inter alia, “sufficient for a specific\nrequirement”), and id. at 1156 (defining “sufficient” as, inter\n\f                               4\nalia, “enough to meet the needs of a situation or a proposed\nend”). Those words are also used differently in everyday\nlanguage. See Schindler Elevator Corp. v. U.S. ex rel.

If a grocer demanded $20\nfor a banana, we might call that price adequate, sufficient, or\nample—but nobody would call it fair.\n      The statutory context shows that Congress’ choice of the\nword “fairly” reasonably connotes its concern for unfairly\nexcessive as well as deficient compensation. Elsewhere in the\nCommunications Act, Congress used the term “fair” in\nconjunction with “just” and “reasonable”—familiar terms of\nart used in connection with rate-setting authority. See 47\nU.S.C. § 204(b) (providing for partial authorization of new\ncharges, which would otherwise be stayed, if the FCC\ndetermines “that such partial authorization is just, fair, and\nreasonable”); id. § 205(a) (authorizing the FCC to prescribe\n“what classification, regulation, or practice is or will be just,\nfair, and reasonable”). And the fact that section 276 is one of\nseveral “Special Provisions Concerning Bell Operating\nCompanies,” see Op. at 9, does not suggest that Congress\nexclusively intended to regulate the relationship between\nBOCs and non-BOCs to boost the latter’s compensation and\nwas wholly unconcerned about the risk that callers would be\ncharged excessive rates.\n     The purpose and history behind the congressional action\nhere comport with this reading of the statutory text and context.\nIn passing the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Congress aimed\nto “promot[e] competition in the payphone service industry.”\nNew England, 334 F.3d at 71; see also 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)\n(stating congressional purpose “to promote competition among\npayphone service providers and promote the widespread\ndeployment of payphone services to the benefit of the general\npublic”).    To be sure, the immediate anti-competitive\n\f                               5\nmalfunction confronting Congress at the time was that certain\npayphone providers were, under certain circumstances, under-\ncompensated. See Illinois Pub. Telecomms. Ass’n v.

Cir. 2014). But the central aim was to\nadvance competition to the benefit of the end users of payphone\nservices. Senator Kerry, for instance, explained that his goal in\nintroducing section 276 was “to establish a level playing field\nfor independent payphone providers,” and thereby to enable\ncompetition “on the basis of price, quality and service, rather\nthan on marketshare and subsidies.” 3 Reams & Manz, Federal\nTelecommunications Law: A Legislative History of the\nTelecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110\nStat. 56 (1996), at S710.\n     Consistent with that pro-competitive agenda, the FCC and\nthis court have long assumed that section 276 provides tools for\naddressing monopoly power and market failure in the\npayphone market. For instance, in Illinois, the state petitioners\nargued that the FCC had unlawfully ignored the problem of\n“locational monopolies,” that is, situations in which a\npayphone provider “obtains an exclusive contract for the\nprovision of all payphones at an isolated location, such as an\nairport, stadium, or mall, and is thereby able to charge an\ninflated rate for local calls made from that location.” 117 F.3d\nat 562. We recognized that the FCC had not ignored the\nproblem of locational monopolies; it had simply “concluded\nthat it would deal with them if and when specific [providers]\nare shown to have substantial market power.” Id. Now, twenty\nyears later, the FCC has identified a discrete area where\npayphone providers do have substantial market power: prisons\nand jails. The inmate-calling market is, the FCC found, “a\nprime example of market failure” because, instead of\ncompeting to reduce rates and improve services for callers,\nproviders compete to offer ever-higher site commissions to\ncorrectional facilities so as to gain monopoly access to a\nliterally captive consumer base. 30 FCC Rcd. at 12765 & n.9.\n\f                                 6\n     Nevertheless, the majority cites four considerations that\ninfluenced its rejection of the FCC’s claimed authority over\nintrastate inmate calling services. Op. at 21-24. None is\ncompelling.\n     First, the majority notes that section 152(b) “erects a\npresumption against the Commission’s assertion of regulatory\nauthority over intrastate communications.” Op. at 21 (citing\nLouisiana Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111672\"><a href=\"/opinion/111672/louisiana-pub-serv-commn-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 373\n(1986)). That is true, but section 276, by its plain terms,\n“overcom[es] this presumption.” Op. at 21. Congress\ninstructed the FCC to ensure fair compensation for all\npayphone calls—interstate and intrastate. 47 U.S.C. §\n276(b)(1)(A). To that end, Congress expressly provided for\npreemption of inconsistent state regulation. Id. § 276(c). This\ncase is thus unlike Louisiana, which held that federal power\nover depreciation charges pursuant to section 220 was limited\nto the interstate ratemaking context; it is simply not “possible”\nhere that section 276 “do[es] no more than spell out the\nauthority of the FCC . . . in the context of interstate regulation.”\nLouisiana, 476 U.S. at 377. Whatever section 276 means, it\napplies in both the interstate and intrastate contexts. Cf. N.Y.\n& Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775104\"><a href=\"/opinion/775104/people-of-the-state-of-new-york-public-service-commission-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102-03 (2d\nCir. 2001) (concluding that section 251(e) clearly “grants the\nFCC authority to act with respect to those areas of intrastate\nservice encompassed by the terms ‘North American\nNumbering Plan’ and ‘numbering administration,’” and\napplying Chevron deference to agency’s interpretation of\n“what either term encompasses”).\n     Second, the majority says that “the Order erroneously\ntreats the Commission’s authority under § 201 and § 276 as\ncoterminous.” Op. at 21. My colleagues appear to draw that\nconclusion from the FCC’s repeated use of the phrase “just,\nreasonable, and fair”—an amalgam of the two provisions’ key\nterms. As I read the Order, the bundling of those three words\n\f                               7\nsimply reflects that the FCC’s authority over inmate calling\nderives from the sum of those authorizations. The majority’s\ninference that the Order fails to respect the difference between\nsections 201 and 276, and in particular, fails to appreciate that\nsection 201 applies only to interstate rates, has no support in\nthe record.\n     Third, the majority concludes that the FCC erred in finding\nsupport for its approach in prior agency orders. Op. at 22-23.\nThe majority says that “the prior orders . . . focused on\npayphone providers and carriers to determine whether the\nproviders were fairly compensated.” Op. at 23. But this court\nhas held that “compensation” includes end-user rates; it is not\nlimited to payments between payphone providers and carriers.\nIllinois, 117 F.3d at 562 (“[W]e hold that the statute\nunambiguously grants the Commission authority to regulate\nthe rates for local coin calls.”).\n     Fourth, the majority says the FCC mistakenly relied on this\ncourt’s decisions in Illinois and New England. Op. at 24-26.\nThe majority acknowledges that Illinois “held that § 276\nunambiguously overrode § 152(b)’s presumption against\nintrastate jurisdiction insofar as it granted the Commission\nauthority to ‘set’ reimbursement rates for local coin calls in\norder to ensure that payphone operators who were previously\nuncompensated were ‘fairly compensated.’” Op. at 24.\nAccording to the majority, however, setting rates to increase\nproviders’ compensation is different from reducing “already\ncompensatory rates.” Op. at 25. Yet Illinois ratified the FCC’s\nassertion of authority to regulate “locational monopolies.” 117\nF.3d at 562. The majority responds that the FCC never said it\nwould consider intrastate rate caps as the means of breaking up\nsuch monopolies. See Op. at 25. But the FCC, as we noted in\nIllinois, “specifically reserved the right to modify its\nderegulation scheme, for example, by limiting the number of\ncompensable calls from each payphone.” 117 F.3d at 563.\n\f                                8\nLimiting the number of compensable calls per phone is, of\ncourse, economically similar to limiting the rate per call; either\nincentivizes broader deployment of payphones to maintain the\nsame revenue levels. Thus, the FCC contemplated, and the\nCourt approved, just the sort of pro-consumer regulation the\nFCC eventually undertook in the Order under review.\n     Petitioners argue that in the rule at issue in Illinois, the\nFCC had merely claimed the authority “to adjust the per-call\ncompensation scheme that the FCC itself put in place to ensure\nfair compensation,” not the “authority to regulate existing\nmarket rates.” ICS Pet’rs Br. 46 n.31. That is a false\ndichotomy. Cf. Illinois, 117 F.3d at 563 (“A market-based\napproach is as much a compensation scheme as a rate-setting\napproach.”). The bottom line is that the FCC anticipated the\nproblem of monopoly power in the provision of payphone\nservices, and this Court ratified the agency’s authority to\ncombat that problem by reducing providers’ compensation,\nincluding by adjusting end-user rates. There is thus no basis\nfor the majority’s contention that “the FCC consistently\nconstrued its authority over intrastate payphone rates as limited\nto addressing the problem of under-compensation for ICS\nproviders.” Op. at 5.\n     The majority also takes issue with the Order’s invocation\nof New England, but the FCC correctly relied on that precedent\nfor the limited point that “section 276 unambiguously and\nstraightforwardly authorizes the Commission to regulate [the\nBell Operating Companies’] intrastate payphone line rates.” 30\nFCC Rcd. at 12815 (quoting 334 F.3d at 75). The fact that the\nFCC and this court previously articulated section 276 authority\nin terms of generic rate regulation is relevant here. And,\ncontrary to the majority, New England’s holding that section\n276(b)(1)(C) does not apply to non-Bell Operating Companies\nhas no resonance in this case. The provision at issue here,\nsection 276(b)(1)(A), is indisputably applicable to non-BOCs:\n\f                                9\nit requires that “all payphone service providers [be] fairly\ncompensated.” 47 U.S.C. § 276(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).\n     None of this is to suggest that the FCC has the same “broad\nplenary authority to regulate and cap intrastate rates” that it has\nover interstate rates. Op. at 26. Notably, whereas section 201\nbroadly requires that “[a]ll charges, practices, classifications,\nand regulations for and in connection with [interstate]\ncommunication service[] shall be just and reasonable,” section\n276 is more narrowly focused on “compensation.” The FCC\nsimply did not need “broad plenary authority” to conclude that\ninmate calling service providers charging as much as $56.00\nfor a four-minute call, see Op. at 11, were not being “fairly\ncompensated.”\n                                II.\n     The majority also holds that the FCC’s complete exclusion\nof site commissions from its cost calculus and its use of\nindustry-wide averages were arbitrary and capricious. See Op.\nat 28-33. It is unclear why the majority finds it necessary to\naddress how the caps were calculated, given its rejection of the\nFCC’s power to cap at all. In any event, the majority’s analysis\nis misguided.\n     Regarding site commissions, the majority says that\n“[i]gnoring costs that the Commission acknowledges to be\nlegitimate is implausible.” Op. at 29. But the FCC did not\nacknowledge site commissions as legitimate costs. Quite to the\ncontrary, the FCC agreed with a commenter who described site\ncommissions as “legal bribes to induce correctional agencies to\nprovide ICS providers with lucrative monopoly contracts.” 30\nFCC Rcd. at 12821. In other words, the FCC viewed site\ncommissions not as real costs of doing business, but as “an\napportionment of profit” between providers and correctional\nfacilities. Id. at 12822. The majority suggests that if site\ncommissions are “directly related to the provision” of inmate\n\f                              10\ncalling services in that they are conditions of receiving\ncontracts to provide such services, they are “therefore\nlegitimate.” Op. at 30. That equation makes no sense; the fact\nthat a cost was charged under a prior regulatory regime cannot\nmean the agency is required to recognize that cost as\n“legitimate” and is disempowered from regulating it.\n     Simply put, the fact that a state may demand them does not\nmake site commissions a legitimate cost of providing calling\nservices. The majority asserts that “[i]n some instances,\ncommissions are mandated by state statute,” Op. at 29, but the\nrecord reflects that there is only one such statute, Tex. Gov’t\nCode Ann. § 495.027(a)(2). That statute categorically\ndemands site commissions of at least 40 per cent of the\nprovider’s gross revenue, which only illustrates the problem\nthat site commissions are a form of monopoly rent not tied to\nactual costs.\n     Indeed, considering site commissions as a compensable\ncost would effectively negate the FCC’s authority to mitigate\nlocational monopolies. Imagine that a payphone provider (in\nthe pre-cell phone era) contracted with a large stadium to\nprovide just three payphones, anticipating that its monopoly\nwould enable it to charge several dollars per minute while\nkicking back some percentage to the stadium. Plainly, the\nstatutory goals of “competition” and “widespread deployment\nof payphone services” could be well served by a rule imposing\nreasonable, market-sensitive price caps to spur providers to\noffer more phones to maintain the same levels of revenue. 47\nU.S.C. § 276(b)(1). But any such price cap would be worthless\nif it had to be calculated to ensure that the provider could\ncontinue its kickbacks to the stadium.            The kickback\narrangement might, in some sense, be “related” to the provision\nof payphone services at the stadium, but it is not “reasonably”\nrelated because acceding to such preexisting contractual\nrelationships is inconsistent with the statutory scheme.\n\f                                11\n    On the averaging issue, the majority concludes that\nbecause the Order “makes calls with above-average costs . . .\nunprofitable,” it “does not fulfill the mandate of § 276 that\n‘each and every’ inter- and intrastate call be fairly\ncompensated.” Op. at 32. This holding seems to follow from\nthe majority’s pinched interpretation of section 276 as a one-\nway ratchet whereby providers are always entitled to recoup\n“actual” costs incurred under monopoly conditions, no matter\nhow extravagant. As I have explained, I believe that section\n276 conveys some authority to lower rates, which means the\nFCC need not take as given “calls with above-average costs.”\n      Additionally, the majority fails to reckon with the FCC’s\nindependent authority to cap rates for interstate calls under\nsection 201, despite acknowledging that this power is “broad”\nand “plenary.” Op. at 26. In my view, the FCC has wide\ndiscretion under its section 201 “just and reasonable” interstate\nratemaking authority to decide which costs to take into account\nand to use industry-wide averages that do not necessarily\ncompensate “each and every” call, as section 276 requires.

Cir. 2007) (agency is not “weaponless\nagainst conduct that might encourage or cloak the running up\nof unreasonable costs”). As the state petitioners aptly\nsummarized, section 201 “gave the Commission broad\nregulatory authority over interstate communication in a\n‘traditional form,’ mirroring regulation of railroads and public\nutilities, enabling it to set rates to allow a monopolistic utility\nto recover a reasonable profit but also protect the consumer\nfrom unjustly high prices.” State Pet’rs Br. at 28-29. The\nmajority never explains why the FCC’s rate-setting\nmethodology would be impermissible as to the interstate caps.\n                               III.\n     Finally, I note that the majority offers no persuasive reason\nfor abandoning the Chevron framework (which it admittedly\n\f                                12\ndoes only in dicta, as Chevron deference plays no role in an\nopinion holding section 276 unambiguous). It acknowledges\nthat the Order is “presumptively subject” to deferential review,\nbut then concludes that “it would make no sense for this court\nto determine whether the disputed agency positions advanced\nin the Order warrant Chevron deference when the agency has\nabandoned those positions.” Op. at 18. Absent any briefing on\nthe subject or any citation to precedent, I cannot agree.\n     The FCC, through notice-and-comment rulemaking, took\ncertain positions—most notably that section 276 authorizes\nregulation of the fairness of intrastate inmate-calling rates—\nand defended them vigorously in briefing before this court.\nLess than a month before argument, the court on its own motion\ndirected the parties to explain whether this case should be held\nin abeyance in light of recent personnel changes at the FCC.\nThe FCC responded that the court should “move forward on\nthe current schedule.” Doc. No. 1656116 (Jan. 17, 2017). Two\nweeks later, and just a week before argument, the FCC\ninformed us that it would no longer defend certain points that\nit had briefed, but that the Wright Petitioners would “defend all\naspects of the Order.” Doc. No. 1658521 (Jan. 31, 2017). The\nFCC has not committed to formally reviewing the Order, as\nother similarly situated agencies have recently done. See, e.g.,\nMurray Energy Corp. v. EPA, No. 15-1385, Doc. No. 1670218\n(April 7, 2017) (requesting postponement of oral argument so\nthat agency could “fully review” the relevant rule). By\nsuggesting that agencies can relinquish judicial deference\nthrough such limited and belated maneuvers as refusing to\ndefend portions of their briefs during oral argument, the\nmajority risks enabling agencies to end-run the principle that\nthey must “use the same procedures when they amend or repeal\na rule as they used to issue the rule in the first instance.” Perez\nv.
