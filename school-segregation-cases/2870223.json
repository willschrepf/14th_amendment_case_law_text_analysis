The United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey granted the Township’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on all claims, though its written decision focused primarily on the Koorns’\n\nsubstantive due process claim. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n                                             Facts\n\n          Shain Koorn (who is African-American) and Rafaela Koorn (who is Hispanic)\n\npurchased a home and property in the Township of Lacey, New Jersey, in 1998. After\n\nmoving in with many dogs (according to the Koorns, “less than 20”), they were soon\n\ninformed by the local code enforcement officer of a Township ordinance limiting\n\nproperty owners to six dogs. Later, both the Koorns and the Township discovered that\n\nwhat the code enforcement officer had believed was an official ordinance was in fact an\n\ninformal policy. In response to complaints from the Koorns’ neighbors, in November\n\n\n\n   1\n       For convenience, the defendants will be collectively referred to as “the Township.”\n\n                                               2\n\f2000 the Lacey Township Board of Health formally enacted an Animal Control\n\nOrdinance (“Ordinance”) limiting the number of dogs that may be kept “in or about a\n\ndwelling” to six.2\n\n       It is not necessary to describe in detail the ongoing dispute between the Koorns,\n\ntheir neighbors, and Township officials. It suffices that some of the Koorns’ neighbors\n\nbegan complaining to Township officials about the Koorns’ dogs and about certain lights\n\ninstalled by the Koorns as a security measure. The Koorns allege that the enforcement\n\nactions brought under local dog-barking and lighting ordinances were harassing to them.\n\nAs for the enactment of the Ordinance, the relevant additional facts are the alleged racist\n\nstatements the Koorns attribute to certain Township officials who were instrumental in\n\nthe Ordinance’s enactment. One member of the Township Committee—indeed its liaison\n\nto the Board of Health, Ronald Sterling—was an admitted “motivating factor” in the\n\nenactment of the Ordinance. The Koorns allege that Sterling made a racist\n\nremark—consisting of a lynching reference—at a televised Township Committee\n\nmeeting. The Koorns also allege that then-Mayor Parker, in conversation with the code\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    The Ordinance states in relevant part: “No person shall maintain, keep, or harbor ... or\npermit to be maintained, kept or harbored in or about any dwelling or dwelling unit under\nhis control a total of more than six (6) dogs over seven (7) months of age or which\npossess a set of permanent teeth.” The Ordinance was passed pursuant to the Board of\nHealth’s authority under N.J.S.A. 26:3-31 to “pass, alter, or amend ordinances and make\nrules and regulations in regard to the public health within its jurisdiction, for the\nfollowing purposes...K. to regulate, control or prohibit the keeping and slaughtering of\nanimals.”\n\n                                             3\n\fenforcement officer, made a racist reference to the Koorns.\n\n         In January 2001, the Koorns filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that the\n\nenactment of the Ordinance violated the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment\n\n(substantive and procedural due process), the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I, Section\n\nof the Constitution, the Fair Housing Act and other civil rights statutes, and various state\n\nlaws. They simultaneously sought to enjoin the Township from enforcing the Ordinance\n\nagainst them. After the District Court denied their motion for injunction, the Koorns\n\nnegotiated with the Township for a stay of enforcement. They then amended their\n\nDistrict Court complaint to replace the request for injunctive relief with a request for\n\ndamages. In August 2002, the Township moved for summary judgment, which the\n\nDistrict Court granted. Koorn v. Lacey Township, No. 01-79 (D.N.J. Dec. 23, 2002).\n\nThe Koorns appeal.3\n\n                                              II.\n                                          Discussion\n\nA.       Substantive Due Process Claims\n\n         The Koorns argue that the adoption and enforcement of the Ordinance violates\n\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. The Fourteenth Amendment\n\nprovides that no State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\n\n\n\n\n     3\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of a summary\njudgment order is de novo, applying the same standard as the District Court. Ideal Dairy\nFarms, Inc. v. John Labatt, Ltd., 90 F.3d 737, 743 (3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                                               4\n\fprocess of law.” It is well known that while, “on its face, this constitutional provision\n\nspeaks to the adequacy of state procedures, . . . the clause also has a substantive\n\ncomponent.” Nicholas v. Pa. State Univ., 227 F.3d 133, 139 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing\n\nPlanned Parenthood of S.E. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846-47 (1992)). This substantive\n\ncomponent protects citizens from arbitrary and improperly-motivated government action.\n\n       We have previously acknowledged that the “fabric of substantive due process, as\n\nwoven by our courts, encompasses at least two very different threads.” Id. The first\n\n“thread” of substantive due process applies to legislative acts. A legislative act is,\n\n“generally[,] laws and broad executive regulations” which “apply to large segments of\n\nsociety”— as distinguished from a non-legislative, or executive act, which “typically\n\nappl[ies] to one person or to a limited number of persons.” Id. at 139 n.1. A legislative\n\nact that limits a fundamental right will survive a substantive due process challenge only if\n\nit is necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. Id. at 139. When a\n\nfundamental right is not at stake, a law must be rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest in order to survive a substantive due process challenge. Id.\n\n       The second “thread” of substantive due process jurisprudence analyzes “non-\n\nlegislative,” or executive, government actions. Non-legislative government acts may not\n\narbitrarily infringe on fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. Id. at 139. And\n\neven where non-legislative action infringes on a fundamental right, only the “most\n\negregious official conduct can be said to be ‘arbitrary in the constitutional sense.’”\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\fBoyanowski v. Capital Area Intermediate Unit, 215 F.3d 396, 400 (3d Cir. 2000) (citing\n\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846 (1998) (emphasis in orginal)). Such\n\nabuse of power must “shock[] the conscience.” Id. at 401 (citing Lewis, 523 U.S. at 846).\n\n       1.     Adoption of the Ordinance does not violate the Koorns’ substantive due\n              process rights.\n\n       The Koorns argue that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in\n\nlight of evidence that the Ordinance was instigated by and adopted with the improper\n\nmotive of racial animus. They apply erroneously the second-thread analysis, reserved to\n\nexecutive action, to a legislative act. Rather, the Ordinance’s adoption is properly\n\nanalyzed under the first thread of substantive due process—whether it is rationally related\n\nto a legitimate government interest, or, if fundamental rights are implicated, necessary to\n\npromote a compelling governmental interest. Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 139.\n\n       There is no fundamental right to keep more than a certain number of dogs in a\n\ndwelling unit, so the District Court properly applied rational-basis scrutiny to evaluate the\n\nOrdinance’s constitutionality. See Stern v. Halligan, 158 F.3d 729, 731 (3d Cir. 1998)\n\n(“[W]hen ‘general economic and social welfare legislation’ is alleged to violate\n\nsubstantive due process, it should be struck down only when if fails to meet a minimum\n\nrationality standard, an ‘extremely difficult’ standard for plaintiff to meet.” (quoting\n\nKnight v. Tape, Inc., 935 F. 2d 617, 627 (3d Cir. 1991))). Thus, to satisfy the rational-\n\nbasis test, the Ordinance need only be rationally related to any legitimate government\n\npurpose. See id. The Ordinance need not be narrowly tailored to achieving that\n\n                                              6\n\flegitimate end. Id. at 734 (“Mere over- or underinclusiveness will not invalidate social\n\nwelfare regulation so long as the state action represents a rational response to a legitimate\n\nproblem.”); Rogin v. Bensalem Township, 616 F.2d 680, 689 (3d Cir. 1980) (“The law\n\nneed not be in every respect logically consistent with its aims to be constitutional. It is\n\nenough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the\n\nparticular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it.” (quoting Williamson v.\n\nLee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483 (1955))).\n\n       Protecting residents’ health and safety is a legitimate interest of municipal\n\ngovernment. 4 Stern, 158 F.3d at 732 (“Protecting the health, safety, and general welfare\n\nof township inhabitants . . . is plainly in the public interest.”). Large concentrations of\n\ndogs can be dangerous and unsanitary. As a result, a municipality may rationally\n\nconclude that limiting the number of dogs in any given dwelling will protect the health\n\nand safety of its residents. The Township does not need to prove that the number of dogs\n\n\n\n   4\n    The Koorns argue that the Ordinance’s improper purpose is evidenced in part by its\n“preemption” by the New Jersey dangerous dog statute, N.J.S.A. § 4:19-17–34. The\nstatute imposes notice and licensing requirements on owners of dogs found to be\n“potentially dangerous” or “vicious” by a municipal court. The statute provides:\n        The provisions of this act shall supersede any law, ordinance, or regulation\n        concerning vicious or potentially dangerous dogs, any specific breed of dog,\n        or any other type of dog inconsistent with this act enacted by any\n        municipality, county, or county or local board of health.\nId. § 4:19-36 (emphasis added). A board of health ordinance limiting the number\nof dogs a person may keep at a dwelling is not inconsistent with a statute imposing\nrequirements on owners of certain dangerous dogs. Hence the Koorns are wrong\nto argue that the Ordinance is preempted.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fthey chose to allow was any more or less rational than any other number, distinguish\n\nbetween large and small dogs, address other pets such as cats, or impose sanitation\n\nstandards, as the Koorns allege. See Stern, 158 F.3d at 734; Rogin, 616 F.2d at 689.\n\nThus, as properly analyzed under the first thread of substantive due process, the\n\nOrdinance does not impermissibly limit the Koorns’ substantive due process rights.\n\n       2.     The Koorns do not allege that any specific non-legislative acts were\n              improperly motivated by racial animus.\n\n       Under the second thread of substantive due process, arbitrary and improperly\n\nmotivated non-legislative acts that directly infringe on a person’s fundamental rights are\n\nunconstitutional. Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 139. As explained above, this analysis does not\n\napply to the legislative act of the Ordinance’s enactment. Other than that, the only non-\n\nlegislative acts that the Koorns allege were improperly motivated by racial animus are the\n\nMayor’s and Committeeman’s alleged racist remarks.5 However, even if proven, these\n\nacts had no direct, legal effect on the Koorns’ property rights. See Boyanowski, 215 F. 3d\n\nat 401 (slurs and innuendos made by government official did not directly infringe on\n\nplaintiff’s property right). Certainly they had no legal effect on a requisite fundamental\n\nright. 6 Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 140.\n\n\n   5\n    The Koorns appear to argue that enforcement actions under the Ordinance (which\nwould qualify as non-legislative acts) were improperly motivated as well, but there is no\nevidence that any such enforcement occurred—especially in light of the negotiated stay of\nenforcement between the parties.\n   6\n   While they correctly point out that ownership is a substantive property interest,\nDeBlasio v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 53 F.3d 592, 600 (3d Cir. 1995), the Koorns make\n\n                                             8\n\f       Furthermore, the Koorns do not allege any conduct so egregious that it “shocks the\n\nconscience.” 7 Boyanowski, 215 F.3d at 401; see also Cruz-Erazo v. Rivera-Montañez,\n\n212 F.3d 617, 622–24 (1st Cir. 2000) (police officers’ oral threats and repeated\n\nharassment (but not physically intrusive or violent conduct) that did not “strike at the\n\nbasic fabric” of a protected relationship, such as the parent-child relationship, was not\n\nsufficiently egregious as to “shock the conscience”); Collins v. Cundy, 603 F.2d 825, 827\n\n(10th Cir. 1979) (allegation that sheriff laughed at and threatened to hang a prisoner did\n\n\nno case that there is a fundamental property right to keep more than a certain number of\ndogs in or near a dwelling unit. Nor could they have, as we have previously noted: “[W]e\nhave so far limited non-legislative substantive due process review to cases involving real\nproperty ownership.” Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 141 (emphasis added). But regardless, the\nOrdinance forecloses neither the Koorns’ real property ownership nor their ownership of\ndogs; it simply restricts them from keeping more than six in or near their dwelling.\n   7\n    The Koorns cite Bello v. Walker, 840 F.2d 1124, 1129 (3d Cir. 1988), in support of\ntheir argument that “improper motive” such as “personal interest or political partisanship”\nis sufficient to establish a substantive due process violation. Their reliance on Bello is\nmisplaced for two reasons. First, as the Koorns would have discovered upon the most\ncursory of citation-checks, Bello has been effectively overruled:\n        We hold that [County of Sacramento v.] Lewis [,523 U.S. 833 (1998)\n        (requiring evidence of conduct “shocking to the conscience” in order to find\n        violation of substantive due process)] has superceded [sic] prior decisions\n        of our Court holding that a plaintiff asserting a municipal land-use decision\n        violated substantive due process need only show that the municipal officers\n        acted with an “improper motive.” Thus, Bello v. Walker, 840 F.2d 1124\n        (3d Cir. 1988), and its progeny are no longer good law.\nUnited Artists Theater Circuit, Inc. v. Township of Warrington, 316 F.3d 392, 394 (3d\nCir. 2003).\n        Second, as evident from the very language the Koorns chose to excerpt in their\nbrief, Bello involved an improperly-motivated non-legislative act, the issuance of\nbuilding permits, which is analyzed under a separate thread of substantive due process\nfrom the legislative act at issue here.\n\n\n                                              9\n\fnot state a constitutional claim under § 1983); Shabazz v. Cole, 69 F. Supp. 2d 177, 200\n\n(D. Mass. 1999) (“Without even a suggestion of physical injury, [state prison librarian’s]\n\nverbal abuse and racial epithets, although continuing for a long period of time, fall short\n\nof conscience shocking conduct.”).\n\n       For these reasons, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the\n\nTownship dismissing the Koorns’ substantive due process claims.\n\nB.     Procedural Due Process Claims\n\n       The Koorns assert that the Ordinance creates an “irrebutable presumption . . . that\n\nmore than six dogs, kept ‘in or about’ a dwelling, creates a health hazard . . . irrespective\n\nof any other factors, without any procedure for the homeowner to prove otherwise. . . .”\n\nBut their argument that the District Court should have recognized this as a valid\n\nprocedural due process claim is unpersuasive.\n\n       The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the government employ appropriate\n\nprocedural safeguards when depriving citizens of liberty or property interests recognized\n\nunder the Constitution. See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332-333 (1976).\n\nThe Koorns are correct that the statutes creating permanent irrebutable presumptions\n\nsometimes violate procedural due process. E.g., Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441 (1973)\n\n(state law providing that married students living in Connecticut who applied to the state\n\nuniversity from outside Connecticut were irrebutably presumed to be out-of-state students\n\nviolated procedural due process). But the Koorns are wrong to suggest that the Ordinance\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcreates a presumption that more than six dogs creates a health hazard. Even though the\n\nOrdinance is justified by a health and safety rationale, it applies to all dwellings at which\n\nmore than six dogs are kept—not just those at which more than six dogs constitute a\n\nhealth hazard.8 And, as discussed above, such narrow tailoring is not required. Stern v.\n\nHalligan, 158 F.3d 729, 734 (3d Cir. 1998) (“Mere over- or underinclusiveness will not\n\ninvalidate social welfare regulation so long as the state action represents a rational\n\nresponse to a legitimate problem.”). The Ordinance does not create an irrebutable\n\npresumption and it does not violate the Koorns’ procedural due process rights.\n\nC.       Ex Post Facto Claim\n\n         The Koorns argue that the Ordinance violates the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto\n\nClause, Art. I, § 9 cl. 3, because it imposes restrictions on activity—the raising of dogs at\n\ntheir home—that was legal at the time they began it. “The ex post facto prohibition\n\nforbids Congress and the states to enact any law which imposes a punishment for an act\n\nwhich was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes additional punishment\n\nto that then prescribed.” Weaver v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28 (1981) (internal quotations\n\nomitted). Two critical elements exist for a criminal law to be ex post facto: “it must be\n\n\n\n     8\n    Under the Koorns’ rationale, any health- or safety-related regulation that imposed\nsome restriction would create an irrebutable presumption that the restricted conduct is\ndangerous or unhealthy. Under this premise, the Koorns would, one conjectures, argue\nthat the law requiring drivers to stop at stop signs violates their procedural due process\nrights by creating an “irrebutable presumption” that not stopping is hazardous, without\ngiving the Koorns an opportunity to demonstrate, in a particular circumstance, that not\nstopping is safe.\n\n                                              11\n\fretrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must\n\ndisadvantage the offender affected by it.” Id. at 29. The Ordinance is not retrospective.\n\nIt does not impose any punishment for any conduct occurring before its enactment.\n\nTherefore, the District Court correctly denied the Koorns’ Ex Post Facto Clause claim.\n\nD.          Fair Housing Act and Other Civil Rights Claims\n\n            The Koorns argue that the District Court erred in not recognizing their claims\n\nunder any of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and 42 U.S.C. § 1982.\n\nThey “rely substantially upon the McDonnell Douglas presumption” 9 with respect to\n\nthose claims. Because the Koorns do not make out cognizable claims under these\n\nstatutory provisions and do not qualify for the McDonnell Douglas presumption, the\n\nDistrict Court correctly granted the Township’s summary judgment motion on those\n\nclaims.\n\n            1.     Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3617\n\n            Under the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3604–31, it is unlawful for any person to refuse to sell or otherwise make unavailable\n\na dwelling to any person on the basis of race. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). It is also unlawful to\n\n“coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of”\n\nthat person’s right to have a dwelling. Id. §§ 3617, 3604. “Dwelling” means a “building\n\n. . . designed for occupancy as a residence by one or more families.” Id. § 3602(b).\n\n\n\n     9\n         See discussion at subsection D.3 infra.\n\n                                                   12\n\f              a.     Section 3604(a)\n\n       To make out a claim under § 3604(a), the Koorns must assert, first, that the\n\nTownship denied or made housing unavailable to them and, second, that the Township’s\n\nactions were based on the Koorns’ race. Edwards v. Johnston County Health Dep’t, 885\n\nF.2d 1215, 1221 (4th Cir. 1989). The Koorns’ FHA claim is deficient in that (1)\n\nTownship did not “otherwise make unavailable” the Koorns’ dwelling, and (2) the\n\nTownship’s actions were not made “on the basis of race.”\n\n                     (i)    “Otherwise make unavailable”\n\n       The Koorns claim that the actions of Township officials, “including without\n\nlimitation the enactment of the Ordinance, were committed with the deliberate intent of\n\nharassing, intimidating, and coercing plaintiffs, and to deprive them of the use and\n\nenjoyment of their home, and for the purpose of creating such a hostile living\n\nenvironment that plaintiffs would decide to leave their home, and perhaps the Town.”\n\nHowever, in limiting the number of dogs a person may keep at a dwelling, the Ordinance\n\ndoes not “make unavailable” the Koorns’ right to have a dwelling in which to reside. As\n\nsuch, the enactment and enforcement of the Ordinance does not violate the FHA.\n\n                     (ii)   “On the Basis of Race”\n\n       “A Title VIII claim must rest, in the first instance, upon a showing that the\n\nchallenged action by a defendant had a racially discriminatory effect.” Resident Advisory\n\nBd. v. Rizzo, 564 F.2d 126, 148 (3d Cir. 1977). Discriminatory effect may be proved by\n\n                                             13\n\fshowing either “adverse impact to a particular minority group” or “harm to the\n\ncommunity generally by the perpetuation of segregation.” Huntington Branch, NAACP v.\n\nTown of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926, 937 (2d Cir.), aff’d in part, 488 U.S. 15 (1988). The\n\nKoorns make no showing that the Ordinance affects “a particular minority group.” The\n\nOrdinance affects all Township citizens, white and minority alike. Nor is there any\n\nevidence that the Ordinance is likely to affect the Township’s citizens along racial lines.\n\nAs the District Court stated, “the fact that the first person an Ordinance affects is a person\n\nof color does not negate the fact that such Ordinance is a legitimate governmental\n\nexercise.” Koorn v. Lacey Township, No. 01-79, at 4 (D.N.J. Dec. 23, 2002). As a result,\n\nthe Koorns cannot sustain a claim under § 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n              b.     Section 3617\n\n       The Fair Housing Act also makes it unlawful to “coerce, intimidate, threaten, or\n\ninterfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of . . . any right granted or\n\nprotected by” various sections of Title VIII, including Section 3604, which secures a\n\nperson’s right not to be denied a dwelling on the basis of race. 42 U.S.C. § 3617. As\n\ndiscussed above, the Township’s enactment of the Ordinance limiting the number of dogs\n\nthat a person may keep at a dwelling does not interfere with the Koorns’ right to have a\n\ndwelling nor does it discriminate on the basis of race. For these same reasons, the Koorns\n\ndo not successfully make out a claim under § 3617.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       2.     42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1982\n\n       The Koorns claim that the actions of the Township officials “denied them equal\n\nbenefits of the law in the security of their persons and property, and to make and enforce\n\ncontracts, under 42 U.S.C. 1981” and “their equal rights to own real property under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1982.” They do not identify a distinct claim under either statute.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides: “All persons . . . shall have the same right in every\n\nState and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to\n\nthe full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and\n\nproperty as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1982 mandates that “[a]ll\n\ncitizens shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as in enjoyed by white\n\ncitizens thereof, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal\n\nproperty.”\n\n       The Ordinance limits the number of dogs that the Koorns can keep at any one\n\ndwelling. It does not foreclose them from owning any number of dogs or from owning\n\nany particular dwellings. For sure the Ordinance does not affect their right to “inherit,\n\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, or convey real or personal property.” Nor does it infringe on\n\nthe Koorns’ right to make and enforce contracts. Furthermore, the Ordinance does not\n\ndeny the Koorns any right that is “enjoyed by white citizens thereof.” The Ordinance\n\nforecloses white citizens from keeping more than six dogs at a dwelling, just as it\n\nforecloses the Koorns. Thus the enactment of the Ordinance does not violate §§ 1981 or\n\n                                              15\n\f1982. Nor do the Koorns demonstrate how any other acts of the Township officials\n\ninfringe on their §§ 1981 and 1982 rights.\n\n       3.     The McDonnell Douglas Presumption\n\n       The Koorns allege, with respect to their FHA, §§ 1981, 1982 claims, that they are\n\nentitled to the burden-shifting presumption of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411\n\nU.S. 792 (1973). A plaintiff who establishes a prima facie case for discriminatory effect\n\ncan shift the burden to defendants for justification of acts with discriminatory effects.\n\nResident Advisory Board, 564 F.2d at 149. A prima facie case consists of proof that (1)\n\nplaintiffs are in a protected class, (2) they applied for and were qualified to rent or\n\npurchase housing, (3) they were rejected, and (4) the housing opportunity remained\n\navailable. Robinson v. 12 Lofts Realty, Inc., 610 F.2d 1032 (2d Cir. 1979). While the\n\nKoorns establish that they are racial minorities and that they are qualified for the\n\nownership of their home, they admit that the third and fourth elements have not been\n\nsatisfied. (J.A. at 348). The Ordinance limiting the number of dogs they may keep does\n\nnot reject them from their dwelling. And even if it did, there is no way the Koorns could\n\npredict that their house would “remain available.” Accordingly, the Koorns cannot rely\n\non the McDonnell Douglas presumption to establish a cause of action under the Fair\n\nHousing Act or 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982.\n\nE.     Conspiracy Claims\n\n       The Koorns allege that the Mayor, Committeemen, Township employees, Board of\n\n                                              16\n\fHealth, and the complaining neighbors “conspired, by agreement tacit or otherwise, to\n\ncause the Board of Health to enact the Ordinance” and argued that the District Court erred\n\nin not finding this to be a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). We disagree.\n\n         In order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege: (1) a\n\nconspiracy; (2) motivated by a racial animus designed to deprive, directly or indirectly,\n\nany person or class of persons to the equal protection of the laws; (3) an act in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to person or property or the deprivation of any right or\n\nprivilege of a citizen of the United States. Lake v. Arnold, 112 F.3d 682, 685 (3d Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n         As noted already, the Ordinance is a legitimate social welfare legislation that is\n\nneutral on its face and applies to all Township residents. It does no injury to the Koorns\n\nor their property. As a result, the Koorns do not have a cognizable § 1985(3) claim as a\n\nmatter of law. Thus the Koorns’ claim that Township officials failed to halt a conspiracy\n\nin violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986 must also fail. See Mian v. Donaldson, Lufkin &\n\nJenrette Sec. Corp., 7 F.3d 1085, 1088 (2d Cir. 1993) (“[A] § 1986 claim must be\n\npredicated upon a valid § 1985 claim.”); Grimes v. Smith, 776 F.2d 1359, 1363 n.4 (7th\n\nCir. 1985) (“[L]iability under § 1986 is derivative of § 1985(3) liability; without a\n\nviolation of § 1985(3), there can be no violation of § 1986.”). The District Court\n\ncorrectly dismissed the Koorns’ conspiracy claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fF.     Pendant State Claims\n\n       Finally, the Koorns argue that the District Court erred in not recognizing their\n\nvarious claims under state law. However, because the Court properly dismissed the\n\nKoorns’ federal claims, it properly refused to exercise jurisdiction over their pendant state\n\nclaims. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n\n                                             III.\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s granting the Township\n\nsummary judgment on the Koorns’ claims.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE CLERK:\n\n       Please file the foregoing Opinion.\n\n                                            By the Court,\n\n                                            /s/ Thomas L.

Civil Action No. 01-cv-00079)\n            District Judge: Honorable Anne E. Thompson\n\n\n             Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                        September 16, 2003\n\n       Before: ALITO, AM BRO and CHERTOFF, Circuit Judges\n\n                  (Opinion filed October 17, 2003)\n\f                                           OPINION\n\n\nAM BRO, Circuit Judge:\n\n          Plaintiffs Shain and Rafaela Koorn brought a seventeen-count complaint against\n\nLacey Township and various Township officials and departments,1 alleging the\n\nTownship’s enactment of an animal control ordinance violates their constitutional and\n\nstatutory civil rights because it was motivated by racial animus. The United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey granted the Township’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on all claims, though its written decision focused primarily on the Koorns’\n\nsubstantive due process claim. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n                                             Facts\n\n          Shain Koorn (who is African-American) and Rafaela Koorn (who is Hispanic)\n\npurchased a home and property in the Township of Lacey, New Jersey, in 1998. After\n\nmoving in with many dogs (according to the Koorns, “less than 20”), they were soon\n\ninformed by the local code enforcement officer of a Township ordinance limiting\n\nproperty owners to six dogs. Later, both the Koorns and the Township discovered that\n\nwhat the code enforcement officer had believed was an official ordinance was in fact an\n\ninformal policy. In response to complaints from the Koorns’ neighbors, in November\n\n\n\n   1\n       For convenience, the defendants will be collectively referred to as “the Township.”\n\n                                               2\n\f2000 the Lacey Township Board of Health formally enacted an Animal Control\n\nOrdinance (“Ordinance”) limiting the number of dogs that may be kept “in or about a\n\ndwelling” to six.2\n\n       It is not necessary to describe in detail the ongoing dispute between the Koorns,\n\ntheir neighbors, and Township officials. It suffices that some of the Koorns’ neighbors\n\nbegan complaining to Township officials about the Koorns’ dogs and about certain lights\n\ninstalled by the Koorns as a security measure. The Koorns allege that the enforcement\n\nactions brought under local dog-barking and lighting ordinances were harassing to them.\n\nAs for the enactment of the Ordinance, the relevant additional facts are the alleged racist\n\nstatements the Koorns attribute to certain Township officials who were instrumental in\n\nthe Ordinance’s enactment. One member of the Township Committee—indeed its liaison\n\nto the Board of Health, Ronald Sterling—was an admitted “motivating factor” in the\n\nenactment of the Ordinance. The Koorns allege that Sterling made a racist\n\nremark—consisting of a lynching reference—at a televised Township Committee\n\nmeeting. The Koorns also allege that then-Mayor Parker, in conversation with the code\n\n\n\n\n   2\n    The Ordinance states in relevant part: “No person shall maintain, keep, or harbor ... or\npermit to be maintained, kept or harbored in or about any dwelling or dwelling unit under\nhis control a total of more than six (6) dogs over seven (7) months of age or which\npossess a set of permanent teeth.” The Ordinance was passed pursuant to the Board of\nHealth’s authority under N.J.S.A. 26:3-31 to “pass, alter, or amend ordinances and make\nrules and regulations in regard to the public health within its jurisdiction, for the\nfollowing purposes...K. to regulate, control or prohibit the keeping and slaughtering of\nanimals.”\n\n                                             3\n\fenforcement officer, made a racist reference to the Koorns.\n\n         In January 2001, the Koorns filed a complaint in the District Court alleging that the\n\nenactment of the Ordinance violated the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment\n\n(substantive and procedural due process), the Ex Post Facto Clause of Article I, Section\n\nof the Constitution, the Fair Housing Act and other civil rights statutes, and various state\n\nlaws. They simultaneously sought to enjoin the Township from enforcing the Ordinance\n\nagainst them. After the District Court denied their motion for injunction, the Koorns\n\nnegotiated with the Township for a stay of enforcement. They then amended their\n\nDistrict Court complaint to replace the request for injunctive relief with a request for\n\ndamages. In August 2002, the Township moved for summary judgment, which the\n\nDistrict Court granted. Koorn v. Lacey Township, No. 01-79 (D.N.J. Dec. 23, 2002).\n\nThe Koorns appeal.3\n\n                                              II.\n                                          Discussion\n\nA.       Substantive Due Process Claims\n\n         The Koorns argue that the adoption and enforcement of the Ordinance violates\n\ntheir Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process rights. The Fourteenth Amendment\n\nprovides that no State shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due\n\n\n\n\n     3\n    We have jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1291.

This substantive\n\ncomponent protects citizens from arbitrary and improperly-motivated government action.\n\n       We have previously acknowledged that the “fabric of substantive due process, as\n\nwoven by our courts, encompasses at least two very different threads.” Id. The first\n\n“thread” of substantive due process applies to legislative acts. A legislative act is,\n\n“generally[,] laws and broad executive regulations” which “apply to large segments of\n\nsociety”— as distinguished from a non-legislative, or executive act, which “typically\n\nappl[ies] to one person or to a limited number of persons.” Id. at 139 n.1. A legislative\n\nact that limits a fundamental right will survive a substantive due process challenge only if\n\nit is necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. Id. at 139. When a\n\nfundamental right is not at stake, a law must be rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest in order to survive a substantive due process challenge.

Adoption of the Ordinance does not violate the Koorns’ substantive due\n              process rights.\n\n       The Koorns argue that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in\n\nlight of evidence that the Ordinance was instigated by and adopted with the improper\n\nmotive of racial animus. They apply erroneously the second-thread analysis, reserved to\n\nexecutive action, to a legislative act.

Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 139.\n\n       There is no fundamental right to keep more than a certain number of dogs in a\n\ndwelling unit, so the District Court properly applied rational-basis scrutiny to evaluate the\n\nOrdinance’s constitutionality.

Large concentrations of\n\ndogs can be dangerous and unsanitary. As a result, a municipality may rationally\n\nconclude that limiting the number of dogs in any given dwelling will protect the health\n\nand safety of its residents. The Township does not need to prove that the number of dogs\n\n\n\n   4\n    The Koorns argue that the Ordinance’s improper purpose is evidenced in part by its\n“preemption” by the New Jersey dangerous dog statute, N.J.S.A. § 4:19-17–34. The\nstatute imposes notice and licensing requirements on owners of dogs found to be\n“potentially dangerous” or “vicious” by a municipal court. The statute provides:\n        The provisions of this act shall supersede any law, ordinance, or regulation\n        concerning vicious or potentially dangerous dogs, any specific breed of dog,\n        or any other type of dog inconsistent with this act enacted by any\n        municipality, county, or county or local board of health.\nId. § 4:19-36 (emphasis added). A board of health ordinance limiting the number\nof dogs a person may keep at a dwelling is not inconsistent with a statute imposing\nrequirements on owners of certain dangerous dogs. Hence the Koorns are wrong\nto argue that the Ordinance is preempted.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fthey chose to allow was any more or less rational than any other number, distinguish\n\nbetween large and small dogs, address other pets such as cats, or impose sanitation\n\nstandards, as the Koorns allege. See Stern, 158 F.3d at 734; Rogin, 616 F.2d at 689.\n\nThus, as properly analyzed under the first thread of substantive due process, the\n\nOrdinance does not impermissibly limit the Koorns’ substantive due process rights.\n\n       2.     The Koorns do not allege that any specific non-legislative acts were\n              improperly motivated by racial animus.\n\n       Under the second thread of substantive due process, arbitrary and improperly\n\nmotivated non-legislative acts that directly infringe on a person’s fundamental rights are\n\nunconstitutional. Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 139. As explained above, this analysis does not\n\napply to the legislative act of the Ordinance’s enactment. Other than that, the only non-\n\nlegislative acts that the Koorns allege were improperly motivated by racial animus are the\n\nMayor’s and Committeeman’s alleged racist remarks.5 However, even if proven, these\n\nacts had no direct, legal effect on the Koorns’ property rights. See Boyanowski, 215 F. 3d\n\nat 401 (slurs and innuendos made by government official did not directly infringe on\n\nplaintiff’s property right). Certainly they had no legal effect on a requisite fundamental\n\nright. 6 Nicholas, 227 F.3d at 140.\n\n\n   5\n    The Koorns appear to argue that enforcement actions under the Ordinance (which\nwould qualify as non-legislative acts) were improperly motivated as well, but there is no\nevidence that any such enforcement occurred—especially in light of the negotiated stay of\nenforcement between the parties.\n   6\n   While they correctly point out that ownership is a substantive property interest,\nDeBlasio v.

Mass. 1999) (“Without even a suggestion of physical injury, [state prison librarian’s]\n\nverbal abuse and racial epithets, although continuing for a long period of time, fall short\n\nof conscience shocking conduct.”).\n\n       For these reasons, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the\n\nTownship dismissing the Koorns’ substantive due process claims.\n\nB.     Procedural Due Process Claims\n\n       The Koorns assert that the Ordinance creates an “irrebutable presumption . . . that\n\nmore than six dogs, kept ‘in or about’ a dwelling, creates a health hazard . . . irrespective\n\nof any other factors, without any procedure for the homeowner to prove otherwise. . . .”\n\nBut their argument that the District Court should have recognized this as a valid\n\nprocedural due process claim is unpersuasive.\n\n       The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the government employ appropriate\n\nprocedural safeguards when depriving citizens of liberty or property interests recognized\n\nunder the Constitution. See, e.g., Mathews v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332-333 (1976).\n\nThe Koorns are correct that the statutes creating permanent irrebutable presumptions\n\nsometimes violate procedural due process. E.g., Vlandis v. Kline, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108810\"><a href=\"/opinion/108810/vlandis-v-kline/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973)\n\n(state law providing that married students living in Connecticut who applied to the state\n\nuniversity from outside Connecticut were irrebutably presumed to be out-of-state students\n\nviolated procedural due process). But the Koorns are wrong to suggest that the Ordinance\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fcreates a presumption that more than six dogs creates a health hazard. Even though the\n\nOrdinance is justified by a health and safety rationale, it applies to all dwellings at which\n\nmore than six dogs are kept—not just those at which more than six dogs constitute a\n\nhealth hazard.8 And, as discussed above, such narrow tailoring is not required. Stern v.\n\nHalligan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758672\"><a href=\"/opinion/758672/steven-b-stern-michele-stern-the-lorenzo-trust-v-francis-x-halligan-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (3d Cir. 1998) (“Mere over- or underinclusiveness will not\n\ninvalidate social welfare regulation so long as the state action represents a rational\n\nresponse to a legitimate problem.”). The Ordinance does not create an irrebutable\n\npresumption and it does not violate the Koorns’ procedural due process rights.\n\nC.       Ex Post Facto Claim\n\n         The Koorns argue that the Ordinance violates the Constitution’s Ex Post Facto\n\nClause, Art. I, § 9 cl. 3, because it imposes restrictions on activity—the raising of dogs at\n\ntheir home—that was legal at the time they began it. “The ex post facto prohibition\n\nforbids Congress and the states to enact any law which imposes a punishment for an act\n\nwhich was not punishable at the time it was committed; or imposes additional punishment\n\nto that then prescribed.” Weaver v. Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110413\"><a href=\"/opinion/110413/weaver-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (1981) (internal quotations\n\nomitted). Two critical elements exist for a criminal law to be ex post facto: “it must be\n\n\n\n     8\n    Under the Koorns’ rationale, any health- or safety-related regulation that imposed\nsome restriction would create an irrebutable presumption that the restricted conduct is\ndangerous or unhealthy. Under this premise, the Koorns would, one conjectures, argue\nthat the law requiring drivers to stop at stop signs violates their procedural due process\nrights by creating an “irrebutable presumption” that not stopping is hazardous, without\ngiving the Koorns an opportunity to demonstrate, in a particular circumstance, that not\nstopping is safe.\n\n                                              11\n\fretrospective, that is, it must apply to events occurring before its enactment, and it must\n\ndisadvantage the offender affected by it.” Id. at 29. The Ordinance is not retrospective.\n\nIt does not impose any punishment for any conduct occurring before its enactment.\n\nTherefore, the District Court correctly denied the Koorns’ Ex Post Facto Clause claim.\n\nD.          Fair Housing Act and Other Civil Rights Claims\n\n            The Koorns argue that the District Court erred in not recognizing their claims\n\nunder any of the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and 42 U.S.C. § 1982.\n\nThey “rely substantially upon the McDonnell Douglas presumption” 9 with respect to\n\nthose claims. Because the Koorns do not make out cognizable claims under these\n\nstatutory provisions and do not qualify for the McDonnell Douglas presumption, the\n\nDistrict Court correctly granted the Township’s summary judgment motion on those\n\nclaims.\n\n            1.     Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), 3617\n\n            Under the Fair Housing Act, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3604–31, it is unlawful for any person to refuse to sell or otherwise make unavailable\n\na dwelling to any person on the basis of race. 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). It is also unlawful to\n\n“coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of”\n\nthat person’s right to have a dwelling. Id. §§ 3617, 3604. “Dwelling” means a “building\n\n. . . designed for occupancy as a residence by one or more families.” Id. § 3602(b).\n\n\n\n     9\n         See discussion at subsection D.3 infra.\n\n                                                   12\n\f              a.     Section 3604(a)\n\n       To make out a claim under § 3604(a), the Koorns must assert, first, that the\n\nTownship denied or made housing unavailable to them and, second, that the Township’s\n\nactions were based on the Koorns’ race. Edwards v. Johnston County Health Dep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529734\"><a href=\"/opinion/529734/willie-b-edwards-jr-queen-hayes-james-hayes-and-earl-jaspar-forney/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1221 (4th Cir. 1989). The Koorns’ FHA claim is deficient in that (1)\n\nTownship did not “otherwise make unavailable” the Koorns’ dwelling, and (2) the\n\nTownship’s actions were not made “on the basis of race.”\n\n                     (i)    “Otherwise make unavailable”\n\n       The Koorns claim that the actions of Township officials, “including without\n\nlimitation the enactment of the Ordinance, were committed with the deliberate intent of\n\nharassing, intimidating, and coercing plaintiffs, and to deprive them of the use and\n\nenjoyment of their home, and for the purpose of creating such a hostile living\n\nenvironment that plaintiffs would decide to leave their home, and perhaps the Town.”\n\nHowever, in limiting the number of dogs a person may keep at a dwelling, the Ordinance\n\ndoes not “make unavailable” the Koorns’ right to have a dwelling in which to reside. As\n\nsuch, the enactment and enforcement of the Ordinance does not violate the FHA.\n\n                     (ii)   “On the Basis of Race”\n\n       “A Title VIII claim must rest, in the first instance, upon a showing that the\n\nchallenged action by a defendant had a racially discriminatory effect.” Resident Advisory\n\nBd. v.

The\n\nKoorns make no showing that the Ordinance affects “a particular minority group.” The\n\nOrdinance affects all Township citizens, white and minority alike. Nor is there any\n\nevidence that the Ordinance is likely to affect the Township’s citizens along racial lines.\n\nAs the District Court stated, “the fact that the first person an Ordinance affects is a person\n\nof color does not negate the fact that such Ordinance is a legitimate governmental\n\nexercise.” Koorn v. Lacey Township, No. 01-79, at 4 (D.N.J. Dec. 23, 2002). As a result,\n\nthe Koorns cannot sustain a claim under § 3604(a) of the Fair Housing Act.\n\n              b.     Section 3617\n\n       The Fair Housing Act also makes it unlawful to “coerce, intimidate, threaten, or\n\ninterfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of . . . any right granted or\n\nprotected by” various sections of Title VIII, including Section 3604, which secures a\n\nperson’s right not to be denied a dwelling on the basis of race. 42 U.S.C. § 3617. As\n\ndiscussed above, the Township’s enactment of the Ordinance limiting the number of dogs\n\nthat a person may keep at a dwelling does not interfere with the Koorns’ right to have a\n\ndwelling nor does it discriminate on the basis of race. For these same reasons, the Koorns\n\ndo not successfully make out a claim under § 3617.\n\n\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       2.     42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1982\n\n       The Koorns claim that the actions of the Township officials “denied them equal\n\nbenefits of the law in the security of their persons and property, and to make and enforce\n\ncontracts, under 42 U.S.C. 1981” and “their equal rights to own real property under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1982.” They do not identify a distinct claim under either statute.\n\n       42 U.S.C. § 1981 provides: “All persons . . . shall have the same right in every\n\nState and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to\n\nthe full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and\n\nproperty as is enjoyed by white citizens. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1982 mandates that “[a]ll\n\ncitizens shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as in enjoyed by white\n\ncitizens thereof, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal\n\nproperty.”\n\n       The Ordinance limits the number of dogs that the Koorns can keep at any one\n\ndwelling. It does not foreclose them from owning any number of dogs or from owning\n\nany particular dwellings. For sure the Ordinance does not affect their right to “inherit,\n\npurchase, lease, sell, hold, or convey real or personal property.” Nor does it infringe on\n\nthe Koorns’ right to make and enforce contracts. Furthermore, the Ordinance does not\n\ndeny the Koorns any right that is “enjoyed by white citizens thereof.” The Ordinance\n\nforecloses white citizens from keeping more than six dogs at a dwelling, just as it\n\nforecloses the Koorns. Thus the enactment of the Ordinance does not violate §§ 1981 or\n\n                                              15\n\f1982. Nor do the Koorns demonstrate how any other acts of the Township officials\n\ninfringe on their §§ 1981 and 1982 rights.\n\n       3.     The McDonnell Douglas Presumption\n\n       The Koorns allege, with respect to their FHA, §§ 1981, 1982 claims, that they are\n\nentitled to the burden-shifting presumption of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). A plaintiff who establishes a prima facie case for discriminatory effect\n\ncan shift the burden to defendants for justification of acts with discriminatory effects.\n\nResident Advisory Board, 564 F.2d at 149. A prima facie case consists of proof that (1)\n\nplaintiffs are in a protected class, (2) they applied for and were qualified to rent or\n\npurchase housing, (3) they were rejected, and (4) the housing opportunity remained\n\navailable. Robinson v. 12 Lofts Realty, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"372516\"><a href=\"/opinion/372516/bennett-robinson-v-12-lofts-realty-inc-and-paul-hanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1979). While the\n\nKoorns establish that they are racial minorities and that they are qualified for the\n\nownership of their home, they admit that the third and fourth elements have not been\n\nsatisfied. (J.A. at 348). The Ordinance limiting the number of dogs they may keep does\n\nnot reject them from their dwelling. And even if it did, there is no way the Koorns could\n\npredict that their house would “remain available.” Accordingly, the Koorns cannot rely\n\non the McDonnell Douglas presumption to establish a cause of action under the Fair\n\nHousing Act or 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1982.\n\nE.     Conspiracy Claims\n\n       The Koorns allege that the Mayor, Committeemen, Township employees, Board of\n\n                                              16\n\fHealth, and the complaining neighbors “conspired, by agreement tacit or otherwise, to\n\ncause the Board of Health to enact the Ordinance” and argued that the District Court erred\n\nin not finding this to be a cognizable claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). We disagree.\n\n         In order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), a plaintiff must allege: (1) a\n\nconspiracy; (2) motivated by a racial animus designed to deprive, directly or indirectly,\n\nany person or class of persons to the equal protection of the laws; (3) an act in furtherance\n\nof the conspiracy; and (4) an injury to person or property or the deprivation of any right or\n\nprivilege of a citizen of the United States. Lake v. Arnold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740235\"><a href=\"/opinion/740235/elizabeth-j-arnold-lake-justin-wilson-lake-husband-and-wife-v-frederick/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (3d Cir.\n\n1997).\n\n         As noted already, the Ordinance is a legitimate social welfare legislation that is\n\nneutral on its face and applies to all Township residents. It does no injury to the Koorns\n\nor their property. As a result, the Koorns do not have a cognizable § 1985(3) claim as a\n\nmatter of law. Thus the Koorns’ claim that Township officials failed to halt a conspiracy\n\nin violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986 must also fail. See Mian v. Donaldson, Lufkin &\n\nJenrette Sec. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655506\"><a href=\"/opinion/655506/fed-sec-l-rep-p-97798-tuaha-mian-v-donaldson-lufkin-jenrette/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (2d Cir. 1993) (“[A] § 1986 claim must be\n\npredicated upon a valid § 1985 claim.”); Grimes v.

The District Court\n\ncorrectly dismissed the Koorns’ conspiracy claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fF.     Pendant State Claims\n\n       Finally, the Koorns argue that the District Court erred in not recognizing their\n\nvarious claims under state law. However, because the Court properly dismissed the\n\nKoorns’ federal claims, it properly refused to exercise jurisdiction over their pendant state\n\nclaims. 28 U.S.C. § 1367(c)(3).\n\n\n                                             III.\n                                        Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court’s granting the Township\n\nsummary judgment on the Koorns’ claims.\n\n\n\n\nTO THE CLERK:\n\n       Please file the foregoing Opinion.\n\n                                            By the Court,\n\n                                            /s/ Thomas L.
