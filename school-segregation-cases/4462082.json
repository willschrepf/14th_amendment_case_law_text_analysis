D-1-DC-12-900059\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Now comes the State of Texas and files its brief in response to that of the\n\nappellant.\n\n\n                         STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\n      The State indicted appellant for the third-degree-felony of securing\n\nexecution of a document by deception. V.T.C.A. Penal Code §32.46(b)(5). (CR\n\n12-18). Appellant pled not guilty and had a jury trial on guilt/innocence. (RR II:\n\n7, 23). The jury found appellant guilty of securing execution of a document by\n\ndeception as alleged in the indictment. (CR 182; RR VI: 47-48). The trial judge\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fassessed appellant’s punishment at five years confinement in the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice – Institutional Division. (CR 194). Appellant\n\ntimely filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law. (CR\n\n202-206). Appellant timely filed notice of appeal. (CR 207). The trial judge\n\ncertified appellant’s right to appeal. (CR 186).\n\n\n           STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\nDesignated-Doctor Examinations (DDEs) and Functional Capacity\nEvaluations (FCEs)\n\n      Dr. Daniel Boudreau was a designated doctor for the State of Texas. (RR II:\n\n60). He explained that a designated doctor was a physician who evaluated injured\n\nworkers and was encouraged to be an independent evaluator. (RR II: 60). Dr.\n\nBoudreau referred to his designated-doctor patients as “claims” as they were\n\nassigned by the Texas Department of Insurance, Division of Workers’ Comp. (RR\n\nII: 60-61). He had no doctor-patient relationship with the claims. (RR II: 61).\n\n      Dr. Boudreau worked with North Texas Medical Evaluators (NTME) in\n\nwhat he thought was an independent contractor capacity. (RR II: 61). He worked\n\nwith NTME from 2007 to 2009. (RR II: 64-65). He gave NTME his medical\n\nlicense number for reports and billing and a signature stamp. (RR II: 69-70, 72-\n\n72). But, he did not recall giving NTME a power of attorney. (RR II: 69-70). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNTME did not assign patients to Dr. Boudreau, but it assisted him with scheduling\n\npatients and submitting designated-doctor reports. (RR II: 62).\n\n         For designated-doctor appointments, Dr. Boudreau received 60% of the\n\nmoney collected and NTME took 40% for doing the paperwork and collections.\n\n(RR II: 65). Dr. Boudreau received none of the money collected for FCEs. (RR II:\n\n65). Dr. Boudreau generally ordered an FCE where a person had a\n\nmusculoskeletal or limb problem, but he did not order them as a matter of course.\n\n(RR II: 66, 69). He only “might” order an FCE on a person who had already\n\nreturned to work. (RR II: 69). If Dr. Boudreau had an issue with being paid by\n\nNTME, he contacted appellant.1 (RR II: 62).\n\n         The designated-doctor evaluation was completely separate from the FCE.\n\n(RR II: 80). A technician who conducted the FCEs attended the appointments.\n\n(RR II: 67). The technician sent the results of the FCEs to Dr. Boudreau via email.\n\n(RR II: 78). FCEs generally took 30-40 minutes to complete; Dr. Boudreau had\n\nnever known an FCE to take 4 hours. (RR II: 68).\n\n         State’s exhibit 29 contained a letter presumably written by Dr. Boudreau\n\nordering an FCE for Barbara Boles. (RR XII: 266). Dr. Boudreau thought the\n\nsignature on the letter was very similar to his own, but he could not tell at the time\n\nof trial whether the signature was his or made by the signature stamp. (RR II: 71-\n\n1\n    Dr. Boudreau identified appellant in the courtroom. (RR II: 63).\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f72). The letter had Dr. Boudreau’s name at the top, but Dr. Boudreau did not\n\ngenerate that document. (RR II: 72). The letter, dated April 15, 2009, reflected\n\nthat he ordered an FCE on Barbara Boles after doing a designated-doctor exam on\n\n“him.” (RR II: 72). A second page of the document showed that the FCE lasted for\n\n3 ½ hours, but Dr. Boudreau had never seen an FCE last that long. (RR II: 72).\n\n      State’s exhibit 30, medical billing documents for Jimmy Gomez, also\n\ncontained a document with a signature similar to Dr. Boudreau’s, but again he\n\ncould not verify if that were his actual signature or a signature stamp because he\n\ndid not generate that document either. (RR II: 73). The document bore letterhead\n\nfrom “Marconi Physical Performance Testing,” a company which Dr. Boudreau\n\ndid not know existed until recently. (RR II: 79-80). Dr. Boudreau did not work\n\nfor Marconi Physical Performance Testing or recall ever going to their offices.\n\n(RR II: 63-64). State’s exhibit 30 also reflected an FCE lasting from 10:30 a.m. to\n\n2:30 p.m., but Dr. Boudreau did not recall the occurrence of that FCE. (RR II: 73).\n\nDr. Boudreau had no knowledge that FCEs were being billed out at 16 units per\n\npatient. (RR II: 80).\n\n      Martha Luevano managed the Division of Worker’s Compensation, medical\n\nfee dispute resolution, for the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). (RR III: 10).\n\nThe TDI and the Division of Workers’ Compensation regulated the Texas Mutual\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fInsurance Company (TMIC). (RR III: 16). Luevano testified as an expert in\n\nmedical billing based on her training and experience. (RR III: 12).\n\n       Luevano explained the many acronyms used during this trial and that the\n\nCPT2 code for an FCE was 97750. (RR III: 13-14). “HCFA” was an acronym\n\nused for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before it took on that\n\nname. (RR III: 14). HCFA stood for Health Care Finance Administration before\n\nthe name change, and it typically referred to a paper billing form, the HCFA 1500.\n\n(RR III: 14). The CMS 1500 was also a paper billing form that was used to bill for\n\ncertain professional medical services. (RR III: 15). Luevano used interchangeably\n\nthe terms CMS 1500 and HCFA 1500 in explaining their purpose. (RR III: 15).\n\nTexas Workers’ Compensation used “DDE” for designated-doctor examination,\n\nand it had its own CPT code and rules for billing and reimbursement. (RR III: 15-\n\n16).\n\n       Luevano explained that an FCE was a technical examination that was billed\n\nand paid separately from a DDE. (RR III: 16). With regard to CPT code 97750,\n\nthe AMA CPT code book for 2007 (SX 28) required “one-on-one patient contact, .\n\n. . , physical performance test or measurement, with written report each 15\n\nminutes.” (RR III: 20). The CPT code book for 2008 also required “direct one-on-\n\n\n2\n “CPT” stands for American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology. (RR III:\n14).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fone patient contact, physical performance test or measurement, with report each 15\n\nminutes.” (RR III: 20-21; SX27). The 2009 CPT code book required the same.\n\n(RR III: 21; SX32). The code books for 2006-2009 all required the same direct\n\none-to-one patient contact, face-to-face, where the patient actually performed the\n\nphysical acts of the examination. (RR IV: 7-8).\n\n      On cross-examination, Luevano explained that SX26, the billing\n\ndocumentation or Joann Jackson, was “technically” not an HCFA 1500 but rather\n\nthe more modern version of it, known as the CMS 1500. (RR II: 70-71; RR III:\n\n27-28). Luevano added that Form 1500 was prepared by the healthcare provider\n\nand sent to the insurance carrier. (RR III: 28). Based on that form, the insurance\n\ncarrier determined what payment to make; the form contained a medical diagnosis\n\nvia certain codes. (RR III: 28).\n\n      As for CPT code 97750, Medicare policy dictated that a healthcare provider\n\ncould bill one unit for each 15 minutes spent in direct, one-on-one contact with a\n\npatient. (RR III: 38-39). Any time that a patient was not actively engaged in the\n\nphysical performance examination, tests or measurements was not billable. (RR\n\nIII: 47, 48). Code 97750 required the healthcare provider to prepare a written\n\nreport for a FCE, which differed from the report written by the designated doctor.\n\n(RR III: 39, 40).\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f         Luevano further explained on redirect examination that a healthcare provider\n\ncould not bill for the time spent preparing the written report, reviewing medical\n\nrecords, or travelling to the location for an FCE. (RR III: 41-42, 48; RR IV: 8).\n\nThe maximum allowable units that could be legally billed were 16, which equaled\n\n4 hours, for an FCE. (RR III: 42). Medicare policy allowed for rounding up to\n\none 15-minute increment, viz: eight minutes spent with a patient could be rounded\n\nup to one 15-minute allowable unit. (RR III: 42). The healthcare provider was\n\nresponsible for correctly coding and billing for services. (RR III: 42-43).\n\n         Kathleen Haden, a senior investigator for TMIC, had been the supervisor for\n\nthe Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Unit in February of 2012. (RR III: 53). 3 Haden\n\nidentified SX30 as an HCFA 1500, a health insurance claim form that all doctors\n\nand medical providers used nationally to bill their services. (RR III: 54). State’s\n\nExhibit 30 was designated “1500” at the top of the page, but it reflected “CMS\n\n1500” at the bottom right in small print. Haden noted it used to be HCFA Form\n\n1500, but the name of the form changed to CMS 1500 when the Centers for\n\nMedicaid and Medicare took over for the Health Care Finance Administration.\n\n(RR III: 54). Persons in the business still called the CMS 1500 form by the name\n\nHCFA 1500. (RR III: 54, 127). The term “HCFA” was commonly used within the\n\n\n\n3\n    Haden confirmed that TMIC was located in Austin, Travis County, Texas. (RR III: 54).\n\n\n                                               10\n\findustry. (RR III: 55). The HCFA form would be sent to the TMIC to trigger a\n\npayment of some sort. (RR III: 55).\n\n        Haden explained that TMIC received notice from the TDI when a patient\n\nwas scheduled for a designated-doctor examination. (RR III: 60). The TDI then\n\nchose the doctor and coordinated the date and time of the appointment. (RR III:\n\n60). The TDI notified TMIC of this appointment via an EES-14 form, which\n\nreflected the appointment time and date. (RR III: 60-61). The injured worker was\n\nrequired to show up at that date and time. (RR III: 61).\n\nTestimony from Injured Workers Who Received FCEs\n\n        On July 20, 2007, Jerry Dockray sustained a significant injury to his back,\n\nfour discs in his spine, and his shoulders from a hay-wrapping machine. (RR II:\n\n108-109). Dockray’s employer had Worker’s Compensation insurance with\n\nTMIC, and Dockray filed a claim. (RR II: 109, 114). Almost a year after his\n\ninjury, Dockray had surgery on his neck and then later on his shoulder. (RR II:\n\n109).\n\n        After his surgeries, in February of 2009, Dockray travelled from his home in\n\nParis, Texas, to Sulphur Springs, Texas, for an appointment with a doctor that he\n\nhad not seen before.4 (RR II: 110, 116). The appointment was not in a doctor’s\n\n\n4\n  The doctor was also not from Sulphur Springs and had travelled there for the appointment. (RR\nII: 117).\n\n\n                                              11\n\foffice or a hospital but in a fitness center “or something like that.” (RR II: 110).\n\nThe office space consisted of an office on one side, a waiting room in front, and a\n\nsmall examination room with no equipment. (RR II: 110). The doctor explained\n\nthe purpose of the examination to Dockray, to-wit: to determine the extent of his\n\ninjury. (RR II: 111). Dockray spent only 5-10 minutes with the doctor. (RR II:\n\n113).\n\n        An assistant then had Dockray perform a few tests such as lifting his arm\n\nwithout assistance and sliding his arm up a wall to determine his range of motion.\n\n(RR II: 111, 112). These tests took about 20 minutes, and the doctor did not\n\nobserve Dockray perform these tests. (RR II: 113). Dockray was not asked to lift\n\nanything such as weights or pull anything. (RR II: 112). He did not walk on a\n\nnarrow beam or a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. (RR II: 112). He did not tell\n\nthe medical personnel that he could lift 62 pounds or pull 85 pounds. (RR II: 111,\n\n112). Dockray’s entire appointment lasted only about 45 minutes. (RR II: 112). 5\n\n        Brad Ettinger, owner of a power washing business in Bulverde, Texas,\n\ninjured his shoulder on the job in 2007. (RR III: 133-134). Ettinger sought\n\nmedical treatment and filed a Worker’s Comp claim. (RR III: 134). Ettinger\n\n\n\n\n5\n Dockray testified that Sulphur Springs was about an hour from Paris, and he recalled\ncommenting to his wife that it took him longer to get to the appointment than it did for the\nexamination. (RR II: 110, 112).\n\n\n                                                12\n\funderwent reconstructive surgery on his shoulder and several weeks of\n\nrehabilitation. (RR III: 135).\n\n      At some point, Ettinger received a letter instructing him to see a doctor that\n\nhe had not previously seen. (RR III: 135). He travelled more than an hour to a\n\nsmall office in Seguin. (RR III: 136). After waiting for about an hour, Ettinger\n\nfinally saw appellant. (RR III: 137). Appellant asked Ettinger a few questions and\n\ntold him a technician would conduct some assessments on his mobility and\n\nstrength. (RR III: 137). Appellant did not conduct any of the assessments. (RR\n\nIII: 137). A technician had Ettinger perform range of motion and strength tests.\n\n(RR III: 138). The physical part of the exam took less than one hour. (RR III:\n\n138). The records of Ettinger’s examination and the corresponding claim forms\n\nsubmitted to TMIC were admitted into evidence as SX36, which reflected that\n\nappellant billed for 16 units of time. (RR III: 204; RR XII: 248).\n\n      On January 23, 2009, Joann Jackson suffered an injury to her knee while\n\nworking as a school crossing guard. (RR II: 49-50). Jackson’s employer filed a\n\nworker’s compensation claim and sent her to a doctor for designated-doctor exams\n\nin March and April. (RR II: 50). Jackson underwent an FCE in which the doctor\n\nraised her leg and bent her knee while she laid on a table. (RR II: 50-51). As part\n\nof the FCE, Jackson also stood beside the examination table, lifted her leg, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fbent her knee. (RR II: 51). She did not get on a treadmill or carry anything for the\n\ndoctor’s evaluation. (RR II: 51).\n\n      Documents contained in State’s exhibit 26 reflected that Jackson’s FCE\n\nlasted four hours, from 12:00 to 4:00 p.m., but Jackson testified that “no way” was\n\nshe there for four hours. (RR II: 52, 54). The exhibit further reflected that Jackson\n\nunderwent various tests, which she wholly denied. (RR II: 52-54). Specifically,\n\nJackson was not asked to stand for over 30 minutes, sit for over 30 minutes, walk\n\nthree miles, push or pull anything, get on a bike or a treadmill, or lift any weights.\n\n(RR II: 52-53). Jackson did not discuss her lifting capacity with the doctor or tell\n\nhim that her capacity was either 42 or 86 pounds. (RR II: 53).\n\nAppellant’s Business and Improper Billing Practices\n\n      Tamara Wells worked for appellant at NTME from 2009 to 2011 doing his\n\naccounts receivable i.e., billing, calling insurance companies regarding submitted\n\nbills, and checking if accounts were paid. (RR IV: 32, 44). Appellant ran NTME,\n\nwhich was a designated doctor scheduling company. (RR IV: 33). Appellant\n\ninitially had approximately 30 doctors working for him as independent contractors.\n\n(RR IV: 34). As part of that employment arrangement, appellant required the\n\ndoctors to give him and NTME a power of attorney and their medical license and\n\nsocial security numbers so that NTME could bill under the doctors’ names along\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fwith the company, sign the doctors’ names to reports, do FCEs, and do the doctors’\n\nscheduling without actually contacting the doctors. (RR IV: 34, 73).\n\n          NTME rented space all over Texas for the DDEs and the FCEs. (RR IV:\n\n61). The rentals were done on an hourly basis, and the maximum time spent on a\n\nrental for a day was between two to three hours. (RR IV: 61). NTME had five\n\nrental facilities at the most on any given day. (RR IV: 62).\n\n          Javier Jimenez worked for NTME as a licensed FCE technician from 2009\n\nto 2011. (RR II: 82, 90). Jimenez recognized State’s exhibits 11 and 13 as articles\n\nof incorporation for NTME and Marconi Physical Performance Testing, LLC,\n\nrespectively. (RR II: 88). Appellant was associated with both companies as\n\nmanager or owner. (RR II: 88). Jimenez testified, based on his conversations with\n\nappellant6, that NTME had difficulty collecting from TMIC so appellant created\n\nMarconi so that TMIC would pay for the FCEs. (RR II: 88-89). If a patient were a\n\nTMIC patient, then Jimenez used Marconi letterhead in conjunction with the FCEs.\n\n(RR II: 89).\n\n          As a technician for NTME, Jimenez performed FCEs, range of motion tests,\n\nand occasionally nerve-conducting tests. (RR II: 90). NTME technicians utilized\n\na one-page form when evaluating each patient. (RR II: 90-91). Appellant\n\ninstructed Jimenez to have the patient answer each question on the form, enter the\n\n6\n    Jimenez identified appellant in court. (RR II: 92-93).\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\finformation into the program, and email the report to the designated doctor and to\n\nNTME. (RR II: 92, 105). The designated doctor for each patient did not direct the\n\nexamination because “that’s what the sheet of paper was for.” (RR II: 104).\n\nAppellant told Jimenez to do an FCE on every patient. (RR II: 100, 105, 106).\n\n      Jimenez conducted FCEs all over the state of Texas for NTME. (RR II: 91).\n\nThe examinations were conducted in rented spaces in chiropractic offices, doctors’\n\noffices, or standard office space. (RR II: 95). The facilities did not have weights,\n\nstationary bikes, treadmills, or any type of exercise equipment. (RR II: 95).\n\nJimenez conducted the FCEs only with “a big object that we used to measure the\n\npushing, pulling, grasping.” (RR II: 94). NTME paid for the rental expenses and\n\nJimenez’s travel expenses. (RR II: 93). NTME also paid Jimenez an incentive of\n\n$25 for each FCE he conducted. (RR II: 94). Jimenez did not know the number of\n\nFCEs he conducted for NTME, but he testified that “whenever we would get a set\n\nof five, that’s how many we would do for the day.” (RR II: 103).\n\n      Jimenez never spent four (4) hours conducting an FCE. (RR II: 94).\n\nJimenez took only 15 to 40 minutes to conduct an FCE, depending on the patient’s\n\ninjury, and approximately 10-15 minutes to input the information into the\n\ncomputer. (RR II: 94, 106). The FCE was done according to NTME’s one-page\n\nprotocol. (RR II: 95). Jimenez recorded the start and stop times for each FCE on\n\nthe one-page protocol. (RR II: 96). Jimenez did not know who put the start and\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fstop times on the FCE Statement of Medical Necessity included in SX30, the\n\nbilling documents for Jimmy Gomez, but it was not the correct time. (RR II: 97).\n\n         Toward the end of Jimenez’s employment with NTME, appellant and Lena\n\nShockley7 told Jimenez not to perform FCEs on TMIC patients because NTME\n\nwasn’t being paid for them. (RR II: 92). Jimenez quit NTME in December of\n\n2011 because he was not being paid. (RR II: 104-105).\n\n         Jose Saldivar worked for NTME from March of 2009 to December of 2011\n\nas a medical technician. (RR III: 140-141, 154). Appellant hired him. (RR III:\n\n141-142). He assisted physicians with range of motion evaluations and girth\n\nmeasurements. (RR III: 141, 144, 147-148). Saldivar was familiar with Marconi\n\nas the company used to bill for the FCEs, but he did not work for that company.\n\n(RR III: 140, 142).\n\n         When asked if he conducted FCEs, Saldivar answered, “Well, what we did is\n\nwe filled out a template” provided by NTME. (RR III: 141). The template was\n\none page. (RR III: 155). Appellant had a standing order that a template would be\n\nfilled out for each NTME patient. (RR III: 143). That template was then\n\nconverted into an FCE, so that an FCE was done on every patient. (RR III: 143-\n\n144). It took Saldivar 10-15 minutes at the least to 30 minutes at the most to fill\n\nout the template, i.e. to do an FCE. (RR III: 143). He knew the time because “we\n\n7\n    Shockley handled accounts receivable for appellant. (RR IV: 65).\n\n\n                                                17\n\fwould just keep an eye on [the clock], because we knew the time we walked into\n\nthat clinic and the time we left.” (RR III: 154). Saldivar never spent 4 hours doing\n\nan FCE. (RR III: 143).\n\n      Saldivar performed FCEs done at the main office of NTME. (RR IV: 35).\n\nApproximately eight patients were seen on a daily basis. (RR IV: 35). The\n\npatients spent “15 minutes at the most” in the examination room actually getting an\n\nFCE. (RR IV: 36). In spite of this, appellant directed Tamara Wells to bill for 16\n\nunits, or 4 hours, for the FCE. (RR IV: 36). Wells had never seen a patient stay\n\nfor 4 hours. (RR IV: 37). All the money from the FCEs went to appellant. (RR\n\nIV: 61).\n\n      Wells knew that appellant’s manner of billing was wrong. (RR IV: 39). She\n\nfelt particularly uncomfortable when the company billed under the doctors’ names,\n\nas she had to copy and paste the doctors’ signatures from their contracts to the\n\nbilling documents. (RR IV: 39). Wells felt that she was forging the W-9s that had\n\nto be sent with the reports. (RR IV: 39-40).\n\n      Appellant hired Lena Shockley to do accounts receivable for NTME in\n\nOctober of 2008. (RR IV: 65). Shockley quit in January of 2012 when NTME had\n\nno doctors or technicians left, her paycheck bounced, and appellant accused her of\n\nimproprieties with money. (RR IV: 66-67, 86). Shockley admitted that she\n\nfabricated facts for appellant when she first met with investigators and the\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fprosecutor in this case. (RR IV: 67). Shockley lied and told the State that she\n\nknew nothing about the FCEs, about how they were done, or how they were billed.\n\n(RR IV: 68-69). Later, Shockley called the prosecutor, admitted that she had been\n\nlying, and now wanted to tell the truth about NTME. (RR IV: 69).\n\n      In truth, Shockley knew that an FCE was being done on every patient. (RR\n\nIV: 69). Per appellant’s orders, Shockley instructed the technicians to conduct an\n\nFCE on every patient except for TMIC patients because in 2009 TMIC wouldn’t\n\npay for the FCEs. (RR IV: 69-70). So, appellant created Marconi Physical\n\nPerformance Testing to trick TMIC into paying for FCEs. (RR IV: 71). Shockley\n\nand appellant created letterhead and revised the FCE to “try to throw Texas Mutual\n\noff[,]” but TMIC still did not pay. (RR IV: 71).\n\n      Wells was also familiar with appellant’s Marconi company, which was\n\ncreated to bill for FCEs. (RR IV: 37). Appellant instructed Wells not to bill TMIC\n\nunder NTME. (RR IV: 38). Appellant wanted all FCEs that were done for TMIC\n\nto be billed under Marconi to see if they could get paid. (RR IV: 37). Wells\n\nbelieved that Marconi was created to “throw off” TMIC. (RR IV: 38-39).\n\n      Appellant had further instructed Shockley to call TMIC to discuss the\n\ndenials with them. (RR IV: 72). Appellant told Shockley what to say, viz: that the\n\ndoctors wanted the FCEs done and that in order to complete a DDE, the FCE was\n\nrequired. (RR IV: 71-72). Shockley spoke with Haden at TMIC about patient\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fJanet Stover and told Haden that Stover had completed all the steps of the FCE.\n\nBut, Shockley was not telling the truth. (RR IV: 73). TMIC said the FCE reports\n\nwere not accurate or truthful. (RR IV: 81).\n\n      Despite learning that NTME could only bill for face-to-face contact on an\n\nFCE, NTME did not change its billing practices. (RR IV: 85-86). Appellant knew\n\nthat the FCEs that were submitted for payment were wrong and included physical\n\ntests that were never done. (RR IV: 87). Shockley even read the rule book\n\nregarding billing with appellant. (RR IV: 86).\n\n      Corroborating testimony from Wells, Shockley confirmed that FCEs were\n\ndone at the NTME main office in Corinth. (RR IV: 74). Shockley actually saw\n\npatients enter the exam room for the FCEs, and she observed that the FCEs lasted\n\n10 minutes at the most. (RR IV: 74). Patients typically spent five to ten minutes\n\nwaiting for the doctor to arrive and do his designated-doctor report before the FCE.\n\n(RR IV: 75). Appellant’s policy regarding FCEs was that one was to be done on\n\neach patient and the FCEs were to be billed at the maximum amount of 16 units\n\n“as if they were there for four hours.” (RR IV: 75). Appellant told Shockley that\n\nthe time spent talking with the patient, preparing the report, and sending out the\n\nreport could be included in the 16 units. (RR IV: 75). But, it never took four hours\n\nto do all those activities. (RR IV: 75-76).\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f      Shockley also testified that NTME paid for the rental of facilities for the\n\nFCEs and DDEs. (RR IV: 76). NTME rented the facilities for two hours at most.\n\n(RR IV: 76). NTME determined the times on the reports for the four-hour window\n\nfor the FCEs based on the time NTME had rented the facility. (RR IV: 76). In\n\nother words, if NTME rented a facility from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., they recorded\n\nthe time on the FCE as “8:00-12:00” since it had to be four hours. (RR IV: 76).\n\nAppellant paid the designated doctors a certain amount for the DDEs, but he did\n\nnot pay them for FCEs. (RR IV: 77).\n\n      Shockley confirmed that appellant created a template for the FCEs. (RR IV:\n\n77). To complete the template for the FCE form, NTME merely copied and pasted\n\na patient’s name onto the form. (RR IV: 77). Shockley completed the FCE forms\n\nafter the FCE, and it took her about ten minutes to do one report. (RR IV: 79).\n\nAppellant trained the technicians and paid them an incentive for doing FCEs. (RR\n\nIV: 77-78).\n\nTMIC’s Investigation into Appellant for Fraud\n\n      Haden began investigating appellant for fraud November 1, 2008, when data\n\nmining revealed suspicious patterns in his billing. (RR III: 56-57). The data\n\nmining showed that NTME always billed 16 units, the maximum allowable\n\namount, for their FCEs. (RR III: 59). Further inquiry also revealed billings for\n\noverlapping times for one doctor, i.e., two patients having FCEs at the same time\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fwhen an FCE was a one-on-one service. (RR III: 60). From reviewing EES-14\n\nforms related to appellant, Haden observed that many designated-doctor\n\nappointments fell within the middle of the time reported for the FCEs. (RR III:\n\n62). Haden also reviewed the FCE reports and found that the reports were virtually\n\nidentical except for the patient’s name, date of injury, personal information and\n\ndiagnosis code. (RR III: 63).\n\nUndercover Investigation of Appellant\n\n       Haden then coordinated an undercover investigation of appellant. (RR III:\n\n63). Bonita Reid8 acted as the patient, and Regina Martinez acted as her sister and\n\naccompanied Reid on her appointments. (RR III: 64-65). G&S Staffing, one of\n\nTMIC’s policyholders, was listed as Reid’s employer. (RR III: 64). Medical bills\n\ngenerated under the investigation were to be submitted directly to the Special\n\nInvestigations Department of the TMIC. (RR III: 67).\n\n       A TMIC adjuster also assisted in the investigation. (RR III: 66). For the\n\nundercover investigation, the adjuster requested a required medical examination on\n\nReid acting as the injured worker. (RR III: 66). Reid had this required medical\n\nexamination with Dr. Boudreau on March 9, 2009. (RR III: 199). Then, Reid had\n\na second appointment for an FCE at a different location. (RR III: 199).\n\n8\n Reid was a Senior Investigator for TMIC’s Claimant Fraud Unit with 19 years’ experience.\n(RR III: 197). Reid had previously been a Dallas police officer, working undercover in vice and\nnarcotics, and an investigator for the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office on death penalty\ncases. (RR III: 198).\n\n                                               22\n\f        William Muhr, a Senior Health Care Fraud Investigator for TMIC,\n\nconducted the second aspect of the undercover operation with Haden, Reid and\n\nMartinez on May 28, 2009, at a facility on Westheimer Road in Houston. (RR III:\n\n66, 177, 181). Muhr had two types of recording devices; he gave a digital\n\nrecording device to Reid and a radio frequency transmitter to Martinez. (RR III:\n\n179, 182). State’s exhibit 8, the recording of Reid’s appointment, was admitted\n\ninto evidence and played for the jury. (RR III: 183).\n\n       Reid arrived for her appointment at 12:58 p.m. and was called in for the\n\nappointment at 1:12 p.m. (RR III: 200). The examination took approximately 18\n\nminutes.9 (RR III: 202). State’s exhibit 31 showed that Reid’s FCE was billed at\n\n16 units, meaning 4 hours. (RR III: 69-70; SX31). On a page entitled “North\n\nTexas Medical Evaluators,” the FCE was reported as occurring from 3:00 p.m. to\n\n7:00 p.m., with the same boilerplate language regarding tests and measurements\n\nthat Haden found in all the reports. (RR III: 70).\n\n       Reid reviewed the billing submitted for her FCE (SX31), and testified that\n\nshe did not arrive at 3 p.m. and leave at 7 p.m. as it reflected. (RR III: 202).\n\nTechnician Jimenez testified that he did not spend from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on\n\nthat FCE for Bonita Reid. (RR II: 99).\n\n\n9\n On the recording, Reid stated “that only took 25 minutes,” verbalizing that she had been at the\nappointment a very short time. (RR III: 202).\n\n\n                                               23\n\fPecuniary Losses\n\n      After this undercover operation, Muhr interviewed Dr. Boudreau and nine\n\ninjured workers as part of his investigation. (RR III: 184-185). Once TMIC\n\ndetermined it had enough evidence, it denied all of NTME’s bills for FCEs. (RR\n\nIII: 113). Muhr also assisted in preparing SX5, the spreadsheet of the billings for\n\nthe FCE patients that were paid by TMIC. (RR III: 185-186). Based on the results\n\nof their investigation, TMIC calculated the fraudulent payments based on either 2\n\nunits of credit or 4 units of credit for time spent with patients on FCEs. (RR III:\n\n115). Based on TMIC’s calculations for the 2 units, or 30 minutes, appellant was\n\noverpaid $71,416.42 in fraudulent amounts. (RR III: 103). Where TMICC gave\n\nappellant credit for spending 4 unit’s time, or one hour, the damage in fraudulent\n\npayments was $61,214.07. (RR III: 104). If TMIC gave appellant no credit for\n\ntime with patients on FCEs, the full 16 units (4 hours) fraudulently billed would\n\nhave amounted to $81,618.75. (RR III: 104) The spreadsheet reflecting these\n\ncalculations for each patient named in the indictment was admitted into evidence.\n\n(SX5; RR III: 100). Haden did not know the actual amount of time spent on FCEs\n\nfor each patient in the indictment. (RR III: 116).\n\nEvidence from Appellant’s Defensive Case-in-Chief\n\n      Appellant presented evidence in his defense. On the State’s cross-\n\nexamination of Shelly Estrada, appellant’s former office manager, Estrada testified\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fthat she billed every one of appellant’s FCEs at 16 units, i.e. the maximum time.\n\n(RR V: 144). Estrada believed that she could bill for time that was not spent face-\n\nto-face with the patient. (RR V: 147-148). Appellant told Estrada that she could\n\ncalculate FCE time outside of the face-to-face contact with the patient. (RR V:\n\n151).\n\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\nState’s Reply to Appellant’s First Point of Error: In his first point of error,\n\nappellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence on three elements of the\n\noffense, to-wit: intent to harm or defraud, deception, and jurisdictional value\n\namount. He also contends that there was a variance between the State’s pleading\n\nand proof. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a\n\nrational jury could have found the elements of securing execution of a document\n\nby deception beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant’s arguments are without merit.\n\n        Intent to defraud or harm, as used in Penal Code §32.46, is a question of fact\n\nto be determined from all the facts and circumstances. Goldstein, 803 S.W.2d at\n\n791. Deception, as alleged in this case, meant creating or confirming by words or\n\nconduct a false impression of law or fact that is likely to affect the judgment of\n\nanother in the transaction, and that the actor does not believe to be true. Penal\n\nCode §§31.01, 32.46(d)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f      The State presented overwhelming evidence that appellant created a false\n\nimpression of fact in his creation and filing of fraudulent FCEs and form 1500s to\n\nobtain payment from TMIC. Appellant directed his employees to conduct an FCE\n\non every patient and to submit bills to TMIC for 16 units’ time (4 hours) for each\n\npatient, regardless of the time actually required to complete the FCE. The\n\nsubmitted 1500 forms also included billings for tests, measurements, and physical\n\nperformances by patients that were not done. Appellant knew that his billing\n\npractices were improper and refused to change. When TMIC began to refuse\n\npayment to appellant’s company NTME based on the fraudulent FCEs and 1500\n\nforms, appellant created a new company, Marconi, in an effort to trick TMIC into\n\nfor paying the fraudulent FCE claims. The State’s evidence further showed that\n\nthe value of TMIC’s pecuniary interest affected by appellant’s deception was\n\n$81,618.75 for the 16 units billed, $71,416.42 if TMIC gave appellant credit for 2\n\nunits, and $61,214.07 if TMIC gave appellant credit for 4 units of time for the\n\nFCEs. Under any scenario, the value of TMIC’s affected pecuniary interest fell\n\nwithin the range for a third degree felony.\n\n      Finally, there was no variance between the State’s pleading and proof at\n\ntrial. The State alleged in the indictment that appellant submitted an HCFA 1500,\n\nbut the documentation admitted into evidence at trial was labelled CMS 1500.\n\nEvidence from multiple witnesses established that the CMS 1500 was the more\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fmodern version of the HCFA 1500, and the name of the form changed when the\n\nHealth Care Finance Administration changed its name to the Center for Medicaid\n\nand Medicare Services. Nevertheless, persons in the industry commonly referred\n\nto the CMS 1500 as the HCFA, and witnesses at trial used the terms\n\ninterchangeably to refer to the same document. Additionally, exhibits admitted at\n\ntrial showed that appellant’s employees referred to the submitted health insurance\n\nclaim form as the HCFA 1500. Thus, the State’s pleading did not vary from its\n\nproof.\n\n         Appellant’s legal insufficiency arguments are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\nState’s Reply to Appellant’s Second Point of Error: Appellant failed to preserve\n\nany alleged error for review, as his argument on appeal does not comport with his\n\nobjection at trial. Additionally, appellant did not object at trial to the timeliness of\n\nthe State’s disclosure of the information that the TMIC funded the Workers’ Comp\n\nFraud Unit of the District Attorney’s Office. Finally, the trial court did not err in\n\nexcluding evidence of that funding, as the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\n\ndetermining that that evidence was not relevant to any issue in this cause, viz:\n\nwhether appellant committed securing execution of a document by deception.\n\nAppellant’s second point of error has no merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\f      STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST POINT OF ERROR\n\n      The evidence was legally sufficient to establish beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that appellant committed securing execution of a\n      document by deception as alleged in the indictment.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an\n\nappellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\nby asking whether any rational trier of fact could have found the appellant guilty of\n\nthe elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. McCain v. State, 22 S.W.3d\n\n497, 503 (Tex.Crim.App. 2000) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307 (1979)).\n\nThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact to\n\nfairly resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw\n\nreasonable inferences from basic to ultimate facts. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at\n\n319. “Each fact need not point directly and independently to the guilt of the\n\nappellant, as long as the cumulative force of all the incriminating circumstances is\n\nsufficient to support the conviction.” Hooper v. State, 214 S.W.3d 9, 13\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 2007).\n\n      While evidence presented at trial may offer conflicting accounts, the\n\nintroduction of conflicting evidence is not enough to render the evidence\n\ninsufficient as a whole. Turro v. State, 867 S.W.2d 43, 47 (Tex.Crim.App. 1993).\n\nIt is within the province of the jury, as fact-finder, to judge the weight and\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fcredibility to be accorded witness testimony, and the appellate court must defer to\n\nthe jury's determination concerning what weight to give contradictory testimonial\n\nevidence. See Cain v. State, 958 S.W.2d 404, 408-09 (Tex.Crim.App. 1997);\n\nBowden v. State, 628 S.W.2d 782, 784 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982). The trier of fact, not\n\nthe appellate court, determines whether to accept or reject any or all of a witness's\n\ntestimony. Adelman v. State, 828 S.W.2d 418, 421 (Tex.Crim.App. 1992); Matson\n\nv. State, 819 S.W.2d 839, 843 (Tex.Crim.App. 1991). The appellate court’s duty is\n\nto determine if both the explicit and implicit findings of the trier of fact are rational\n\nby viewing all of the evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict. Adelman, 828 S.W.2d at 422. In so doing, any inconsistencies in the\n\nevidence are resolved in favor of the verdict. Matson, 819 S.W.2d at 843.\n\n      1. Intent to Defraud or Harm\n\n      Mental states are almost always inferred from acts and words. Hill v. State,\n\n161 S.W.3d 771, 775 (Tex.App. – Beaumont 2005, no pet.), citing Moore v. State,\n\n969 S.W.2d 4, 10 (Tex.Crim.App. 1998). The courts have long recognized that\n\nmental culpability is of such a nature that it generally must be inferred from the\n\ncircumstances under which the prohibited act occurred. Dillon v. State, 574\n\nS.W.2d 92, 94 (Tex.Crim.App. 1978); Russo v. State, 228 S.W.3d 779, 793\n\n(Tex.App. – Austin 2007, pet.ref’d.). A culpable mental state may be inferred by\n\nthe trier of fact from the acts, words, and conduct of the accused. Dues v. State,\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f634 S.W.2d 304, 306 (Tex.Crim.App. 1982); Barnes v. State, 62 S.W.3d 288, 298\n\n(Tex.App. – Austin 2001, pet.ref’d.). Indeed, the Court of Criminal Appeals stated\n\nlong ago that a defendant’s mental state is “concealed within his own mind and can\n\nonly be determined from his words, acts, and conduct.” Moore, 969 S.W.2d at 10\n\n(quoting Norwood v. State, 135 Tex. Crim. 406, 120 S.W.2d 806, 809\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1938). \"Intent to defraud and harm\" as used in Penal Code §32.46\n\nis a question of fact to be determined from all the facts and circumstances.\n\nGoldstein v. State, 803 S.W.2d 771, 791 (Tex.App. – Dallas 1991, pet.ref’d.),\n\nciting Willbur v. State, 729 S.W.2d 359, 361 (Tex.App. – Beaumont 1987, no pet.).\n\n      The State alleged, in relevant part, in the indictment that appellant acted with\n\nintent to defraud and harm the Texas Mutual Insurance Company. (CR 12). The\n\nPenal Code does not define \"defraud.\" In that situation, the appellate courts give\n\nthe word its \"plain meaning unless the statute clearly shows that [it was] used in\n\nsome other sense.\" In re E.P., 185 S.W.3d 908, 910 (Tex. App. - Austin 2006, no\n\npet.). The appellate court looks to the dictionary or other similar sources to\n\ndetermine the word's definition. See Oler v. State, 998 S.W.2d 363, 368 (Tex.\n\nApp. - Dallas 1999, pet.ref'd., untimely filed). According to merriam-\n\nwebster.com/dictionary, “defraud” means to trick or cheat someone or something\n\nin order to get money or use fraud in order to get money from a person, an\n\norganization, etc. See also Margraves v. State, 34 S.W.3d 912, 923\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f(Tex.Crim.App. 2000) (Johnson, J., concurring) (thesaurus gives the synonyms of\n\ndupe, swindle, cheat, or deceive). “Harm” is defined by the Penal Code as\n\n“anything reasonably regarded as loss, disadvantage, or injury, including harm to\n\nanother person in whose welfare the person affected is interested.” V.T.C.A. Penal\n\nCode §1.07(a)(25).\n\n      The State presented substantial evidence from which a rational jury could\n\ninfer beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with the intent to harm and\n\ndefraud the TMIC. Testimony established that appellant directed his employees to\n\nbill for 16 units or 4 hours for each FCE and that he required an FCE on every\n\npatient. Yet, Dr. Boudreau and appellant’s medical technicians all testified that\n\nthey had never conducted an FCE that lasted as long as 4 hours. Testimony from\n\nDockray and Ettinger, two employees injured on their jobs, established that their\n\nFCEs lasted less than one hour each, but both FCEs were billed at 4 hours.\n\nJackson, another patient, confirmed that her FCE did not last 4 hours, even though\n\nappellant submitted paperwork reflecting that it did. The undercover investigation\n\nrevealed that appellant billed for 4 hours for the FCE with Bonita Reid, which in\n\nreality lasted only 18 minutes.\n\n      Additional evidence showed that appellant rented facilities for FCEs for only\n\ntwo to three hours at most, yet he billed for 20 hours of FCEs each day. Appellant\n\ncalculated the 4-hour timeframe on the FCEs based on the time a facility was\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\frented, i.e. if a facility were rented from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. for FCEs, appellant\n\nrecorded the time for an FCE as 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Appellant’s billing documents\n\nalso reflected multiple FCEs being conducted simultaneously, which was not\n\npermissible as billing for an FCE under CPT code 97750 required one-on-one\n\npatient contact.\n\n      Furthermore, evidence showed that appellant knew his billing practices were\n\nwrong, but he refused to change them. Shockley confirmed that appellant knew\n\nthat the FCEs that were submitted for payment were wrong and included physical\n\ntests that were never done. Appellant instructed Shockley to call TMIC regarding\n\nthe denied payments to NTME and told her what to say, viz: that the FCEs were\n\nrequired as part of the DDE. When TMIC refused to pay, appellant created\n\nanother company, Marconi, under which to bill for TMIC patients in an attempt to\n\n“throw off” TMIC and “trick” them into paying, according to appellant’s\n\nemployees.\n\n      From this evidence, the jury could infer appellant acted with intent to\n\ndefraud and/or harm TMIC.\n\n      Appellant contends the evidence is legally insufficient to support the mens\n\nrea element because he presented evidence that he believed he had actually\n\nrendered 16 units of compensable time. Appellant’s argument lacks merit because\n\nany inconsistencies in the evidence are resolved in favor of the verdict. Matson,\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f819 S.W.2d at 843. It was the jury’s responsibility to fairly resolve conflicts in the\n\ntestimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic to\n\nultimate facts. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. at 319. The jury’s determination that\n\nappellant acted with intent to defraud and/or harm TMIC was supported by\n\noverwhelming evidence of appellant’s known and repeated improprieties in his\n\nbilling for FCEs. Therefore, the evidence was legally sufficient.\n\n      2. Deception\n\n      Penal Code §32.46 was intended to proscribe conduct that is deceptive.\n\nMills v. State, 722 S.W.2d 411, 416 (Tex.Crim.App. 1986). Pursuant to\n\n§32.46(d)(1), “deception” has the meaning assigned by V.T.C.A. Penal Code\n\n§31.01. That section provides, in relevant part, that “deception\" means (A)\n\n“creating or confirming by words or conduct a false impression of law or fact that\n\nis likely to affect the judgment of another in the transaction, and that the actor does\n\nnot believe to be true.”\n\n      The State alleged in relevant part in the indictment that appellant, by\n\ndeception, created and confirmed by words and conduct a false impression of fact\n\nby causing an HCFA Form 1500 to be submitted to TMIC for payment of services\n\nunder CPT code 97750 for 16 units of service that were not rendered on multiple\n\npersons listed in the indictment. (CR 12-18). Appellant contends that the State\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\ffailed to establish that TMIC would not have executed the documents at issue but\n\nfor appellant’s actions and that, therefore, the evidence is legally insufficient.\n\n      Testimony from medical billing expert Luevano established that an HCFA\n\n1500, also known as a CMS 1500, was a paper billing form used to bill for\n\nprofessional services. The Form 1500 was prepared by the healthcare provider and\n\nsubmitted to the insurance company for payment. The insurance carrier\n\ndetermined what to pay the healthcare provider based on the information in that\n\nform. FCEs were billed via a Form 1500 under CPT code 97750. Thus, it was the\n\nfiling of that claim form that initiated the payment to the healthcare provider.\n\n      Overwhelming evidence in this case established that appellant created a false\n\nimpression of fact in his creation and filing of fraudulent FCEs and form 1500s to\n\nobtain payment from TMIC. Appellant created a template for the FCEs, and, to\n\ncomplete the template, NTME employees merely copied and pasted a patient’s\n\nname onto the form. The FCEs from appellant included the same language\n\nregarding physical tests and examinations performed during the FCEs, but this\n\ninformation was false, as those tests and examinations were never done. Appellant\n\nbilled all FCEs at 16 units of time, although no single FCE took that much time.\n\nFurthermore, after TMIC discovered appellant’s fraudulent billing practices and\n\nrefused to pay on the FCEs, appellant created a new company called Marconi\n\nPhysical Performance Testing to dupe TMIC into paying for the FCEs.\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f       A person causes the execution of a document if the victim would not have\n\nexecuted that document but for the actions of the defendant. Goldstein, 803\n\nS.W.2d at 7911. The evidence showed that appellant directed his employees to bill\n\n4 hours for each FCE. His employees submitted these bills based on his directive,\n\nand TMIC executed checks based on those bills. Viewing all the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have concluded\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant, by deception, caused TMIC to pay for\n\nnumerous FCEs based on fraudulently created claim forms.\n\n       3. Jurisdictional Amount of Pecuniary Loss\n\n       Appellant next contends that the State failed to present legally sufficient\n\nevidence to support this third degree felony because the State should have\n\nsegregated the value of the properly billed FCEs from the value of the fraudulently\n\nbilled FCE services. Appellant’s brief at p. 13.10\n\n       Under Penal Code §32.46, a person commits an offense if, with intent to\n\ndefraud or harm any person, he, by deception, causes another to execute any\n\ndocument affecting the pecuniary interest of any person. An offense under this\n\nsection is a third degree felony if the value of the pecuniary interest is $20,000 or\n\nmore but less than $100,000. The term \"pecuniary interest\" is not defined by the\n\n\n10\n  This Court rejected this same argument in affirming appellant’s prior conviction in Douglas v.\nState, No. 03-13-00092-CR, delivered August 26, 2015 (memorandum opinion), pp. 11-12.\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fstatute; therefore, courts have defined the term using its common meaning of\n\nhaving a \"financial stake\" in a matter. See Bennett v. Grant, 460 S.W.3d 220, 243\n\n(Tex.App. - Austin 2015, pet. filed), citing Briones v. State, 76 S.W.3d 591, 595\n\n(Tex. App. - Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.); Goldstein, 803 S.W.2d at 791.\n\n      The State submits that it was not required to segregate the false amounts\n\nfrom the amounts that might be deemed legitimate. The evidence showed that\n\nTMIC was defrauded into paying NTME based upon falsified form requests, viz:\n\nthe health insurance claim forms billing for 16 units for FCEs. That a portion of\n\nthat payment may have been legitimate did not render valid the claim for the full\n\n16 units. Thus, each claim submitted on behalf of appellant by NTME contained\n\nfalse information. The State proved that the pecuniary value of the payments made\n\nby TMIC to NTME based on the fraudulent claims for 16 units was $81,618.75.\n\nThus, the evidence was legally sufficient to prove that the value of TMIC’s\n\naffected pecuniary interest was within the range of a third degree felony.\n\n      Nevertheless, TMIC calculated its pecuniary losses based on giving\n\nappellant credit for 2 units of service and 4 units service. Based on 2 units,\n\nappellant was overpaid $71,416.42 in fraudulent amounts, and based on 4 units,\n\nappellant was overpaid $61,214.07 in fraudulent amounts. Thus, even with the\n\nallegedly legitimate amounts segregated from the fraudulent amounts, the value of\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fTMIC’s affected pecuniary interest still fell within the range for a third degree\n\nfelony. Appellant’s claim is wholly without merit.\n\n      4. No Variance Between the Pleading and Proof\n\n      A \"variance\" occurs when there is a discrepancy between the allegations in\n\nthe charging instrument and the proof at trial. Gollihar v. State, 46 S.W.3d 243,\n\n246 (Tex.Crim.App. 2001). In a variance situation, the State has proven the\n\ndefendant guilty of a crime, but has proven its commission in a manner that varies\n\nfrom the allegations in the charging instrument. Id. Appellant contends the\n\nevidence established that the actual form submitted by NTME to TMIC for\n\npayment was a CFS form, not an HCFA 1500 form as pled in the indictment.\n\nAppellant’s brief at p. 22.\n\n      The State addressed this issue at trial. Luevano explained that HCFA was the\n\nacronym for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before it took that\n\nname. The CMS 1500 form was the more modern version of the HCFA 1500; both\n\nwere the paper billing form used nationally by medical providers to bill for their\n\nservices. Luevano used the two terms interchangeably in her testimony.\n\nFurthermore, Haden identified SX30 as an HCFA 1500, even though technically it\n\nwas a CMS 1500 form, as labelled in the bottom right-hand corner. Haden noted\n\nthat the claim form used to be a HCFA Form 1500 but the name of the form\n\nchanged to CMS 1500 when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid took over for\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fthe Health Care Finance Administration. The term HCFA was commonly used in\n\nthe industry to refer to the CMS 1500.\n\n      Significantly, the documents used by NTME in their billing for the FCEs\n\nshowed that NTME in fact referred to the CMS 1500 form as an “HCFA.” State’s\n\nexhibit 29 contained the claim forms and billing documents for the FCE done on\n\nBarbara Boles. Within SX29 is a facsimile cover sheet for a corrected FCE claim.\n\nThis cover sheet, from Tamara Wells, reflected that NTME was submitting a\n\n“corrected HCFA.” (RR 12: 179; SX29). This “corrected HCFA” was in\n\nreference to the original submitted claim form, a CMS 1500. And, in SX36, the\n\nfacsimile cover sheet shows that an “HCFA 1500” in included in the fax, when the\n\ndocument used is actually labelled “CMS 1500.” (RR XII: 225; SX36).\n\n      Finally, the State notes that the claim form bears only the designation\n\n“1500” at the top of the document. Whether called an HCFA 1500 or a CMS\n\n1500, it was the same form, viz, a health insurance claim form. The evidence\n\nshowed that the witnesses considered the forms to be the same thing. Thus, there\n\nwas no variance between the State’s pleading and its proof.\n\n      Appellant’s legal insufficiency claims are without merit, and his first point\n\nof error should be overruled in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f               State’s Reply to Appellant’s Second Point of Error\n\n      Appellant failed to preserve any alleged error for review, as his\n      claim on appeal differs from his trial objection. Alternatively, the\n      trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding irrelevant\n      evidence of TMIC’s funding of the Workers’ Compensation Fraud\n      Unit.\n\nStatement of Facts\n\n      Donna Crosby, one of the prosecutors in this case, testified that she had\n\nworked at the District Attorney’s Office since 1990, the majority of that time in the\n\nPublic Integrity Unit. (RR V: 60). Crosby informed appellant that TMIC provided\n\nsome funding for her division at the DA’s Office. (RR V: 60-61). Crosby testified\n\nthat TMIC paid for the Workers’ Comp Fraud Unit and had done so since its\n\ninception, approximately 14 years ago. (RR V: 61, 68). The Unit consisted of two\n\nattorneys and a paralegal. (RR V: 62). Crosby did not know how much money\n\nTMIC provided. (RR V: 63).\n\n      Crosby had prosecuted Workers’ Comp fraud cases that involved an\n\ninsurance carrier other than TMIC in the past and planned to do so in the future.\n\n(RR V: 64-65). Crosby did not spend 100% of her time prosecuting cases\n\ninvolving TMIC. (RR V: 65). But, when she prosecuted workers’ compensation\n\nfraud cases, TMIC was always an alleged victim. (RR V: 67). Crosby always\n\nprosecuted cases involving TMIC in Travis County. (RR V: 68). She presented\n\nher cases to the Grand Jury. (RR V: 70).\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f      The fact that the unit received funding from TMIC did not affect Crosby’s\n\ndecision on which cases to prosecute or how to handle them. (RR V: 69). In that\n\nregard, the DA’s Office maintained its autonomy. (RR V: 69). Crosby listened to\n\nTMIC’s recommendations and opinions, but the ultimate decision on who to\n\nprosecute remained within her discretion as a prosecutor. (RR V: 69-70).\n\n      Appellant contended Crosby’s testimony should be admissible before the\n\njury because it was relevant and exculpatory as motivation for this lawsuit. (RR V:\n\n71). Crosby contended her testimony was irrelevant, and the trial judge\n\ncommented that it was certainly not exculpatory. (RR V: 71). Appellant vacillated\n\non whether Crosby’s testimony was exculpatory, but he was steadfast in his\n\ncontention that it was relevant. (RR V: 71). The trial judge did not consider the\n\nevidence relevant to whether appellant committed the crime alleged in the\n\nindictment. (RR V: 77-78).\n\n      The trial judge also noted that appellant’s argument suggested that this was a\n\nmalicious prosecution, which would allow the State to rebut that allegation with\n\nproof of appellant’s prior conviction for the same crime with a different company\n\nhe had. (RR V: 80). The trial judge also believed the appellant’s proffered\n\nevidence would be excludable under Tex.R.Evid. 403. (RR V: 81). Therefore, the\n\ntrial judge did not allow appellant to call Crosby as a witness before the jury. (RR\n\nV: 81).\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f      Despite his issue with the relevancy of the proffered testimony, the trial\n\njudge suggested appellant could attempt to present the evidence through another\n\nwitness. (RR V: 81). Ultimately, though, the trial judge ruled that the proffered\n\nevidence of the funding by TMIC of the District Attorney Office’s Workers’ Comp\n\nFraud Unit was not relevant, and, if it were, Rule 403 required its exclusion. (RR\n\nV: 83).\n\nPreservation of Error\n\n      To preserve error for appellate review the complaining party must make a\n\ntimely objection specifying the grounds for the objection if the grounds are not\n\napparent from the context. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1. Additionally, to preserve error,\n\nthe complaining party must obtain an adverse ruling from the trial court, and the\n\nissue on appeal must correspond to the objection made at trial. See\n\nTex.R.App.Proc. 33.1; Wilson v. State, 71 S.W.3d 346, 349 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002).\n\n      In this point of error, appellant contends the trial judge erred in not allowing\n\nhim to present evidence that TMIC funded the Workers’ Comp Fraud Unit of the\n\nDistrict Attorney’s Office. In his brief, appellant argues that American Bar\n\nAssociation ethical standards prohibiting conflicts of interest between the State and\n\nan alleged victim rendered this evidence relevant in this case. But, appellant did\n\nnot make that argument in the trial court. Appellant therefore presents no alleged\n\nerror for review because his argument on appeal differs from his objection in the\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\ftrial court. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1; Rezac v. State, 782 S.W.2d 869 (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n1990) (where the objection at trial differs from the argument on appeal, no error is\n\npresented for appellate review).\n\n      Appellant also complains in his brief of the timeliness of the State’s\n\ndisclosure of the funding by TMIC, but he does not present an appellate issue\n\nregarding it. And, appellant did not object to the timeliness of the disclosure in the\n\ntrial court, so no alleged error is preserved for review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1.\n\nStandard of Review and Application of Law to Fact\n\n      An appellate court reviews the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Green v. State, 934 S.W.2d 92,\n\n101-102 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996), cert.denied, 520 U.S. 1200 (1997). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion when it acts without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples or acts arbitrarily or unreasonably. Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d 372, 380\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1991). “The mere fact that a trial judge may decide a matter\n\nwithin its discretionary authority in a different manner than an appellate judge in a\n\nsimilar circumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion has\n\noccurred.” Rogers v. State, 111 S.W.3d 236, 243 (Tex.App. – Texarkana 2003, no\n\npet.), quoting Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 380.\n\n      Under these guiding principles of law, the trial judge did not abuse his\n\ndiscretion in excluding the evidence that TMIC provided funding for the Workers’\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fComp Fraud Unit. The record reflects that trial judge heard testimony, considered\n\nthe arguments of counsel, and determined that the proffered testimony was not\n\nrelevant to any fact of consequence in this trial, viz: whether appellant committed\n\nthe charged crime.\n\n        Appellant contends the evidence was relevant because the jury could have\n\ninferred that the DA’s Office acted as the “personal attorneys for TMIC” and that\n\n“such a revelation” would have complemented his defensive theory that TMIC was\n\n“strong-arming” appellant because it didn’t want to compensate him for the full 16\n\nunits. Appellant’s brief at p. 36. Appellant’s arguments are without merit, as there\n\nwas no evidence that the prosecutors acted as attorneys for TMIC. Crosby\n\nestablished that she worked for the DA’s Office, not TMIC, that she maintained\n\nher prosecutorial discretion over all TMIC cases and had the final decision on\n\nwhich cases were prosecuted, and that the grand jury indicted these fraud cases. It\n\nwas not a reasonable inference that the prosecutors were the personal attorneys for\n\nTMIC. Additionally, as the trial judge noted, if appellant presented this proffered\n\ntestimony in support of his strong-arming defensive theory, he opened the door to\n\nevidence of his prior conviction for the same type of fraud.11 Finally, the State\n\nnotes that, regardless of the trial court’s ruling excluding his proffered evidence,\n\n\n\n11\n  This Court recently affirmed that conviction. Douglas v. State, No. 03-13-00092-CR, delivered August 26, 2015\n(memorandum opinion).\n\n\n\n                                                      43\n\fappellant argued to the jury that this prosecution was motivated by the relationship\n\nbetween TMIC and the District Attorney’s Office. See (RR VI: 22, 31).\n\n      The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding appellant’s\n\nproffered evidence. Appellant’s second point of error is without merit and should\n\nbe overruled.\n\n\n                                      PRAYER\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the State prays this Court to\n\noverrule the appellant’s points of error and to affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               ROSEMARY LEHMBERG\n                                               District Attorney\n                                               Travis County, Texas\n\n\n                                               /s/ Lisa Stewart\n                                               Lisa Stewart\n                                               Assistant District Attorney\n                                               State Bar No. 06022700\n                                               P.O.

D-1-DC-12-900059\n\nTO THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS:\n\n      Now comes the State of Texas and files its brief in response to that of the\n\nappellant.\n\n\n                         STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n\n      The State indicted appellant for the third-degree-felony of securing\n\nexecution of a document by deception. V.T.C.A. Penal Code §32.46(b)(5). (CR\n\n12-18). Appellant pled not guilty and had a jury trial on guilt/innocence. (RR II:\n\n7, 23). The jury found appellant guilty of securing execution of a document by\n\ndeception as alleged in the indictment. (CR 182; RR VI: 47-48). The trial judge\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fassessed appellant’s punishment at five years confinement in the Texas\n\nDepartment of Criminal Justice – Institutional Division. (CR 194). Appellant\n\ntimely filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law. (CR\n\n202-206). Appellant timely filed notice of appeal. (CR 207). The trial judge\n\ncertified appellant’s right to appeal. (CR 186).\n\n\n           STATEMENT OF FACTS FROM GUILT/INNOCENCE\n\nDesignated-Doctor Examinations (DDEs) and Functional Capacity\nEvaluations (FCEs)\n\n      Dr. Daniel Boudreau was a designated doctor for the State of Texas. (RR II:\n\n60). He explained that a designated doctor was a physician who evaluated injured\n\nworkers and was encouraged to be an independent evaluator. (RR II: 60). Dr.\n\nBoudreau referred to his designated-doctor patients as “claims” as they were\n\nassigned by the Texas Department of Insurance, Division of Workers’ Comp. (RR\n\nII: 60-61). He had no doctor-patient relationship with the claims. (RR II: 61).\n\n      Dr. Boudreau worked with North Texas Medical Evaluators (NTME) in\n\nwhat he thought was an independent contractor capacity. (RR II: 61). He worked\n\nwith NTME from 2007 to 2009. (RR II: 64-65). He gave NTME his medical\n\nlicense number for reports and billing and a signature stamp. (RR II: 69-70, 72-\n\n72). But, he did not recall giving NTME a power of attorney. (RR II: 69-70). Dr.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNTME did not assign patients to Dr. Boudreau, but it assisted him with scheduling\n\npatients and submitting designated-doctor reports. (RR II: 62).\n\n         For designated-doctor appointments, Dr. Boudreau received 60% of the\n\nmoney collected and NTME took 40% for doing the paperwork and collections.\n\n(RR II: 65). Dr. Boudreau received none of the money collected for FCEs. (RR II:\n\n65). Dr. Boudreau generally ordered an FCE where a person had a\n\nmusculoskeletal or limb problem, but he did not order them as a matter of course.\n\n(RR II: 66, 69). He only “might” order an FCE on a person who had already\n\nreturned to work. (RR II: 69). If Dr. Boudreau had an issue with being paid by\n\nNTME, he contacted appellant.1 (RR II: 62).\n\n         The designated-doctor evaluation was completely separate from the FCE.\n\n(RR II: 80). A technician who conducted the FCEs attended the appointments.\n\n(RR II: 67). The technician sent the results of the FCEs to Dr. Boudreau via email.\n\n(RR II: 78). FCEs generally took 30-40 minutes to complete; Dr. Boudreau had\n\nnever known an FCE to take 4 hours. (RR II: 68).\n\n         State’s exhibit 29 contained a letter presumably written by Dr. Boudreau\n\nordering an FCE for Barbara Boles. (RR XII: 266). Dr. Boudreau thought the\n\nsignature on the letter was very similar to his own, but he could not tell at the time\n\nof trial whether the signature was his or made by the signature stamp. (RR II: 71-\n\n1\n    Dr. Boudreau identified appellant in the courtroom. (RR II: 63).\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f72). The letter had Dr. Boudreau’s name at the top, but Dr. Boudreau did not\n\ngenerate that document. (RR II: 72). The letter, dated April 15, 2009, reflected\n\nthat he ordered an FCE on Barbara Boles after doing a designated-doctor exam on\n\n“him.” (RR II: 72). A second page of the document showed that the FCE lasted for\n\n3 ½ hours, but Dr. Boudreau had never seen an FCE last that long. (RR II: 72).\n\n      State’s exhibit 30, medical billing documents for Jimmy Gomez, also\n\ncontained a document with a signature similar to Dr. Boudreau’s, but again he\n\ncould not verify if that were his actual signature or a signature stamp because he\n\ndid not generate that document either. (RR II: 73). The document bore letterhead\n\nfrom “Marconi Physical Performance Testing,” a company which Dr. Boudreau\n\ndid not know existed until recently. (RR II: 79-80). Dr. Boudreau did not work\n\nfor Marconi Physical Performance Testing or recall ever going to their offices.\n\n(RR II: 63-64). State’s exhibit 30 also reflected an FCE lasting from 10:30 a.m. to\n\n2:30 p.m., but Dr. Boudreau did not recall the occurrence of that FCE. (RR II: 73).\n\nDr. Boudreau had no knowledge that FCEs were being billed out at 16 units per\n\npatient. (RR II: 80).\n\n      Martha Luevano managed the Division of Worker’s Compensation, medical\n\nfee dispute resolution, for the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI). (RR III: 10).\n\nThe TDI and the Division of Workers’ Compensation regulated the Texas Mutual\n\n\n\n\n                                          7\n\fInsurance Company (TMIC). (RR III: 16). Luevano testified as an expert in\n\nmedical billing based on her training and experience. (RR III: 12).\n\n       Luevano explained the many acronyms used during this trial and that the\n\nCPT2 code for an FCE was 97750. (RR III: 13-14). “HCFA” was an acronym\n\nused for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before it took on that\n\nname. (RR III: 14). HCFA stood for Health Care Finance Administration before\n\nthe name change, and it typically referred to a paper billing form, the HCFA 1500.\n\n(RR III: 14). The CMS 1500 was also a paper billing form that was used to bill for\n\ncertain professional medical services. (RR III: 15). Luevano used interchangeably\n\nthe terms CMS 1500 and HCFA 1500 in explaining their purpose. (RR III: 15).\n\nTexas Workers’ Compensation used “DDE” for designated-doctor examination,\n\nand it had its own CPT code and rules for billing and reimbursement. (RR III: 15-\n\n16).\n\n       Luevano explained that an FCE was a technical examination that was billed\n\nand paid separately from a DDE. (RR III: 16). With regard to CPT code 97750,\n\nthe AMA CPT code book for 2007 (SX 28) required “one-on-one patient contact, .\n\n. . , physical performance test or measurement, with written report each 15\n\nminutes.” (RR III: 20). The CPT code book for 2008 also required “direct one-on-\n\n\n2\n “CPT” stands for American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology. (RR III:\n14).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fone patient contact, physical performance test or measurement, with report each 15\n\nminutes.” (RR III: 20-21; SX27). The 2009 CPT code book required the same.\n\n(RR III: 21; SX32). The code books for 2006-2009 all required the same direct\n\none-to-one patient contact, face-to-face, where the patient actually performed the\n\nphysical acts of the examination. (RR IV: 7-8).\n\n      On cross-examination, Luevano explained that SX26, the billing\n\ndocumentation or Joann Jackson, was “technically” not an HCFA 1500 but rather\n\nthe more modern version of it, known as the CMS 1500. (RR II: 70-71; RR III:\n\n27-28). Luevano added that Form 1500 was prepared by the healthcare provider\n\nand sent to the insurance carrier. (RR III: 28). Based on that form, the insurance\n\ncarrier determined what payment to make; the form contained a medical diagnosis\n\nvia certain codes. (RR III: 28).\n\n      As for CPT code 97750, Medicare policy dictated that a healthcare provider\n\ncould bill one unit for each 15 minutes spent in direct, one-on-one contact with a\n\npatient. (RR III: 38-39). Any time that a patient was not actively engaged in the\n\nphysical performance examination, tests or measurements was not billable. (RR\n\nIII: 47, 48). Code 97750 required the healthcare provider to prepare a written\n\nreport for a FCE, which differed from the report written by the designated doctor.\n\n(RR III: 39, 40).\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f         Luevano further explained on redirect examination that a healthcare provider\n\ncould not bill for the time spent preparing the written report, reviewing medical\n\nrecords, or travelling to the location for an FCE. (RR III: 41-42, 48; RR IV: 8).\n\nThe maximum allowable units that could be legally billed were 16, which equaled\n\n4 hours, for an FCE. (RR III: 42). Medicare policy allowed for rounding up to\n\none 15-minute increment, viz: eight minutes spent with a patient could be rounded\n\nup to one 15-minute allowable unit. (RR III: 42). The healthcare provider was\n\nresponsible for correctly coding and billing for services. (RR III: 42-43).\n\n         Kathleen Haden, a senior investigator for TMIC, had been the supervisor for\n\nthe Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Unit in February of 2012. (RR III: 53). 3 Haden\n\nidentified SX30 as an HCFA 1500, a health insurance claim form that all doctors\n\nand medical providers used nationally to bill their services. (RR III: 54). State’s\n\nExhibit 30 was designated “1500” at the top of the page, but it reflected “CMS\n\n1500” at the bottom right in small print. Haden noted it used to be HCFA Form\n\n1500, but the name of the form changed to CMS 1500 when the Centers for\n\nMedicaid and Medicare took over for the Health Care Finance Administration.\n\n(RR III: 54). Persons in the business still called the CMS 1500 form by the name\n\nHCFA 1500. (RR III: 54, 127). The term “HCFA” was commonly used within the\n\n\n\n3\n    Haden confirmed that TMIC was located in Austin, Travis County, Texas. (RR III: 54).\n\n\n                                               10\n\findustry. (RR III: 55). The HCFA form would be sent to the TMIC to trigger a\n\npayment of some sort. (RR III: 55).\n\n        Haden explained that TMIC received notice from the TDI when a patient\n\nwas scheduled for a designated-doctor examination. (RR III: 60). The TDI then\n\nchose the doctor and coordinated the date and time of the appointment. (RR III:\n\n60). The TDI notified TMIC of this appointment via an EES-14 form, which\n\nreflected the appointment time and date. (RR III: 60-61). The injured worker was\n\nrequired to show up at that date and time. (RR III: 61).\n\nTestimony from Injured Workers Who Received FCEs\n\n        On July 20, 2007, Jerry Dockray sustained a significant injury to his back,\n\nfour discs in his spine, and his shoulders from a hay-wrapping machine. (RR II:\n\n108-109). Dockray’s employer had Worker’s Compensation insurance with\n\nTMIC, and Dockray filed a claim. (RR II: 109, 114). Almost a year after his\n\ninjury, Dockray had surgery on his neck and then later on his shoulder. (RR II:\n\n109).\n\n        After his surgeries, in February of 2009, Dockray travelled from his home in\n\nParis, Texas, to Sulphur Springs, Texas, for an appointment with a doctor that he\n\nhad not seen before.4 (RR II: 110, 116). The appointment was not in a doctor’s\n\n\n4\n  The doctor was also not from Sulphur Springs and had travelled there for the appointment. (RR\nII: 117).\n\n\n                                              11\n\foffice or a hospital but in a fitness center “or something like that.” (RR II: 110).\n\nThe office space consisted of an office on one side, a waiting room in front, and a\n\nsmall examination room with no equipment. (RR II: 110). The doctor explained\n\nthe purpose of the examination to Dockray, to-wit: to determine the extent of his\n\ninjury. (RR II: 111). Dockray spent only 5-10 minutes with the doctor. (RR II:\n\n113).\n\n        An assistant then had Dockray perform a few tests such as lifting his arm\n\nwithout assistance and sliding his arm up a wall to determine his range of motion.\n\n(RR II: 111, 112). These tests took about 20 minutes, and the doctor did not\n\nobserve Dockray perform these tests. (RR II: 113). Dockray was not asked to lift\n\nanything such as weights or pull anything. (RR II: 112). He did not walk on a\n\nnarrow beam or a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. (RR II: 112). He did not tell\n\nthe medical personnel that he could lift 62 pounds or pull 85 pounds. (RR II: 111,\n\n112). Dockray’s entire appointment lasted only about 45 minutes. (RR II: 112). 5\n\n        Brad Ettinger, owner of a power washing business in Bulverde, Texas,\n\ninjured his shoulder on the job in 2007. (RR III: 133-134). Ettinger sought\n\nmedical treatment and filed a Worker’s Comp claim. (RR III: 134). Ettinger\n\n\n\n\n5\n Dockray testified that Sulphur Springs was about an hour from Paris, and he recalled\ncommenting to his wife that it took him longer to get to the appointment than it did for the\nexamination. (RR II: 110, 112).\n\n\n                                                12\n\funderwent reconstructive surgery on his shoulder and several weeks of\n\nrehabilitation. (RR III: 135).\n\n      At some point, Ettinger received a letter instructing him to see a doctor that\n\nhe had not previously seen. (RR III: 135). He travelled more than an hour to a\n\nsmall office in Seguin. (RR III: 136). After waiting for about an hour, Ettinger\n\nfinally saw appellant. (RR III: 137). Appellant asked Ettinger a few questions and\n\ntold him a technician would conduct some assessments on his mobility and\n\nstrength. (RR III: 137). Appellant did not conduct any of the assessments. (RR\n\nIII: 137). A technician had Ettinger perform range of motion and strength tests.\n\n(RR III: 138). The physical part of the exam took less than one hour. (RR III:\n\n138). The records of Ettinger’s examination and the corresponding claim forms\n\nsubmitted to TMIC were admitted into evidence as SX36, which reflected that\n\nappellant billed for 16 units of time. (RR III: 204; RR XII: 248).\n\n      On January 23, 2009, Joann Jackson suffered an injury to her knee while\n\nworking as a school crossing guard. (RR II: 49-50). Jackson’s employer filed a\n\nworker’s compensation claim and sent her to a doctor for designated-doctor exams\n\nin March and April. (RR II: 50). Jackson underwent an FCE in which the doctor\n\nraised her leg and bent her knee while she laid on a table. (RR II: 50-51). As part\n\nof the FCE, Jackson also stood beside the examination table, lifted her leg, and\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\fbent her knee. (RR II: 51). She did not get on a treadmill or carry anything for the\n\ndoctor’s evaluation. (RR II: 51).\n\n      Documents contained in State’s exhibit 26 reflected that Jackson’s FCE\n\nlasted four hours, from 12:00 to 4:00 p.m., but Jackson testified that “no way” was\n\nshe there for four hours. (RR II: 52, 54). The exhibit further reflected that Jackson\n\nunderwent various tests, which she wholly denied. (RR II: 52-54). Specifically,\n\nJackson was not asked to stand for over 30 minutes, sit for over 30 minutes, walk\n\nthree miles, push or pull anything, get on a bike or a treadmill, or lift any weights.\n\n(RR II: 52-53). Jackson did not discuss her lifting capacity with the doctor or tell\n\nhim that her capacity was either 42 or 86 pounds. (RR II: 53).\n\nAppellant’s Business and Improper Billing Practices\n\n      Tamara Wells worked for appellant at NTME from 2009 to 2011 doing his\n\naccounts receivable i.e., billing, calling insurance companies regarding submitted\n\nbills, and checking if accounts were paid. (RR IV: 32, 44). Appellant ran NTME,\n\nwhich was a designated doctor scheduling company. (RR IV: 33). Appellant\n\ninitially had approximately 30 doctors working for him as independent contractors.\n\n(RR IV: 34). As part of that employment arrangement, appellant required the\n\ndoctors to give him and NTME a power of attorney and their medical license and\n\nsocial security numbers so that NTME could bill under the doctors’ names along\n\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fwith the company, sign the doctors’ names to reports, do FCEs, and do the doctors’\n\nscheduling without actually contacting the doctors. (RR IV: 34, 73).\n\n          NTME rented space all over Texas for the DDEs and the FCEs. (RR IV:\n\n61). The rentals were done on an hourly basis, and the maximum time spent on a\n\nrental for a day was between two to three hours. (RR IV: 61). NTME had five\n\nrental facilities at the most on any given day. (RR IV: 62).\n\n          Javier Jimenez worked for NTME as a licensed FCE technician from 2009\n\nto 2011. (RR II: 82, 90). Jimenez recognized State’s exhibits 11 and 13 as articles\n\nof incorporation for NTME and Marconi Physical Performance Testing, LLC,\n\nrespectively. (RR II: 88). Appellant was associated with both companies as\n\nmanager or owner. (RR II: 88). Jimenez testified, based on his conversations with\n\nappellant6, that NTME had difficulty collecting from TMIC so appellant created\n\nMarconi so that TMIC would pay for the FCEs. (RR II: 88-89). If a patient were a\n\nTMIC patient, then Jimenez used Marconi letterhead in conjunction with the FCEs.\n\n(RR II: 89).\n\n          As a technician for NTME, Jimenez performed FCEs, range of motion tests,\n\nand occasionally nerve-conducting tests. (RR II: 90). NTME technicians utilized\n\na one-page form when evaluating each patient. (RR II: 90-91). Appellant\n\ninstructed Jimenez to have the patient answer each question on the form, enter the\n\n6\n    Jimenez identified appellant in court. (RR II: 92-93).\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\finformation into the program, and email the report to the designated doctor and to\n\nNTME. (RR II: 92, 105). The designated doctor for each patient did not direct the\n\nexamination because “that’s what the sheet of paper was for.” (RR II: 104).\n\nAppellant told Jimenez to do an FCE on every patient. (RR II: 100, 105, 106).\n\n      Jimenez conducted FCEs all over the state of Texas for NTME. (RR II: 91).\n\nThe examinations were conducted in rented spaces in chiropractic offices, doctors’\n\noffices, or standard office space. (RR II: 95). The facilities did not have weights,\n\nstationary bikes, treadmills, or any type of exercise equipment. (RR II: 95).\n\nJimenez conducted the FCEs only with “a big object that we used to measure the\n\npushing, pulling, grasping.” (RR II: 94). NTME paid for the rental expenses and\n\nJimenez’s travel expenses. (RR II: 93). NTME also paid Jimenez an incentive of\n\n$25 for each FCE he conducted. (RR II: 94). Jimenez did not know the number of\n\nFCEs he conducted for NTME, but he testified that “whenever we would get a set\n\nof five, that’s how many we would do for the day.” (RR II: 103).\n\n      Jimenez never spent four (4) hours conducting an FCE. (RR II: 94).\n\nJimenez took only 15 to 40 minutes to conduct an FCE, depending on the patient’s\n\ninjury, and approximately 10-15 minutes to input the information into the\n\ncomputer. (RR II: 94, 106). The FCE was done according to NTME’s one-page\n\nprotocol. (RR II: 95). Jimenez recorded the start and stop times for each FCE on\n\nthe one-page protocol. (RR II: 96). Jimenez did not know who put the start and\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fstop times on the FCE Statement of Medical Necessity included in SX30, the\n\nbilling documents for Jimmy Gomez, but it was not the correct time. (RR II: 97).\n\n         Toward the end of Jimenez’s employment with NTME, appellant and Lena\n\nShockley7 told Jimenez not to perform FCEs on TMIC patients because NTME\n\nwasn’t being paid for them. (RR II: 92). Jimenez quit NTME in December of\n\n2011 because he was not being paid. (RR II: 104-105).\n\n         Jose Saldivar worked for NTME from March of 2009 to December of 2011\n\nas a medical technician. (RR III: 140-141, 154). Appellant hired him. (RR III:\n\n141-142). He assisted physicians with range of motion evaluations and girth\n\nmeasurements. (RR III: 141, 144, 147-148). Saldivar was familiar with Marconi\n\nas the company used to bill for the FCEs, but he did not work for that company.\n\n(RR III: 140, 142).\n\n         When asked if he conducted FCEs, Saldivar answered, “Well, what we did is\n\nwe filled out a template” provided by NTME. (RR III: 141). The template was\n\none page. (RR III: 155). Appellant had a standing order that a template would be\n\nfilled out for each NTME patient. (RR III: 143). That template was then\n\nconverted into an FCE, so that an FCE was done on every patient. (RR III: 143-\n\n144). It took Saldivar 10-15 minutes at the least to 30 minutes at the most to fill\n\nout the template, i.e. to do an FCE. (RR III: 143). He knew the time because “we\n\n7\n    Shockley handled accounts receivable for appellant. (RR IV: 65).\n\n\n                                                17\n\fwould just keep an eye on [the clock], because we knew the time we walked into\n\nthat clinic and the time we left.” (RR III: 154). Saldivar never spent 4 hours doing\n\nan FCE. (RR III: 143).\n\n      Saldivar performed FCEs done at the main office of NTME. (RR IV: 35).\n\nApproximately eight patients were seen on a daily basis. (RR IV: 35). The\n\npatients spent “15 minutes at the most” in the examination room actually getting an\n\nFCE. (RR IV: 36). In spite of this, appellant directed Tamara Wells to bill for 16\n\nunits, or 4 hours, for the FCE. (RR IV: 36). Wells had never seen a patient stay\n\nfor 4 hours. (RR IV: 37). All the money from the FCEs went to appellant. (RR\n\nIV: 61).\n\n      Wells knew that appellant’s manner of billing was wrong. (RR IV: 39). She\n\nfelt particularly uncomfortable when the company billed under the doctors’ names,\n\nas she had to copy and paste the doctors’ signatures from their contracts to the\n\nbilling documents. (RR IV: 39). Wells felt that she was forging the W-9s that had\n\nto be sent with the reports. (RR IV: 39-40).\n\n      Appellant hired Lena Shockley to do accounts receivable for NTME in\n\nOctober of 2008. (RR IV: 65). Shockley quit in January of 2012 when NTME had\n\nno doctors or technicians left, her paycheck bounced, and appellant accused her of\n\nimproprieties with money. (RR IV: 66-67, 86). Shockley admitted that she\n\nfabricated facts for appellant when she first met with investigators and the\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fprosecutor in this case. (RR IV: 67). Shockley lied and told the State that she\n\nknew nothing about the FCEs, about how they were done, or how they were billed.\n\n(RR IV: 68-69). Later, Shockley called the prosecutor, admitted that she had been\n\nlying, and now wanted to tell the truth about NTME. (RR IV: 69).\n\n      In truth, Shockley knew that an FCE was being done on every patient. (RR\n\nIV: 69). Per appellant’s orders, Shockley instructed the technicians to conduct an\n\nFCE on every patient except for TMIC patients because in 2009 TMIC wouldn’t\n\npay for the FCEs. (RR IV: 69-70). So, appellant created Marconi Physical\n\nPerformance Testing to trick TMIC into paying for FCEs. (RR IV: 71). Shockley\n\nand appellant created letterhead and revised the FCE to “try to throw Texas Mutual\n\noff[,]” but TMIC still did not pay. (RR IV: 71).\n\n      Wells was also familiar with appellant’s Marconi company, which was\n\ncreated to bill for FCEs. (RR IV: 37). Appellant instructed Wells not to bill TMIC\n\nunder NTME. (RR IV: 38). Appellant wanted all FCEs that were done for TMIC\n\nto be billed under Marconi to see if they could get paid. (RR IV: 37). Wells\n\nbelieved that Marconi was created to “throw off” TMIC. (RR IV: 38-39).\n\n      Appellant had further instructed Shockley to call TMIC to discuss the\n\ndenials with them. (RR IV: 72). Appellant told Shockley what to say, viz: that the\n\ndoctors wanted the FCEs done and that in order to complete a DDE, the FCE was\n\nrequired. (RR IV: 71-72). Shockley spoke with Haden at TMIC about patient\n\n\n\n                                         19\n\fJanet Stover and told Haden that Stover had completed all the steps of the FCE.\n\nBut, Shockley was not telling the truth. (RR IV: 73). TMIC said the FCE reports\n\nwere not accurate or truthful. (RR IV: 81).\n\n      Despite learning that NTME could only bill for face-to-face contact on an\n\nFCE, NTME did not change its billing practices. (RR IV: 85-86). Appellant knew\n\nthat the FCEs that were submitted for payment were wrong and included physical\n\ntests that were never done. (RR IV: 87). Shockley even read the rule book\n\nregarding billing with appellant. (RR IV: 86).\n\n      Corroborating testimony from Wells, Shockley confirmed that FCEs were\n\ndone at the NTME main office in Corinth. (RR IV: 74). Shockley actually saw\n\npatients enter the exam room for the FCEs, and she observed that the FCEs lasted\n\n10 minutes at the most. (RR IV: 74). Patients typically spent five to ten minutes\n\nwaiting for the doctor to arrive and do his designated-doctor report before the FCE.\n\n(RR IV: 75). Appellant’s policy regarding FCEs was that one was to be done on\n\neach patient and the FCEs were to be billed at the maximum amount of 16 units\n\n“as if they were there for four hours.” (RR IV: 75). Appellant told Shockley that\n\nthe time spent talking with the patient, preparing the report, and sending out the\n\nreport could be included in the 16 units. (RR IV: 75). But, it never took four hours\n\nto do all those activities. (RR IV: 75-76).\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\f      Shockley also testified that NTME paid for the rental of facilities for the\n\nFCEs and DDEs. (RR IV: 76). NTME rented the facilities for two hours at most.\n\n(RR IV: 76). NTME determined the times on the reports for the four-hour window\n\nfor the FCEs based on the time NTME had rented the facility. (RR IV: 76). In\n\nother words, if NTME rented a facility from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., they recorded\n\nthe time on the FCE as “8:00-12:00” since it had to be four hours. (RR IV: 76).\n\nAppellant paid the designated doctors a certain amount for the DDEs, but he did\n\nnot pay them for FCEs. (RR IV: 77).\n\n      Shockley confirmed that appellant created a template for the FCEs. (RR IV:\n\n77). To complete the template for the FCE form, NTME merely copied and pasted\n\na patient’s name onto the form. (RR IV: 77). Shockley completed the FCE forms\n\nafter the FCE, and it took her about ten minutes to do one report. (RR IV: 79).\n\nAppellant trained the technicians and paid them an incentive for doing FCEs. (RR\n\nIV: 77-78).\n\nTMIC’s Investigation into Appellant for Fraud\n\n      Haden began investigating appellant for fraud November 1, 2008, when data\n\nmining revealed suspicious patterns in his billing. (RR III: 56-57). The data\n\nmining showed that NTME always billed 16 units, the maximum allowable\n\namount, for their FCEs. (RR III: 59). Further inquiry also revealed billings for\n\noverlapping times for one doctor, i.e., two patients having FCEs at the same time\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\fwhen an FCE was a one-on-one service. (RR III: 60). From reviewing EES-14\n\nforms related to appellant, Haden observed that many designated-doctor\n\nappointments fell within the middle of the time reported for the FCEs. (RR III:\n\n62). Haden also reviewed the FCE reports and found that the reports were virtually\n\nidentical except for the patient’s name, date of injury, personal information and\n\ndiagnosis code. (RR III: 63).\n\nUndercover Investigation of Appellant\n\n       Haden then coordinated an undercover investigation of appellant. (RR III:\n\n63). Bonita Reid8 acted as the patient, and Regina Martinez acted as her sister and\n\naccompanied Reid on her appointments. (RR III: 64-65). G&S Staffing, one of\n\nTMIC’s policyholders, was listed as Reid’s employer. (RR III: 64). Medical bills\n\ngenerated under the investigation were to be submitted directly to the Special\n\nInvestigations Department of the TMIC. (RR III: 67).\n\n       A TMIC adjuster also assisted in the investigation. (RR III: 66). For the\n\nundercover investigation, the adjuster requested a required medical examination on\n\nReid acting as the injured worker. (RR III: 66). Reid had this required medical\n\nexamination with Dr. Boudreau on March 9, 2009. (RR III: 199). Then, Reid had\n\na second appointment for an FCE at a different location. (RR III: 199).\n\n8\n Reid was a Senior Investigator for TMIC’s Claimant Fraud Unit with 19 years’ experience.\n(RR III: 197). Reid had previously been a Dallas police officer, working undercover in vice and\nnarcotics, and an investigator for the Dallas County District Attorney’s Office on death penalty\ncases. (RR III: 198).\n\n                                               22\n\f        William Muhr, a Senior Health Care Fraud Investigator for TMIC,\n\nconducted the second aspect of the undercover operation with Haden, Reid and\n\nMartinez on May 28, 2009, at a facility on Westheimer Road in Houston. (RR III:\n\n66, 177, 181). Muhr had two types of recording devices; he gave a digital\n\nrecording device to Reid and a radio frequency transmitter to Martinez. (RR III:\n\n179, 182). State’s exhibit 8, the recording of Reid’s appointment, was admitted\n\ninto evidence and played for the jury. (RR III: 183).\n\n       Reid arrived for her appointment at 12:58 p.m. and was called in for the\n\nappointment at 1:12 p.m. (RR III: 200). The examination took approximately 18\n\nminutes.9 (RR III: 202). State’s exhibit 31 showed that Reid’s FCE was billed at\n\n16 units, meaning 4 hours. (RR III: 69-70; SX31). On a page entitled “North\n\nTexas Medical Evaluators,” the FCE was reported as occurring from 3:00 p.m. to\n\n7:00 p.m., with the same boilerplate language regarding tests and measurements\n\nthat Haden found in all the reports. (RR III: 70).\n\n       Reid reviewed the billing submitted for her FCE (SX31), and testified that\n\nshe did not arrive at 3 p.m. and leave at 7 p.m. as it reflected. (RR III: 202).\n\nTechnician Jimenez testified that he did not spend from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on\n\nthat FCE for Bonita Reid. (RR II: 99).\n\n\n9\n On the recording, Reid stated “that only took 25 minutes,” verbalizing that she had been at the\nappointment a very short time. (RR III: 202).\n\n\n                                               23\n\fPecuniary Losses\n\n      After this undercover operation, Muhr interviewed Dr. Boudreau and nine\n\ninjured workers as part of his investigation. (RR III: 184-185). Once TMIC\n\ndetermined it had enough evidence, it denied all of NTME’s bills for FCEs. (RR\n\nIII: 113). Muhr also assisted in preparing SX5, the spreadsheet of the billings for\n\nthe FCE patients that were paid by TMIC. (RR III: 185-186). Based on the results\n\nof their investigation, TMIC calculated the fraudulent payments based on either 2\n\nunits of credit or 4 units of credit for time spent with patients on FCEs. (RR III:\n\n115). Based on TMIC’s calculations for the 2 units, or 30 minutes, appellant was\n\noverpaid $71,416.42 in fraudulent amounts. (RR III: 103). Where TMICC gave\n\nappellant credit for spending 4 unit’s time, or one hour, the damage in fraudulent\n\npayments was $61,214.07. (RR III: 104). If TMIC gave appellant no credit for\n\ntime with patients on FCEs, the full 16 units (4 hours) fraudulently billed would\n\nhave amounted to $81,618.75. (RR III: 104) The spreadsheet reflecting these\n\ncalculations for each patient named in the indictment was admitted into evidence.\n\n(SX5; RR III: 100). Haden did not know the actual amount of time spent on FCEs\n\nfor each patient in the indictment. (RR III: 116).\n\nEvidence from Appellant’s Defensive Case-in-Chief\n\n      Appellant presented evidence in his defense. On the State’s cross-\n\nexamination of Shelly Estrada, appellant’s former office manager, Estrada testified\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\fthat she billed every one of appellant’s FCEs at 16 units, i.e. the maximum time.\n\n(RR V: 144). Estrada believed that she could bill for time that was not spent face-\n\nto-face with the patient. (RR V: 147-148). Appellant told Estrada that she could\n\ncalculate FCE time outside of the face-to-face contact with the patient. (RR V:\n\n151).\n\n\n                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENTS\nState’s Reply to Appellant’s First Point of Error: In his first point of error,\n\nappellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence on three elements of the\n\noffense, to-wit: intent to harm or defraud, deception, and jurisdictional value\n\namount. He also contends that there was a variance between the State’s pleading\n\nand proof. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a\n\nrational jury could have found the elements of securing execution of a document\n\nby deception beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant’s arguments are without merit.\n\n        Intent to defraud or harm, as used in Penal Code §32.46, is a question of fact\n\nto be determined from all the facts and circumstances. Goldstein, 803 S.W.2d at\n\n791. Deception, as alleged in this case, meant creating or confirming by words or\n\nconduct a false impression of law or fact that is likely to affect the judgment of\n\nanother in the transaction, and that the actor does not believe to be true. Penal\n\nCode §§31.01, 32.46(d)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                          25\n\f      The State presented overwhelming evidence that appellant created a false\n\nimpression of fact in his creation and filing of fraudulent FCEs and form 1500s to\n\nobtain payment from TMIC. Appellant directed his employees to conduct an FCE\n\non every patient and to submit bills to TMIC for 16 units’ time (4 hours) for each\n\npatient, regardless of the time actually required to complete the FCE. The\n\nsubmitted 1500 forms also included billings for tests, measurements, and physical\n\nperformances by patients that were not done. Appellant knew that his billing\n\npractices were improper and refused to change. When TMIC began to refuse\n\npayment to appellant’s company NTME based on the fraudulent FCEs and 1500\n\nforms, appellant created a new company, Marconi, in an effort to trick TMIC into\n\nfor paying the fraudulent FCE claims. The State’s evidence further showed that\n\nthe value of TMIC’s pecuniary interest affected by appellant’s deception was\n\n$81,618.75 for the 16 units billed, $71,416.42 if TMIC gave appellant credit for 2\n\nunits, and $61,214.07 if TMIC gave appellant credit for 4 units of time for the\n\nFCEs. Under any scenario, the value of TMIC’s affected pecuniary interest fell\n\nwithin the range for a third degree felony.\n\n      Finally, there was no variance between the State’s pleading and proof at\n\ntrial. The State alleged in the indictment that appellant submitted an HCFA 1500,\n\nbut the documentation admitted into evidence at trial was labelled CMS 1500.\n\nEvidence from multiple witnesses established that the CMS 1500 was the more\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fmodern version of the HCFA 1500, and the name of the form changed when the\n\nHealth Care Finance Administration changed its name to the Center for Medicaid\n\nand Medicare Services. Nevertheless, persons in the industry commonly referred\n\nto the CMS 1500 as the HCFA, and witnesses at trial used the terms\n\ninterchangeably to refer to the same document. Additionally, exhibits admitted at\n\ntrial showed that appellant’s employees referred to the submitted health insurance\n\nclaim form as the HCFA 1500. Thus, the State’s pleading did not vary from its\n\nproof.\n\n         Appellant’s legal insufficiency arguments are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\nState’s Reply to Appellant’s Second Point of Error: Appellant failed to preserve\n\nany alleged error for review, as his argument on appeal does not comport with his\n\nobjection at trial. Additionally, appellant did not object at trial to the timeliness of\n\nthe State’s disclosure of the information that the TMIC funded the Workers’ Comp\n\nFraud Unit of the District Attorney’s Office. Finally, the trial court did not err in\n\nexcluding evidence of that funding, as the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in\n\ndetermining that that evidence was not relevant to any issue in this cause, viz:\n\nwhether appellant committed securing execution of a document by deception.\n\nAppellant’s second point of error has no merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\f      STATE’S REPLY TO APPELLANT’S FIRST POINT OF ERROR\n\n      The evidence was legally sufficient to establish beyond a\n      reasonable doubt that appellant committed securing execution of a\n      document by deception as alleged in the indictment.\n\nStandard of Review\n\n      In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an\n\nappellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\nby asking whether any rational trier of fact could have found the appellant guilty of\n\nthe elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

Penal\n\nCode §1.07(a)(25).\n\n      The State presented substantial evidence from which a rational jury could\n\ninfer beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with the intent to harm and\n\ndefraud the TMIC. Testimony established that appellant directed his employees to\n\nbill for 16 units or 4 hours for each FCE and that he required an FCE on every\n\npatient. Yet, Dr. Boudreau and appellant’s medical technicians all testified that\n\nthey had never conducted an FCE that lasted as long as 4 hours. Testimony from\n\nDockray and Ettinger, two employees injured on their jobs, established that their\n\nFCEs lasted less than one hour each, but both FCEs were billed at 4 hours.\n\nJackson, another patient, confirmed that her FCE did not last 4 hours, even though\n\nappellant submitted paperwork reflecting that it did. The undercover investigation\n\nrevealed that appellant billed for 4 hours for the FCE with Bonita Reid, which in\n\nreality lasted only 18 minutes.\n\n      Additional evidence showed that appellant rented facilities for FCEs for only\n\ntwo to three hours at most, yet he billed for 20 hours of FCEs each day. Appellant\n\ncalculated the 4-hour timeframe on the FCEs based on the time a facility was\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\frented, i.e. if a facility were rented from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. for FCEs, appellant\n\nrecorded the time for an FCE as 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. Appellant’s billing documents\n\nalso reflected multiple FCEs being conducted simultaneously, which was not\n\npermissible as billing for an FCE under CPT code 97750 required one-on-one\n\npatient contact.\n\n      Furthermore, evidence showed that appellant knew his billing practices were\n\nwrong, but he refused to change them. Shockley confirmed that appellant knew\n\nthat the FCEs that were submitted for payment were wrong and included physical\n\ntests that were never done. Appellant instructed Shockley to call TMIC regarding\n\nthe denied payments to NTME and told her what to say, viz: that the FCEs were\n\nrequired as part of the DDE. When TMIC refused to pay, appellant created\n\nanother company, Marconi, under which to bill for TMIC patients in an attempt to\n\n“throw off” TMIC and “trick” them into paying, according to appellant’s\n\nemployees.\n\n      From this evidence, the jury could infer appellant acted with intent to\n\ndefraud and/or harm TMIC.\n\n      Appellant contends the evidence is legally insufficient to support the mens\n\nrea element because he presented evidence that he believed he had actually\n\nrendered 16 units of compensable time. Appellant’s argument lacks merit because\n\nany inconsistencies in the evidence are resolved in favor of the verdict. Matson,\n\n\n\n                                          32\n\f819 S.W.2d at 843.

The jury’s determination that\n\nappellant acted with intent to defraud and/or harm TMIC was supported by\n\noverwhelming evidence of appellant’s known and repeated improprieties in his\n\nbilling for FCEs. Therefore, the evidence was legally sufficient.\n\n      2. Deception\n\n      Penal Code §32.46 was intended to proscribe conduct that is deceptive.\n\nMills v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2362354\"><a href=\"/opinion/2362354/mills-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 416 (Tex.Crim.App. 1986). Pursuant to\n\n§32.46(d)(1), “deception” has the meaning assigned by V.T.C.A. Penal Code\n\n§31.01. That section provides, in relevant part, that “deception\" means (A)\n\n“creating or confirming by words or conduct a false impression of law or fact that\n\nis likely to affect the judgment of another in the transaction, and that the actor does\n\nnot believe to be true.”\n\n      The State alleged in relevant part in the indictment that appellant, by\n\ndeception, created and confirmed by words and conduct a false impression of fact\n\nby causing an HCFA Form 1500 to be submitted to TMIC for payment of services\n\nunder CPT code 97750 for 16 units of service that were not rendered on multiple\n\npersons listed in the indictment. (CR 12-18). Appellant contends that the State\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\ffailed to establish that TMIC would not have executed the documents at issue but\n\nfor appellant’s actions and that, therefore, the evidence is legally insufficient.\n\n      Testimony from medical billing expert Luevano established that an HCFA\n\n1500, also known as a CMS 1500, was a paper billing form used to bill for\n\nprofessional services. The Form 1500 was prepared by the healthcare provider and\n\nsubmitted to the insurance company for payment. The insurance carrier\n\ndetermined what to pay the healthcare provider based on the information in that\n\nform. FCEs were billed via a Form 1500 under CPT code 97750. Thus, it was the\n\nfiling of that claim form that initiated the payment to the healthcare provider.\n\n      Overwhelming evidence in this case established that appellant created a false\n\nimpression of fact in his creation and filing of fraudulent FCEs and form 1500s to\n\nobtain payment from TMIC. Appellant created a template for the FCEs, and, to\n\ncomplete the template, NTME employees merely copied and pasted a patient’s\n\nname onto the form. The FCEs from appellant included the same language\n\nregarding physical tests and examinations performed during the FCEs, but this\n\ninformation was false, as those tests and examinations were never done. Appellant\n\nbilled all FCEs at 16 units of time, although no single FCE took that much time.\n\nFurthermore, after TMIC discovered appellant’s fraudulent billing practices and\n\nrefused to pay on the FCEs, appellant created a new company called Marconi\n\nPhysical Performance Testing to dupe TMIC into paying for the FCEs.\n\n\n\n                                           34\n\f       A person causes the execution of a document if the victim would not have\n\nexecuted that document but for the actions of the defendant. Goldstein, 803\n\nS.W.2d at 7911. The evidence showed that appellant directed his employees to bill\n\n4 hours for each FCE. His employees submitted these bills based on his directive,\n\nand TMIC executed checks based on those bills. Viewing all the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, a rational trier of fact could have concluded\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that appellant, by deception, caused TMIC to pay for\n\nnumerous FCEs based on fraudulently created claim forms.\n\n       3. Jurisdictional Amount of Pecuniary Loss\n\n       Appellant next contends that the State failed to present legally sufficient\n\nevidence to support this third degree felony because the State should have\n\nsegregated the value of the properly billed FCEs from the value of the fraudulently\n\nbilled FCE services. Appellant’s brief at p. 13.10\n\n       Under Penal Code §32.46, a person commits an offense if, with intent to\n\ndefraud or harm any person, he, by deception, causes another to execute any\n\ndocument affecting the pecuniary interest of any person. An offense under this\n\nsection is a third degree felony if the value of the pecuniary interest is $20,000 or\n\nmore but less than $100,000. The term \"pecuniary interest\" is not defined by the\n\n\n10\n  This Court rejected this same argument in affirming appellant’s prior conviction in Douglas v.\nState, No. 03-13-00092-CR, delivered August 26, 2015 (memorandum opinion), pp. 11-12.\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fstatute; therefore, courts have defined the term using its common meaning of\n\nhaving a \"financial stake\" in a matter. See Bennett v. Grant, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243\n\n(Tex.App. - Austin 2015, pet. filed), citing Briones v.

App. - Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.); Goldstein, 803 S.W.2d at 791.\n\n      The State submits that it was not required to segregate the false amounts\n\nfrom the amounts that might be deemed legitimate. The evidence showed that\n\nTMIC was defrauded into paying NTME based upon falsified form requests, viz:\n\nthe health insurance claim forms billing for 16 units for FCEs. That a portion of\n\nthat payment may have been legitimate did not render valid the claim for the full\n\n16 units. Thus, each claim submitted on behalf of appellant by NTME contained\n\nfalse information. The State proved that the pecuniary value of the payments made\n\nby TMIC to NTME based on the fraudulent claims for 16 units was $81,618.75.\n\nThus, the evidence was legally sufficient to prove that the value of TMIC’s\n\naffected pecuniary interest was within the range of a third degree felony.\n\n      Nevertheless, TMIC calculated its pecuniary losses based on giving\n\nappellant credit for 2 units of service and 4 units service. Based on 2 units,\n\nappellant was overpaid $71,416.42 in fraudulent amounts, and based on 4 units,\n\nappellant was overpaid $61,214.07 in fraudulent amounts. Thus, even with the\n\nallegedly legitimate amounts segregated from the fraudulent amounts, the value of\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fTMIC’s affected pecuniary interest still fell within the range for a third degree\n\nfelony. Appellant’s claim is wholly without merit.\n\n      4. No Variance Between the Pleading and Proof\n\n      A \"variance\" occurs when there is a discrepancy between the allegations in\n\nthe charging instrument and the proof at trial. Gollihar v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1560577\"><a href=\"/opinion/1560577/gollihar-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n246 (Tex.Crim.App. 2001). In a variance situation, the State has proven the\n\ndefendant guilty of a crime, but has proven its commission in a manner that varies\n\nfrom the allegations in the charging instrument. Id. Appellant contends the\n\nevidence established that the actual form submitted by NTME to TMIC for\n\npayment was a CFS form, not an HCFA 1500 form as pled in the indictment.\n\nAppellant’s brief at p. 22.\n\n      The State addressed this issue at trial. Luevano explained that HCFA was the\n\nacronym for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before it took that\n\nname. The CMS 1500 form was the more modern version of the HCFA 1500; both\n\nwere the paper billing form used nationally by medical providers to bill for their\n\nservices. Luevano used the two terms interchangeably in her testimony.\n\nFurthermore, Haden identified SX30 as an HCFA 1500, even though technically it\n\nwas a CMS 1500 form, as labelled in the bottom right-hand corner. Haden noted\n\nthat the claim form used to be a HCFA Form 1500 but the name of the form\n\nchanged to CMS 1500 when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid took over for\n\n\n\n                                          37\n\fthe Health Care Finance Administration. The term HCFA was commonly used in\n\nthe industry to refer to the CMS 1500.\n\n      Significantly, the documents used by NTME in their billing for the FCEs\n\nshowed that NTME in fact referred to the CMS 1500 form as an “HCFA.” State’s\n\nexhibit 29 contained the claim forms and billing documents for the FCE done on\n\nBarbara Boles. Within SX29 is a facsimile cover sheet for a corrected FCE claim.\n\nThis cover sheet, from Tamara Wells, reflected that NTME was submitting a\n\n“corrected HCFA.” (RR 12: 179; SX29). This “corrected HCFA” was in\n\nreference to the original submitted claim form, a CMS 1500. And, in SX36, the\n\nfacsimile cover sheet shows that an “HCFA 1500” in included in the fax, when the\n\ndocument used is actually labelled “CMS 1500.” (RR XII: 225; SX36).\n\n      Finally, the State notes that the claim form bears only the designation\n\n“1500” at the top of the document. Whether called an HCFA 1500 or a CMS\n\n1500, it was the same form, viz, a health insurance claim form. The evidence\n\nshowed that the witnesses considered the forms to be the same thing. Thus, there\n\nwas no variance between the State’s pleading and its proof.\n\n      Appellant’s legal insufficiency claims are without merit, and his first point\n\nof error should be overruled in its entirety.\n\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\f               State’s Reply to Appellant’s Second Point of Error\n\n      Appellant failed to preserve any alleged error for review, as his\n      claim on appeal differs from his trial objection. Alternatively, the\n      trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding irrelevant\n      evidence of TMIC’s funding of the Workers’ Compensation Fraud\n      Unit.\n\nStatement of Facts\n\n      Donna Crosby, one of the prosecutors in this case, testified that she had\n\nworked at the District Attorney’s Office since 1990, the majority of that time in the\n\nPublic Integrity Unit. (RR V: 60). Crosby informed appellant that TMIC provided\n\nsome funding for her division at the DA’s Office. (RR V: 60-61). Crosby testified\n\nthat TMIC paid for the Workers’ Comp Fraud Unit and had done so since its\n\ninception, approximately 14 years ago. (RR V: 61, 68). The Unit consisted of two\n\nattorneys and a paralegal. (RR V: 62). Crosby did not know how much money\n\nTMIC provided. (RR V: 63).\n\n      Crosby had prosecuted Workers’ Comp fraud cases that involved an\n\ninsurance carrier other than TMIC in the past and planned to do so in the future.\n\n(RR V: 64-65). Crosby did not spend 100% of her time prosecuting cases\n\ninvolving TMIC. (RR V: 65). But, when she prosecuted workers’ compensation\n\nfraud cases, TMIC was always an alleged victim. (RR V: 67). Crosby always\n\nprosecuted cases involving TMIC in Travis County. (RR V: 68). She presented\n\nher cases to the Grand Jury. (RR V: 70).\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\f      The fact that the unit received funding from TMIC did not affect Crosby’s\n\ndecision on which cases to prosecute or how to handle them. (RR V: 69). In that\n\nregard, the DA’s Office maintained its autonomy. (RR V: 69). Crosby listened to\n\nTMIC’s recommendations and opinions, but the ultimate decision on who to\n\nprosecute remained within her discretion as a prosecutor. (RR V: 69-70).\n\n      Appellant contended Crosby’s testimony should be admissible before the\n\njury because it was relevant and exculpatory as motivation for this lawsuit. (RR V:\n\n71). Crosby contended her testimony was irrelevant, and the trial judge\n\ncommented that it was certainly not exculpatory. (RR V: 71). Appellant vacillated\n\non whether Crosby’s testimony was exculpatory, but he was steadfast in his\n\ncontention that it was relevant. (RR V: 71). The trial judge did not consider the\n\nevidence relevant to whether appellant committed the crime alleged in the\n\nindictment. (RR V: 77-78).\n\n      The trial judge also noted that appellant’s argument suggested that this was a\n\nmalicious prosecution, which would allow the State to rebut that allegation with\n\nproof of appellant’s prior conviction for the same crime with a different company\n\nhe had. (RR V: 80). The trial judge also believed the appellant’s proffered\n\nevidence would be excludable under Tex.R.Evid. 403. (RR V: 81). Therefore, the\n\ntrial judge did not allow appellant to call Crosby as a witness before the jury. (RR\n\nV: 81).\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\f      Despite his issue with the relevancy of the proffered testimony, the trial\n\njudge suggested appellant could attempt to present the evidence through another\n\nwitness. (RR V: 81). Ultimately, though, the trial judge ruled that the proffered\n\nevidence of the funding by TMIC of the District Attorney Office’s Workers’ Comp\n\nFraud Unit was not relevant, and, if it were, Rule 403 required its exclusion. (RR\n\nV: 83).\n\nPreservation of Error\n\n      To preserve error for appellate review the complaining party must make a\n\ntimely objection specifying the grounds for the objection if the grounds are not\n\napparent from the context. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1. Additionally, to preserve error,\n\nthe complaining party must obtain an adverse ruling from the trial court, and the\n\nissue on appeal must correspond to the objection made at trial. See\n\nTex.R.App.Proc. 33.1; Wilson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1662330\"><a href=\"/opinion/1662330/wilson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (Tex.Crim.App. 2002).\n\n      In this point of error, appellant contends the trial judge erred in not allowing\n\nhim to present evidence that TMIC funded the Workers’ Comp Fraud Unit of the\n\nDistrict Attorney’s Office. In his brief, appellant argues that American Bar\n\nAssociation ethical standards prohibiting conflicts of interest between the State and\n\nan alleged victim rendered this evidence relevant in this case. But, appellant did\n\nnot make that argument in the trial court. Appellant therefore presents no alleged\n\nerror for review because his argument on appeal differs from his objection in the\n\n\n\n                                         41\n\ftrial court. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1; Rezac v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1736343\"><a href=\"/opinion/1736343/rezac-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex.Crim.App.\n\n1990) (where the objection at trial differs from the argument on appeal, no error is\n\npresented for appellate review).\n\n      Appellant also complains in his brief of the timeliness of the State’s\n\ndisclosure of the funding by TMIC, but he does not present an appellate issue\n\nregarding it. And, appellant did not object to the timeliness of the disclosure in the\n\ntrial court, so no alleged error is preserved for review. Tex.R.App.Proc. 33.1.\n\nStandard of Review and Application of Law to Fact\n\n      An appellate court reviews the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence under an abuse of discretion standard. Green v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1657475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1657475/green-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n101-102 (Tex.Crim.App. 1996), cert.denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). A trial court\n\nabuses its discretion when it acts without reference to any guiding rules and\n\nprinciples or acts arbitrarily or unreasonably. Montgomery, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2445310\"><a href=\"/opinion/2445310/montgomery-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380\n\n(Tex.Crim.App. 1991). “The mere fact that a trial judge may decide a matter\n\nwithin its discretionary authority in a different manner than an appellate judge in a\n\nsimilar circumstance does not demonstrate that an abuse of discretion has\n\noccurred.” Rogers v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1759137\"><a href=\"/opinion/1759137/rodgers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 243 (Tex.App. – Texarkana 2003, no\n\npet.), quoting Montgomery, 810 S.W.2d at 380.\n\n      Under these guiding principles of law, the trial judge did not abuse his\n\ndiscretion in excluding the evidence that TMIC provided funding for the Workers’\n\n\n\n                                          42\n\fComp Fraud Unit. The record reflects that trial judge heard testimony, considered\n\nthe arguments of counsel, and determined that the proffered testimony was not\n\nrelevant to any fact of consequence in this trial, viz: whether appellant committed\n\nthe charged crime.\n\n        Appellant contends the evidence was relevant because the jury could have\n\ninferred that the DA’s Office acted as the “personal attorneys for TMIC” and that\n\n“such a revelation” would have complemented his defensive theory that TMIC was\n\n“strong-arming” appellant because it didn’t want to compensate him for the full 16\n\nunits. Appellant’s brief at p. 36. Appellant’s arguments are without merit, as there\n\nwas no evidence that the prosecutors acted as attorneys for TMIC. Crosby\n\nestablished that she worked for the DA’s Office, not TMIC, that she maintained\n\nher prosecutorial discretion over all TMIC cases and had the final decision on\n\nwhich cases were prosecuted, and that the grand jury indicted these fraud cases. It\n\nwas not a reasonable inference that the prosecutors were the personal attorneys for\n\nTMIC. Additionally, as the trial judge noted, if appellant presented this proffered\n\ntestimony in support of his strong-arming defensive theory, he opened the door to\n\nevidence of his prior conviction for the same type of fraud.11 Finally, the State\n\nnotes that, regardless of the trial court’s ruling excluding his proffered evidence,\n\n\n\n11\n  This Court recently affirmed that conviction. Douglas v. State, No. 03-13-00092-CR, delivered August 26, 2015\n(memorandum opinion).\n\n\n\n                                                      43\n\fappellant argued to the jury that this prosecution was motivated by the relationship\n\nbetween TMIC and the District Attorney’s Office. See (RR VI: 22, 31).\n\n      The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding appellant’s\n\nproffered evidence. Appellant’s second point of error is without merit and should\n\nbe overruled.\n\n\n                                      PRAYER\n      WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the State prays this Court to\n\noverrule the appellant’s points of error and to affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               ROSEMARY LEHMBERG\n                                               District Attorney\n                                               Travis County, Texas\n\n\n                                               /s/ Lisa Stewart\n                                               Lisa Stewart\n                                               Assistant District Attorney\n                                               State Bar No. 06022700\n                                               P.O.
