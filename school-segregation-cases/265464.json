D.C., 207 F.Supp. 349.

The Court of Appeals, prior to that decision, vacated the judgment of the District Court with instructions to abstain from further proceedings until the Virginia state decision became final (322 F.2d 332)&#8212;a judgment which was stayed by Mr. Justice Brennan on September 30, 1963, 'pending the timely fili g and disposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari.'
