When\r<br>\r<br>          the food was placed before them at the service counter, it became\r<br>\r<br>          apparent that  Alfredo Pascacio, whose native  tongue is Spanish,\r<br>\r<br>          had mistaken  their order.   During the ensuing  exchange between\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis and  Pascacio, defendant-appellee Donna Domina, the \"swing\r<br>\r<br>          manager,\" intervened in behalf of Pascacio, which prompted Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          to say:   \"[Y]ou take care of  the people in front of  you.  He's\r<br>\r<br>          taking  care of me, and we're sorting this out.\"  Domina nonethe-\r<br>\r<br>          less persisted for several more minutes.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Ultimately,  Domina said  to Alexis,  \"I don't  have to\r<br>\r<br>          listen to you.\"   Alexis replied, \"[Y]ou're damn right  you don't\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               1The material facts  in genuine dispute  are related in  the\r<br>          light  most  favorable  to  plaintiffs-appellants,  against  whom\r<br>          summary judgment was entered.

I was not speaking to you.  I was speaking\r<br>\r<br>          to him.\"  Domina then instructed Pascacio:  \"Just put their stuff\r<br>\r<br>          in a  bag and get them out  of here.\"  Turning  to Alexis, Domina\r<br>\r<br>          retorted:   \"You're not eating here.   If you [do] we're going to\r<br>\r<br>          call the cops.\"  Alexis responded:  \"Well you do what you have to\r<br>\r<br>          do  because  we  plan to  eat  here.\"    Notwithstanding Domina's\r<br>\r<br>          instructions, Pascacio placed the  food order on a  service tray,\r<br>\r<br>          without bagging it.   The entire incident at the  service counter\r<br>\r<br>          had lasted approximately ten minutes.  \r<br>\r<br>                    After  the Alexis  family  went into  the dining  area,\r<br>\r<br>          Sherry Topham, a managerial employee, summoned  defendant Michael\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati  into the  restaurant.   Leporati, a  uniformed off-duty\r<br>\r<br>          police sergeant, had  been patrolling on foot outside the restau-\r<br>\r<br>          rant by  prearrangement  with the  Town  of Framingham,  but  had\r<br>\r<br>          witnessed no  part of the earlier exchange among Alexis, Pascacio\r<br>\r<br>          and Domina. \r<br>\r<br>                    Upon entering the restaurant, Leporati  was informed by\r<br>\r<br>          Domina  that Alexis had been  yelling, creating a  \"scene\" and an\r<br>\r<br>          \"unwarranted disturbance\" over a mistaken food order, and direct-\r<br>\r<br>          ing abusive remarks at Pascacio.2   Domina informed Leporati that\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis  had argued loudly with her and another employee; that she\r<br>\r<br>          \"just wasn't stopping\"; and  that Alexis was still in  the dining\r<br>\r<br>          area though Domina  had \"asked  her to leave.\"   Finally,  Domina\r<br>\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               2At summary judgment, we must credit Alexis's statement that\r<br>          she did  not yell or  cause a \"disturbance.\"   See supra  note 1.\r                                                         ___ _____\r<br>          But since it is  uncontradicted, we must also assume  that Domina\r<br>          informed Leporati that Alexis had caused a disturbance.

Alexis  immediately asked why,  denied causing  any\r<br>\r<br>          disturbance,  and claimed a right to finish eating in the restau-\r<br>\r<br>          rant.   When she urged Leporati to ask other restaurant customers\r<br>\r<br>          whether there had been any disturbance, Leporati simply reiterat-\r<br>\r<br>          ed  that the  family would  have to  leave, then returned  to the\r<br>\r<br>          service counter.3  \r<br>\r<br>                    At the service counter, Leporati relayed his  conversa-\r<br>\r<br>          tion with Alexis and  informed Domina that the Alexis  family had\r<br>\r<br>          refused to leave.  In  Leporati's presence, Domina discussed  the\r<br>\r<br>          matter with  Sherry Topham, who  recalled having had  a \"problem\"\r<br>\r<br>          with Alexis on a prior occasion.4   At that point, Domina stated,\r<br>\r<br>          \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should  have her leave.\"\r<br>\r<br>          With that,  Sergeant Leporati returned  to the Alexis  family and\r<br>\r<br>          advised  Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left before\r                   ______      ___\r<br>\r<br>          his backup arrived.

Then, without asking or directing Alexis to get up\r<br>\r<br>          from  the  table, Leporati  suddenly  and  violently grabbed  and\r<br>\r<br>          pulled her bodily from the booth and across the table, handcuffed\r<br>\r<br>          her hands  tightly behind her back, and, with the help of Officer\r<br>\r<br>          Fuer,  dragged her  from  the booth,  bruising  her legs  in  the\r<br>\r<br>          process.

Instead,  they\r<br>\r<br>          hoisted her by her elbows and carried  her from the restaurant to\r<br>\r<br>          the police car,  where Leporati pushed her into  the car with the\r<br>\r<br>          instruction, \"Get your ass in there.\"  \r<br>\r<br>                    As she  was being  removed from the  restaurant, Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          and her husband repeatedly  asked the officers why she  was being\r<br>\r<br>          treated in this manner.  When  Mr. Alexis said, \"We have rights,\"\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati  responded, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut\r<br>\r<br>          up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"\r<br>\r<br>                    Alexis eventually was charged with criminal trespass, a\r<br>\r<br>          misdemeanor  under  Mass. Gen.  Laws Ann.  ch.  266,    120 (West\r<br>\r<br>          1994).  Following  her acquittal by a jury, Alexis and her family\r<br>\r<br>          filed  the present action in the United States District Court for\r<br>\r<br>          the  District of  Massachusetts,  asserting  civil rights  claims\r<br>\r<br>          under 42  U.S.C.    1981, 1983,  &amp; 1985(3), as well  as state law\r<br>\r<br>          claims  for use  of  excessive force,  intentional infliction  of\r<br>\r<br>          emotional  distress, assault, battery,  false imprisonment, mali-\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          7\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          cious prosecution,  and abuse  of  process.

Thus,  Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          raised  a  trialworthy issue  under  section 1981  as  to whether\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati deprived her of \"the full and equal benefit\"  of the law\r<br>\r<br>          accorded white  persons and the right  to \"like punishment  . . .\r<br>                              \r          ____________________\r<br>\r<br>               6The only alternative interpretation advanced by Leporati is\r<br>          that \"there are objective undisputed  facts which are contrary to\r<br>          plaintiffs' premise (i.e. that four black people were not ordered\r<br>          to  leave and were not  arrested).\"  The  undisputed facts flatly\r<br>          contradict a material portion of Leporati's  parenthetical asser-\r<br>          tion, however.  When Leporati first confronted them in the dining\r<br>          area, he ordered the entire Alexis family to leave.

Given  his\r<br>          decision to  arrest only  Alexis, Leporati's retort,  \"You people\r<br>          have  no rights,\" accompanied by the  subsequent threat to arrest\r<br>          Mr. Alexis, remains unexplained by any argumentation presented on\r<br>          appeal.  \r<br>\r<br>                                          13\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          [and] no other.\"  42 U.S.C.   1981(a).7\r<br>\r<br>          B.

First, the crime\r          _____\r<br>\r<br>          for  which she was  arrested    criminal trespass     is a misde-\r<br>\r<br>          meanor.  See Mass. Gen.

I  concur in all  of the court's  holdings\r<br>\r<br>          except the one dismissing the  section 1983 claim against Domina.\r<br>\r<br>          The  evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>          is sufficient, I believe, for a reasonable factfinder to conclude\r<br>\r<br>          that  there  was  a conspiracy  between  Domina  and  Leporati to\r<br>\r<br>          discriminate against the plaintiff, Yvonne Alexis, because of the\r<br>\r<br>          color of her skin.\r<br>\r<br>                                          I.\r                                          I.\r<br>\r<br>                    The facts from which such a conspiracy could rationally\r<br>\r<br>          be inferred are  as follows.   A dispute  over an incorrect  food\r<br>\r<br>          order occurred  at the McDonald's service  counter between plain-\r<br>\r<br>          tiff Yvonne Alexis,  an African American woman, Donna Domina, the\r<br>\r<br>          \"swing manager,\" and the  counterperson, Alfredo Pascacio.  After\r<br>\r<br>          the  dispute was  over, Shirley  Topham, a  McDonald's managerial\r<br>\r<br>          employee, went outside the restaurant for police assistance.  She\r<br>\r<br>          returned  with  Officer  Leporati,  a uniformed  off-duty  police\r<br>\r<br>          officer assigned  to McDonald's pursuant to  an agreement between\r<br>\r<br>          McDonald's and  the Town of Framingham.   Leporati conferred with\r<br>\r<br>          both Topham  and Domina,  who identified  Yvonne Alexis  as \"that\r<br>\r<br>          black woman.\"  Domina told Leporati that she wanted Alexis out of\r<br>\r<br>          the restaurant.   Domina made  this request even  though she  was\r<br>\r<br>          aware  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her family  had  already  taken seats\r<br>\r<br>          preparatory to eating the food they had purchased.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Officer Leporati neither asked Topham and Domina why he\r<br>\r<br>          should make  Alexis leave  the restaurant nor  made inquiries  of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          28\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          anybody else  as to  the behavior of  the Alexis  family.   Based\r<br>\r<br>          solely on his initial discussion with Domina and Topham, Leporati\r<br>\r<br>          proceeded  to the dining room  table where the  Alexis family sat\r<br>\r<br>          quietly  eating their food.   He told Yvonne  Alexis that she and\r<br>\r<br>          her  entire  family had  to leave  the  premises.   Yvonne Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          stated that  they would  not leave  until  they finished  eating.\r<br>\r<br>          Upon  hearing  this, Officer  Leporati left  the dining  area and\r<br>\r<br>          conferred again with Topham and Domina.  He told them that Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          refused to leave.        During  this  second discussion,  Topham\r<br>\r<br>          said she  had a  problem with  this woman  on  a prior  occasion.\r<br>\r<br>          Domina then said, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should\r<br>\r<br>          have  her leave.\"  Neither Domina  nor Officer Leporati requested\r<br>\r<br>          information about the alleged prior problem with Alexis.  Signif-\r<br>\r<br>          icantly,  Officer Leporati again failed  to inquire as  to why he\r<br>\r<br>          was being told to remove Alexis from the restaurant.  Instead, he\r<br>\r<br>          said that \"it wouldn't be pretty\" but he would make Yvonne Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          leave  if Domina wanted  him to.   Domina then told  him that she\r<br>\r<br>          wanted Yvonne Alexis out of the restaurant.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Officer  Leporati  returned  to  the  Alexis  table and\r<br>\r<br>          notified Yvonne Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left\r<br>\r<br>          within  the ten  minutes  it would  take  his backup  cruiser  to\r<br>\r<br>          arrive.  Neither Yvonne nor any member of her family  left.  When\r<br>\r<br>          the cruiser  arrived, Officer  Leporati physically  pulled Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis out of her  seat and over the table  at which she and  her\r<br>\r<br>          family  had been  eating, bruising  her in  the process.   Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis was then handcuffed, pushed into the cruiser, and taken to\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          29\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          jail.\r<br>\r<br>                    Both  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her  husband  protested  the\r<br>\r<br>          violent treatment  she received from Officer  Leporati during her\r<br>\r<br>          removal from the  restaurant.   At one juncture,  Mr. Alexis  ex-\r<br>\r<br>          claimed,  \"We have  rights,\"  to which  Officer Leporati  retort-\r<br>\r<br>          ed,\"You  people have no rights.   You better shut up your [exple-\r<br>\r<br>          tive]  mouth before  I arrest  you too.\"   Officer  Leporati made\r<br>\r<br>          these comments while still inside the restaurant.\r<br>\r<br>                                         II.\r                                         II.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  majority  opinion's cursory  treatment  of Alexis'\r<br>\r<br>          section 1983  claims overlooks several factual  bases for finding\r<br>\r<br>          that there was a conspiracy within section 1983's \"under color of\r<br>\r<br>          law\"  requirement  between Domina  and  Leporati.

And it is clear that Domina knew\r<br>\r<br>          that Leporati would do as she requested.\r<br>\r<br>                    Viewed  in context,  the  events  precipitating  Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis' claims against Domina cast a  long shadow of doubt on the\r<br>\r<br>          majority's  conclusion that  there was  \"no evidence\"  to suggest\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis'  claims  against  Domina  should  have  survived  summary\r<br>\r<br>          judgment.   The facts --  that Leporati consulted  with Domina on\r<br>\r<br>          two occasions; that Leporati based his decision to  arrest Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          on Domina's order; and  that it could be found that both Leporati\r<br>\r<br>          and  Domina took Yvonne Alexis'  race into account  --  certainly\r<br>\r<br>          suggest  something more  than independent,  race neutral,  police\r<br>\r<br>          action.    A factfinder  could reasonably  infer that  Domina and\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati  were acting in concert with one another according to an\r<br>\r<br>          informal  plan  whereby  Leporati  would eject  anyone  from  the\r<br>\r<br>          restaurant identified by Domina as a problem without independent-\r<br>\r<br>          ly investigating the situation.    \r<br>\r<br>                    Evidence  of  such  substituted  judgment  arrangements\r<br>\r<br>          provides a basis  for extending section 1983 liability to private\r<br>\r<br>          actors.

See Lusby,  749 F.2d at\r                                                    ___ _____\r<br>\r<br>          1432.\r<br>\r<br>                    Despite  the majority's  attempts to  do so,  this case\r<br>\r<br>          cannot  be squared  with  the  holding  in Carey  v.

In that case the\r          ______________\r<br>\r<br>          Tenth Circuit found that there was no substituted  judgment where\r<br>\r<br>          a police officer was  called into an airport to arrest a striking\r<br>\r<br>          airline pilot.  The police officer in Carey, however, was more of\r                                                _____\r<br>\r<br>          an  independent actor than the facts show Officer Leporati was in\r<br>\r<br>          this case.   That officer actually  conducted a separate  inquiry\r<br>\r<br>          into the  facts before arresting  the pilot.   823 F.2d  at 1403.\r<br>\r<br>          Officer Leporati  failed to investigate  at all, choosing  to act\r<br>\r<br>          solely at Domina's behest.  Additionally, it is worth noting that\r<br>\r<br>          the  use of  excessive force  and obvious  racial overtones  that\r<br>\r<br>          marked  Officer Leporati's actions in this  case were not present\r<br>\r<br>          in Carey.  \r             _____\r<br>\r<br>                    The  current case  more closely  patterns Wagenmann  v.\r                                                              _____________\r<br>\r<br>          Adams, 829 F.2d 196 (1st Cir. 1987), a case the majority attempts\r          _____\r<br>\r<br>          to distinguish.  In that  case the private actor enjoyed a  close\r<br>\r<br>          relationship  with local  police  officers and  enlisted them  in\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          33\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          carrying out a plan to eject a potential agitator from his  son's\r<br>\r<br>          wedding  ceremony.  We held that a section 1983 conspiracy exist-\r<br>\r<br>          ed, concluding  that the defendant  in that case  was essentially\r<br>\r<br>          using the law  enforcement officials involved to achieve his own,\r<br>\r<br>          unconstitutional ends. 829 F.2d at 211. \r<br>\r<br>                    A  sound evidentiary basis exists for concluding Domina\r<br>\r<br>          and Leporati adhered to a substituted  judgment policy not unlike\r<br>\r<br>          the one  deemed constitutionally violative in  Wagenmann.  First,\r                                                         _________\r<br>\r<br>          the record reveals Domina,  not Leporati, as the impetus  for the\r<br>\r<br>          decision to eject Yvonne  Alexis.  Second,  Domina  and Leporati,\r<br>\r<br>          as individuals who worked  at McDonald's, could be found  to have\r<br>\r<br>          had a  shared  understanding  to  deprive Yvonne  Alexis  of  her\r<br>\r<br>          rights.   See Adickes v. Kress,  398 U.S. 144, 152  (1970).  Lep-\r                    ___ _______    _____\r<br>\r<br>          orati worked the McDonald's detail on numerous occasions and must\r<br>\r<br>          have  had a  working  knowledge of  company  policy and  decision\r<br>\r<br>          making  procedures  for  removals.   Finally,  the  conversations\r<br>\r<br>          Domina  and Leporati  held  regarding Alexis  were sufficient  in\r<br>\r<br>          duration  and  number to  cement  a  conspiracy.   These  factors\r<br>\r<br>          convince me  that the independent police  actions which persuaded\r<br>\r<br>          the  Tenth Circuit that no private liability existed in Carey are\r                                                                  _____\r<br>\r<br>          not present in this case.\r<br>\r<br>                    I am not  dissuaded by the  absence of conclusive  evi-\r<br>\r<br>          dence that an express plan to discriminate existed between Domina\r<br>\r<br>          and Leporati.  The  Supreme Court has found a section 1983 viola-\r<br>\r<br>          tion where there was no formal plan to  discriminate.  In Adickes\r                                                                    _______\r<br>\r<br>          v.  Kress  &amp; Co.,  398 U.S.  144 (1970),  the  Court held  that a\r          ________________\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          34\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          policeman's  presence  in a  segregated  lunch  counter might  be\r<br>\r<br>          enough to infer a  conspiracy between the police officer  and the\r<br>\r<br>          establishment, where the plaintiff  had both been refused service\r<br>\r<br>          and  arrested.  In a notable decision the Seventh Circuit found a\r<br>\r<br>          conspiracy  where the state  agents with  whom the  private actor\r<br>\r<br>          conspired  were  not  actively  involved in  the  deprivation  of\r<br>\r<br>          rights.

It was not necessary that there be evidence of an express\r<br>\r<br>          plan between Domina and Leporati to implicate section 1983.  \r<br>\r<br>                    There was sufficient  evidence from which  a factfinder\r<br>\r<br>          could conclude that Domina and Officer Leporati conspired togeth-\r<br>\r<br>          er to  deprive Yvonne Alexis of  her due process right  not to be\r<br>\r<br>          arrested  without probable  cause and  that such  deprivation was\r<br>\r<br>          based on the color of Alexis' skin.\r<br>\r<br>                    For the  reasons discussed  above, I would  reverse the\r<br>\r<br>          judgment of the district court on the section 1983 claims brought\r<br>\r<br>          against Donna Domina.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          35\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br></pre>\n\n</div>",

When she urged Leporati to ask other restaurant customers\r<br>\r<br>          whether there had been any disturbance, Leporati simply reiterat-\r<br>\r<br>          ed  that the  family would  have to  leave, then returned  to the\r<br>\r<br>          service counter.3  \r<br>\r<br>                    At the service counter, Leporati relayed his  conversa-\r<br>\r<br>          tion with Alexis and  informed Domina that the Alexis  family had\r<br>\r<br>          refused to leave.  In  Leporati's presence, Domina discussed  the\r<br>\r<br>          matter with  Sherry Topham, who  recalled having had  a \"problem\"\r<br>\r<br>          with Alexis on a prior occasion.4   At that point, Domina stated,\r<br>\r<br>          \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should  have her leave.\"\r<br>\r<br>          With that,  Sergeant Leporati returned  to the Alexis  family and\r<br>\r<br>          advised  Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left before\r                   ______      ___\r<br>\r<br>          his backup arrived.

Then, without asking or directing Alexis to get up\r<br>\r<br>          from  the  table, Leporati  suddenly  and  violently grabbed  and\r<br>\r<br>          pulled her bodily from the booth and across the table, handcuffed\r<br>\r<br>          her hands  tightly behind her back, and, with the help of Officer\r<br>\r<br>          Fuer,  dragged her  from  the booth,  bruising  her legs  in  the\r<br>\r<br>          process.  Insisting  that she was \"not  resisting arrest,\" Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          asked the  officers to  allow her  to walk  out.   Instead,  they\r<br>\r<br>          hoisted her by her elbows and carried  her from the restaurant to\r<br>\r<br>          the police car,  where Leporati pushed her into  the car with the\r<br>\r<br>          instruction, \"Get your ass in there.\"  \r<br>\r<br>                    As she  was being  removed from the  restaurant, Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          and her husband repeatedly  asked the officers why she  was being\r<br>\r<br>          treated in this manner.  When  Mr. Alexis said, \"We have rights,\"\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati  responded, \"You people have no rights.  You better shut\r<br>\r<br>          up your [expletive] mouth before I arrest you too.\"\r<br>\r<br>                    Alexis eventually was charged with criminal trespass, a\r<br>\r<br>          misdemeanor  under  Mass. Gen.  Laws Ann.  ch.  266,    120 (West\r<br>\r<br>          1994).  Following  her acquittal by a jury, Alexis and her family\r<br>\r<br>          filed  the present action in the United States District Court for\r<br>\r<br>          the  District of  Massachusetts,  asserting  civil rights  claims\r<br>\r<br>          under 42  U.S.C.    1981, 1983,  &amp; 1985(3), as well  as state law\r<br>\r<br>          claims  for use  of  excessive force,  intentional infliction  of\r<br>\r<br>          emotional  distress, assault, battery,  false imprisonment, mali-\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          7\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          cious prosecution,  and abuse  of  process.

First, the crime\r          _____\r<br>\r<br>          for  which she was  arrested    criminal trespass     is a misde-\r<br>\r<br>          meanor.  See Mass. Gen.

Second, there is no suggestion that Alexis posed a threat\r<br>\r<br>          to the peace or safety of anyone, including Sergeant Leporati and\r<br>\r<br>          Officer Fuer.  Third,  taking her evidence at face  value, Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          neither  threatened nor attempted to evade or resist arrest.

I  concur in all  of the court's  holdings\r<br>\r<br>          except the one dismissing the  section 1983 claim against Domina.\r<br>\r<br>          The  evidence taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs\r<br>\r<br>          is sufficient, I believe, for a reasonable factfinder to conclude\r<br>\r<br>          that  there  was  a conspiracy  between  Domina  and  Leporati to\r<br>\r<br>          discriminate against the plaintiff, Yvonne Alexis, because of the\r<br>\r<br>          color of her skin.\r<br>\r<br>                                          I.\r                                          I.\r<br>\r<br>                    The facts from which such a conspiracy could rationally\r<br>\r<br>          be inferred are  as follows.   A dispute  over an incorrect  food\r<br>\r<br>          order occurred  at the McDonald's service  counter between plain-\r<br>\r<br>          tiff Yvonne Alexis,  an African American woman, Donna Domina, the\r<br>\r<br>          \"swing manager,\" and the  counterperson, Alfredo Pascacio.  After\r<br>\r<br>          the  dispute was  over, Shirley  Topham, a  McDonald's managerial\r<br>\r<br>          employee, went outside the restaurant for police assistance.  She\r<br>\r<br>          returned  with  Officer  Leporati,  a uniformed  off-duty  police\r<br>\r<br>          officer assigned  to McDonald's pursuant to  an agreement between\r<br>\r<br>          McDonald's and  the Town of Framingham.   Leporati conferred with\r<br>\r<br>          both Topham  and Domina,  who identified  Yvonne Alexis  as \"that\r<br>\r<br>          black woman.\"  Domina told Leporati that she wanted Alexis out of\r<br>\r<br>          the restaurant.   Domina made  this request even  though she  was\r<br>\r<br>          aware  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her family  had  already  taken seats\r<br>\r<br>          preparatory to eating the food they had purchased.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Officer Leporati neither asked Topham and Domina why he\r<br>\r<br>          should make  Alexis leave  the restaurant nor  made inquiries  of\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          28\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          anybody else  as to  the behavior of  the Alexis  family.   Based\r<br>\r<br>          solely on his initial discussion with Domina and Topham, Leporati\r<br>\r<br>          proceeded  to the dining room  table where the  Alexis family sat\r<br>\r<br>          quietly  eating their food.   He told Yvonne  Alexis that she and\r<br>\r<br>          her  entire  family had  to leave  the  premises.   Yvonne Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          stated that  they would  not leave  until  they finished  eating.\r<br>\r<br>          Upon  hearing  this, Officer  Leporati left  the dining  area and\r<br>\r<br>          conferred again with Topham and Domina.  He told them that Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          refused to leave.        During  this  second discussion,  Topham\r<br>\r<br>          said she  had a  problem with  this woman  on  a prior  occasion.\r<br>\r<br>          Domina then said, \"Well, if that's the case, then maybe we should\r<br>\r<br>          have  her leave.\"  Neither Domina  nor Officer Leporati requested\r<br>\r<br>          information about the alleged prior problem with Alexis.  Signif-\r<br>\r<br>          icantly,  Officer Leporati again failed  to inquire as  to why he\r<br>\r<br>          was being told to remove Alexis from the restaurant.  Instead, he\r<br>\r<br>          said that \"it wouldn't be pretty\" but he would make Yvonne Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          leave  if Domina wanted  him to.   Domina then told  him that she\r<br>\r<br>          wanted Yvonne Alexis out of the restaurant.  \r<br>\r<br>                    Officer  Leporati  returned  to  the  Alexis  table and\r<br>\r<br>          notified Yvonne Alexis that she would be arrested unless she left\r<br>\r<br>          within  the ten  minutes  it would  take  his backup  cruiser  to\r<br>\r<br>          arrive.  Neither Yvonne nor any member of her family  left.  When\r<br>\r<br>          the cruiser  arrived, Officer  Leporati physically  pulled Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis out of her  seat and over the table  at which she and  her\r<br>\r<br>          family  had been  eating, bruising  her in  the process.   Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis was then handcuffed, pushed into the cruiser, and taken to\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          29\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          jail.\r<br>\r<br>                    Both  Yvonne  Alexis  and  her  husband  protested  the\r<br>\r<br>          violent treatment  she received from Officer  Leporati during her\r<br>\r<br>          removal from the  restaurant.   At one juncture,  Mr. Alexis  ex-\r<br>\r<br>          claimed,  \"We have  rights,\"  to which  Officer Leporati  retort-\r<br>\r<br>          ed,\"You  people have no rights.   You better shut up your [exple-\r<br>\r<br>          tive]  mouth before  I arrest  you too.\"   Officer  Leporati made\r<br>\r<br>          these comments while still inside the restaurant.\r<br>\r<br>                                         II.\r                                         II.\r<br>\r<br>                    The  majority  opinion's cursory  treatment  of Alexis'\r<br>\r<br>          section 1983  claims overlooks several factual  bases for finding\r<br>\r<br>          that there was a conspiracy within section 1983's \"under color of\r<br>\r<br>          law\"  requirement  between Domina  and  Leporati.

But, I\r<br>\r<br>          am  persuaded by the fact  that Domina and  Leporati conferred on\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>                                          31\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>          two separate occasions before Alexis' brutal arrest.  The  record\r<br>\r<br>          establishes that Domina, not Leporati, made the decision to expel\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis from McDonald's premises, and that she made  that decision\r<br>\r<br>          with the knowledge  that some harm  could befall Alexis  (Alexis'\r<br>\r<br>          removal \"would not be pretty\").  And it is clear that Domina knew\r<br>\r<br>          that Leporati would do as she requested.\r<br>\r<br>                    Viewed  in context,  the  events  precipitating  Yvonne\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis' claims against Domina cast a  long shadow of doubt on the\r<br>\r<br>          majority's  conclusion that  there was  \"no evidence\"  to suggest\r<br>\r<br>          Alexis'  claims  against  Domina  should  have  survived  summary\r<br>\r<br>          judgment.   The facts --  that Leporati consulted  with Domina on\r<br>\r<br>          two occasions; that Leporati based his decision to  arrest Alexis\r<br>\r<br>          on Domina's order; and  that it could be found that both Leporati\r<br>\r<br>          and  Domina took Yvonne Alexis'  race into account  --  certainly\r<br>\r<br>          suggest  something more  than independent,  race neutral,  police\r<br>\r<br>          action.    A factfinder  could reasonably  infer that  Domina and\r<br>\r<br>          Leporati  were acting in concert with one another according to an\r<br>\r<br>          informal  plan  whereby  Leporati  would eject  anyone  from  the\r<br>\r<br>          restaurant identified by Domina as a problem without independent-\r<br>\r<br>          ly investigating the situation.    \r<br>\r<br>                    Evidence  of  such  substituted  judgment  arrangements\r<br>\r<br>          provides a basis  for extending section 1983 liability to private\r<br>\r<br>          actors.

Finally,  the  conversations\r<br>\r<br>          Domina  and Leporati  held  regarding Alexis  were sufficient  in\r<br>\r<br>          duration  and  number to  cement  a  conspiracy.   These  factors\r<br>\r<br>          convince me  that the independent police  actions which persuaded\r<br>\r<br>          the  Tenth Circuit that no private liability existed in Carey are\r                                                                  _____\r<br>\r<br>          not present in this case.\r<br>\r<br>                    I am not  dissuaded by the  absence of conclusive  evi-\r<br>\r<br>          dence that an express plan to discriminate existed between Domina\r<br>\r<br>          and Leporati.
