New York.</b></p></center>\n<center>March 20, 2008.</center>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>DECISION and ORDER</i></h2>\n<p>THOMAS J. McAVOY, Senior District Judge.</p>\n<p>This matter brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was referred to the Hon. George H. Lowe, United States Magistrate Judge, for a Report-Recommendation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rule 72.3(c).</p>\n<p>The Report-Recommendation dated January 8, 2008 recommended that the Defendant's motion for summary judgment be granted and Plaintiffs complaint dismissed in its entirety with prejudice. Plaintiff filed objections to the Report-Recommendation, essentially raising the same arguments presented to the Magistrate Judge.</p>\n<p>When objections to a magistrate judge's Report-Recommendation are lodged, the Court makes a <i>\"de novo</i> determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.\" See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1). After such a review, the Court may \"accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge. The judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Having reviewed the record <i>de novo</i> and having considered the issues raised in Plaintiffs objections, this Court adopt the recommendation of Magistrate Judge Lowe for the reasons stated therein. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED and Plaintiffs Complaint is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p>IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>REPORT-RECOMMENDATION</i></h2>\n<p>GEORGE H. LOWE, United States Magistrate Judge.</p>\n<p>This prisoner civil rights action, commenced <i>pro se</i> by Mr. Constantinee L. Jackson (\"Plaintiff) pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, has been referred to me for Report and Recommendation by the Honorable Thomas J. McAvoy, Senior United States District Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rule 72.3(c). Liberally construed, Plaintiffs Complaint alleges that, in February and March of 2004, two employees of the Onondaga County Jail  Chief Custody Deputy Anthony Callisto, Jr., and Deputy Cheryl Spina (\"Defendants\")  violated Plaintiffs rights under the First, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments when (1) Defendant Spina filed a false disciplinary report charging Plaintiff with assault, in retaliation for Plaintiffs having embarrassed her by calling her \"ugly,\" causing Plaintiff to be convicted of that charge and illegally confined to the Special Housing Unit at the Onondaga County Jail for a period of forty-nine days without life's basic necessities, and (2) Defendant Callisto failed to prevent either the duration or conditions of that incarceration. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].)</p>\n<p>Currently pending before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. (Dkt. No. 52.) Generally, Defendants' motion is premised on the following alternative grounds: (1) Plaintiffs failure to allege facts plausibly suggesting any constitutional violations; (2) Plaintiffs failure to adduce evidence establishing any constitutional violations; (3) the principles of limited municipal liability established by <i>Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and its progeny; (4) the doctrine of collateral estoppel; and/or (5) the doctrine of qualified immunity. (See <i>generally</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 10 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) For the reasons that follow, I recommend that Defendants' motion be granted, and that Plaintiffs Complaint be dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD</h2>\n<p>Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is warranted if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In determining whether a genuine issue of material<sup>[1]</sup> fact exists, the Court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>However, when the moving party has met its initial burden of establishing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party must come forward with \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"<sup>[3]</sup> The nonmoving party must do more than \"rest upon the mere allegations ... of the [plaintiffs] pleading\" or \"simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Rather, \"[a] dispute regarding a material fact is <i>genuine</i> if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Where a non-movant fails to adequately oppose a properly supported factual assertion made in a motion for summary judgment, a district court has no duty to perform an independent review of the record to find proof of a factual dispute,<sup>[6]</sup> even if that non-movant is proceeding <i>pro se.</i><sup>[7]</sup> In the event the district court chooses to conduct such an independent review of the record, any verified complaint filed by the plaintiff should be treated as an affidavit.<sup>[8]</sup> (Here, I note that Plaintiffs' Complaint contains a verification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 174<sup>[9]</sup>) In any event, to be sufficient to create a factual issue for purposes of a summary judgment motion, an affidavit must, among other things, not be conclusory.<sup>[10]</sup>\" An affidavit is conclusory if, for example, its assertions lack any supporting evidence or are too general.<sup>[11]</sup> Finally, even where an affidavit (or verified complaint) is nonconclusory, it may be insufficient to create a factual issue where it is (1) \"largely unsubstantiated by any other direct evidence\" and (2) \"so replete with inconsistencies and improbabilities that no reasonable juror would undertake the suspension of disbelief necessary to credit the allegations made in the complaint.\"<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Under Rule 12(b)(6)</h2>\n<p>To the extent that a defendant's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is based entirely on the plaintiffs complaint,<sup>[13]</sup> such a motion is functionally the same as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). As a result, \"[w]here appropriate, a trial judge may dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Schwartz v. Compagnie General Transatlantique,</i> 405 F.2d 270, 273-74 (2d Cir.1968) [citations omitted], <i>accord, </i><i>Katz v. Molic,</i> 128 F.R.D. 35, 37-38 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (\"This Court finds that ... a conversion [of a Rule 56 summary judgment motion to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint] is proper with or without notice to the parties.\").</p>\n<p>Moreover, even where a defendant has not advanced such a failure-to-state-a-claim argument on a motion for summary judgment, a district court may, <i>sua sponte,</i> address whether a <i>pro se</i> prisoner has failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>For these reasons, it is appropriate to briefly summarize the legal standard governing Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss. Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). It has long been understood that a defendant may base such a motion on either or both of two grounds: (1) a challenge to the \"sufficiency of the pleading\" under Rule 8(a)(2);<sup>[15]</sup> or (2) a challenge to the legal cognizability of the claim.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Such a statement must \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"<sup>[17]</sup> The purpose of this rule is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\"<sup>[18]</sup> A complaint that fails to comply with this rule \"presents far too a heavy burden in terms of defendants' duty to shape a comprehensive defense and provides no meaningful basis for the Court to assess the sufficiency of [plaintiffs] claims.\"<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has long characterized this pleading requirement under Rule 8(a)(2) as \"simplified\" and \"liberal,\" and has repeatedly rejected judicially established pleading requirements that exceed this liberal requirement.<sup>[20]</sup> However, it is well established that even this liberal notice pleading standard \"has its limits.\"<sup>[21]</sup> As a result, several Supreme Court and Second Circuit decisions exist, holding that a pleading has failed to meet this liberal notice pleading standard.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Most notably, in the recent decision of <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> the Supreme Court, in reversing an appellate decision holding that a complaint had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted, \"retire[d]\" the famous statement by the Court in <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), that \"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1968-69, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).<sup>[23]</sup> Rather than turning on the <i>conceivability</i> of an actionable claim, the Court clarified, the Rule 8 standard turns on the \"plausibility\" of an actionable claim. <i>Id.</i> at 1965-74. More specifically, the Court held that, for a plaintiffs complaint to state a claim, his \"[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level [to a plausible level]\" assuming, of course, that all the allegations in the complaint are true. <i>Id.</i> at 1965 [citations omitted]. What this means, on a practical level, is that there must be \"plausible grounds to infer [actionable conduct],\" or, in other words, \"enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [actionable conduct].\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Iqbal v. Hasty,</i> 490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir.2007) (\"[W]e believe the [Supreme] Court [in <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly</i>] is ... requiring a flexible `plausibility standard,' which obliges a pleader to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those contexts where such amplification is needed to render the claim <i>plausible.\"</i>) [emphasis in original].</p>\n<p>Having said that, it should be emphasized that, \"[i]n reviewing a complaint for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the court must accept the material facts alleged in the complaint as true and construe all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\"<sup>[24]</sup> Moreover, it should be noted that \"[t]his standard is applied with even greater force where the plaintiff alleges civil rights violations or where the complaint is submitted <i>pro se.\"</i><sup>[25]</sup> In other words, while all pleadings are to be construed liberally, <i>pro se</i> civil rights pleadings are generally to be construed with an <i>extra</i> degree of liberality. Indeed, generally \"courts must construe <i>pro se</i> pleadings broadly, and interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.\"<sup>[26]</sup> In addition, when addressing a <i>pro se</i> complaint, generally a district court \"should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.\"<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>However, when a plaintiff is proceeding <i>pro se,</i> \"all normal rules of pleading are not absolutely suspended.\"<sup>[28]</sup> For example, an opportunity to amend should be denied where \"the problem with [plaintiffs] causes of action is substantive\" such that \"[b]etter pleading will not cure it.\"<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Failure to State a Claim</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. First Amendment</h2>\n<p>Claims of retaliation like those asserted by Plaintiff find their roots in the First Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Gill v. Pidlypchak,</i> 389 F.3d 379, 380-81 (2d Cir.2004). Central to such claims is the notion that in a prison setting, corrections officials may not take actions which would have a chilling effect upon an inmate's exercise of First Amendment rights. <i>See </i><i>Gill,</i> 389 F.3d at 381-383. Because of the relative ease with which claims of retaliation can be incanted, however, courts have scrutinized such retaliation claims with particular care. <i>See </i><i>Flaherty v. Coughlin,</i> 713 F.2d 10, 13 (2d Cir.1983). As the Second Circuit has noted,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]his is true for several reasons. First, claims of retaliation are difficult to dispose of on the pleadings because they involve questions of intent and are therefore easily fabricated. Second, prisoners' claims of retaliation pose a substantial risk of unwarranted judicial intrusion into matters of general prison administration. This is so because virtually any adverse action taken against a prisoner by a prison official  even those otherwise not rising to the level of a constitutional violation  can be characterized as a constitutionally proscribed retaliatory act.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Dawes v. Walker,</i> 239 F.3d 489, 491 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted), <i>overruled on other grounds, </i><i>Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N.A.,</i> 534 U.S. 506, 122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002).</p>\n<p>To prove a First Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a Plaintiff must establish' the following: (1) that the speech or conduct at issue was \"protected\"; (2) that the defendants took \"adverse action\" against the plaintiff  namely, action that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her constitutional rights; and (3) that there was a causal connection between the protected speech and the adverse action  in other words, that the protected conduct was a \"substantial or motivating factor\" in the defendants' decision to take action against the plaintiff. <i>Mount Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977); <i>Gill,</i> 389 F.3d at 380 (citing <i>Daives v. Walker,</i> 239 F.3d 489, 492 [(2d Cir.2001)]). Under this analysis, adverse action taken for both proper and improper reasons may be upheld if the action would have been taken based on the proper reasons alone. <i>Graham v. Henderson.</i> 89 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.1996) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p>Here, the speech or conduct that Plaintiff alleges he was engaging in when Defendant Spina retaliated against him consisted of Plaintiff stating to Defendant Spina, \"My attorney Ralph Habib said stop asking about him. He said your [sic] ugle [sic].\" (Dkt. No. 1, ¶ II.D. [Plf.'s Compl.].) I know of no case law that would support a conclusion that such speech or conduct <i>against a prison guard</i> is protected by the First Amendment.<sup>[30]</sup> Indeed, the instructive cases that I have found are quite to the contrary. For example, in <i>Brooks v. Miles,</i> the Southern District held</p>\n<blockquote>The uncontroverted evidence in this case, including Brooks' own admissions, makes clear that Brooks' profane language, and confrontational speech and conduct [against correctional staff] placed him in violation of valid prison regulations  thus placing his speech and conduct outside the protection of the First Amendment, and providing defendants with legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for disciplining him.... Brooks does not argue, nor could he, that he has a First Amendment right, as a prisoner, to use obscene, disrespectful language in addressing correctional staff ....</blockquote>\n<p><i>Brooks v. Miles,</i> 98-CV-5763, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10677, at *16-17, 19 (S.D.N.Y. May 10, 2001), <i>adopted,</i> 210 F.Supp.2d 290 (S.D.N.Y.2001).<sup>[31]</sup></p>\n<p>Even if Plaintiff had alleged facts plausibly suggesting that he had engaged in speech or conduct that was protected by the First Amendment, he has alleged no facts plausibly suggesting that Defendant Callisto took, or was personally involved in, any <i>adverse action</i> against him. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].)</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs First Amendment claim against Defendants for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, because I find that the defects in his First Amendment claim are substantive rather than merely formal, I recommend that the dismissal be with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Eighth Amendment</h2>\n<p>Generally, to prevail on a claim of inadequate prison conditions, a plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the conditions of his confinement resulted in deprivation that was <i>sufficiently serious;</i> and (2) that the defendant acted with <i>deliberate indifference</i> to the plaintiffs health or safety. <i>Farmer v. Brennan,</i> 511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <i>Davidson v. Murray,</i> 371 F.Supp.2d 361, 370 (W.D.N.Y.2005).</p>\n<p>Here, Plaintiff alleges that he was confined in the Special Housing Unit at the Onondaga County Jail for forty-nine days \"without my needs, personal property, etc.\" (Dkt. No. 1, ¶ II.A. [Plf.'s Compl.].) However, Plaintiff does not allege facts plausibly identifying those \"needs\" or that \"personal property,\" rendering his allegation almost entirely conclusory in nature. I find that, as a matter of law, the conditions of confinement alleged by Plaintiff, coupled with the duration of that confinement, does not rise to the level of a deprivation that is sufficiently serious for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. \"As recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Rhodes [ v. Chapman</i><i> ],</i> `the Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons,' ... and conditions that are `restrictive and even harsh ... are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.'\" <i>Davidson,</i> 371 F.Supp.2d at 370 (quoting <i>Rhodes v. Chapman,</i> 452 U.S. 337, 347, 349 [1981]).</p>\n<p>Even if Plaintiff had alleged facts plausibly suggesting that he experienced confinement that was sufficiently serious for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, he has alleged no facts plausibly suggesting that Defendant Callisto acted with <i>deliberate indifference</i> to the plaintiffs health or safety, or was personally involved in Plaintiffs confinement in the Special Housing Unit. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].) I note that \"deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence,\"<sup>[32]</sup> one that is \"equivalent to criminal recklessness.\"<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p>For these reasons, I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim against Defendants for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, because I find that the defects in his Eighth Amendment claim are substantive rather than merely formal, I recommend that the dismissal be with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Fourteenth Amendment</h2>\n<p>The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment contains both a substantive component and a procedural component. <i>Zinermon v. Burch,</i> 494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). The substantive component \"bars certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" <i>Zinermon,</i> 494 U.S. at 125, 110 S.Ct. 975 [internal quotations marks and citation omitted]. The procedural component bars \"the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property... <i>without due process of law.\" Id.</i> at 125-126, 110 S.Ct. 975 [internal quotations marks and citations omitted; emphasis in original]. One of the differences between the two claims is that a substantive due process violation \"is complete when the wrongful action is taken,\" while a procedural due process violation \"is not complete unless and until the State fails to provide due process\" (which may occur <i>after</i> the wrongful action in question). <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Here, I do not liberally construe Plaintiffs Complaint as attempting to assert a substantive due process claim. Even if I were to so construe that Complaint, I would conclude that it fails to state a viable substantive due process claim as a matter of law. \"Substantive due process protects individuals against government action that is arbitrary, ... conscienceshocking,... or oppressive in a constitutional sense, ... but not against constitutional action that is [merely] incorrect or ill-advised.\" <i>Lowrance v. Achtyl,</i> 20 F.3d 529, 537 (2d Cir.1994) [internal quotations marks and citations omitted], <i>affd,</i> 91-CV-1196, <i>Memorandum-Decision and Order</i> (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 1993) (DiBianco, M.J.) (granting summary judgment to defendants in inmate's civil rights action). Plaintiff has not alleged facts plausibly suggesting that his disciplinary conviction for assault (and the segregated confinement that resulted) was arbitrary in the constitutional sense, or even that it was reversed on appeal. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].)</p>\n<p>Rather, I construe Plaintiffs Complaint as attempting to assert a procedural due process claim. \"[Courts] examine procedural due process questions in two steps: the first asks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the State ...; the second examines whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient . ...\" <i>Kentucky Dept. of Corr. v. Thompson,</i> 490 U.S. 454, 460, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989).</p>\n<p>Addressing the first of these two required showings, the United States Supreme Court has determined that, to establish a liberty interest, a plaintiff must sufficiently demonstrate both (1) that the confinement or restraint would impose an \"atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,\" and (2) that the State actually created a protected liberty interest in being free from that confinement or restraint. <i>Sandin v. Conner,</i> 515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <i>Hynes v. Squillance,</i> 143 F.3d 653, 658 (2d Cir.1998); <i>Ciaprazi v. Goord,</i> 02-CV-0915, 2005 WL 3531464, at *11 (N.D.N.Y. Dec.22, 2005) (Sharpe, J., adopting Report-Recommendation by Peebles, M.J.). For the sake of argument, I will assume that New York State has, through its regulatory scheme, created a liberty interest in prisoners remaining free from confinement in a Special Housing Unit. The issue is whether the confinement at issue imposed on Plaintiff an \"atypical and significant hardship ... in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\" Based on even a liberal construction of the allegations of Plaintiffs Complaint, I must answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p>\"When determining whether a plaintiff possesses a cognizable liberty interest, district courts must examine the specific circumstances of confinement, including analysis of both the length and conditions of confinement.\" <i>Ciwprazi,</i> 2005 WL 3531464, *11 [citations omitted].</p>\n<p>Here, Plaintiff alleges that he was confined in the Special Housing Unit at the Onondaga County Jail for a period of forty-nine days. (Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ II.A., II.D. [Plf.'s Compl.].) The problem is that both the Supreme Court and Second Circuit have made clear that a \"short\" period of disciplinary confinement (i.e., under 101 days) under generally \"normal\" conditions (i.e., even if some of those conditions are harsher than those in disciplinary confinement or the general population) usually does not rise to the level of atypicality.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, Plaintiff does not allege facts plausibly suggesting that conditions of confinement he experienced in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit were conditions other than those normally associated with Special Housing Unit confinement in New York State.<sup>[35]</sup> I note that restrictions on the possession of personal property and the receipt of visitors are common in Special Housing Units in New York State.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, even if Plaintiff had alleged facts plausibly suggesting that, under the circumstances, he possessed a protected liberty interest for purposes of a Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process analysis, he has not alleged facts plausibly suggesting that Defendants (or anyone) failed to afford him all the process that he was due. Under <i>Wolff v. McDonnell,</i> 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the constitutionally mandated due process requirements under the circumstances include: (1) advance written notice of the charges at least 24 hours before the hearing; (2) the opportunity to appear at the hearing, to call witnesses, and to present rebuttal evidence, subject to legitimate safety and penological concerns; (3) a written statement by the hearing officer as to the evidence relied on for his decision, and the reasons for the action being taken; and (4) in some circumstances, the right to assistance in preparing a defense. <i>Wolff,</i> 418 U.S. at 564-67, 94 S.Ct. 2963 (not expressly stating there is a right to \"appear at the hearing\").<sup>[37]</sup> Plaintiffs Complaint is conspicuously devoid of factual allegations plausibly suggesting a deprivation of any of these procedural rights. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].)</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs Fourteenth Amendment claim against Defendants for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, because I find that the defects in his Fourteenth Amendment claim are substantive rather than merely formal, I recommend that the dismissal be with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Effect of Plaintiffs New Factual Allegations</h2>\n<p>In his memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts, for the first time in this action, several factual allegations fleshing out, somewhat, the allegations contained in his Complaint. In particular, Plaintiff alleges the following four facts: (1) at some point in time, the hearing officer who presided over Plaintiffs disciplinary hearing (Deputy C. Cummletti) told Plaintiff that his \"boss,\" Anthony Callisto, Jr., \"came down on his [sic] as to punishing [Plaintiff] [sic]....\";<sup>[38]</sup> (2) Onondaga County (either through omissions by C. Cummletti or Defendant Callisto) \"did not ... investigat[] the merit or merits\" of Defendant Spina's disciplinary charges against Plaintiff;<sup>[39]</sup> (3) during his confinement in the Onondaga County Jail's Special Housing Unit, he was \"confined to a cell unsafe living order [sic] with `human waste' on the floors, walls [sic]\";<sup>[40]</sup> and (4) through the disciplinary charges and conviction to which he was subjected, Plaintiff was \"singled out and treated differently from other prisoners in situations [sic].\"<sup>[41]</sup></p>\n<p>I am mindful that, in cases where a <i>pro se</i> civil rights plaintiff is faced with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, courts will often (out of special solicitude) consider materials outside the complaint to the extent they are consistent with the allegations in the complaint.<sup>[42]</sup> Here, as a threshold matter, I will set aside the fact that I previously found that Plaintiffs special solicitude should be somewhat diminished for the remainder of this action due to his considerable litigation experience.<sup>[43]</sup> The more important problem Plaintiff faces is that it would be inappropriate to consider his four new factual allegations for two reasons: (1) the four new allegations are almost entirely inconsistent with the allegations of his Complaint (which is conspicuously silent as to the new facts);<sup>[44]</sup> and (2) the four new allegations are not made in response to a motion to dismiss (which typically occurs relatively early in an action, before discovery has occurred) but in response to a motion for summary judgment (after a fair and reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery has occurred).<sup>[45]</sup> Simply stated, the net effect of permitting Plaintiff to so change the landscape of his claims at this late stage of the action would be to deprive Defendants of the fair notice envisioned by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. I note that the Complaint in this action was filed on November 8, 2005, and discovery closed on December 20, 2006  after the granting of two deadline extensions. (Dkt.Nos. 1, 13, 31, 39.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if the Court were to use the four new factual allegations to effectively amend the allegations of Plaintiffs Complaint, those four new factual allegations would not, either individually or cumulatively, save Plaintiffs claims from dismissal. This is largely due to the lack of detail in the factual allegations.</p>\n<p>For example, with respect to the first new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not specify when C. Cummletti made this statement to Plaintiff, or even that Defendant Callisto was in fact pressuring C. Cummletti to find Plaintiff guilty of the disciplinary charges against him.</p>\n<p>With respect to the second new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not specify who failed to investigate the merits of Defendant Spina's disciplinary charges against Plaintiff. I note that it is not the duty of an impartial hearing officer to conduct such an investigation.<sup>[46]</sup> Indeed, any such involvement in an investigation would likely preclude him from serving as the hearing officer due to a conflict of interest.<sup>[47]</sup> In any event, Plaintiff does not specify how that individual so failed to investigate the merits of the charges against Plaintiff.</p>\n<p>With respect to the third new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not allege that any other poor living conditions existed in his cell, nor does he allege that, upon request, he was denied cleaning supplies to remove the \"human waste\" on the floors and walls of his cell.</p>\n<p>With respect to the fourth new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not allege any facts plausibly suggesting either that (1) he was a member of an identifiable or suspect class or (2) he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated as a result of his membership in that identifiable or suspect class.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the four late-blooming factual allegations in Plaintiffs memorandum of law do not change my recommendation that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims against Defendants for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Failure to Adduce Evidence Sufficient to Create Question of Fact</h2>\n<p>Even if the Court were to look beyond the face of Plaintiffs Complaint to the record evidence adduced by the parties on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the Court would find insufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact.</p>\n<p>More specifically, with respect to Plaintiffs First Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the speech or conduct that he was engaging in when Defendant Spina (allegedly) retaliated against him was \"protected\" for purposes of the First Amendment, (2) Defendant Callisto took, or was personally involved in, any adverse action against him, and (3) Plaintiffs disciplinary conviction (and Special Housing Unit confinement) were caused by any protected speech or conduct. (See <i>generally</i> Dkt. No. 54 [Plf.'s Response Papers]; Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Verified Compl.].)<sup>[48]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the conditions of his confinement in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit, coupled with the duration of that confinement, rose to the level of a deprivation that is sufficiently serious for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, (2) Defendant Callisto acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs health or safety, or was personally involved in Plaintiffs confinement in the Special Housing Unit, or (3) Defendant Spina caused, or even knew about, the (allegedly) inadequate conditions of Plaintiffs confinement in the Special Housing Unit. <i>(Id.)</i></p>\n<p>Finally, with respect to Plaintiffs Fourteenth Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the confinement he experienced in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit created a protected liberty interest for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, or (2) he was denied any of the procedural protections that he was due under the circumstances. <i>(Id.)</i> Indeed, the available record evidence suggests that he was afforded all of the procedural protections that he was due. (<i>See, e.g.,</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 4, at 14-31 [Ex. B to Dougherty Affid., attaching relevant Hearing Notice, Incident Report, Inmate Misbehavior Report, Supplemental Report, Hearing Report, and Hearing Results].)</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, I recommend that, in the alternative, the Court dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint in its entirety under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Municipal Liability</h2>\n<p>In the alternative, Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims against Defendant Onondaga County because Plaintiff has neither alleged facts plausibly suggesting, nor adduced evidence establishing, that the violation of his constitutional rights resulted from a municipal policy or custom. (<i>See</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 10, at 7-9 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff fails to respond to this argument in his memorandum of law. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 54, Plf.'s Opp. Mem. of Law.)</p>\n<p>Where a plaintiff has failed to respond to a defendant's properly filed and facially meritorious memorandum of law (submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment), the plaintiff is deemed to have \"consented\" to the legal arguments contained in that memorandum of law under Local Rule 7.1(b)(3) of the Local Rules of Practice for this Court.<sup>[49]</sup> Stated another way, where a defendant has properly filed a memorandum of law (in support of a properly filed motion for summary judgment), and the plaintiff has failed to respond to that memorandum of law, the only remaining issue is whether the legal arguments advanced in the defendant's memorandum of law are <i>facially meritorious.</i><sup>[50]</sup> A defendant's burden in making legal arguments that are facially meritorious has appropriately been characterized as \"modest.\"<sup>[51]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, I find that Defendants' \"lack of policy\" argument is, at the very least, facially meritorious. Even if I were to subject that argument to more rigorous scrutiny, I would still find that argument to be persuasive.</p>\n<p>It is well established that \"[a] municipality may not be held liable in a § 1983 action for the conduct of a lowerechelon employee solely on the basis of <i>respondeat superior.\"</i><sup>[52]</sup> \"Rather, to establish municipal liability under § 1983 for unconstitutional acts by a municipality's employees, a plaintiff must show that the violation of [his or] her constitutional rights resulted from a municipal custom or policy.\"<sup>[53]</sup> \"Thus, to hold a [municipality] liable under § 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of its employees, a plaintiff is required to ... prove three elements: (1) an official policy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right.\"<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p>With regard to the first element (the existence of a policy or custom), a \"[p]laintiff may establish the `policy, custom or practice' requirement by demonstrating: (1) a formal policy officially endorsed by the municipality ...; (2) actions taken by government officials responsible for establishing municipal policies related to the particular deprivation in question...; (3) a practice so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a `custom or usage' sufficient to impute constructive knowledge to the practice of policymaking officials ...; or (4) a failure by policymakers to train or supervise subordinates to such an extent that it amounts to `deliberate indifference' to the rights of those who come in contact with the municipal employees...\"<sup>[55]</sup> With regard to the second element (causation), a plaintiff must show \"a direct causal link\" or \"an affirmative link\" between the municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation (i.e., that the policy or custom was the \"moving force\" behind the deprivation).<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, I will set aside the issues concerning causation and focus solely on the issues concerning the existence of a relevant policy or custom. Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs Complaint is devoid of factual allegations plausibly suggesting (1) a formal policy officially endorsed by Onondaga County, (2) actions taken by Onondaga County officials responsible for establishing County policies related to the particular deprivation in question, (3) a practice so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a \"custom or usage\" sufficient to impute constructive knowledge of the practice to policymaking officials; or (4) a failure by policymakers to train or supervise deputies working in the Onondaga County Jail to such an extent that it amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates incarcerated in the Onondaga County Jail. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].) Defendants are also correct that Plaintiff has adduced no evidence establishing any of these four things. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 54 [Plf.'s Response Papers]; Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Verified Compl.].)</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, I recommend that, in the alternative, the Court dismiss Plaintiffs claims against Defendant Onondaga County due to the principles of limited municipal liability set forth by <i>Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and its progeny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel</h2>\n<p>Because I have already concluded that adequate grounds exist upon which to base a recommendation of dismissal of Plaintiffs Complaint, I need not reach the merits of Defendants' alternative argument in favor of dismissal, namely, their collateral estoppel argument. I will only pause to make two observations.</p>\n<p>First, based on a review of the petition and decision in Plaintiffs prior Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court, Defendants appear to be correct that at least one of the major issues in this case (i.e., whether Plaintiffs due process rights were violated during his conviction and punishment following the disciplinary charges filed by Defendant Spina) has already been litigated and decided. (<i>See</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 3, at 3-10 [Ex. A to Dougherty Affid., attaching Plaintiffs Petition]; Dkt. No. 52, Part 4, at 4-31 [Ex. B to Dougherty Affid., attaching defendants Verified Answer and Objections in Point of Law, and supporting materials]; Dkt. No. 52, Part 5, at 2-5 [Ex. C to Dougherty Affid., attaching Decision and Order of Acting Supreme Court Justice John Brunetti].)</p>\n<p>Second, Defendants argue, among other things, that Plaintiff deliberately misled the Court when, in his Complaint, he falsely averred that he had no other pending or state federal actions relating to the same facts involved in his federal lawsuit (while, in fact, he had such a pending action, namely, the aforementioned Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court). (Dkt. No. 52, Part 10, at 5-6 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff responds that he did not mislead the Court, or at least did not do so intentionally. (Dkt. No. 54, Plf.'s Mem. of Law, at 3-4.) The relevant portion of Plaintiffs Complaint is Part VI.D., wherein Plaintiff answered \"No\" to the question, \"Have you filed other lawsuits in state or federal court otherwise relating to your imprisonment?\" (Dkt. No. 1, ¶ VI.D. [Plf.'s Compl.].) Setting aside the issue of whether or not Plaintiffs answer was false in the precise manner described by Defendants, I find that Plaintiffs answer was false in another, more obvious regard: Plaintiff failed to disclose to the Court <i>any</i> of the <i>eight</i> other state and federal court actions relating to his imprisonment that he had filed before the date he signed his Complaint, September 30, 2005.<sup>[57]</sup></p>\n<p>Generally, such information is material in prisoner civil rights actions since it enables the Court to determine one or more of the following issues: (1) whether any of the issues in the action have been previously litigated and decided (for purposes of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel); (2) whether the plaintiff had, prior to being granted <i>in forma pauperis status</i> in this action, earned \"three strikes\" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g); (3) whether the plaintiff had a record of frivolous litigation sufficient to warrant either (a) what is known as a \"bar order\" (i.e., an order barring him from litigating further in that court without meeting certain preconditions) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), or (b) an order declaring plaintiff to be a \"vexatious\" litigator pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927; and (4) whether the plaintiffs litigation experience was so extraordinary that it effectively dispenses with the need to afford him special solicitude. While a plaintiff is under no duty to provide this information in order to state an actionable civil rights claim, here, Plaintiff chose to provide the information and swore to the truthfulness of it. Not even inexperience as a <i>pro se</i> litigant excuses such a misrepresentation to the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Doctrine of Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>Because I have already concluded that adequate grounds exist upon which to base a recommendation of dismissal of Plaintiffs Complaint, I need not, and do not, reach the merits of Defendants' final alternative argument in favor of dismissal, namely, their qualified immunity argument.</p>\n<p>ACCORDINGLY, it is</p>\n<p>RECOMMENDED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 52) be <i>GRANTED,</i> and that Plaintiffs Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) be <i>DISMISSED</i> in its entirety with prejudice; and it is further</p>\n<p>RECOMMENDED that the Court certify in writing that any appeal taken from the Court's final judgment in this action would not be taken in good faith, for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Local Rule 72.1(c), the parties have ten days within which to file written objections to the foregoing report. Such objections shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court. FAILURE TO OBJECT TO THIS REPORT WITHIN TEN DAYS WILL PRECLUDE APPELLATE REVIEW. <i>Roldan v.

McAvoy, Senior United States District Judge, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b) and Local Rule 72.3(c). Liberally construed, Plaintiffs Complaint alleges that, in February and March of 2004, two employees of the Onondaga County Jail  Chief Custody Deputy Anthony Callisto, Jr., and Deputy Cheryl Spina (\"Defendants\")  violated Plaintiffs rights under the First, Eighth and/or Fourteenth Amendments when (1) Defendant Spina filed a false disciplinary report charging Plaintiff with assault, in retaliation for Plaintiffs having embarrassed her by calling her \"ugly,\" causing Plaintiff to be convicted of that charge and illegally confined to the Special Housing Unit at the Onondaga County Jail for a period of forty-nine days without life's basic necessities, and (2) Defendant Callisto failed to prevent either the duration or conditions of that incarceration. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].)</p>\n<p>Currently pending before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. (Dkt. No. 52.) Generally, Defendants' motion is premised on the following alternative grounds: (1) Plaintiffs failure to allege facts plausibly suggesting any constitutional violations; (2) Plaintiffs failure to adduce evidence establishing any constitutional violations; (3) the principles of limited municipal liability established by <i>Monell v.

No. 52, Part 10 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) For the reasons that follow, I recommend that Defendants' motion be granted, and that Plaintiffs Complaint be dismissed in its entirety with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD</h2>\n<p>Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is warranted if \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In determining whether a genuine issue of material<sup>[1]</sup> fact exists, the Court must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>However, when the moving party has met its initial burden of establishing the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party must come forward with \"specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\"<sup>[3]</sup> The nonmoving party must do more than \"rest upon the mere allegations ... of the [plaintiffs] pleading\" or \"simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.\"<sup>[4]</sup> Rather, \"[a] dispute regarding a material fact is <i>genuine</i> if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Where a non-movant fails to adequately oppose a properly supported factual assertion made in a motion for summary judgment, a district court has no duty to perform an independent review of the record to find proof of a factual dispute,<sup>[6]</sup> even if that non-movant is proceeding <i>pro se.</i><sup>[7]</sup> In the event the district court chooses to conduct such an independent review of the record, any verified complaint filed by the plaintiff should be treated as an affidavit.<sup>[8]</sup> (Here, I note that Plaintiffs' Complaint contains a verification pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 174<sup>[9]</sup>) In any event, to be sufficient to create a factual issue for purposes of a summary judgment motion, an affidavit must, among other things, not be conclusory.<sup>[10]</sup>\" An affidavit is conclusory if, for example, its assertions lack any supporting evidence or are too general.<sup>[11]</sup> Finally, even where an affidavit (or verified complaint) is nonconclusory, it may be insufficient to create a factual issue where it is (1) \"largely unsubstantiated by any other direct evidence\" and (2) \"so replete with inconsistencies and improbabilities that no reasonable juror would undertake the suspension of disbelief necessary to credit the allegations made in the complaint.\"<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim Under Rule 12(b)(6)</h2>\n<p>To the extent that a defendant's motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is based entirely on the plaintiffs complaint,<sup>[13]</sup> such a motion is functionally the same as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). As a result, \"[w]here appropriate, a trial judge may dismiss for failure to state a cause of action upon motion for summary judgment.\" <i>Schwartz v. Compagnie General Transatlantique,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"282907\"><a href=\"/opinion/282907/robert-j-schwartz-v-compagnie-general-transatlantique-and-third-party-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span>, 273-74 (2d Cir.1968) [citations omitted], <i>accord, </i><i>Katz v.

Under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). It has long been understood that a defendant may base such a motion on either or both of two grounds: (1) a challenge to the \"sufficiency of the pleading\" under Rule 8(a)(2);<sup>[15]</sup> or (2) a challenge to the legal cognizability of the claim.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>Rule 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading include \"a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). Such a statement must \"give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\"<sup>[17]</sup> The purpose of this rule is to \"facilitate a proper decision on the merits.\"<sup>[18]</sup> A complaint that fails to comply with this rule \"presents far too a heavy burden in terms of defendants' duty to shape a comprehensive defense and provides no meaningful basis for the Court to assess the sufficiency of [plaintiffs] claims.\"<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has long characterized this pleading requirement under Rule 8(a)(2) as \"simplified\" and \"liberal,\" and has repeatedly rejected judicially established pleading requirements that exceed this liberal requirement.<sup>[20]</sup> However, it is well established that even this liberal notice pleading standard \"has its limits.\"<sup>[21]</sup> As a result, several Supreme Court and Second Circuit decisions exist, holding that a pleading has failed to meet this liberal notice pleading standard.<sup>[22]</sup></p>\n<p>Most notably, in the recent decision of <i>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> the Supreme Court, in reversing an appellate decision holding that a complaint had stated a claim upon which relief could be granted, \"retire[d]\" the famous statement by the Court in <i>Conley v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007).<sup>[23]</sup> Rather than turning on the <i>conceivability</i> of an actionable claim, the Court clarified, the Rule 8 standard turns on the \"plausibility\" of an actionable claim. <i>Id.</i> at 1965-74. More specifically, the Court held that, for a plaintiffs complaint to state a claim, his \"[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level [to a plausible level]\" assuming, of course, that all the allegations in the complaint are true. <i>Id.</i> at 1965 [citations omitted]. What this means, on a practical level, is that there must be \"plausible grounds to infer [actionable conduct],\" or, in other words, \"enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of [actionable conduct].\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Iqbal v.

Indeed, generally \"courts must construe <i>pro se</i> pleadings broadly, and interpret them to raise the strongest arguments that they suggest.\"<sup>[26]</sup> In addition, when addressing a <i>pro se</i> complaint, generally a district court \"should not dismiss without granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated.\"<sup>[27]</sup></p>\n<p>However, when a plaintiff is proceeding <i>pro se,</i> \"all normal rules of pleading are not absolutely suspended.\"<sup>[28]</sup> For example, an opportunity to amend should be denied where \"the problem with [plaintiffs] causes of action is substantive\" such that \"[b]etter pleading will not cure it.\"<sup>[29]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Failure to State a Claim</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. First Amendment</h2>\n<p>Claims of retaliation like those asserted by Plaintiff find their roots in the First Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Gill v. Pidlypchak,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788363\"><a href=\"/opinion/788363/anthony-g-gill-v-chris-pidlypchak-correction-officer-tg-dygert/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span>, 380-81 (2d Cir.2004). Central to such claims is the notion that in a prison setting, corrections officials may not take actions which would have a chilling effect upon an inmate's exercise of First Amendment rights. <i>See </i><i>Gill,</i> 389 F.3d at 381-383. Because of the relative ease with which claims of retaliation can be incanted, however, courts have scrutinized such retaliation claims with particular care. <i>See </i><i>Flaherty v. Coughlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"422039\"><a href=\"/opinion/422039/kerry-flaherty-v-thomas-a-coughlin-iii-commissioner-new-york-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 13 (2d Cir.1983). As the Second Circuit has noted,</p>\n<blockquote>[t]his is true for several reasons. First, claims of retaliation are difficult to dispose of on the pleadings because they involve questions of intent and are therefore easily fabricated. Second, prisoners' claims of retaliation pose a substantial risk of unwarranted judicial intrusion into matters of general prison administration. This is so because virtually any adverse action taken against a prisoner by a prison official  even those otherwise not rising to the level of a constitutional violation  can be characterized as a constitutionally proscribed retaliatory act.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Dawes v.

I know of no case law that would support a conclusion that such speech or conduct <i>against a prison guard</i> is protected by the First Amendment.<sup>[30]</sup> Indeed, the instructive cases that I have found are quite to the contrary. For example, in <i>Brooks v.

However, Plaintiff does not allege facts plausibly identifying those \"needs\" or that \"personal property,\" rendering his allegation almost entirely conclusory in nature. I find that, as a matter of law, the conditions of confinement alleged by Plaintiff, coupled with the duration of that confinement, does not rise to the level of a deprivation that is sufficiently serious for purposes of the Eighth Amendment. \"As recognized by the Supreme Court in <i>Rhodes [ v. Chapman</i><i> ],</i> `the Constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons,' ... and conditions that are `restrictive and even harsh ... are part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society.'\" <i>Davidson,</i> 371 F.Supp.2d at 370 (quoting <i>Rhodes v.

(<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].) I note that \"deliberate indifference describes a state of mind more blameworthy than negligence,\"<sup>[32]</sup> one that is \"equivalent to criminal recklessness.\"<sup>[33]</sup></p>\n<p>For these reasons, I recommend that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim against Defendants for failure to state a claim. Furthermore, because I find that the defects in his Eighth Amendment claim are substantive rather than merely formal, I recommend that the dismissal be with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3.

For the sake of argument, I will assume that New York State has, through its regulatory scheme, created a liberty interest in prisoners remaining free from confinement in a Special Housing Unit.

(Dkt. No. 1, ¶¶ II.A., II.D. [Plf.'s Compl.].) The problem is that both the Supreme Court and Second Circuit have made clear that a \"short\" period of disciplinary confinement (i.e., under 101 days) under generally \"normal\" conditions (i.e., even if some of those conditions are harsher than those in disciplinary confinement or the general population) usually does not rise to the level of atypicality.<sup>[34]</sup></p>\n<p>Moreover, Plaintiff does not allege facts plausibly suggesting that conditions of confinement he experienced in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit were conditions other than those normally associated with Special Housing Unit confinement in New York State.<sup>[35]</sup> I note that restrictions on the possession of personal property and the receipt of visitors are common in Special Housing Units in New York State.<sup>[36]</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, even if Plaintiff had alleged facts plausibly suggesting that, under the circumstances, he possessed a protected liberty interest for purposes of a Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process analysis, he has not alleged facts plausibly suggesting that Defendants (or anyone) failed to afford him all the process that he was due.

Furthermore, because I find that the defects in his Fourteenth Amendment claim are substantive rather than merely formal, I recommend that the dismissal be with prejudice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Effect of Plaintiffs New Factual Allegations</h2>\n<p>In his memorandum of law in opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff asserts, for the first time in this action, several factual allegations fleshing out, somewhat, the allegations contained in his Complaint. In particular, Plaintiff alleges the following four facts: (1) at some point in time, the hearing officer who presided over Plaintiffs disciplinary hearing (Deputy C. Cummletti) told Plaintiff that his \"boss,\" Anthony Callisto, Jr., \"came down on his [sic] as to punishing [Plaintiff] [sic]....\";<sup>[38]</sup> (2) Onondaga County (either through omissions by C. Cummletti or Defendant Callisto) \"did not ... investigat[] the merit or merits\" of Defendant Spina's disciplinary charges against Plaintiff;<sup>[39]</sup> (3) during his confinement in the Onondaga County Jail's Special Housing Unit, he was \"confined to a cell unsafe living order [sic] with `human waste' on the floors, walls [sic]\";<sup>[40]</sup> and (4) through the disciplinary charges and conviction to which he was subjected, Plaintiff was \"singled out and treated differently from other prisoners in situations [sic].\"<sup>[41]</sup></p>\n<p>I am mindful that, in cases where a <i>pro se</i> civil rights plaintiff is faced with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, courts will often (out of special solicitude) consider materials outside the complaint to the extent they are consistent with the allegations in the complaint.<sup>[42]</sup> Here, as a threshold matter, I will set aside the fact that I previously found that Plaintiffs special solicitude should be somewhat diminished for the remainder of this action due to his considerable litigation experience.<sup>[43]</sup> The more important problem Plaintiff faces is that it would be inappropriate to consider his four new factual allegations for two reasons: (1) the four new allegations are almost entirely inconsistent with the allegations of his Complaint (which is conspicuously silent as to the new facts);<sup>[44]</sup> and (2) the four new allegations are not made in response to a motion to dismiss (which typically occurs relatively early in an action, before discovery has occurred) but in response to a motion for summary judgment (after a fair and reasonable opportunity to conduct discovery has occurred).<sup>[45]</sup> Simply stated, the net effect of permitting Plaintiff to so change the landscape of his claims at this late stage of the action would be to deprive Defendants of the fair notice envisioned by Fed.R.Civ.P. 8. I note that the Complaint in this action was filed on November 8, 2005, and discovery closed on December 20, 2006  after the granting of two deadline extensions. (Dkt.Nos. 1, 13, 31, 39.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, even if the Court were to use the four new factual allegations to effectively amend the allegations of Plaintiffs Complaint, those four new factual allegations would not, either individually or cumulatively, save Plaintiffs claims from dismissal. This is largely due to the lack of detail in the factual allegations.</p>\n<p>For example, with respect to the first new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not specify when C. Cummletti made this statement to Plaintiff, or even that Defendant Callisto was in fact pressuring C. Cummletti to find Plaintiff guilty of the disciplinary charges against him.</p>\n<p>With respect to the second new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not specify who failed to investigate the merits of Defendant Spina's disciplinary charges against Plaintiff. I note that it is not the duty of an impartial hearing officer to conduct such an investigation.<sup>[46]</sup> Indeed, any such involvement in an investigation would likely preclude him from serving as the hearing officer due to a conflict of interest.<sup>[47]</sup> In any event, Plaintiff does not specify how that individual so failed to investigate the merits of the charges against Plaintiff.</p>\n<p>With respect to the third new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not allege that any other poor living conditions existed in his cell, nor does he allege that, upon request, he was denied cleaning supplies to remove the \"human waste\" on the floors and walls of his cell.</p>\n<p>With respect to the fourth new factual allegation, Plaintiff does not allege any facts plausibly suggesting either that (1) he was a member of an identifiable or suspect class or (2) he was intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated as a result of his membership in that identifiable or suspect class.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, the four late-blooming factual allegations in Plaintiffs memorandum of law do not change my recommendation that the Court dismiss Plaintiffs First, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims against Defendants for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Failure to Adduce Evidence Sufficient to Create Question of Fact</h2>\n<p>Even if the Court were to look beyond the face of Plaintiffs Complaint to the record evidence adduced by the parties on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the Court would find insufficient evidence to create a material issue of fact.</p>\n<p>More specifically, with respect to Plaintiffs First Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the speech or conduct that he was engaging in when Defendant Spina (allegedly) retaliated against him was \"protected\" for purposes of the First Amendment, (2) Defendant Callisto took, or was personally involved in, any adverse action against him, and (3) Plaintiffs disciplinary conviction (and Special Housing Unit confinement) were caused by any protected speech or conduct. (See <i>generally</i> Dkt. No. 54 [Plf.'s Response Papers]; Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Verified Compl.].)<sup>[48]</sup></p>\n<p>With respect to Plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the conditions of his confinement in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit, coupled with the duration of that confinement, rose to the level of a deprivation that is sufficiently serious for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, (2) Defendant Callisto acted with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs health or safety, or was personally involved in Plaintiffs confinement in the Special Housing Unit, or (3) Defendant Spina caused, or even knew about, the (allegedly) inadequate conditions of Plaintiffs confinement in the Special Housing Unit. <i>(Id.)</i></p>\n<p>Finally, with respect to Plaintiffs Fourteenth Amendment claim, he has adduced no evidence establishing that (1) the confinement he experienced in the Onondaga County Jail Special Housing Unit created a protected liberty interest for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment, or (2) he was denied any of the procedural protections that he was due under the circumstances. <i>(Id.)</i> Indeed, the available record evidence suggests that he was afforded all of the procedural protections that he was due. (<i>See, e.g.,</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 4, at 14-31 [Ex. B to Dougherty Affid., attaching relevant Hearing Notice, Incident Report, Inmate Misbehavior Report, Supplemental Report, Hearing Report, and Hearing Results].)</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, I recommend that, in the alternative, the Court dismiss Plaintiffs Complaint in its entirety under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Municipal Liability</h2>\n<p>In the alternative, Defendants argue that the Court should dismiss Plaintiffs claims against Defendant Onondaga County because Plaintiff has neither alleged facts plausibly suggesting, nor adduced evidence establishing, that the violation of his constitutional rights resulted from a municipal policy or custom. (<i>See</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 10, at 7-9 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff fails to respond to this argument in his memorandum of law. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 54, Plf.'s Opp. Mem. of Law.)</p>\n<p>Where a plaintiff has failed to respond to a defendant's properly filed and facially meritorious memorandum of law (submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment), the plaintiff is deemed to have \"consented\" to the legal arguments contained in that memorandum of law under Local Rule 7.1(b)(3) of the Local Rules of Practice for this Court.<sup>[49]</sup> Stated another way, where a defendant has properly filed a memorandum of law (in support of a properly filed motion for summary judgment), and the plaintiff has failed to respond to that memorandum of law, the only remaining issue is whether the legal arguments advanced in the defendant's memorandum of law are <i>facially meritorious.</i><sup>[50]</sup> A defendant's burden in making legal arguments that are facially meritorious has appropriately been characterized as \"modest.\"<sup>[51]</sup></p>\n<p>Here, I find that Defendants' \"lack of policy\" argument is, at the very least, facially meritorious. Even if I were to subject that argument to more rigorous scrutiny, I would still find that argument to be persuasive.</p>\n<p>It is well established that \"[a] municipality may not be held liable in a § 1983 action for the conduct of a lowerechelon employee solely on the basis of <i>respondeat superior.\"</i><sup>[52]</sup> \"Rather, to establish municipal liability under § 1983 for unconstitutional acts by a municipality's employees, a plaintiff must show that the violation of [his or] her constitutional rights resulted from a municipal custom or policy.\"<sup>[53]</sup> \"Thus, to hold a [municipality] liable under § 1983 for the unconstitutional actions of its employees, a plaintiff is required to ... prove three elements: (1) an official policy or custom that (2) causes the plaintiff to be subjected to (3) a denial of a constitutional right.\"<sup>[54]</sup></p>\n<p>With regard to the first element (the existence of a policy or custom), a \"[p]laintiff may establish the `policy, custom or practice' requirement by demonstrating: (1) a formal policy officially endorsed by the municipality ...; (2) actions taken by government officials responsible for establishing municipal policies related to the particular deprivation in question...; (3) a practice so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a `custom or usage' sufficient to impute constructive knowledge to the practice of policymaking officials ...; or (4) a failure by policymakers to train or supervise subordinates to such an extent that it amounts to `deliberate indifference' to the rights of those who come in contact with the municipal employees...\"<sup>[55]</sup> With regard to the second element (causation), a plaintiff must show \"a direct causal link\" or \"an affirmative link\" between the municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation (i.e., that the policy or custom was the \"moving force\" behind the deprivation).<sup>[56]</sup></p>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, I will set aside the issues concerning causation and focus solely on the issues concerning the existence of a relevant policy or custom. Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs Complaint is devoid of factual allegations plausibly suggesting (1) a formal policy officially endorsed by Onondaga County, (2) actions taken by Onondaga County officials responsible for establishing County policies related to the particular deprivation in question, (3) a practice so consistent and widespread that it constitutes a \"custom or usage\" sufficient to impute constructive knowledge of the practice to policymaking officials; or (4) a failure by policymakers to train or supervise deputies working in the Onondaga County Jail to such an extent that it amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of inmates incarcerated in the Onondaga County Jail. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Compl.].) Defendants are also correct that Plaintiff has adduced no evidence establishing any of these four things. (<i>See generally</i> Dkt. No. 54 [Plf.'s Response Papers]; Dkt. No. 1 [Plf.'s Verified Compl.].)</p>\n<p>For all of these reasons, I recommend that, in the alternative, the Court dismiss Plaintiffs claims against Defendant Onondaga County due to the principles of limited municipal liability set forth by <i>Monell v. Dept. of Soc. Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1978), and its progeny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Doctrine of Collateral Estoppel</h2>\n<p>Because I have already concluded that adequate grounds exist upon which to base a recommendation of dismissal of Plaintiffs Complaint, I need not reach the merits of Defendants' alternative argument in favor of dismissal, namely, their collateral estoppel argument. I will only pause to make two observations.</p>\n<p>First, based on a review of the petition and decision in Plaintiffs prior Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court, Defendants appear to be correct that at least one of the major issues in this case (i.e., whether Plaintiffs due process rights were violated during his conviction and punishment following the disciplinary charges filed by Defendant Spina) has already been litigated and decided. (<i>See</i> Dkt. No. 52, Part 3, at 3-10 [Ex. A to Dougherty Affid., attaching Plaintiffs Petition]; Dkt. No. 52, Part 4, at 4-31 [Ex. B to Dougherty Affid., attaching defendants Verified Answer and Objections in Point of Law, and supporting materials]; Dkt. No. 52, Part 5, at 2-5 [Ex. C to Dougherty Affid., attaching Decision and Order of Acting Supreme Court Justice John Brunetti].)</p>\n<p>Second, Defendants argue, among other things, that Plaintiff deliberately misled the Court when, in his Complaint, he falsely averred that he had no other pending or state federal actions relating to the same facts involved in his federal lawsuit (while, in fact, he had such a pending action, namely, the aforementioned Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court). (Dkt. No. 52, Part 10, at 5-6 [Defs.' Mem. of Law].) Plaintiff responds that he did not mislead the Court, or at least did not do so intentionally. (Dkt. No. 54, Plf.'s Mem. of Law, at 3-4.) The relevant portion of Plaintiffs Complaint is Part VI.D., wherein Plaintiff answered \"No\" to the question, \"Have you filed other lawsuits in state or federal court otherwise relating to your imprisonment?\" (Dkt. No. 1, ¶ VI.D. [Plf.'s Compl.].) Setting aside the issue of whether or not Plaintiffs answer was false in the precise manner described by Defendants, I find that Plaintiffs answer was false in another, more obvious regard: Plaintiff failed to disclose to the Court <i>any</i> of the <i>eight</i> other state and federal court actions relating to his imprisonment that he had filed before the date he signed his Complaint, September 30, 2005.<sup>[57]</sup></p>\n<p>Generally, such information is material in prisoner civil rights actions since it enables the Court to determine one or more of the following issues: (1) whether any of the issues in the action have been previously litigated and decided (for purposes of the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel); (2) whether the plaintiff had, prior to being granted <i>in forma pauperis status</i> in this action, earned \"three strikes\" for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g); (3) whether the plaintiff had a record of frivolous litigation sufficient to warrant either (a) what is known as a \"bar order\" (i.e., an order barring him from litigating further in that court without meeting certain preconditions) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), or (b) an order declaring plaintiff to be a \"vexatious\" litigator pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927; and (4) whether the plaintiffs litigation experience was so extraordinary that it effectively dispenses with the need to afford him special solicitude. While a plaintiff is under no duty to provide this information in order to state an actionable civil rights claim, here, Plaintiff chose to provide the information and swore to the truthfulness of it. Not even inexperience as a <i>pro se</i> litigant excuses such a misrepresentation to the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Doctrine of Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>Because I have already concluded that adequate grounds exist upon which to base a recommendation of dismissal of Plaintiffs Complaint, I need not, and do not, reach the merits of Defendants' final alternative argument in favor of dismissal, namely, their qualified immunity argument.</p>\n<p>ACCORDINGLY, it is</p>\n<p>RECOMMENDED that Defendants' motion for summary judgment (Dkt. No. 52) be <i>GRANTED,</i> and that Plaintiffs Complaint (Dkt. No. 1) be <i>DISMISSED</i> in its entirety with prejudice; and it is further</p>\n<p>RECOMMENDED that the Court certify in writing that any appeal taken from the Court's final judgment in this action would not be taken in good faith, for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3).</p>\n<p>Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1) and Local Rule 72.1(c), the parties have ten days within which to file written objections to the foregoing report.
