Hayes appeals from the district court’s order granting summary judgment on\nhis 42 United States Code § 1983 claim in favor of Tom Kessler and Melodee Armfield. We\naffirm.\n                                                    I.\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n          Hayes is an inmate in the custody of the Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC). On\nOctober 23, 2013, Hayes brought a civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nmultiple violations of his constitutional rights.\n          Hayes’ original complaint named the following defendants: Corrections Corporation of\nAmerica, Idaho Correctional Center, Tim Wengler, Dan Melody, Tom Kessler, Flemming Green,\nMelodee Armfield, and Shane Jepsen. However, Hayes served his complaint on only the Idaho\nCorrectional Center, Kessler, and Armfield. Counsel for the served defendants moved to dismiss\n\n                                                    1\n\fHayes’ claims against the unserved parties and filed a motion to dismiss Hayes’ claims against\nthe Idaho Correctional Center on the basis that a prison is not a “person” for purposes of a\n§ 1983 action. Hayes responded to the motion to dismiss and also filed a motion to amend his\ncomplaint. The district court denied Hayes’ motion to amend, as the served defendants had\nalready filed a responsive pleading. The district court granted the motion to dismiss the unserved\nparties as well as the Idaho Correctional Center.\n       The remaining defendants, Kessler and Armfield (Respondents), then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment on the outstanding claims. In support of their motion for summary judgment,\nRespondents filed sworn declarations from Kessler, Armfield, and an Idaho Correctional Center\ndentist who treated Hayes. Hayes responded to the motion for summary judgment, but included\nno sworn statements or other supporting evidence with his response. The district court construed\nthe remaining claims to include Hayes’ contention that his constitutional rights were infringed\nupon when prison employees refused to provide him with a dental pick, made threatening and\ndisparaging remarks toward him, and followed unconstitutional disciplinary procedures. The\ndistrict court found that Hayes had failed to establish that he had suffered a constitutional\nviolation as to those claims against Respondents. The district court granted Respondents’ motion\nfor summary judgment. Hayes timely appeals.\n                                                II.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n       Hayes presents nine issues on appeal:            (1) the district court should have allowed\ndiscovery; (2) the complaint stated multiple claims upon which relief could be granted; (3) the\npleadings stated genuine issues of disputed material facts; (4) Hayes had arguable and\nnonfrivolous claims to pursue; (5) the district court’s findings of fact were not supported by any\nreasonable interpretation of the case evidence; (6) the district court’s conclusions of law were not\nin compliance with federal and state law; (7) the district court should have allowed Hayes to\namend his complaint; (8) the district court erred in deciding questions of material fact in favor of\nRespondents; and (9) the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\nRespondents.\n       As a preliminary matter, this Court does not consider an issue that is not “supported by\nargument and authority in the opening brief.” Idaho Appellate Rule 35(a)(6); Jorgensen v.\nCoppedge, 145 Idaho 524, 528, 181 P.3d 450, 454 (2008). Regardless of whether an issue is\n\n                                                    2\n\fexplicitly set forth in the party’s brief as one of the issues on appeal, if an issue is only\nmentioned in passing and not supported by cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered\nby this Court. Liponis v. Bach, 149 Idaho 372, 374, 234 P.3d 696, 698 (2010). Although Hayes\nlists his first and seventh claims as issues, they are neither argued nor supported by authority in\nhis briefing. Accordingly, we do not address Hayes’ first and seventh claims of error.\n        The remaining issues all boil down to the same basic inquiry--whether the district court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents. We exercise free review in\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Edwards v. Conchemco, Inc., 111 Idaho 851, 852, 727\nP.2d 1279, 1280 (Ct. App. 1986). Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Idaho Rule\nof Civil Procedure 56(c). The movant has the burden of showing that no genuine issues of\nmaterial fact exist. Stoddart v. Pocatello Sch. Dist. No. 25, 149 Idaho 679, 683, 239 P.3d 784,\n788 (2010). The burden may be met by establishing the absence of evidence on an element that\nthe nonmoving party will be required to prove at trial. Dunnick v. Elder, 126 Idaho 308, 311,\n882 P.2d 475, 478 (Ct. App. 1994). Such an absence of evidence may be established either by an\naffirmative showing with the moving party’s own evidence or by a review of all the nonmoving\nparty’s evidence and the contention that such proof of an element is lacking. Heath v. Honker’s\nMini-Mart, Inc., 134 Idaho 711, 712, 8 P.3d 1254, 1255 (Ct. App. 2000).\n        Once such an absence of evidence has been established, the burden then shifts to the\nparty opposing the motion to show, via further depositions, discovery responses or affidavits,\nthat there is indeed a genuine issue for trial or to offer a valid justification for the failure to do so\nunder I.R.C.P. 56(d). Sanders v. Kuna Joint Sch. Dist., 125 Idaho 872, 874, 876 P.2d 154, 156\n(Ct. App. 1994).      Disputed facts and reasonable inferences are construed in favor of the\nnonmoving party. Castorena v. General Elec., 149 Idaho 609, 613, 238 P.3d 209, 213 (2010).\nThis Court freely reviews issues of law. Cole v. Kunzler, 115 Idaho 552, 555, 768 P.2d 815, 818\n(Ct. App. 1989).\n        The claims at issue in this appeal have all been brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\nThere are two threshold requirements for a § 1983 claim: (1) a person must act under color of\nstate law when committing the challenged act; and (2) the claimant must establish that the\n\n                                                   3\n\fconduct deprived the claimant of a constitutionally protected right, privilege or immunity. Dana,\nLarson, Roubal & Assoc. v. Bd. of Comm’rs of Canyon Cty., 124 Idaho 794, 798, 864 P.2d 632,\n636 (Ct. App. 1993). It is undisputed that Respondents were acting under color of state law\nwhen performing the acts of which Hayes complains. However, Hayes disputes the district\ncourt’s finding that Hayes did not plead sufficient facts or provide sufficient evidence to\nestablish that Respondents’ conduct deprived Hayes of constitutionally protected rights. We\naddress these purported constitutional violations in turn.\nA.     Dental Pick\n       Hayes’ first relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when he was\ndenied his request for a dental pick. In July 2011, while housed in administrative segregation,\nHayes requested a dental pick from Sergeant Green to dislodge some food trapped between\nHayes’ teeth. Sergeant Green denied this request because dental picks were not allowed in the\nsegregation housing unit pursuant to IDOC policies. Hayes filed an official grievance regarding\nSergeant Green’s refusal, which was denied. Hayes then contested the Level One response to his\ngrievance, which Kessler reviewed. Kessler concurred with the Level One denial of Hayes’\ngrievance.\n       In his § 1983 complaint, Hayes alleged that Kessler conspired with other officials to\ndeprive Hayes of a needed hygiene item which led to the formation of a severe gum infection\nthat required antibiotic treatment. He argued that this denial violated his constitutional right to\nbe free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n       The Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment requires prison\nofficials to “provide humane conditions of confinement.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832\n(1994). “[P]rison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and\nmedical care.”    Id.   The Eighth Amendment protects a detainee not only from deliberate\nindifference to his or her current serious health problems, but also from deliberate indifference to\nconditions posing an unreasonable risk of serious damage to future health. Helling v. McKinney,\n509 U.S. 25, 33-35 (1993).\n       Thus, to survive summary judgment under either theory, Hayes was required to show that\nKessler acted with deliberate indifference to Hayes’ health. See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S.\n1, 5, (1992); Hayes v. Conway, 144 Idaho 503, 507, 163 P.3d 1215, 1219 (Ct. App. 2007). A\ndetermination of deliberate indifference involves an examination of two elements: the\n\n                                                 4\n\fseriousness of the prisoner’s medical need and the nature of the prison’s response to that need.\nHayes, 144 Idaho at 507, 163 P.3d at 1219. It is undisputed that Hayes’ periodontal disease is a\nserious medical condition and one that he has been suffering from since at least 2005. Thus, the\nkey inquiry is whether Kessler’s response to Hayes’ grievance amounted to deliberate\nindifference to Hayes’ periodontal disease.\n        To show a prison official was deliberately indifferent, the inmate must show that the\nprison official knew that the inmate faced a substantial risk of serious harm, and the prison\nofficial disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Brennan, 511\nU.S. at 847. “[T]he official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at\n837. Although an inmate is not constitutionally guaranteed the exact treatment he or she\ndemands, an official’s failure to respond to a known medical problem can constitute deliberate\nindifference. Hayes, 144 Idaho at 507, 163 P.3d at 1219.\n        Hayes’ allegations with regard to Kessler’s conduct are insufficient to establish the\nrequisite element that Kessler acted with deliberate indifference in failing to attend to Hayes’\nmedical condition. In his original complaint, Hayes stated that Kessler “conspired with” prison\nofficials to deny Hayes medical care. This bare assertion is insufficient to support a claim of\nconspiracy. See Grider v. City of Auburn, Ala., 618 F.3d 1240, 1260 (7th Cir. 2010) (“A plaintiff\nclaiming a § 1983 conspiracy must prove the defendants ‘reached an understanding’ to violate\nthe plaintiff’s constitutional rights.” (quoting Bailey v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of Alachua Cty., 956\nF.2d 1112, 1122 (11th Cir.1992)). Hayes’ complaint contains no allegations of an agreement\nand, even if the court construed all claims in the light most favorable to Hayes, his conspiracy\nclaim would still fail.\n        Also in his complaint, Hayes stated that Kessler “condoned” the actions of other prison\nofficials in denying Hayes the dental pick. For this claim to succeed, Hayes must show that\nKessler knew that Hayes faced a substantial risk of harm from being denied a dental pick and\nthat Kessler disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Hayes’\nallegations are insufficient to establish the requisite element of deliberate indifference.\n        First, Hayes provides no support for his bare assertion that the general act of denying\ninmates dental picks creates a substantial risk of harm.          Courts have previously found a\nprolonged denial of a toothbrush or toothpaste can create a substantial risk of harm, but have\n\n                                                  5\n\fnever extended the possibility of harm to the denial of dental floss or dental picks. See, e.g.,\nFlanory v. Bonn, 604 F.3d 249, 254 (6th Cir. 2010); Board v. Farnham, 394 F.3d 469, 478-79\n(7th Cir. 2005). Moreover, Hayes makes no assertion that Kessler knew that Hayes faced a\nsubstantial risk of harm due to the condition of his dental health specifically. There is no\nevidence that Kessler was aware of Hayes’ history of periodontal disease or that Hayes’ dental\nhealth could be compromised by being denied of a dental pick. Conversely, evidence was\nprovided by Respondents contradicting the utility of a dental pick as related to Hayes’ gum\ninfection. The dentist who cleaned Hayes’ teeth on July 28, 2011, provided a sworn affidavit in\nwhich he opined, “Hayes’ condition on July 28, 2011, was a result of years of periodontal\ndisease and poor dental health and not the result of the lack of a dental pick for 39 days . . . even\nif Hayes had a dental pick during this time frame, he would have still suffered from periodontal\ndisease.”1\n       Hayes has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements for a\nsuccessful claim of a constitutional violation under the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, the\ndistrict court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim to Respondents.\nB.     Threats and Disparaging Remarks\n       Hayes’ second relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when\nSergeant Green made threatening and disparaging remarks to Hayes. In August 2011, Hayes\nfiled a grievance form alleging that Sergeant Green threatened Hayes at his cell door. He\nspecifically alleged that Sergeant Green threatened to punch Hayes in the face if he continued to\n“smart off” to Sergeant Green. After Hayes’ initial grievance was denied, he appealed. Kessler\nreviewed the Level One response, concurring in the initial denial. In his § 1983 complaint,\nHayes alleged that Kessler was involved in covering up Sergeant Green’s “illegal and\nunconstitutional behavior.”\n       Generally, threats and disparaging remarks do not rise to the level of a § 1983 claim.\nKing v. Olmsted Cty., 117 F.3d 1065, 1067 (8th Cir. 1997). For a threat to constitute an\n\n\n1\n         As Hayes has failed to request the inclusion of the sworn affidavits that accompanied the\nRespondents’ motion for summary judgment, we accept the dentist’s statement as written by the\ndistrict court in its order granting Respondents’ motion. It is the responsibility of the appellant to\nprovide an adequate record to support his or her claims on appeal, and in the absence of an\nadequate record, we will not presume error. Belk v. Martin, 136 Idaho 652, 660, 39 P.3d 592,\n600 (2001).\n                                                  6\n\factionable constitutional violation, it must be so brutal or wantonly cruel as to “shock the\nconscience.” Cty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 846-47 (1998). The measure of what is\nconscience-shocking is guided by traditional ideas of fair play and decency.            See id.   By\nthemselves, threats are typically insufficient to “shock the conscience.” See Keenan v. Hall, 83\nF.3d 1083, 1092 (9th Cir. 1996) (finding no violation where guard made disrespectful and\nassaultive comments); Hopson v. Fredericksen, 961 F.2d 1374, 1378-79 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding\nthat racial slurs and threats to physically harm arrestee insufficient to constitute constitutional\nclaim under § 1983). But see Burton v. Livingston, 791 F.2d 97, 100 (8th Cir. 1986) (finding that\nthreat, combined with conduct, shocked the conscience where prison officer cocked trigger and\naimed gun at prisoner while instructing him to run so he could justify shooting him).\n       Even when viewed in a light most favorable to Hayes, the alleged threats made by\nSergeant Green, although inappropriate, do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\nThus, Kessler could not have acted to cover up a nonexistent constitutional violation. Hayes has\nfailed to show a constitutional violation on this claim. Thus, the district court did not err in\ngranting summary judgment to Respondents on this claim.\nC.     Disciplinary Procedures\n       Hayes’ final relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when Armfield\nfound Hayes guilty after holding a disciplinary proceeding against him in reference to a “false”\nDisciplinary Offense Report (DOR) without affording Hayes certain due process rights. The\nDOR at issue was filed by Sergeant Green on July 13, 2011. In Hayes’ § 1983 complaint, he\nspecifically alleged that he was not given notice of the hearing date, was not allowed to read his\nstatement into the record, and was not allowed to get witness statements. He further alleged that\nhe was placed into administrative segregation as a result of this proceeding. He argued that this\nconstituted an unconstitutional denial of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n       To determine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment have been violated, a court must first determine if the individual had a protected\nliberty or property interest. Schevers v. State, 129 Idaho 573, 575, 930 P.2d 603, 605 (1996). It\nis well established that in determining if a prisoner has a protected liberty interest, the court\nlooks to whether the restriction imposed constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484\n(1995); Schevers, 129 Idaho at 576, 930 P.2d at 606; Briggs v. Kempf, 146 Idaho 172, 175, 191\n\n                                                7\n\fP.3d 250, 253 (Ct. App. 2008). In other words, the court looks at whether the restrictions\nconstitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life. Briggs, 146 Idaho at\n175, 191 P.3d at 253.\n       Here, in support of their motion for summary judgment, Respondents submitted the\nsworn affidavit of Armfield, who presided over Hayes’ disciplinary proceeding on this DOR.\nArmfield attested, “After considering the evidence at the hearing, I confirmed Hayes’ DOR . . . I\ndid not impose any discipline on Hayes for this DOR.” Respondents maintain that because\nHayes was not punished for this disciplinary violation, there was no implication of a liberty\ninterest to invoke protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       With the presentation of this evidence in support of their motion for summary judgment,\nthe burden then shifted to Hayes to show, via further depositions, discovery responses or\naffidavits, that there was indeed a genuine issue for trial. In his response to Respondents’\nsummary judgment motion, Hayes provided only additional unsworn declarations that he was\nplaced in administrative segregation for “1362 days as a direct result of the DOR.” 2 The\nunsworn allegations by Hayes are insufficient to rebut the sworn affidavits from Respondents.\nBased on the admissible evidence before the district court, Hayes failed to show that he had a\nprotected liberty interest sufficient to implicate Fourteenth Amendment due process protections.\nThus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Respondents on this claim.\n                                               III.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       The evidence before the district court revealed that there were no genuine issues as to any\nmaterial facts regarding Hayes’ claims of constitutional violations. The district court did not err\nin granting Respondents’ motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we affirm the order of the\ndistrict court. Costs to Respondents.\n       Chief Judge MELANSON and Judge GRATTON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n2\n       Hayes’ responsive brief to Respondents’ summary judgment motion is not part of the\nrecord on appeal, thus we accept the district court’s representation of its contents.

Hayes appeals from the district court’s order granting summary judgment on\nhis 42 United States Code § 1983 claim in favor of Tom Kessler and Melodee Armfield. We\naffirm.\n                                                    I.\n                       FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n          Hayes is an inmate in the custody of the Idaho Department of Correction (IDOC). On\nOctober 23, 2013, Hayes brought a civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging\nmultiple violations of his constitutional rights.\n          Hayes’ original complaint named the following defendants: Corrections Corporation of\nAmerica, Idaho Correctional Center, Tim Wengler, Dan Melody, Tom Kessler, Flemming Green,\nMelodee Armfield, and Shane Jepsen. However, Hayes served his complaint on only the Idaho\nCorrectional Center, Kessler, and Armfield. Counsel for the served defendants moved to dismiss\n\n                                                    1\n\fHayes’ claims against the unserved parties and filed a motion to dismiss Hayes’ claims against\nthe Idaho Correctional Center on the basis that a prison is not a “person” for purposes of a\n§ 1983 action. Hayes responded to the motion to dismiss and also filed a motion to amend his\ncomplaint. The district court denied Hayes’ motion to amend, as the served defendants had\nalready filed a responsive pleading. The district court granted the motion to dismiss the unserved\nparties as well as the Idaho Correctional Center.\n       The remaining defendants, Kessler and Armfield (Respondents), then filed a motion for\nsummary judgment on the outstanding claims. In support of their motion for summary judgment,\nRespondents filed sworn declarations from Kessler, Armfield, and an Idaho Correctional Center\ndentist who treated Hayes. Hayes responded to the motion for summary judgment, but included\nno sworn statements or other supporting evidence with his response. The district court construed\nthe remaining claims to include Hayes’ contention that his constitutional rights were infringed\nupon when prison employees refused to provide him with a dental pick, made threatening and\ndisparaging remarks toward him, and followed unconstitutional disciplinary procedures. The\ndistrict court found that Hayes had failed to establish that he had suffered a constitutional\nviolation as to those claims against Respondents. The district court granted Respondents’ motion\nfor summary judgment. Hayes timely appeals.\n                                                II.\n                                           ANALYSIS\n       Hayes presents nine issues on appeal:            (1) the district court should have allowed\ndiscovery; (2) the complaint stated multiple claims upon which relief could be granted; (3) the\npleadings stated genuine issues of disputed material facts; (4) Hayes had arguable and\nnonfrivolous claims to pursue; (5) the district court’s findings of fact were not supported by any\nreasonable interpretation of the case evidence; (6) the district court’s conclusions of law were not\nin compliance with federal and state law; (7) the district court should have allowed Hayes to\namend his complaint; (8) the district court erred in deciding questions of material fact in favor of\nRespondents; and (9) the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of\nRespondents.\n       As a preliminary matter, this Court does not consider an issue that is not “supported by\nargument and authority in the opening brief.” Idaho Appellate Rule 35(a)(6); Jorgensen v.\nCoppedge, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 528, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634324\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634324/jorgensen-v-coppedge/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (2008). Regardless of whether an issue is\n\n                                                    2\n\fexplicitly set forth in the party’s brief as one of the issues on appeal, if an issue is only\nmentioned in passing and not supported by cogent argument or authority, it cannot be considered\nby this Court. Liponis v. Bach, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">372</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"874252\"><a href=\"/opinion/874252/liponis-v-bach/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698 (2010). Although Hayes\nlists his first and seventh claims as issues, they are neither argued nor supported by authority in\nhis briefing. Accordingly, we do not address Hayes’ first and seventh claims of error.\n        The remaining issues all boil down to the same basic inquiry--whether the district court\nerred in granting summary judgment in favor of Respondents. We exercise free review in\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Edwards v. Conchemco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1204534\"><a href=\"/opinion/1204534/edwards-v-conchemco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1204534\"><a href=\"/opinion/1204534/edwards-v-conchemco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">727</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1280 (Ct.

Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, depositions, and\nadmissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Idaho Rule\nof Civil Procedure 56(c). The movant has the burden of showing that no genuine issues of\nmaterial fact exist. Stoddart v. Pocatello Sch. Dist.

The burden may be met by establishing the absence of evidence on an element that\nthe nonmoving party will be required to prove at trial. Dunnick v.

App. 1994). Such an absence of evidence may be established either by an\naffirmative showing with the moving party’s own evidence or by a review of all the nonmoving\nparty’s evidence and the contention that such proof of an element is lacking. Heath v. Honker’s\nMini-Mart, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569664/heath-v-honkers-mini-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2569664\"><a href=\"/opinion/2569664/heath-v-honkers-mini-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255 (Ct.

Dana,\nLarson, Roubal & Assoc. v. Bd. of Comm’rs of Canyon Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1199746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1199746/dana-larson-roubal-v-board-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1199746\"><a href=\"/opinion/1199746/dana-larson-roubal-v-board-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">864</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n636 (Ct. App. 1993). It is undisputed that Respondents were acting under color of state law\nwhen performing the acts of which Hayes complains. However, Hayes disputes the district\ncourt’s finding that Hayes did not plead sufficient facts or provide sufficient evidence to\nestablish that Respondents’ conduct deprived Hayes of constitutionally protected rights. We\naddress these purported constitutional violations in turn.\nA.     Dental Pick\n       Hayes’ first relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when he was\ndenied his request for a dental pick. In July 2011, while housed in administrative segregation,\nHayes requested a dental pick from Sergeant Green to dislodge some food trapped between\nHayes’ teeth. Sergeant Green denied this request because dental picks were not allowed in the\nsegregation housing unit pursuant to IDOC policies. Hayes filed an official grievance regarding\nSergeant Green’s refusal, which was denied. Hayes then contested the Level One response to his\ngrievance, which Kessler reviewed. Kessler concurred with the Level One denial of Hayes’\ngrievance.\n       In his § 1983 complaint, Hayes alleged that Kessler conspired with other officials to\ndeprive Hayes of a needed hygiene item which led to the formation of a severe gum infection\nthat required antibiotic treatment. He argued that this denial violated his constitutional right to\nbe free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.\n       The Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment requires prison\nofficials to “provide humane conditions of confinement.” Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832\n(1994). “[P]rison officials must ensure that inmates receive adequate food, clothing, shelter, and\nmedical care.”    Id.   The Eighth Amendment protects a detainee not only from deliberate\nindifference to his or her current serious health problems, but also from deliberate indifference to\nconditions posing an unreasonable risk of serious damage to future health. Helling v. McKinney,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112888\"><a href=\"/opinion/112888/helling-v-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33-35 (1993).\n       Thus, to survive summary judgment under either theory, Hayes was required to show that\nKessler acted with deliberate indifference to Hayes’ health. See Hudson v. McMillian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5, (1992); Hayes v. Conway, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 507, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (Ct. App. 2007). A\ndetermination of deliberate indifference involves an examination of two elements: the\n\n                                                 4\n\fseriousness of the prisoner’s medical need and the nature of the prison’s response to that need.\nHayes, 144 Idaho at 507, 163 P.3d at 1219. It is undisputed that Hayes’ periodontal disease is a\nserious medical condition and one that he has been suffering from since at least 2005. Thus, the\nkey inquiry is whether Kessler’s response to Hayes’ grievance amounted to deliberate\nindifference to Hayes’ periodontal disease.\n        To show a prison official was deliberately indifferent, the inmate must show that the\nprison official knew that the inmate faced a substantial risk of serious harm, and the prison\nofficial disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Brennan, 511\nU.S. at 847. “[T]he official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at\n837. Although an inmate is not constitutionally guaranteed the exact treatment he or she\ndemands, an official’s failure to respond to a known medical problem can constitute deliberate\nindifference. Hayes, 144 Idaho at 507, 163 P.3d at 1219.\n        Hayes’ allegations with regard to Kessler’s conduct are insufficient to establish the\nrequisite element that Kessler acted with deliberate indifference in failing to attend to Hayes’\nmedical condition. In his original complaint, Hayes stated that Kessler “conspired with” prison\nofficials to deny Hayes medical care. This bare assertion is insufficient to support a claim of\nconspiracy. See Grider v. City of Auburn, Ala., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">618</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1260 (7th Cir. 2010) (“A plaintiff\nclaiming a § 1983 conspiracy must prove the defendants ‘reached an understanding’ to violate\nthe plaintiff’s constitutional rights.” (quoting Bailey v. Bd. of Cty. Comm'rs of Alachua Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577792\"><a href=\"/opinion/577792/gregg-fitzgerald-bailey-and-lizzie-shirley-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1122 (11th Cir.1992)). Hayes’ complaint contains no allegations of an agreement\nand, even if the court construed all claims in the light most favorable to Hayes, his conspiracy\nclaim would still fail.\n        Also in his complaint, Hayes stated that Kessler “condoned” the actions of other prison\nofficials in denying Hayes the dental pick. For this claim to succeed, Hayes must show that\nKessler knew that Hayes faced a substantial risk of harm from being denied a dental pick and\nthat Kessler disregarded that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it. Hayes’\nallegations are insufficient to establish the requisite element of deliberate indifference.\n        First, Hayes provides no support for his bare assertion that the general act of denying\ninmates dental picks creates a substantial risk of harm.          Courts have previously found a\nprolonged denial of a toothbrush or toothpaste can create a substantial risk of harm, but have\n\n                                                  5\n\fnever extended the possibility of harm to the denial of dental floss or dental picks. See, e.g.,\nFlanory v. Bonn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145976\"><a href=\"/opinion/145976/flanory-v-bonn/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (6th Cir. 2010); Board v.

Moreover, Hayes makes no assertion that Kessler knew that Hayes faced a\nsubstantial risk of harm due to the condition of his dental health specifically. There is no\nevidence that Kessler was aware of Hayes’ history of periodontal disease or that Hayes’ dental\nhealth could be compromised by being denied of a dental pick. Conversely, evidence was\nprovided by Respondents contradicting the utility of a dental pick as related to Hayes’ gum\ninfection. The dentist who cleaned Hayes’ teeth on July 28, 2011, provided a sworn affidavit in\nwhich he opined, “Hayes’ condition on July 28, 2011, was a result of years of periodontal\ndisease and poor dental health and not the result of the lack of a dental pick for 39 days . . . even\nif Hayes had a dental pick during this time frame, he would have still suffered from periodontal\ndisease.”1\n       Hayes has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish the necessary elements for a\nsuccessful claim of a constitutional violation under the Eighth Amendment. Therefore, the\ndistrict court did not err in granting summary judgment on this claim to Respondents.\nB.     Threats and Disparaging Remarks\n       Hayes’ second relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when\nSergeant Green made threatening and disparaging remarks to Hayes. In August 2011, Hayes\nfiled a grievance form alleging that Sergeant Green threatened Hayes at his cell door. He\nspecifically alleged that Sergeant Green threatened to punch Hayes in the face if he continued to\n“smart off” to Sergeant Green. After Hayes’ initial grievance was denied, he appealed. Kessler\nreviewed the Level One response, concurring in the initial denial. In his § 1983 complaint,\nHayes alleged that Kessler was involved in covering up Sergeant Green’s “illegal and\nunconstitutional behavior.”\n       Generally, threats and disparaging remarks do not rise to the level of a § 1983 claim.\nKing v. Olmsted Cty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743112\"><a href=\"/opinion/743112/robert-w-king-linda-bandel-king-individually-and-on-behalf-of-nathaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1065</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1067 (8th Cir. 1997). For a threat to constitute an\n\n\n1\n         As Hayes has failed to request the inclusion of the sworn affidavits that accompanied the\nRespondents’ motion for summary judgment, we accept the dentist’s statement as written by the\ndistrict court in its order granting Respondents’ motion. It is the responsibility of the appellant to\nprovide an adequate record to support his or her claims on appeal, and in the absence of an\nadequate record, we will not presume error. Belk v.

But see Burton v. Livingston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470122\"><a href=\"/opinion/470122/willie-burton-jr-v-a-livingston/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (8th Cir. 1986) (finding that\nthreat, combined with conduct, shocked the conscience where prison officer cocked trigger and\naimed gun at prisoner while instructing him to run so he could justify shooting him).\n       Even when viewed in a light most favorable to Hayes, the alleged threats made by\nSergeant Green, although inappropriate, do not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.\nThus, Kessler could not have acted to cover up a nonexistent constitutional violation. Hayes has\nfailed to show a constitutional violation on this claim. Thus, the district court did not err in\ngranting summary judgment to Respondents on this claim.\nC.     Disciplinary Procedures\n       Hayes’ final relevant claim is that his constitutional rights were violated when Armfield\nfound Hayes guilty after holding a disciplinary proceeding against him in reference to a “false”\nDisciplinary Offense Report (DOR) without affording Hayes certain due process rights. The\nDOR at issue was filed by Sergeant Green on July 13, 2011. In Hayes’ § 1983 complaint, he\nspecifically alleged that he was not given notice of the hearing date, was not allowed to read his\nstatement into the record, and was not allowed to get witness statements. He further alleged that\nhe was placed into administrative segregation as a result of this proceeding. He argued that this\nconstituted an unconstitutional denial of his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n       To determine whether an individual’s due process rights under the Fourteenth\nAmendment have been violated, a court must first determine if the individual had a protected\nliberty or property interest. Schevers v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452682/schevers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452682/schevers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605 (1996). It\nis well established that in determining if a prisoner has a protected liberty interest, the court\nlooks to whether the restriction imposed constitutes an “atypical and significant hardship on the\ninmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.” Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484\n(1995); Schevers, 129 Idaho at 576, 930 P.2d at 606; Briggs v. Kempf, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Idaho</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 175, 191\n\n                                                </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (Ct. App. 2008). In other words, the court looks at whether the restrictions\nconstitute a dramatic departure from the basic conditions of prison life. Briggs, 146 Idaho at\n175, 191 P.3d at 253.\n       Here, in support of their motion for summary judgment, Respondents submitted the\nsworn affidavit of Armfield, who presided over Hayes’ disciplinary proceeding on this DOR.\nArmfield attested, “After considering the evidence at the hearing, I confirmed Hayes’ DOR . . . I\ndid not impose any discipline on Hayes for this DOR.” Respondents maintain that because\nHayes was not punished for this disciplinary violation, there was no implication of a liberty\ninterest to invoke protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       With the presentation of this evidence in support of their motion for summary judgment,\nthe burden then shifted to Hayes to show, via further depositions, discovery responses or\naffidavits, that there was indeed a genuine issue for trial. In his response to Respondents’\nsummary judgment motion, Hayes provided only additional unsworn declarations that he was\nplaced in administrative segregation for “1362 days as a direct result of the DOR.” 2 The\nunsworn allegations by Hayes are insufficient to rebut the sworn affidavits from Respondents.\nBased on the admissible evidence before the district court, Hayes failed to show that he had a\nprotected liberty interest sufficient to implicate Fourteenth Amendment due process protections.\nThus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Respondents on this claim.\n                                               III.\n                                        CONCLUSION\n       The evidence before the district court revealed that there were no genuine issues as to any\nmaterial facts regarding Hayes’ claims of constitutional violations. The district court did not err\nin granting Respondents’ motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we affirm the order of the\ndistrict court. Costs to Respondents.\n       Chief Judge MELANSON and Judge GRATTON CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n2\n       Hayes’ responsive brief to Respondents’ summary judgment motion is not part of the\nrecord on appeal, thus we accept the district court’s representation of its contents. See Belk, 136\nIdaho at 660, 39 P.3d at 600.\n                                                8\n\f</pre>",
