BAXTER BRINKMANN, Appellees\n\n                     On Appeal from the 192nd Judicial District Court\n                                  Dallas County, Texas\n                            Trial Court Cause No. 08-05771\n\n                                        OPINION\n                         Before Justices FitzGerald, Lang, and Myers\n                                   Opinion by Justice Lang\n\n       This case arises from a written contract (the “Agreement”) under which appellee J.\n\nBaxter Brinkmann International Corporation (“JBBI”) employed appellant Berryman’s South\n\nFork, Inc. (“BSF”) for the purpose of “engaging the full-time services” of appellant Richard\n\nBerryman (“Berryman”) as a “sales and marketing representative.” Appellees JBBI and The\n\nBrinkmann Corporation (“TBC”) filed this lawsuit against appellants asserting claims for, in\n\npart, declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and money had and received. Appellants (1)\n\ncounterclaimed against JBBI for, in part, breach of an alleged contract to pay Berryman’s\n\nexpenses and (2) asserted claims against J. Baxter Brinkmann, individually, (“Brinkmann”) as a\n\fthird party defendant. 1 Appellees filed a motion for (1) traditional summary judgment in their\n\nfavor on the claims asserted by JBBI and TBC and appellants’ counterclaims and (2) no-\n\nevidence summary judgment in their favor on appellants’ counterclaims. The trial court signed a\n\nfinal judgment in which it (1) sustained appellees’ objections to an affidavit of Berryman filed by\n\nappellants as summary judgment evidence, (2) granted appellees’ motion for summary judgment,\n\n(3) made declarations respecting the Agreement, and (4) awarded appellees damages, attorneys’\n\nfees, interest, and costs of court.\n\n           In eleven issues on appeal, appellants contend the trial court erred because (1) the\n\nevidence raises fact issues as to the parties’ claims; (2) the declaratory relief requested by JBBI\n\nand TBC was “redundant with” their breach of contract claim and therefore was “barred as a\n\nmatter of law”; (3) appellees “failed to conclusively prove the reasonableness and necessity of\n\nthe claimed [attorneys’] fees by not segregating fees”; (4) Brinkmann, individually, did not\n\nrecover on any cause of action and therefore should not have been awarded damages, attorneys’\n\nfees, interest, or costs of court; and (5) the sustaining of appellees’ objections to Berryman’s\n\naffidavit constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n           For the reasons below, on this voluminous summary judgment record, we reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in part, render judgment in part, and otherwise affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                            I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n    1\n        In this opinion, unless otherwise specified, “appellees” refers to, collectively, JBBI, TBC, and Brinkmann.\n\n\n\n                                                                       –2–\n\f          The Agreement was executed on July 2, 2001. 2 It stated in part that JBBI “desires to\n\nemploy the services of [Berryman], through [BSF], for the benefit of [JBBI] and its affiliated\n\ncompanies.” Additionally, the Agreement provided in part\n\n          2. Compensation\n\n          In exchange for the services to be rendered hereunder by [Berryman], [JBBI] shall\n          pay, or cause to be paid, the sum of one million dollars per year in equal monthly\n          installments. . . .\n\n          3. Term\n\n          This Agreement is for a term of five years starting August 1, 2001 and is to be\n          renewed annually thereafter unless either parties [sic] gives notice in writing 90\n          days prior to the end of any anniversary date. Notwithstanding the five year fixed\n          term, [JBBI] may terminate this Agreement and have no further payment\n          obligation if [Berryman] is unable to perform full-time services due to death or\n          disability or has failed to carry out the duties of a senior sales and marketing\n          representative in accord with general industry standards.\n\n          Approximately seven years after the Agreement was executed, an attorney for appellants\n\nsent JBBI a letter dated May 20, 2008. In that letter, appellants’ attorney stated that as a result of\n\nactions taken by JBBI, “including, but not limited to, making defamatory statements” to JBBI\n\nemployees and others, JBBI had “substantially undermined [Berryman’s] ability to perform his\n\njob duties and responsibilities” and therefore had “constructively terminated [Berryman] and\n\nbreached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the Agreement.”\n\nFurther, appellants’ attorney (1) stated JBBI had “failed and refused” to reimburse Berryman for\n\napproximately $160,000 in expenses that JBBI was “obligated to pay” pursuant to “Mr.\n\nBerryman’s contract” with JBBI and (2) requested that JBBI contact him to “negotiate a fair and\n\nequitable severance for Mr. Berryman.”\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      As described above, the parties to the Agreement were JBBI and BSF. Additionally, Berryman, individually, guaranteed the obligations\nof BSF.\n\n\n\n                                                                  –3–\n\f       On May 23, 2008, JBBI and TBC (“plaintiffs”) filed this lawsuit against BSF and\n\nBerryman (“defendants”). In their original petition, plaintiffs asserted a claim for “declaratory\n\njudgment relief.” Specifically, plaintiffs requested in part that the trial court declare (1) “whether\n\n[d]efendants have carried on its or their required duties under the terms of the [Agreement]”; (2)\n\nthat plaintiffs have not violated the terms of their “agreements or obligations, if any,” to\n\ndefendants; and (3) “other declaratory relief as necessary to terminate the controversy and\n\nremove uncertainty relating to the [plaintiffs’] alleged remaining rights and obligations to\n\n[d]efendants, if any.” Further, plaintiffs requested “reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred herein and on any appeal.”\n\n       In a letter to defendants dated August 29, 2008, counsel for JBBI stated (1) defendants\n\nhad failed to perform as obligated under the Agreement “for some months now” and (2) JBBI\n\n“hereby terminates the Agreement as permitted in Section 3 and as otherwise allowed by law.”\n\nSubsequent to that letter, plaintiffs filed supplements to their original petition in which they\n\nadded claims for breach of contract and “money had and received/unjust enrichment.” In their\n\nbreach of contract claim, plaintiffs alleged in part that defendants “failed and refused and\n\ncontinue to fail and refuse to fulfill their obligations under the [Agreement],” thus entitling\n\nplaintiffs to damages and attorneys’ fees. In their claim for “money had and received/unjust\n\nenrichment,” plaintiffs asserted in part that “during the May 2008 through August 2008 time\n\nperiod,” defendants “received monies they were not entitled to keep and to which they have been\n\nunjustly enriched.” Pursuant to that claim, plaintiffs sought to recover approximately $334,000\n\nreceived by defendants during that time period, including (1) “$291,666.66 paid during a time\n\nperiod [defendants] performed no work for [plaintiffs]” and (2) approximately $42,000 in\n\n“Airplane Allowance payments” made to defendants pursuant to a “separate verbal agreement”\n\nthat plaintiffs would “provide [d]efendants an upfront allowance for expenses (up to $12,000 per\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fmonth) [d]efendants incurred related to the operation of an aircraft to be used to assist\n\n[d]efendants in performing their duties owed to [p]laintiffs” (the “Airplane Allowance”).\n\n           Defendants filed a general denial answer and asserted several affirmative defenses,\n\nincluding “equitable estoppel.” Additionally, defendants asserted (1) a counterclaim against\n\nJBBI for “breach of contract relating to reimbursement of expenses,” in which defendants\n\ncontended they were owed $157,600.83 in “expenses not paid” by JBBI; and (2) claims for\n\nbusiness disparagement, defamation, and exemplary damages against Brinkmann as a third-party\n\ndefendant.\n\n           JBBI and Brinkmann filed separate general denial answers to defendants’ counterclaims.\n\nAdditionally, JBBI asserted several affirmative defenses, including the statute of frauds. Further,\n\nin Brinkmann’s prayer for relief in his answer, he requested, in part, that he recover costs of\n\ncourt.\n\n           On December 12, 2011, plaintiffs and Brinkmann filed a motion for (1) traditional\n\nsummary judgment on plaintiffs’ breach of contract, money had and received, and declaratory\n\njudgment claims and defendants’ counterclaims and (2) no-evidence summary judgment on\n\ndefendants’ counterclaims. In their motion, plaintiffs stated in part (1) “[b]ased on [d]efendants’\n\nbreach of contract, [p]laintiffs are entitled to elect as their remedy the recovery of the largest\n\ndamage amount suffered due to [d]efendants’ breach, such amount being the $291,666,67 paid\n\nfrom May through August 2008, plus attorney’s fees totaling $160,948.00”; (2) to “prevent\n\nunjust enrichment,” defendants must return to plaintiffs “overpayments” of “$291.666.67 for\n\nwork not performed” 3 and “$41,999.96 in Airplane Allowance payments”; (3) defendants\n\n“ceased performing under the Agreement in at least May of 2008, and thereby materially\n\n\n     3\n       Plaintiffs stated in their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment that they “will only be entitled to collect and will only seek\nthe $291,666.67 once.”\n\n\n\n                                                                        –5–\n\fbreached same”; (4) “[t]he Agreement was terminable from [May of 2008] forward by\n\n[p]laintiffs, and no further obligations are due under the Agreement following its lawful\n\ntermination in August 2008”; (5) “[n]otwithstanding [p]laintiffs’ proper termination of\n\nAgreement for cause, the Agreement actually expired on August 1, 2008”; and (6) JBBI did not\n\nbreach the Agreement or “any ancillary agreement to pay business expenses.”\n\n       The appendix filed in support of the summary judgment motion included, in part (1)\n\nexcerpts from depositions of Berryman and Brinkmann; (2) an affidavit of Brinkmann; (3) copies\n\nof the Agreement and correspondence described above; and (4) an affidavit of plaintiffs’ counsel\n\nrespecting attorneys’ fees.\n\n       Berryman stated in part in his deposition that (1) his job responsibilities pursuant to the\n\nAgreement included preparing for and attending meetings with retailers’ representatives to solicit\n\norders for JBBI’s products, communicating “almost on a daily basis” with Brinkmann, and\n\nparticipating in the “finalization” process respecting retailers’ orders; (2) during two separate\n\nmeetings in 2006 and 2008, Brinkmann complained in front of retailers’ representatives that\n\nBerryman “didn’t work” and buyers did not want to do business with Berryman; (3) Berryman\n\nwas still able to perform his duties after Brinkmann’s negative comments were made; (4) in\n\napproximately April 2008, JBBI hired Mike Bush; (5) at the time Bush was hired, Bush told\n\nBerryman that Berryman was “being replaced” by Bush; (6) Berryman was not replaced by\n\nBush; (7) there is no written agreement for reimbursement of expenses; (8) at approximately the\n\nsame time the Agreement was executed in 2001, Berryman and Brinkmann entered into an oral\n\nagreement that Berryman’s business expenses would be reimbursed by JBBI; (9) after May 20,\n\n2008, Berryman did not return Brinkmann’s calls, with one exception in which he told\n\nBrinkmann his attorney had advised him not to speak with Brinkmann; did not participate in\n\n\n\n\n                                               –6–\n\f“finalization” negotiations; and did not attend any meetings; and (10) from May 2008 to August\n\n2008, Berryman continued to receive and accept checks from Brinkmann.\n\n       Brinkmann testified in part in his deposition and affidavit (1) although reimbursement of\n\nBerryman’s expenses was not part of “the deal,” he reimbursed Berryman for various expenses\n\nstarting in 2001 and continuing until at least 2006; (2) defendants ceased performing their\n\nrequired duties under the Agreement “as early as the first half of May 2008”; (3) after defendants\n\nceased performing under the Agreement, JBBI “hoped [d]efendants would resume performance”\n\nand paid BSF $41,999.96 in airplane allowance payments and an additional sum of more than\n\n$291,666.67; and (4) BSF and Berryman have not returned those amounts to plaintiffs.\n\n       Finally, counsel for plaintiffs testified in part in his affidavit (1) at least 85%, or\n\n$127,073, of the attorneys’ fees and paralegal fees incurred by plaintiffs so far “are recoverable\n\nagainst the [d]efendants in this lawsuit”; (2) “it is reasonable to conclude that [plaintiffs’]\n\ncounsel’s activities cannot all be segregated by task and as such are dependent on the same or\n\nsimilar sets of facts and circumstances, are part of many of the same tasks, and are therefore so\n\nintertwined that they cannot be so separated or segregated”; (3) a fair estimate of additional\n\nattorneys’ fees likely be incurred by plaintiffs through the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment to advance plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims” against defendants is at least\n\n$33,875; and (4) in the event of appeal of plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims,” plaintiffs will likely\n\nincur at least an additional $35,000 in fees in defense of an appeal to the Dallas Court of\n\nAppeals, $20,000 in fees in briefing an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, and $15,000 in fees\n\nif the Texas Supreme Court grants a hearing on such appeal.\n\n       In their amended response to plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, defendants\n\nargued in part (1) the agreement to pay expenses was an enforceable “oral modification” and/or\n\n“implied in fact modification” of the “original contract” entered into between the parties on July\n\n                                               –7–\n\f2, 2001; (2) Berryman was justified in discontinuing performance under “the written contract and\n\noral modification of the contract” in May 2008 because he was relieved of performance by\n\nplaintiffs’ “material breach,” i.e. plaintiffs’ “slanderous statements,” hiring of Bush, and failure\n\nto pay Berryman’s expenses; (3) equitable relief is not warranted because Berryman received and\n\naccepted the sums paid to him as part of the damages he is entitled to receive as a result of\n\nplaintiffs’ “material breach” of the “contract between the parties”; and (4) the statute of frauds\n\ndoes not apply to the oral agreement to reimburse expenses because “each of the claims was\n\ncapable of being performed within one year” and, alternatively, “part performance by the\n\nparties” takes the oral agreement outside the statute of frauds. Attachments to defendants’\n\nresponse included an affidavit of Berryman and an “Expense Report Tracking Log” that showed\n\n$157,600.83 in “outstanding” expenses incurred by Berryman from 2006 to 2008.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed (1) “objections to and motion to strike defendants’ ‘evidence’ in support\n\nof their amended response” and (2) supplemental objections to defendants’ summary judgment\n\nevidence. Therein, plaintiffs contended Berryman’s affidavit (1) contains irrelevant testimony;\n\n(2) lacks necessary attachments; (3) is a “sham affidavit” as to specified statements of Berryman\n\nin paragraphs 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, and 28; (4) “fails to set forth actual facts based upon\n\nBerryman’s personal knowledge”; and (5) “cites Berryman’s conclusory personal beliefs based\n\nupon conjecture and hearsay.”       Specifically, in an objection to Berryman’s affidavit “as a\n\nwhole,” plaintiffs stated in part\n\n       Berryman amended his [affidavit] to assert that he possessed personal knowledge\n       of all of “the facts set forth” in the [affidavit], based upon (1) his conversations\n       with [Brinkmann], (2) conversations with unidentified employees of JBBI, (3) the\n       unattached “business records” of JBBI . . . and (4) the unattached “business\n       records” of [BSF]. Berryman cannot rely on hearsay to demonstrate his “personal\n       knowledge.”\n\n(citation to record omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                –8–\n\f          Additionally, plaintiffs filed a reply to defendants’ response to the motion for summary\n\njudgment. Plaintiffs asserted in part (1) defendants’ election to continue performance after\n\nplaintiffs’ alleged nonpayment of expenses starting in 2006 precluded any excuse for defendants’\n\nterminating performance; (2) defendants’ response did not raise a legal claim or fact issue\n\nrespecting defendants’ contentions that plaintiffs “prevented [d]efendants from being able to\n\nperform under the [Agreement]” or “‘constructively terminated’ [d]efendants”; (3) defendants\n\nhave no damages for breach because plaintiffs “paid the entire value” of the Agreement; (4) the\n\noral agreement alleged by defendants respecting payment of expenses was not performable\n\nwithin one year and therefore is precluded by the statute of frauds and, alternatively, “lacks\n\ndefinitive contract terms”; and (5) while defendants’ response “appears to argue” that application\n\nof the statute of frauds is precluded by “partial performance,” defendants provide “only a\n\nfootnote citation without analysis” respecting that argument.\n\n          In the final judgment described above, 4 the trial court (1) defined “movants” as JBBI,\n\nTBC, and Brinkmann, collectively, and (2) ordered that “summary judgment is granted in favor\n\nof Movants on their breach of contract, money had and received, and declaratory judgment\n\nclaims.” Further, the trial court ordered therein that “Movants shall recover from Defendants,\n\njointly and severally,” (1) “actual damages in the amount of $333,666.63,” which “includes\n\n$291,666.67 for contract payments made by Plaintiffs to Defendants when work was not being\n\nperformed by Defendants, and $41,999.96 in Airplane Allowance payments made by Plaintiffs to\n\nDefendants when work was not being performed by Defendants”; (2) “their reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees as a result of the above-mentioned breach of contract and declaratory\n\njudgment claims in the amount of $160,948.00”; (3) “$49,117.95 in pre-judgment interest on the\n\n\n     4\n       The record shows a hearing on appellees’ motion for summary judgment was scheduled. However, the record contains no reporter’s\nrecord of such hearing.\n\n\n\n                                                               –9–\n\faforesaid amount (excluding attorney’s fees)”; (4) additional attorneys’ fees in the event of\n\nappeal “as set forth in the Movants’ uncontested attorneys’ fees affidavit”; and (5) “all costs of\n\ncourt incurred and filed with the Court in this action.” Additionally, the trial court ordered that\n\n“the total amount of this Judgment, $543,732.58, plus costs of court, will bear post-judgment\n\ninterest at the rate of 5%, compounded annually.” Finally, the trial court made declarations\n\nrespecting plaintiffs’ declaratory judgment claim. 5\n\n           Defendants filed a timely motion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law.\n\nThis appeal timely followed.\n\n                                                   II. SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n                                                          A. Standard of Review\n\n           We review a summary judgment de novo to determine whether a party’s right to prevail\n\nis established as a matter of law. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289\n\nS.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009); Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.\n\n2005); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985). We review the\n\nevidence presented by the motion and response in the light most favorable to the party against\n\nwhom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if\n\nreasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.\n\n   5\n       Specifically, the trial court stated in the final judgment\n\n           [T]he court holds the following as a matter of undisputed fact and law as it related to Movants’ declaratory judgment claim:\n\n           a. Defendants ceased performing under the Agreement in, at least, May of 2008 when Berryman refused to fulfill his duties\n           and obligations for Plaintiffs. This constituted a material breach of the Agreement. The Agreement was at a minimum\n           terminable from that point forward by Plaintiffs, and after making every reasonable effort to communicate with Berryman,\n           Plaintiffs lawfully terminated the Agreement in August 2008. Thus, no further obligations are owed or due to Defendants\n           under the Agreement.\n\n           b. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ lawful termination of the Agreement, the Agreement expired on August 1, 2008. The\n           Agreement provides for automatic renewal upon the anniversary date of the contract only if neither party provides written\n           notice to the other party to the contrary. Here, Defendants’ Agreement Termination Letter was received by Plaintiffs in\n           May of 2008, and the Agreement expired by its own terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.\n\n           c.

See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i). The burden then\n\nshifts to the nonmovant to produce more than a scintilla of summary judgment evidence that\n\nraises a genuine issue of material fact as to each essential element identified in the motion. Id.;\n\nTimpte Indus., Inc., 286 S.W.3d at 310. More than a scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence\n\nwould allow reasonable and fair-minded people to reach the verdict under review. See City of\n\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 127.\n\n       In a traditional summary judgment, the party moving for summary judgment has the\n\nburden to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law.

Breach of Contract Claim Asserted by JBBI and TBC\n\n        We begin with appellants’ second issue, in which they contend “the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment on [a]ppellees’ claim for breach of contract because it applied an\n\nincorrect measure of damages and there was no evidence of recoverable damages.” According to\n\nappellants, “the evidence of damages was legally insufficient because the evidence represented\n\noverpayments that occurred for approximately three months after the alleged breach and thus\n\ncaused the trial court to utilize an improper measure of damages (an incorrect time period).”\n\nAdditionally, appellants assert in their reply brief in this Court that “[appellees’] only damage\n\nevidence relates to amounts that are not recoverable, rendering their evidence legally\n\ninsufficient.”\n\n        Appellees respond (1) appellants “failed to object or otherwise raise to the trial court any\n\nallegation that the measure of damages provided by [a]ppellees was somehow improper” and\n\ntherefore waived the alleged error, (2) appellants “ignore [a]ppellees’ right to elect to continue to\n\n                                               –12–\n\fperform under the Agreement” and “sue for damages as they accrue when the time for\n\nperformance under the contract is due,” and (3) “[a]ppellants’ arguments that [a]ppellees could\n\nnot ‘create or increase’ their damages are actually arguing a failure to mitigate,” an affirmative\n\ndefense that appellants did not plead.\n\n       “A successful breach of contract claim requires proof of the following elements: (1) a\n\nvalid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the\n\ncontract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach.”\n\nPetras v. Criswell, 248 S.W.3d 471, 477 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.); see Barnett v.\n\nCoppell N. Tex. Court, Ltd., 123 S.W.3d 804, 815 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied).\n\n“Where damages evidence does not relate to the amount of damages sustained under the proper\n\nmeasure of damages, that evidence is both irrelevant and legally insufficient to support a\n\njudgment.” De Escabedo v. Haygood, 283 S.W.3d 3, 6 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2009), aff’d sub nom.,\n\n356 S.W.3d 390 (Tex. 2011).\n\n       The record does not show appellants objected to the evidence respecting the measure of\n\ndamages or otherwise raised that issue in the trial court. However, “a party may challenge the\n\nlegal sufficiency of the evidence even in the absence of any objection to its admissibility.”\n\nCoastal Transp. Co., Inc. v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., 136 S.W.3d 227, 233 (Tex. 2004).\n\nFurther, an attack on the legal sufficiency of the grounds expressly raised by the movant in his\n\nmotion for summary judgment is an exception to the general rule that “[i]ssues not expressly\n\npresented to the trial court by written motion, answer, or other response shall not be considered\n\non appeal as grounds for reversal.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); see McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 343;\n\nClear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at 676–77. Therefore, we conclude appellants did not\n\nwaive error pertaining to the legal sufficiency of the evidence respecting breach of contract\n\ndamages.\n\n                                              –13–\n\f       In support of their assertion that the proper measure of damages was applied in this case,\n\nappellees state “when one party repudiates a contract, the other party may then elect to ‘treat the\n\nrepudiation as inoperative and sue for damages as they accrue when the time for performance\n\nunder the contract is due.’” (quoting America’s Favorite Chicken Co. v. Samaras, 929 S.W.2d\n\n617, 626 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1996, writ denied)). Appellees contend they (1) “elected to\n\ncontinue the Agreement in force in an effort to have [a]ppellants resume performance and\n\ntherefore continued to make payments” and (2) “are entitled to recover the $291,666.67 paid\n\nduring the time of [a]ppellants’ non-performance under the Agreement.”\n\n       Appellants cite the following statement of law in support of their position: “A party,\n\nwhile in the performance of a contract, when served with notice of its repudiation by the other\n\nparty, cannot proceed with the performance of the contract except it be one of which specific\n\nperformance may be enforced and increase the damages to which he would otherwise be\n\nentitled.” Osage Oil & Ref. Co. v. Lee Farm Oil Co., 230 S.W. 518, 522 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nAmarillo 1921, writ ref’d). According to appellants, (1) the Agreement was a contract for\n\nservices and therefore was not subject to specific performance and (2) appellees were not entitled\n\nto recover “overpayments that occurred for approximately three months after the alleged\n\nbreach.”\n\n       During oral argument before this Court, appellees contended (1) the rule quoted above\n\nfrom Osage Oil “has not been followed by a single court” and (2) current case law allows a non-\n\nrepudiating party to choose to treat the contract as continuing regardless of whether specific\n\nperformance is available. In support of those arguments, appellees cited three cases. See Bumb\n\nv. Intercomp Tech., L.L.C., 64 S.W.3d 123 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, no pet.);\n\nAvasthi & Assoc., Inc. v. Dronamraju, No. 01-11-00786-CV, 2012 WL 6644873 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Dec. 20, 2012, pet. denied) (mem. op.); C.K. Oil Props., Inc. v. Hrubetz\n\n                                              –14–\n\fOperating Co., No. 11-99-00066-CV, 2002 WL 32344609 (Tex. App.—Eastland Apr. 25, 2002,\n\nno pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\n       In C.K. Oil, Hrubetz Operating Company (“HOPCO”) contracted to operate certain gas\n\nand oil leases. C.K. Oil, 2002 WL 32344609, at *1. Subsequently, a working interest in the\n\nleases was conveyed to C.K. Oil Properties, Inc. (“C.K.”). Id. C.K. informed HOPCO that\n\nHOPCO was terminated as operator and advised HOPCO that C.K. would not reimburse\n\nHOPCO for any operating expenses incurred after November 10, 1997. Id. HOPCO continued\n\nto operate the leases. Id. Additionally, HOPCO filed suit against C.K. to specifically enforce the\n\nterms of its contract and sought damages from C.K. as a result of the attempted termination. Id.\n\nat *2. Those damages included expenses for operating the leases from the date of the purported\n\ntermination through the date of trial. Id. C.K. counterclaimed for trespass, asserting HOPCO\n\nwas liable to C.K. in tort for refusing to accept C.K.’s breach of the contract. Id. The trial court\n\ngranted a motion by C.K. for partial summary judgment denying specific performance and the\n\nremaining issues were tried before a jury. Id. The jury found in favor of HOPCO and awarded\n\nHOPCO damages that included its expenses incurred in operating the leases after the date of the\n\npurported termination. Id. On appeal, C.K. argued in part that pursuant to the rule stated in\n\nOsage Oil, HOPCO was (1) required to accept C.K.’s repudiation and (2) not entitled to recover\n\nany damages for expenses incurred in operating the lease after the date of the purported\n\ntermination. Id. at *8, *14. The Eleventh District Court of Appeals in Eastland disagreed with\n\nC.K. Id. The court stated that the “damage rule” announced in Osage Oil “does not apply to\n\naffirmative claims for relief which a repudiating party asserts against the non-breaching party for\n\nfailing to accept the breach.” Id. at *8. Therefore, the court concluded, HOPCO was “not\n\nrequired to accept C.K.’s repudiation.” Id. Further, in considering HOPCO’s claim for damages,\n\nthe court stated in part, “For the same reasons that we have rejected the ruling in Osage Oil as\n\n                                               –15–\n\fserving as a basis for [C.K.’s] counterclaims sounding in tort, we do not find Osage Oil to be\n\ncontrolling on the issue of HOPCO’s damages.” Id. at *14. The court concluded, “Because the\n\nruling in Osage Oil directly conflicts with the non-breaching party’s option of treating the\n\nrepudiation as inoperative, we decline to apply Osage Oil to the facts of this case.” Id.\n\n       Unlike the case before us, C.K. Oil involved not only a non-repudiating party claiming\n\ndamages, but also a repudiating party seeking to use the rule in Osage Oil to profit from its own\n\nbreach. See id. at *8. We cannot agree with appellees that the C.K. Oil court’s conclusion that\n\nOsage Oil was not controlling on the facts of that case supports appellees’ position that Osage\n\nOil is inapplicable in the case before us.\n\n       Bumb involved an employee, John W. Bumb, whose employment contract provided that\n\neither he or his employer, InterComp Technologies, L.L.C. (“InterComp”), could terminate their\n\nrelationship at will by giving ninety days’ notice. Bumb, 64 S.W.3d at 124. On August 4, 1995,\n\nInterComp notified Bumb that his employment was terminated effective November 3, 1995. Id.\n\nOn September 25, 1995, InterComp allegedly told Bumb that it would no longer pay his salary or\n\nreimburse him for expenses.       Id.   However, Bumb continued to perform his duties until\n\nNovember 3, 1995. Id. On October 12, 1995, Bumb downloaded copies of InterComp software\n\nin violation of his employment contract. Id. Almost four years later, Bumb filed suit against\n\nInterComp for unpaid salary and expenses. Id. Intercomp moved for summary judgment,\n\nalleging it was excused from further performance under the contract when Bumb breached the\n\ncontract by downloading software. Id. In response, Bumb claimed InterComp breached the\n\ncontract first by orally repudiating the contract on September 25, 1995, and by failing to pay his\n\nsalary and expenses on October 1, 1995. Id. The trial court granted InterComp’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 125. The Fourteenth District Court of Appeals in Houston affirmed,\n\nstating “an anticipatory repudiation gives the nonrepudiating party the option to treat the\n\n                                               –16–\n\frepudiation as a breach, or ignore it and await the agreed upon time of performance.” Id. The\n\ncourt reasoned that “by waiting to sue until after InterComp’s performance was due, Bumb was\n\nobligated to continue performing under the contract, and any breach on his own part prior to the\n\nNovember 3, 1995 termination date excused InterComp from further performance.”               Id.\n\nTherefore, the court concluded, Bumb’s October 12, 1995 breach barred his suit for any breaches\n\nby InterComp thereafter. Id. As to breaches by InterComp prior to October 12, 1995, the court\n\nobserved that the contract provided Bumb’s monthly salary was payable “in arrears.” Id. Thus,\n\npayment for Bumb’s services during October was not due until November 1, 1995, a date after\n\nBumb’s October 12, 1995 breach of contract. Id. Further, as to Bumb’s claim for expenses, the\n\ncourt observed that the contract required “appropriate support” before expenses would be\n\nreimbursed. Id. The court stated there was no proof the required support had been provided to\n\nIntercomp until a date after Bumb’s October 12, 1995 breach. Id.\n\n       Appellees assert Bumb demonstrates that the rule of Osage Oil is not currently the law in\n\ncases involving contracts for services. However, the court in Bumb did not specifically address\n\nthe issue of whether, when a contract is repudiated, the non-repudiating party can “increase the\n\ndamages to which he would otherwise be entitled” by continuing to perform. See Osage Oil, 230\n\nS.W. at 522. We cannot agree with appellees that Bumb supports their position that Osage Oil is\n\ninapplicable to the case before us.\n\n       Finally, in Avasthi, Sharma Dronamraju contracted with a petroleum consulting\n\ncompany, Avasthi & Associates, Inc. (“A & A”), to provide geological services for a specific\n\nproject. Avasthi, 2012 WL 6644873 at *1. The contract contained detailed reporting and billing\n\nrequirements. Id. It was undisputed that Dronamraju “never timely complied” with those\n\nrequirements during the ten-month time period that he worked for A & A. Id. at *2. Despite\n\nsuch noncompliance, A & A paid Dronamraju on numerous occasions and continued to request\n\n                                             –17–\n\fhim to perform work on the project. Id. at *3-4. After the project was completed, A & A\n\ninformed Dronamraju that certain bills for his time “had been submitted too late” and would not\n\nbe paid by A & A. Id. at *3. Dronamraju filed suit against A & A for breach of contract,\n\nseeking payment of his unpaid bills. Id. The jury found in favor of Dronamraju. Id. at *4. On\n\nappeal, A & A argued that as a matter of law, it was excused from performing under the contract,\n\ni.e. paying Dronamraju, because of Dronamraju’s prior material breach of the same contract, i.e.\n\nthe failure to timely bill. Id. at *6. The First District Court of Appeals in Houston disagreed. Id.\n\nat *7.    The court concluded that by seeking to continue benefiting from the contract by\n\nrequesting Dronamraju continue performing work, “A & A waived its ability to treat\n\nDronamraju’s breach as a justification for non-performance.” Id. at *8. Unlike the case before\n\nus, Avasthi did not involve a non-repudiating party seeking to recover damages for breach of\n\ncontract after continuing performance. See id. Therefore, that case is inapposite as to whether\n\nOsage Oil applies to such a fact situation.\n\n         As described above, the Agreement stated JBBI was employing BSF “for the purpose of\n\nengaging the full-time services of [Berryman].”           A contract for personal services is not\n\nspecifically enforceable. See Gage v. Wimberly, 476 S.W.2d 724, 731 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler\n\n1972, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Chain v. Pye, 429 S.W.2d 630, 635 (Tex. Civ. App.—Beaumont 1968,\n\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.). Further, appellees assert in their brief on appeal that “[a]s early as the first half\n\nof May of 2008, [a]ppellants altogether ceased performance under the Agreement.” The record\n\nshows that at that point, the $291,666.67 claimed by appellees as breach of contract damages had\n\nnot been paid to appellants. Appellees assert they continued to pay appellants in May, June,\n\nJuly, and August of 2008, even though appellants “never resumed performance under the\n\nAgreement.” Thus, the record shows that absent the continuation of payments by appellees, they\n\nwould not “otherwise be entitled” to the $291,666.67 they claim as breach of contract damages.\n\n                                                 –18–\n\fSee Osage Oil, 230 S.W. at 522. On this record, we conclude those sums are not recoverable as\n\nbreach of contract damages. See id.; see also Tower Contracting Co., Inc. v. Flores, 294 S.W.2d\n\n266, 273 (Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1956), aff’d as modified, 302 S.W.2d 396 (Tex. 1957)\n\n(except in cases where specific performance is proper, non-repudiating party “cannot afterwards\n\ngo on, and thereby increase the damages, and then recover such damages from the other party”).\n\nThe record shows no evidence of other breach of contract damages claimed by appellees.\n\nConsequently, we conclude appellees did not meet their summary judgment burden as to their\n\nbreach of contract claim. See Petras, 248 S.W.3d at 477; Barnett, 123 S.W.3d at 815; see also\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n           We decide in favor of appellants on their second issue. 6\n\n                                                   2. Money Had and Received\n\n           In their third issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on [a]ppellees’ claims for money had and received because recovery is barred by the\n\nvoluntary payment doctrine.”                      Appellees respond in part that this argument fails because\n\nappellants did not plead voluntary payment as an affirmative defense and “did not cite evidence\n\nto or raise the issue of voluntary payment” in their summary judgment response in the trial court.\n\nIn their reply brief in this Court, appellants assert in part (1) “[t]he voluntary payment doctrine is\n\nan equitable estoppel-based defense,” (2) appellants “pled equitable estoppel” in their answer,\n\nand (3) “[b]ecause [plaintiffs] failed to specially except to [defendants’] affirmative defenses,\n\nasserting a general equitable estoppel defense was sufficient to plead the sub-defense of\n\nvoluntary payment.”\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         In their first issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on [a]ppellees’ claim for breach of contract\nbecause [a]ppellees failed to conclusively prove causation.” In light of our disposition of appellants’ second issue, we need not reach appellants’\nfirst issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –19–\n\f        “Money had and received is a category of general assumpsit to restore money where\n\nequity and good conscience require refund.” MGA Ins. Co. v. Charles R. Chesnutt, P.C., 358\n\nS.W.3d 808, 813 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.); accord Edwards v. Mid-Continent Office\n\nDistribs., L.P., 252 S.W.3d 833, 837 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, pet. denied). “A cause of action\n\nfor money had and received is not premised on wrongdoing, but ‘looks only to the justice of the\n\ncase and inquires whether the defendant has received money which rightfully belongs to\n\nanother.’” MGA Ins. Co., 358 S.W.3d at 813 (quoting Amoco Prod. Co. v. Smith, 946 S.W.2d\n\n162, 164 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1997, no writ)). “In short, it is an equitable doctrine applied to\n\nprevent unjust enrichment.” Id. “To prove a claim for money had and received, a plaintiff must\n\nshow that a defendant holds money which in equity and good conscience belongs to him.” Id.\n\n        Under the voluntary payment rule, “‘[m]oney voluntarily paid on a claim of right, with\n\nfull knowledge of all the facts, in the absence of fraud, deception, duress, or compulsion, cannot\n\nbe recovered back merely because the party at the time of payment was ignorant of or mistook\n\nthe law as to his liability.’” BMG Direct Mktg., Inc. v. Peake, 178 S.W.3d 763, 768 (Tex. 2005)\n\n(quoting Pennell v. United Ins. Co., 243 S.W.2d 572, 576 (Tex. 1951)). “The rule is a defense to\n\nclaims asserting unjust enrichment; that is, when a plaintiff sues for restitution claiming a\n\npayment constitutes unjust enrichment, a defendant may respond with the voluntary-payment\n\nrule as a defense.” Id.; see Miga v. Jensen, 299 S.W.3d 98, 103 (Tex. 2009) (voluntary payment\n\nrule is “a defense to a restitution claim”).\n\n        The record shows appellants did not assert the voluntary payment rule as a defense or\n\naddress voluntary payment in their summary judgment response. See BMG Direct Mktg., Inc.,\n\n178 S.W.3d at 768; TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). Further, appellants cite no authority, and we have\n\nfound none, to support their assertion that the voluntary payment rule is a “sub-defense” of a\n\n“general equitable estoppel defense.” Cf. Johnson & Higgins of Tex., Inc. v. Kenneco Energy,\n\n                                               –20–\n\fInc., 962 S.W.2d 507, 515–16 (Tex. 1998) (“[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel requires: (1) a\n\nfalse representation or concealment of material facts; (2) made with knowledge, actual or\n\nconstructive, of those facts; (3) with the intention that it should be acted on; (4) to a party\n\nwithout knowledge or means of obtaining knowledge of the facts; (5) who detrimentally relies on\n\nthe representations.”). We conclude appellants’ third issue presents nothing for this Court’s\n\nreview. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n          We decide against appellants on their third issue. 7\n\n                                          3. Objections to Berryman’s Affidavit\n\n          Next, we address appellants’ ninth issue, in which they assert the trial court “erred in\n\nsustaining [a]ppellees’ objections to [a]ppellants’ summary judgment evidence.” Specifically,\n\nappellants assert the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining appellees’ objections to\n\nBerryman’s affidavit respecting “improper conclusions and opinions,” irrelevant testimony,\n\nhearsay testimony, and lack of required attachments.\n\n          Appellees respond in part that “[a]ppellants waived any alleged error by failing to address\n\nindependent and alternative grounds to exclude evidence.” Specifically, appellees assert in part\n\nthat appellants “nowhere address” appellees’ (1) supplemental objection “to the entirety of\n\nBerryman’s affidavit for failing to be based on personal knowledge” and (2) “objections to\n\nparagraphs 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, and 28 of Berryman’s affidavit as being a sham affidavit\n\nthat directly contradicted his deposition testimony.”\n\n          We review a trial court’s ruling that sustains an objection to summary judgment evidence\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. Cantu v. Horany, 195 S.W.3d 867, 871 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no\n\npet.); Bradford Partners II, L.P. v. Fahning, 231 S.W.3d 513, 521 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, no\n\n     7\n       The record shows that in their motion for summary judgment, appellees requested damages of $333,666.63 in connection with plaintiffs’\nclaim for money had and received. Further, the trial court’s judgment does not show the damages awarded therein are based on a particular\nclaim. Therefore, the record shows plaintiffs’ claim for money had and received, alone, supports the full amount of damages awarded in the\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                                                                  –21–\n\fpet.). “[W]hen an appellee urges several objections to a particular piece of evidence and, on\n\nappeal, the appellant complains of its exclusion on only one of those bases, the appellant has\n\nwaived that issue for appeal because he has not challenged all possible grounds for the trial\n\ncourt’s ruling that sustained the objection.” Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at 871; see Bradford Partners,\n\n231 S.W.3d at 521; Goodenberger v. Ellis, 343 S.W.3d 536, 540 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n       As described above, appellants filed an initial brief and a reply brief in this Court. In\n\nthose briefs, appellants do not address appellees’ objections that portions of Berryman’s affidavit\n\nconstituted a “sham affidavit.” Therefore, we conclude appellants have presented no challenge\n\nin this Court to the trial court’s sustaining of appellees’ “sham affidavit” objections respecting\n\nparagraphs 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, and 28 of Berryman’s affidavit. See Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at\n\n871; Bradford Partners, 231 S.W.3d at 521.\n\n       As to appellees’ objection “to the entirety of Berryman’s affidavit for failing to be based\n\non personal knowledge,” appellants contend in their reply brief in this Court that they “properly\n\naddressed [appellees’] personal knowledge arguments, and therefore, did not waive their right to\n\nargue against them on appeal.” According to appellants, in their initial appellate brief, they (1)\n\n“cite to [Berryman’s] testimony that he was present during his conversations with [Brinkmann]\n\nand certain JBBI employees, and therefore demonstrated he had the personal knowledge\n\nregarding what statements were made during those conversations”; (2) “dedicated an entire\n\nsection of their brief to explaining how the statements of Brinkmann and his employees were not\n\nhearsay because the statements constitute admissions by a party opponent”; and (3) explained\n\n“how [appellees’] own internal business records were the source of [Berryman’s] personal\n\nknowledge.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              –22–\n\f          First, appellants’ citations in their initial appellate brief that purportedly show\n\nBerryman’s “personal knowledge” as to his conversations with Brinkmann and JBBI employees\n\nappear in a section of appellants’ brief addressing objections to “conclusory statements” of\n\nBerryman. The issue of whether Berryman’s “personal knowledge” was based on hearsay was\n\nnot addressed with respect to those statements.\n\n          Second, in the portion of appellants’ initial appellate brief addressing appellees’ hearsay\n\nobjections, appellants assert appellees are “incorrect” that Berryman’s affidavit contained\n\nhearsay. Then, appellants contend, “For one, contrary to [appellees’] arguments, the statements\n\nof people in [appellees’] accounting department that certain submitted reimbursements had been\n\napproved (CR at 712) fall under the hearsay exception for admissions of a party opponent.” In\n\nsupport of that contention, appellants cite Texas Rule of Evidence 801(e)(2)(D). See TEX. R.\n\nEVID. 801(e)(2)(D) (providing hearsay exception for statement by party’s agent or servant\n\nconcerning matter within scope of agency or employment made during existence of relationship).\n\nThe page of the record specifically cited by appellants, page 712, is a page of Berryman’s\n\naffidavit that contains paragraphs 26 and 27 and portions of paragraphs 25 and 28. The only\n\nstatement on that page pertaining to appellees’ “accounting department” reads as follows: “Part\n\nof my claim for breach of contract based on unreimbursed expenses occurred in 2006 and 2007\n\nas well as 2008. I was assured that these reimbursements had been approved by the accounting\n\ndepartment and would be forwarded to me.”                               While rule 801(e)(2)(D) provides a hearsay\n\nexception for certain statements by a “party’s agent or servant,” the page of Berryman’s affidavit\n\ncited by appellants does not state who “assured” Berryman the reimbursements in question had\n\nbeen approved. 8 See Volkswagen of Am., Inc. v. Ramirez, 159 S.W.3d 897, 908 (Tex. 2004)\n\n     8\n       The record shows paragraph 24 of Berryman’s affidavit also addressed approval of reimbursements. However, (1) appellants do not cite\nto paragraph 24 in their appellate argument respecting hearsay and (2) Berryman’s statements in paragraph 24 were among those objected to\npursuant to the “sham affidavit” objections described above.\n\n\n\n                                                                 –23–\n\f(proponent of hearsay has burden to show testimony fits within exception). Appellants do not\n\notherwise cite any “statements of Brinkmann and his employees” that they contend “constitute\n\nadmissions by a party opponent.”\n\n       Finally, in the third portion of appellants’ initial brief to which they direct this Court,\n\nappellants specifically address appellees’ objection that Berryman’s affidavit should be struck\n\nbecause Berryman did not attach required documents pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n166a(f). See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(f) (providing in part that “[s]worn or certified copies of all\n\npapers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto”). Appellants cite the\n\nfollowing statement of Berryman in his affidavit:\n\n       I am personally aware of my own actions since 2001, and the damages claimed by\n       [d]efendants in this action. In addition, I have personal knowledge of the facts set\n       forth below based on my direct conversations with [Brinkmann]; employees of\n       [JBBI]; the business records of [JBBI] . . . ; and the business records of [BSF].\n\nThen, appellants argue that because Berryman “simply identified a source from which his\n\npersonal knowledge was developed” and “does not refer to documents in this paragraph,” he\n\n“was not required to attach documents.” Appellants do not address hearsay in that argument.\n\n       Because the trial court could have granted appellees’ objections to Berryman’s affidavit\n\non grounds not challenged by appellants, we conclude appellants have waived their complaint\n\nthat the trial court erred by sustaining appellees’ objections to their summary judgment evidence.\n\nSee Goodenberger, 343 S.W.3d at 540 (citing Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at 871).\n\n       We decide appellants’ ninth issue against them.\n\n                         4. Appellants’ Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n\n       Now, we address together appellants’ tenth and eleventh issues, in which they assert error\n\nby the trial court in granting summary judgment on their counterclaim for “breach of the\n\nagreement to reimburse expenses.”       Specifically, in their tenth issue, appellants assert the\n\nevidence “raises material questions of fact as to the existence, terms, and breach” of the\n                                               –24–\n\fagreement to reimburse expenses. In their eleventh issue, appellants contend in part that material\n\nfact questions exist pertaining to the applicability of the statute of frauds, including whether the\n\nagreement to reimburse expenses (1) was an immaterial change to the Agreement, (2) “modified\n\nonly the one year renewals of the Agreement,” (3) “was independent of the Agreement,” and (4)\n\nis enforceable under the doctrine of partial performance.\n\n       Appellees respond that “the statute of frauds bars appellants’ expense reimbursement\n\nbreach of contract claim.” Further, appellees argue partial performance does not bar application\n\nof the statute of frauds in this case because appellants waived that defense.\n\n       Under the statute of frauds, certain contracts are not enforceable unless they are in\n\nwriting and signed by the person against whom enforcement of the contract is sought. See TEX.\n\nBUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(a) (West 2009); S & I Mgmt., Inc. v. Sungju Choi, 331 S.W.3d\n\n849, 854 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.). The party pleading the statute of frauds bears the\n\nburden of establishing its applicability. See Kalmus, 390 S.W.3d at 589.\n\n       The statute of frauds applies to, inter alia, “an agreement which is not to be performed\n\nwithin one year from the date of the making of the agreement.” TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 26.01(b)(6). When a promise or agreement, either by its terms or by the nature of the required\n\nacts, cannot be completed within one year, it falls within the statute of frauds and is\n\nunenforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the person to be charged. See id. § 26.01(a),\n\n(b)(6); Kalmus, 390 S.W.3d at 589. If the agreement is capable of being performed within one\n\nyear, it is not within the statute of frauds. Kalmus, 390 S.W.3d at 589 (citing Gerstacker v. Blum\n\nConsulting Eng’rs., Inc., 884 S.W.2d 845, 849 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, writ denied)). The\n\nquestion of whether an agreement falls within the statute of frauds is one of law. See Bratcher v.\n\nDozier, 346 S.W.2d 795, 796 (Tex. 1961); Biko v. Siemens Corp., 246 S.W.3d 148, 159 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied). However, whether the circumstances of a particular case fall\n\n                                               –25–\n\fwithin an exception to the statute of frauds is generally a question of fact. See Kalmus, 390\n\nS.W.3d at 589; Adams v. Petrade Int’l, Inc., 754 S.W.2d 696, 705 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1988, writ denied).\n\n          In deciding whether an agreement is capable of being performed within one year, we\n\ncompare the date of the agreement to the date when the performance under the agreement is to be\n\ncompleted. Kalmus, 390 S.W.3d at 590. If there is a year or more between those two reference\n\npoints, a writing is required to render the agreement enforceable.            Id.   When the date\n\nperformance will be completed cannot be readily ascertained, the law provides that if\n\nperformance could conceivably be completed within one year of the agreement’s making, a\n\nwriting is not required to enforce it. Id.; see also Miller v. Riata Cadillac Co., 517 S.W.2d 773,\n\n775 (Tex. 1974) (“If a contract can, from the terms of the agreement, be performed within one\n\nyear it is not within the Statute of Frauds.”).\n\n          Under the partial performance exception to the statute of frauds, contracts that have been\n\npartly performed, but do not meet the requirements of the statute of frauds, may be enforced in\n\nequity if denial of enforcement would amount to a virtual fraud. Exxon Corp. v. Breezevale Ltd.,\n\n82 S.W.3d 429, 439 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2002, pet. denied). The partial performance must be\n\nunequivocally referable to the agreement and corroborative of the fact that a contract actually\n\nwas made. Id.; Holloway v. Dekkers, 380 S.W.3d 315, 324 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.).\n\nThe performance a party relies on to remove a parol agreement from the statute of frauds “must\n\nbe such as could have been done with no other design than to fulfill the particular agreement\n\nsought to be enforced.” Breezevale, 82 S.W.3d at 439–40. Without such precision, the acts of\n\nperformance do not tend to prove the existence of the parol agreement sought to be enforced. Id.\n\nat 440.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  –26–\n\f       First, we address appellants’ argument in their eleventh issue that the alleged agreement\n\nto reimburse expenses “modified only the one year renewals of the Agreement” and therefore\n\nwas not barred by the statute of frauds. Appellants contend “[e]ven if the statute of frauds\n\ninitially applied to the expense reimbursement agreement as a modification of the 2001\n\nAgreement, an agreement to reimburse expenses can be implied regarding the one year renewals\n\nof the 2001 Agreement that would not be barred by the statute of frauds.” According to\n\nappellants, (1) “[o]nce the initial term of the 2001 Agreement expired, and it automatically\n\nrenewed on an annual basis, it was no longer covered by the statute of frauds because it was\n\ncapable of being performed within a year” and (2) “[l]ikewise, the modification of the 2001\n\nAgreement to allow for expense reimbursement would not be covered by the Statute of Frauds.”\n\nIn support of their argument, appellants cite Garcia v. Karam, 276 S.W.2d 255, 257 (Tex. 1955),\n\nfor the statement that “[i]f neither the portion of the written contract affected by the subsequent\n\nmodification nor the matter encompassed by the modification itself is required by the Statute of\n\nFrauds to be in writing, then the oral modification will not render the contract unenforceable.”\n\nAdditionally, appellants cite Miller for the statement that “contracts that can be performed within\n\none year are not within the Statute of Frauds.” Miller, 517 S.W.2d at 775.\n\n       Garcia involved a purchaser’s action for a seller’s alleged breach of a written contract for\n\nthe sale of realty. Garcia, 276 S.W.2d at 256; see also TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01\n\n(b)(4) (providing contract for sale of real estate is within statute of frauds). The contract\n\nprovided that $20,000 of the purchase price was to be paid by merchandise. Garcia, 276 S.W.2d\n\nat 256. Subsequent to executing the written contract, the parties orally agreed that the seller\n\nwould accept the merchandise without the necessity of taking inventory. Id. The purchaser later\n\nfiled and prevailed in a suit to enforce the contract as modified by the oral agreement. Id. On\n\nappeal to the supreme court, the seller contended the oral modification of the contract was\n\n                                              –27–\n\fprohibited by the statute of frauds because it amounted to a “complete change” of the terms of\n\nthe contract between the parties and was an attempt to “substitute an entirely new consideration”\n\nfor the one required by the writing. Id. The supreme court reasoned, “Had the [plaintiff]\n\ncontracted in writing for the sale of his merchandise for ‘$20,000.00, at invoice’, and\n\nsubsequently agreed orally with the [defendant] to convey without an inventory, the Statute of\n\nFrauds would have been wholly inapplicable.” Id. at 257. The court stated that the oral\n\nmodification did not change the “subject matter of the contract,” but “only the method of\n\nperforming it.” Id. Therefore, the court concluded, the subsequent oral modification of the\n\nwritten contract was valid. Id.\n\n       In Miller, Kenneth F. Miller was employed by Riata Cadillac Co. as a used car manager\n\npursuant to an oral contract.      Miller, 517 S.W.2d at 774.        Miller was terminated after\n\napproximately three and one-half years and filed suit against Riata to enforce the alleged terms\n\nof the oral contract. Id. Riata argued the contract was an unenforceable contract within the\n\nstatute of frauds. Id. On appeal, the supreme court concluded in part that because it was\n\nundisputed that the contract was an “indefinite term employment contract,” it was considered\n\nperformable in one year and therefore was not within the statute of frauds. Id. at 776.\n\n       Unlike the case before us, neither Garcia nor Miller involved a contract with an initial\n\nterm longer than one year followed by automatic annual renewals.             Further, neither case\n\ndiscussed application of the statute of frauds to such a contract. Therefore, we do not find those\n\ncases instructive. Appellants cite no other authority, and we have found none, to support their\n\nposition that “[o]nce the initial term of the 2001 Agreement expired, . . . it was no longer covered\n\nby the statute of frauds because it was capable of being performed within a year.” Cf. Hampton\n\nv. Lum, 544 S.W.2d 839, 841 (Tex. Civ. App.—Texarkana 1976, no writ) (construing lease as\n\n\n\n\n                                               –28–\n\f“demise for twenty-four months” where lease provided for one-year period that automatically\n\nrenewed for another year in the absence of notice).\n\n       As described above, the record shows the Agreement stated it was for “a term of five\n\nyears starting August 1, 2001 and is to be renewed annually thereafter unless either parties [sic]\n\ngives notice in writing 90 days prior to the end of any anniversary date.” Additionally, the\n\nrecord shows (1) Berryman testified in part in his deposition that at approximately the same time\n\nthe Agreement was executed in 2001, he and JBBI entered into an oral agreement that\n\nBerryman’s business expenses would be reimbursed by JBBI and (2) Brinkmann testified JBBI\n\nreimbursed Berryman for various expenses starting in 2001 and continuing until at least 2006.\n\nWe cannot agree with appellants that there is evidence in the record that the alleged modification\n\nof the 2001 Agreement to allow for expense reimbursement was capable of being performed\n\nwithin one year.\n\n       Second, we address appellants’ assertion in their eleventh issue that the statute of frauds\n\ndoes not bar the modification in question because it was “an immaterial change to the\n\nAgreement.” According to appellants, the statute of frauds is applicable to the modification in\n\nthis case only if “the modification materially effects the obligations of the underlying\n\nagreement.” In support of that position, appellants cite a case involving an oral modification to\n\nreduce a real estate brokerage commission in a contract to sell real estate. See Am. Garment\n\nProps., Inc. v. CB Richard Ellis-El Paso, L.L.C., 155 S.W.3d 431, 437 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n2004, no pet.).    However, we concluded above that the alleged modification of the 2001\n\nAgreement to allow for expense reimbursement was not capable of being performed within one\n\nyear. Appellants cite no authority, and we have found none, to support the position that a\n\nmodification not capable of being performed within one year falls outside the statute of frauds if\n\nit constitutes an “immaterial change” to the original contract. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN.\n\n                                              –29–\n\f§ 26.01(b)(6). We cannot agree with appellants that the materiality of the modification in\n\nquestion has any bearing on the application of the statute of frauds in this case.\n\n       Third, appellants contend in their eleventh issue that “[e]ven if the statute of frauds\n\napplies to modifications of the 2001 Agreement, the expense reimbursement agreement\n\nalternatively should be viewed not as a direct modification of the 2001 Agreement, but rather as\n\nindependent of the 2001 Agreement.” According to appellants, because there is no time period\n\nfixed for performing the “independent” expense reimbursement agreement, “it must be treated as\n\ncapable of being performed within a year.”          Therefore, appellants assert, “if the expense\n\nreimbursement agreement is independent of the 2001 Agreement, the statute of frauds would not\n\nbar its enforcement.”\n\n       Appellees contend appellants pleaded and argued in the trial court that “there was an oral\n\nmodification of the written Agreement.” (emphasis original). According to appellees, appellants\n\ndid not assert in the trial court that “the expense reimbursement agreement was a stand alone\n\nagreement” and therefore appellants cannot make that contention for the first time on appeal.\n\nFurther, appellees argue, “even if such an agreement existed, it could not have been performed\n\nwithin one year because it would necessarily correlate to the five (5) year term of the\n\nAgreement.”\n\n       The record shows appellants asserted in their amended response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment that the agreement to pay expenses was an “oral modification” of the\n\nAgreement and/or an “implied in fact modification.” Appellants did not argue in the trial court\n\nthat “the expense reimbursement agreement is independent of the 2001 Agreement.”\n\nConsequently, that argument presents nothing for this Court’s review. See TEX. R. CIV. P.\n\n166a(c); McConnel, 858 S.W.2d at 343; Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at 676–77.\n\n\n\n\n                                                –30–\n\f         Fourth, we address appellants’ argument that the partial performance exception to the\n\nstatute of frauds applies in this case. The record shows that in their amended response to\n\nappellees’ motion for summary judgment in the trial court, appellants asserted “part performance\n\nby the parties takes the Agreement outside the statute of frauds.” In a footnote to that statement,\n\nappellants cited the portion of Breezevale that states the law described above respecting partial\n\nperformance. See 82 S.W.3d at 439. Appellants’ argument as to “part performance” in the trial\n\ncourt contained no other statements, analysis, or citations to authority or to the record.\n\n         “[A] party submitting summary judgment evidence ‘must specifically identify the\n\nsupporting proof on file that it seeks to have considered by the trial court.’” Bich Ngoc Nguyen\n\nv. Allstate Ins. Co., 404 S.W.3d 770, 776 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet. denied) (quoting\n\nArredondo v. Rodriguez, 198 S.W.3d 236, 238 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, no pet.)). On\n\nthis record, we conclude the trial court did not err by concluding appellants did not satisfy their\n\nburden to raise a fact issue as to partial performance. See id. at 777; see also MGA Ins. Co., 358\n\nS.W.3d at 815; TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i).\n\n         Based on the preceding analysis, we conclude the trial court did not err by concluding the\n\nrequirements of the statute of frauds apply to the alleged agreement to reimburse expenses. TEX.\n\nBUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(a), (b)(6). We decide against appellants on their eleventh\n\nissue.\n\n         In their tenth issue, appellants assert that even if the trial court properly excluded\n\nBerryman’s affidavit, the remaining evidence in the record “raises material questions of fact as to\n\nthe existence, terms, and breach” of the agreement to reimburse expenses. In a footnote to their\n\nappellate argument on this issue, appellants contend appellees “err in assuming that the expense\n\nreimbursement agreement must have been in writing.” However, we concluded above that the\n\ntrial court did not err by concluding the expense reimbursement agreement was within the statute\n\n                                                –31–\n\fof frauds. See id. Because the record does not show the expense reimbursement agreement was\n\nin writing and signed by the party to be charged, that agreement is unenforceable.                  Id.\n\nConsequently, the evidence described by appellants has no bearing on whether the trial court\n\nerred in granting summary judgment respecting the agreement to reimburse expenses.\n\n       We decide appellants’ tenth issue against them.\n\n                                      5. Declaratory Judgment\n\n       Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code is titled “Declaratory\n\nJudgments.” See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. §§ 37.001–37.011 (West 2008). Section\n\n37.004 of that chapter provides in part\n\n       A person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings\n       constituting a contract or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected\n       by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise may have determined any\n       question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute,\n       ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other\n       legal relations thereunder.\n\nId. § 37.004(a).\n\n       We review declaratory judgments under the same standards as other judgments.

We look to the procedure used to resolve the issue at trial to\n\ndetermine the standard of review on appeal. Lidawi, 112 S.W.3d at 730. Thus, in the case\n\nbefore us, we review the propriety of the trial court’s declaratory judgment under the same\n\nstandards we apply to a summary judgment. Id.\n\n                                           a. Redundancy\n\n       In their fourth issue, appellants assert “the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n\non [a]ppellees’ declaratory judgment claim because declaratory relief was redundant with\n\n[a]ppellees’ breach of contract claim and therefore barred as a matter of law.” Appellees respond\n\nin part that “[a]ppellants did not object or otherwise argue to the trial court that declaratory relief\n                                                –32–\n\fwas ‘merely redundant or duplicative’ of [a]ppellees’ other claims” and “cannot do so for the\n\nfirst time on appeal.” Appellants argue in their reply brief in this Court that their complaint\n\nrespecting the redundancy of the declaratory judgment claim was not “waived” by their failure to\n\nobject at the trial level because (1) “[a] failure to object is not waiver when error is apparent from\n\nthe face of the record” and (2) “it is apparent from the face of the record that [plaintiffs’] breach\n\nof contract and declaratory judgment claims involve the same issues and resolution of one adds\n\nnothing to the other.”\n\n       In support of their argument that their failure to object did not constitute “waiver,”\n\nappellants cite Coastal Transport Co., Inc. See 136 S.W.3d at 233. However, unlike the case\n\nbefore us, that case involved a no-evidence challenge asserted for the first time on appeal. The\n\nsupreme court concluded in that case that when such a challenge is “restricted to the face of the\n\nrecord (for example, when expert testimony is speculative or conclusory on its face),” a party\n\n“may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the absence of any objection to its\n\nadmissibility.” In the case before us, appellants do not explain, and the record does not show,\n\nhow their complaint respecting redundancy is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.\n\n       On this record, we conclude appellants’ fourth issue presents nothing for this Court’s\n\nreview. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); cf. Narisi v. Legend Diversified Inv., 715 S.W.2d 49, 51–52\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.) (rejecting argument that declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim was redundant where issue was not raised until after judgment was signed); City of\n\nDallas/DISD v. US W. Fin. Servs., Inc., No. 05-92-01106-CV, 1993 WL 147262, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas Apr. 27, 1993, no writ) (not designated for publication) (declining to consider\n\ncomplaint that declaratory judgment claim was “duplicative” as grounds for reversal of summary\n\njudgment because such issue was not raised in trial court).\n\n                                                –33–\n\f           We decide against appellants on their fourth issue.\n\n                               b. Fact Questions Respecting Trial Court’s Declarations\n\n           In their fifth and sixth issues, appellants contend the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on appellees’ declaratory judgment claim because fact questions exist (1) “as to the\n\ntrial court’s declarations” and (2) “concerning whether [a]ppellees’ conduct excused further\n\nperformance by [a]ppellants.” 9\n\n           First, we consider appellants’ assertion in their sixth issue that “any breach by\n\n[appellants] was excused by [appellees’] conduct.” In support of their argument, appellants cite\n\nthe general rule that “performance is excused when a party to a contract prevents the other from\n\nperforming.” See O’Shea v. Int’l Bus. Mach. Corp., 578 S.W.2d 844, 846 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Appellants contend that “[u]nder this general rule,\n\nactions of [appellees] that undermined or interfered with [appellants’] ability to sell or market\n\nproducts excused any alleged breach of such duties because such actions prevented\n\nperformance.” Additionally, appellants cite O’Shea in support of their position that “[a]ny\n\nquestion of fact as to whether [appellees] interfered with [appellants’] performance would\n\npreclude summary judgment.”\n\n           Appellees respond in part that appellants “cite no authority for the proposition that\n\n‘undermining’ or ‘interfering’ are the equivalent of preventing performance.” Further, appellees\n\nargue the trial court “properly disposed of appellants’ attempt to excuse their breach as a matter\n\nof law” because “[a]ppellees presented to the trial court undisputed evidence that [a]ppellants\n\nwere at all times able to perform despite the actions [a]ppellants want to complain about.”\n\n\n\n     9\n        Additionally, appellants assert in part in their sixth issue that summary judgment on appellees’ breach of contract claim was precluded by\nfact issues respecting whether appellants’ performance was excused. However, we concluded in our analysis pertaining to issue two above that\nthe trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on their breach of contract claim. Therefore, we need not address the\nportion of appellants’ sixth issue pertaining to appellees’ breach of contract claim.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –34–\n\f       The court in O’Shea did not address the question of whether evidence that a party\n\n“interfered” with performance constitutes evidence that performance was prevented. See 578\n\nS.W.2d at 846. Appellants cite no other authority, and we have found none, in support of their\n\nposition that “[a]ny question of fact as to whether [appellees] interfered with [appellants’]\n\nperformance would preclude summary judgment.” In support of their argument that the evidence\n\nraises a fact question as to whether appellants’ performance of the Agreement was “prevented,”\n\nappellants cite portions of (1) Berryman’s affidavit and (2) the depositions of Berryman and\n\nBrinkmann.    We concluded above that the trial court did not err by sustaining appellees’\n\nobjection to Berryman’s affidavit. Therefore, we do not consider that affidavit in our analysis.\n\nThe excerpts from Berryman’s deposition cited by appellants include Berryman’s testimony that\n\n(1) during two separate meetings in 2006 and 2008, Brinkmann stated in front of retailers’\n\nrepresentatives that Berryman “didn’t work” and buyers did not want to do business with\n\nBerryman; (2) in approximately April 2008, JBBI hired Mike Bush; and (3) at the time Bush was\n\nhired, Bush told Berryman that Berryman was “being replaced” by Bush.              Additionally,\n\nappellants cite deposition testimony of Brinkmann respecting the hiring of Bush.\n\n       The record shows Berryman testified in his deposition that he was still able to perform\n\nhis duties under the Agreement after the negative comments made by Brinkmann in 2006 and\n\n2008. Therefore, we cannot conclude those comments prevented Berryman’s performance. In\n\ntheir reply brief in this Court, appellants assert that even if the “defamatory statements” of\n\nBrinkmann did not prevent performance, appellees “wholly frustrated [appellants’] ability to\n\nperform” because they “effectively eliminated [Berryman’s] position” by hiring Bush and\n\n“wresting away [Berryman’s] authority to act on his accounts.”        However, the deposition\n\ntestimony cited by appellants does not show Berryman’s performance was prevented by the\n\nhiring of Bush. Further, Berryman testified in his deposition that he was not replaced by Bush.\n\n                                             –35–\n\fOn this record, we cannot conclude the evidence raises a fact question as to whether appellants’\n\nperformance of the Agreement was “excused.”\n\n           We decide against appellants on their sixth issue.\n\n           As to the trial court’s four declarations in the judgment, all are challenged by appellants.\n\nHowever, in light of our conclusions above, appellants’ arguments respecting the trial court’s\n\ndeclaration “c” need not be addressed. 10 Consequently, we address only appellants’ challenges\n\nrespecting the following declarations:\n\n           a. Defendants ceased performing under the Agreement in, at least, May of 2008\n           when Berryman refused to fulfill his duties and obligations for Plaintiffs. This\n           constituted a material breach of the Agreement. The Agreement was at a\n           minimum terminable from that point forward by Plaintiffs, and after making every\n           reasonable effort to communicate with Berryman, Plaintiffs lawfully terminated\n           the Agreement in August 2008. Thus, no further obligations are owed or due to\n           Defendants under the Agreement.\n\n           b. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ lawful termination of the Agreement, the\n           Agreement expired on August 1, 2008. The Agreement provides for automatic\n           renewal upon the anniversary date of the contract only if neither party provides\n           written notice to the other party to the contrary. Here, Defendants’ Agreement\n           Termination Letter was received by Plaintiffs in May of 2008, and the Agreement\n           expired by its own terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.\n           ....\n           d. JBBI did not, constructively or otherwise, breach the Agreement.\n\n           With respect to declaration “a,” appellants argue they “presented evidence that the 2001\n\nAgreement had already been constructively terminated by [appellees’] conduct that undermined\n\nand interfered with [appellants’] performance of the contract.” According to appellants, “[t]his\n\nevidence raised a fact question as to whether [appellees] breached the agreement, which should\n\nhave prevented the trial court from entering summary judgment and making the above\n\ndeclaration.”\n\n     10\n         Specifically, appellants contend the trial court’s declaration “c” was issued in error because “[t]he existence of fact questions surrounding\nthe partial performance doctrine and the modification of the 2001 Agreement’s one year extensions prevented [appellees] from conclusively\nproving that the oral agreements [to reimburse expenses] were not part of the 2001 Agreement.” We concluded in the analysis above pertaining\nto issue eleven that the trial court did not err by concluding no fact questions existed as to partial performance and “modification of the 2001\nAgreement’s one year extensions.”\n\n\n\n                                                                       –36–\n\f       Appellees respond in part that appellants’ argument respecting “constructive termination”\n\nis waived because appellants “do not cite or analyze any cases in alleged support of their\n\ncontention that constructive termination principles apply in non-employment contract cases or, if\n\nsuch did apply, connecting evidence to elements of constructive termination to demonstrate the\n\nexistence of a fact issue.” Additionally, appellees contend “[t]he evidence is uncontroverted that\n\nworking conditions did not force [a]ppellants to stop performing, and that [a]ppellants did not\n\n‘resign’ or stop performance when the alleged offending incidents occurred, such being\n\nrequirements of a constructive discharge claim in the employment context.”\n\n       In their reply brief in this Court, appellants contend appellees’ allegations of “waiver” fail\n\nfor two reasons. First, appellants assert appellees “misunderstand the point” of appellants’\n\nargument. Specifically, appellants assert “[t]he ‘constructive termination’ language was loosely\n\nused to argue that [appellees] breached before [appellants’] alleged breach, and therefore, the\n\nfurther performance by [appellants] was excused.” Appellants contend they “presented summary\n\njudgment evidence that [appellees] breached before [May 2008] by engaging in conduct that\n\nundermined and interfered with [appellants’] performance of the contract.” In support of that\n\nassertion, appellants cite the same evidence cited by them in their argument pertaining to\n\nprevention of performance in their sixth issue above. To the extent appellants assert an argument\n\ndistinct from their argument pertaining to their sixth issue, appellants do not provide analysis or\n\nauthority for such argument. Therefore, such argument presents nothing for this Court’s review.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Second, appellants assert in their reply brief that “there is no merit to\n\n[appellees’] contention that ‘constructive termination’ is a concept limited to application in the\n\nemployment context.” According to appellants, “constructive termination is a concept that is\n\nrecognized in many types of relationships.” In support of that assertion, appellants cite cases that\n\npurportedly relate to constructive termination in the contexts of franchise agreements, licensing\n\n                                                –37–\n\fagreements, and leases.                 However, appellants do not address the elements of constructive\n\ntermination in their briefs in this Court or explain how appellees’ alleged conduct in question\n\nconstituted constructive termination.                          Consequently, we conclude appellants’ argument\n\nrespecting constructive termination presents nothing for this Court’s review. 11 See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 38.1(i).\n\n           As to declaration “d,” appellants contend that declaration was issued in error because\n\nappellants “presented evidence that raised a fact question as to [appellees’] breach of the 2001\n\nAgreement by undermining and interfering with [appellants’] performance.” In support of that\n\nargument, appellants cite to their analysis pertaining to their sixth issue and the evidence cited\n\ntherein. However, again, to the extent appellants assert an argument distinct from their argument\n\npertaining to their sixth issue, appellants do not provide analysis or authority for such argument\n\nand therefore present nothing for this Court’s review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n           As to the trial court’s declaration “b,” appellants contend they presented evidence that\n\nraises fact questions as to the termination of the Agreement. Specifically, appellants assert\n\n           [T]he evidence shows that the termination provision requires 90 days’ notice for\n           any termination. Otherwise the 2001 Agreement automatically renews. It is\n           undisputed that 90 days’ notice was not provided by either party. Thus, under the\n           express terms of the 2001 Agreement no termination occurred. At the very least, a\n           fact question exists that should have prevented the trial court from making this\n           declaration.\n\n(citations to record omitted).\n\n           Appellees respond in part that because appellants “cite and analyze no cases for their\n\nposition that the Agreement did not expire in August 2008 as determined,” that argument is\n\nwaived. Additionally, appellees assert (1) “[a]ppellants’ Termination Letter sent 72 days prior\n\nto renewal when coupled with [a]ppellants’ failure to resume performance of the Agreement\n\n    11\n         In oral argument before this Court, counsel for appellants asserted the Agreement was terminated according to its terms on August 29,\n2008.\n\n\n\n                                                                   –38–\n\fprecluded automatic renewal as [a]ppellees under such circumstances are not obligated to require\n\n[a]ppellants to comply with the Agreement’s notice provision”; (2) [a]ppellants’ breach\n\nprecluded the Agreement’s renewal”; and (3) “[n]o fact questions could exist on this point in any\n\nevent” because “[t]he meaning of contract language is a question of law for the court.” In\n\nsupport of their argument, appellees cite cases pertaining to waiver of contract provisions and\n\ncessation of performance due to breach. See Long Trusts v. Griffin, 222 S.W.3d 412, 415–16\n\n(Tex. 2006); Guzman v. Ugly Duckling Car Sales of Tex., L.L.P., 63 S.W.3d 522, 528 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 2001, pet. denied); Roma Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Ewing Constr. Co., No. 04-12-\n\n00035-CV, 2012 WL 3025927, at *2 (Tex. App.—San Antonio July 25, 2012, no pet.) (mem.\n\nop.); Atkinson v. Saddlewood Partners I, Ltd., No. 04-98-00681-CV, 1999 WL 371285, at *4\n\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio June 9, 1999, pet. denied) (not designated for publication).\n\n       In their reply brief in this Court, appellants contend in part that “[n]o case law is\n\nnecessary” to resolve this issue in their favor because “it is apparent on the face of the record that\n\nno evidence supports the trial court’s declaration that ‘the Agreement expired by its own terms\n\non August 1, 2008.’”\n\n       Because appellants’ argument is based on the language of the Agreement, we cannot\n\nagree with appellees that appellants waived this argument by not citing case law. Further, the\n\ncases cited by appellees in support of their argument do not involve compliance with a contract\n\nprovision respecting notice that precludes automatic renewal of the contract. Therefore, we do\n\nnot find those cases instructive.\n\n       The record shows paragraph three of the Agreement stated in part, “This Agreement is\n\nfor a term of five years starting August 1, 2001 and is to be renewed annually thereafter unless\n\neither parties [sic] gives notice in writing 90 days prior to the end of any anniversary date.”\n\nBerryman’s letter alleging he had been “constructively terminated” was dated May 20, 2008,\n\n                                                –39–\n\fwhich the parties do not dispute is less than ninety days prior to August 1, 2008. Thus, while the\n\ntrial court’s statement that “Defendants’ Agreement Termination Letter was received by\n\nPlaintiffs in May of 2008” is not incorrect, we cannot agree that “the Agreement expired by its\n\nown terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.” We conclude no evidence supports the trial court’s\n\ndeclaration “b.”\n\n           We decide in favor of appellants on the portion of their fifth issue respecting the trial\n\ncourt’s declaration “b.” Appellants’ fifth issue is otherwise decided against them. We reverse\n\ndeclaration “b” of the trial court’s judgment and render judgment denying summary judgment as\n\nto that declaration.\n\n           However, the record shows (1) the summary judgment in question was sought and\n\ngranted on multiple grounds and (2) declaration “b” is immaterial to summary judgment as\n\nprayed for by appellees on the ground of money had and received and declarations “a,” “c,” and\n\n“d.” Therefore, the trial court’s error respecting declaration “b” does not necessitate reversal of\n\nthe entirety of the trial court’s summary judgment. See Zimmerhanzel, 346 S.W.3d at 724; see\n\nalso TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1.\n\n                                                          6. Attorneys’ Fees\n\n           In their seventh issue, appellants assert in part “the trial court erred in awarding\n\n[a]ppellees attorneys’ fees when [a]ppellees failed to conclusively prove the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of the claimed fees by not segregating fees incurred for work on causes of action for\n\nwhich such fees are permitted, from causes of action for which such fees are barred.” 12\n\nAccording to appellants, (1) “because [appellees’] cause of action for breach of contract fails, the\n\ntrial court’s award of attorneys’ fees cannot be based on that action,” (2) “[i]t is undisputed that\n\n     12\n        Additionally, appellants contend in their seventh issue that “[a]ppellees’ redundant declaratory judgment action was used simply to pave\na way to attorney fees.” As described above, appellants’ arguments respecting the redundancy of the declaratory judgment action were not raised\nbelow and present nothing for this Court’s review.\n\n\n\n                                                                    –40–\n\f[appellees] presented no evidence segregating the fees incurred in pursuing their claims,” and (3)\n\nno attempt was made to segregate attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing third-party claims asserted\n\nby Brinkmann, individually, that were later nonsuited.\n\n       Appellees contend appellants “waived any complaint” respecting segregation of\n\nattorneys’ fees because they “did not object to [a]ppellees’ attorneys’ fees evidence or provide\n\ncontroverting evidence.” Further, appellees argue, counsel for appellees testified to the trial\n\ncourt “in great detail” in his affidavit, “including segregating 15 percent of the attorney’s fees\n\nincurred.”\n\n       Texas law does not allow recovery of attorneys’ fees unless authorized by statute or\n\ncontract. See, e.g., Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 310 (Tex. 2006). A\n\nperson may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees from an individual or corporation, in addition to\n\nthe amount of a valid claim and costs, if the claim is for an oral or written contract. TEX. CIV.\n\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8); see Ashford Partners, Ltd. v. ECO Res., Inc., 401 S.W.3d\n\n35, 40 (Tex. 2012) (“[T]o qualify for fees under [section 38.001(8)], a litigant must prevail on a\n\nbreach of contract claim and recover damages.”). Additionally, under section 37.009 of the civil\n\npractice and remedies code, the trial court in a declaratory judgment proceeding may award\n\n“reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.\n\nCODE ANN. § 37.009; see also Jarvis v. Rocanville Corp., 298 S.W.3d 305, 317 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2009, pet. denied).\n\n       If any attorneys’ fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a\n\nclaimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees. Tony Gullo Motors, 212 S.W.3d\n\nat 313. “[I]t is only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and unrecoverable\n\nclaim that they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at 313–14. This\n\nstandard does not require more precise proof for attorneys’ fees than for any other claims or\n\n                                              –41–\n\fexpense. Id. at 314. “[T]o meet a party’s burden to segregate its attorneys’ fees, it is sufficient\n\nto submit to the fact-finder testimony from a party’s attorney concerning the percentage of hours\n\nthat related solely to a claim for which fees are not recoverable.” RM Crowe Prop. Servs. Co.,\n\nL.P. v. Strategic Energy, L.L.C., 348 S.W.3d 444, 453 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, no pet.); see CA\n\nPartners v. Spears, 274 S.W.3d 51, 82 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied).\n\n       We concluded above that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on\n\nplaintiffs’ breach of contract claim. Therefore, attorneys’ fees based on that cause of action\n\ncannot be recovered. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001(8). However, as\n\ndescribed above, appellants’ issues pertaining to declarations “a,” “c,” and “d” in the final\n\njudgment are decided against them in this appeal. Therefore, a basis for recovery of attorneys’\n\nfees remains. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009.\n\n       The record shows that in an affidavit in the appendix to appellees’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, counsel for appellees testified in part (1) at least 85%, or $127,073, of the attorneys’\n\nfees and paralegal fees incurred by plaintiffs so far “are recoverable against the [d]efendants in\n\nthis lawsuit”; (2) “it is reasonable to conclude that [plaintiffs’] counsel’s activities cannot all be\n\nsegregated by task and as such are dependent on the same or similar sets of facts and\n\ncircumstances, are part of many of the same tasks, and are therefore so intertwined that they\n\ncannot be so separated or segregated” (3) a fair estimate of additional attorneys’ fees likely be\n\nincurred by plaintiffs through the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment to\n\nadvance plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims” against defendants is at least $33,875; and (4) in the\n\nevent of appeal respecting plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims,” plaintiffs will likely incur at least an\n\nadditional $35,000 in fees in defense of an appeal to the Dallas Court of Appeals, $20,000 in fees\n\nin briefing an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, and $15,000 in fees if the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt grants a hearing on such appeal. Appellants did not object to this evidence or provide\n\n                                                –42–\n\fcontroverting evidence respecting segregation of attorneys’ fees. On this record, we conclude\n\nappellees met their burden as to segregation of attorneys’ fees. See Tony Gullo Motors, 212\n\nS.W.3d at 313–14; RM Crowe Prop.

Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997) (“if no one objects to the fact that the attorney’s\n\nfees are not segregated as to specific claims, then the objection is waived”).\n\n           We decide against appellants on their seventh issue. 13\n\n                  7. Damages, Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Interest Awarded to Brinkmann\n\n           Lastly, in their eighth issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in entering judgment\n\nin favor of [Brinkmann], individually, when he did not recover on any cause of action.”\n\nAppellants assert that at the time the final judgment was entered, Brinkmann “was not a party to\n\nthe affirmative causes of action on which judgment was entered.” According to appellants,\n\n“[t]he trial court’s judgment must be reversed because it awarded damages, attorneys’ fees, costs\n\nand interest to an individual who was not a party to any cause of action on which those amounts\n\nwere awarded.”\n\n           Appellees “agree that the final judgment should be modified so Brinkmann individually\n\nis removed from the award of damages or fees because he never requested that relief.”\n\nSpecifically, appellees contend in a footnote in their appellate brief\n\n           The Final Judgment provides for recovery of damages and fees to “Movants”\n           collectively, which was a defined term that included both Plaintiffs/Appellees as\n           well as Third Party Defendant/Brinkmann individually. Brinkmann was not a\n           party to the Agreement, or any alleged oral agreements with Appellants and did\n           not assert breach of Agreement or declaratory judgment claims in any pleading or\n\n     13\n         This Court has stated that “after a declaratory judgment is reversed on appeal, an award of attorneys’ fees may no longer be equitable and\njust.” SAVA gumarska in kemijska industria d.d. v. Advanced Polymer Sciences, Inc., 128 S.W.3d 304, 324 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.).\n“Therefore, when we reverse a declaratory judgment and the trial court awarded attorneys’ fees to the party who prevailed at trial, we may\nremand the attorneys’ fee award for reconsideration in light of our disposition on appeal.” Id. “We are not required to do so, however.” Id.; see\nCity of Temple v. Taylor, 268 S.W.3d 852, 858 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, pet. denied). In the case before us, the outcome in the trial court as to\nthe declaratory judgment is not substantially affected by our conclusions above. Therefore, we conclude reconsideration of attorneys’ fees is not\nwarranted in this case. See Advanced Polymer Sciences, Inc., 128 S.W.3d at 324; Taylor, 268 S.W.3d at 858; cf. Funes v. Villatoro, 352 S.W.3d\n200, 217 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, pet. denied) (where reversal of portion of declaratory relief “substantially affects” trial court’s\njudgment, remand as to attorneys’ fees is warranted).\n\n\n\n                                                                     –43–\n\f           as a part of Appellees’ and Brinkmann’s summary judgment motion. Appellants’\n           third party claims of defamation and business disparagement asserted against\n           Appellees and Brinkmann were dismissed by the trial court and not raised on\n           appeal. Brinkmann non-suited his affirmative claims against Appellants.\n\n(citations to record omitted). 14 However, appellees assert, “[a]ppellants’ desire to reverse the\n\nentire judgment due to this correctable inadvertent drafting error is not authorized or required.”\n\nAccording to appellees, “[a]ppellants’ request beyond deleting the award of damages and fees to\n\nBrinkmann individually should be denied.”\n\n           Under rule 559 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, “[t]he successful party in the suit\n\nshall recover his costs, except in cases where it is otherwise expressly provided.” See TEX. R.\n\nCIV. P. 559. Further, section 304.003(a) of the Texas Finance Code provides in part that “[a]\n\nmoney judgment of a court of this state . . . , including court costs awarded in the judgment and\n\nprejudgment interest, if any, earns postjudgment interest at the rate determined under this\n\nsection.” TEX. FIN. CODE ANN. § 304.003(a) (West 2006); see Dallas Cnty., Tex. v. Crestview\n\nCorners Car Wash, 370 S.W.3d 25, 50 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied) (postjudgment\n\ninterest accrues on entire amount of final judgment, including court costs and prejudgment\n\ninterest, from date of judgment until paid).\n\n           The record shows that at the time the final judgment in this case was signed, Brinkmann\n\nwas a third-party defendant as to appellants’ claims for business disparagement, defamation, and\n\nexemplary damages and had requested costs of court respecting those claims in his answer in the\n\ntrial court. The trial court granted summary judgment against appellants on those claims and\n\nthose claims were dismissed and not raised on appeal. However, the record also shows (1)\n\nBrinkmann was not a party to the affirmative causes of action on which judgment was rendered,\n\n\n\n     14\n         With respect to the “affirmative claims” of Brinkmann described by appellees, the record shows that after Brinkmann was named as a\nthird-party defendant, he asserted several claims not relevant to this appeal against appellants in the trial court, then nonsuited those claims prior\nto the time the trial court’s judgment was rendered.\n\n\n\n                                                                       –44–\n\fi.e. breach of contract, money had and received, and declaratory judgment and (2) the trial\n\ncourt’s awards of damages, attorneys’ fees, and prejudgment interest pertain to those claims.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude all recoveries in favor of Brinkmann except costs of court and interest\n\non such costs cannot stand. 15 See TEX. R. CIV. P. 301 (judgment of trial court shall conform to\n\npleadings).\n\n           We reverse the portions of the trial court’s judgment (1) granting summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Brinkmann on the claims asserted by JBBI and TBC for breach of contract, money had\n\nand received, and declaratory judgment and (2) awarding Brinkmann damages, attorneys’ fees,\n\nprejudgment interest, and postjudgment interest on items other than costs of court. Additionally,\n\nwe render judgment omitting Brinkmann from (1) the portion of the summary judgment\n\nrespecting the claims asserted by JBBI and TBC for breach of contract, money had and received,\n\nand declaratory judgment and (2) the award of damages, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest,\n\nand postjudgment interest on items other than costs of court. See TEX. R. APP. P. 43.2(c)\n\n(providing appellate court may reverse trial court’s judgment in part and render judgment trial\n\ncourt should have rendered). Appellants’ eighth issue is otherwise decided against them.\n\n                                                         III. CONCLUSION\n\n           We decide in favor of appellants on their second issue and portions of their fifth and\n\neighth issues. We need not reach appellants’ first issue. Appellants’ remaining issues are\n\ndecided against them.\n\n           We reverse the trial court’s judgment, in part, as to (1) declaration “b”; (2) summary\n\njudgment on the breach of contract claim asserted by JBBI and TBC; (3) summary judgment in\n\nfavor of Brinkmann on the claims asserted by JBBI and TBC for money had and received and\n\n     15\n         The trial court’s judgment provided in part that “Movants shall recover from Defendants, jointly and severally, all costs of court incurred\nand filed with the Court in this action.” The record does not show the parties raised or addressed apportionment of costs in the trial court, nor is\napportionment of costs raised or addressed on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                                      –45–\n\fdeclaratory judgment; and (4) the award to Brinkmann of damages, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment\n\ninterest, and postjudgment interest on items other than costs of court. We render judgment (1)\n\ndenying summary judgment as to declaration “b” and the breach of contract claim asserted by\n\nJBBI and TBC and (2) modifying the judgment to omit Brinkmann from the parties granted\n\nsummary judgment on the affirmative claims asserted by JBBI and TBC and from the trial\n\ncourt’s award of damages, attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest, and postjudgment interest on\n\nitems other than costs of court. The trial court’s judgment is otherwise affirmed.\n\n\n\n120492F.P05\n\n\n\n\n                                                     /s/ Douglas Lang\n                                                     DOUGLAS S.

(“BSF”) for the purpose of “engaging the full-time services” of appellant Richard\n\nBerryman (“Berryman”) as a “sales and marketing representative.” Appellees JBBI and The\n\nBrinkmann Corporation (“TBC”) filed this lawsuit against appellants asserting claims for, in\n\npart, declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and money had and received. Appellants (1)\n\ncounterclaimed against JBBI for, in part, breach of an alleged contract to pay Berryman’s\n\nexpenses and (2) asserted claims against J. Baxter Brinkmann, individually, (“Brinkmann”) as a\n\fthird party defendant. 1 Appellees filed a motion for (1) traditional summary judgment in their\n\nfavor on the claims asserted by JBBI and TBC and appellants’ counterclaims and (2) no-\n\nevidence summary judgment in their favor on appellants’ counterclaims. The trial court signed a\n\nfinal judgment in which it (1) sustained appellees’ objections to an affidavit of Berryman filed by\n\nappellants as summary judgment evidence, (2) granted appellees’ motion for summary judgment,\n\n(3) made declarations respecting the Agreement, and (4) awarded appellees damages, attorneys’\n\nfees, interest, and costs of court.\n\n           In eleven issues on appeal, appellants contend the trial court erred because (1) the\n\nevidence raises fact issues as to the parties’ claims; (2) the declaratory relief requested by JBBI\n\nand TBC was “redundant with” their breach of contract claim and therefore was “barred as a\n\nmatter of law”; (3) appellees “failed to conclusively prove the reasonableness and necessity of\n\nthe claimed [attorneys’] fees by not segregating fees”; (4) Brinkmann, individually, did not\n\nrecover on any cause of action and therefore should not have been awarded damages, attorneys’\n\nfees, interest, or costs of court; and (5) the sustaining of appellees’ objections to Berryman’s\n\naffidavit constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n           For the reasons below, on this voluminous summary judgment record, we reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment in part, render judgment in part, and otherwise affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                            I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n    1\n        In this opinion, unless otherwise specified, “appellees” refers to, collectively, JBBI, TBC, and Brinkmann.\n\n\n\n                                                                       –2–\n\f          The Agreement was executed on July 2, 2001. 2 It stated in part that JBBI “desires to\n\nemploy the services of [Berryman], through [BSF], for the benefit of [JBBI] and its affiliated\n\ncompanies.” Additionally, the Agreement provided in part\n\n          2. Compensation\n\n          In exchange for the services to be rendered hereunder by [Berryman], [JBBI] shall\n          pay, or cause to be paid, the sum of one million dollars per year in equal monthly\n          installments. . . .\n\n          3. Term\n\n          This Agreement is for a term of five years starting August 1, 2001 and is to be\n          renewed annually thereafter unless either parties [sic] gives notice in writing 90\n          days prior to the end of any anniversary date. Notwithstanding the five year fixed\n          term, [JBBI] may terminate this Agreement and have no further payment\n          obligation if [Berryman] is unable to perform full-time services due to death or\n          disability or has failed to carry out the duties of a senior sales and marketing\n          representative in accord with general industry standards.\n\n          Approximately seven years after the Agreement was executed, an attorney for appellants\n\nsent JBBI a letter dated May 20, 2008. In that letter, appellants’ attorney stated that as a result of\n\nactions taken by JBBI, “including, but not limited to, making defamatory statements” to JBBI\n\nemployees and others, JBBI had “substantially undermined [Berryman’s] ability to perform his\n\njob duties and responsibilities” and therefore had “constructively terminated [Berryman] and\n\nbreached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing with respect to the Agreement.”\n\nFurther, appellants’ attorney (1) stated JBBI had “failed and refused” to reimburse Berryman for\n\napproximately $160,000 in expenses that JBBI was “obligated to pay” pursuant to “Mr.\n\nBerryman’s contract” with JBBI and (2) requested that JBBI contact him to “negotiate a fair and\n\nequitable severance for Mr. Berryman.”\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      As described above, the parties to the Agreement were JBBI and BSF. Additionally, Berryman, individually, guaranteed the obligations\nof BSF.\n\n\n\n                                                                  –3–\n\f       On May 23, 2008, JBBI and TBC (“plaintiffs”) filed this lawsuit against BSF and\n\nBerryman (“defendants”). In their original petition, plaintiffs asserted a claim for “declaratory\n\njudgment relief.” Specifically, plaintiffs requested in part that the trial court declare (1) “whether\n\n[d]efendants have carried on its or their required duties under the terms of the [Agreement]”; (2)\n\nthat plaintiffs have not violated the terms of their “agreements or obligations, if any,” to\n\ndefendants; and (3) “other declaratory relief as necessary to terminate the controversy and\n\nremove uncertainty relating to the [plaintiffs’] alleged remaining rights and obligations to\n\n[d]efendants, if any.” Further, plaintiffs requested “reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred herein and on any appeal.”\n\n       In a letter to defendants dated August 29, 2008, counsel for JBBI stated (1) defendants\n\nhad failed to perform as obligated under the Agreement “for some months now” and (2) JBBI\n\n“hereby terminates the Agreement as permitted in Section 3 and as otherwise allowed by law.”\n\nSubsequent to that letter, plaintiffs filed supplements to their original petition in which they\n\nadded claims for breach of contract and “money had and received/unjust enrichment.” In their\n\nbreach of contract claim, plaintiffs alleged in part that defendants “failed and refused and\n\ncontinue to fail and refuse to fulfill their obligations under the [Agreement],” thus entitling\n\nplaintiffs to damages and attorneys’ fees. In their claim for “money had and received/unjust\n\nenrichment,” plaintiffs asserted in part that “during the May 2008 through August 2008 time\n\nperiod,” defendants “received monies they were not entitled to keep and to which they have been\n\nunjustly enriched.” Pursuant to that claim, plaintiffs sought to recover approximately $334,000\n\nreceived by defendants during that time period, including (1) “$291,666.66 paid during a time\n\nperiod [defendants] performed no work for [plaintiffs]” and (2) approximately $42,000 in\n\n“Airplane Allowance payments” made to defendants pursuant to a “separate verbal agreement”\n\nthat plaintiffs would “provide [d]efendants an upfront allowance for expenses (up to $12,000 per\n\n                                                 –4–\n\fmonth) [d]efendants incurred related to the operation of an aircraft to be used to assist\n\n[d]efendants in performing their duties owed to [p]laintiffs” (the “Airplane Allowance”).\n\n           Defendants filed a general denial answer and asserted several affirmative defenses,\n\nincluding “equitable estoppel.” Additionally, defendants asserted (1) a counterclaim against\n\nJBBI for “breach of contract relating to reimbursement of expenses,” in which defendants\n\ncontended they were owed $157,600.83 in “expenses not paid” by JBBI; and (2) claims for\n\nbusiness disparagement, defamation, and exemplary damages against Brinkmann as a third-party\n\ndefendant.\n\n           JBBI and Brinkmann filed separate general denial answers to defendants’ counterclaims.\n\nAdditionally, JBBI asserted several affirmative defenses, including the statute of frauds. Further,\n\nin Brinkmann’s prayer for relief in his answer, he requested, in part, that he recover costs of\n\ncourt.\n\n           On December 12, 2011, plaintiffs and Brinkmann filed a motion for (1) traditional\n\nsummary judgment on plaintiffs’ breach of contract, money had and received, and declaratory\n\njudgment claims and defendants’ counterclaims and (2) no-evidence summary judgment on\n\ndefendants’ counterclaims. In their motion, plaintiffs stated in part (1) “[b]ased on [d]efendants’\n\nbreach of contract, [p]laintiffs are entitled to elect as their remedy the recovery of the largest\n\ndamage amount suffered due to [d]efendants’ breach, such amount being the $291,666,67 paid\n\nfrom May through August 2008, plus attorney’s fees totaling $160,948.00”; (2) to “prevent\n\nunjust enrichment,” defendants must return to plaintiffs “overpayments” of “$291.666.67 for\n\nwork not performed” 3 and “$41,999.96 in Airplane Allowance payments”; (3) defendants\n\n“ceased performing under the Agreement in at least May of 2008, and thereby materially\n\n\n     3\n       Plaintiffs stated in their brief in support of their motion for summary judgment that they “will only be entitled to collect and will only seek\nthe $291,666.67 once.”\n\n\n\n                                                                        –5–\n\fbreached same”; (4) “[t]he Agreement was terminable from [May of 2008] forward by\n\n[p]laintiffs, and no further obligations are due under the Agreement following its lawful\n\ntermination in August 2008”; (5) “[n]otwithstanding [p]laintiffs’ proper termination of\n\nAgreement for cause, the Agreement actually expired on August 1, 2008”; and (6) JBBI did not\n\nbreach the Agreement or “any ancillary agreement to pay business expenses.”\n\n       The appendix filed in support of the summary judgment motion included, in part (1)\n\nexcerpts from depositions of Berryman and Brinkmann; (2) an affidavit of Brinkmann; (3) copies\n\nof the Agreement and correspondence described above; and (4) an affidavit of plaintiffs’ counsel\n\nrespecting attorneys’ fees.\n\n       Berryman stated in part in his deposition that (1) his job responsibilities pursuant to the\n\nAgreement included preparing for and attending meetings with retailers’ representatives to solicit\n\norders for JBBI’s products, communicating “almost on a daily basis” with Brinkmann, and\n\nparticipating in the “finalization” process respecting retailers’ orders; (2) during two separate\n\nmeetings in 2006 and 2008, Brinkmann complained in front of retailers’ representatives that\n\nBerryman “didn’t work” and buyers did not want to do business with Berryman; (3) Berryman\n\nwas still able to perform his duties after Brinkmann’s negative comments were made; (4) in\n\napproximately April 2008, JBBI hired Mike Bush; (5) at the time Bush was hired, Bush told\n\nBerryman that Berryman was “being replaced” by Bush; (6) Berryman was not replaced by\n\nBush; (7) there is no written agreement for reimbursement of expenses; (8) at approximately the\n\nsame time the Agreement was executed in 2001, Berryman and Brinkmann entered into an oral\n\nagreement that Berryman’s business expenses would be reimbursed by JBBI; (9) after May 20,\n\n2008, Berryman did not return Brinkmann’s calls, with one exception in which he told\n\nBrinkmann his attorney had advised him not to speak with Brinkmann; did not participate in\n\n\n\n\n                                               –6–\n\f“finalization” negotiations; and did not attend any meetings; and (10) from May 2008 to August\n\n2008, Berryman continued to receive and accept checks from Brinkmann.\n\n       Brinkmann testified in part in his deposition and affidavit (1) although reimbursement of\n\nBerryman’s expenses was not part of “the deal,” he reimbursed Berryman for various expenses\n\nstarting in 2001 and continuing until at least 2006; (2) defendants ceased performing their\n\nrequired duties under the Agreement “as early as the first half of May 2008”; (3) after defendants\n\nceased performing under the Agreement, JBBI “hoped [d]efendants would resume performance”\n\nand paid BSF $41,999.96 in airplane allowance payments and an additional sum of more than\n\n$291,666.67; and (4) BSF and Berryman have not returned those amounts to plaintiffs.\n\n       Finally, counsel for plaintiffs testified in part in his affidavit (1) at least 85%, or\n\n$127,073, of the attorneys’ fees and paralegal fees incurred by plaintiffs so far “are recoverable\n\nagainst the [d]efendants in this lawsuit”; (2) “it is reasonable to conclude that [plaintiffs’]\n\ncounsel’s activities cannot all be segregated by task and as such are dependent on the same or\n\nsimilar sets of facts and circumstances, are part of many of the same tasks, and are therefore so\n\nintertwined that they cannot be so separated or segregated”; (3) a fair estimate of additional\n\nattorneys’ fees likely be incurred by plaintiffs through the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment to advance plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims” against defendants is at least\n\n$33,875; and (4) in the event of appeal of plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims,” plaintiffs will likely\n\nincur at least an additional $35,000 in fees in defense of an appeal to the Dallas Court of\n\nAppeals, $20,000 in fees in briefing an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, and $15,000 in fees\n\nif the Texas Supreme Court grants a hearing on such appeal.\n\n       In their amended response to plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, defendants\n\nargued in part (1) the agreement to pay expenses was an enforceable “oral modification” and/or\n\n“implied in fact modification” of the “original contract” entered into between the parties on July\n\n                                               –7–\n\f2, 2001; (2) Berryman was justified in discontinuing performance under “the written contract and\n\noral modification of the contract” in May 2008 because he was relieved of performance by\n\nplaintiffs’ “material breach,” i.e. plaintiffs’ “slanderous statements,” hiring of Bush, and failure\n\nto pay Berryman’s expenses; (3) equitable relief is not warranted because Berryman received and\n\naccepted the sums paid to him as part of the damages he is entitled to receive as a result of\n\nplaintiffs’ “material breach” of the “contract between the parties”; and (4) the statute of frauds\n\ndoes not apply to the oral agreement to reimburse expenses because “each of the claims was\n\ncapable of being performed within one year” and, alternatively, “part performance by the\n\nparties” takes the oral agreement outside the statute of frauds. Attachments to defendants’\n\nresponse included an affidavit of Berryman and an “Expense Report Tracking Log” that showed\n\n$157,600.83 in “outstanding” expenses incurred by Berryman from 2006 to 2008.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed (1) “objections to and motion to strike defendants’ ‘evidence’ in support\n\nof their amended response” and (2) supplemental objections to defendants’ summary judgment\n\nevidence. Therein, plaintiffs contended Berryman’s affidavit (1) contains irrelevant testimony;\n\n(2) lacks necessary attachments; (3) is a “sham affidavit” as to specified statements of Berryman\n\nin paragraphs 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, and 28; (4) “fails to set forth actual facts based upon\n\nBerryman’s personal knowledge”; and (5) “cites Berryman’s conclusory personal beliefs based\n\nupon conjecture and hearsay.”       Specifically, in an objection to Berryman’s affidavit “as a\n\nwhole,” plaintiffs stated in part\n\n       Berryman amended his [affidavit] to assert that he possessed personal knowledge\n       of all of “the facts set forth” in the [affidavit], based upon (1) his conversations\n       with [Brinkmann], (2) conversations with unidentified employees of JBBI, (3) the\n       unattached “business records” of JBBI . . . and (4) the unattached “business\n       records” of [BSF]. Berryman cannot rely on hearsay to demonstrate his “personal\n       knowledge.”\n\n(citation to record omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                –8–\n\f          Additionally, plaintiffs filed a reply to defendants’ response to the motion for summary\n\njudgment. Plaintiffs asserted in part (1) defendants’ election to continue performance after\n\nplaintiffs’ alleged nonpayment of expenses starting in 2006 precluded any excuse for defendants’\n\nterminating performance; (2) defendants’ response did not raise a legal claim or fact issue\n\nrespecting defendants’ contentions that plaintiffs “prevented [d]efendants from being able to\n\nperform under the [Agreement]” or “‘constructively terminated’ [d]efendants”; (3) defendants\n\nhave no damages for breach because plaintiffs “paid the entire value” of the Agreement; (4) the\n\noral agreement alleged by defendants respecting payment of expenses was not performable\n\nwithin one year and therefore is precluded by the statute of frauds and, alternatively, “lacks\n\ndefinitive contract terms”; and (5) while defendants’ response “appears to argue” that application\n\nof the statute of frauds is precluded by “partial performance,” defendants provide “only a\n\nfootnote citation without analysis” respecting that argument.\n\n          In the final judgment described above, 4 the trial court (1) defined “movants” as JBBI,\n\nTBC, and Brinkmann, collectively, and (2) ordered that “summary judgment is granted in favor\n\nof Movants on their breach of contract, money had and received, and declaratory judgment\n\nclaims.” Further, the trial court ordered therein that “Movants shall recover from Defendants,\n\njointly and severally,” (1) “actual damages in the amount of $333,666.63,” which “includes\n\n$291,666.67 for contract payments made by Plaintiffs to Defendants when work was not being\n\nperformed by Defendants, and $41,999.96 in Airplane Allowance payments made by Plaintiffs to\n\nDefendants when work was not being performed by Defendants”; (2) “their reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees as a result of the above-mentioned breach of contract and declaratory\n\njudgment claims in the amount of $160,948.00”; (3) “$49,117.95 in pre-judgment interest on the\n\n\n     4\n       The record shows a hearing on appellees’ motion for summary judgment was scheduled.

We review the\n\nevidence presented by the motion and response in the light most favorable to the party against\n\nwhom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if\n\nreasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.\n\n   5\n       Specifically, the trial court stated in the final judgment\n\n           [T]he court holds the following as a matter of undisputed fact and law as it related to Movants’ declaratory judgment claim:\n\n           a. Defendants ceased performing under the Agreement in, at least, May of 2008 when Berryman refused to fulfill his duties\n           and obligations for Plaintiffs. This constituted a material breach of the Agreement. The Agreement was at a minimum\n           terminable from that point forward by Plaintiffs, and after making every reasonable effort to communicate with Berryman,\n           Plaintiffs lawfully terminated the Agreement in August 2008. Thus, no further obligations are owed or due to Defendants\n           under the Agreement.\n\n           b. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ lawful termination of the Agreement, the Agreement expired on August 1, 2008. The\n           Agreement provides for automatic renewal upon the anniversary date of the contract only if neither party provides written\n           notice to the other party to the contrary. Here, Defendants’ Agreement Termination Letter was received by Plaintiffs in\n           May of 2008, and the Agreement expired by its own terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.\n\n           c. The Agreement is defined by the four comers of the document, and the alleged oral contracts for expense reimbursement\n           and Airplane allowance are not a part of the Agreement.\n\n           d. JBBI did not, constructively or otherwise, breach the Agreement.\n\n\n                                                                     –10–\n\fTimpte Indus., Inc. v.

Breach of Contract Claim Asserted by JBBI and TBC\n\n        We begin with appellants’ second issue, in which they contend “the trial court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment on [a]ppellees’ claim for breach of contract because it applied an\n\nincorrect measure of damages and there was no evidence of recoverable damages.” According to\n\nappellants, “the evidence of damages was legally insufficient because the evidence represented\n\noverpayments that occurred for approximately three months after the alleged breach and thus\n\ncaused the trial court to utilize an improper measure of damages (an incorrect time period).”\n\nAdditionally, appellants assert in their reply brief in this Court that “[appellees’] only damage\n\nevidence relates to amounts that are not recoverable, rendering their evidence legally\n\ninsufficient.”\n\n        Appellees respond (1) appellants “failed to object or otherwise raise to the trial court any\n\nallegation that the measure of damages provided by [a]ppellees was somehow improper” and\n\ntherefore waived the alleged error, (2) appellants “ignore [a]ppellees’ right to elect to continue to\n\n                                               –12–\n\fperform under the Agreement” and “sue for damages as they accrue when the time for\n\nperformance under the contract is due,” and (3) “[a]ppellants’ arguments that [a]ppellees could\n\nnot ‘create or increase’ their damages are actually arguing a failure to mitigate,” an affirmative\n\ndefense that appellants did not plead.\n\n       “A successful breach of contract claim requires proof of the following elements: (1) a\n\nvalid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the\n\ncontract by the defendant; and (4) damages sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the breach.”\n\nPetras v.

App.—Eastland Apr. 25, 2002,\n\nno pet.) (not designated for publication).\n\n       In C.K. Oil, Hrubetz Operating Company (“HOPCO”) contracted to operate certain gas\n\nand oil leases. C.K. Oil, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">32344609</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1. Subsequently, a working interest in the\n\nleases was conveyed to C.K. Oil Properties, Inc. (“C.K.”). Id. C.K. informed HOPCO that\n\nHOPCO was terminated as operator and advised HOPCO that C.K. would not reimburse\n\nHOPCO for any operating expenses incurred after November 10, 1997. Id. HOPCO continued\n\nto operate the leases. Id. Additionally, HOPCO filed suit against C.K. to specifically enforce the\n\nterms of its contract and sought damages from C.K. as a result of the attempted termination. Id.\n\nat *2. Those damages included expenses for operating the leases from the date of the purported\n\ntermination through the date of trial. Id. C.K. counterclaimed for trespass, asserting HOPCO\n\nwas liable to C.K. in tort for refusing to accept C.K.’s breach of the contract. Id. The trial court\n\ngranted a motion by C.K. for partial summary judgment denying specific performance and the\n\nremaining issues were tried before a jury. Id. The jury found in favor of HOPCO and awarded\n\nHOPCO damages that included its expenses incurred in operating the leases after the date of the\n\npurported termination. Id. On appeal, C.K. argued in part that pursuant to the rule stated in\n\nOsage Oil, HOPCO was (1) required to accept C.K.’s repudiation and (2) not entitled to recover\n\nany damages for expenses incurred in operating the lease after the date of the purported\n\ntermination. Id. at *8, *14. The Eleventh District Court of Appeals in Eastland disagreed with\n\nC.K. Id. The court stated that the “damage rule” announced in Osage Oil “does not apply to\n\naffirmative claims for relief which a repudiating party asserts against the non-breaching party for\n\nfailing to accept the breach.” Id. at *8. Therefore, the court concluded, HOPCO was “not\n\nrequired to accept C.K.’s repudiation.” Id. Further, in considering HOPCO’s claim for damages,\n\nthe court stated in part, “For the same reasons that we have rejected the ruling in Osage Oil as\n\n                                               –15–\n\fserving as a basis for [C.K.’s] counterclaims sounding in tort, we do not find Osage Oil to be\n\ncontrolling on the issue of HOPCO’s damages.” Id. at *14. The court concluded, “Because the\n\nruling in Osage Oil directly conflicts with the non-breaching party’s option of treating the\n\nrepudiation as inoperative, we decline to apply Osage Oil to the facts of this case.” Id.\n\n       Unlike the case before us, C.K. Oil involved not only a non-repudiating party claiming\n\ndamages, but also a repudiating party seeking to use the rule in Osage Oil to profit from its own\n\nbreach. See id. at *8. We cannot agree with appellees that the C.K. Oil court’s conclusion that\n\nOsage Oil was not controlling on the facts of that case supports appellees’ position that Osage\n\nOil is inapplicable in the case before us.\n\n       Bumb involved an employee, John W. Bumb, whose employment contract provided that\n\neither he or his employer, InterComp Technologies, L.L.C. (“InterComp”), could terminate their\n\nrelationship at will by giving ninety days’ notice. Bumb, 64 S.W.3d at 124. On August 4, 1995,\n\nInterComp notified Bumb that his employment was terminated effective November 3, 1995. Id.\n\nOn September 25, 1995, InterComp allegedly told Bumb that it would no longer pay his salary or\n\nreimburse him for expenses.       Id.   However, Bumb continued to perform his duties until\n\nNovember 3, 1995. Id. On October 12, 1995, Bumb downloaded copies of InterComp software\n\nin violation of his employment contract. Id. Almost four years later, Bumb filed suit against\n\nInterComp for unpaid salary and expenses. Id. Intercomp moved for summary judgment,\n\nalleging it was excused from further performance under the contract when Bumb breached the\n\ncontract by downloading software. Id. In response, Bumb claimed InterComp breached the\n\ncontract first by orally repudiating the contract on September 25, 1995, and by failing to pay his\n\nsalary and expenses on October 1, 1995. Id. The trial court granted InterComp’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 125. The Fourteenth District Court of Appeals in Houston affirmed,\n\nstating “an anticipatory repudiation gives the nonrepudiating party the option to treat the\n\n                                               –16–\n\frepudiation as a breach, or ignore it and await the agreed upon time of performance.” Id. The\n\ncourt reasoned that “by waiting to sue until after InterComp’s performance was due, Bumb was\n\nobligated to continue performing under the contract, and any breach on his own part prior to the\n\nNovember 3, 1995 termination date excused InterComp from further performance.”               Id.\n\nTherefore, the court concluded, Bumb’s October 12, 1995 breach barred his suit for any breaches\n\nby InterComp thereafter. Id. As to breaches by InterComp prior to October 12, 1995, the court\n\nobserved that the contract provided Bumb’s monthly salary was payable “in arrears.” Id. Thus,\n\npayment for Bumb’s services during October was not due until November 1, 1995, a date after\n\nBumb’s October 12, 1995 breach of contract. Id. Further, as to Bumb’s claim for expenses, the\n\ncourt observed that the contract required “appropriate support” before expenses would be\n\nreimbursed. Id. The court stated there was no proof the required support had been provided to\n\nIntercomp until a date after Bumb’s October 12, 1995 breach. Id.\n\n       Appellees assert Bumb demonstrates that the rule of Osage Oil is not currently the law in\n\ncases involving contracts for services. However, the court in Bumb did not specifically address\n\nthe issue of whether, when a contract is repudiated, the non-repudiating party can “increase the\n\ndamages to which he would otherwise be entitled” by continuing to perform. See Osage Oil, 230\n\nS.W. at 522. We cannot agree with appellees that Bumb supports their position that Osage Oil is\n\ninapplicable to the case before us.\n\n       Finally, in Avasthi, Sharma Dronamraju contracted with a petroleum consulting\n\ncompany, Avasthi & Associates, Inc. (“A & A”), to provide geological services for a specific\n\nproject. Avasthi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6644873</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *1. The contract contained detailed reporting and billing\n\nrequirements. Id. It was undisputed that Dronamraju “never timely complied” with those\n\nrequirements during the ten-month time period that he worked for A & A. Id. at *2. Despite\n\nsuch noncompliance, A & A paid Dronamraju on numerous occasions and continued to request\n\n                                             –17–\n\fhim to perform work on the project. Id. at *3-4. After the project was completed, A & A\n\ninformed Dronamraju that certain bills for his time “had been submitted too late” and would not\n\nbe paid by A & A. Id. at *3. Dronamraju filed suit against A & A for breach of contract,\n\nseeking payment of his unpaid bills. Id. The jury found in favor of Dronamraju. Id. at *4. On\n\nappeal, A & A argued that as a matter of law, it was excused from performing under the contract,\n\ni.e. paying Dronamraju, because of Dronamraju’s prior material breach of the same contract, i.e.\n\nthe failure to timely bill. Id. at *6. The First District Court of Appeals in Houston disagreed. Id.\n\nat *7.    The court concluded that by seeking to continue benefiting from the contract by\n\nrequesting Dronamraju continue performing work, “A & A waived its ability to treat\n\nDronamraju’s breach as a justification for non-performance.” Id. at *8. Unlike the case before\n\nus, Avasthi did not involve a non-repudiating party seeking to recover damages for breach of\n\ncontract after continuing performance. See id. Therefore, that case is inapposite as to whether\n\nOsage Oil applies to such a fact situation.\n\n         As described above, the Agreement stated JBBI was employing BSF “for the purpose of\n\nengaging the full-time services of [Berryman].”           A contract for personal services is not\n\nspecifically enforceable.

Further, appellees assert in their brief on appeal that “[a]s early as the first half\n\nof May of 2008, [a]ppellants altogether ceased performance under the Agreement.” The record\n\nshows that at that point, the $291,666.67 claimed by appellees as breach of contract damages had\n\nnot been paid to appellants. Appellees assert they continued to pay appellants in May, June,\n\nJuly, and August of 2008, even though appellants “never resumed performance under the\n\nAgreement.” Thus, the record shows that absent the continuation of payments by appellees, they\n\nwould not “otherwise be entitled” to the $291,666.67 they claim as breach of contract damages.\n\n                                                 –18–\n\fSee Osage Oil, 230 S.W. at 522. On this record, we conclude those sums are not recoverable as\n\nbreach of contract damages. See id.; see also Tower Contracting Co., Inc. v.

See Petras, 248 S.W.3d at 477; Barnett, 123 S.W.3d at 815; see also\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n           We decide in favor of appellants on their second issue. 6\n\n                                                   2. Money Had and Received\n\n           In their third issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on [a]ppellees’ claims for money had and received because recovery is barred by the\n\nvoluntary payment doctrine.”                      Appellees respond in part that this argument fails because\n\nappellants did not plead voluntary payment as an affirmative defense and “did not cite evidence\n\nto or raise the issue of voluntary payment” in their summary judgment response in the trial court.\n\nIn their reply brief in this Court, appellants assert in part (1) “[t]he voluntary payment doctrine is\n\nan equitable estoppel-based defense,” (2) appellants “pled equitable estoppel” in their answer,\n\nand (3) “[b]ecause [plaintiffs] failed to specially except to [defendants’] affirmative defenses,\n\nasserting a general equitable estoppel defense was sufficient to plead the sub-defense of\n\nvoluntary payment.”\n\n\n\n\n     6\n         In their first issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on [a]ppellees’ claim for breach of contract\nbecause [a]ppellees failed to conclusively prove causation.” In light of our disposition of appellants’ second issue, we need not reach appellants’\nfirst issue. See TEX. R. APP.

App.—Dallas 2011, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n       As described above, appellants filed an initial brief and a reply brief in this Court. In\n\nthose briefs, appellants do not address appellees’ objections that portions of Berryman’s affidavit\n\nconstituted a “sham affidavit.” Therefore, we conclude appellants have presented no challenge\n\nin this Court to the trial court’s sustaining of appellees’ “sham affidavit” objections respecting\n\nparagraphs 9, 12, 15, 16, 19, 22, 24, and 28 of Berryman’s affidavit. See Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at\n\n871; Bradford Partners, 231 S.W.3d at 521.\n\n       As to appellees’ objection “to the entirety of Berryman’s affidavit for failing to be based\n\non personal knowledge,” appellants contend in their reply brief in this Court that they “properly\n\naddressed [appellees’] personal knowledge arguments, and therefore, did not waive their right to\n\nargue against them on appeal.” According to appellants, in their initial appellate brief, they (1)\n\n“cite to [Berryman’s] testimony that he was present during his conversations with [Brinkmann]\n\nand certain JBBI employees, and therefore demonstrated he had the personal knowledge\n\nregarding what statements were made during those conversations”; (2) “dedicated an entire\n\nsection of their brief to explaining how the statements of Brinkmann and his employees were not\n\nhearsay because the statements constitute admissions by a party opponent”; and (3) explained\n\n“how [appellees’] own internal business records were the source of [Berryman’s] personal\n\nknowledge.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              –22–\n\f          First, appellants’ citations in their initial appellate brief that purportedly show\n\nBerryman’s “personal knowledge” as to his conversations with Brinkmann and JBBI employees\n\nappear in a section of appellants’ brief addressing objections to “conclusory statements” of\n\nBerryman. The issue of whether Berryman’s “personal knowledge” was based on hearsay was\n\nnot addressed with respect to those statements.\n\n          Second, in the portion of appellants’ initial appellate brief addressing appellees’ hearsay\n\nobjections, appellants assert appellees are “incorrect” that Berryman’s affidavit contained\n\nhearsay. Then, appellants contend, “For one, contrary to [appellees’] arguments, the statements\n\nof people in [appellees’] accounting department that certain submitted reimbursements had been\n\napproved (CR at 712) fall under the hearsay exception for admissions of a party opponent.” In\n\nsupport of that contention, appellants cite Texas Rule of Evidence 801(e)(2)(D). See TEX. R.\n\nEVID. 801(e)(2)(D) (providing hearsay exception for statement by party’s agent or servant\n\nconcerning matter within scope of agency or employment made during existence of relationship).\n\nThe page of the record specifically cited by appellants, page 712, is a page of Berryman’s\n\naffidavit that contains paragraphs 26 and 27 and portions of paragraphs 25 and 28.

However, (1) appellants do not cite\nto paragraph 24 in their appellate argument respecting hearsay and (2) Berryman’s statements in paragraph 24 were among those objected to\npursuant to the “sham affidavit” objections described above.\n\n\n\n                                                                 –23–\n\f(proponent of hearsay has burden to show testimony fits within exception). Appellants do not\n\notherwise cite any “statements of Brinkmann and his employees” that they contend “constitute\n\nadmissions by a party opponent.”\n\n       Finally, in the third portion of appellants’ initial brief to which they direct this Court,\n\nappellants specifically address appellees’ objection that Berryman’s affidavit should be struck\n\nbecause Berryman did not attach required documents pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n166a(f). See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(f) (providing in part that “[s]worn or certified copies of all\n\npapers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be attached thereto”). Appellants cite the\n\nfollowing statement of Berryman in his affidavit:\n\n       I am personally aware of my own actions since 2001, and the damages claimed by\n       [d]efendants in this action. In addition, I have personal knowledge of the facts set\n       forth below based on my direct conversations with [Brinkmann]; employees of\n       [JBBI]; the business records of [JBBI] . . . ; and the business records of [BSF].\n\nThen, appellants argue that because Berryman “simply identified a source from which his\n\npersonal knowledge was developed” and “does not refer to documents in this paragraph,” he\n\n“was not required to attach documents.” Appellants do not address hearsay in that argument.\n\n       Because the trial court could have granted appellees’ objections to Berryman’s affidavit\n\non grounds not challenged by appellants, we conclude appellants have waived their complaint\n\nthat the trial court erred by sustaining appellees’ objections to their summary judgment evidence.\n\nSee Goodenberger, 343 S.W.3d at 540 (citing Cantu, 195 S.W.3d at 871).\n\n       We decide appellants’ ninth issue against them.\n\n                         4. Appellants’ Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n\n       Now, we address together appellants’ tenth and eleventh issues, in which they assert error\n\nby the trial court in granting summary judgment on their counterclaim for “breach of the\n\nagreement to reimburse expenses.”       Specifically, in their tenth issue, appellants assert the\n\nevidence “raises material questions of fact as to the existence, terms, and breach” of the\n                                               –24–\n\fagreement to reimburse expenses. In their eleventh issue, appellants contend in part that material\n\nfact questions exist pertaining to the applicability of the statute of frauds, including whether the\n\nagreement to reimburse expenses (1) was an immaterial change to the Agreement, (2) “modified\n\nonly the one year renewals of the Agreement,” (3) “was independent of the Agreement,” and (4)\n\nis enforceable under the doctrine of partial performance.\n\n       Appellees respond that “the statute of frauds bars appellants’ expense reimbursement\n\nbreach of contract claim.” Further, appellees argue partial performance does not bar application\n\nof the statute of frauds in this case because appellants waived that defense.\n\n       Under the statute of frauds, certain contracts are not enforceable unless they are in\n\nwriting and signed by the person against whom enforcement of the contract is sought.

Appellants contend “[e]ven if the statute of frauds\n\ninitially applied to the expense reimbursement agreement as a modification of the 2001\n\nAgreement, an agreement to reimburse expenses can be implied regarding the one year renewals\n\nof the 2001 Agreement that would not be barred by the statute of frauds.” According to\n\nappellants, (1) “[o]nce the initial term of the 2001 Agreement expired, and it automatically\n\nrenewed on an annual basis, it was no longer covered by the statute of frauds because it was\n\ncapable of being performed within a year” and (2) “[l]ikewise, the modification of the 2001\n\nAgreement to allow for expense reimbursement would not be covered by the Statute of Frauds.”\n\nIn support of their argument, appellants cite Garcia v. Karam, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2431108\"><a href=\"/opinion/2431108/garcia-v-karam/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (Tex. 1955),\n\nfor the statement that “[i]f neither the portion of the written contract affected by the subsequent\n\nmodification nor the matter encompassed by the modification itself is required by the Statute of\n\nFrauds to be in writing, then the oral modification will not render the contract unenforceable.”\n\nAdditionally, appellants cite Miller for the statement that “contracts that can be performed within\n\none year are not within the Statute of Frauds.” Miller, 517 S.W.2d at 775.\n\n       Garcia involved a purchaser’s action for a seller’s alleged breach of a written contract for\n\nthe sale of realty. Garcia, 276 S.W.2d at 256; see also TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01\n\n(b)(4) (providing contract for sale of real estate is within statute of frauds). The contract\n\nprovided that $20,000 of the purchase price was to be paid by merchandise. Garcia, 276 S.W.2d\n\nat 256. Subsequent to executing the written contract, the parties orally agreed that the seller\n\nwould accept the merchandise without the necessity of taking inventory. Id. The purchaser later\n\nfiled and prevailed in a suit to enforce the contract as modified by the oral agreement. Id. On\n\nappeal to the supreme court, the seller contended the oral modification of the contract was\n\n                                              –27–\n\fprohibited by the statute of frauds because it amounted to a “complete change” of the terms of\n\nthe contract between the parties and was an attempt to “substitute an entirely new consideration”\n\nfor the one required by the writing. Id. The supreme court reasoned, “Had the [plaintiff]\n\ncontracted in writing for the sale of his merchandise for ‘$20,000.00, at invoice’, and\n\nsubsequently agreed orally with the [defendant] to convey without an inventory, the Statute of\n\nFrauds would have been wholly inapplicable.” Id. at 257. The court stated that the oral\n\nmodification did not change the “subject matter of the contract,” but “only the method of\n\nperforming it.” Id. Therefore, the court concluded, the subsequent oral modification of the\n\nwritten contract was valid. Id.\n\n       In Miller, Kenneth F. Miller was employed by Riata Cadillac Co. as a used car manager\n\npursuant to an oral contract.      Miller, 517 S.W.2d at 774.        Miller was terminated after\n\napproximately three and one-half years and filed suit against Riata to enforce the alleged terms\n\nof the oral contract. Id. Riata argued the contract was an unenforceable contract within the\n\nstatute of frauds. Id. On appeal, the supreme court concluded in part that because it was\n\nundisputed that the contract was an “indefinite term employment contract,” it was considered\n\nperformable in one year and therefore was not within the statute of frauds. Id. at 776.\n\n       Unlike the case before us, neither Garcia nor Miller involved a contract with an initial\n\nterm longer than one year followed by automatic annual renewals.             Further, neither case\n\ndiscussed application of the statute of frauds to such a contract. Therefore, we do not find those\n\ncases instructive. Appellants cite no other authority, and we have found none, to support their\n\nposition that “[o]nce the initial term of the 2001 Agreement expired, . . . it was no longer covered\n\nby the statute of frauds because it was capable of being performed within a year.” Cf.

We cannot agree with appellants that the materiality of the modification in\n\nquestion has any bearing on the application of the statute of frauds in this case.\n\n       Third, appellants contend in their eleventh issue that “[e]ven if the statute of frauds\n\napplies to modifications of the 2001 Agreement, the expense reimbursement agreement\n\nalternatively should be viewed not as a direct modification of the 2001 Agreement, but rather as\n\nindependent of the 2001 Agreement.” According to appellants, because there is no time period\n\nfixed for performing the “independent” expense reimbursement agreement, “it must be treated as\n\ncapable of being performed within a year.”          Therefore, appellants assert, “if the expense\n\nreimbursement agreement is independent of the 2001 Agreement, the statute of frauds would not\n\nbar its enforcement.”\n\n       Appellees contend appellants pleaded and argued in the trial court that “there was an oral\n\nmodification of the written Agreement.” (emphasis original). According to appellees, appellants\n\ndid not assert in the trial court that “the expense reimbursement agreement was a stand alone\n\nagreement” and therefore appellants cannot make that contention for the first time on appeal.\n\nFurther, appellees argue, “even if such an agreement existed, it could not have been performed\n\nwithin one year because it would necessarily correlate to the five (5) year term of the\n\nAgreement.”\n\n       The record shows appellants asserted in their amended response to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment that the agreement to pay expenses was an “oral modification” of the\n\nAgreement and/or an “implied in fact modification.” Appellants did not argue in the trial court\n\nthat “the expense reimbursement agreement is independent of the 2001 Agreement.”\n\nConsequently, that argument presents nothing for this Court’s review.

The\n\nsupreme court concluded in that case that when such a challenge is “restricted to the face of the\n\nrecord (for example, when expert testimony is speculative or conclusory on its face),” a party\n\n“may challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence even in the absence of any objection to its\n\nadmissibility.” In the case before us, appellants do not explain, and the record does not show,\n\nhow their complaint respecting redundancy is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.\n\n       On this record, we conclude appellants’ fourth issue presents nothing for this Court’s\n\nreview.

Fact Questions Respecting Trial Court’s Declarations\n\n           In their fifth and sixth issues, appellants contend the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on appellees’ declaratory judgment claim because fact questions exist (1) “as to the\n\ntrial court’s declarations” and (2) “concerning whether [a]ppellees’ conduct excused further\n\nperformance by [a]ppellants.” 9\n\n           First, we consider appellants’ assertion in their sixth issue that “any breach by\n\n[appellants] was excused by [appellees’] conduct.” In support of their argument, appellants cite\n\nthe general rule that “performance is excused when a party to a contract prevents the other from\n\nperforming.” See O’Shea v. Int’l Bus. Mach. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1783738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1783738/oshea-v-international-bus-machines-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846 (Tex. Civ. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 1979, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Appellants contend that “[u]nder this general rule,\n\nactions of [appellees] that undermined or interfered with [appellants’] ability to sell or market\n\nproducts excused any alleged breach of such duties because such actions prevented\n\nperformance.” Additionally, appellants cite O’Shea in support of their position that “[a]ny\n\nquestion of fact as to whether [appellees] interfered with [appellants’] performance would\n\npreclude summary judgment.”\n\n           Appellees respond in part that appellants “cite no authority for the proposition that\n\n‘undermining’ or ‘interfering’ are the equivalent of preventing performance.” Further, appellees\n\nargue the trial court “properly disposed of appellants’ attempt to excuse their breach as a matter\n\nof law” because “[a]ppellees presented to the trial court undisputed evidence that [a]ppellants\n\nwere at all times able to perform despite the actions [a]ppellants want to complain about.”\n\n\n\n     9\n        Additionally, appellants assert in part in their sixth issue that summary judgment on appellees’ breach of contract claim was precluded by\nfact issues respecting whether appellants’ performance was excused. However, we concluded in our analysis pertaining to issue two above that\nthe trial court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of appellees on their breach of contract claim. Therefore, we need not address the\nportion of appellants’ sixth issue pertaining to appellees’ breach of contract claim.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –34–\n\f       The court in O’Shea did not address the question of whether evidence that a party\n\n“interfered” with performance constitutes evidence that performance was prevented. See 578\n\nS.W.2d at 846. Appellants cite no other authority, and we have found none, in support of their\n\nposition that “[a]ny question of fact as to whether [appellees] interfered with [appellants’]\n\nperformance would preclude summary judgment.” In support of their argument that the evidence\n\nraises a fact question as to whether appellants’ performance of the Agreement was “prevented,”\n\nappellants cite portions of (1) Berryman’s affidavit and (2) the depositions of Berryman and\n\nBrinkmann.    We concluded above that the trial court did not err by sustaining appellees’\n\nobjection to Berryman’s affidavit. Therefore, we do not consider that affidavit in our analysis.\n\nThe excerpts from Berryman’s deposition cited by appellants include Berryman’s testimony that\n\n(1) during two separate meetings in 2006 and 2008, Brinkmann stated in front of retailers’\n\nrepresentatives that Berryman “didn’t work” and buyers did not want to do business with\n\nBerryman; (2) in approximately April 2008, JBBI hired Mike Bush; and (3) at the time Bush was\n\nhired, Bush told Berryman that Berryman was “being replaced” by Bush.              Additionally,\n\nappellants cite deposition testimony of Brinkmann respecting the hiring of Bush.\n\n       The record shows Berryman testified in his deposition that he was still able to perform\n\nhis duties under the Agreement after the negative comments made by Brinkmann in 2006 and\n\n2008. Therefore, we cannot conclude those comments prevented Berryman’s performance. In\n\ntheir reply brief in this Court, appellants assert that even if the “defamatory statements” of\n\nBrinkmann did not prevent performance, appellees “wholly frustrated [appellants’] ability to\n\nperform” because they “effectively eliminated [Berryman’s] position” by hiring Bush and\n\n“wresting away [Berryman’s] authority to act on his accounts.”        However, the deposition\n\ntestimony cited by appellants does not show Berryman’s performance was prevented by the\n\nhiring of Bush. Further, Berryman testified in his deposition that he was not replaced by Bush.\n\n                                             –35–\n\fOn this record, we cannot conclude the evidence raises a fact question as to whether appellants’\n\nperformance of the Agreement was “excused.”\n\n           We decide against appellants on their sixth issue.\n\n           As to the trial court’s four declarations in the judgment, all are challenged by appellants.\n\nHowever, in light of our conclusions above, appellants’ arguments respecting the trial court’s\n\ndeclaration “c” need not be addressed. 10 Consequently, we address only appellants’ challenges\n\nrespecting the following declarations:\n\n           a. Defendants ceased performing under the Agreement in, at least, May of 2008\n           when Berryman refused to fulfill his duties and obligations for Plaintiffs. This\n           constituted a material breach of the Agreement. The Agreement was at a\n           minimum terminable from that point forward by Plaintiffs, and after making every\n           reasonable effort to communicate with Berryman, Plaintiffs lawfully terminated\n           the Agreement in August 2008. Thus, no further obligations are owed or due to\n           Defendants under the Agreement.\n\n           b. Notwithstanding Plaintiffs’ lawful termination of the Agreement, the\n           Agreement expired on August 1, 2008. The Agreement provides for automatic\n           renewal upon the anniversary date of the contract only if neither party provides\n           written notice to the other party to the contrary. Here, Defendants’ Agreement\n           Termination Letter was received by Plaintiffs in May of 2008, and the Agreement\n           expired by its own terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.\n           ....\n           d. JBBI did not, constructively or otherwise, breach the Agreement.\n\n           With respect to declaration “a,” appellants argue they “presented evidence that the 2001\n\nAgreement had already been constructively terminated by [appellees’] conduct that undermined\n\nand interfered with [appellants’] performance of the contract.” According to appellants, “[t]his\n\nevidence raised a fact question as to whether [appellees] breached the agreement, which should\n\nhave prevented the trial court from entering summary judgment and making the above\n\ndeclaration.”\n\n     10\n         Specifically, appellants contend the trial court’s declaration “c” was issued in error because “[t]he existence of fact questions surrounding\nthe partial performance doctrine and the modification of the 2001 Agreement’s one year extensions prevented [appellees] from conclusively\nproving that the oral agreements [to reimburse expenses] were not part of the 2001 Agreement.” We concluded in the analysis above pertaining\nto issue eleven that the trial court did not err by concluding no fact questions existed as to partial performance and “modification of the 2001\nAgreement’s one year extensions.”\n\n\n\n                                                                       –36–\n\f       Appellees respond in part that appellants’ argument respecting “constructive termination”\n\nis waived because appellants “do not cite or analyze any cases in alleged support of their\n\ncontention that constructive termination principles apply in non-employment contract cases or, if\n\nsuch did apply, connecting evidence to elements of constructive termination to demonstrate the\n\nexistence of a fact issue.” Additionally, appellees contend “[t]he evidence is uncontroverted that\n\nworking conditions did not force [a]ppellants to stop performing, and that [a]ppellants did not\n\n‘resign’ or stop performance when the alleged offending incidents occurred, such being\n\nrequirements of a constructive discharge claim in the employment context.”\n\n       In their reply brief in this Court, appellants contend appellees’ allegations of “waiver” fail\n\nfor two reasons. First, appellants assert appellees “misunderstand the point” of appellants’\n\nargument. Specifically, appellants assert “[t]he ‘constructive termination’ language was loosely\n\nused to argue that [appellees] breached before [appellants’] alleged breach, and therefore, the\n\nfurther performance by [appellants] was excused.” Appellants contend they “presented summary\n\njudgment evidence that [appellees] breached before [May 2008] by engaging in conduct that\n\nundermined and interfered with [appellants’] performance of the contract.” In support of that\n\nassertion, appellants cite the same evidence cited by them in their argument pertaining to\n\nprevention of performance in their sixth issue above. To the extent appellants assert an argument\n\ndistinct from their argument pertaining to their sixth issue, appellants do not provide analysis or\n\nauthority for such argument. Therefore, such argument presents nothing for this Court’s review.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Second, appellants assert in their reply brief that “there is no merit to\n\n[appellees’] contention that ‘constructive termination’ is a concept limited to application in the\n\nemployment context.” According to appellants, “constructive termination is a concept that is\n\nrecognized in many types of relationships.” In support of that assertion, appellants cite cases that\n\npurportedly relate to constructive termination in the contexts of franchise agreements, licensing\n\n                                                –37–\n\fagreements, and leases.                 However, appellants do not address the elements of constructive\n\ntermination in their briefs in this Court or explain how appellees’ alleged conduct in question\n\nconstituted constructive termination.                          Consequently, we conclude appellants’ argument\n\nrespecting constructive termination presents nothing for this Court’s review. 11 See TEX. R. CIV.\n\nP. 38.1(i).\n\n           As to declaration “d,” appellants contend that declaration was issued in error because\n\nappellants “presented evidence that raised a fact question as to [appellees’] breach of the 2001\n\nAgreement by undermining and interfering with [appellants’] performance.” In support of that\n\nargument, appellants cite to their analysis pertaining to their sixth issue and the evidence cited\n\ntherein. However, again, to the extent appellants assert an argument distinct from their argument\n\npertaining to their sixth issue, appellants do not provide analysis or authority for such argument\n\nand therefore present nothing for this Court’s review. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n           As to the trial court’s declaration “b,” appellants contend they presented evidence that\n\nraises fact questions as to the termination of the Agreement. Specifically, appellants assert\n\n           [T]he evidence shows that the termination provision requires 90 days’ notice for\n           any termination. Otherwise the 2001 Agreement automatically renews. It is\n           undisputed that 90 days’ notice was not provided by either party. Thus, under the\n           express terms of the 2001 Agreement no termination occurred. At the very least, a\n           fact question exists that should have prevented the trial court from making this\n           declaration.\n\n(citations to record omitted).\n\n           Appellees respond in part that because appellants “cite and analyze no cases for their\n\nposition that the Agreement did not expire in August 2008 as determined,” that argument is\n\nwaived. Additionally, appellees assert (1) “[a]ppellants’ Termination Letter sent 72 days prior\n\nto renewal when coupled with [a]ppellants’ failure to resume performance of the Agreement\n\n    11\n         In oral argument before this Court, counsel for appellants asserted the Agreement was terminated according to its terms on August 29,\n2008.\n\n\n\n                                                                   –38–\n\fprecluded automatic renewal as [a]ppellees under such circumstances are not obligated to require\n\n[a]ppellants to comply with the Agreement’s notice provision”; (2) [a]ppellants’ breach\n\nprecluded the Agreement’s renewal”; and (3) “[n]o fact questions could exist on this point in any\n\nevent” because “[t]he meaning of contract language is a question of law for the court.” In\n\nsupport of their argument, appellees cite cases pertaining to waiver of contract provisions and\n\ncessation of performance due to breach.

App.—San Antonio June 9, 1999, pet. denied) (not designated for publication).\n\n       In their reply brief in this Court, appellants contend in part that “[n]o case law is\n\nnecessary” to resolve this issue in their favor because “it is apparent on the face of the record that\n\nno evidence supports the trial court’s declaration that ‘the Agreement expired by its own terms\n\non August 1, 2008.’”\n\n       Because appellants’ argument is based on the language of the Agreement, we cannot\n\nagree with appellees that appellants waived this argument by not citing case law. Further, the\n\ncases cited by appellees in support of their argument do not involve compliance with a contract\n\nprovision respecting notice that precludes automatic renewal of the contract. Therefore, we do\n\nnot find those cases instructive.\n\n       The record shows paragraph three of the Agreement stated in part, “This Agreement is\n\nfor a term of five years starting August 1, 2001 and is to be renewed annually thereafter unless\n\neither parties [sic] gives notice in writing 90 days prior to the end of any anniversary date.”\n\nBerryman’s letter alleging he had been “constructively terminated” was dated May 20, 2008,\n\n                                                –39–\n\fwhich the parties do not dispute is less than ninety days prior to August 1, 2008. Thus, while the\n\ntrial court’s statement that “Defendants’ Agreement Termination Letter was received by\n\nPlaintiffs in May of 2008” is not incorrect, we cannot agree that “the Agreement expired by its\n\nown terms on August 1, 2008 as a result.” We conclude no evidence supports the trial court’s\n\ndeclaration “b.”\n\n           We decide in favor of appellants on the portion of their fifth issue respecting the trial\n\ncourt’s declaration “b.” Appellants’ fifth issue is otherwise decided against them. We reverse\n\ndeclaration “b” of the trial court’s judgment and render judgment denying summary judgment as\n\nto that declaration.\n\n           However, the record shows (1) the summary judgment in question was sought and\n\ngranted on multiple grounds and (2) declaration “b” is immaterial to summary judgment as\n\nprayed for by appellees on the ground of money had and received and declarations “a,” “c,” and\n\n“d.” Therefore, the trial court’s error respecting declaration “b” does not necessitate reversal of\n\nthe entirety of the trial court’s summary judgment. See Zimmerhanzel, 346 S.W.3d at 724; see\n\nalso TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1.\n\n                                                          6. Attorneys’ Fees\n\n           In their seventh issue, appellants assert in part “the trial court erred in awarding\n\n[a]ppellees attorneys’ fees when [a]ppellees failed to conclusively prove the reasonableness and\n\nnecessity of the claimed fees by not segregating fees incurred for work on causes of action for\n\nwhich such fees are permitted, from causes of action for which such fees are barred.” 12\n\nAccording to appellants, (1) “because [appellees’] cause of action for breach of contract fails, the\n\ntrial court’s award of attorneys’ fees cannot be based on that action,” (2) “[i]t is undisputed that\n\n     12\n        Additionally, appellants contend in their seventh issue that “[a]ppellees’ redundant declaratory judgment action was used simply to pave\na way to attorney fees.” As described above, appellants’ arguments respecting the redundancy of the declaratory judgment action were not raised\nbelow and present nothing for this Court’s review.\n\n\n\n                                                                    –40–\n\f[appellees] presented no evidence segregating the fees incurred in pursuing their claims,” and (3)\n\nno attempt was made to segregate attorneys’ fees incurred in pursuing third-party claims asserted\n\nby Brinkmann, individually, that were later nonsuited.\n\n       Appellees contend appellants “waived any complaint” respecting segregation of\n\nattorneys’ fees because they “did not object to [a]ppellees’ attorneys’ fees evidence or provide\n\ncontroverting evidence.” Further, appellees argue, counsel for appellees testified to the trial\n\ncourt “in great detail” in his affidavit, “including segregating 15 percent of the attorney’s fees\n\nincurred.”\n\n       Texas law does not allow recovery of attorneys’ fees unless authorized by statute or\n\ncontract.

CODE ANN. § 37.009.\n\n       The record shows that in an affidavit in the appendix to appellees’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, counsel for appellees testified in part (1) at least 85%, or $127,073, of the attorneys’\n\nfees and paralegal fees incurred by plaintiffs so far “are recoverable against the [d]efendants in\n\nthis lawsuit”; (2) “it is reasonable to conclude that [plaintiffs’] counsel’s activities cannot all be\n\nsegregated by task and as such are dependent on the same or similar sets of facts and\n\ncircumstances, are part of many of the same tasks, and are therefore so intertwined that they\n\ncannot be so separated or segregated” (3) a fair estimate of additional attorneys’ fees likely be\n\nincurred by plaintiffs through the hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment to\n\nadvance plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims” against defendants is at least $33,875; and (4) in the\n\nevent of appeal respecting plaintiffs’ “affirmative claims,” plaintiffs will likely incur at least an\n\nadditional $35,000 in fees in defense of an appeal to the Dallas Court of Appeals, $20,000 in fees\n\nin briefing an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, and $15,000 in fees if the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt grants a hearing on such appeal. Appellants did not object to this evidence or provide\n\n                                                –42–\n\fcontroverting evidence respecting segregation of attorneys’ fees. On this record, we conclude\n\nappellees met their burden as to segregation of attorneys’ fees. See Tony Gullo Motors, 212\n\nS.W.3d at 313–14; RM Crowe Prop.

Damages, Attorneys’ Fees, Costs, and Interest Awarded to Brinkmann\n\n           Lastly, in their eighth issue, appellants contend “the trial court erred in entering judgment\n\nin favor of [Brinkmann], individually, when he did not recover on any cause of action.”\n\nAppellants assert that at the time the final judgment was entered, Brinkmann “was not a party to\n\nthe affirmative causes of action on which judgment was entered.” According to appellants,\n\n“[t]he trial court’s judgment must be reversed because it awarded damages, attorneys’ fees, costs\n\nand interest to an individual who was not a party to any cause of action on which those amounts\n\nwere awarded.”\n\n           Appellees “agree that the final judgment should be modified so Brinkmann individually\n\nis removed from the award of damages or fees because he never requested that relief.”\n\nSpecifically, appellees contend in a footnote in their appellate brief\n\n           The Final Judgment provides for recovery of damages and fees to “Movants”\n           collectively, which was a defined term that included both Plaintiffs/Appellees as\n           well as Third Party Defendant/Brinkmann individually.
