For the reasons set forth below, we will\n\nsummarily affirm. See Third Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6.\n\f                                               I.\n\n          While Fiore was imprisoned at the United States Penitentiary in Waymart,\n\nPennsylvania (“USP-Canaan”), he filed the § 2241 petition at issue in this appeal.1\n\nHowever, his claims arose from incidents which took place at the Federal Medical Center\n\nin Fort Devens, Massachusetts (“FMC-Devens”), his previous place of confinement. In\n\nthe petition, Fiore raised four claims: 1) his due process rights were violated during\n\ndisciplinary proceedings related to Incident Report No. 1330650; 2) his due process rights\n\nwere violated during disciplinary proceedings related to Incident Report No. 1466880;\n\n3) prison officials unlawfully subjected him to retaliation and harassment as a result of\n\nthose two incidents; and 4) during his administrative detention pending resolution of\n\nIncident Report No. 1330650, prison officials failed to provide him with a complete copy\n\nof the prison handbook and related materials in violation of Bureau of Prison (“BOP”)\n\npolicy.\n\n          As relief, Fiore sought to have the two disciplinary actions expunged from his\n\nrecord and 27 days of good time credit restored. The District Court denied Fiore’s\n\npetition after determining that his claims were either without merit or not cognizable on\n\nfederal habeas review. Fiore subsequently appealed the ruling.\n\n\n\n\n          1\n        While Fiore’s habeas petition was pending in the District Court, he was\ntransferred to the Stratford County Prison in Dover, New Hampshire.\n\n                                               2\n\f                                             II.\n\n       We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2253(a). A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal from the denial of\n\nFiore’s § 2241 petition. See Burkey v. Marberry, 556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir. 2009). We\n\nexercise plenary review over the District Court's legal conclusions, and review its factual\n\nfindings for clear error. See Vega v. United States, 493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir. 2007).\n\n                                            III.\n\n       A.     Due Process Claims\n\n              I.     Incident Report No. 1330650\n\n       On April 11, 2005, Senior Officer Specialist Lieutenant A. Colon issued Incident\n\nReport No. 1330650 (“IR 1330650\") charging Fiore with fighting with another person in\n\nviolation of BOP disciplinary code 201. This misconduct charge stemmed from a January\n\n15, 2005 altercation between Fiore and another inmate at FMC-Devens. On May 18,\n\n2005, prison officials conducted an administrative hearing and, thereafter, ruled that Fiore\n\nviolated code 201. He was sanctioned to a 27-day loss of good time credit.\n\n       Fiore alleged that his due process rights were violated at various stages during the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. Specifically, he claimed that Lieutenant Colon violated his\n\nrights when he failed to: 1) read him his rights before taking his statement regarding the\n\nincident; 2) record his statement; 3) allow him to sign a written version of his statement;\n\n4) timely serve him with a copy of IR 1330650; and 5) issue IR 1330650 in a timely\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fmanner as required by BOP regulations. In addition, Fiore claimed that the Disciplinary\n\nHearing Officer assigned to his case (DHO Bracy) violated his rights by: 1) refusing his\n\nrequest to dismiss the disciplinary charge for failure of correctional officer staff to follow\n\ninstitutional policy; and 2) failing to “audio record” the administrative hearing.\n\n       It is well established that \"prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal\n\nprosecution, and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not\n\napply.\" Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 556 (1974). The Supreme Court has,\n\nhowever, recognized a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings when, as in this case, a prisoner's good-time credit is at stake.\n\nSpecifically, when good-time credit is at stake, a prisoner is entitled to: 1) appear before\n\nan impartial decision-making body; 2) twenty-four hour advance notice of the charges;\n\n3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; 4) assistance from\n\na representative; and 5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied upon. Id. at\n\n563-71. \"Revocation of good time does not comport with the minimum requirements of\n\nprocedural due process unless the findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported\n\nby some evidence in the record.\" Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445,\n\n454 (1985).\n\n       Upon review of the record, we agree with the District Court that Fiore received all\n\nthe process he was due during the disciplinary proceedings. The record reveals that Fiore\n\nwas given 24 hours notice of the charges against him in accordance with 28 C.F.R.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f541.17(a); that he was provided the opportunity to call witnesses and present\n\ndocumentary evidence in his defense; and that he was issued a written decision setting\n\nforth the evidence relied on, and reasons for, the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S.\n\nat 563-67.\n\n       Furthermore, the DHO's findings were clearly supported by \"some\" evidence in the\n\nrecord. In his report, DHO Bracy noted that his decision was based upon Lieutenant\n\nColon’s detailed incident report and a physician’s report dated January 15, 2005, which\n\nrevealed that Fiore sustained injuries consistent with the reported incident.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that this evidence is sufficient to support the\n\noutcome of the hearing, and meets the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause.\n\nSee Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.2\n\n              II.    Incident Report No. 1466880\n\n       On May 13, 2006, Lieutenant Colon issued Incident Report No. 1466880 against\n\nFiore charging him with insolence toward a staff member in violation of BOP disciplinary\n\ncode 312. Following an administrative hearing, the DHO ruled that Fiore violated code\n\n312. As a result, Fiore was sanctioned to 10 days of disciplinary segregation, three\n\nmonths loss of commissary privileges, and 3 months loss of social telephone privileges.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        We need not reach Fiore's allegations that the prison failed to follow certain other\nBOP guidelines because, as discussed above, such failure will not result in a due process\nviolation as long as Fiore was provided with the process he is due under Wolff.\n\n                                              5\n\fAgain, Fiore claimed that his due process rights had been violated during the\n\nadministrative process.\n\n       The District Court correctly determined that this claim was not appropriate for\n\nfederal habeas review. While the Due Process Clause protects against the revocation of\n\ngood time credit, it does not provide the same level of protection against the other forms\n\nof discipline that Fiore received. See Torres v. Fauver, 292 F.3d 141, 150-51 (3d Cir.\n\n2002) (citing Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995)). Based upon a review of the\n\nundisputed record, Fiore was not sanctioned to a loss of good time credits in connection\n\nwith Incident Report No. 1466880. Furthermore, as the District Court aptly pointed out,\n\nFiore acknowledged in his habeas petition that the incident report could not be addressed\n\nin a § 2241 petition. Accordingly, the District Court properly denied this claim.\n\n       B.     Harassment and Retaliation Claims\n\n       Lastly, Fiore claimed that he was unlawfully retaliated against and harassed by\n\nprison staff during his stay in FMC-Devens’ Special Housing Unit pending the\n\ninvestigation of IR1330650. Specifically, Fiore claims that his mail was interfered with\n\nand he was given a retaliatory job reassignment. He also claimed that he was ultimately\n\ntransferred from FMC-Devens to another correctional facility in retaliation for various\n\nconflicts with prison staff.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that these claims are not cognizable in a § 2241\n\npetition. They do not present a challenge to the fact or length of Fiore’s conviction, see\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fLeamer v. Fauver, 288 F.3d 532, 542 (3d Cir. 2002), nor do they challenge the manner of\n\nits execution, see Woodall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 432 F.3d 235, 243 (3d Cir. 2005)\n\n(indicating that while certain types of transfers may give rise to habeas claims, \"a garden\n\nvariety prison transfer\" would not).\n\n       As Fiore’s appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm. See\n\nThird Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Fiore’s motion to hold the case in abeyance is denied\n\nas moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f",

Due Process Claims\n\n              I.     Incident Report No. 1330650\n\n       On April 11, 2005, Senior Officer Specialist Lieutenant A. Colon issued Incident\n\nReport No. 1330650 (“IR 1330650\") charging Fiore with fighting with another person in\n\nviolation of BOP disciplinary code 201. This misconduct charge stemmed from a January\n\n15, 2005 altercation between Fiore and another inmate at FMC-Devens. On May 18,\n\n2005, prison officials conducted an administrative hearing and, thereafter, ruled that Fiore\n\nviolated code 201. He was sanctioned to a 27-day loss of good time credit.\n\n       Fiore alleged that his due process rights were violated at various stages during the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings. Specifically, he claimed that Lieutenant Colon violated his\n\nrights when he failed to: 1) read him his rights before taking his statement regarding the\n\nincident; 2) record his statement; 3) allow him to sign a written version of his statement;\n\n4) timely serve him with a copy of IR 1330650; and 5) issue IR 1330650 in a timely\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fmanner as required by BOP regulations. In addition, Fiore claimed that the Disciplinary\n\nHearing Officer assigned to his case (DHO Bracy) violated his rights by: 1) refusing his\n\nrequest to dismiss the disciplinary charge for failure of correctional officer staff to follow\n\ninstitutional policy; and 2) failing to “audio record” the administrative hearing.\n\n       It is well established that \"prison disciplinary proceedings are not part of a criminal\n\nprosecution, and the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such proceedings does not\n\napply.\" Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 556 (1974). The Supreme Court has,\n\nhowever, recognized a set of minimum procedural protections that must apply to prison\n\ndisciplinary proceedings when, as in this case, a prisoner's good-time credit is at stake.\n\nSpecifically, when good-time credit is at stake, a prisoner is entitled to: 1) appear before\n\nan impartial decision-making body; 2) twenty-four hour advance notice of the charges;\n\n3) an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary evidence; 4) assistance from\n\na representative; and 5) a written decision explaining the evidence relied upon. Id. at\n\n563-71. \"Revocation of good time does not comport with the minimum requirements of\n\nprocedural due process unless the findings of the prison disciplinary board are supported\n\nby some evidence in the record.\" Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111476\"><a href=\"/opinion/111476/superintendent-mass-correctional-institution-at-walpole-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n454 (1985).\n\n       Upon review of the record, we agree with the District Court that Fiore received all\n\nthe process he was due during the disciplinary proceedings. The record reveals that Fiore\n\nwas given 24 hours notice of the charges against him in accordance with 28 C.F.R.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f541.17(a); that he was provided the opportunity to call witnesses and present\n\ndocumentary evidence in his defense; and that he was issued a written decision setting\n\nforth the evidence relied on, and reasons for, the disciplinary action. See Wolff, 418 U.S.\n\nat 563-67.\n\n       Furthermore, the DHO's findings were clearly supported by \"some\" evidence in the\n\nrecord. In his report, DHO Bracy noted that his decision was based upon Lieutenant\n\nColon’s detailed incident report and a physician’s report dated January 15, 2005, which\n\nrevealed that Fiore sustained injuries consistent with the reported incident.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that this evidence is sufficient to support the\n\noutcome of the hearing, and meets the requirements imposed by the Due Process Clause.\n\nSee Hill, 472 U.S. at 454.2\n\n              II.    Incident Report No. 1466880\n\n       On May 13, 2006, Lieutenant Colon issued Incident Report No. 1466880 against\n\nFiore charging him with insolence toward a staff member in violation of BOP disciplinary\n\ncode 312. Following an administrative hearing, the DHO ruled that Fiore violated code\n\n312. As a result, Fiore was sanctioned to 10 days of disciplinary segregation, three\n\nmonths loss of commissary privileges, and 3 months loss of social telephone privileges.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        We need not reach Fiore's allegations that the prison failed to follow certain other\nBOP guidelines because, as discussed above, such failure will not result in a due process\nviolation as long as Fiore was provided with the process he is due under Wolff.\n\n                                              5\n\fAgain, Fiore claimed that his due process rights had been violated during the\n\nadministrative process.\n\n       The District Court correctly determined that this claim was not appropriate for\n\nfederal habeas review. While the Due Process Clause protects against the revocation of\n\ngood time credit, it does not provide the same level of protection against the other forms\n\nof discipline that Fiore received. See Torres v. Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777862\"><a href=\"/opinion/777862/antonio-torres-v-william-fauver-new-jersey-commissioner-of-corrections-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150-51 (3d Cir.\n\n2002) (citing Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486 (1995)). Based upon a review of the\n\nundisputed record, Fiore was not sanctioned to a loss of good time credits in connection\n\nwith Incident Report No. 1466880. Furthermore, as the District Court aptly pointed out,\n\nFiore acknowledged in his habeas petition that the incident report could not be addressed\n\nin a § 2241 petition. Accordingly, the District Court properly denied this claim.\n\n       B.     Harassment and Retaliation Claims\n\n       Lastly, Fiore claimed that he was unlawfully retaliated against and harassed by\n\nprison staff during his stay in FMC-Devens’ Special Housing Unit pending the\n\ninvestigation of IR1330650. Specifically, Fiore claims that his mail was interfered with\n\nand he was given a retaliatory job reassignment. He also claimed that he was ultimately\n\ntransferred from FMC-Devens to another correctional facility in retaliation for various\n\nconflicts with prison staff.\n\n       We agree with the District Court that these claims are not cognizable in a § 2241\n\npetition. They do not present a challenge to the fact or length of Fiore’s conviction, see\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fLeamer v.

See\n\nThird Cir. LAR 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. Fiore’s motion to hold the case in abeyance is denied\n\nas moot.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f</pre>",
