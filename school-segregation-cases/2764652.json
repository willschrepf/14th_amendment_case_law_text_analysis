Procedural and Factual Background</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed, the trustee in bankruptcy for Craig Black d/b/a Allied Bonding Agency, a bail\r\nbondsman, filed suit against Bowles and Dallas County challenging two different bail bond\r\nprocessing fees levied by the Dallas County Commissioner's Court, and sought four times that\r\nsum as a penalty under former article 3909,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> prejudgment interest, costs of court, and attorney's\r\nfees.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Bowles and Dallas County filed an equitable setoff claim in response.  Following a trial\r\nbefore the bench on stipulated facts, the trial court rendered judgment against both Bowles and\r\nDallas County.  The court denied the defendants their requested setoff relief.  Bowles and Dallas\r\nCounty were found to be jointly and severally liable for $316,387 in actual damages; $23,729.02\r\nin prejudgment interest; court costs; $25,000 in attorneys' fees for trial work; additional\r\ncompensation in the event of appeal; and postjudgment interest calculated at 10% per year. \r\nBowles was found separately liable for $949,161 in damages, plus $71,187.08 in prejudgment\r\ninterest.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On December 1, 1981, the Commissioner's Court began to charge a fee for every bail bond\r\nprocessed by the Dallas County Sheriff.  The following chart indicates the amount of the fee for\r\nthe relevant time periods:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Order No.<span>                </span>Effective Date<span>          </span>Fee Amount</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>81-1865<span>                   </span>12-01-81<span>                  </span>$13 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>82-1227<span>                   </span>09-01-82<span>                  </span>$14 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>83-1301<span>                   </span>10-01-83<span>                  </span>$15 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>85-1508<span>                   </span>10-01-85<span>                  </span>$18 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>86-120 <span>                    </span>02-01-86<span>                  </span>$19 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>87-1500<span>                   </span>01-01-88<span>                  </span>$30 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>88-674 <span>                    </span>05-02-88<span>                  </span>No fee</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>89-960 <span>                    </span>06-08-89<span>                  </span>$30 per bond</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Bowles also collected a $28 fee for filing an affidavit to go off bail (ATGOB) during the period\r\nof February 15, 1989, to June 17, 1992.  The record indicates that, during the relevant time\r\nperiods, Bowles collected from Black $471,999 in bond fees and $952 in ATGOB fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The orders for the bond fees were enacted pursuant to former article 3926(a), which\r\nprovided that a commissioner's court could set reasonable fees to be charged by sheriffs and\r\nconstables.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The ATGOB fees were neither authorized nor approved by the Commissioner's\r\nCourt.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On May 6, 1992, the Texas Supreme Court held that a preconviction bail bond fee levied\r\nby the El Paso County Commissioner's Court (a fee similar to the one imposed by the Dallas\r\nCounty Commissioner's Court) was not authorized by any Texas statute.  <i>Camacho v. Samaniego</i>,\r\n831 S.W.2d 804, 815 (Tex. 1992).  Specifically, the Court found article 3926a, and its successor\r\nstatute, section 118.131(a) of the Local Government Code, inapplicable to criminal law matters\r\nand held that no article of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a commissioner's court\r\nmay order the sheriff to collect a fee for the execution of a bail bond.  <i>Id.</i> at 814-15.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In accordance with <i>Camacho</i>, the trial court held the orders from the Dallas County\r\nCommissioner's Court mandating the collection of the bond fees to be unauthorized and assessed\r\nliability for the unlawfully collected fees against both Bowles and Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>II.  Whether Bowles and Dallas County are Immune</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In appellants' first point of error, they assert that both Bowles and Dallas County cannot\r\nbe subject to liability because they are entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity.  We sustain\r\nthe point with regard to Bowles but overrule it with regard to Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the outset we note that the trial court rendered judgment against Dallas County and\r\n\"Defendant Jim Bowles.\"  Thus, the court does not make it clear that Bowles is liable only in his\r\nofficial, or representative, capacity and not his individual capacity.  Such a distinction was not\r\nnecessary, however, because Reed sued Bowles solely in his official capacity.  By suing Bowles\r\nsolely in his official capacity, Reed has, in effect, made her suit solely against the governmental\r\nentity on whose behalf Bowles acted, Dallas County.  <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sharp</i>, 874 S.W.2d\r\n736, 738 (Tex. App—Austin 1994, writ denied); <i>Whitehead v. University of Texas Health Science\r\nCenter at San Antonio</i>, 854 S.W.2d 175, 179-80 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1993, no writ);\r\n<i>Esparza v. Diaz</i>, 802 S.W.2d 772, 778 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The question before us, then, is whether Bowles is immune from suit in his official\r\ncapacity.  The doctrine of legislative immunity protects commissioner's courts from liability when\r\nthey act in their legislative capacity.  <i>Merrill v. Carpenter</i>, 867 S.W.2d 65, 68 (Tex. App.—Fort\r\nWorth 1993, writ denied).  Sheriffs share in this legislative immunity when they enforce an order\r\nissued by a commissioner's court in its legislative capacity.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <i>Id.</i>  Moreover, this immunity applies\r\nto the sheriff in both his individual and his official capacities.  <i>See id.</i>  Here, Bowles was\r\nenforcing an order of the Dallas County Commissioner's Court issued in its legislative capacity. \r\nTherefore, Bowles shares in that same legislative immunity in his official capacity.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed contends this case differs from <i>Merrill</i> because the trial court here found the bond\r\nfees not only to be unauthorized but also to constitute a taking in violation of the Texas\r\nConstitution.  <span>Tex. Const.</span> art. I, § 17.  By raising the illegality to the constitutional level, argues\r\nReed, Bowles cannot be protected by sovereign immunity.  Article I, section 17, however, is\r\ninapplicable because the collection of the bond fees is not a taking as provided in that provision. \r\n<i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  Therefore, no constitutional violation occurred.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed also contends article 3909 waives Bowles' sovereign immunity; this argument need\r\nnot be addressed because Bowles did not extort anything as provided in article 3909.  <i>Vannerson\r\nv. Klevenhagen</i>, No. 01-93-395-CV, slip op. at 6-7 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.], September\r\n14, 1995, n.w.h.) (on rehearing); <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  Bowles, in collecting the bond fee,\r\nwas merely executing a legislative order issued by the Dallas County Commissioner's Court.  As\r\nthe Sheriff of Dallas County, he was obligated to execute the order.  While the bond fee, itself,\r\nmay have been illegal, Bowles did not unlawfully demand or receive it.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at\r\n7.  Therefore, we need not decide whether article 3909 waived Bowles' sovereign immunity\r\nbecause Bowles did not violate the provisions of article 3909 in collecting the bond fee.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed argues that state agents are not immune from liability if they act outside the scope of\r\ntheir authority.  <i>See Hale v. Colorado River Mun. Water Dist.</i>, 818 S.W.2d 537, 539 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Austin 1991, no writ).  She contends that, because the collection of these bond fees was\r\nnot authorized by law, they constituted an unlawful taking under the constitution and, since Bowles\r\nthereby violated constitutional rights in collecting the fees, he acted outside the scope of his\r\nauthority.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Bowles, however, was acting within his authority in executing the orders of the\r\ncommissioner's court.  <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  He bore no duty to examine the\r\nconstitutionality or the legality of the statute.  <i>See Pierson v. Ray</i>, 386 U.S. 547, 555, 87 S.Ct.\r\n1213, 1218 (1967); <i>Rains v. Crow</i>, 601 S.W.2d 774, 775 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1980, writ\r\nref'd n.r.e.)  Therefore, Bowles is protected by sovereign immunity because he did not act outside\r\nthe scope of his authority.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed further asserts that Bowles is not entitled to official or quasi-judicial immunity\r\nbecause his actions were ministerial, not discretionary.  Reed argues that only when a state agent's\r\nacts involve the exercise of discretion can he be entitled to the sovereign immunity defense.  Her\r\nargument regarding official immunity is misplaced because Bowles need not claim official\r\nimmunity.  The official immunity doctrine applies only when a state agent is sued in his individual\r\ncapacity.  Bowles was sued only in his official or representative capacity; therefore, any reliance\r\nupon an official immunity argument is inapposite.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Concerning the quasi-judicial immunity doctrine, Reed similarly argues that Bowles is not\r\nentitled to protection under it because the doctrine only protects discretionary acts while his were\r\nministerial.  <i>See Carpenter v. Barner</i>, 797 S.W.2d 99, 101 (Tex. App.—Waco 1990, writ denied). \r\nWe note, however, that Bowles is immune under the legislative immunity doctrine.  Consequently,\r\nwe need not address the question of whether Bowles is immune under the quasi-judicial immunity\r\ndoctrine.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Our discussion thus far on Bowles' liability for the collection of the bond fees has centered\r\nexclusively on the bond fees, not the ATGOB fees.  The ATGOB fees raise another question.  As\r\nstated above, Bowles was legislatively immune in his representative capacity from incurring any\r\nliability as a result of his collection of the bond fees.  <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  He obtained this\r\nimmunity because the Commissioner's Court, acting in its legislative capacity, ordered him to\r\ncollect the fees.  <i>Id.</i>  The ATGOB fees, however, were collected by Bowles without any\r\nauthorization from the Commissioner's Court.  Accordingly, Bowles is liable for the ATGOB fees. \r\nHowever, as Bowles was sued solely in his representative capacity, he can only be liable in his\r\nrepresentative capacity.  <i>Liberty Mut.</i>, 874 S.W.2d at 738.  Appellants' first point with regard to\r\nBowles is sustained with regard to the bond, but not the ATBOB, fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Dallas County contends the trial court erred in failing to find it protected from liability\r\nunder the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  The bail bond fees ordered by the Dallas County\r\nCommissioner's Court have been characterized as a \"tax of sorts,\" and that counties are not\r\nimmune from liability for the assessment of an unauthorized tax.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at 8;\r\n<i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  The <i>Vannerson</i> and <i>Merrill</i> courts also found that this type of bond\r\nfee is necessarily paid under duress because the \"taxpayers\" were unable to conduct their bail bond\r\nbusiness without paying the fee.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at 8; <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  We agree\r\nwith <i>Vannerson</i> and <i>Merrill</i> that the bond fee was a tax and that it was assessed against Reed under\r\nduress.  Therefore, Dallas County is liable, and appellants' first point of error is overruled insofar\r\nas it relates to Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>III.  What, if any, Statute of Limitations Should Apply</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their fourth point of error, appellants complain the trial court erred in applying a four-year instead of a two-year statute of limitations to Reed's claims.  In addition to arguing against\r\nthe point, Reed also filed a cross-claim on the issue, alleging no statute of limitations should apply\r\nto the unlawful taking of fees by a governmental entity.  We hold that a two-year statute of\r\nlimitations should apply.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed contends this point was waived by appellants because they neglected to request any\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court on their defense of limitations.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>August Dev. Co. v. Fish Oil Well Serv.</i>, 761 S.W.2d 538, 542 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988,\r\nno writ).  Appellants were not required to request any findings on the issue to preserve it for\r\nappellate review.  Appellants raised the limitations issue in an amended answer to the plaintiff's\r\npetition.  In the stipulated facts, the amount of funds collected by Bowles from Allied Bonding\r\nAgency was broken down year-by-year.  The trial court's judgment reveals that it granted Reed\r\nactual and four-fold damages for the four years preceding Allied Bonding Agency's filing of\r\nbankruptcy on October 1, 1991.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Appellants again raised the issue in their \"Motion For New Trial\r\nand to set Aside Judgment; Alternatively, to Amend, and/or Modify Judgment\" filed on January\r\n4, 1994.  The motion was denied on January 27, 1994.  From these facts, we conclude the point\r\nwas preserved by appellants.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed complains in her cross-point that no statute of limitations should apply to her suit\r\nagainst appellants.  She cites two cases in support of her argument, neither of which is applicable. \r\nShe contends that <i>Ratcliff v. City of Hurst</i>, 593 S.W.2d 863 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1980, writ\r\ndenied), held that \"no limitations period applied to [a] taxpayer's suit seeking reimbursement from\r\nmunicipal ad valorem taxes received by the City of Hurst for periods in which it had no right of\r\ncollection.\"  At issue in <i>Ratcliff</i> was the payment of ad valorem taxes to the city of Hurst by\r\npeople who lived in an area that the city claimed to have previously annexed.  <i>Id.</i> at 864.  The\r\n<i>Ratcliff</i> court held that no limitations period should be applied to the plaintiffs in its case because\r\nthey at no time possessed standing to contest the annexation of the land upon which they lived. \r\n<i>Id.</i>  Here, Black was able to contest the legality of the bond fees and the ATGOB fees at any time. \r\nTherefore, <i>Ratcliff</i> is inapposite.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed cites <i>National Biscuit Co. v. State</i>, 135 S.W.2d 687 (Tex. 1940) (hereafter <i>Nabisco</i>),\r\nfor the proposition that limitations cannot bar a taxpayer's cause of action when he continued to\r\npay an illegal tax without requesting a judicial ascertainment of the invalidity of the tax.  In\r\n<i>Nabisco</i>, the Texas Supreme Court held that laches did not bar the plaintiff's claim to recover\r\ntaxes paid under a statute later found to be unconstitutional when the statutory penalties for failure\r\nto pay the tax were unduly severe.  <i>Id.</i> at 693.  The Court held that a taxpayer could not contest\r\na tax he paid voluntarily, although he could contest one paid under duress.  <i>Id.</i>  Nabisco, in facing\r\nthe prospect of litigation, would then have been forced to make a choice between not paying the\r\ntax, which would ensure its standing to sue, or paying the tax and hoping the court would find that\r\nit was paid under duress.  <i>Id.</i>  The penalties, however, for failing to pay the tax were severe.  <i>Id.</i> \r\nThey were:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>1.  A fine of 25% of such taxes exacted;</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>2.  If the amount of such taxes and penalties was not paid in full on or before the next July\r\n1 following default, the corporation forfeited its right to do business in Texas.  This\r\nforfeiture was consummated without any judicial action, but simply by the Secretary of\r\nState entering a notation on the proper record to that effect; and</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>3.  After the forfeiture entry, the corporation affected thereby was denied the right to do\r\nbusiness in Texas and was denied the right to sue or defend any action in the courts of\r\nTexas, although with certain exceptions.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Id.</i> at 692.  Considering the severity of the penalties, the Court held that Nabisco was not guilty\r\nof laches in continuing to pay the tax for an extended period of time instead of contesting it in the\r\ncourts.  <i>Id.</i> at 693.  No such statutory penalties would have been visited upon Black while he\r\ncontested the legality of the bond and ATGOB fees; therefore, <i>Nabisco</i> is also inapposite.  Reed's\r\ncross-point is overruled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Section 16.003 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code establishes a two-year limitations\r\nperiod for the taking, detaining, or converting of another's personal property.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 16.003(a) (Vernon 1986).  Reed sued appellants for extorting Black's\r\npersonal property, namely, his money, through the bond fees and ATGOB fees.  <i>Falls County v.\r\nMires</i>, 218 S.W.2d 491, 494 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1949, writ ref'd) (in construing the\r\npredecessor statute to section 16.003(a), the court held a two-year statute of limitations applicable\r\nto a county treasurer's claim that the county failed to pay him the salary owed him by law); <i>see\r\nArquette v. Hancock</i>, 656 S.W.2d 627, 629 (Tex. App—San Antonio 1983, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (two-year statute of limitations applies to the unlawful collection by a constable of a criminal fine).  We\r\nfind Reed's extortion claim is a claim for the unlawful conversion of his property and, therefore,\r\nthe two-year statute of limitations under section 16.003(a) applies.  Appellants' fourth point is\r\nsustained.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>IV.  Whether <i>Camacho</i> Should Be Applied Retroactively</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their third point of error appellants allege the <i>Camacho</i> decision should be applied only\r\nprospectively.  They refer to a three-part test adopted by the Texas Supreme Court to determine\r\nwhether a decision striking down a particular statute should be applied both retroactively and\r\nprospectively or only prospectively.  The test provides as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>First, the decision to be applied nonretroactively must establish a new principle of law,\r\neither by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, or by deciding\r\nan issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>Second, . . . [the court] must . . . weigh the merits and demerits in each case by looking\r\nto the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether\r\nretrospective operation will further or retard its operation.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>Finally, [the court must] weig[h] the inequity imposed by retroactive application, for where\r\na decision of [the court] could produce substantial inequitable results if applied\r\nretroactively, there is ample basis in our cases for avoiding the injustice or hardship by a\r\nholding of nonretroactivity.  </span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><i>Carrollton-Farmers Branch Ind. Sch. Dist. v. Edgewood Ind. Sch. Dist.</i>, 826 S.W.2d 489, 518\r\n(Tex. 1992) (quoting <i>Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson</i>, 404 U.S. 97, 106-07, 92 S.Ct. 349, 355 (1971)).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Notwithstanding the three factors listed in <i>Carrollton-Farmers Branch</i>, we hold that the\r\n<i>Camacho</i> decision should be applied retroactively because the Texas Supreme Court applied it\r\nretroactively to the parties in that case.  The United States Supreme Court has held that when it\r\ndecides a case and applies the new legal rule of that case to the parties before it then it and other\r\ncourts must treat that same new rule as retroactive, that is, applying it to all pending cases,\r\nwhether or not those cases involve predecision events.  <i>Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde</i>, — U.S.\r\n—, 115 S.Ct. 1745, 1748 (1995) (citing <i>Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation</i>, 509 U.S.—,  113\r\nS.Ct. 2510, 2517 (1993));<i> James B. Bean Distilling Co. v. Georgia</i>, 501 U.S. 529, 540, 111 S.Ct.\r\n2439, 2446 (1991) (plurality opinion).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Texas Supreme Court, while not specifically adopting the rule of law stated in <i>Harper</i>,\r\nhas recently reached the same conclusion.  In <i>Ellis County State Bank v. Keever</i>, 888 S.W.2d 790\r\n(Tex. 1994), the Court was faced with the question of whether its decision in <i>Transportation Ins.\r\nCo. v. Moriel</i>, 879 S.W.2d 10 (Tex. 1994), should be applied retroactively.  The Court held that\r\nit should be applied retroactively to all pending cases in which a party had preserved a complaint\r\nthat the court of appeals failed to properly scrutinize a punitive damages award.  <i>Keever</i>, 888\r\nS.W.2d at 798.  The reasoning used by the <i>Keever</i> court is the same reasoning used by the United\r\nStates Supreme Court in <i>Hyde</i> and <i>James B. Bean Distilling</i>; i.e., when an appellate court creates\r\na new rule of law in a case and applies it retroactively to the parties in that case, then that same\r\nrule of law should be applied retroactively to all other parties similarly situated.  <i>See Bowen v.\r\nAetna Cas. and Sur. Co.</i>, 837 S.W.2d 99, 100 (Tex. 1992) (per curiam) (decisions of the Texas\r\nSupreme Court operate retroactively unless the court expressly exercises its discretion to make the\r\njudgment prospective only).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In <i>Camacho</i> the Texas Supreme Court fashioned a \"new\" rule of law that a bond fee\r\nordered by the El Paso County Commissioner's court was without statutory authorization and then\r\nheld that El Paso County was liable retroactively to the parties in the case from whom it had\r\nreceived the fee in the past.  <i>Camacho</i>, 831 S.W.2d at 815 (judgment rendered in favor of the\r\nplaintiff bailbondsmen).  Therefore, following the same reasoning in <i>Keever</i> and <i>Hyde</i>, we\r\nconclude the holding in <i>Camacho</i> should be applied retroactively to all parties similarly situated\r\nto those in <i>Camacho</i>.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>V.  Whether the Trial Court Erred in Failing to Consider Appellants' Pass-On Defense</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their second point of error, appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to find them\r\nentitled to their \"pass-on\" defense.  In a pass-on defense, a defendant in a tort action alleges the\r\nplaintiff suffered no monetary damages because he simply passed-on any charges assessed against\r\nhim to some other party.  <i>See Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois</i>, 431 U.S. 720, 724-25, 97 S.Ct. 2061,\r\n2064 (1977); <i>Abbott Lab., Inc. v. Segura</i>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 961, 963-64 (June 29, 1995).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In response, Reed contends appellants waived their second point of error by failing to\r\naffirmatively plead their pass-on defense.  She cites <i>Swofford v. Tri-State Chemicals, Inc.</i>, 764\r\nS.W.2d 24 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1989, writ denied), for the proposition that an affirmative defense\r\nmust be plead <i>in the defendant's answer</i> to be able to argue the defense on appeal.  <i>Swofford</i>,\r\nhowever, stands for nothing of the sort.  <i>Swofford</i>, citing Rule 52(a) of the Rules of Appellate\r\nProcedure, simply holds that arguments may not be made for the first time on appeal.  Here,\r\nappellants, although not raising the pass-on defense in either its original answer or its amended\r\nanswer, did raise it to the trial court in a trial brief.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Affirmative defenses may be tried by consent even if not properly pleaded.  <i>Rodeheaver\r\nv. Steigerwald</i>, 807 S.W.2d 790, 792 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1991, writ denied), <i>cert.\r\ndenied</i>, 502 U.S. 1093, 112 S.Ct. 1167 (1992).  When the defense at issue is not properly pleaded\r\nbut is brought before the trial court by the active assistance of both parties, it will be considered\r\nto have been properly raised to the trial court.  <i>Id.</i>  Here, the pass-on defense was raised in\r\nappellants' trial brief.  Moreover, facts bearing upon the pass-on defense were asserted in the\r\nstipulations filed in the trial court.  The relevant portion of the stipulations reads as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>The parties agree that the amount of Bail Bond Approval Fees and Affidavits To Go Off\r\nBail fees that Ralph C. Black, d/b/a Allied Bonding Agency was required to pay to Dallas\r\nCounty as part of his business of issuing bail bonds to criminal defendants were taken into\r\naccount by Mr. Black in setting the rates he charged his clients for his services.  However,\r\nparties are not in agreement as to the relevancy of this fact or the impact which such fact\r\nhas on the issues in this case.  Therefore, the parties have agreed to state their respective\r\npositions as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>1.  It is the Plaintiff's position that the fact that Mr. Black was either paid in\r\nadvance or reimbursed by any of the persons for whom he posted bail bond\r\napproval fees that were required of him, and collected from him by Sheriff Bowles\r\nand received by Dallas County, has absolutely no bearing on the Defendant's\r\nliability to refund any legal fees which were charged to Mr. Black due to the fact\r\nthat he had to pay the fees himself and that payment of such fees were necessary\r\nin order for Mr. Black to operate as a bail bondsman in Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>2.  It is the Defendants' contention that the fact that Ralph Black d/b/a Allied\r\nBonding Agency was either paid in advance or was reimbursed by any persons for\r\nwhom he posted Bail Bond Approval Fees that were required of him, and collected\r\n. . . by Sheriff Bowles, and received by Dallas County, shows that Mr. Black has\r\nbeen fully paid and/or reimbursed for all monies which he posted as bail approval\r\nfees and thus sustained no economic losses as a result of posting those fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Considering the stipulations and the fact that the defense was raised in appellants' trial brief, we\r\nhold the defense was tried by consent.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants contend the trial court erred in failing to consider the pass-on defense.  No\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law were filed by the trial court to indicate either that it rejected\r\nthe pass-on defense as a viable theory in Texas or that it accepted the theory but found the facts\r\ninsufficient to support the defense.  From the judgment, we know that the trial court did not\r\nconsider the defense meritorious because it in no way affected the amount of the damages.  We\r\nwill presume the trial court accepted the pass-on defense as a viable theory but then, sitting as the\r\ntrier of fact, failed to find that appellants had produced sufficient evidence to establish its\r\napplicability.  <i>See Burnett v. Motyka</i>, 610 S.W.2d 735, 736 (Tex. 1980) (per curiam) (\"In a\r\nnonjury trial, where no findings of fact or conclusions of law are filed or requested, it will be\r\nimplied that the trial court made all the necessary findings to support its judgment.\")  We will,\r\ntherefore, examine the trial court's ruling to determine whether appellants proved their defense\r\nat trial as a matter of law.  <i>See Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</i>, 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>A party attempting to overcome an adverse fact finding in which he has the burden of proof\r\nas a matter of law must, first, examine the record for evidence that supports the fact finder's\r\nfindings while ignoring all evidence to the contrary, and, second, if there is no evidence to support\r\nthe fact finder's answer, then the entire record must be examined to see if the contrary position\r\nis established as a matter of law.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Under the pass-on defense, appellants bore the burden of establishing which portion of the\r\nillegally assessed fee was passed on to Black's customers.  <i>See Abbott Lab.</i>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J.\r\nat 964 n.4.  The above-quoted stipulation of facts reveals that appellants did not attempt to\r\napportion the amount of funds Black allegedly passed on to his clients.  Instead, they attempted\r\nto demonstrate that Black passed on to his clients the entire amount of the bond fees.  In other\r\nwords, they put the issue before the trier of fact on an all-or-nothing basis.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>There is evidence in the stipulated facts to demonstrate that Black did not pass-on the entire\r\namount of the bond fees to his clients.  The stipulated facts indicate that Black \"took into account\"\r\nthe bond fees in setting his rates.  The trier of fact could reasonably have concluded from this fact\r\nthat Black passed on some amount of the bond fees but not the entire amount.  Because there is\r\nsome evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably have made this deduction, the record\r\nfails to conclusively establish that appellants proved the pass-on defense as a matter of law.  <i>See\r\nSterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 691.  Appellants' second point is overruled. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>VI.  Whether Laches Should Bar Relief</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their fifth point of error appellants complain laches should apply to bar Reed from\r\nobtaining relief because she waited ten years to bring her cause of action.  Appellants have cited\r\nno authority in support of their argument.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Rule 74(f) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that briefs submitted to the courts\r\nof appeals \"shall include . . . such discussion of the facts and the authorities relied upon as may\r\nbe requisite to maintain the point at issue.\"  <span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 74(f).  Rule 74(f) has consistently\r\nbeen found to mean that an appellant presents the court of appeals with nothing to review when\r\nhe fails to cite any authority for his argument or arguments in his points of error.  <i>Hunter v. NCNB\r\nTexas Nat'l Bank</i>, 857 S.W.2d 722, 725 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist] 1993, writ denied);\r\n<i>Malouf v. Dallas Athletic Country Club</i>, 837 S.W.2d 674, 678 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, writ\r\ndism'd w.o.j.); <i>Essex Crane Rental Corp. v. Striland Constr. Co., Inc.</i>, 753 S.W.2d 751, 756\r\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 1988, writ denied).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Rule 83 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that \"[a] judgment shall not\r\nbe affirmed . . . or an appeal dismissed for defects or irregularities, in appellate procedure, either\r\nof form or substance, without allowing a reasonable time to correct or amend such defects or\r\nirregularities[.]\"  <span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 83.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The First Court of Appeals, however, has held the provisions of Rule 83 do not apply in\r\nappeals where the appellant sufficiently pleads some of his points of error but insufficiently pleads\r\nothers.  <i>Henry S. Miller Management Corp v. Houston State Associates</i>, 792 S.W.2d 128, 133-135\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, writ denied) (on rehearing).  The court reached this\r\nconclusion by reasoning that the purpose behind Rule 83 is to ensure that an appellant's brief is\r\nnot dismissed by the court of appeals solely for defective pleading.  <i>Id.</i> at 134-35.  However,\r\nwhen an appellant adequately pleads some of his points of error but not all, the appellate court,\r\nin declining to permit the appellant an opportunity to amend his defective points of error, will not\r\nbe then dismissing the whole of the appellant's brief for defective pleading.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants sufficiently pleaded all of his points of error other than the fifth by citing\r\nauthorities in support of their arguments.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Therefore, appellants have presented us nothing to\r\nreview under their fifth point of error.  The point is overruled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>VII.  Whether Reed Was Entitled to Attorney's Fees</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants argue in their sixth point of error that the trial court erred in awarding Reed\r\nattorney's fees.  They assert there is no statutory provision which authorizes the assessment of\r\nattorney's fees against them as governmental entities.  We disagree.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their brief appellants argue that Reed is not entitled to attorney's fees under either\r\nsection 37.009 or section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp;\r\nRem. Code Ann.</span> §§ 37.009, 38.001 (Vernon 1986).  Section 37.009 provides for the awarding\r\nof attorney's fees to the plaintiff if he is successful in his declaratory judgment action.  Section\r\n38.001 is the general statute establishing the circumstances under which a party is eligible to\r\nreceive attorney's fees in other types of cases.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In Reed's petition, she specifically raised two separate causes of action.  The first one she\r\nlabeled, simply enough, \"First Cause of Action,\" and the second one she labeled, \"Second Cause\r\nof Action - Declaratory Judgment.\"  Under both causes of action, however, Reed was asking the\r\ntrial court to construe the orders of the Dallas County Commissioner's Court directing the sheriff\r\nto collect the bond fees to determine whether such orders were authorized by statute.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>When a cause of action is brought under two different theories, and attorney's fees can be\r\nawarded under only one of them, the trial court should segregate the amount of time the attorney\r\nspent working on the two different theories to determine the proper amount of attorney's fees. \r\n<i>Hruska v. First State Bank of Deanville</i>, 747 S.W.2d 783, 785 (Tex. 1988); <i>First Nat'l Bank of\r\nCommerce v. Anderson Ford-Lincoln-Mercury, Inc.</i>, 704 S.W.2d 83, 85 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1985,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.) (on rehearing).  Here, Reed brought her cause of action both in tort and in a\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.  The trial court ordered $25,000 in attorney's fees, plus $5,000 more\r\non an appeal to the intermediate court of appeals, $5,000 to file a writ of error with the Supreme\r\nCourt, and $5,000 more if the writ is granted.  These figures were taken from the stipulated facts. \r\nThe trial court did not segregate the amount of attorney's fees between the tort suit and the\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.  Appellants, however, did not object to this.  The failure to so object\r\nwaived any error the trial court may have made in ordering attorney's fees for the tort suit.  <span>Tex.\r\nR. App. P.</span> 52(a); <i>Hruska</i>, 747 S.W.2d at 785.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Texas Supreme Court has recently held that attorney's fees may be assessed against\r\ngovernmental entities in cases brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act.  <i>Texas Educ. Agency\r\nv. Leeper</i>, 893 S.W.2d 432, 445-46 (Tex. 1994).  Under the facts here, because Reed under both\r\ncauses of action was requesting declaratory relief, we find that both causes of action were brought\r\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> §§ 37.001-.011\r\n(Vernon 1986 &amp; Vernon Supp. 1995); <i>Franklin v. Kyle</i>, 899 S.W.2d 405, 406 (Tex. App.—Waco\r\n1995, no writ); <i>Canales v. Zapatero</i>, 773 S.W.2d 659, 661 (Tex. App—San Antonio 1989, writ\r\ndenied) (per curiam) (on rehearing).  Therefore, we conclude the trial court did not err in\r\nassessing attorney's fees against appellants.  Their sixth point of error is overruled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>VIII.  Whether Reed Was Entitled to Prejudgment Interest on the Punitive Damages Portion\r\nof the Judgment</span></span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants in their seventh point of error argue the trial court erred in ordering\r\nprejudgment interest on the damages awarded to Reed.  The judgment awarded $23,729.02 in\r\nprejudgment interest on the actual damages against both Dallas County and Bowles, jointly and\r\nseverally.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The judgment also reveals that the trial court assessed against Bowles prejudgment\r\ninterest in the amount of $71,187.08 on the four-fold damages awarded under article 3909.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The rule in Texas has historically been that prejudgment interest is not allowable on\r\npunitive damages.  <i>Vail v. Texas Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co.</i>, 754 S.W.2d 129, 137 (Tex. 1988);\r\n<i>Cavnar v. Quality Control Parking, Inc.</i>, 696 S.W.2d 549, 555-56 (1985); <i>Gifford Hill American,\r\nInc. v. Whittington</i>, 899 S.W.2d 760, 765 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1995, n.w.h.).  The general rule\r\nwas reinforced in 1987 by section 41.006 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which\r\nprohibited the assessment of prejudgment interest on personal injury, property damage, breach of\r\nwarranty and wrongful death actions grounded in negligence or strict liability.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> §§ 33.001, 41.002(a), 41.006 (Vernon 1986 &amp; Supp. 1995); <i>C &amp; H\r\nNationwide, Inc. v. Thompson</i>, 903 S.W.2d 315, 325 (Tex. 1994); <i>Keever</i>, 888 S.W.2d at 797.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the same time the legislature enacted section 41.006, it also adopted article 5069-1.05,\r\nsection 6(a), which provides:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Judgments in wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage cases must include\r\nprejudgment interest.  Except as provided by Subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section,\r\nprejudgment interest accrues on the amount of the judgment during the period beginning\r\non the 180th day after the date the defendant receives written notice of a claim or on the\r\nday the suit is filed, whichever occurs first, and ending on the day preceding the date\r\njudgment is rendered.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann.</span> art. 5069-1.05, § 6(a) (Vernon Supp. 1995).  Section 6(a) has ushered\r\nconfusion into the area of prejudgment interest on punitive damages.  By commanding that\r\nprejudgment interest be awarded on \"judgments\" in wrongful death, personal injury, and property\r\ndamages cases, the legislature suggested that prejudgment interest should also be awarded on the\r\npunitive damage portion of the judgment because such damages are, indeed, part of the judgment. \r\n<i>See Keever</i>, 888 S.W.2d at 796.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Supreme Court, however, has held that when a cause of action falls under the\r\nprohibition against prejudgment interest under section 41.006, then section 41.006 controls over\r\nanything suggesting the contrary in section 6(a).  <i>Id.</i> at 797.  In <i>Keever</i>, the Court examined\r\nsection 41.006 and its related provisions to determine whether they precluded the assessment of\r\nprejudgment interest on punitive damages in a claim for malicious prosecution.  In part of its\r\nreasoning, the Court concluded that section 41.006 applied to intentional torts and, therefore, the\r\nawarding of prejudgment interest on the plaintiff's punitive damages was improper.  <i>Id.</i> at 798. \r\nWe, in accordance with <i>Keever</i>, conclude that the awarding of prejudgment interest on Reed's\r\nclaim on the intentional tort of extortion under article 3909 was also improper.  <i>Id.</i>; <i>but see Crum\r\n&amp; Forster, Inc. v. Monsanto Co.</i>, 887 S.W.2d 103, 154 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1994, writ dism'd\r\nby agr.) (trebling of punitive damages provisions under DTPA and article 21.21 of the Insurance\r\nCode is permissible because neither cause of action falls under section 41.006).</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Appellants'\r\nseventh point is overruled.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>IX.  Whether Appellants Were Entitled to a Set-Off</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their eighth and final point of error appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to set-off against the judgment $1,640,491 in non-contingent bail bond forfeiture judgments that Black\r\nowes to appellants.

Procedural and Factual Background</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed, the trustee in bankruptcy for Craig Black d/b/a Allied Bonding Agency, a bail\r\nbondsman, filed suit against Bowles and Dallas County challenging two different bail bond\r\nprocessing fees levied by the Dallas County Commissioner's Court, and sought four times that\r\nsum as a penalty under former article 3909,</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span> prejudgment interest, costs of court, and attorney's\r\nfees.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Bowles and Dallas County filed an equitable setoff claim in response.  Following a trial\r\nbefore the bench on stipulated facts, the trial court rendered judgment against both Bowles and\r\nDallas County.  The court denied the defendants their requested setoff relief.  Bowles and Dallas\r\nCounty were found to be jointly and severally liable for $316,387 in actual damages; $23,729.02\r\nin prejudgment interest; court costs; $25,000 in attorneys' fees for trial work; additional\r\ncompensation in the event of appeal; and postjudgment interest calculated at 10% per year. \r\nBowles was found separately liable for $949,161 in damages, plus $71,187.08 in prejudgment\r\ninterest.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On December 1, 1981, the Commissioner's Court began to charge a fee for every bail bond\r\nprocessed by the Dallas County Sheriff.

The record indicates that, during the relevant time\r\nperiods, Bowles collected from Black $471,999 in bond fees and $952 in ATGOB fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The orders for the bond fees were enacted pursuant to former article 3926(a), which\r\nprovided that a commissioner's court could set reasonable fees to be charged by sheriffs and\r\nconstables.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The ATGOB fees were neither authorized nor approved by the Commissioner's\r\nCourt.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>On May 6, 1992, the Texas Supreme Court held that a preconviction bail bond fee levied\r\nby the El Paso County Commissioner's Court (a fee similar to the one imposed by the Dallas\r\nCounty Commissioner's Court) was not authorized by any Texas statute.  <i>Camacho v. Samaniego</i>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1532268\"><a href=\"/opinion/1532268/camacho-v-samaniego/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 815 (Tex. 1992).  Specifically, the Court found article 3926a, and its successor\r\nstatute, section 118.131(a) of the Local Government Code, inapplicable to criminal law matters\r\nand held that no article of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a commissioner's court\r\nmay order the sheriff to collect a fee for the execution of a bail bond.  <i>Id.</i> at 814-15.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In accordance with <i>Camacho</i>, the trial court held the orders from the Dallas County\r\nCommissioner's Court mandating the collection of the bond fees to be unauthorized and assessed\r\nliability for the unlawfully collected fees against both Bowles and Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>II.  Whether Bowles and Dallas County are Immune</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In appellants' first point of error, they assert that both Bowles and Dallas County cannot\r\nbe subject to liability because they are entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity.  We sustain\r\nthe point with regard to Bowles but overrule it with regard to Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the outset we note that the trial court rendered judgment against Dallas County and\r\n\"Defendant Jim Bowles.\"  Thus, the court does not make it clear that Bowles is liable only in his\r\nofficial, or representative, capacity and not his individual capacity.  Such a distinction was not\r\nnecessary, however, because Reed sued Bowles solely in his official capacity.  By suing Bowles\r\nsolely in his official capacity, Reed has, in effect, made her suit solely against the governmental\r\nentity on whose behalf Bowles acted, Dallas County.  <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sharp</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">736</span></span>, 738 (Tex.

Diaz</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1497153\"><a href=\"/opinion/1497153/esparza-v-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">772</span></a></span>, 778 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1990, no writ).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The question before us, then, is whether Bowles is immune from suit in his official\r\ncapacity.  The doctrine of legislative immunity protects commissioner's courts from liability when\r\nthey act in their legislative capacity.  <i>Merrill v. Carpenter</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></span>, 68 (Tex. App.—Fort\r\nWorth 1993, writ denied).  Sheriffs share in this legislative immunity when they enforce an order\r\nissued by a commissioner's court in its legislative capacity.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  <i>Id.</i>  Moreover, this immunity applies\r\nto the sheriff in both his individual and his official capacities.  <i>See id.</i>  Here, Bowles was\r\nenforcing an order of the Dallas County Commissioner's Court issued in its legislative capacity. \r\nTherefore, Bowles shares in that same legislative immunity in his official capacity.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed contends this case differs from <i>Merrill</i> because the trial court here found the bond\r\nfees not only to be unauthorized but also to constitute a taking in violation of the Texas\r\nConstitution.  <span>Tex. Const.</span> art. I, § 17.  By raising the illegality to the constitutional level, argues\r\nReed, Bowles cannot be protected by sovereign immunity.  Article I, section 17, however, is\r\ninapplicable because the collection of the bond fees is not a taking as provided in that provision. \r\n<i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  Therefore, no constitutional violation occurred.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed also contends article 3909 waives Bowles' sovereign immunity; this argument need\r\nnot be addressed because Bowles did not extort anything as provided in article 3909.  <i>Vannerson\r\nv. Klevenhagen</i>, No. 01-93-395-CV, slip op. at 6-7 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.], September\r\n14, 1995, n.w.h.) (on rehearing); <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  Bowles, in collecting the bond fee,\r\nwas merely executing a legislative order issued by the Dallas County Commissioner's Court.  As\r\nthe Sheriff of Dallas County, he was obligated to execute the order.  While the bond fee, itself,\r\nmay have been illegal, Bowles did not unlawfully demand or receive it.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at\r\n7.  Therefore, we need not decide whether article 3909 waived Bowles' sovereign immunity\r\nbecause Bowles did not violate the provisions of article 3909 in collecting the bond fee.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed argues that state agents are not immune from liability if they act outside the scope of\r\ntheir authority.  <i>See Hale v. Colorado River Mun. Water Dist.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></span>, 539 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Austin 1991, no writ).  She contends that, because the collection of these bond fees was\r\nnot authorized by law, they constituted an unlawful taking under the constitution and, since Bowles\r\nthereby violated constitutional rights in collecting the fees, he acted outside the scope of his\r\nauthority.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Bowles, however, was acting within his authority in executing the orders of the\r\ncommissioner's court.  <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  He bore no duty to examine the\r\nconstitutionality or the legality of the statute.  <i>See Pierson v. Ray</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 555, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1213</span></a></span>, 1218 (1967); <i>Rains v. Crow</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></span>, 775 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1980, writ\r\nref'd n.r.e.)  Therefore, Bowles is protected by sovereign immunity because he did not act outside\r\nthe scope of his authority.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed further asserts that Bowles is not entitled to official or quasi-judicial immunity\r\nbecause his actions were ministerial, not discretionary.  Reed argues that only when a state agent's\r\nacts involve the exercise of discretion can he be entitled to the sovereign immunity defense.  Her\r\nargument regarding official immunity is misplaced because Bowles need not claim official\r\nimmunity.  The official immunity doctrine applies only when a state agent is sued in his individual\r\ncapacity.  Bowles was sued only in his official or representative capacity; therefore, any reliance\r\nupon an official immunity argument is inapposite.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Concerning the quasi-judicial immunity doctrine, Reed similarly argues that Bowles is not\r\nentitled to protection under it because the doctrine only protects discretionary acts while his were\r\nministerial.  <i>See Carpenter v. Barner</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2417047\"><a href=\"/opinion/2417047/carpenter-v-barner/\"><span class=\"volume\">797</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span>, 101 (Tex. App.—Waco 1990, writ denied). \r\nWe note, however, that Bowles is immune under the legislative immunity doctrine.  Consequently,\r\nwe need not address the question of whether Bowles is immune under the quasi-judicial immunity\r\ndoctrine.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Our discussion thus far on Bowles' liability for the collection of the bond fees has centered\r\nexclusively on the bond fees, not the ATGOB fees.  The ATGOB fees raise another question.  As\r\nstated above, Bowles was legislatively immune in his representative capacity from incurring any\r\nliability as a result of his collection of the bond fees.  <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 68.  He obtained this\r\nimmunity because the Commissioner's Court, acting in its legislative capacity, ordered him to\r\ncollect the fees.  <i>Id.</i>  The ATGOB fees, however, were collected by Bowles without any\r\nauthorization from the Commissioner's Court.  Accordingly, Bowles is liable for the ATGOB fees. \r\nHowever, as Bowles was sued solely in his representative capacity, he can only be liable in his\r\nrepresentative capacity.  <i>Liberty Mut.</i>, 874 S.W.2d at 738.  Appellants' first point with regard to\r\nBowles is sustained with regard to the bond, but not the ATBOB, fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Dallas County contends the trial court erred in failing to find it protected from liability\r\nunder the doctrine of sovereign immunity.  The bail bond fees ordered by the Dallas County\r\nCommissioner's Court have been characterized as a \"tax of sorts,\" and that counties are not\r\nimmune from liability for the assessment of an unauthorized tax.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at 8;\r\n<i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  The <i>Vannerson</i> and <i>Merrill</i> courts also found that this type of bond\r\nfee is necessarily paid under duress because the \"taxpayers\" were unable to conduct their bail bond\r\nbusiness without paying the fee.  <i>Vannerson</i>, slip op. at 8; <i>Merrill</i>, 867 S.W.2d at 69.  We agree\r\nwith <i>Vannerson</i> and <i>Merrill</i> that the bond fee was a tax and that it was assessed against Reed under\r\nduress.  Therefore, Dallas County is liable, and appellants' first point of error is overruled insofar\r\nas it relates to Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>III.  What, if any, Statute of Limitations Should Apply</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their fourth point of error, appellants complain the trial court erred in applying a four-year instead of a two-year statute of limitations to Reed's claims.  In addition to arguing against\r\nthe point, Reed also filed a cross-claim on the issue, alleging no statute of limitations should apply\r\nto the unlawful taking of fees by a governmental entity.  We hold that a two-year statute of\r\nlimitations should apply.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed contends this point was waived by appellants because they neglected to request any\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law from the trial court on their defense of limitations.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>August Dev. Co. v. Fish Oil Well Serv.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512099\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512099/augusta-dev-co-v-fish-oil-well-serv-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>, 542 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1988,\r\nno writ).  Appellants were not required to request any findings on the issue to preserve it for\r\nappellate review.  Appellants raised the limitations issue in an amended answer to the plaintiff's\r\npetition.  In the stipulated facts, the amount of funds collected by Bowles from Allied Bonding\r\nAgency was broken down year-by-year.  The trial court's judgment reveals that it granted Reed\r\nactual and four-fold damages for the four years preceding Allied Bonding Agency's filing of\r\nbankruptcy on October 1, 1991.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Appellants again raised the issue in their \"Motion For New Trial\r\nand to set Aside Judgment; Alternatively, to Amend, and/or Modify Judgment\" filed on January\r\n4, 1994.  The motion was denied on January 27, 1994.  From these facts, we conclude the point\r\nwas preserved by appellants.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Reed complains in her cross-point that no statute of limitations should apply to her suit\r\nagainst appellants.  She cites two cases in support of her argument, neither of which is applicable. \r\nShe contends that <i>Ratcliff v.

In\r\n<i>Nabisco</i>, the Texas Supreme Court held that laches did not bar the plaintiff's claim to recover\r\ntaxes paid under a statute later found to be unconstitutional when the statutory penalties for failure\r\nto pay the tax were unduly severe.  <i>Id.</i> at 693.  The Court held that a taxpayer could not contest\r\na tax he paid voluntarily, although he could contest one paid under duress.  <i>Id.</i>  Nabisco, in facing\r\nthe prospect of litigation, would then have been forced to make a choice between not paying the\r\ntax, which would ensure its standing to sue, or paying the tax and hoping the court would find that\r\nit was paid under duress.  <i>Id.</i>  The penalties, however, for failing to pay the tax were severe.  <i>Id.</i> \r\nThey were:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>1.

If the amount of such taxes and penalties was not paid in full on or before the next July\r\n1 following default, the corporation forfeited its right to do business in Texas.

No such statutory penalties would have been visited upon Black while he\r\ncontested the legality of the bond and ATGOB fees; therefore, <i>Nabisco</i> is also inapposite.

The Court held that\r\nit should be applied retroactively to all pending cases in which a party had preserved a complaint\r\nthat the court of appeals failed to properly scrutinize a punitive damages award.  <i>Keever</i>, 888\r\nS.W.2d at 798.  The reasoning used by the <i>Keever</i> court is the same reasoning used by the United\r\nStates Supreme Court in <i>Hyde</i> and <i>James B.

She cites <i>Swofford v.

When the defense at issue is not properly pleaded\r\nbut is brought before the trial court by the active assistance of both parties, it will be considered\r\nto have been properly raised to the trial court.  <i>Id.</i>  Here, the pass-on defense was raised in\r\nappellants' trial brief.  Moreover, facts bearing upon the pass-on defense were asserted in the\r\nstipulations filed in the trial court.  The relevant portion of the stipulations reads as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>The parties agree that the amount of Bail Bond Approval Fees and Affidavits To Go Off\r\nBail fees that Ralph C. Black, d/b/a Allied Bonding Agency was required to pay to Dallas\r\nCounty as part of his business of issuing bail bonds to criminal defendants were taken into\r\naccount by Mr. Black in setting the rates he charged his clients for his services.  However,\r\nparties are not in agreement as to the relevancy of this fact or the impact which such fact\r\nhas on the issues in this case.  Therefore, the parties have agreed to state their respective\r\npositions as follows:</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>1.  It is the Plaintiff's position that the fact that Mr. Black was either paid in\r\nadvance or reimbursed by any of the persons for whom he posted bail bond\r\napproval fees that were required of him, and collected from him by Sheriff Bowles\r\nand received by Dallas County, has absolutely no bearing on the Defendant's\r\nliability to refund any legal fees which were charged to Mr. Black due to the fact\r\nthat he had to pay the fees himself and that payment of such fees were necessary\r\nin order for Mr. Black to operate as a bail bondsman in Dallas County.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>2.  It is the Defendants' contention that the fact that Ralph Black d/b/a Allied\r\nBonding Agency was either paid in advance or was reimbursed by any persons for\r\nwhom he posted Bail Bond Approval Fees that were required of him, and collected\r\n. . . by Sheriff Bowles, and received by Dallas County, shows that Mr. Black has\r\nbeen fully paid and/or reimbursed for all monies which he posted as bail approval\r\nfees and thus sustained no economic losses as a result of posting those fees.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>Considering the stipulations and the fact that the defense was raised in appellants' trial brief, we\r\nhold the defense was tried by consent.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants contend the trial court erred in failing to consider the pass-on defense.  No\r\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law were filed by the trial court to indicate either that it rejected\r\nthe pass-on defense as a viable theory in Texas or that it accepted the theory but found the facts\r\ninsufficient to support the defense.  From the judgment, we know that the trial court did not\r\nconsider the defense meritorious because it in no way affected the amount of the damages.  We\r\nwill presume the trial court accepted the pass-on defense as a viable theory but then, sitting as the\r\ntrier of fact, failed to find that appellants had produced sufficient evidence to establish its\r\napplicability.  <i>See Burnett v. Motyka</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2434946\"><a href=\"/opinion/2434946/burnett-v-motyka/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span>, 736 (Tex. 1980) (per curiam) (\"In a\r\nnonjury trial, where no findings of fact or conclusions of law are filed or requested, it will be\r\nimplied that the trial court made all the necessary findings to support its judgment.\")  We will,\r\ntherefore, examine the trial court's ruling to determine whether appellants proved their defense\r\nat trial as a matter of law.  <i>See Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2451326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2451326/sterner-v-marathon-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span>, 690 (Tex. 1989).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>A party attempting to overcome an adverse fact finding in which he has the burden of proof\r\nas a matter of law must, first, examine the record for evidence that supports the fact finder's\r\nfindings while ignoring all evidence to the contrary, and, second, if there is no evidence to support\r\nthe fact finder's answer, then the entire record must be examined to see if the contrary position\r\nis established as a matter of law.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Under the pass-on defense, appellants bore the burden of establishing which portion of the\r\nillegally assessed fee was passed on to Black's customers.  <i>See Abbott Lab.</i>, 38 Tex. Sup. Ct. J.\r\nat 964 n.4.  The above-quoted stipulation of facts reveals that appellants did not attempt to\r\napportion the amount of funds Black allegedly passed on to his clients.  Instead, they attempted\r\nto demonstrate that Black passed on to his clients the entire amount of the bond fees.  In other\r\nwords, they put the issue before the trier of fact on an all-or-nothing basis.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>There is evidence in the stipulated facts to demonstrate that Black did not pass-on the entire\r\namount of the bond fees to his clients.  The stipulated facts indicate that Black \"took into account\"\r\nthe bond fees in setting his rates.  The trier of fact could reasonably have concluded from this fact\r\nthat Black passed on some amount of the bond fees but not the entire amount.  Because there is\r\nsome evidence from which the trier of fact could reasonably have made this deduction, the record\r\nfails to conclusively establish that appellants proved the pass-on defense as a matter of law.  <i>See\r\nSterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 691.  Appellants' second point is overruled. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>VI.  Whether Laches Should Bar Relief</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their fifth point of error appellants complain laches should apply to bar Reed from\r\nobtaining relief because she waited ten years to bring her cause of action.  Appellants have cited\r\nno authority in support of their argument.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Rule 74(f) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that briefs submitted to the courts\r\nof appeals \"shall include . . . such discussion of the facts and the authorities relied upon as may\r\nbe requisite to maintain the point at issue.\"  <span>Tex.

The court reached this\r\nconclusion by reasoning that the purpose behind Rule 83 is to ensure that an appellant's brief is\r\nnot dismissed by the court of appeals solely for defective pleading.  <i>Id.</i> at 134-35.  However,\r\nwhen an appellant adequately pleads some of his points of error but not all, the appellate court,\r\nin declining to permit the appellant an opportunity to amend his defective points of error, will not\r\nbe then dismissing the whole of the appellant's brief for defective pleading.  <i>Id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants sufficiently pleaded all of his points of error other than the fifth by citing\r\nauthorities in support of their arguments.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Therefore, appellants have presented us nothing to\r\nreview under their fifth point of error.

Section 37.009 provides for the awarding\r\nof attorney's fees to the plaintiff if he is successful in his declaratory judgment action.

The first one she\r\nlabeled, simply enough, \"First Cause of Action,\" and the second one she labeled, \"Second Cause\r\nof Action - Declaratory Judgment.\"  Under both causes of action, however, Reed was asking the\r\ntrial court to construe the orders of the Dallas County Commissioner's Court directing the sheriff\r\nto collect the bond fees to determine whether such orders were authorized by statute.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>When a cause of action is brought under two different theories, and attorney's fees can be\r\nawarded under only one of them, the trial court should segregate the amount of time the attorney\r\nspent working on the two different theories to determine the proper amount of attorney's fees. \r\n<i>Hruska v.

App.—Dallas 1985,\r\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.) (on rehearing).  Here, Reed brought her cause of action both in tort and in a\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.  The trial court ordered $25,000 in attorney's fees, plus $5,000 more\r\non an appeal to the intermediate court of appeals, $5,000 to file a writ of error with the Supreme\r\nCourt, and $5,000 more if the writ is granted.  These figures were taken from the stipulated facts. \r\nThe trial court did not segregate the amount of attorney's fees between the tort suit and the\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.  Appellants, however, did not object to this.  The failure to so object\r\nwaived any error the trial court may have made in ordering attorney's fees for the tort suit.  <span>Tex.\r\nR. App. P.</span> 52(a); <i>Hruska</i>, 747 S.W.2d at 785.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Texas Supreme Court has recently held that attorney's fees may be assessed against\r\ngovernmental entities in cases brought under the Declaratory Judgments Act.  <i>Texas Educ.

Under the facts here, because Reed under both\r\ncauses of action was requesting declaratory relief, we find that both causes of action were brought\r\nunder the Declaratory Judgments Act.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> §§ 37.001-.011\r\n(Vernon 1986 &amp; Vernon Supp. 1995); <i>Franklin v.

Whether Reed Was Entitled to Prejudgment Interest on the Punitive Damages Portion\r\nof the Judgment</span></span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>Appellants in their seventh point of error argue the trial court erred in ordering\r\nprejudgment interest on the damages awarded to Reed.  The judgment awarded $23,729.02 in\r\nprejudgment interest on the actual damages against both Dallas County and Bowles, jointly and\r\nseverally.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The judgment also reveals that the trial court assessed against Bowles prejudgment\r\ninterest in the amount of $71,187.08 on the four-fold damages awarded under article 3909.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The rule in Texas has historically been that prejudgment interest is not allowable on\r\npunitive damages.  <i>Vail v.

The general rule\r\nwas reinforced in 1987 by section 41.006 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, which\r\nprohibited the assessment of prejudgment interest on personal injury, property damage, breach of\r\nwarranty and wrongful death actions grounded in negligence or strict liability.  <span>Tex. Civ. Prac.\r\n&amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> §§ 33.001, 41.002(a), 41.006 (Vernon 1986 &amp; Supp. 1995); <i>C &amp; H\r\nNationwide, Inc. v. Thompson</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372172\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372172/c-h-nationwide-inc-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span>, 325 (Tex. 1994); <i>Keever</i>, 888 S.W.2d at 797.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>At the same time the legislature enacted section 41.006, it also adopted article 5069-1.05,\r\nsection 6(a), which provides:</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Judgments in wrongful death, personal injury, and property damage cases must include\r\nprejudgment interest.  Except as provided by Subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section,\r\nprejudgment interest accrues on the amount of the judgment during the period beginning\r\non the 180th day after the date the defendant receives written notice of a claim or on the\r\nday the suit is filed, whichever occurs first, and ending on the day preceding the date\r\njudgment is rendered.</span></span></p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann.</span> art. 5069-1.05, § 6(a) (Vernon Supp. 1995).  Section 6(a) has ushered\r\nconfusion into the area of prejudgment interest on punitive damages.  By commanding that\r\nprejudgment interest be awarded on \"judgments\" in wrongful death, personal injury, and property\r\ndamages cases, the legislature suggested that prejudgment interest should also be awarded on the\r\npunitive damage portion of the judgment because such damages are, indeed, part of the judgment. \r\n<i>See Keever</i>, 888 S.W.2d at 796.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>The Supreme Court, however, has held that when a cause of action falls under the\r\nprohibition against prejudgment interest under section 41.006, then section 41.006 controls over\r\nanything suggesting the contrary in section 6(a).  <i>Id.</i> at 797.  In <i>Keever</i>, the Court examined\r\nsection 41.006 and its related provisions to determine whether they precluded the assessment of\r\nprejudgment interest on punitive damages in a claim for malicious prosecution.  In part of its\r\nreasoning, the Court concluded that section 41.006 applied to intentional torts and, therefore, the\r\nawarding of prejudgment interest on the plaintiff's punitive damages was improper.  <i>Id.</i> at 798. \r\nWe, in accordance with <i>Keever</i>, conclude that the awarding of prejudgment interest on Reed's\r\nclaim on the intentional tort of extortion under article 3909 was also improper.  <i>Id.</i>; <i>but see Crum\r\n&amp; Forster, Inc. v. Monsanto Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></span>, 154 (Tex.

Whether Appellants Were Entitled to a Set-Off</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>In their eighth and final point of error appellants argue the trial court erred in failing to set-off against the judgment $1,640,491 in non-contingent bail bond forfeiture judgments that Black\r\nowes to appellants.  Appellants, however, also state in their argument that they raise the point\r\nsolely to preserve the error should it be brought before the United States Bankruptcy Court.  They\r\ndo not request any particular relief from this court.  We cannot grant any relief that is not\r\nspecifically requested of this court.  <span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 74(g).
