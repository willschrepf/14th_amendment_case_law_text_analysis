(Western District of Oklahoma)\n CENTRAL OKLAHOMA                                (D.C. No.5:05-CV-01288-W)\n AMERICAN INDIAN HEALTH\n COUNCIL, INC., d/b/a THE\n OKLAHOMA CITY INDIAN CLINIC,\n\n              Appellee/Defendant.\n\n\n                           ORDER AND JUDGMENT *\n\n\nBefore KELLY, BRISCOE and McCONNELL, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n      Renee Nettle, a former employee of the Oklahoma City Indian Clinic (“the\n\nClinic”), alleges that she was repeatedly harassed at work and fired when she\n\ncomplained about it. She filed a civil rights suit against the Clinic. The Clinic\n\nwas granted summary judgment on all claims. Ms. Nettle appeals, and we affirm\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n      *\n       This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                     I. Facts\n\n      Ms. Nettle is a one-half Caucasian and one-half Native American, a\n\nmember of the Delaware/Caddo Tribes. She is light-skinned and sometimes\n\nmistaken for a Caucasian. Ms. Nettle testified that she was “[b]y far” the person\n\nwith the “lightest skin color” in the family services, R. 238, and that “most people\n\nto look at me they don’t see me as Indian, identifiably Indian.” R. 243. Ms.\n\nNettle worked for the Oklahoma City Indian Clinic (“the Clinic”), whose\n\n“primary function is to provide medical and other health-related services to\n\nNative Americans.” R. 11. The Clinic is part of the Indian Health Service (IHS),\n\nwhich is permitted by law to give a hiring preference for Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the Indian Health Service website:\n\n      The purpose of this hiring preference is to support Indian participation in\n      self-government, to further the Government’s trust obligations to tribes, to\n      encourage American Indians and Alaska Natives to pursue higher\n      education, and to enhance the positive effect of having Indians administer\n      matters that affect Indian tribal life. The preference is granted to Indians\n      not as a racial group but as members of sovereign tribal entities. The\n      legislative history of Indian Preference hiring law reflects Congress’\n      awareness that non-Indians would be at an employment disadvantage in the\n      IHS and the BIA.\n\nhttp://info.ihs.gov/Infrastructure/Infrastructure7.pdf. Ms. Nettle worked for about\n\neleven years (August 13, 1993 to December 31, 2003) as a Child Development\n\nSpecialist in the Clinic’s Community Services Department. Dist. Ct. Op. 1. From\n\nJanuary 1, 2004, until her termination in November of that year, her job title was\n\nNative American Youth Specialist. R. 11. As a Child Development Specialist,\n\n                                        -2-\n\fMs. Nettle’s duties included working with and counseling Native American\n\nfamilies and their children, although she was never licensed as a counselor. Dist.\n\nCt. Op. 2. As Native American Youth Specialist, Ms. Nettle’s job was to\n\n“provide Health Promotion/Disease Prevention services directed towards\n\nAmerican Indian youth” and she was responsible for “mental health, substance\n\nabuse and social work service issues[.]” Dist. Ct. Op. 2. During her time at the\n\nClinic, Ms. Nettle received positive job evaluations, and was never subject to any\n\ndisciplinary action. R. 12; R. 112–16. She had been called a “wonderful asset”\n\nto the Clinic. Dist. Ct. Op. 3.\n\n      The Chief Executive Officer at the Clinic was Terry Hunter, who is part\n\nCaucasian and part Native American, with tribal membership in the Kiowa Tribe\n\nand with tribal affiliation in the Delaware Nation and the Caddo Tribe. Aple. Br.\n\n6. His skin pigmentation is darker than Ms. Nettle’s. R. 12, 83, 163, 237–38. In\n\nher complaint before the district court, Ms. Nettle said that Mr. Hunter would\n\nmake “frequent comments in the workplace about different Native American\n\ntribes whose skin colors were lighter or darker than other Native American\n\ntribes,” and suggested that some employees were too “white.” R. 26. Mr. Hunter\n\nalso, according to Ms. Nettle, said of her that “she thinks she’s Indian, but we\n\nwonder” and “on other occasions” made “derogatory statements about the\n\nDelaware tribe . . . [such as] that ‘they want to pretend and be like Indians of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbrowner skin.’” R. 12; R. 154. Although she knew that some of the comments\n\nmight have been in jest, she still found many of them offensive. R. 171.\n\n       Ms. Nettle also accused Robyn Sunday, the Clinic’s Chief Operating\n\nOfficer, of making derisive comments about Ms. Nettle and her appearance,\n\nsaying at one point that she wanted to fire “white Renee.” R. 13. And she asserts\n\nthat patients in the Clinic would call her the “white doctor.” Aplt. Br. 37.\n\n       In addition to the comments directed at her, Ms. Nettle alleges that the\n\nClinic “removed several activities for which [she] was responsible and gave them\n\nto other employees.” R. 168. The reason for this, she alleges, was because Mr.\n\nHunter believed that her light skin and Caucasian appearance rendered her a poor\n\nrepresentative for the Clinic in the Native American community. Aplt. Br. 5.\n\n       Ms. Nettle eventually filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on October 22, 2004. She\n\nchecked off the boxes on the form indicating that she was claiming discrimination\n\nbased on race, color, and age. The text of the charge read that “Mr. Hunter would\n\nmake comments about different tribes, and about those whose skin is lighter or\n\ndarker than others. I and other employees are treated differently because of our\n\ntribe or skin color.” R. 390. The document put March 10, 2004 as the earliest\n\ndate discrimination took place and October 20 as the latest. Id. In March 2004,\n\nthe Clinic had canceled youth activities of which Ms. Nettle was in charge. R.\n\n163.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      On November 1, Ms. Nettle was placed on “administrative leave pending an\n\ninvestigation” into two matters: a memo Ms. Nettle had written on October 27\n\ndenying responsibility for a break-in at the Clinic offices, and whether Ms. Nettle\n\nhad counseled a patient after being directed not to. Dist. Ct. Op. 7. Despite\n\nhaving been placed on administrative leave, Ms. Nettle used a Clinic van that\n\nsame day to deliver materials for a Clinic function. Id. Ms. Nettle testified that\n\nshe had been instructed by her supervisor to go ahead and transport the materials.\n\nAplt. Br. 9; R. 101.\n\n      In a letter dated November 1, 2004, Ms. Nettle was informed that she had\n\nbeen fired, effective November 1, 2004, for “misconduct,” including her\n\ncontinuation of “counseling patients after being given a directive to cease all\n\nindividual counseling.” Dist. Ct. Op. 8. Ms. Nettle filed a second EEOC charge\n\nalleging that she had been terminated in retaliation for filing her first EEOC\n\nCharge. R. 14. The Notice of Discrimination the Clinic received for Ms. Nettle’s\n\nfirst charge was dated November 5, 2004, four days after the Clinic fired Ms.\n\nNettle, suggesting that the termination could not have been in retaliation for the\n\ncharge. Dist Ct. Op. 9. Ms. Nettle, however, testified that she had filed her\n\ncharge on October 22 and that an employee with the EEOC told her she would\n\nfaxing her Charge to the Clinic “immediately” and “that day.” R. 274, 285.\n\n      Ms. Nettle filed suit against the Clinic in federal district court on\n\nNovember 4, 2005. R. 2. In her original complaint, she alleged race and color\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdiscrimination, claiming that the comments of Mr. Hunter and others created a\n\nhostile work environment. She also alleged that she was fired in retaliation for\n\nfiling her first EEOC charge. R. 29, 30. Ms. Nettle did not plead age\n\ndiscrimination in her original complaint, although she had checked off the box in\n\nher EEOC Charge, and she eventually conceded it. R. 56, 191. She also later\n\nconceded her claim for race discrimination. R. 191, 394. But in her reply to the\n\nClinic’s motion for summary judgment, Ms. Nettle asked the court to allow her to\n\nmaintain a cause of action for discrimination based on national origin. R. 191.\n\n      The district court granted the Clinic’s motion for summary judgment. The\n\ndistrict court held that (1) under the “totality of the circumstances,” no reasonable\n\njuror could find that the comments that were directed at Ms. Nettle created a\n\nhostile work environment, (2) Ms. Nettle did not make a prima facie showing that\n\nshe had been treated adversely because of her skin color, and (3) there was no\n\ncausal connection between Ms. Nettle’s filing her first EEOC charge and the\n\nClinic’s decision to fire her, hence no retaliatory termination. Dist. Ct. Op. 15,\n\n18, 21. The district court also held that her national origin claim was not\n\nadministratively exhausted, because she did not “identify national origin as a\n\nbasis for discrimination in her EEOC Charges of Discrimination.” Id. at 24.\n\n      Ms. Nettle appeals. We review the district court’s decision de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standard used by the district court, McKenzie v. Dovala,\n\n242 F.3d 967, 969 (10th Cir. 2001). Summary judgment is appropriate only if\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law. Id. “When applying this standard, we view the\n\nevidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party,” and the nonmovant is given “wide berth to prove a factual\n\ncontroversy exists.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n                            II. Retaliatory Discharge\n\n      Ms. Nettle argues that the court erred in finding that she had not made a\n\nprima facie showing of retaliatory discharge. In her second filed EEOC Charge,\n\nMs. Nettle said that she believed that she had been retaliated against “for\n\ncomplaining of protected activity in my . . . charge still pending before the\n\nCommission.” R. 33. To prove a prima facie case for retaliation, Ms. Nettle must\n\nshow that she engaged in protected activity, that the Clinic took a material\n\n“adverse action” against her, and that there was a causal connection between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action. See Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., 497\n\nF.3d 1160, 1176 (10th Cir. 2007). The district court noted that it was\n\n“undisputed” that filing an EEOC charge is protected activity, against which the\n\nClinic could not have retaliated by firing Ms. Nettle. Dist. Ct. Op. 19. This\n\nleaves Ms. Nettle’s burden to show that there was a causal connection between\n\nthe filing of the EEOC charge (the protected activity) and her termination (the\n\nadverse action).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      The Clinic objected that Ms. Nettle could not show a causal connection,\n\nand the district court agreed. Ms. Nettle filed her first Charge of Discrimination\n\non October 22, 2004, and the Clinic fired her on November 1 of that same year.\n\nA causal connection between an employee’s protected activity and an employer’s\n\nadverse action “may be demonstrated by evidence of circumstances that justify an\n\ninference of retaliatory motive,” such as when the protected conduct is “closely\n\nfollowed” by an adverse action. Burrus v. United Telephone Co. of Kan., Inc.,\n\n683 F.2d 339, 343 (10th Cir. 1982). But the Clinic maintains that it was not\n\naware that Ms. Nettle had filed her Charge with the EEOC until November 4, so\n\nthat it could not have fired her because of the charge, even if it fired her after she\n\nfiled the charge. See Jones v. U.P.S., Inc., 502 F.3d 1176, 1195 (10th Cir. 2007)\n\n(“Unless an employer knows that an employee is engaging in protected activity, it\n\ncannot retaliate against that employee because of the protected conduct . . . .”),\n\nWilliams v. Rice, 983 F.2d 177, 181 (10th Cir.1993) (“to establish a ‘causal\n\nconnection,’ plaintiff must show that the individual who took adverse action\n\nagainst him knew of the employee’s protected activity”).\n\n      Ms. Nettle testified in her deposition that the person who “took her\n\ninformation” at the EEOC, Carrie Hill, indicated that she was going to fax her\n\ncharge to the Clinic “that day” and “follow[] up by mail.” R. 284–85. Although\n\nMs. Nettle conceded in her deposition that she had no first-hand knowledge that\n\nthe Clinic received her charge prior to her termination, she says she called Ms.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fHill later in the day of October 22 and Ms. Hill told her “she had faxed it,”\n\nmeaning the charge. R. 285; Aplt. Br. 24–25.\n\n      This is not enough to create a genuine dispute of fact. A court on summary\n\njudgment can accept evidence only when it would be admissible if offered in\n\ncourt. Adams v. Am. Guar. & Liab. Ins. Co., 233 F.3d 1242, 1246 (10th Cir.\n\n2000) (“Hearsay testimony that would be inadmissible at trial cannot be used to\n\ndefeat a motion for summary judgment[.]”). Ms. Nettle’s testimony that Ms. Hill\n\ntold her that she (Hill) had faxed the charge on October 22 is inadmissible\n\nhearsay. Ms. Nettle could have obtained testimony from Ms. Hill directly, but did\n\nnot. Accordingly, there is no admissible evidence in the record showing that the\n\nClinic received the charge prior to Ms. Nettle’s termination on November 1.\n\n      Alternatively, Ms. Nettle argues that the “protected activity” that caused\n\nher firing was more than simply her filing of an EEOC charge. Appellant’s Br.\n\n15. The district court held that Ms. Nettle’s retaliation charge “did not complain\n\nthat she was retaliated against because she voiced informal complaints to\n\nsuperiors or co-workers, because she disagreed with her placement on\n\nadministrative leave or because she believed her placement on administrative\n\nleave was discriminatory.” Dist. Ct. Op. 19 n.14. Ms. Nettle contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred by reading her retaliation charge this “narrowly,” and that the\n\nprotected activity for which she suffered retaliation included earlier internal\n\ncomplaints to her superiors and co-workers.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Ms. Nettle is correct that “informal complaints” can be considered as\n\nprotected activity. E.E.O.C. v. PVNF, L.L.C., 487 F.3d 790, 804 (10th Cir. 2007)\n\n(prohibition against retaliation “protects conduct short of filing a formal charge”).\n\nThe issue before us is whether her second charge included a claim of this sort of\n\nprotected activity.\n\n      The relevant part of Ms. Nettle’s second charge read that she believed she\n\nhad been retaliated against “for complaining of protected activity in my above-\n\nmentioned charge.” R. 33. There is some garbled syntax here. (Why would she\n\nbe retaliated against for complaining of protected activity?) But the meaning of\n\nthe charge seems straightforward: Ms. Nettle charged that she had been\n\nterminated because she complained about discrimination in “the above-mentioned\n\ncharge,” which was her first Charge of Discrimination before the EEOC.\n\nMoreover, the “particulars” of the charge support this straightforward reading. In\n\nher second charge, Ms. Nettle recites that she filed her first charge of\n\ndiscrimination on October 22 and was fired on November 1. She then identifies\n\nwho notified her of her termination and then concludes with the statement in\n\nquestion (“I believe I have been retaliated against . . .”), with no mention of any\n\nother protected activity. Further evidence in support of the district court’s\n\ninterpretation: Ms. Nettle entitled the second cause of action in her complaint\n\n“retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination.” R. 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      We agree with Ms. Nettle that we must read her charge liberally. Kells v.\n\nSinclair Buick-GMC Truck, Inc., 210 F.3d 827, 836 (8th Cir. 2000); Brown v.\n\nHartshorn Pub. Sch. Dist. No. 1, 864 F.2d 680, 682 (10th Cir. 1988). But we\n\ncannot read her charge to include conduct she did not mention. While we can\n\ngive her words a liberal construction, filling in gaps and reading vague terms\n\nexpansively, we are not entitled to invent “ex nihilo, a claim which simply was\n\nnot made.” Kells, 210 F.3d at 836. The investigation called for by the language\n\nof the charge is obvious and limited: to see whether she had been retaliated\n\nagainst for filing her first charge of discrimination. Such claims are familiar in\n\nretaliation cases. See, e.g., Denetclaw v. Thoutt Bros. Concrete Contractors, Inc.,\n\n287 Fed. App’x 17, 20 (10th Cir. 2008) (charge read “I believe that I have been\n\nterminated in retaliation for filing a Charge of Discrimination”); Ross v. Porter,\n\n119 Fed. App’x. 209, 210 (10th Cir. 2004) (“Ross alleged . . . retaliation for filing\n\na charge of discrimination”). If Ms. Nettle believed that she was retaliated\n\nagainst for other activity, in addition to her filing of the EEOC charge, she could\n\nhave filed a new charge. See Annett v. Univ. of Kan., 371 F.3d 1233, 1238 (10th\n\nCir. 2004) (holding that each discrete retaliatory action constitutes its own\n\n“unlawful employment practice for which administrative remedies must be\n\nexhausted” (citation omitted)).\n\n      Moreover, even if Ms. Nettle’s EEOC charge could be interpreted as\n\nexpansively as she now asks, her complaint in district court was expressly limited\n\n                                        -11-\n\fto “retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination.” R. 30. Whatever may be the\n\nreasons for liberal construction of an uncounseled EEOC charge, it is well\n\nestablished that claims not made in district court are waived. United States v.\n\nRogers, 556 F.3d 1130, 1136 (10th Cir. 2009). Accordingly, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court in granting summary judgment to the Clinic on her retaliation claim.\n\n                     III. Discrimination on the Basis of Color\n\n      A. Hostile Work Environment\n\n      Title VII of the Civil Rights Act proscribes employment practices that\n\n“permeate the workplace with ‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult\n\nthat is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s\n\nemployment and create an abusive working environment.’” Tademy v. Union\n\nPacific Corp., 520 F.3d 1149, 1156 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted). “Conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an\n\nobjectively hostile or abusive work environment—an environment that a\n\nreasonable person would find hostile or abusive—is beyond Title VII’s purview.”\n\nHarris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). The district court held that\n\n“some of the comments and remarks”of her co-workers and supervisors could\n\nhave caused Ms. Nettle subjectively to perceive that her working environment\n\nwas hostile and abusive. Dist. Ct. Op. 13–14. But it also held that “from the\n\nobjective standpoint,” the “harassment or offensive conduct over the thirteen-year\n\nemployment period was not sufficiently constant or frequent . . . that it could be\n\n                                         -12-\n\fconsidered sufficiently pervasive or severe to survive summary judgment.” Id. at\n\n15.\n\n      The district court highlighted three deficiencies it saw in Ms. Nettle’s case.\n\nFirst, it noted that, although Ms. Nettle had “named many individuals who she . . .\n\ncontended harassed her. . . . [she] has not attributed offensive remarks to many of\n\nthese alleged harassers, and she has not described the exact nature of many of the\n\ncomments.” Dist. Ct. Op. 14. Second, it noted that Ms. Nettle “had admitted\n\nthat she cannot recall with any specificity the dates when many . . . comments\n\nwere made.” Id. Finally, although Ms. Nettle claimed to have been subjected to\n\ndiscrimination throughout her employment, “she has conceded that ‘[19]96 . . .\n\nuntil [19]99 were good years” and that she did not recall that Mr. Hunter directed\n\nany offensive comments at her during that time, except in jest. Id. at 15; see R.\n\n242–43 (describing that in those years Mr. Hunter would “speak with [her]. .\n\n[and] promote any activities that [she] initiated or attempted to initiate or present;\n\nany requisition or anything [she] requested in regard to [her] youth groups wasn’t\n\ndenied.”).\n\n      Ms. Nettle asks us to reverse the district court’s holding. Her brief points\n\nto several pages in the record which summarize “the instances of discrimination\n\nbecause of her skin color” that Ms. Nettle alleges she has suffered. Aplt. Br. at\n\n27. These stated instances suffer from many of the problems that the district\n\ncourt identified in its opinion. Dates are left unspecified. Ms. Nettle admitted\n\n                                         -13-\n\fagain and again that she could not recall the dates or events at which Mr. Hunter\n\nallegedly made the discriminatory comments. R. 167, 88–89. She also identified\n\nother people as making discriminatory remarks, but likewise could not give\n\nspecific dates or events at which they were made. R. 90–91, 93, 95. Many of her\n\nallegations against Mr. Hunter are vague. In her deposition, she said that “[i]n\n\n1993 in all staff meetings,” there would always be “at least one discriminatory or\n\nracial slur against different tribal affiliations or lighter-skinned people,” and from\n\n“1993 to [her] termination date there were statements of discrimination by Mr.\n\nHunter.” R. 88–89. In short, “[e]verything in a negative nature” came from Mr.\n\nHunter. R. 250.\n\n      Some of this vagueness is inconsequential. A hostile work environment\n\nclaimant need not establish precise dates for every insult. After all, the point of\n\nsuch claims is that the discrimination was ongoing and pervasive, that is, all the\n\ntime, and not at isolated points in time. See, e.g., Rocha Vigil v. City of Las\n\nCruces, 119 F.3d 871, 875 (10th Cir. 1997). Moreover, Ms. Nettle does recall\n\nsome specific remarks by Mr. Hunter and others. She testified that Mr. Hunter\n\ncommented that Ms. Nettle “thinks she’s Indian, but we wonder. We have been\n\ntrying to get rid of her since the day we hired her.” R. 167–68. Mr. Hunter also\n\nsaid, according to Ms. Nettle, that people who did not look Indian “don’t\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\frepresent the Indian community well.” 1 R. 246. In addition, she points to\n\nspecific remarks by other clinic members, for example, Daren Paddyaker’s remark\n\nthat Ms. Nettle was a “wannabe Indian,” and Dawn Singleton’s comment that she\n\nwas the “white counselor.” R. 224, 232. Affidavits from other employees allege\n\nthat Robyn Sunday, the Chief Operating Officer of the clinic, referred to Ms.\n\nNettle as “the big-boobed white Renee” on several occasions. R. 366, 369.\n\nMoreover, affidavits from two employees allege that those who did not appear\n\n“Indian” were treated differently at the Clinic. R. 359, 365. Finally, she alleged\n\nthat child patients at the Clinic, and their parents, would sometimes refer to her as\n\n“white doctor.” R. 237.\n\n      A hostile work environment is one that is “permeated with discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter\n\nthe conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” MacKenzie v. City & County of Denver, 414 F.3d 1266, 1280\n\n(10th Cir. 2005). It is not the function of Title VII to make a federal case out of\n\nevery insulting or unpleasant remark, even those related to protected status.\n\n“[M]ere utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feelings in a\n\nemployee . . . does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to\n\n\n      1\n       It appears that Ms. Nettle heard this remark second hand from the human\nresources director. R. 246. In fact, the only specific remark from Mr. Hunter Ms.\nNettle appears to have alleged was the “she claims she’s Indian, but we wonder”\nline. See R. 397–98.\n\n                                          -15-\n\fimplicate Title VII.” Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (quotations and\n\ninternal citation omitted). Rather, a hostile work environment is one that a\n\n“reasonable person would find hostile or abusive.” Id. This generally entails a\n\n“steady barrage of opprobrious [] comments.” Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 474\n\nF.3d 675, 680 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Chavez v. New Mexico, 397 F.3d 826,\n\n832 (10th Cir. 2005); Ford v. West, 222 F.3d 767, 777 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting\n\nBolden v. PRC Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994)). 2\n\n      We do not believe that the district court erred in finding that Ms. Nettle’s\n\nallegation of discrimination does not meet this standard. Ms. Nettle’s allegations\n\nof identifiable discriminatory or harassing conduct constitute “sporadic . . . slurs”\n\nrather than a “steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments.” Bolden v. PRC Inc.,\n\n43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994). We also note, as did the district court, that\n\nMs. Nettle was employed by the Clinic for over a decade, and that she conceded\n\nthat she was treated favorably for a significant portion of that time, from 1996 to\n\n“around 1999.” R. 242; see Dist. Ct. Op. 14–15.\n\n      Ms. Nettle’s claims that Mr. Hunter would make “frequent” racial\n\ncomments at staff meetings and was generally “negative,” as well as the\n\nstatements by her co-workers that there was discrimination at the clinic, do not\n\n\n      2\n        The dissent complains that these precedents have “improperly converted a\ndisjunctive analysis,” ‘severe or pervasive,’ into a conjunctive analysis, requiring\n“severe and pervasive.’” Diss. Op. 10 n.4. But that is the governing law in this\ncircuit, and Appellant has not asked us to revisit it.\n\n                                         -16-\n\frise to the level of creating a genuine dispute. Ms. Nettle’s claim that from “1993\n\nto [her] termination date there were statements of discrimination by Mr. Hunter,”\n\nR. 89, is overly vague both as to pervasiveness and as to severity. See Adler v.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 144 F.3d 664, 674 (10th Cir. 1998) (“Vague, conclusory\n\nstatements do not suffice to create a genuine issue of material fact.”); see also\n\nQuevado v. Trans-Pacific Shipping, Inc., 143 F.3d 1255, 1257 (9th Cir. 1988)\n\n(noting that Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) provides that party opposing summary judgment\n\nmust “set forth specific facts that show there is a genuine issue for trial.”). Ms.\n\nNettle testified that at “every staff meeting” in 1993—a decade before she lodged\n\nher complaint with the EEOC—Mr. Hunter made “at least one” racial slur, R. 88,\n\nbut after that she offers no evidence regarding the frequency of his offensive\n\nremarks, other than to say that “‘96 to around 1999 were favorable years for me\n\nin regard to the treatment.” R. 242. Nor does she supply much detail about the\n\ncontent of his comments. It is not even clear that most of Mr. Hunter’s comments\n\nwere directed at her, or at persons of her ethnicity. She describes comments he\n\nmade about Comanches, Cheyennes, and Cherokees, but those are not her tribes. 3\n\nAlthough there is some confusion about this in the record, Ms. Nettle understood\n\nthat Mr. Hunter’s ethnic makeup was similar to her own: both being half\n\n      3\n        Ms. Nettle testified that Mr. Hunter “had said things about the Cherokees,\nsomething about a room full of Cherokees makes like a full blood or something\nlike that. And then he, you know, joked in there because I was there and I think\nhe added the Delaware Tribe in on it.” R. 241-42. From her testimony, it does\nnot appear that Mr. Hunter bore any particular animus against Ms. Nettle’s tribe.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fCaucasian, and both affiliated with the Delaware Nation and the Caddo. It cannot\n\nbe assumed that all of his “comments about different tribes, and about those\n\nwhose skin is lighter or darker than others,” R. 390, related to her.\n\n      Nor do any of the particular comments recalled by Ms. Nettle strike us as\n\nsufficiently severe or opprobrious (considered objectively) that a reasonable jury\n\nwould regard them “alter[ing] the conditions of the victim’s employment and\n\ncreat[ing] an abusive working environment.” MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1280.\n\nCertainly none of the comments directed at (or around) Ms. Nettle rose to the\n\nlevel of being physically threatening or humiliating. Chavez v. New Mexico, 397\n\nF.3d 826, 832 (10th Cir. 2005) (in determining hostile work environment, factors\n\nto be considered include whether the discriminatory conduct is “physically\n\nthreatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance”). Many of the\n\nstatements she complains about simply identify her as “white” or as not really an\n\nIndian. 4 Ms. Nettle testified that she “heard once” that Mr. Hunter said that the\n\nDelaware Tribe “was the tribal wannabes.” R. 241. We can easily understand\n\nthat it could be annoying and irritating for a person of one racial mix to be\n\nmistaken for another, but there is no precedent for regarding a mistaken racial\n\nidentifier—not employing any epithetical terminology—as opprobrious or\n\nabusive.\n\n      4\n      The dissent focuses on Robyn Sunday’s alleged description of her as “the\nbig-boobed white Renee.” R. 366, 369. But the sting in the comment is its\nsexism, and Ms. Nettle has not complained of sex discrimination.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f      Moreover, as Ms. Nettle concedes, many of the comments were made\n\njokingly. See, e.g., R. 219 (board president “making jest of Cherokees”) 5; id. at\n\n220–21 (Dawn Singleton would “joke” about not going anywhere because she was\n\nnot Indian and had blonde hair and green eyes); id. at 224 (Tracy Mailo would\n\nmake “statements in jest at meetings regarding my skin color”); id. at 226\n\n(explaining that she would interpret comments made “in jest . . . to be in light or\n\nnot wanting to offend as much as in regard to statements being made that are\n\nintended to be disparaging in nature” and stating that “many” of Mr. Hunter’s\n\ncomments “were intended to be in jest”); id. at 229 (offering that she no longer\n\nfound a staff member’s comments offensive because as “the years wore on . . . I\n\nknew she didn’t mean [them] disparagingly”); id. at 241 (“[m]ost times” Mr.\n\nHunter said something about a tribe it was “in jest.”). Where comments are made\n\nin jest and the plaintiff recognizes them as such, unless they are of unusual\n\npervasiveness or severity, they cannot ordinarily be regarded as having “alter[ed]\n\nthe conditions of the victim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\n      The dissent merits a reply on three points. First, noting that some of Ms.\n\nNettle’s patients, or the parents of her patients, would call her the “white doctor,”\n\n\n      5\n       The transcript of Ms. Nettle’s testimony spells the word as “gist” rather\nthan “jest.” Because the context makes clear Ms. Nettle was speaking of\n“jesting” behavior, we have altered the transcript. See R. 91 (“Q. What do you\nmean, in gist? A. Just joking . . .”).\n\n                                         -19-\n\fAplt. Br. 37, R. 237–39, the dissent maintains that comments made by patients at\n\nthe Clinic are “relevant to the present inquiry” and that it is not “determinative”\n\nthat “the patients were not employees of the clinic.” Dissent 12. While our\n\nprecedent does not categorically exclude comments made by patients or customers\n\nfrom consideration of a hostile work environment, we believe such claims are of\n\nlittle significance in the context of this case. Ms. Nettle’s patients were children,\n\nand there is no reason to think that their (or their parents’) identification of her as\n\nthe “white doctor” was malicious, intended to be hurtful, or anything other than\n\nmistaken ethnic identification. Ms. Nettle testified that although she went\n\nthrough a stage where it hurt her to be called “white doctor,” and that this would\n\nmake her “angry sometimes,” she “dealt with the children,” who trusted her, and\n\nshe “didn’t find [the comments] as a problem at the very end” because she was so\n\nbusy. R. 237. Moreover, Ms. Nettle presents no evidence that her employer\n\nencouraged her patients to refer to her as the “white doctor,” as opposed to “Ms.\n\nNettle,” only that her co-workers would “hear” patients or their parents calling\n\nher white doctor and “participate in it.” R. 239.\n\n      The dissent cites Lockard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 162 F.3d 1062, 1073 (10th Cir.\n\n1998) to support its assertion that employers may be held responsible for the\n\nconduct of their customers, but the facts of Lockard are suggestive in defining the\n\nlimitations on the argument. In Lockard, Ms. Lockard had been subjected to\n\ncrude, sexually harassing comments and physically threatening conduct (grabbing\n\n                                          -20-\n\fher hair and breast) from a group of customers. Id. at 1072. When told that she\n\ndid not want to serve the harassing customers, as she had on three previous\n\noccasions, her employer responded that she was “hired to be a waitress” and that\n\nshe needed to go serve them. Id. at 1067, 1074–75. Both the nature of the\n\ncomments and the character of the employer’s actions are obviously far afield\n\nfrom those that confronted Ms. Nettle at the Indian Clinic. We do not believe the\n\nfacts show that Ms. Nettle’s employer “condone[d] or tolerate[d]” a hostile work\n\nenvironment based on the scattered comments of her patients or their parents. Id.\n\nat 1073–74.\n\n      Second, the dissent downplays the fact that many of the relevant comments\n\nwere made in jest. The dissent claims that the “[w]hether a comment is intended\n\nto be insulting or ‘in jest’ is irrelevant to whether there is a steady barrage of\n\nopprobrious comments.” Dissent 6. But the case cited by the dissent holds only\n\nthat comments need not be directed at or intended to be received by the victim to\n\nbe evidence of a hostile work environment. EEOC v. PVNF, L.L.C., 487 F.3d\n\n790, 798 (10th Cir. 2007). In that case, we held that vulgar e-mail not intended\n\nfor a recipient, but nonetheless intercepted by her, could be evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. This does not mean that the nonmalicious character of comments,\n\nas understood both by the speakers and by the recipient of the messages, is\n\n“irrelevant” to whether they create a “hostile” or abusive work environment.\n\nPVNF does not hold otherwise, and our caselaw supports the point, under\n\n                                          -21-\n\fcircumstances arguably more humiliating than these. See, e.g., Denetclaw v.\n\nThoutt Bros. Concrete Contractors, 287 Fed. App’x 17, 22 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n(discrimination against Native American who was frequently asked to perform\n\n“rain dances” found not to be severe in part because plaintiff himself\n\n“characterized [the remarks] as joking and kidding”).\n\n      Of course, what is funny to one person may be deeply offensive to another.\n\nWhat the speaker intended by his remark is not dispositive, and racial insults are\n\nnot permissible merely because the speaker regards them as humorous. But Ms.\n\nNettle herself says that she interpreted many of the comments made by Mr.\n\nHunter and others as joking, and not disparaging, because she knew they were not\n\nintended to offend. See R. 240 (calling the years 1996–1999 as “good years” in\n\nwhich Mr. Hunter did not say anything “directly in regard to [Ms. Nettle] other\n\nthan in jest.”); id. at 241 (distinguishing between comments that were “in jest”\n\nand those that were “disparaging”). When evaluating the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we cannot disregard the distinction between jesting and insulting.\n\n      Third, the dissent takes us to task for failing to consider the fact that Ms.\n\nNettle was not selected to represent the Clinic at certain events in our analysis of\n\nthe “totality of circumstances” analysis in the previous section. Dissent 13–14.\n\nIn her testimony, Ms. Nettle pointed to not being allowed to attend the Heritage\n\nCelebration at the state capitol and a Oklahoma University Health Sciences\n\nCenter event, allegedly because as a light-skinned Native American, she did not\n\n                                         -22-\n\f“represent” Native Americans well. R. 264; see also R. 362. We disagree that\n\nnot being able to attend two events which, as we note in the following section,\n\nwere only at best a discretionary part of her job, amounts to discrimination that is\n\n“severe.” Nor does the fact of being prevented from attending two events from a\n\nmany-year career show that Ms. Nettle experienced “pervasive” discrimination\n\nduring her employment at the Clinic.\n\n      From the record, we can see that at many points during her employment,\n\nthe Clinic was not a pleasant place for Ms. Nettle to work. People said crude\n\nthings, pet projects were taken away from her, and she was made to feel singled\n\nout because of her Caucasian appearance. But Title VII’s standard for redress is a\n\nhostile work environment, not an unpleasant one. See, e.g., Duncan v. Manager,\n\nDept. of Safety, City & County of Denver, 397 F.3d 1300, 1313–14 (10th Cir.\n\n2005) (Title VII provides no remedy for boorish behavior or bad taste); Sprague\n\nv. Thorn Americas, Inc., 129 F.3d 1355, 1366 (10th Cir. 1997) (unpleasant and\n\nboorish conduct does not create a hostile work environment). Incidents spread\n\nout over many years, and which indicate mostly poor taste and lack of\n\nprofessionalism, do not rise to the level of a hostile work environment. See, e.g.,\n\nPenry v. Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, 155 F.3d 1257, 1263 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). With all due respect to the dissent, we believe that the dissent’s standard\n\nfor pervasiveness and severity falls short of what this court and the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fCourt have set forth, and would make a broad swath of American workplaces\n\nsubject to liability under Title VII.\n\n      We therefore affirm the district court’s ruling that the Indian Clinic is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Ms. Nettle’s hostile work environment claim.\n\n      B. Adverse Employment Action\n\n      Under Title VII, an employer may not “discriminate against any individual\n\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n\nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). In order to show discrimination Ms. Nettle must\n\nestablish that (1) she is the member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action; (3) she was qualified for the position at issue; and (4)\n\nshe was treated less favorably than others not in the protected class. Piercy v.\n\nMaketa, 480 F.3d 1192, 1203 (10th Cir. 2007). The Clinic does not dispute that\n\nMs. Nettle is in a protected class, which she has “described as ‘light-skinned\n\nNative Americans.’” Dist. Ct. Op. 16. The district court, however, agreed with\n\nthe Clinic that Ms. Nettle failed to make the necessary primary showing that she\n\nhad suffered an adverse employment action. Id. at 18.\n\n      Ms. Nettle concedes that in the period identified in her first EEOC\n\ncharge—March 10, 2004 to October 20, 2004—she “did not lose any salary nor\n\nreceive an official demotion” but that nonetheless “the evidence shows that the\n\nterms and conditions of her employment were altered.” Aplt. Br. 38–39. Ms.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fNettle points to the removal of Thanksgiving and Christmas Drives from her job\n\nfunctions (programs which she had started); her relocation to a new office; not\n\nbeing allowed to set up a booth at the Oklahoma University Health Sciences\n\nCenter; and being pulled from attending Native American Heritage week at the\n\nstate capital, among other things. R. 168–69, 362. It is not evident from the\n\nrecord that the removal of the Thanksgiving and Christmas programs occurred\n\nwithin the time period in which Ms. Nettle alleged discrimination, but even if it\n\ndid, we do not see any of the events cited by Ms. Nettle affecting her terms and\n\nconditions of employment. Although we take a “case by case approach,” and do\n\nnot limit ourselves to finding monetary loses or loss of benefits to constitute an\n\nadverse action, the action must rise above the level of “a mere inconvenience or\n\nan alteration of job responsibilities.” Sanchez v. Denver Pub. Sch., 164 F.3d 527,\n\n532 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Ms. Nettle’s job description included a clause that said she would be\n\nrequired to “perform[] other duties as assigned.” R. 205, 404. She said in her\n\ndeposition that she considered the Thanksgiving and Christmas drives to be part\n\nof the assigned duties. R. 206. But there is no inconsistency with the job\n\ndescription that some duties, once assigned, should later be unassigned as\n\nnecessary. Moreover, the various additional duties she was given do not reach the\n\ncore of the description of her position as “Native American Youth Specialist”: “to\n\nprovide Health Promotion/Disease Prevention services directed towards American\n\n                                         -25-\n\fIndian youth for the Community Services Department.” R. 403. The fact that\n\nMs. Nettle was prevented from attending some external events does not represent\n\na significant change in her employment status. See Piercy, 480 F.3d at 1203\n\n(adverse employment action includes “significant change in employment status,\n\nsuch as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.” (citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n      Because we hold that Ms. Nettle did not suffer an adverse employment\n\naction, we do not reach the other steps in the test for showing discrimination.\n\n                       IV. National Origin Discrimination\n\n      Ms. Nettle finally argues that she should be able to make a claim for\n\nnational origin discrimination, even though she did not check off “national\n\norigin” on her first EEOC charge. The “particulars” of the charge stated that Ms.\n\nNettle and other employees were “being treated differently because of [their] tribe\n\nor skin color.” R. 18 (emphasis added). She also alleged in the particulars that\n\nduring meetings, Mr. Hunter would “make comments about different tribes.” Id.\n\n(emphasis added). The district court found that because Ms. Nettle did not\n\n“identify national origin as a basis for discrimination in her EEOC” charge (by\n\nnot checking the box), she had not administratively exhausted her claim.\n\nAccordingly, it did not permit Ms. Nettle “to expand the scope of [her] lawsuit\n\nand include at this late date” a national origin claim. Dist. Ct. Op. 24.\n\n                                         -26-\n\f      The Ninth Circuit, in a case cited by Ms. Nettle, held that discrimination\n\nagainst an Indian tribe could give rise to a national origin claim under Title VII,\n\nbecause Indian tribes could be “considered nations.” Dawavendewa v. Salt River\n\nProject Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., 154 F.3d 1117, 1120 (9th Cir. 1998) (different\n\nIndian tribes “were at one time considered nations, and indeed still are to a\n\ncertain extent”). The Clinic does not challenge the very idea of national origin\n\ndiscrimination based on membership in a tribe in its brief before us, so we assume\n\nwithout holding that one can bring a legitimate claim of national origin\n\ndiscrimination based on discrimination against one’s tribe.\n\n      We must therefore consider whether Ms. Nettle can be said to have made\n\nsuch a claim in her original charge. To “effectuate the remedial purposes of Title\n\nVII,” courts are to liberally construe charges filed with the EEOC. Harrell v.\n\nSpangler, Inc., 957 F. Supp. 1215, 1219 (D. Kan. 1997). Accordingly, “the\n\ncrucial inquiry is whether the claims set forth in the civil complaint fall within the\n\nscope of the investigation that could reasonably be expected to grow out of the\n\nEEOC charges.” Id. Although Ms. Nettle did not check the box for national\n\norigin in her charge, she did state, in the particulars, that she believed she was\n\nbeing discriminated against because of her tribe. Moreover, in her complaint, Ms.\n\nNettle explained that Mr. Hunter “made statements regarding the Delaware Tribe .\n\n. . as being want-to-be’s which indicates Plaintiff wants to pretend and be like\n\nIndians of browner skin.” R. 26. Mr. Hunter, the complaint continued, “also\n\n                                         -27-\n\fmade statements regarding Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribal employees, Comanche\n\nemployees, Cherokee and Choctaw Tribal employees.” Id.\n\n      It seems clear from the charge that Ms. Nettle was alleging national origin\n\ndiscrimination, and that it provided adequate notice to the Clinic. See Stephens v.\n\nCity of Topeka 33 F. Supp.2d 947, 950 (D. Kan 1999). In Stephens, the plaintiff\n\ndid not check the box “race” on his charge, and wrote in his charge that “I believe\n\nI was treated differently because of my National Origin and my age, because\n\nyounger, white managers/employees . . . were treated differently.” Id. The\n\ndistrict court held that because Mr. Stephens said he was treated differently from\n\nother “white” employees, this suggested he was (also) making an allegation of\n\nracial discrimination. Id. In this case, as well, Ms. Nettle made claims in her\n\ncharge related to Mr. Hunter’s comments about various other tribes, claims which\n\nrelate to Ms. Nettle’s national origin.\n\n      In her Complaint in district court, however, Ms. Nettle did not allege\n\ndiscrimination based on tribe or national origin. Her Complaint alleged\n\ndiscrimination “on account of race and color” alone. Only in her reply to the\n\nClinic’s motion for summary judgement did Ms. Nettle drop her claim of race\n\ndiscrimination only to ask to be “allowed to maintain a cause of action for\n\nnational origin discrimination.” R. 191.\n\n      As noted above, plaintiffs are confined to the claims they timely raise in\n\ntheir complaint. A plaintiff “may not amend her complaint through allegations\n\n                                          -28-\n\fmade in response to a motion for summary judgment.” Griffen v. Potter, 356 F.3d\n\n824, 830 (7th Cir. 2004). Here, concerns about proper notice come to the fore.\n\nIndeed, part of the Clinic’s strategy in its motion for summary judgment was to\n\nconcede that Mr. Hunter had made comments about Ms. Nettle’s tribal affiliation,\n\nbut to argue that statements about tribal affiliation could not support a claim for\n\nrace or color discrimination, which is what Ms. Nettle alleged. R. 59. It hardly\n\nseems fair that Ms. Nettle in reply, could argue that—all along—she was really\n\nalleging national origin discrimination, and that she should be allowed to proceed\n\non those grounds, rather than the grounds which she presented in her Complaint.\n\nWhile Ms. Nettle’s charge could be read as encompassing a national origin\n\ndiscrimination claim, the same cannot be said of her Complaint.\n\n      Even if we were to read Ms. Nettle’s Complaint to encompass national\n\norigin discrimination, we doubt that it could withstand a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Ms. Nettle’s specific (i.e., not vague) race and national origin claims\n\nappear to rely on much the same information we have already considered in\n\nconnection with her claim for color discrimination (for example, that some tribes\n\nhad lighter skin color than other tribes, R. 12). We have already concluded that\n\nthis evidence was insufficient to survive summary judgment. Unless Ms. Nettle\n\nhas other facts, which she did not put forward even in her reply to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment, then the facts pertaining only to national origin\n\ndiscrimination make up a smaller set of the available facts pointing to\n\n                                         -29-\n\fdiscrimination of any kind. If she did not survive summary judgment on the\n\nlarger set of facts, a fortiori, she could not survive it with the smaller set.\n\n                                    V. Conclusion\n\n      We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n                                                  Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                  Michael W. McConnell\n                                                  Circuit Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                           -30-\n\f08-6023, Nettle v. Centr. Okla. Am. Indian Health Council\n\nBRISCOE, J., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n         I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part. With one exception, I\n\nagree with the majority. Regarding the hostile work environment claim, I read\n\nthe majority’s opinion to improperly consider witness credibility, improperly\n\nweigh evidence, and omit meaningful analysis of the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding Nettle’s allegations. Accordingly, I would reverse the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment for the Clinic on Nettle’s hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\n\n         To affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment on Nettle’s hostile\n\nwork environment claim, the majority begins by quoting the standard elements of\n\nsuch a claim—a plaintiff must show that a rational jury could find that the\n\nworkplace was “permeate[d] . . . with ‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s\n\nemployment and create an abusive working environment.’” Maj. Op. at 12\n\n(quoting Tademy v. Union Pac. Corp., 520 F.3d 1149, 1156 (10th Cir. 2008)).\n\nThe majority then implicitly divides Nettle’s allegations into several categories—\n\n“vague” statements, comments “made in jest,” specific statements, patient\n\nstatements, and removed employment duties—and then affirms the grant of\n\nsummary judgment for each category. While I disagree with the majority\n\nopinion’s reasoning for these individual categories, I am more troubled by the\n\nmajority’s parsing of Nettle’s allegations. “[O]ur hostile environment cases\n\fconsistently have emphasized the need for the district court to examine the\n\ntotality of the circumstances when reviewing a summary judgment motion.\n\nIndeed, the very term ‘environment’ indicates that allegedly discriminatory\n\nincidents should not be examined in isolation.” Penry v. Fed. Home Loan Bank\n\nof Topeka, 155 F.3d 1257, 1262 (10th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n\nI.     Divided Allegations\n\nA.     “Vague” Allegations\n\n       The majority reviews the district court’s three-pronged reasoning for\n\ngranting summary judgment. Two of the identified reasons relate to the\n\nspecificity of Nettle’s allegations. E.g., Maj. Op. at 13 (“[S]he has not described\n\nthe exact nature of many of the comments,” and “she cannot recall with any\n\nspecificity the dates when many . . . comments were made.”). 1 The third reason\n\nisolates Nettle’s concession that portions of her employment “were good years.”\n\nId. 2 The majority agrees with the district court’s assessment of Nettle’s\n\n       1\n           Unless otherwise specified, I omit the majority’s quotation of the district court\nopinion.\n       2\n         Nettle was employed with the Clinic for “thirteen[]year[s],” ending in 2004.\nMaj. Op. at 12. Nettle conceded that “[19]96 . . . until [19]99 were good years.” Id. at\n13. The majority opinion makes much of this concession, “not[ing] . . . that Ms. Nettle\nwas employed by the Clinic for over a decade, and that she conceded that she was\ntreated favorably for a significant portion of that time, from 1996 to ‘around 1999.’”\nId. at 16.\n        The majority opinion’s reliance on this time period raises two concerns. First, a\nreasonable inference would be that the last five years of Nettle’s employment were\nnot good years. If three years constitutes a “significant portion” of Nettle’s tenure with\nthe Clinic, then a more recent five years is a more consequential quantity of her\n                                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                              -2-\n\fallegations. Id. at 13 (“The[] [allegations in Nettle’s appellate brief] suffer from\n\nmany of the problems that the district court identified in its opinion.”). The\n\nmajority affirms the grant of summary judgment for this category of Nettle’s\n\nallegations—“that Mr. Hunter [the Chief Executive Officer at the Clinic] would\n\nmake ‘frequent’ racial comments at staff meetings and was generally ‘negative,’\n\nas well as the statements by her co-workers that there was discrimination at the\n\n[C]linic”—by applying the standard that “[v]ague, conclusory statements do not\n\nsuffice to create a genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at 16–17. The majority\n\nopinion also discounts Nettle’s allegations regarding Hunter’s comments by\n\nconcluding, “It cannot be assumed that all of his comments about different tribes,\n\nand about those whose skin is lighter or darker than others, related to her.” Id. at\n\n17 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n      In my view, this reasoning improperly weighs the credibility of Nettle’s\n\nsubmitted evidence and labels comments as “vague and conclusory” when they\n\nare not. Sanders v. Sw. Bell Tel., L.P., 544 F.3d 1101, 1105–06 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n\n\n      2\n        (...continued)\nemployment. Second, I fail to understand how this concession negates her hostile work\nenvironment claim. The central analysis should be the totality of the circumstances\nsurrounding Nettle’s employment. Penry, 155 F.3d at 1262 (“‘A play cannot be\nunderstood on the basis of some of its scenes but only on its entire performance, and\nsimilarly, a discrimination analysis must concentrate not on individual incidents [or\nperiods], but on the overall scenario.’”) (quoting Andrews v. City of Philadelphia, 895\nF.2d 1469, 1484 (3d Cir. 1990)); Maj. Op. at 14 (“After all, the point of such claims is\nthat the discrimination was ongoing and pervasive . . . and not at isolated points in\ntime.”).\n\n                                           -3-\n\f(“[I]t is not our province at the summary judgment stage to . . . make credibility\n\ndeterminations.”).\n\n      As stated by the majority, “Nettle is one-half Caucasian and one-half\n\nNative American, a member of the Delaware/Caddo Tribes.” Maj. Op. at 2.\n\nThere is no dispute that Nettle was a light-skinned Native American, and that\n\nHunter allegedly targeted her for ridicule because of her skin color, including\n\ncomments regarding the Delaware Tribe such as “they want to pretend and be like\n\nIndians of browner skin.” R. 12; R. 154.\n\n      The majority also acknowledges that Nettle alleges that “in 1993 in all staff\n\nmeetings, there would always be at least one discriminatory or racial slur against\n\ndifferent tribal affiliations or lighter-skinned people and from 1993 to her\n\ntermination date [in 2004] there were statements of discrimination by Mr.\n\nHunter,” but the majority characterizes this allegation as “vague.” Maj. Op. at 14\n\n(quotations and alterations omitted). While I concede that the cited statement\n\ncould benefit from more specificity, portions of the statement do not equivocate\n\non the key proofs: frequency, location, content, and target of the alleged offensive\n\ncomments. Nettle’s statement is based on personal knowledge. With the\n\nspecifics she has set forth, she has presented more than a “bald assertion” that she\n\nsuffered from a hostile work environment. Moreover, because Nettle’s statement\n\ndoes not draw any improper inference or implicit conclusion, I do not consider the\n\nstatement to be conclusory.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      I also disagree with the majority’s assertion that “[i]t cannot be assumed\n\nthat all of [Mr. Hunter’s] comments about different tribes, and about those whose\n\nskin is lighter or darker than others, related to [Nettle].” Maj. Op. at 17. At the\n\nsummary judgment stage, “we must construe all facts and reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party.” Bryant v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. I-38, 334 F.3d\n\n928, 931 (10th Cir. 2003). Here, Nettle is the non-moving party. If Nettle’s\n\nallegations are true, which must be assumed at this stage, then this evidence\n\nwould support her hostile work environment claim because it demonstrates a\n\nworkplace “permeate[d] . . . with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsult.” Tademy, 520 F.3d at 1156 (internal quotation omitted). It should be the\n\nrole of a fact finder in this case, and not the district court on summary judgment,\n\nto determine whether the alleged comments made to and about Nettle altered the\n\nconditions of her employment.\n\nB.    “Comments made in jest”\n\n      The majority also discredits portions of Nettle’s allegations as comments\n\nmade only in jest. Maj. Op. at 19, 21–22. The majority highlights that “as Ms.\n\nNettle concedes, many of the comments were made jokingly.” Id. at 19 (listing\n\nrecord citations where Nettle identifies comments as being made “in jest”).\n\nIndeed, the majority notes that in certain circumstances Nettle “no longer found a\n\nstaff member’s comments offensive because as the years wore on [Nettle] knew\n\nshe didn’t mean them disparagingly.” Id. at 19 (quotation and alterations\n\n                                          -5-\n\fomitted). Although the majority acknowledges that “what is funny to one person\n\nmay be deeply offensive to another,” the majority proclaims that “we cannot\n\ndisregard the distinction between jesting and insulting.” Id. at 22. Accordingly,\n\nthe majority determines that Nettle’s allegations of comments made “in jest” are\n\ninsufficient to create an abusive working environment, stating “where comments\n\nare made in jest and the plaintiff recognizes them as such, unless they are of\n\nunusual pervasiveness or severity, they cannot ordinarily be regarded as having\n\n‘alter[ed] the conditions of the victim’s employment and create[d] an abusive\n\nworking environment.” Id. at 19 (citing Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510 U.S. 17,\n\n22 (1993)).\n\n      I consider this analysis flawed for several reasons. Whether a comment is\n\nintended to be insulting or “in jest” is irrelevant to whether there is a steady\n\nbarrage of opprobrious comments. See EEOC v. PVNF, L.L.C., 487 F.3d 790,\n\n798 (10th Cir. 2007) (“We have never held, nor would we, that to be subjected to\n\na hostile work environment the discriminatory conduct must be both directed at\n\nthe victim and intended to be received by the victim.”). The analysis for whether\n\na statement contributed to a hostile work environment is whether the “victim\n\nherself perceived the environment to be abusive” and whether the statement was\n\n“so severe or pervasive that an objectively reasonable person would find it\n\nabusive or hostile.” Williams v. W.D. Sports, N.M., Inc., 497 F.3d 1079, 1089\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 21). Thus, statements intended to be\n\n                                          -6-\n\f“in jest” can still be opprobrious if they are subjectively and objectively severe or\n\npervasive. No analysis of the “jester’s” intent is necessary.\n\n      The majority responds that “[t]his does not mean that the nonmalicious\n\ncharacter of comments, as understood both by the speakers and by the recipient of\n\nthe messages, is ‘irrelevant’ to whether they create a ‘hostile’ or abusive work\n\nenvironment.” Maj. Op. at 21. I agree with a portion of this statement. If the\n\nrecipient of the messages finds the comments to be nonmalicious, the comment\n\nfails the subjective portion of the analysis. In that context, the statements made\n\n“in jest” would not contribute to a hostile work environment. Conversely,\n\nstatements that only the speaker considers nonmalicious—but the recipient\n\nconsiders offensive—could contribute to a hostile work environment if they are\n\nobjectively severe or pervasive.\n\n      The majority overlooks this distinction. The majority relies on Nettle’s\n\nstatement that some of the statements were made in jest and that she did not find\n\ncertain, but not all, comments “disparaging[] because she knew they were not\n\nintended to offend,” id. at 23, as license for the majority to disregard all\n\ncomments made “in jest.” Simply because Nettle identified comments as “in jest”\n\ndoes not mean that the comments were not subjectively and objectively severe or\n\npervasive. Moreover, Nettle’s ability to distinguish offensive comments from\n\ncomments received “in jest” and considered to be nonmalicious arguably lends\n\ncredence to her allegations of frequent racial comments that were not received “in\n\n                                          -7-\n\fjest.” Thus, the majority’s conclusion—“where comments are made in jest and\n\nthe plaintiff recognizes them as such,” these identified comments cannot support a\n\nhostile work environment claim—is not universally applicable to all comments\n\nmade “in jest.” Id. at 19. Because the majority makes no effort to distinguish\n\nbetween comments made “in jest” that Nettle considered offensive and comments\n\nmade “in jest” that Nettle considered nonmalicious, the majority’s assertion that\n\n“we cannot disregard the distinction between jesting and insulting” is specious.\n\nId. at 23.\n\n       In addition to blurring the subjective and objective analysis, the majority’s\n\ndiscussion of comments made “in jest” also subtly raises the threshold for hostile\n\nwork environment claims to be actionable. The majority notes that comments\n\nmade in jest cannot “be regarded as having ‘alter[ed] the conditions of the\n\nvictim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working environment,” “unless\n\nthey are of unusual pervasiveness or severity.” Id. at 19 (citing Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 22) (emphasis added). First, although the defendant in Harris “claimed he was\n\nonly joking,” the analysis of Harris does not address or distinguish comments\n\nmade in jest. Harris, 510 U.S. at 19. Second, Harris notes that “Title VII is\n\nviolated” when the discriminatory comments are “sufficiently severe or pervasive\n\nto alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” Id. at 21 (emphasis added). I consider the majority’s “unusually”\n\nsevere or pervasive standard to create a higher threshold of proof for Nettle than\n\n                                          -8-\n\fthe accepted “sufficiently” severe or pervasive standard. Consequently, the\n\nmajority cites Harris, but heightens the standard Harris set forth. Harris,\n\nhowever, clarifies that the “severe or pervasive” standard is the baseline for\n\nactionable hostile work environment claims and rejects a more stringent standard.\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\nC.     Specific Allegations\n\n       On the other hand, the majority admits that “[s]ome of this vagueness is\n\ninconsequential.” Maj. Op. at 14. The majority then lists some “specific\n\nremarks”: (1) “Mr. Hunter commented that Ms[.] Nettle ‘thinks she’s Indian, but\n\nwe wonder. We have been trying to get rid of her since the day we hired her,”\n\nid.; (2) “Mr. Hunter also said . . . that people who did not look Indian ‘don’t\n\nrepresent the Indian community well,’” id.; (3) “Daren Paddyaker[] remark[ed]\n\nthat Ms. Nettle was a ‘wannabe Indian,’” id. at 15; (4) “Dawn Singleton[]\n\ncomment[ed] that [Nettle] was the ‘white counselor,’” id.; (5) “Robyn Sunday, the\n\nChief Operating Officer of the [C]linic, referred to Ms. Nettle as ‘the big-boobed\n\nwhite Renee’ on several occasions,” 3 id.; (6) “[T]wo employees allege that those\n\nwho did not appear ‘Indian’ were treated differently at the Clinic,” id.; and (7)\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority chides the dissent for “focus[ing]” on this alleged description and\nconsiders the “sting in the comment [to be] its sexism.” Maj. Op. at 18 n.4. This\ncriticism by the majority for “focus[ing]” on Sunday’s description is puzzling as this\nreference to the description, which quotes the majority opinion, is the only reference to\nthe full description. Further, by finding “sting” in only the sexist portion of the remark,\nthe majority disregards entirely the “white Renee” portion of the description.\n\n                                            -9-\n\f“[C]hild patients at the Clinic, and their parents, would sometimes refer to her as\n\n‘white doctor,’” id. The majority affirms the grant of summary judgment for\n\nthese specific allegations because they “constitute ‘sporadic . . . slurs’ rather than\n\na ‘steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments.’” 4 Id. at 16 (quoting Bolden v.\n\nPRC Inc., 43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1994)). The majority opinion also reduces\n\nmany of these allegations to “simply identify[ing] her as ‘white’” and concludes\n\nthat “it could be annoying and irritating for a person of one racial mix to be\n\nmistaken for another, but there is no precedent for regarding a mistaken racial\n\nidentifier . . . as opprobrious or abusive.” Id. at 18.\n\n      By quoting the “steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments” language,\n\nthe majority disregards several aspects of Nettle’s allegations and Tenth Circuit\n\nprecedent. Some of Nettle’s allegations involve more than comments; Nettle also\n\nalleged discriminatory conduct. Some of Nettle’s allegations include a steady\n\nbarrage of comments; Nettle also alleged that at “staff meetings, there would\n\n\n\n      4\n        The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that “[f]or . . . harassment to be\nactionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the\nvictim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.” Meritor Sav. Bank,\nFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 67 (1986) (quotation omitted); Pa. State Police v. Suders,\n542 U.S. 129, 133 (2004). This court has analyzed the severe or pervasive element by\napplying the majority’s “steady barrage of opprobrious [] comments” language in\nseveral opinions. E.g., Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 474 F.3d 675, 680 (10th Cir.\n2007) (quoting Chavez v. New Mexico, 397 F.3d 826, 832 (10th Cir. 2005); Ford v.\nWest, 222 F.3d 767, 777 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting Bolden v. PRC Inc., 43 F.3d 545,\n551 (10th Cir. 1994)). Arguably, by requiring a “steady barrage” and “opprobrious\ncomments,” this application has improperly converted a disjunctive analysis, “severe or\npervasive,” into a conjunctive analysis, requiring “severe and pervasive.”\n\n                                          -10-\n\falways be at least one discriminatory or racial slur against different tribal\n\naffiliations or lighter-skinned people.” Maj. Op. at 14 (internal quotation\n\nomitted). Similarly, given that three of the listed seven specific allegations\n\ninclude ongoing conduct—Sunday’s insulting description of Nettle being made\n\n“on several occasions,” that “those who did not appear ‘Indian’ were treated\n\ndifferently at the Clinic,” and that Clinic patients and their parents “would\n\nsometimes refer to her as ‘white doctor’”—there is no basis for the majority’s\n\ndescription of the conduct targeting Nettle as “sporadic” in nature.\n\n      There is also no basis to support the majority opinion’s conclusion\n\nregarding racial misidentification. It is unclear how the majority opinion could\n\nfind only mistaken racial identity in such comments as, “Nettle thinks she’s\n\nIndian, but we wonder” or “wannabe Indian.” Id. at 14–15. To the contrary, in\n\nthis context it is clear that the description “white Renee” is likely not an example\n\nof mistaken racial identity. To me, affirming a grant of summary judgment on\n\ndiscriminatory comments regarding a person’s skin color merits more precise\n\nanalysis because words and epithets regarding a person’s race and color can be\n\n“intensely degrading.” See PVNF, 487 F.3d at 799 (quoting Winsor v. Hinckley\n\nDodge, Inc., 79 F.3d 996, 1000 (10th Cir. 1996) and considering a sexual epithet);\n\nRodgers v. W.-S. Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 668, 675 (7th Cir. 1993) (“Perhaps no\n\nsingle act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an\n\nabusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet . . .\n\n                                         -11-\n\fby a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.”) (internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted).\n\nD.     Patient Statements\n\n       Nettle alleges that “the patients [of the Clinic] would call her the ‘white\n\ndoctor.’” Aplt. Br. at 37; R. 183, 234. The majority opinion “believe[s] such\n\nclaims are of little significance in the context of this case,” because “Nettle\n\npresents no evidence that her employer encouraged her patients to refer to her as\n\nthe ‘white doctor . . . .’” Id. at 20.\n\n       Because comments made by the patients and their parents are part of\n\nNettle’s workplace environment, they are relevant to the present inquiry. That the\n\npatients and their parents were not employees of the Clinic is not determinative.\n\nThe Clinic may be held responsible for comments by its patients and their parents\n\nbecause there is evidence that they should have known about such comments. See\n\nLockard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., 162 F.3d 1062, 1073 (10th Cir. 1998) (“We agree with\n\nour sister circuits that an employer may be found liable for the harassing conduct\n\nof its customers.”); id. at 1074 (“[E]mployers may be held liable in these\n\ncircumstances if they fail to remedy or prevent a hostile or offensive work\n\nenvironment of which management-level employees knew, or in the exercise of\n\nreasonable care should have known.” (quotation omitted)). Accepting Nettle’s\n\nallegations as true, if the Clinic introduced Nettle as “white,” it should expect its\n\npatients and their parents to follow suit and refer to Nettle as “white.” By this\n\n                                          -12-\n\fconduct—although it is not clear that the threshold standard requires Nettle to\n\npresent such evidence—the Clinic arguably has “encouraged” the patients and\n\ntheir parents to refer to Nettle as “white.”\n\nE.    Removed Employment Duties\n\n      While the majority lists the allegation that “Mr. Hunter said . . . that\n\npeople who did not look Indian ‘don’t represent the Indian community well,’”\n\nMaj. Op. at 14, Nettle also alleges that she was prevented from representing the\n\nClinic at certain events because she did not “look Indian.” Aplt. Br. at 37; R.\n\n168, 246. With little analysis, the majority opinion brushes these allegations\n\naside as being not severe or pervasive. Maj. Op. at 23 (“We disagree that not\n\nbeing able to attend two events which, . . . were only at best a discretionary part\n\nof her job, amounts to discrimination that is ‘severe.’ Nor does the fact of being\n\nprevented from attending two events from a many-year career show that Ms.\n\nNettle experienced ‘pervasive’ discrimination during her employment at the\n\nClinic.”).\n\n      Although the majority would discount this evidence, I consider Nettle’s\n\nallegations that she was prevented from representing the Clinic in the community\n\nbecause she did not “look Indian” to be relevant to and give weight to her hostile\n\nwork environment claim. These allegations, if assumed to be true, are indicative\n\nof a workplace where Nettle’s skin color impacted her employment status with\n\nher employer, her co-workers, and the community the Clinic served. Further,\n\n                                          -13-\n\fthese allegations contradict other portions of the majority’s reasoning. The\n\nmajority dismisses all of Nettle’s specific allegations as sporadic or infrequent\n\n“comments.” Prohibiting Nettle from representing the Clinic because of her skin\n\ncolor is not a comment; it is an action that directly affects Nettle’s work\n\nresponsibilities, performance, and status. Only examining whether this alleged\n\nconduct was by itself “severe” or “pervasive” disregards the impact of the\n\nconduct in the coherent analysis of whether her workplace environment was\n\n“permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment.”\n\nMcCowan v. All Star Maint., Inc., 273 F.3d 917, 923 (10th Cir. 2001); Tademy,\n\n520 F.3d at 1162 (listing “whether it unreasonably interferes with [her] work\n\nperformance” as a consideration in analyzing the frequency or severity of the\n\ndiscriminatory conduct).\n\nII.   The Totality of the Circumstances\n\n      In my view, the most problematic aspect of the majority’s divide-and-\n\nconquer analysis is that it does not consider Nettle’s allegations in the context of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances. We have rejected this approach. See PVNF,\n\n487 F.3d at 799 (“By parsing out the various instances of harassment and\n\ncharacterizing them as gender-neutral, or not pervasive, [the employer] seeks to\n\neschew the proper totality of the circumstances test, which is the touchstone of\n\nour analysis of hostile work environment claims.” (quotation omitted)).\n\n                                         -14-\n\fMoreover, any totality of the circumstances analysis should be considered “‘from\n\nthe perspective of a reasonable person in [Nettle’s] position.’” McCowan, 273\n\nF.3d at 923 (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 81\n\n(1998)).\n\n      There is no indication that the majority considered these circumstances\n\nfrom the viewpoint of a reasonable person in Nettle’s position. Instead, the\n\nmajority parses and dismisses allegations of discriminatory conduct without\n\nregard to Nettle’s circumstances. E.g., Maj. Op. at 16 (“Nettle’s allegations of\n\nidentifiable discriminatory or harassing conduct constitute ‘sporadic . . . slurs’\n\nrather than a ‘steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments.”); id. (“Nettle’s\n\nclaims that Mr. Hunter would make ‘frequent’ racial comments at staff meetings\n\nand was generally ‘negative,’ as well as the statements by her co-workers that\n\nthere was discrimination at the clinic, do not rise to the level of creating a\n\ngenuine dispute.”); id. at 19 (“Where comments are made in jest and the plaintiff\n\nrecognizes them as such, unless they are of unusual pervasiveness or severity,\n\nthey cannot ordinarily be regarded as having ‘alter[ed] the conditions of the\n\nvictim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working environment.’”); id. at 21\n\n(“We do not believe the facts show that Ms. Nettle’s employer ‘condone[d] or\n\ntolderate[d]’ a hostile work environment based on the scattered comments of her\n\npatients and their parents.”); id. at 23 (“We disagree that not being able to attend\n\ntwo events which, . . . were only at best a discretionary part of her job, amounts\n\n                                          -15-\n\fto discrimination that is ‘severe’ [or pervasive].”). By segregating subsets of\n\nallegations and then analyzing each subset in isolation, the majority fails to\n\nconsider the totality of the circumstances when addressing Nettle’s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. See McCowan, 273 F.3d at 925 (suggesting that even conduct\n\nthat is not explicitly discriminatory may still form a part of the totality of the\n\ncircumstances).\n\n      The majority’s sole effort to put all of these allegations together in context\n\nacknowledges that, “the Clinic was not a pleasant place for Ms. Nettle to work.\n\nPeople said crude things, pet projects were taken away from her, and she was\n\nmade to feel singled out because of her Caucasian appearance.” Maj. Op. at 23.\n\nThe majority, however, concludes that “Title VII’s standard for redress is a\n\nhostile work environment, not an unpleasant one,” stating that Title VII does not\n\nremedy boorish, unpleasant conduct and bad taste. Id.\n\n      By this reasoning, the majority either improperly weighs evidence or\n\nreduces hostile work environment claims to semantics. It is axiomatic that at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, “it is not our province . . . to weigh the evidence . . . .”\n\nSanders, 544 F.3d at 1105–06. In the context of hostile work environment claims,\n\nthis prohibition against weighing evidence gains significance as we have noted\n\nthat the “severity and pervasiveness evaluation is particularly unsuited for\n\nsummary judgment because it is quintessentially a question of fact.” Herrera, 474\n\nF.3d at 680 (quotation omitted).\n\n                                          -16-\n\f      Based on these precedents, I cannot agree with the majority’s\n\ncharacterization of Nettle’s workplace as merely “unpleasant” and not “hostile.”\n\nNettle does not allege simply boorish conduct or behavior in bad taste. She\n\nalleges conduct that “singled [her] out because of her Caucasian appearance,”\n\nMaj. Op. at 23, including frequent racially-based comments, jokes, and decisions\n\nthat impacted her job duties. The majority offers no explanation for why Nettle’s\n\nsubjective view of her workplace is objectively insufficient to support her hostile\n\nwork environment claim.\n\n      In the final analysis, I would conclude that Nettle’s allegations, taken as a\n\nwhole, are sufficient to create a question of fact as to whether her workplace was\n\n“permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment.”\n\nMcCowan, 273 F.3d at 923. I would reverse the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on Nettle’s hostile work environment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f",

She filed a civil rights suit against the Clinic. The Clinic\n\nwas granted summary judgment on all claims. Ms. Nettle appeals, and we affirm\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n      *\n       This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited,\nhowever, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th\nCir. R. 32.1.\n\f                                     I. Facts\n\n      Ms. Nettle is a one-half Caucasian and one-half Native American, a\n\nmember of the Delaware/Caddo Tribes. She is light-skinned and sometimes\n\nmistaken for a Caucasian. Ms. Nettle testified that she was “[b]y far” the person\n\nwith the “lightest skin color” in the family services, R. 238, and that “most people\n\nto look at me they don’t see me as Indian, identifiably Indian.” R. 243. Ms.\n\nNettle worked for the Oklahoma City Indian Clinic (“the Clinic”), whose\n\n“primary function is to provide medical and other health-related services to\n\nNative Americans.” R. 11. The Clinic is part of the Indian Health Service (IHS),\n\nwhich is permitted by law to give a hiring preference for Native Americans.\n\nAccording to the Indian Health Service website:\n\n      The purpose of this hiring preference is to support Indian participation in\n      self-government, to further the Government’s trust obligations to tribes, to\n      encourage American Indians and Alaska Natives to pursue higher\n      education, and to enhance the positive effect of having Indians administer\n      matters that affect Indian tribal life. The preference is granted to Indians\n      not as a racial group but as members of sovereign tribal entities. The\n      legislative history of Indian Preference hiring law reflects Congress’\n      awareness that non-Indians would be at an employment disadvantage in the\n      IHS and the BIA.\n\nhttp://info.ihs.gov/Infrastructure/Infrastructure7.pdf. Ms. Nettle worked for about\n\neleven years (August 13, 1993 to December 31, 2003) as a Child Development\n\nSpecialist in the Clinic’s Community Services Department. Dist. Ct. Op. 1. From\n\nJanuary 1, 2004, until her termination in November of that year, her job title was\n\nNative American Youth Specialist. R. 11. As a Child Development Specialist,\n\n                                        -2-\n\fMs. Nettle’s duties included working with and counseling Native American\n\nfamilies and their children, although she was never licensed as a counselor. Dist.\n\nCt. Op. 2. As Native American Youth Specialist, Ms. Nettle’s job was to\n\n“provide Health Promotion/Disease Prevention services directed towards\n\nAmerican Indian youth” and she was responsible for “mental health, substance\n\nabuse and social work service issues[.]” Dist. Ct. Op. 2. During her time at the\n\nClinic, Ms. Nettle received positive job evaluations, and was never subject to any\n\ndisciplinary action. R. 12; R. 112–16. She had been called a “wonderful asset”\n\nto the Clinic. Dist. Ct. Op. 3.\n\n      The Chief Executive Officer at the Clinic was Terry Hunter, who is part\n\nCaucasian and part Native American, with tribal membership in the Kiowa Tribe\n\nand with tribal affiliation in the Delaware Nation and the Caddo Tribe. Aple. Br.\n\n6. His skin pigmentation is darker than Ms. Nettle’s. R. 12, 83, 163, 237–38. In\n\nher complaint before the district court, Ms. Nettle said that Mr. Hunter would\n\nmake “frequent comments in the workplace about different Native American\n\ntribes whose skin colors were lighter or darker than other Native American\n\ntribes,” and suggested that some employees were too “white.” R. 26. Mr. Hunter\n\nalso, according to Ms. Nettle, said of her that “she thinks she’s Indian, but we\n\nwonder” and “on other occasions” made “derogatory statements about the\n\nDelaware tribe . . . [such as] that ‘they want to pretend and be like Indians of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fbrowner skin.’” R. 12; R. 154. Although she knew that some of the comments\n\nmight have been in jest, she still found many of them offensive. R. 171.\n\n       Ms. Nettle also accused Robyn Sunday, the Clinic’s Chief Operating\n\nOfficer, of making derisive comments about Ms. Nettle and her appearance,\n\nsaying at one point that she wanted to fire “white Renee.” R. 13. And she asserts\n\nthat patients in the Clinic would call her the “white doctor.” Aplt. Br. 37.\n\n       In addition to the comments directed at her, Ms. Nettle alleges that the\n\nClinic “removed several activities for which [she] was responsible and gave them\n\nto other employees.” R. 168. The reason for this, she alleges, was because Mr.\n\nHunter believed that her light skin and Caucasian appearance rendered her a poor\n\nrepresentative for the Clinic in the Native American community. Aplt. Br. 5.\n\n       Ms. Nettle eventually filed a Charge of Discrimination with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) on October 22, 2004. She\n\nchecked off the boxes on the form indicating that she was claiming discrimination\n\nbased on race, color, and age. The text of the charge read that “Mr. Hunter would\n\nmake comments about different tribes, and about those whose skin is lighter or\n\ndarker than others. I and other employees are treated differently because of our\n\ntribe or skin color.” R. 390. The document put March 10, 2004 as the earliest\n\ndate discrimination took place and October 20 as the latest. Id. In March 2004,\n\nthe Clinic had canceled youth activities of which Ms. Nettle was in charge. R.\n\n163.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f      On November 1, Ms. Nettle was placed on “administrative leave pending an\n\ninvestigation” into two matters: a memo Ms. Nettle had written on October 27\n\ndenying responsibility for a break-in at the Clinic offices, and whether Ms. Nettle\n\nhad counseled a patient after being directed not to. Dist. Ct. Op. 7. Despite\n\nhaving been placed on administrative leave, Ms. Nettle used a Clinic van that\n\nsame day to deliver materials for a Clinic function. Id. Ms. Nettle testified that\n\nshe had been instructed by her supervisor to go ahead and transport the materials.\n\nAplt. Br. 9; R. 101.\n\n      In a letter dated November 1, 2004, Ms. Nettle was informed that she had\n\nbeen fired, effective November 1, 2004, for “misconduct,” including her\n\ncontinuation of “counseling patients after being given a directive to cease all\n\nindividual counseling.” Dist. Ct. Op. 8. Ms. Nettle filed a second EEOC charge\n\nalleging that she had been terminated in retaliation for filing her first EEOC\n\nCharge. R. 14. The Notice of Discrimination the Clinic received for Ms. Nettle’s\n\nfirst charge was dated November 5, 2004, four days after the Clinic fired Ms.\n\nNettle, suggesting that the termination could not have been in retaliation for the\n\ncharge. Dist Ct. Op. 9. Ms. Nettle, however, testified that she had filed her\n\ncharge on October 22 and that an employee with the EEOC told her she would\n\nfaxing her Charge to the Clinic “immediately” and “that day.” R. 274, 285.\n\n      Ms. Nettle filed suit against the Clinic in federal district court on\n\nNovember 4, 2005. R. 2. In her original complaint, she alleged race and color\n\n                                          -5-\n\fdiscrimination, claiming that the comments of Mr. Hunter and others created a\n\nhostile work environment. She also alleged that she was fired in retaliation for\n\nfiling her first EEOC charge. R. 29, 30. Ms. Nettle did not plead age\n\ndiscrimination in her original complaint, although she had checked off the box in\n\nher EEOC Charge, and she eventually conceded it. R. 56, 191. She also later\n\nconceded her claim for race discrimination. R. 191, 394. But in her reply to the\n\nClinic’s motion for summary judgment, Ms. Nettle asked the court to allow her to\n\nmaintain a cause of action for discrimination based on national origin. R. 191.\n\n      The district court granted the Clinic’s motion for summary judgment. The\n\ndistrict court held that (1) under the “totality of the circumstances,” no reasonable\n\njuror could find that the comments that were directed at Ms. Nettle created a\n\nhostile work environment, (2) Ms. Nettle did not make a prima facie showing that\n\nshe had been treated adversely because of her skin color, and (3) there was no\n\ncausal connection between Ms. Nettle’s filing her first EEOC charge and the\n\nClinic’s decision to fire her, hence no retaliatory termination. Dist. Ct. Op. 15,\n\n18, 21. The district court also held that her national origin claim was not\n\nadministratively exhausted, because she did not “identify national origin as a\n\nbasis for discrimination in her EEOC Charges of Discrimination.” Id. at 24.\n\n      Ms. Nettle appeals. We review the district court’s decision de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standard used by the district court, McKenzie v. Dovala,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"160850\"><a href=\"/opinion/160850/mckenzie-v-dovala/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 969 (10th Cir. 2001). Summary judgment is appropriate only if\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law. Id. “When applying this standard, we view the\n\nevidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party,” and the nonmovant is given “wide berth to prove a factual\n\ncontroversy exists.” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n                            II. Retaliatory Discharge\n\n      Ms. Nettle argues that the court erred in finding that she had not made a\n\nprima facie showing of retaliatory discharge. In her second filed EEOC Charge,\n\nMs. Nettle said that she believed that she had been retaliated against “for\n\ncomplaining of protected activity in my . . . charge still pending before the\n\nCommission.” R. 33. To prove a prima facie case for retaliation, Ms. Nettle must\n\nshow that she engaged in protected activity, that the Clinic took a material\n\n“adverse action” against her, and that there was a causal connection between the\n\nprotected activity and the adverse action. See Montes v. Vail Clinic, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169621\"><a href=\"/opinion/169621/montes-v-vail-clinic-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1176 (10th Cir. 2007). The district court noted that it was\n\n“undisputed” that filing an EEOC charge is protected activity, against which the\n\nClinic could not have retaliated by firing Ms. Nettle. Dist. Ct. Op. 19. This\n\nleaves Ms. Nettle’s burden to show that there was a causal connection between\n\nthe filing of the EEOC charge (the protected activity) and her termination (the\n\nadverse action).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f      The Clinic objected that Ms. Nettle could not show a causal connection,\n\nand the district court agreed. Ms. Nettle filed her first Charge of Discrimination\n\non October 22, 2004, and the Clinic fired her on November 1 of that same year.\n\nA causal connection between an employee’s protected activity and an employer’s\n\nadverse action “may be demonstrated by evidence of circumstances that justify an\n\ninference of retaliatory motive,” such as when the protected conduct is “closely\n\nfollowed” by an adverse action. Burrus v. United Telephone Co. of Kan., Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406284\"><a href=\"/opinion/406284/29-fair-emplpraccas-663-29-empl-prac-dec-p-32932-jewel-burrus-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">683</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 343 (10th Cir. 1982). But the Clinic maintains that it was not\n\naware that Ms. Nettle had filed her Charge with the EEOC until November 4, so\n\nthat it could not have fired her because of the charge, even if it fired her after she\n\nfiled the charge. See Jones v. U.P.S., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169770\"><a href=\"/opinion/169770/jones-v-ups-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (10th Cir. 2007)\n\n(“Unless an employer knows that an employee is engaging in protected activity, it\n\ncannot retaliate against that employee because of the protected conduct . . . .”),\n\nWilliams v.

Although\n\nMs. Nettle conceded in her deposition that she had no first-hand knowledge that\n\nthe Clinic received her charge prior to her termination, she says she called Ms.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fHill later in the day of October 22 and Ms. Hill told her “she had faxed it,”\n\nmeaning the charge.

Ms. Nettle’s testimony that Ms. Hill\n\ntold her that she (Hill) had faxed the charge on October 22 is inadmissible\n\nhearsay. Ms. Nettle could have obtained testimony from Ms. Hill directly, but did\n\nnot. Accordingly, there is no admissible evidence in the record showing that the\n\nClinic received the charge prior to Ms. Nettle’s termination on November 1.\n\n      Alternatively, Ms. Nettle argues that the “protected activity” that caused\n\nher firing was more than simply her filing of an EEOC charge. Appellant’s Br.\n\n15. The district court held that Ms. Nettle’s retaliation charge “did not complain\n\nthat she was retaliated against because she voiced informal complaints to\n\nsuperiors or co-workers, because she disagreed with her placement on\n\nadministrative leave or because she believed her placement on administrative\n\nleave was discriminatory.” Dist. Ct. Op. 19 n.14. Ms. Nettle contends that the\n\ndistrict court erred by reading her retaliation charge this “narrowly,” and that the\n\nprotected activity for which she suffered retaliation included earlier internal\n\ncomplaints to her superiors and co-workers.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      Ms. Nettle is correct that “informal complaints” can be considered as\n\nprotected activity.

There is some garbled syntax here. (Why would she\n\nbe retaliated against for complaining of protected activity?) But the meaning of\n\nthe charge seems straightforward: Ms. Nettle charged that she had been\n\nterminated because she complained about discrimination in “the above-mentioned\n\ncharge,” which was her first Charge of Discrimination before the EEOC.\n\nMoreover, the “particulars” of the charge support this straightforward reading. In\n\nher second charge, Ms. Nettle recites that she filed her first charge of\n\ndiscrimination on October 22 and was fired on November 1. She then identifies\n\nwho notified her of her termination and then concludes with the statement in\n\nquestion (“I believe I have been retaliated against . . .”), with no mention of any\n\nother protected activity. Further evidence in support of the district court’s\n\ninterpretation: Ms. Nettle entitled the second cause of action in her complaint\n\n“retaliation for filing a charge of discrimination.” R. 16.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f      We agree with Ms. Nettle that we must read her charge liberally.

The investigation called for by the language\n\nof the charge is obvious and limited: to see whether she had been retaliated\n\nagainst for filing her first charge of discrimination.

The district court held that\n\n“some of the comments and remarks”of her co-workers and supervisors could\n\nhave caused Ms. Nettle subjectively to perceive that her working environment\n\nwas hostile and abusive. Dist. Ct. Op. 13–14. But it also held that “from the\n\nobjective standpoint,” the “harassment or offensive conduct over the thirteen-year\n\nemployment period was not sufficiently constant or frequent . . . that it could be\n\n                                         -12-\n\fconsidered sufficiently pervasive or severe to survive summary judgment.” Id. at\n\n15.\n\n      The district court highlighted three deficiencies it saw in Ms. Nettle’s case.\n\nFirst, it noted that, although Ms. Nettle had “named many individuals who she . . .\n\ncontended harassed her. . . . [she] has not attributed offensive remarks to many of\n\nthese alleged harassers, and she has not described the exact nature of many of the\n\ncomments.” Dist. Ct. Op. 14. Second, it noted that Ms. Nettle “had admitted\n\nthat she cannot recall with any specificity the dates when many . . . comments\n\nwere made.” Id. Finally, although Ms. Nettle claimed to have been subjected to\n\ndiscrimination throughout her employment, “she has conceded that ‘[19]96 . . .\n\nuntil [19]99 were good years” and that she did not recall that Mr. Hunter directed\n\nany offensive comments at her during that time, except in jest. Id. at 15; see R.\n\n242–43 (describing that in those years Mr. Hunter would “speak with [her]. .\n\n[and] promote any activities that [she] initiated or attempted to initiate or present;\n\nany requisition or anything [she] requested in regard to [her] youth groups wasn’t\n\ndenied.”).\n\n      Ms. Nettle asks us to reverse the district court’s holding. Her brief points\n\nto several pages in the record which summarize “the instances of discrimination\n\nbecause of her skin color” that Ms. Nettle alleges she has suffered. Aplt. Br. at\n\n27. These stated instances suffer from many of the problems that the district\n\ncourt identified in its opinion. Dates are left unspecified. Ms. Nettle admitted\n\n                                         -13-\n\fagain and again that she could not recall the dates or events at which Mr. Hunter\n\nallegedly made the discriminatory comments. R. 167, 88–89. She also identified\n\nother people as making discriminatory remarks, but likewise could not give\n\nspecific dates or events at which they were made. R. 90–91, 93, 95. Many of her\n\nallegations against Mr. Hunter are vague. In her deposition, she said that “[i]n\n\n1993 in all staff meetings,” there would always be “at least one discriminatory or\n\nracial slur against different tribal affiliations or lighter-skinned people,” and from\n\n“1993 to [her] termination date there were statements of discrimination by Mr.\n\nHunter.” R. 88–89. In short, “[e]verything in a negative nature” came from Mr.\n\nHunter. R. 250.\n\n      Some of this vagueness is inconsequential. A hostile work environment\n\nclaimant need not establish precise dates for every insult. After all, the point of\n\nsuch claims is that the discrimination was ongoing and pervasive, that is, all the\n\ntime, and not at isolated points in time. See, e.g., Rocha Vigil v. City of Las\n\nCruces, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744144\"><a href=\"/opinion/744144/mary-ann-rocha-vigil-v-city-of-las-cruces/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875 (10th Cir. 1997). Moreover, Ms. Nettle does recall\n\nsome specific remarks by Mr. Hunter and others. She testified that Mr. Hunter\n\ncommented that Ms. Nettle “thinks she’s Indian, but we wonder. We have been\n\ntrying to get rid of her since the day we hired her.” R. 167–68. Mr. Hunter also\n\nsaid, according to Ms. Nettle, that people who did not look Indian “don’t\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\frepresent the Indian community well.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Rawle</span> <span class=\"page\">246</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In addition, she points to\n\nspecific remarks by other clinic members, for example, Daren Paddyaker’s remark\n\nthat Ms. Nettle was a “wannabe Indian,” and Dawn Singleton’s comment that she\n\nwas the “white counselor.” R. 224, 232. Affidavits from other employees allege\n\nthat Robyn Sunday, the Chief Operating Officer of the clinic, referred to Ms.\n\nNettle as “the big-boobed white Renee” on several occasions. R. 366, 369.\n\nMoreover, affidavits from two employees allege that those who did not appear\n\n“Indian” were treated differently at the Clinic. R. 359, 365. Finally, she alleged\n\nthat child patients at the Clinic, and their parents, would sometimes refer to her as\n\n“white doctor.” R. 237.\n\n      A hostile work environment is one that is “permeated with discriminatory\n\nintimidation, ridicule, and insult, that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter\n\nthe conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” MacKenzie v.

Ms.\n\nNettle testified that at “every staff meeting” in 1993—a decade before she lodged\n\nher complaint with the EEOC—Mr. Hunter made “at least one” racial slur, R. 88,\n\nbut after that she offers no evidence regarding the frequency of his offensive\n\nremarks, other than to say that “‘96 to around 1999 were favorable years for me\n\nin regard to the treatment.” R. 242. Nor does she supply much detail about the\n\ncontent of his comments. It is not even clear that most of Mr. Hunter’s comments\n\nwere directed at her, or at persons of her ethnicity. She describes comments he\n\nmade about Comanches, Cheyennes, and Cherokees, but those are not her tribes. 3\n\nAlthough there is some confusion about this in the record, Ms. Nettle understood\n\nthat Mr. Hunter’s ethnic makeup was similar to her own: both being half\n\n      3\n        Ms. Nettle testified that Mr. Hunter “had said things about the Cherokees,\nsomething about a room full of Cherokees makes like a full blood or something\nlike that.

From her testimony, it does\nnot appear that Mr. Hunter bore any particular animus against Ms. Nettle’s tribe.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fCaucasian, and both affiliated with the Delaware Nation and the Caddo.

We can easily understand\n\nthat it could be annoying and irritating for a person of one racial mix to be\n\nmistaken for another, but there is no precedent for regarding a mistaken racial\n\nidentifier—not employing any epithetical terminology—as opprobrious or\n\nabusive.\n\n      4\n      The dissent focuses on Robyn Sunday’s alleged description of her as “the\nbig-boobed white Renee.” R. 366, 369. But the sting in the comment is its\nsexism, and Ms. Nettle has not complained of sex discrimination.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f      Moreover, as Ms. Nettle concedes, many of the comments were made\n\njokingly. See, e.g., R. 219 (board president “making jest of Cherokees”) 5; id. at\n\n220–21 (Dawn Singleton would “joke” about not going anywhere because she was\n\nnot Indian and had blonde hair and green eyes); id. at 224 (Tracy Mailo would\n\nmake “statements in jest at meetings regarding my skin color”); id. at 226\n\n(explaining that she would interpret comments made “in jest . . . to be in light or\n\nnot wanting to offend as much as in regard to statements being made that are\n\nintended to be disparaging in nature” and stating that “many” of Mr. Hunter’s\n\ncomments “were intended to be in jest”); id. at 229 (offering that she no longer\n\nfound a staff member’s comments offensive because as “the years wore on . . . I\n\nknew she didn’t mean [them] disparagingly”); id. at 241 (“[m]ost times” Mr.\n\nHunter said something about a tribe it was “in jest.”). Where comments are made\n\nin jest and the plaintiff recognizes them as such, unless they are of unusual\n\npervasiveness or severity, they cannot ordinarily be regarded as having “alter[ed]\n\nthe conditions of the victim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” Harris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\n      The dissent merits a reply on three points. First, noting that some of Ms.\n\nNettle’s patients, or the parents of her patients, would call her the “white doctor,”\n\n\n      5\n       The transcript of Ms. Nettle’s testimony spells the word as “gist” rather\nthan “jest.” Because the context makes clear Ms. Nettle was speaking of\n“jesting” behavior, we have altered the transcript. See R. 91 (“Q. What do you\nmean, in gist? A. Just joking . . .”).\n\n                                         -19-\n\fAplt. Br. 37, R. 237–39, the dissent maintains that comments made by patients at\n\nthe Clinic are “relevant to the present inquiry” and that it is not “determinative”\n\nthat “the patients were not employees of the clinic.” Dissent 12. While our\n\nprecedent does not categorically exclude comments made by patients or customers\n\nfrom consideration of a hostile work environment, we believe such claims are of\n\nlittle significance in the context of this case. Ms. Nettle’s patients were children,\n\nand there is no reason to think that their (or their parents’) identification of her as\n\nthe “white doctor” was malicious, intended to be hurtful, or anything other than\n\nmistaken ethnic identification. Ms. Nettle testified that although she went\n\nthrough a stage where it hurt her to be called “white doctor,” and that this would\n\nmake her “angry sometimes,” she “dealt with the children,” who trusted her, and\n\nshe “didn’t find [the comments] as a problem at the very end” because she was so\n\nbusy. R. 237. Moreover, Ms. Nettle presents no evidence that her employer\n\nencouraged her patients to refer to her as the “white doctor,” as opposed to “Ms.\n\nNettle,” only that her co-workers would “hear” patients or their parents calling\n\nher white doctor and “participate in it.” R. 239.\n\n      The dissent cites Lockard v. Pizza Hut, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157240\"><a href=\"/opinion/157240/lockard-v-pizza-hut-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1062</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1073 (10th Cir.\n\n1998) to support its assertion that employers may be held responsible for the\n\nconduct of their customers, but the facts of Lockard are suggestive in defining the\n\nlimitations on the argument. In Lockard, Ms. Lockard had been subjected to\n\ncrude, sexually harassing comments and physically threatening conduct (grabbing\n\n                                          -20-\n\fher hair and breast) from a group of customers. Id. at 1072. When told that she\n\ndid not want to serve the harassing customers, as she had on three previous\n\noccasions, her employer responded that she was “hired to be a waitress” and that\n\nshe needed to go serve them. Id. at 1067, 1074–75. Both the nature of the\n\ncomments and the character of the employer’s actions are obviously far afield\n\nfrom those that confronted Ms. Nettle at the Indian Clinic. We do not believe the\n\nfacts show that Ms. Nettle’s employer “condone[d] or tolerate[d]” a hostile work\n\nenvironment based on the scattered comments of her patients or their parents. Id.\n\nat 1073–74.\n\n      Second, the dissent downplays the fact that many of the relevant comments\n\nwere made in jest. The dissent claims that the “[w]hether a comment is intended\n\nto be insulting or ‘in jest’ is irrelevant to whether there is a steady barrage of\n\nopprobrious comments.” Dissent 6. But the case cited by the dissent holds only\n\nthat comments need not be directed at or intended to be received by the victim to\n\nbe evidence of a hostile work environment. EEOC v. PVNF, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169205\"><a href=\"/opinion/169205/equal-employment-v-pvnf-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798 (10th Cir. 2007). In that case, we held that vulgar e-mail not intended\n\nfor a recipient, but nonetheless intercepted by her, could be evidence of\n\ndiscrimination. This does not mean that the nonmalicious character of comments,\n\nas understood both by the speakers and by the recipient of the messages, is\n\n“irrelevant” to whether they create a “hostile” or abusive work environment.\n\nPVNF does not hold otherwise, and our caselaw supports the point, under\n\n                                          -21-\n\fcircumstances arguably more humiliating than these. See, e.g., Denetclaw v.\n\nThoutt Bros. Concrete Contractors, 287 Fed. App’x 17, 22 (10th Cir. 2008)\n\n(discrimination against Native American who was frequently asked to perform\n\n“rain dances” found not to be severe in part because plaintiff himself\n\n“characterized [the remarks] as joking and kidding”).\n\n      Of course, what is funny to one person may be deeply offensive to another.\n\nWhat the speaker intended by his remark is not dispositive, and racial insults are\n\nnot permissible merely because the speaker regards them as humorous. But Ms.\n\nNettle herself says that she interpreted many of the comments made by Mr.\n\nHunter and others as joking, and not disparaging, because she knew they were not\n\nintended to offend. See R. 240 (calling the years 1996–1999 as “good years” in\n\nwhich Mr. Hunter did not say anything “directly in regard to [Ms. Nettle] other\n\nthan in jest.”); id. at 241 (distinguishing between comments that were “in jest”\n\nand those that were “disparaging”). When evaluating the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, we cannot disregard the distinction between jesting and insulting.\n\n      Third, the dissent takes us to task for failing to consider the fact that Ms.\n\nNettle was not selected to represent the Clinic at certain events in our analysis of\n\nthe “totality of circumstances” analysis in the previous section. Dissent 13–14.\n\nIn her testimony, Ms. Nettle pointed to not being allowed to attend the Heritage\n\nCelebration at the state capitol and a Oklahoma University Health Sciences\n\nCenter event, allegedly because as a light-skinned Native American, she did not\n\n                                         -22-\n\f“represent” Native Americans well. R. 264; see also R. 362. We disagree that\n\nnot being able to attend two events which, as we note in the following section,\n\nwere only at best a discretionary part of her job, amounts to discrimination that is\n\n“severe.” Nor does the fact of being prevented from attending two events from a\n\nmany-year career show that Ms. Nettle experienced “pervasive” discrimination\n\nduring her employment at the Clinic.\n\n      From the record, we can see that at many points during her employment,\n\nthe Clinic was not a pleasant place for Ms. Nettle to work. People said crude\n\nthings, pet projects were taken away from her, and she was made to feel singled\n\nout because of her Caucasian appearance. But Title VII’s standard for redress is a\n\nhostile work environment, not an unpleasant one. See, e.g., Duncan v. Manager,\n\nDept. of Safety, City & County of Denver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165546\"><a href=\"/opinion/165546/duncan-v-manager-dept-safety/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1313–14 (10th Cir.\n\n2005) (Title VII provides no remedy for boorish behavior or bad taste); Sprague\n\nv.

Incidents spread\n\nout over many years, and which indicate mostly poor taste and lack of\n\nprofessionalism, do not rise to the level of a hostile work environment. See, e.g.,\n\nPenry v. Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156894\"><a href=\"/opinion/156894/penry-v-federal-home-loan/\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1263 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). With all due respect to the dissent, we believe that the dissent’s standard\n\nfor pervasiveness and severity falls short of what this court and the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n                                         -23-\n\fCourt have set forth, and would make a broad swath of American workplaces\n\nsubject to liability under Title VII.\n\n      We therefore affirm the district court’s ruling that the Indian Clinic is\n\nentitled to summary judgment on Ms. Nettle’s hostile work environment claim.\n\n      B. Adverse Employment Action\n\n      Under Title VII, an employer may not “discriminate against any individual\n\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\n\nbecause of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). In order to show discrimination Ms. Nettle must\n\nestablish that (1) she is the member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an\n\nadverse employment action; (3) she was qualified for the position at issue; and (4)\n\nshe was treated less favorably than others not in the protected class. Piercy v.\n\nMaketa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168971\"><a href=\"/opinion/168971/piercy-v-maketa/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1203 (10th Cir. 2007). The Clinic does not dispute that\n\nMs. Nettle is in a protected class, which she has “described as ‘light-skinned\n\nNative Americans.’” Dist. Ct. Op. 16. The district court, however, agreed with\n\nthe Clinic that Ms. Nettle failed to make the necessary primary showing that she\n\nhad suffered an adverse employment action. Id. at 18.\n\n      Ms. Nettle concedes that in the period identified in her first EEOC\n\ncharge—March 10, 2004 to October 20, 2004—she “did not lose any salary nor\n\nreceive an official demotion” but that nonetheless “the evidence shows that the\n\nterms and conditions of her employment were altered.” Aplt. Br. 38–39. Ms.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fNettle points to the removal of Thanksgiving and Christmas Drives from her job\n\nfunctions (programs which she had started); her relocation to a new office; not\n\nbeing allowed to set up a booth at the Oklahoma University Health Sciences\n\nCenter; and being pulled from attending Native American Heritage week at the\n\nstate capital, among other things. R. 168–69, 362. It is not evident from the\n\nrecord that the removal of the Thanksgiving and Christmas programs occurred\n\nwithin the time period in which Ms. Nettle alleged discrimination, but even if it\n\ndid, we do not see any of the events cited by Ms. Nettle affecting her terms and\n\nconditions of employment. Although we take a “case by case approach,” and do\n\nnot limit ourselves to finding monetary loses or loss of benefits to constitute an\n\nadverse action, the action must rise above the level of “a mere inconvenience or\n\nan alteration of job responsibilities.” Sanchez v. Denver Pub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157338\"><a href=\"/opinion/157338/sanchez-v-denver-public/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n532 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Ms. Nettle’s job description included a clause that said she would be\n\nrequired to “perform[] other duties as assigned.” R. 205, 404. She said in her\n\ndeposition that she considered the Thanksgiving and Christmas drives to be part\n\nof the assigned duties. R. 206. But there is no inconsistency with the job\n\ndescription that some duties, once assigned, should later be unassigned as\n\nnecessary. Moreover, the various additional duties she was given do not reach the\n\ncore of the description of her position as “Native American Youth Specialist”: “to\n\nprovide Health Promotion/Disease Prevention services directed towards American\n\n                                         -25-\n\fIndian youth for the Community Services Department.” R. 403. The fact that\n\nMs. Nettle was prevented from attending some external events does not represent\n\na significant change in her employment status. See Piercy, 480 F.3d at 1203\n\n(adverse employment action includes “significant change in employment status,\n\nsuch as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different\n\nresponsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.” (citation\n\nomitted)).\n\n      Because we hold that Ms. Nettle did not suffer an adverse employment\n\naction, we do not reach the other steps in the test for showing discrimination.\n\n                       IV. National Origin Discrimination\n\n      Ms. Nettle finally argues that she should be able to make a claim for\n\nnational origin discrimination, even though she did not check off “national\n\norigin” on her first EEOC charge. The “particulars” of the charge stated that Ms.\n\nNettle and other employees were “being treated differently because of [their] tribe\n\nor skin color.” R. 18 (emphasis added). She also alleged in the particulars that\n\nduring meetings, Mr. Hunter would “make comments about different tribes.” Id.\n\n(emphasis added). The district court found that because Ms. Nettle did not\n\n“identify national origin as a basis for discrimination in her EEOC” charge (by\n\nnot checking the box), she had not administratively exhausted her claim.\n\nAccordingly, it did not permit Ms. Nettle “to expand the scope of [her] lawsuit\n\nand include at this late date” a national origin claim. Dist. Ct. Op. 24.\n\n                                         -26-\n\f      The Ninth Circuit, in a case cited by Ms. Nettle, held that discrimination\n\nagainst an Indian tribe could give rise to a national origin claim under Title VII,\n\nbecause Indian tribes could be “considered nations.” Dawavendewa v. Salt River\n\nProject Agr. Imp. & Power Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757704\"><a href=\"/opinion/757704/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1312-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45500-98-daily/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1120 (9th Cir. 1998) (different\n\nIndian tribes “were at one time considered nations, and indeed still are to a\n\ncertain extent”). The Clinic does not challenge the very idea of national origin\n\ndiscrimination based on membership in a tribe in its brief before us, so we assume\n\nwithout holding that one can bring a legitimate claim of national origin\n\ndiscrimination based on discrimination against one’s tribe.\n\n      We must therefore consider whether Ms. Nettle can be said to have made\n\nsuch a claim in her original charge. To “effectuate the remedial purposes of Title\n\nVII,” courts are to liberally construe charges filed with the EEOC. Harrell v.\n\nSpangler, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1581475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1581475/harrell-v-spangler-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1219 (D. Kan. 1997). Accordingly, “the\n\ncrucial inquiry is whether the claims set forth in the civil complaint fall within the\n\nscope of the investigation that could reasonably be expected to grow out of the\n\nEEOC charges.” Id. Although Ms. Nettle did not check the box for national\n\norigin in her charge, she did state, in the particulars, that she believed she was\n\nbeing discriminated against because of her tribe. Moreover, in her complaint, Ms.\n\nNettle explained that Mr. Hunter “made statements regarding the Delaware Tribe .\n\n. . as being want-to-be’s which indicates Plaintiff wants to pretend and be like\n\nIndians of browner skin.” R. 26. Mr. Hunter, the complaint continued, “also\n\n                                         -27-\n\fmade statements regarding Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribal employees, Comanche\n\nemployees, Cherokee and Choctaw Tribal employees.” Id.\n\n      It seems clear from the charge that Ms. Nettle was alleging national origin\n\ndiscrimination, and that it provided adequate notice to the Clinic. See Stephens v.\n\nCity of Topeka </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519080\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519080/stephens-v-city-of-topeka-kan/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950 (D. Kan 1999). In Stephens, the plaintiff\n\ndid not check the box “race” on his charge, and wrote in his charge that “I believe\n\nI was treated differently because of my National Origin and my age, because\n\nyounger, white managers/employees . . . were treated differently.” Id. The\n\ndistrict court held that because Mr. Stephens said he was treated differently from\n\nother “white” employees, this suggested he was (also) making an allegation of\n\nracial discrimination. Id. In this case, as well, Ms. Nettle made claims in her\n\ncharge related to Mr. Hunter’s comments about various other tribes, claims which\n\nrelate to Ms. Nettle’s national origin.\n\n      In her Complaint in district court, however, Ms. Nettle did not allege\n\ndiscrimination based on tribe or national origin. Her Complaint alleged\n\ndiscrimination “on account of race and color” alone. Only in her reply to the\n\nClinic’s motion for summary judgement did Ms. Nettle drop her claim of race\n\ndiscrimination only to ask to be “allowed to maintain a cause of action for\n\nnational origin discrimination.” R. 191.\n\n      As noted above, plaintiffs are confined to the claims they timely raise in\n\ntheir complaint. A plaintiff “may not amend her complaint through allegations\n\n                                          -28-\n\fmade in response to a motion for summary judgment.” Griffen v. Potter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784927\"><a href=\"/opinion/784927/doris-g-griffin-v-john-e-potter-postmaster-general-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (7th Cir. 2004). Here, concerns about proper notice come to the fore.\n\nIndeed, part of the Clinic’s strategy in its motion for summary judgment was to\n\nconcede that Mr. Hunter had made comments about Ms. Nettle’s tribal affiliation,\n\nbut to argue that statements about tribal affiliation could not support a claim for\n\nrace or color discrimination, which is what Ms. Nettle alleged. R. 59. It hardly\n\nseems fair that Ms. Nettle in reply, could argue that—all along—she was really\n\nalleging national origin discrimination, and that she should be allowed to proceed\n\non those grounds, rather than the grounds which she presented in her Complaint.\n\nWhile Ms. Nettle’s charge could be read as encompassing a national origin\n\ndiscrimination claim, the same cannot be said of her Complaint.\n\n      Even if we were to read Ms. Nettle’s Complaint to encompass national\n\norigin discrimination, we doubt that it could withstand a motion for summary\n\njudgment. Ms. Nettle’s specific (i.e., not vague) race and national origin claims\n\nappear to rely on much the same information we have already considered in\n\nconnection with her claim for color discrimination (for example, that some tribes\n\nhad lighter skin color than other tribes, R. 12). We have already concluded that\n\nthis evidence was insufficient to survive summary judgment. Unless Ms. Nettle\n\nhas other facts, which she did not put forward even in her reply to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment, then the facts pertaining only to national origin\n\ndiscrimination make up a smaller set of the available facts pointing to\n\n                                         -29-\n\fdiscrimination of any kind. If she did not survive summary judgment on the\n\nlarger set of facts, a fortiori, she could not survive it with the smaller set.\n\n                                    V. Conclusion\n\n      We AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n                                                  Entered for the Court\n\n\n\n                                                  Michael W.

Indian Health Council\n\nBRISCOE, J., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n         I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part. With one exception, I\n\nagree with the majority. Regarding the hostile work environment claim, I read\n\nthe majority’s opinion to improperly consider witness credibility, improperly\n\nweigh evidence, and omit meaningful analysis of the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding Nettle’s allegations. Accordingly, I would reverse the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment for the Clinic on Nettle’s hostile work environment\n\nclaim.\n\n         To affirm the district court’s grant of summary judgment on Nettle’s hostile\n\nwork environment claim, the majority begins by quoting the standard elements of\n\nsuch a claim—a plaintiff must show that a rational jury could find that the\n\nworkplace was “permeate[d] . . . with ‘discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s\n\nemployment and create an abusive working environment.’” Maj.

While I disagree with the majority\n\nopinion’s reasoning for these individual categories, I am more troubled by the\n\nmajority’s parsing of Nettle’s allegations. “[O]ur hostile environment cases\n\fconsistently have emphasized the need for the district court to examine the\n\ntotality of the circumstances when reviewing a summary judgment motion.\n\nIndeed, the very term ‘environment’ indicates that allegedly discriminatory\n\nincidents should not be examined in isolation.” Penry v.

Divided Allegations\n\nA.     “Vague” Allegations\n\n       The majority reviews the district court’s three-pronged reasoning for\n\ngranting summary judgment. Two of the identified reasons relate to the\n\nspecificity of Nettle’s allegations. E.g., Maj. Op. at 13 (“[S]he has not described\n\nthe exact nature of many of the comments,” and “she cannot recall with any\n\nspecificity the dates when many . . . comments were made.”). 1 The third reason\n\nisolates Nettle’s concession that portions of her employment “were good years.”\n\nId. 2 The majority agrees with the district court’s assessment of Nettle’s\n\n       1\n           Unless otherwise specified, I omit the majority’s quotation of the district court\nopinion.\n       2\n         Nettle was employed with the Clinic for “thirteen[]year[s],” ending in 2004.\nMaj. Op. at 12. Nettle conceded that “[19]96 . . . until [19]99 were good years.” Id. at\n13. The majority opinion makes much of this concession, “not[ing] . . . that Ms. Nettle\nwas employed by the Clinic for over a decade, and that she conceded that she was\ntreated favorably for a significant portion of that time, from 1996 to ‘around 1999.’”\nId. at 16.\n        The majority opinion’s reliance on this time period raises two concerns. First, a\nreasonable inference would be that the last five years of Nettle’s employment were\nnot good years. If three years constitutes a “significant portion” of Nettle’s tenure with\nthe Clinic, then a more recent five years is a more consequential quantity of her\n                                                                             (continued...)\n\n                                              -2-\n\fallegations. Id. at 13 (“The[] [allegations in Nettle’s appellate brief] suffer from\n\nmany of the problems that the district court identified in its opinion.”). The\n\nmajority affirms the grant of summary judgment for this category of Nettle’s\n\nallegations—“that Mr. Hunter [the Chief Executive Officer at the Clinic] would\n\nmake ‘frequent’ racial comments at staff meetings and was generally ‘negative,’\n\nas well as the statements by her co-workers that there was discrimination at the\n\n[C]linic”—by applying the standard that “[v]ague, conclusory statements do not\n\nsuffice to create a genuine issue of material fact.” Id. at 16–17. The majority\n\nopinion also discounts Nettle’s allegations regarding Hunter’s comments by\n\nconcluding, “It cannot be assumed that all of his comments about different tribes,\n\nand about those whose skin is lighter or darker than others, related to her.” Id. at\n\n17 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n      In my view, this reasoning improperly weighs the credibility of Nettle’s\n\nsubmitted evidence and labels comments as “vague and conclusory” when they\n\nare not.

Second, I fail to understand how this concession negates her hostile work\nenvironment claim. The central analysis should be the totality of the circumstances\nsurrounding Nettle’s employment. Penry, 155 F.3d at 1262 (“‘A play cannot be\nunderstood on the basis of some of its scenes but only on its entire performance, and\nsimilarly, a discrimination analysis must concentrate not on individual incidents [or\nperiods], but on the overall scenario.’”) (quoting Andrews v.

Op. at 2.\n\nThere is no dispute that Nettle was a light-skinned Native American, and that\n\nHunter allegedly targeted her for ridicule because of her skin color, including\n\ncomments regarding the Delaware Tribe such as “they want to pretend and be like\n\nIndians of browner skin.” R. 12; R. 154.\n\n      The majority also acknowledges that Nettle alleges that “in 1993 in all staff\n\nmeetings, there would always be at least one discriminatory or racial slur against\n\ndifferent tribal affiliations or lighter-skinned people and from 1993 to her\n\ntermination date [in 2004] there were statements of discrimination by Mr.\n\nHunter,” but the majority characterizes this allegation as “vague.” Maj. Op. at 14\n\n(quotations and alterations omitted). While I concede that the cited statement\n\ncould benefit from more specificity, portions of the statement do not equivocate\n\non the key proofs: frequency, location, content, and target of the alleged offensive\n\ncomments. Nettle’s statement is based on personal knowledge. With the\n\nspecifics she has set forth, she has presented more than a “bald assertion” that she\n\nsuffered from a hostile work environment. Moreover, because Nettle’s statement\n\ndoes not draw any improper inference or implicit conclusion, I do not consider the\n\nstatement to be conclusory.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      I also disagree with the majority’s assertion that “[i]t cannot be assumed\n\nthat all of [Mr. Hunter’s] comments about different tribes, and about those whose\n\nskin is lighter or darker than others, related to [Nettle].” Maj.

Here, Nettle is the non-moving party. If Nettle’s\n\nallegations are true, which must be assumed at this stage, then this evidence\n\nwould support her hostile work environment claim because it demonstrates a\n\nworkplace “permeate[d] . . . with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and\n\ninsult.” Tademy, 520 F.3d at 1156 (internal quotation omitted). It should be the\n\nrole of a fact finder in this case, and not the district court on summary judgment,\n\nto determine whether the alleged comments made to and about Nettle altered the\n\nconditions of her employment.\n\nB.    “Comments made in jest”\n\n      The majority also discredits portions of Nettle’s allegations as comments\n\nmade only in jest. Maj. Op. at 19, 21–22. The majority highlights that “as Ms.\n\nNettle concedes, many of the comments were made jokingly.” Id. at 19 (listing\n\nrecord citations where Nettle identifies comments as being made “in jest”).\n\nIndeed, the majority notes that in certain circumstances Nettle “no longer found a\n\nstaff member’s comments offensive because as the years wore on [Nettle] knew\n\nshe didn’t mean them disparagingly.” Id. at 19 (quotation and alterations\n\n                                          -5-\n\fomitted). Although the majority acknowledges that “what is funny to one person\n\nmay be deeply offensive to another,” the majority proclaims that “we cannot\n\ndisregard the distinction between jesting and insulting.” Id. at 22. Accordingly,\n\nthe majority determines that Nettle’s allegations of comments made “in jest” are\n\ninsufficient to create an abusive working environment, stating “where comments\n\nare made in jest and the plaintiff recognizes them as such, unless they are of\n\nunusual pervasiveness or severity, they cannot ordinarily be regarded as having\n\n‘alter[ed] the conditions of the victim’s employment and create[d] an abusive\n\nworking environment.” Id. at 19 (citing Harris v.

Whether a comment is\n\nintended to be insulting or “in jest” is irrelevant to whether there is a steady\n\nbarrage of opprobrious comments. See EEOC v. PVNF, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169205\"><a href=\"/opinion/169205/equal-employment-v-pvnf-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n798 (10th Cir. 2007) (“We have never held, nor would we, that to be subjected to\n\na hostile work environment the discriminatory conduct must be both directed at\n\nthe victim and intended to be received by the victim.”). The analysis for whether\n\na statement contributed to a hostile work environment is whether the “victim\n\nherself perceived the environment to be abusive” and whether the statement was\n\n“so severe or pervasive that an objectively reasonable person would find it\n\nabusive or hostile.” Williams v. W.D. Sports, N.M., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169592\"><a href=\"/opinion/169592/williams-v-wd-sports-nm-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (citing Harris, 510 U.S. at 21). Thus, statements intended to be\n\n                                          -6-\n\f“in jest” can still be opprobrious if they are subjectively and objectively severe or\n\npervasive. No analysis of the “jester’s” intent is necessary.\n\n      The majority responds that “[t]his does not mean that the nonmalicious\n\ncharacter of comments, as understood both by the speakers and by the recipient of\n\nthe messages, is ‘irrelevant’ to whether they create a ‘hostile’ or abusive work\n\nenvironment.” Maj. Op. at 21. I agree with a portion of this statement. If the\n\nrecipient of the messages finds the comments to be nonmalicious, the comment\n\nfails the subjective portion of the analysis. In that context, the statements made\n\n“in jest” would not contribute to a hostile work environment. Conversely,\n\nstatements that only the speaker considers nonmalicious—but the recipient\n\nconsiders offensive—could contribute to a hostile work environment if they are\n\nobjectively severe or pervasive.\n\n      The majority overlooks this distinction. The majority relies on Nettle’s\n\nstatement that some of the statements were made in jest and that she did not find\n\ncertain, but not all, comments “disparaging[] because she knew they were not\n\nintended to offend,” id. at 23, as license for the majority to disregard all\n\ncomments made “in jest.” Simply because Nettle identified comments as “in jest”\n\ndoes not mean that the comments were not subjectively and objectively severe or\n\npervasive. Moreover, Nettle’s ability to distinguish offensive comments from\n\ncomments received “in jest” and considered to be nonmalicious arguably lends\n\ncredence to her allegations of frequent racial comments that were not received “in\n\n                                          -7-\n\fjest.” Thus, the majority’s conclusion—“where comments are made in jest and\n\nthe plaintiff recognizes them as such,” these identified comments cannot support a\n\nhostile work environment claim—is not universally applicable to all comments\n\nmade “in jest.” Id. at 19. Because the majority makes no effort to distinguish\n\nbetween comments made “in jest” that Nettle considered offensive and comments\n\nmade “in jest” that Nettle considered nonmalicious, the majority’s assertion that\n\n“we cannot disregard the distinction between jesting and insulting” is specious.\n\nId. at 23.\n\n       In addition to blurring the subjective and objective analysis, the majority’s\n\ndiscussion of comments made “in jest” also subtly raises the threshold for hostile\n\nwork environment claims to be actionable. The majority notes that comments\n\nmade in jest cannot “be regarded as having ‘alter[ed] the conditions of the\n\nvictim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working environment,” “unless\n\nthey are of unusual pervasiveness or severity.” Id. at 19 (citing Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 22) (emphasis added). First, although the defendant in Harris “claimed he was\n\nonly joking,” the analysis of Harris does not address or distinguish comments\n\nmade in jest. Harris, 510 U.S. at 19. Second, Harris notes that “Title VII is\n\nviolated” when the discriminatory comments are “sufficiently severe or pervasive\n\nto alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and create an abusive working\n\nenvironment.” Id. at 21 (emphasis added). I consider the majority’s “unusually”\n\nsevere or pervasive standard to create a higher threshold of proof for Nettle than\n\n                                          -8-\n\fthe accepted “sufficiently” severe or pervasive standard. Consequently, the\n\nmajority cites Harris, but heightens the standard Harris set forth. Harris,\n\nhowever, clarifies that the “severe or pervasive” standard is the baseline for\n\nactionable hostile work environment claims and rejects a more stringent standard.\n\nHarris, 510 U.S. at 22.\n\nC.     Specific Allegations\n\n       On the other hand, the majority admits that “[s]ome of this vagueness is\n\ninconsequential.” Maj. Op. at 14. The majority then lists some “specific\n\nremarks”: (1) “Mr. Hunter commented that Ms[.] Nettle ‘thinks she’s Indian, but\n\nwe wonder. We have been trying to get rid of her since the day we hired her,”\n\nid.; (2) “Mr. Hunter also said . . . that people who did not look Indian ‘don’t\n\nrepresent the Indian community well,’” id.; (3) “Daren Paddyaker[] remark[ed]\n\nthat Ms. Nettle was a ‘wannabe Indian,’” id. at 15; (4) “Dawn Singleton[]\n\ncomment[ed] that [Nettle] was the ‘white counselor,’” id.; (5) “Robyn Sunday, the\n\nChief Operating Officer of the [C]linic, referred to Ms. Nettle as ‘the big-boobed\n\nwhite Renee’ on several occasions,” 3 id.; (6) “[T]wo employees allege that those\n\nwho did not appear ‘Indian’ were treated differently at the Clinic,” id.; and (7)\n\n\n\n       3\n         The majority chides the dissent for “focus[ing]” on this alleged description and\nconsiders the “sting in the comment [to be] its sexism.” Maj. Op. at 18 n.4. This\ncriticism by the majority for “focus[ing]” on Sunday’s description is puzzling as this\nreference to the description, which quotes the majority opinion, is the only reference to\nthe full description. Further, by finding “sting” in only the sexist portion of the remark,\nthe majority disregards entirely the “white Renee” portion of the description.\n\n                                            -9-\n\f“[C]hild patients at the Clinic, and their parents, would sometimes refer to her as\n\n‘white doctor,’” id. The majority affirms the grant of summary judgment for\n\nthese specific allegations because they “constitute ‘sporadic . . . slurs’ rather than\n\na ‘steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments.’” 4 Id. at 16 (quoting Bolden v.\n\nPRC Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 551 (10th Cir. 1994)). The majority opinion also reduces\n\nmany of these allegations to “simply identify[ing] her as ‘white’” and concludes\n\nthat “it could be annoying and irritating for a person of one racial mix to be\n\nmistaken for another, but there is no precedent for regarding a mistaken racial\n\nidentifier . . . as opprobrious or abusive.” Id. at 18.\n\n      By quoting the “steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments” language,\n\nthe majority disregards several aspects of Nettle’s allegations and Tenth Circuit\n\nprecedent. Some of Nettle’s allegations involve more than comments; Nettle also\n\nalleged discriminatory conduct. Some of Nettle’s allegations include a steady\n\nbarrage of comments; Nettle also alleged that at “staff meetings, there would\n\n\n\n      4\n        The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that “[f]or . . . harassment to be\nactionable, it must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [the\nvictim’s] employment and create an abusive working environment.” Meritor Sav.

Arguably, by requiring a “steady barrage” and “opprobrious\ncomments,” this application has improperly converted a disjunctive analysis, “severe or\npervasive,” into a conjunctive analysis, requiring “severe and pervasive.”\n\n                                          -10-\n\falways be at least one discriminatory or racial slur against different tribal\n\naffiliations or lighter-skinned people.” Maj. Op. at 14 (internal quotation\n\nomitted). Similarly, given that three of the listed seven specific allegations\n\ninclude ongoing conduct—Sunday’s insulting description of Nettle being made\n\n“on several occasions,” that “those who did not appear ‘Indian’ were treated\n\ndifferently at the Clinic,” and that Clinic patients and their parents “would\n\nsometimes refer to her as ‘white doctor’”—there is no basis for the majority’s\n\ndescription of the conduct targeting Nettle as “sporadic” in nature.\n\n      There is also no basis to support the majority opinion’s conclusion\n\nregarding racial misidentification. It is unclear how the majority opinion could\n\nfind only mistaken racial identity in such comments as, “Nettle thinks she’s\n\nIndian, but we wonder” or “wannabe Indian.” Id. at 14–15. To the contrary, in\n\nthis context it is clear that the description “white Renee” is likely not an example\n\nof mistaken racial identity. To me, affirming a grant of summary judgment on\n\ndiscriminatory comments regarding a person’s skin color merits more precise\n\nanalysis because words and epithets regarding a person’s race and color can be\n\n“intensely degrading.” See PVNF, 487 F.3d at 799 (quoting Winsor v.

Patient Statements\n\n       Nettle alleges that “the patients [of the Clinic] would call her the ‘white\n\ndoctor.’” Aplt. Br. at 37; R. 183, 234. The majority opinion “believe[s] such\n\nclaims are of little significance in the context of this case,” because “Nettle\n\npresents no evidence that her employer encouraged her patients to refer to her as\n\nthe ‘white doctor . . . .’” Id. at 20.\n\n       Because comments made by the patients and their parents are part of\n\nNettle’s workplace environment, they are relevant to the present inquiry. That the\n\npatients and their parents were not employees of the Clinic is not determinative.\n\nThe Clinic may be held responsible for comments by its patients and their parents\n\nbecause there is evidence that they should have known about such comments.

Accepting Nettle’s\n\nallegations as true, if the Clinic introduced Nettle as “white,” it should expect its\n\npatients and their parents to follow suit and refer to Nettle as “white.” By this\n\n                                          -12-\n\fconduct—although it is not clear that the threshold standard requires Nettle to\n\npresent such evidence—the Clinic arguably has “encouraged” the patients and\n\ntheir parents to refer to Nettle as “white.”\n\nE.    Removed Employment Duties\n\n      While the majority lists the allegation that “Mr. Hunter said . . . that\n\npeople who did not look Indian ‘don’t represent the Indian community well,’”\n\nMaj. Op. at 14, Nettle also alleges that she was prevented from representing the\n\nClinic at certain events because she did not “look Indian.” Aplt. Br. at 37; R.\n\n168, 246. With little analysis, the majority opinion brushes these allegations\n\naside as being not severe or pervasive. Maj. Op. at 23 (“We disagree that not\n\nbeing able to attend two events which, . . . were only at best a discretionary part\n\nof her job, amounts to discrimination that is ‘severe.’ Nor does the fact of being\n\nprevented from attending two events from a many-year career show that Ms.\n\nNettle experienced ‘pervasive’ discrimination during her employment at the\n\nClinic.”).\n\n      Although the majority would discount this evidence, I consider Nettle’s\n\nallegations that she was prevented from representing the Clinic in the community\n\nbecause she did not “look Indian” to be relevant to and give weight to her hostile\n\nwork environment claim. These allegations, if assumed to be true, are indicative\n\nof a workplace where Nettle’s skin color impacted her employment status with\n\nher employer, her co-workers, and the community the Clinic served. Further,\n\n                                          -13-\n\fthese allegations contradict other portions of the majority’s reasoning. The\n\nmajority dismisses all of Nettle’s specific allegations as sporadic or infrequent\n\n“comments.” Prohibiting Nettle from representing the Clinic because of her skin\n\ncolor is not a comment; it is an action that directly affects Nettle’s work\n\nresponsibilities, performance, and status. Only examining whether this alleged\n\nconduct was by itself “severe” or “pervasive” disregards the impact of the\n\nconduct in the coherent analysis of whether her workplace environment was\n\n“permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment.”\n\nMcCowan v.

The Totality of the Circumstances\n\n      In my view, the most problematic aspect of the majority’s divide-and-\n\nconquer analysis is that it does not consider Nettle’s allegations in the context of\n\nthe totality of the circumstances. We have rejected this approach. See PVNF,\n\n487 F.3d at 799 (“By parsing out the various instances of harassment and\n\ncharacterizing them as gender-neutral, or not pervasive, [the employer] seeks to\n\neschew the proper totality of the circumstances test, which is the touchstone of\n\nour analysis of hostile work environment claims.” (quotation omitted)).\n\n                                         -14-\n\fMoreover, any totality of the circumstances analysis should be considered “‘from\n\nthe perspective of a reasonable person in [Nettle’s] position.’” McCowan, 273\n\nF.3d at 923 (quoting Oncale v.

Instead, the\n\nmajority parses and dismisses allegations of discriminatory conduct without\n\nregard to Nettle’s circumstances. E.g., Maj. Op. at 16 (“Nettle’s allegations of\n\nidentifiable discriminatory or harassing conduct constitute ‘sporadic . . . slurs’\n\nrather than a ‘steady barrage of opprobrious . . . comments.”); id. (“Nettle’s\n\nclaims that Mr. Hunter would make ‘frequent’ racial comments at staff meetings\n\nand was generally ‘negative,’ as well as the statements by her co-workers that\n\nthere was discrimination at the clinic, do not rise to the level of creating a\n\ngenuine dispute.”); id. at 19 (“Where comments are made in jest and the plaintiff\n\nrecognizes them as such, unless they are of unusual pervasiveness or severity,\n\nthey cannot ordinarily be regarded as having ‘alter[ed] the conditions of the\n\nvictim’s employment and create[d] an abusive working environment.’”); id. at 21\n\n(“We do not believe the facts show that Ms. Nettle’s employer ‘condone[d] or\n\ntolderate[d]’ a hostile work environment based on the scattered comments of her\n\npatients and their parents.”); id. at 23 (“We disagree that not being able to attend\n\ntwo events which, . . . were only at best a discretionary part of her job, amounts\n\n                                          -15-\n\fto discrimination that is ‘severe’ [or pervasive].”). By segregating subsets of\n\nallegations and then analyzing each subset in isolation, the majority fails to\n\nconsider the totality of the circumstances when addressing Nettle’s hostile work\n\nenvironment claim. See McCowan, 273 F.3d at 925 (suggesting that even conduct\n\nthat is not explicitly discriminatory may still form a part of the totality of the\n\ncircumstances).\n\n      The majority’s sole effort to put all of these allegations together in context\n\nacknowledges that, “the Clinic was not a pleasant place for Ms. Nettle to work.\n\nPeople said crude things, pet projects were taken away from her, and she was\n\nmade to feel singled out because of her Caucasian appearance.” Maj. Op. at 23.\n\nThe majority, however, concludes that “Title VII’s standard for redress is a\n\nhostile work environment, not an unpleasant one,” stating that Title VII does not\n\nremedy boorish, unpleasant conduct and bad taste. Id.\n\n      By this reasoning, the majority either improperly weighs evidence or\n\nreduces hostile work environment claims to semantics. It is axiomatic that at the\n\nsummary judgment stage, “it is not our province . . . to weigh the evidence . . . .”\n\nSanders, 544 F.3d at 1105–06. In the context of hostile work environment claims,\n\nthis prohibition against weighing evidence gains significance as we have noted\n\nthat the “severity and pervasiveness evaluation is particularly unsuited for\n\nsummary judgment because it is quintessentially a question of fact.” Herrera, 474\n\nF.3d at 680 (quotation omitted).\n\n                                          -16-\n\f      Based on these precedents, I cannot agree with the majority’s\n\ncharacterization of Nettle’s workplace as merely “unpleasant” and not “hostile.”\n\nNettle does not allege simply boorish conduct or behavior in bad taste. She\n\nalleges conduct that “singled [her] out because of her Caucasian appearance,”\n\nMaj. Op. at 23, including frequent racially-based comments, jokes, and decisions\n\nthat impacted her job duties. The majority offers no explanation for why Nettle’s\n\nsubjective view of her workplace is objectively insufficient to support her hostile\n\nwork environment claim.\n\n      In the final analysis, I would conclude that Nettle’s allegations, taken as a\n\nwhole, are sufficient to create a question of fact as to whether her workplace was\n\n“permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is\n\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [her] employment.”\n\nMcCowan, 273 F.3d at 923. I would reverse the district court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment on Nettle’s hostile work environment claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\f</pre>",
