RULE 2.16\n\n      The underlying question in this case is whether Rule 2.16 requires\n\n“Disciplinary Proceedings” to be kept confidential from complainants. It does not,\n\nand because it does not, there is no authority for the CDC to deny Doe’s request for\n\na copy of its recommendation to the SDP.\n\n      The express language of Rule 2.16 does not contemplate excluding\n\ncomplainants. In relevant part, Rule 2.16 states, “[a]ll members and staff of the\n\nOffice of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Board of Disciplinary Appeals, Committees,\n\nand Commission shall maintain as confidential all Disciplinary Proceedings and\n\nassociated records . . . .” TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.16. Rule 2.16 omits any\n\nlanguage requiring Disciplinary Proceedings to be kept confidential from the\n\ncomplainant, the very person who started the proceedings in the first place.\n\n      Furthermore, the Texas Government Code expressly allows the complainant\n\nto be physically present at some “Disciplinary Proceedings,” including Evidentiary\n\nPanel proceedings. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 81.072(b)(10); see TEX. R.\n\nDISCIPLINARY P. 1.06L (defining “Disciplinary Proceedings” to include the\n\nproceeding before an Evidentiary Panel); see also TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.16.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                             1\n\f      The CDC’s interpretation of Rule 2.16, as requiring “Disciplinary\n\nProceedings” to remain confidential from the complainant, cannot stand. This is\n\nparticularly evident because Disciplinary Proceedings include Evidentiary Panel\n\nproceedings, before which the complainant has an express right to appear.\n\nBecause Rule 2.16 does not apply to complainants, this Court should reverse the\n\ntrial court’s dismissal and remand this case for rulings on the substantive issues\n\npresented in Doe’s pleadings.\n\nII.   SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR DOE’S CLAIMS\n\n      Appellees assert that neither exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity\n\napplies. See APPELLEE’S BRIEF at **20–24. First, Appellees claim that Doe did\n\nnot challenge Rule 2.16’s validity. Id. at **20–22. Then, appellees claim that the\n\nultra vires exception does not apply because Doe seeks to compel a government\n\nofficial to affirmatively perform a discretionary act. Id. at **22–24.\n\n      A.     Appellees cannot validly apply Rule 2.16 to Doe\n\n      Despite Appellees’ characterizations of Doe’s arguments, the issue Doe\n\nraises is whether Rule 2.16 can be applied to him, not how Rule 2.16 is applied.\n\nSee APPELLEES’ BRIEF at **20–21. In his live pleading, and on appeal, Doe\n\ncontends that Rule 2.16 does not apply to complainants, including himself. See,\n\ne.g., infra I. As the complainant, Doe is a participant in the proceedings, not\n\nmerely an uninvolved member of the public, so Rule 2.16 does not apply to him.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                              2\n\fSee TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 81.072(b)(10); TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 1.06L, 2.16.\n\nBecause Rule 2.16 does not apply to Doe, the trial court erred in dismissing the\n\ncase on this ground.\n\n       B.    Doe properly asserts an ultra vires claim against the CDC\n\n       Doe’s claim is a proper ultra vires claim. He alleges that Linda Acevedo,\n\nthe CDC, denied him a copy of the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP, without\n\nlegal authority to do so. That is the very nature of an ultra vires claim: a\n\ngovernmental official takes an action that it lacked authority to take. See, e.g., City\n\nof El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009). Because Rule 2.16 did\n\nnot authorize Linda Acevedo to take the action she did (withhold from Doe a copy\n\nof the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP), she acted ultra vires, and the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\nIII.   STATUTORY IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR DOE’S CLAIMS\n\n       Appellees argue that Rule 15.09 blankets them with immunity. APPELLEES’\n\nBRIEF at **24–26. However, Rule 15.09 applies only to (1) individuals who are\n\n(2) acting in the course of their official duties. TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 15.09.\n\nBecause Appellees are not individuals, Rule 15.09 does not apply. Further, Doe\n\nsued the CDC in her official capacity, which is not a lawsuit against her as an\n\nindividual. See, e.g., Estate of Terrell v. Sisk, 111 S.W.3d 274, 282 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2003, no pet) (noting that an official-capacity suit against a\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                               3\n\fgovernmental employee is not a suit against the employee but against the\n\ngovernmental-unit employer). But even if it were a lawsuit against her\n\nindividually, Doe alleged that she acted without legal authority, which means that\n\nshe was not acting in the course of her official duties, as is required for Rule 15.09\n\nto provide immunity in this case. TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 15.09. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt erred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\nIV.   DOE’S CLAIMS ARE JUSTICIABLE\n\n      Appellees argue that Doe’s claims are not justiciable because he asks the\n\ntrial court to exercise authority it does not have, and because a declaratory\n\njudgment in this matter would be advisory because the SDP has already dismissed\n\nhis complaint. APPELLEES’ BRIEF at ** 26-31.\n\n      A.     The trial court has the authority to grant the relief Doe seeks\n\n      Citing the plurality in Gomez, Appellees argue that granting Doe’s requested\n\ndeclarations in this case would cause the trial court to usurp the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt’s authority. APPELLEE’S BRIEF at *27 (citing State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez,\n\n891 S.W.2d 243, 244—45, 246 (Tex. 1994)). Appellees further allege that lower\n\ncourts lack authority to interfere in disciplinary proceedings at any point in the\n\nprocess. Id. at *28 (citations omitted). However, none of the cases Appellees cite\n\napply here because in each case, the plaintiff asked the court to either create a new\n\nrule or obligation, or to enjoin the disciplinary proceedings. Id. at **27–28 (citing\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                                  4\n\fIn re State Bar of Tex., 440 S.W.3d 621 (Tex. 2014) (orig. proceeding) (finding\n\ntrial court cannot order Commission for Lawyer Discipline to turn over\n\ninvestigative records); Gomez, 891 S.W.2d at 244–45, 246 (holding trial court\n\ncannot order state bar to create a new program); State Bar of Tex. v. Jefferson, 942\n\nS.W.2d 575, 576 (Tex. 1997) (orig. proceeding) (concluding trial court cannot\n\nenjoin disciplinary investigative proceedings); Bd. of Disciplinary Appeals v.\n\nMcFall, 888 S.W.2d 471, 472 (Tex. 1994) (orig. proceeding) (per curiam) (finding\n\nthat trial court cannot enjoin a disciplinary suspension); State v. Sewell, 487\n\nS.W.2d 716 (Tex. 1972) (orig. proceeding) (holding trial court cannot enjoin\n\ndisciplinary investigative proceedings).\n\n      In the present case, Doe is not asking the court to create a new rule, institute\n\na new program, insert a new requirement, promulgate a new policy or regulation,\n\nor enjoin disciplinary proceedings. Doe is merely asking the court to declare that\n\nRule 2.16 does not require the CDC to withhold from Doe its recommendation to\n\nthe SDP. Appellees did not cite any case holding that a trial court cannot review a\n\nrule of disciplinary procedure. And in fact, a trial court is well within its authority\n\nin reviewing a rule of disciplinary procedure. See, e.g., Love v. State Bar of Tex.,\n\n982 S.W.2d 939, 942 (Tex. App. —Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, no pet.) (noting that\n\ndisciplinary rules have the force and effect of a statute and should be construed in\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                                   5\n\faccordance with rules of statutory construction). Thus, the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing the case on this ground.\n\n      B.     Doe does not seek an advisory opinion\n\n      Appellees argue that because the SDP has already dismissed Doe’s\n\ncomplaint, any opinion in this matter would be advisory, thus, this issue is moot.\n\nAPPELLEES’ BRIEF at **29–31. However, as discussed in Doe’s opening brief, this\n\ncase satisfies the “public interest” exception to the mootness doctrine. See\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF at **9–11.\n\n      Appellees attempt to hide behind the SDP, asserting that any future\n\ngrievance Doe may file will not be “handicapped” by the CDC’s refusal to provide\n\na copy of its recommendation to the SDP. This is so because, Appellees contend,\n\nthe SDP, not the CDC, decides to dismiss complaints. Therefore, Appellees argue,\n\nDoe will receive no benefit from reviewing the CDC’s recommendation.\n\nHowever, it is the CDC who determines whether “just cause” exists to further\n\ninvestigate a complaint, and it is the CDC who recommends dismissal to the SDP.\n\nSee TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.13.\n\n      Reviewing the CDC’s recommendation in this matter will provide Doe, the\n\ncomplainant, with information as to why his sixteen-page complaint failed, in the\n\nCDC’s eyes, to provide “just cause.” Such information will play a critical role in\n\naiding a member of the public, aggrieved by the behavior of an attorney, in\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                              6\n\fadequately presenting the issues to the CDC. Therefore, an opinion in this matter\n\nwill not be advisory, and the trial court erred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      “The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is\n\nundertaken in the public interest rather than in furtherance of parochial or self-\n\ninterested concerns of the bar . . .

Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158 (“There is no right to judicial review of an administrative order unless a statute\n        explicitly provides that right or the order violates a constitutional right.”) (citations omitted).

See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 160 (Brister, J.,\n        concurring) (“A different case might be presented if the plaintiffs alleged the board was clearly violating some provision\n        of the statute.

Here,\n       Heinrich is not challenging the validity of the bylaws or the governing statute, but rather petitioners' actions under them.\n7      State officials may, of course, be sued in both their official and individual capacities. Judgments against state officials in\n       their individual capacities will not bind the state. See Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 757, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d\n       636 (1999) (“Even a suit for money damages may be prosecuted against a state officer in his individual capacity for\n       unconstitutional or wrongful conduct fairly attributable to the officer himself, so long as the relief is sought not from the\n       state treasury but from the officer personally.”).\n8      Further, although the parties do not address it, we note that the reduction in Heinrich's survivor payments occurred before\n       the effective date of article XVI, section 66 of the Texas Constitution (“Protected Benefits Under Certain Public Retirement\n       Systems”), and we do not consider whether it would otherwise apply in this case.\n9      While this case was pending on interlocutory appeal, the Legislature enacted 271.151–.160 of the Local Government\n       Code, waiving immunity from suit for certain claims against cities and other governmental entities. Heinrich does not\n       argue that her claims fall within these provisions, and we express no opinion on that subject.\n10     Because the mayor of El Paso, who is also a Board member, was named as a defendant in his official capacity, Heinrich\n       may seek liability from the City through that officer, although her claims against the City itself must be dismissed.\n11     The Fund, the Board, and the Board members objected to this evidence. The trial court did not explicitly rule on the\n       objections, and the petitioners do not raise any evidentiary issues on appeal.\n12     The court of appeals failed to draw this distinction, instead discussing the protections available to officials from\n       governmental immunity. 198 S.W.3d at 407.

Since inception of the\n       mandatory IOLTA program, the foundation has distributed approximately $42 million to assist people unable to afford\n       an attorney in civil actions.\n1      The current pro bono policy was adopted by the State Bar of Texas Board of Directors in May 1992. The policy includes\n       an aspirational goal of fifty (50) hours per year and an annual voluntary pro bono reporting system.\n2      We need not decide in this case whether Plaintiffs could have proceeded against this Court itself. Like other state courts\n       of last resort, we have been named defendants in district court at least once before. Cameron v. Greenhill, 582 S.W.2d\n       775 (Tex.1979); see also CWA Local 1044 v. Chief Justice of the Sup. Ct., 118 N.J. 495, 572 A.2d 613 (1990) (challenging\n       a New Jersey Supreme Court decision made in the course of labor negotiations with its judicial employees); American\n       Trial Lawyers Ass'n v. New Jersey Sup. Ct., 66 N.J. 258, 330 A.2d 350 (1974) (challenging a New Jersey Supreme\n       Court order limiting contingent attorney's fees in certain tort cases); Vermont Sup. Ct. Admin. Directive No. 17 v. Vermont\n       Sup. Ct., 154 Vt. 217, 576 A.2d 127 (1990) (challenging a Vermont Supreme Court order postponing civil jury trials due\n       to budgetary shortfalls). But some jurisdictions expressly proscribe suing the state's highest court. See, e.g., Goetz v.\n       Harrison, 153 Mont. 403, 457 P.2d 911 (1969) (holding that a lower court has no supervisory control over the Supreme\n       Court and thus cannot entertain a challenge to a Supreme Court rule relating to bar admissions).\n3      It is unclear whether the Court is creating a “parallel administrative docket” in which interested persons could petition the\n       Court for various forms of relief. Are these “petitioners” entitled to timely consideration of their petition and oral argument?\n       See Barger v. Brock, 535 S.W.2d 337, 342 (Tenn.1976) (“[I]n order that the parties may have their insistences considered,\n       we direct that all pleadings in this cause be delivered to the Clerk of this Court at Nashville forthwith. This Court will treat\n       the pleadings as constituting a motion to vacate or modify Rule 42. This matter will be docketed for oral argument, in\n       Knoxville, at the heel of the calendar on 7 May 1976. Briefs will be filed with the Clerk in Nashville by 23 April 1976. The\n       sole issue before the Court is the constitutionality of Rule 42.”).\n4      Our lack of an original proceeding may actually be salutary. This Court's resolution of complex questions concerning\n       the constitutionality of our rules would most likely be enhanced by the fuller development of issues and arguments that\n       usually attend the appellate process.\n\n\nEnd of Document                                                  © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

G App. A, Art. 10, § 9, Preamble\n\n                                           Preamble: A Lawyer's Responsibilities\n\n                                                          Currentness\n\n\n1. A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for\nthe quality of justice. Lawyers, as guardians of the law, play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this\nrole requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship with and function in our legal system. A consequent obligation\nof lawyers is to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct.\n\n2. As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed\nunderstanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer\nzealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous\nto the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks\nto reconcile their divergent interests as an advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. A lawyer acts as\nevaluator by examining a client's affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.\n\n3. In all professional functions, a lawyer should zealously pursue clients' interests within the bounds of the law. In doing so,\na lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the\nrepresentation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure\nis required or permitted by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\n\n4. A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's\nbusiness and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or\nintimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other\nlawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also\na lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.\n\n5. As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice and the quality of service\nrendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond\nits use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be\nmindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor,\ncannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A\nlawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.\n\n6. A lawyer should render public interest legal service. The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable\nto pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional\nworkload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The\nprovision of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees is a moral obligation of each lawyer as well as the\nprofession generally. A lawyer may discharge this basic responsibility by providing public interest legal services without fee, or\nat a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable\norganization representation, the administration of justice, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services\nto persons of limited means.\n\n7. In the nature of law practice, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from\napparent conflict between a lawyer's responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer's own interests. The\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such tensions. They do so by stating minimum\nstandards of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action. Within the framework of these\nRules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. The Rules and their Comments constitute a body of principles\nupon which the lawyer can rely for guidance in resolving such issues through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral\njudgment. In applying these rules, lawyers may find interpretive guidance in the principles developed in the Comments.\n\n8. The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is undertaken in the public interest rather than in\nfurtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar, and to insist that every lawyer both comply with its minimum\ndisciplinary standards and aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the\nindependence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\n\n9. Each lawyer's own conscience is the touchstone against which to test the extent to which his actions may rise above the\ndisciplinary standards prescribed by these rules. The desire for the respect and confidence of the members of the profession\nand of the society which it serves provides the lawyer the incentive to attain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The\npossible loss of that respect and confidence is the ultimate sanction. So long as its practitioners are guided by these principles,\nthe law will continue to be a noble profession. This is its greatness and its strength, which permit of no compromise.\n\n\nCredits\nAdopted by order of Oct. 17, 1989, eff.

The immunity\ngranted by this subsection is absolute and unqualified.\n\n\n(h) The state bar or a court may not require an attorney against whom a disciplinary action has been brought to disclose\ninformation protected by the attorney-client privilege if the client did not initiate the grievance that is the subject of the action.\n\n\n(i) A panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar that votes on a grievance matter shall disclose to the complainant\nand the respondent in the matter the number of members of the panel:\n\n\n  (1) voting for a finding of just cause;\n\n\n  (2) voting against a finding of just cause; and\n\n\n  (3) abstaining from voting on the matter.\n\n\n(j) A quorum of a panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar must include one public member for each two attorney\nmembers.\n\n\n(k) A member of a panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar may vote on a grievance matter to which the panel\nwas assigned only if the member is present at the hearing at which the vote takes place.\n\n\n(l) A person may be appointed to serve on a panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar only if the person is a\nmember of the district grievance committee from which the panel was assigned and the person was appointed to serve on the\ncommittee in strict accordance with the Texas Rules of Disciplinary Procedure.\n\n\n(m) A panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar may not be changed in size for the purpose of obtaining a quorum\non the panel without the approval of the complainant and the respondent in the grievance matter to which the panel was assigned.\n\n\n(n) A member of a panel of a district grievance committee of the state bar may not be substituted with another member of the\ndistrict grievance committee on the day of the hearing for which the panel was assigned without the approval of the complainant\nand the respondent in the grievance matter.\n\n\n(o) Whenever a grievance is either dismissed as an inquiry or dismissed as a complaint in accordance with the Texas Rules\nof Disciplinary Procedure and that dismissal has become final, the respondent attorney may thereafter deny that a grievance\nwas pursued and may file a motion with the tribunal seeking expunction of all records on the matter, other than statistical or\nidentifying information maintained by the chief disciplinary counsel pertaining to the grievance.\n\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

RULE 2.16\n\n      The underlying question in this case is whether Rule 2.16 requires\n\n“Disciplinary Proceedings” to be kept confidential from complainants. It does not,\n\nand because it does not, there is no authority for the CDC to deny Doe’s request for\n\na copy of its recommendation to the SDP.\n\n      The express language of Rule 2.16 does not contemplate excluding\n\ncomplainants. In relevant part, Rule 2.16 states, “[a]ll members and staff of the\n\nOffice of Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Board of Disciplinary Appeals, Committees,\n\nand Commission shall maintain as confidential all Disciplinary Proceedings and\n\nassociated records . . . .” TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.16. Rule 2.16 omits any\n\nlanguage requiring Disciplinary Proceedings to be kept confidential from the\n\ncomplainant, the very person who started the proceedings in the first place.\n\n      Furthermore, the Texas Government Code expressly allows the complainant\n\nto be physically present at some “Disciplinary Proceedings,” including Evidentiary\n\nPanel proceedings. TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 81.072(b)(10); see TEX. R.\n\nDISCIPLINARY P. 1.06L (defining “Disciplinary Proceedings” to include the\n\nproceeding before an Evidentiary Panel); see also TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.16.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                             1\n\f      The CDC’s interpretation of Rule 2.16, as requiring “Disciplinary\n\nProceedings” to remain confidential from the complainant, cannot stand. This is\n\nparticularly evident because Disciplinary Proceedings include Evidentiary Panel\n\nproceedings, before which the complainant has an express right to appear.\n\nBecause Rule 2.16 does not apply to complainants, this Court should reverse the\n\ntrial court’s dismissal and remand this case for rulings on the substantive issues\n\npresented in Doe’s pleadings.\n\nII.   SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR DOE’S CLAIMS\n\n      Appellees assert that neither exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity\n\napplies. See APPELLEE’S BRIEF at **20–24. First, Appellees claim that Doe did\n\nnot challenge Rule 2.16’s validity. Id. at **20–22. Then, appellees claim that the\n\nultra vires exception does not apply because Doe seeks to compel a government\n\nofficial to affirmatively perform a discretionary act. Id. at **22–24.\n\n      A.     Appellees cannot validly apply Rule 2.16 to Doe\n\n      Despite Appellees’ characterizations of Doe’s arguments, the issue Doe\n\nraises is whether Rule 2.16 can be applied to him, not how Rule 2.16 is applied.\n\nSee APPELLEES’ BRIEF at **20–21. In his live pleading, and on appeal, Doe\n\ncontends that Rule 2.16 does not apply to complainants, including himself. See,\n\ne.g., infra I. As the complainant, Doe is a participant in the proceedings, not\n\nmerely an uninvolved member of the public, so Rule 2.16 does not apply to him.\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                              2\n\fSee TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 81.072(b)(10); TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 1.06L, 2.16.\n\nBecause Rule 2.16 does not apply to Doe, the trial court erred in dismissing the\n\ncase on this ground.\n\n       B.    Doe properly asserts an ultra vires claim against the CDC\n\n       Doe’s claim is a proper ultra vires claim. He alleges that Linda Acevedo,\n\nthe CDC, denied him a copy of the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP, without\n\nlegal authority to do so. That is the very nature of an ultra vires claim: a\n\ngovernmental official takes an action that it lacked authority to take. See, e.g., City\n\nof El Paso v. Heinrich, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372 (Tex. 2009). Because Rule 2.16 did\n\nnot authorize Linda Acevedo to take the action she did (withhold from Doe a copy\n\nof the CDC’s recommendation to the SDP), she acted ultra vires, and the trial court\n\nerred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\nIII.   STATUTORY IMMUNITY DOES NOT BAR DOE’S CLAIMS\n\n       Appellees argue that Rule 15.09 blankets them with immunity. APPELLEES’\n\nBRIEF at **24–26. However, Rule 15.09 applies only to (1) individuals who are\n\n(2) acting in the course of their official duties. TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 15.09.\n\nBecause Appellees are not individuals, Rule 15.09 does not apply. Further, Doe\n\nsued the CDC in her official capacity, which is not a lawsuit against her as an\n\nindividual. See, e.g., Estate of Terrell v. Sisk, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758601\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758601/terrell-ex-rel-estate-of-terrell-v-sisk/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 282 (Tex. App.—\n\nTexarkana 2003, no pet) (noting that an official-capacity suit against a\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                               3\n\fgovernmental employee is not a suit against the employee but against the\n\ngovernmental-unit employer). But even if it were a lawsuit against her\n\nindividually, Doe alleged that she acted without legal authority, which means that\n\nshe was not acting in the course of her official duties, as is required for Rule 15.09\n\nto provide immunity in this case. TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 15.09. Thus, the trial\n\ncourt erred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\nIV.   DOE’S CLAIMS ARE JUSTICIABLE\n\n      Appellees argue that Doe’s claims are not justiciable because he asks the\n\ntrial court to exercise authority it does not have, and because a declaratory\n\njudgment in this matter would be advisory because the SDP has already dismissed\n\nhis complaint. APPELLEES’ BRIEF at ** 26-31.\n\n      A.     The trial court has the authority to grant the relief Doe seeks\n\n      Citing the plurality in Gomez, Appellees argue that granting Doe’s requested\n\ndeclarations in this case would cause the trial court to usurp the Texas Supreme\n\nCourt’s authority. APPELLEE’S BRIEF at *27 (citing State Bar of Tex. v. Gomez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1504474\"><a href=\"/opinion/1504474/the-state-bar-of-texas-v-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244—45, 246 (Tex. 1994)). Appellees further allege that lower\n\ncourts lack authority to interfere in disciplinary proceedings at any point in the\n\nprocess. Id. at *28 (citations omitted).

Doe is merely asking the court to declare that\n\nRule 2.16 does not require the CDC to withhold from Doe its recommendation to\n\nthe SDP. Appellees did not cite any case holding that a trial court cannot review a\n\nrule of disciplinary procedure. And in fact, a trial court is well within its authority\n\nin reviewing a rule of disciplinary procedure. See, e.g., Love v.

Thus, the trial court erred in\n\ndismissing the case on this ground.\n\n      B.     Doe does not seek an advisory opinion\n\n      Appellees argue that because the SDP has already dismissed Doe’s\n\ncomplaint, any opinion in this matter would be advisory, thus, this issue is moot.\n\nAPPELLEES’ BRIEF at **29–31. However, as discussed in Doe’s opening brief, this\n\ncase satisfies the “public interest” exception to the mootness doctrine. See\n\nAPPELLANT’S BRIEF at **9–11.\n\n      Appellees attempt to hide behind the SDP, asserting that any future\n\ngrievance Doe may file will not be “handicapped” by the CDC’s refusal to provide\n\na copy of its recommendation to the SDP. This is so because, Appellees contend,\n\nthe SDP, not the CDC, decides to dismiss complaints. Therefore, Appellees argue,\n\nDoe will receive no benefit from reviewing the CDC’s recommendation.\n\nHowever, it is the CDC who determines whether “just cause” exists to further\n\ninvestigate a complaint, and it is the CDC who recommends dismissal to the SDP.\n\nSee TEX. R. DISCIPLINARY P. 2.13.\n\n      Reviewing the CDC’s recommendation in this matter will provide Doe, the\n\ncomplainant, with information as to why his sixteen-page complaint failed, in the\n\nCDC’s eyes, to provide “just cause.” Such information will play a critical role in\n\naiding a member of the public, aggrieved by the behavior of an attorney, in\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                              6\n\fadequately presenting the issues to the CDC. Therefore, an opinion in this matter\n\nwill not be advisory, and the trial court erred in dismissing the case on this ground.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      “The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is\n\nundertaken in the public interest rather than in furtherance of parochial or self-\n\ninterested concerns of the bar . . . [n]eglect of these responsibilities compromises\n\nthe independence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.” TEX.\n\nDISCIPLINARY R. PROF’L CONDUCT, Preamble ¶ 8. Allowing the CDC to hide its\n\nrecommendation to the SDP from the complainant violates the principles espoused\n\nin the Preamble mentioned above. Rule 2.16 does not require such secrecy. The\n\ntrial court erred in dismissing this case on the procedural grounds raised by\n\nAppellees.\n\n                                      PRAYER\n\n      Appellant John Doe prays that this Court reverse the trial court’s dismissal\n\nand remand this case for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\nAPPELLANT’S REPLY BRIEF                                                                7\n\f                               Respectfully submitted,\n\n                               WEST, WEBB, ALLBRITTON & GENTRY, P.C.\n                               1515 Emerald Plaza\n                               College Station, Texas 77845-1515\n                               Telephone: (979) 694-7000\n                               Facsimile: (979) 694-8000\n\n                               By: /s Gaines West\n                                 GAINES WEST\n                                 State Bar No. 21197500\n                                 gaines.west@westwebblaw.com\n                                 JENNIFER D.

G App. A, Art. 10, § 9, Preamble\n\n                                           Preamble: A Lawyer's Responsibilities\n\n                                                          Currentness\n\n\n1. A lawyer is a representative of clients, an officer of the legal system and a public citizen having special responsibility for\nthe quality of justice. Lawyers, as guardians of the law, play a vital role in the preservation of society. The fulfillment of this\nrole requires an understanding by lawyers of their relationship with and function in our legal system. A consequent obligation\nof lawyers is to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct.\n\n2. As a representative of clients, a lawyer performs various functions. As advisor, a lawyer provides a client with an informed\nunderstanding of the client's legal rights and obligations and explains their practical implications. As advocate, a lawyer\nzealously asserts the client's position under the rules of the adversary system. As negotiator, a lawyer seeks a result advantageous\nto the client but consistent with requirements of honest dealing with others. As intermediary between clients, a lawyer seeks\nto reconcile their divergent interests as an advisor and, to a limited extent, as a spokesperson for each client. A lawyer acts as\nevaluator by examining a client's affairs and reporting about them to the client or to others.\n\n3. In all professional functions, a lawyer should zealously pursue clients' interests within the bounds of the law. In doing so,\na lawyer should be competent, prompt and diligent. A lawyer should maintain communication with a client concerning the\nrepresentation. A lawyer should keep in confidence information relating to representation of a client except so far as disclosure\nis required or permitted by the Texas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct or other law.\n\n4. A lawyer's conduct should conform to the requirements of the law, both in professional service to clients and in the lawyer's\nbusiness and personal affairs. A lawyer should use the law's procedures only for legitimate purposes and not to harass or\nintimidate others. A lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other\nlawyers and public officials. While it is a lawyer's duty, when necessary, to challenge the rectitude of official action, it is also\na lawyer's duty to uphold legal process.\n\n5. As a public citizen, a lawyer should seek improvement of the law, the administration of justice and the quality of service\nrendered by the legal profession. As a member of a learned profession, a lawyer should cultivate knowledge of the law beyond\nits use for clients, employ that knowledge in reform of the law and work to strengthen legal education. A lawyer should be\nmindful of deficiencies in the administration of justice and of the fact that the poor, and sometimes persons who are not poor,\ncannot afford adequate legal assistance, and should therefore devote professional time and civic influence in their behalf. A\nlawyer should aid the legal profession in pursuing these objectives and should help the bar regulate itself in the public interest.\n\n6. A lawyer should render public interest legal service. The basic responsibility for providing legal services for those unable\nto pay ultimately rests upon the individual lawyer, and personal involvement in the problems of the disadvantaged can be one\n\n\n\n                © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or professional\nworkload, should find time to participate in or otherwise support the provision of legal services to the disadvantaged. The\nprovision of free legal services to those unable to pay reasonable fees is a moral obligation of each lawyer as well as the\nprofession generally. A lawyer may discharge this basic responsibility by providing public interest legal services without fee, or\nat a substantially reduced fee, in one or more of the following areas: poverty law, civil rights law, public rights law, charitable\norganization representation, the administration of justice, and by financial support for organizations that provide legal services\nto persons of limited means.\n\n7. In the nature of law practice, conflicting responsibilities are encountered. Virtually all difficult ethical problems arise from\napparent conflict between a lawyer's responsibilities to clients, to the legal system and to the lawyer's own interests. The\nTexas Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct prescribe terms for resolving such tensions. They do so by stating minimum\nstandards of conduct below which no lawyer can fall without being subject to disciplinary action. Within the framework of these\nRules many difficult issues of professional discretion can arise. The Rules and their Comments constitute a body of principles\nupon which the lawyer can rely for guidance in resolving such issues through the exercise of sensitive professional and moral\njudgment. In applying these rules, lawyers may find interpretive guidance in the principles developed in the Comments.\n\n8. The legal profession has a responsibility to assure that its regulation is undertaken in the public interest rather than in\nfurtherance of parochial or self-interested concerns of the bar, and to insist that every lawyer both comply with its minimum\ndisciplinary standards and aid in securing their observance by other lawyers. Neglect of these responsibilities compromises the\nindependence of the profession and the public interest which it serves.\n\n9. Each lawyer's own conscience is the touchstone against which to test the extent to which his actions may rise above the\ndisciplinary standards prescribed by these rules. The desire for the respect and confidence of the members of the profession\nand of the society which it serves provides the lawyer the incentive to attain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct. The\npossible loss of that respect and confidence is the ultimate sanction. So long as its practitioners are guided by these principles,\nthe law will continue to be a noble profession. This is its greatness and its strength, which permit of no compromise.\n\n\nCredits\nAdopted by order of Oct. 17, 1989, eff.
