(FTR) and Nizar Katbi (Katbi) (collectively\nFTR Parties) from bidding or working on District projects for five years. Alleging\nvarious wrongs, the FTR Parties sued the Board and six of its individual trustees\n(Trustees).1 The Board and Trustees appeal from: (1) the denial of their anti-SLAPP2\nmotion to strike the FTR Parties’ first amended complaint (FAC); (2) the denial of the\nTrustees’ anti-SLAPP motion to strike the new claims in the third amended complaint\n(TAC); and (3) the award of attorney fees to the FTR Parties after the trial court found\nthat the first anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous.\n       Based on qualified immunity, we conclude that the first anti-SLAPP motion\nshould have been granted as to the FTR Parties’ personal capacity claim against the\nTrustees for denial of procedural due process at the debarment hearing in violation of title\n42 United States Code section 1983 (section 1983). Because of the immunities in\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9, the second anti-SLAPP motion should have\nbeen granted as to the FTR Parties’ claim for intentional interference with contract and/or\nprospective economic advantage, and their claim for negligence. The award of attorney\nfees must be reversed because the first anti-SLAPP motion had partial merit and was not\nfrivolous as a matter of law. In all other respects, the orders are affirmed.\n       Upon remand, what remains for further proceedings are: a taxpayer claim against\nthe Board and Trustees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a; official\ncapacity claims against the Trustees under section 1983 for denial of procedural due\nprocess and First Amendment retaliation; and a personal capacity claim against the\nTrustees under section 1983 for First Amendment retaliation.\n\n\n1\n      The Trustees are Miguel Santiago, Tina Park (Trustee Park), Nancy Pearlman,\nKelly Candaele, Scott J. Svonkin, and Steve Veres.\n2\n       “SLAPP” is shorthand for strategic lawsuit against public participation. (Fahlen v.\nSutter Central Valley Hospitals (2014) 58 Cal.4th 655, 665.) The anti-SLAPP statute is\nCode of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                          FACTS3\n       The Project at Los Angeles Valley College\n       In 2006, the District contracted with FTR to build the Allied Health and Science\nBuilding at Los Angeles Valley College (Allied Project). Robert Payinda (Payinda) was\nthe District’s project inspector. The Allied Project was substantially complete in 2008.\n       Katbi negotiated with the District’s project manager to finalize the job and settle\nall outstanding issues in exchange for a $40,000 credit from FTR. The District’s project\nmanager told FTR it had no more responsibility on the project. As a result, FTR and the\nDistrict entered into a final change order that stated: “This is a final change order for full\nand final settlement for all disputes, extras, credits, back charges, time delays, delay for\ndamages and/or impact between both parties.” Katbi understood that after signing the\nfinal change order, FTR and the District would not have claims against each other.\nSubsequently, he submitted a Division of the State Architect Verified Report (DSA 6\nForm) and represented that the Allied Project was 100 percent complete.4 On August 3,\n2009, the Board ratified the final change order between the parties.\n       On March 24, 2010, FTR filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the District\nto release funds withheld pursuant to stop notices.\n\n3\n       Below, the District and Trustees objected to evidence submitted by the FTR\nParties. The Board and Trustees contend that the trial court erred by overruling a\nmajority of those objections. The objections in connection with the first anti-SLAPP\nmotion have been waived on appeal because the Board and Trustees failed to analyze\ntheir objections by applying the relevant law to the specific objectionable evidence.\n(Alvarez v. Jacmar Pacific Pizza Corp. (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1206, fn. 11 [“It is\nnot our responsibility to develop an appellant’s argument”].) Certain objections\npertaining to the second anti-SLAPP motion have been adequately briefed, and we have\nconsidered them. Our statements of facts was written with these considerations in mind.\n4\n         At the debarment hearing, the architect for the Allied Project, Andrew Labov, was\nasked to explain the difference between substantial completion and 100 percent\ncompletion. He testified: “The difference is . . . that substantial completion you identify\nthat . . . work is still remaining to be done on the project, and final completion is when all\nparties agree that all of that work has been completed or the owner waives his right and\naccepts work in the as-is condition.”\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       As authorized by the Board, the District filed a cross-complaint and alleged that\nFTR was negligent and breached its contract by performing defective work when\nconstructing the Allied Project. In a statement of claims, the District listed $4,366,111.64\nin damages.5\n       The Project at Los Angeles Mission College\n       In 2007, the District hired FTR as the general contractor to build the Health and\nPhysical Education Fitness Center at Los Angeles Mission College (Mission Project). By\nmid-2008, the District issued change order No. 1, which related to a pipeline and\nearthwork. In addition, the college project manager, Nick Quintanilla (Quintanilla),6\nasked FTR to comply with field order Nos. 36 and 37, which was grading and trenching\nwork outside the scope of the original project. At first, FTR balked at the field orders\nbecause it had not been paid about $1 million for already completed extra work.\nHowever, Katbi told his employees to move forward, and they did.\n       FTR drafted pay request No. 14, which it submitted to the District. In that pay\nrequest, for each item, FTR estimated how much work was completed and how much it\nexpected to complete by the end of July 2008. Regarding change order No. 1, FTR\nestimated that 43 percent was complete.\n       Quintanilla spoke to his superiors and was advised that the District’s executive\ndirector, Larry Eisenberg (Eisenberg), and others wanted to avoid any delays and had\ntherefore approved paying FTR for extra work with money earmarked for other items.\nSubsequently, Quintanilla told FTR to bill 90 percent of the work on change order No. 1.\n\n\n\n5\n        The record suggests that this action was deemed related to a lawsuit filed by\nHickman Mechanical, Inc. against FTR (Hickman Mechanical, Inc. v. FTR International,\nInc. et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. BC398074) (Hickman Action).\n6\n       Through a construction company called Gateway, Quintanilla was the person hired\nby the District to supervise the Mission Project. Communication between FTR and the\nDistrict went through Quintanilla. FTR submitted pay applications once a month after\nnegotiating the percentages with Quintanilla.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fFTR revised pay request No. 14 as Quintanilla instructed, and it was then paid by the\nDistrict.7\n       The Los Angeles Times Articles\n       In February 2011, the Los Angeles Times published a series of articles accusing\ncollege officials, contractors and the Board of wasting tens of millions of dollars due to\npoor planning, frivolous spending and shoddy workmanship. A March 2011 article\nfocused on the Allied Project. It claimed that the project had numerous and serious\ndefects and was critical of FTR, Eisenberg and many others. According to the article,\nPayinda issued 422 citations for deviations in design. Later in the same month, the\nLos Angeles Times published an article stating that the District had fired Eisenberg, and\nthat he would be replaced by Thomas Hall (Hall) as the interim executive director.\n       Katbi’s Letter to the Trustees\n       In a letter dated October 5, 2011, Katbi wrote to the Trustees to defend FTR\nagainst rumors, gossip and false statements made by the Los Angeles Times and former\nDistrict employees. According to the letter: None of the accusations against FTR were\ntrue. The problems at the Allied Project were caused by subcontractors, and FTR had\ninsurance in place to cover the defective work. The real problem at the Allied Project\nwas Payinda. He was a racist who repeatedly disparaged Arabs, who he referred to as\n“turban heads.” In addition, he said companies such as FTR should not be allowed to\ntake jobs away from American companies. At one point, FTR complained to the District\nthat Payinda was using foul language to FTR’s employees and displaying lewd pictures\nof naked women on the walls of the trailer/office that he used on the college campus.\nAfter FTR complained, Payinda smeared FTR by blaming it for all the design errors and\ncreating a long list of nonconforming work. Moreover, Payinda submitted fraudulent\nbills to the District for his time and that of an assistant inspector. Based on Payinda as a\n\n\n\n7\n       The FTR parties represent that the District “later modified the paperwork to reflect\nthe proper payments and work done under the proper work orders.”\n\n\n                                              5\n\fsource, the Los Angeles Times published several articles containing false statements that\npainted FTR in a negative light.\n       Continuing on, the letter stated that when FTR submitted the low bid on a project\nat East Los Angeles College, the second and third low bidders sent protest letters. One of\nthe protests falsely stated that FTR had been terminated on a project at Pierce College.\nThe District informed FTR it planned to honor the protests and reject FTR’s bid. This\nwas done in bad faith because the District made the decision before reviewing FTR’s\nresponses to the protests.\n       Notice of Debarment Hearing\n       The District’s staff recommended that the FTR Parties be debarred for five years.\nIn a letter dated October 17, 2011, Hall notified the FTR Parties that a committee of the\nTrustees would hold a hearing in December 2011 to determine whether the FTR Parties\nshould be debarred for up to five years from bidding, contracting, subcontracting or\nperforming work on any District project, and whether the FTR Parties should be found\nnonresponsible bidders with respect to the Math & Science Complex at East Los Angeles\nCollege.\n       The letter listed the following three charges:\n       (I) When FTR submitted pay request No. 14 in connection with the Mission\nProject, the pay request falsely stated that change order No. 1 was 90 percent complete.\n(II) FTR submitted a false DSA-6 Form for the Allied Project stating that the “entire\n[Division of the State Architect (DSA)] approved scope is 100 [percent] complete,” that\nall noncompliant work was completed, and that “all construction has, in every material\nrespect, been performed in compliance with the DSA approved documents.” (III) FTR\nfailed to construct the exterior envelope of the Allied Project, FTR substituted improper\nand inadequate materials, and it failed to meet the standard of care in the construction\nindustry.\n       The FTR Parties’ Ex Parte Application\n       FTR filed an ex parte application seeking a temporary restraining order and an\norder to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction preventing the District from\n\n                                             6\n\fholding a debarment hearing. Also, FTR requested leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint to add a cause of action for an injunction enjoining the District from\nproceeding with the debarment hearing during the pendency of litigation, and a cause of\naction seeking a declaration from the trial court that the debarment hearing was\nunconstitutional and illegal.\n       In support of the application, Katbi submitted a declaration stating that FTR would\ngo out of business if it was debarred.\n       The ex parte application was denied.\n       The FTR Parties’ Prehearing Requests; the District’s Response\n       Via an e-mail to the Board’s counsel, David Orbach (Orbach), the FTR Parties\nrequested an opportunity to voir dire the Trustees. Then, in a letter to Orbach, the FTR\nParties objected to the Board being the arbiter of the debarment hearing on the grounds of\nbias. According to the FTR Parties, the Board was biased, inter alia, because of the\nongoing litigation between FTR and the District, and because the FTR Parties had been\nsingled out for selective prosecution due to Katbi being an Arab-American of Syrian\ndescent. The FTR Parties requested a hearing before a neutral hearing officer pursuant to\nBoard Rule 71400.40.\n       Orbach responded by letter and informed the FTR Parties that the District intended\nto proceed with the hearing as noticed. He indicated that the FTR Parties would not be\nallowed to voir dire the Trustees.\n       The Debarment Hearing Before the Committee\n       The debarment hearing was held before a Board committee comprised of Trustee\nPark and Mona Field (Trustee Field).8 Trustee Park indicated at the outset that the staff\nrecommendation of debarment would be presented by attorneys Keith Smith and Stewart\nReid from the law firm of Wood, Smith, Henning and Berman, and that the committee\nand Board would be independently advised by Orbach. Camille A. Goulet (Goulet), from\nthe District’s Office of the General Counsel, was also present. As the hearing proceeded,\n\n8\n       Trustee Field is not a party to the litigation.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fvarious witnesses testified. Orbach advised the committee on such issues as how to\nproceed and how to rule on evidentiary objections. At one point, the FTR Parties’\nattorney objected to a question, and Orbach stated, “The witness may go ahead and\nanswer.”\n       When the parties finished presenting their evidence and arguments, counsel for the\nFTR Parties requested findings on their affirmative defenses of estoppel, unclean hands,\nlaches and selective prosecution. Orbach informed the committee that “it would be my\nrecommendation that you do not respond to counsel’s request[.]” He went on to provide\nthe committee with written findings. They read the findings into the record, made some\nmodifications, and then voted to adopt the findings and recommend a three-year\ndebarment. As recommended by Orbach, the committee did not rule on the affirmative\ndefenses.\n       Following the hearing, Orbach prepared a document entitled Committee’s Report,\nFindings and Recommendation.\n       The District’s Debarment of the FTR Parties\n       In February 2013, the full Board convened and considered the recommendation of\nthe committee. Orbach fielded questions from the Trustees regarding the length of the\ndebarment and other matters. The Board voted to debar the FTR Parties for five years.9\nLater, the Board terminated five existing projects with FTR. As a result, the District\nrefused to pay over $10 million that it owed to FTR for work it had completed on those\nprojects.\n       FTR’s Losses on Projects for Other Entities; FTR Goes out of Business\n       At the time of the debarment, FTR had existing projects with the City of Long\nBeach Board of Harbor Commissioners, the City of Los Angeles Board of Harbor\nCommissioners, the Signal Hill Redevelopment Agency, the Southern California\nRegional Rail Authority, the City of Irvine, and the City of La Quinta. Due to the\ndebarment, FTR’s creditors placed stop notices on FTR projects and refused to provide\n\n9\n       While Trustee Field voted yes to debar the FTR Parties for three years, she voted\nno to debarring them for five years.\n\n                                             8\n\fFTR with credit. It was unable to obtain surety bonds, and therefore it was unable to bid\non additional projects. FTR lost millions of dollars in contract balances, change orders,\nretention and lost profits.\n          Shortly after the debarment, FTR went out of business. It laid off nearly 300\nemployees, and its creditors filed claims to recover more than $25 million. Because\nKatbi personally guaranteed all of FTR’s loans, Katbi suffered financial loss, and damage\nto his reputation and creditworthiness.\n          The FTR Parties’ New Action\n          The FTR Parties filed a combined petition for writ of administrative mandate\nchallenging the debarment order and a complaint for damages. In the complaint, they\nalleged a federal civil rights claim under section 1983 for violation of due process, and a\ntaxpayer claim under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a. The section 1983 claim\nsought damages. Both claims sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The Board as well\nas the Trustees were named as defendants. The case was deemed related to the parties’\nongoing litigation in the Hickman Action.\n          Subsequently, the FTR Parties filed the FAC.\n          The Trial Court’s Decision to Grant FTR’s Petition for Writ of Mandate\n          The trial court held a hearing on the writ petition and made, inter alia, the\nfollowing findings: (1) all charges sustained against the FTR Parties by the Board should\nbe found in favor of the FTR Parties; (2) the Board failed to properly consider FTR’s\nequitable defenses; (3) the debarment hearing should have been held before a neutral\narbitrator; and (4) there was an unacceptable probability that the Board was biased\nbecause any finding in favor of the FTR Parties would have undermined the Board’s\nlawsuit against them. The trial court issued a writ directing the Board to set aside the\ndebarment order. It then ruled that charge III could be relitigated, but charges I and II\nwere barred by equitable estoppel and waiver, and that charge I was also barred by\nlaches.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f       The First Anti-SLAPP Motion\n       The Board and Trustees filed an anti-SLAPP motion to the section 1983 and\ntaxpayer claims and argued, among other things, that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the federal claim. The motion was denied, and the Board and Trustees\nappealed.\n       The FTR Parties filed a motion for attorney fees on the grounds that the anti-\nSLAPP motion was frivolous. The trial court granted the motion and awarded the FTR\nParties $72,897.80. Once again, the Board and Trustees appealed.\n       The TAC; the Second Anti-SLAPP Motion; the Demurrer\n       Pursuant to a stipulation, the eventual second amended complaint was superseded\nby the TAC. It alleged a second section 1983 claim. It was based on alleged retaliation,\ninter alia, for Katbi’s exercise of his First Amendment right to send the October 5, 2011,\nletter to the Trustees. Also, the TAC alleged a claim for intentional interference with\ncontract and/or prospective economic advantage, and also a claim for negligence.\n       The Trustees filed an anti-SLAPP motion to the retaliation, interference and\nnegligence claims. As to the federal claim, they argued that they could not be sued under\nsection 1983 for their official actions and, in any event, they enjoyed absolute quasi-\njudicial immunity and qualified immunity. As for the state tort claims, the Trustees\nargued, among other things, that they were entitled to the immunities provided by\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9, and that the negligence claim was\nadditionally deficient because it did not allege the existence of liability under the Tort\nClaims Act.\n       Raising some of the same arguments, the Trustees demurred to multiple claims set\nforth in the TAC.\n       Both matters were heard on September 12, 2013.\n       With respect to the demurrer, the trial court rejected the Government Code\nimmunity defenses on the grounds that they applied only to discretionary policy\ndecisions, and that the debarment at issue was nothing more than an operational decision.\nThe demurrer was sustained with leave to amend with respect to the negligence claim so\n\n                                             10\n\fthat the FTR Parties could allege a statutory basis for liability under the Tort Claims Act.\nIn all other respects, the demurrer was overruled. The anti-SLAPP motion was denied.\n       The District and Trustees appealed.10\n                                      DISCUSSION11\nI. Standard of Review.\n       The denial of an anti-SLAPP motion is reviewed de novo. (Schwarzburd v.\nKensington Police Protection & Community Services Dist. Bd. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th\n1345, 1350 (Schwarzburd).) The propriety of an award of attorney fees is reviewed for\nan abuse of discretion (Baharian-Mehr v. Smith (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 265, 275), but\n“the determination of whether the trial court had the statutory authority to make such an\naward is a question of law that we review de novo” (Carpenter v. Jack in the Box Corp.\n(2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 454, 460).\nII. Code of Civil Procedure Section 425.16.\n       “A cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in\nfurtherance of the person’s right of petition or free speech under the United States\nConstitution or the California Constitution” under specified categories “shall be subject\nto a special motion to strike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established\nthat there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n       As used in the anti-SLAPP statute, act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition\nor free speech includes, inter alia: (1) any written or oral statement or writing made\nbefore a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding\nauthorized by law, or (2) any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with\nan issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or any\n\n10\n       We ordered the three appeals to be consolidated.\n11\n       The District and Trustees challenge the trial court’s order granting the FTR Parties\nleave to amend their negligence claim. That order, however, was not appealable and is\nnot reviewable in connection with this appeal.\n\n\n                                              11\n\fother official proceeding authorized by law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(1)-(2);\nBriggs v. Eden Council for Hope & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106, 1123 [no\n“‘issue of public interest’” limitation].)\n       If, under the first prong of the analysis, a court determines that a cause of action\narises from protected activity, then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a\nprobability of prevailing. (Navellier v. Sletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88–89 (Navellier).)\nA claim must have at least “minimal merit[.]” (Id. at p. 89.) In determining whether\nthere is at least minimal merit, a court will consider the pleadings as well as supporting\nand opposing declarations stating the facts upon which claims or defenses are based.\nWhen assessing the declarations, a court will not weigh credibility, nor will it evaluate\nthe weight of the evidence. Rather, it will accept as true all evidence favorable to the\nplaintiff and consider the defendant’s evidence “‘only to determine if it defeats the\nplaintiff’s submission as a matter of law.’ [Citation.]” (Grewal v. Jammu (2011) 191\nCal.App.4th 977, 989.)\n       The California Supreme Court has explained that the reach of “[Code of Civil\nProcedure] section 425.16 extends to statements and writings of governmental entities\nand public officials on matters of public interest and concern that would fall within the\nscope of the statute if such statements were made by a private individual or entity.”\n(Vargas v. City of Salinas (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1, 17 (Vargas).)12\n\n\n\n\n12\n        We note that the United States Supreme Court, in Nevada Commission on Ethics\nv. Carrigan (2011) 131 S.Ct. 2343, 2350 (Carrigan), held that a restriction on how\nlegislators vote is not a restriction on their personal free speech rights. This is because\n“legislative power thus committed is not personal to the legislator but belongs to the\npeople; the legislator has no personal right to it.” (Ibid.) Given the holding in Vargas,\nCarrigan has no impact on the analysis of whether a public official’s vote is protected\nunder the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\n\n                                              12\n\fIII. In Connection With the Section 1983 Claims, the Trustees Were Sued in Their\nOfficial and Individual Capacities.\n       As a preliminary matter, we must determine the capacity in which the Trustees\nwere sued under section 1983.\n       Section 1983 provides: “Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . , subjects . . . any citizen of the United\nStates or other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at\nlaw, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action\nbrought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial\ncapacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or\ndeclaratory relief was unavailable.”\n       A public official can be sued in an official capacity, a personal capacity or both. A\npersonal-capacity suit “seek[s] to impose personal liability upon a government official for\nactions he takes under color of state law.” (Kentucky v. Graham (1985) 473 U.S. 159,\n165 (Kentucky); Pitts v. County of Kern (1998) 17 Cal.4th 340, 350 [quoting the rule set\nforth in Kentucky].) An official-capacity suit is another way of “‘pleading an action\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.’ [Citation.]” (Kentucky, supra, 473 U.S.\nat pp. 165–166.) To “establish personal liability in a [section 1983] action, it is enough to\nshow that the official, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal\nright. [Citation.] More is required in an official-capacity action, however, for a\ngovernmental entity is liable under [section 1983] only when the entity itself is a\n‘“moving force”’ behind the deprivation, [citations]; thus, in an official-capacity suit the\nentity’s ‘policy or custom’ must have played a part in the violation of federal law.\n[Citations.]” (Kentucky, supra, at p. 166, citing Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social\nServices (1978) 436 U.S. 658, 694.)\n       Because a state is not a person under section 1983, an official capacity claim\nagainst a state does not lie for damages. But an official capacity claim for prospective\nrelief will lie because, under sovereign immunity doctrine, such a claim is not treated as\n\n                                               13\n\fagainst the state. (Will v. Michigan Department of State Police (1989) 491 U.S. 58, 64–\n69, 71, fn. 10.) A damages action against a California school district is considered an\naction against the state. (Kirchmann v. Lake Elsinore Unified School Dist. (2000) 83\nCal.App.4th 1098, 1110; Mitchell v. Los Angeles Community College District (9th Cir.\n1988) 861 F.2d 198, 201–202.)\n       “In many cases, the complaint will not clearly specify whether officials are sued\npersonally, in their official capacity, or both. ‘The course of proceedings’ in such cases\ntypically will indicate the nature of the liability sought to be imposed. [Citation.]”\n(Kentucky, supra, 473 U.S. at p. 167, fn. 14.)\n       Turning to the FAC, we note that the procedural due process claim and the prayer\ndid not allege the capacity in which the Trustees were sued, but it is apparent they were\nsued in both their individual and official capacities because the claim sought damages\n(only recoverable against the Trustees in their individual capacities) and injunctive relief\n(only obtainable against the Board). (Hafer v. Melo (1991) 502 U.S. 21, 22–23, 27 [a\npublic official sued in his or her personal capacity under section 1983 can be held liable\nfor damages arising from their official acts]; Ahanotu v. Massachusetts Turnpike Auth.\n(D. Mass. 2006) 466 F.Supp.2d 378, 398 [“An individual acting in his or her official\ncapacity may be sued for prospective injunctive relief to end an ongoing constitutional\nviolation, or can be sued in his or her individual capacity for money\ndamages”];17A Moore’s Federal Practice - Civil (2015) § 123.40[b][1] (Matthew\nBender) [“even if the officer performed official functions when the alleged harm\noccurred, the suit is an individual-capacity suit if the plaintiff seeks a damage award\nagainst the officer personally”].)13\n\n\n13\n        In connection with their argument concerning the first section 1983 claim, the\nTrustees cite Brunius v. Parrish (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 838 (Brunius) for the\nproposition that official actions do not support individual capacity claims. However,\nBrunius did not decide that issue because it was forfeited (id. at p. 859), and cases are not\nauthority for issues not decided. (Consumers Lobby Against Monopolies v. Public\nUtilities Com. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 891, 902.)\n\n\n                                             14\n\f       The First Amendment retaliation claim, which was first set forth in the TAC,\nalleged that FTR and Katbi are entitled “to general and compensatory damages\n. . . against each defendant in his or her individual capacity, and injunctive and\ndeclaratory relief against each individual defendant in his or her official capacity.” The\npleading was unequivocal. The Trustees were sued in both their individual and official\ncapacities.14\nIV. The Personal Capacity Section 1983 Claims.\n       A. No Forfeiture of Issues Raised Below; No Forfeiture of Legal Issues.\n       In their first anti-SLAPP motion, the District and Trustees argued that FTR Parties\nwere trying to chill future speech and conduct, the District was not a person subject to\nliability under section 1983, and the Trustees were entitled to qualified immunity for their\nactions. Only in their reply brief did the District and Trustees argue that the protected\nactivity supporting the anti-SLAPP motion was the conduct of the Trustees in connection\nwith the debarment proceedings, and that the Trustees were entitled to absolute quasi-\njudicial immunity. The trial court considered both of those arguments to be forfeited\nbecause they were not asserted in the moving papers.\n       FTR urges us to disregard the same arguments the trial court refused to consider.\nWe decline. Our review is de novo, and the issues raised in the papers below have been\nfully briefed on appeal. Regardless, we have the discretion to consider all legal issues\nraised by the parties for the first time on appeal. (Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc.\n(2014 ) 223 Cal.App.4th 1309, 1324.)\n\n\n\n\n14\n        With respect to the second section 1983 claim, the Trustees cite our opinion in\nMcAllister v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1198 (McAllister)\nto establish that the TAC did not allege an individual capacity claim. But in McAllister,\nthe appellant did not argue that the form of relief sought—and whether it was obtainable\nagainst the public official or the state—was a relevant inquiry, so we did not analyze that\nissue. In the case at bar, we are confronted with that issue and conclude that the relief\nsought is a relevant inquiry when determining whether a public official has been sued in\nhis or her official or individual capacity, or both.\n\n                                             15\n\f       B. The Anti-SLAPP Statute Applies to the Personal Capacity Claims.\n              1. The Personal Capacity Claims Arise Out of the Trustees’ Protected\nActivity of Casting Votes.\n       With respect to the First Amendment retaliation claim, the parties agree that the\npersonal capacity claim arises out of the Trustees’ votes to debar the FTR Parties.\nHowever, they debate whether the procedural due process claim also arises out of the\nTrustees’ votes, and they debate whether the votes of public officials qualify as protected\nactivity under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n       We turn, first, to the basis of the procedural due process claim. This requires us to\npinpoint the claim’s principal thrust. (Martinez v. Metabolife Internat., Inc. (2003) 113\nCal.App.4th 181, 188.)\n       As to each Trustee, the FAC generally alleged that the Trustees “violated the due\nprocess rights of FTR . . . , not only by voting on February 8, 2012[,] to find [FTR] to be\nnon-responsible bidders and debar them from bidding on [District] projects but by acting\narbitrarily and without factual or legal justification to bar them for 5 years rather than the\n3-year period recommended by the Board’s committee that presided over the evidentiary\nhearing on the charges against FTR[.]” In addition, the FAC averred that in the process\nof debarring FTR, the Board and Trustees denied FTR due process by, among other\nactions, (1) harboring actual bias toward FTR; (2) making arbitrary decisions; and\n(3) making findings and conclusions in a manner that amended the debarment charges\nwithout first affording FTR the chance to respond to the amended charges. All of these\nallegations were incorporated by reference into the claim for violation of procedural due\nprocess.\n       As to damages, the procedural due process claim alleged: “As a direct and\nproximate result of defendants’ unlawful actions as alleged herein, plaintiffs have\nincurred and will incur economic damage and losses, lost business opportunity, damage\nto professional and personal reputation, and plaintiff Katbi has suffered severe emotional\ndistress and other injuries, thus entitling plaintiffs to general and compensatory damages\nin amounts to be proven at trial.” The claim also alleged that the FTR Parties were\n\n                                              16\n\fentitled to punitive damages because the Trustees acted in conscious disregard of the\nFTR Parties’ rights.\n       The FTR Parties contend that the principal thrust of this claim is that the Trustees\ndenied them procedural due process in connection with the hearing, processing and\ndeciding of the three charges. We disagree. The Trustees’ votes are what led to FTR\nbeing debarred for five years and suffering damages. (Vergos v. McNeal (2007) 146\nCal.App.4th 1387, 1397 (Vergos) [cause of action arose out of hearing officer’s\n“communicative conduct in denying plaintiff’s grievances”].) Moreover, the “hearing,\nprocessing and deciding of the [debarment issues was] meaningless without a\ncommunication of the adverse results.” (Ibid. [rejecting the trial court’s rationale that a\ncause of action did not arise from protected activity because it was based on a hearing\nofficer’s “conduct and not on the content of what she stated in any proceeding or in the\nexercise of the right to petition”].)\n       It is relevant to note that a plaintiff suing on a section 1983 claim may not,\ngenerally speaking, obtain a compensatory damages award absent actual injury. (Farrar\nv. Hobby (1992) 506 U.S. 103, 112.) However, a plaintiff may sue for nominal damages\nwhen it has been denied procedural due process. (Ibid.) “The awarding of nominal\ndamages for the ‘absolute’ right to procedural due process ‘recognizes the importance to\norganized society that [this] right be scrupulously observed’ while ‘remaining true to the\nprinciple that substantial damages should be awarded only to compensate actual injury.’\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.) Because this personal capacity claim seeks compensatory rather than\nnominal damages against the Trustees, it is apparent that the FTR Parties’ main focus is\ncompensation for actual injury caused by the votes rather than, for the sake of principle,\nan attack on how the debarment hearing was conducted.15 To bolster our point, we note\n\n\n15\n        A debarment proceeding implicates a liberty interest. (Southern Cal.\nUnderground Contractors, Inc. v. City of San Diego (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 533, 542\n(Underground Contractors).) In essence, the FTR Parties claim that they were deprived\nof that interest by the debarment.\n\n\n                                             17\n\fthat the FTR Parties did not sue Trustee Field even though she contributed to the denial\nof procedural due process\n       Next, we resolve whether the Trustees’ votes are protected activity under Code of\nCivil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (e).\n       The answer is provided by Schwarzburd. It held that board members of a public\nagency who were sued because of how they voted were entitled to the protections of the\nanti-SLAPP statute. (Schwarzburd, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1354–1355.) Under\nthe clear import of Schwarsburd, the Trustees’ votes are, indeed, protected activity.\nUrging us to find against anti-SLAPP protection, the FTR Parties rely on City of\nMontebello v. Vasquez (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1084 (Montebello). In Montebello, the\ncourt held that a city council member’s votes and acts of governance, without more, are\nnot exercises of free speech or petition and therefore do not fall within the scope of the\nanti-SLAPP statute. (Id. at p. 1092.) The FTR Parties’ reliance is misplaced. On August\n13, 2014, our Supreme Court granted a request to depublish Montebello at the same time\nthat it denied a request to depublish Schwarzburd. (City of Montebello v. Vasquez (2014)\n330 P.3d 329 [175 Cal.Rptr.3d 252]; Schwarzburd v. Kensington Police Protection &\nCommunity Services Dist. Bd. (Aug. 13, 2014, S219175) ___ Cal.4th ___ [2014 Cal.\nLexis 5520].) Given that our Supreme Court has depublished Montebello, it is not\npermissible for us to consider that opinion.\n              2. Public Policy Does not Bar the Application of the Anti-SLAPP Statute to\nthe Personal Capacity Claims.\n       Even if the votes would otherwise fit within the scope of the language in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (e), the FTR Parties argue that public policy\ndictates that the anti-SLAPP statute have no application. In their view, applying the anti-\nSLAPP statute here would encourage public officials to insulate their wrongful actions by\nhaving a local political body vote to approve of their misconduct. This argument fails\nbecause the damage would flow from the misconduct, not the vote, and the anti-SLAPP\nstatute would not be triggered by the artifice of that vote.\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f       Alternatively, the FTR Parties argue that protecting the votes of public officials\nwould chill the right of citizens to challenge unlawful government conduct, and for that\nreason the anti-SLAPP statute should not apply. But the cases cited by the FTR Parties—\nUSA Waste of California, Inc. v. City of Irwindale (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 53 (USA\nWaste) and Graffiti Protective Coatings, Inc. v. City of Pico Rivera (2010)\n181 Cal.App.4th 1207 (Graffiti Protective Coatings)—are inapposite because they\ninvolved actions against public entities rather than public officials and therefore were\nimpacted by different policy considerations.\n       USA Waste noted that “[a]ctions to enforce, interpret or invalidate governmental\nlaws generally are not subject to being stricken under the anti-SLAPP statute. If they\nwere, efforts to challenge governmental action would be burdened significantly.” (USA\nWaste, supra, 184 Cal.App.4th at p. 65.) Citing San Ramon Valley Fire Protection Dist.\nv. Contra Costa County Employees’ Retirement Assn. (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 343, 357–\n358 (San Ramon), Graffiti Protective Coatings pointed out that “if a special motion to\nstrike could be brought in every case where a petition for mandate seeks to challenge a\ngovernment decision, then suits to compel public entities to comply with the law would\nbe chilled.” (Graffiti Protective Coatings, supra, 181 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1219–1220.)\nSan Ramon involved a suit by a fire protection district challenging a decision by a\nretirement board to increase contributions to support increased benefits. It held that the\nretirement board’s action did not constitute protected activity, reasoning: “To decide\notherwise would significantly burden the petition rights of those seeking mandamus\nreview for most types of governmental action. Many of the public entity decisions\nreviewable by mandamus or administrative mandamus are arrived at after discussion and\na vote at a public meeting. [Citations.] If mandamus petitions challenging decisions\nreached in this manner were routinely subject to a special motion to strike . . . [,] the\npetitioners in every such case could be forced to make a prima facie showing of merit at\nthe pleading stage. While that result might not go so far as to impliedly repeal the\nmandamus statutes . . . , it would chill the resort to legitimate judicial oversight over\npotential abuses of legislative and administrative power, which is at the heart of those\n\n                                              19\n\fremedial statutes. It would also ironically impose an undue burden upon the very right of\npetition for those seeking mandamus review in a manner squarely contrary to the\nunderlying legislative intent behind [Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16.”\n(San Ramon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 357.)\n       Giving anti-SLAPP protection to the votes of public officials as opposed to the\naction of a public entity will not chill the ability of citizens to challenge governmental\naction. Under USA Waste, Graffiti Protective Coatings and San Ramon, public entities\ncan still be sued without the burden of the anti-SLAPP statute. Thus, we decline to strip\npublic officials of anti-SLAPP protection.\n              3. The Illegality Exception Does not Apply.\n       The FTR Parties urge us to conclude that the anti-SLAPP statute does not protect\nunconstitutional votes. They rely on Flatley v. Mauro (2006) 39 Cal.4th 299, 320\n(Flatley), which stated that “where a defendant brings a motion to strike under [Code of\nCivil Procedure] section 425.16 based on a claim that the plaintiff’s action arises from\nactivity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant’s exercise of protected speech or\npetition rights, but either the defendant concedes, or the evidence conclusively\nestablishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter\nof law, the defendant is precluded from using the anti-SLAPP statute to strike the\nplaintiff’s action.” As a counterpunch, the Trustees claim that the Flatley rule applies\nonly to criminal conduct.\n       We agree with the Trustees.\n       Our Supreme Court has not elucidated whether the illegality exception is limited\nto criminal conduct, or whether it can be extended to noncriminal conduct that is\nunlawful in the sense that it violates a principle of constitutional, statutory or common\nlaw. However, as observed in Fremont Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin (2011)\n198 Cal.App.4th 1153, 1169 (Fremont Reorganizing), multiple “Court of Appeal\nopinions have rejected attempts to apply the rule from Flatley . . . to noncriminal\nconduct.” The court concluded that the rule from Flatley “is limited to criminal\nconduct.” (Fremont Reorganizing, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) One of the\n\n                                              20\n\fdecisions cited was Mendoza v. ADP Screening & Selection Services, Inc. (2010)\n182 Cal.App.4th 1644 (Mendoza). It concluded that “the Supreme Court’s use of the\nphrase ‘illegal’ [in Flatley] was intended to mean criminal, and not merely violative of a\nstatute.” (Mendoza, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1654.) The Mendoza court added that\n“a reading of Flatley to push any statutory violation outside the reach of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute would greatly weaken the constitutional interests which the statute is designed to\nprotect. As [the defendant] correctly observes, a plaintiff’s complaint always alleges a\ndefendant engaged in illegal conduct in that it violated some common law standard of\nconduct or statutory prohibition, giving rise to liability, and we decline to give plaintiffs a\ntool for avoiding the application of the anti-SLAPP statute merely by showing any\nstatutory violation.” (Mendoza, supra, at p. 1654.)\n       We conclude that the reasoning in Fremont Reorganizing and Mendoza is sound,\nand that those cases should be followed.\n              4. The Anti-SLAPP Statute is not Preempted by the Supremacy Clause.\n       The FTR Parties contend that that application of the anti-SLAPP statute to the\nfederal civil rights claims is barred by conflict and obstacle preemption. This contention\ndoes not withstand scrutiny.\n       “The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes a\nconstitutional choice-of-law rule, makes federal law paramount, and vests Congress with\nthe power to preempt state law. [Citations.]” (Viva! Internat. Voice for Animals v.\nAddidas Promotional Retail Operations, Inc. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 929, 935 (Viva!).)\nConflict preemption is triggered “when simultaneous compliance with both state and\nfederal directives is impossible. [Citations.]” (Viva!, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 936.)\nObstacle preemption arises in a particular case when a state law frustrates the objectives\nof Congress. (Ibid.)\n       There is no conflict preemption here. The anti-SLAPP statute prescribes no\nprocedures for debarment hearings, and therefore it does not make it impossible for the\nTrustees to comply with either the requirements of procedural due process when\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fconducting debarment hearings or the requirements of section 1983. The FTR Parties\noffer no argument to the contrary.\n       This brings us to obstacle preemption.\n       Congress enacted section 1983 “in response to the patent inadequacy of state\nenforcement of constitutional guarantees for the newly enfranchised black citizenry.”\n(Williams v. Horvath (1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, 841 (Williams).) Its purpose is “to serve as\nan antidote to discriminatory state laws, to protect federal rights where state law is\ninadequate, and to protect federal rights where state processes are available in theory but\nnot in practice[.]” (Ibid.) This purpose “may not be frustrated by state substantive\nlimitations couched in procedural language.” (Ibid.; County of Los Angeles v. Superior\nCourt (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 8, 17 [“Although federal law controls the substantive\naspects of plaintiffs’ federal civil rights claim, state rules of evidence and procedure\napply unless application of those rules would affect plaintiffs’ substantive federal\nrights”].) For example, the Williams court held that the claim filing requirement in the\nGovernment Tort Claims Act “is inoperative in an action brought under section 1983”\nbecause that provision “‘is more than a procedural requirement, it is a condition\nprecedent to [the plaintiff] maintaining an action against [the] defendants[,]’” and is “‘an\nintegral part of [the] plaintiff’s cause of action.’” (Williams, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 842.)\n       California appellate courts have held that the anti-SLAPP statute is applicable to\nclaims brought in state court pursuant to section 1983. (Vergos, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 1392, fn. 4 [“Federal civil rights claims brought in California state courts are subject\nto [Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16 motions”]; Bradbury v. Superior Court (1996)\n49 Cal.App.4th 1108, 1117–1118 [holding that Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16 applies to a\nfederal civil rights cause of action, and rejecting the argument that Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 425.16 “violates federal substantive law”].) We opt to follow the lead of prior Court of\nAppeal decisions because an anti-SLAPP motion is neither a condition precedent to nor\nan integral part of a lawsuit under section 1983.\n\n\n\n\n                                              22\n\f       To combat California precedent, the FTR Parties cite federal cases that relied on\nan Erie16 doctrine analysis or the preemptive effect of the Bankruptcy Code when holding\nthat the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply to federal claims in federal court. (Globetrotter\nSoftware, Inc. v. Elan Computer Group, Inc. (N.D. Cal. 1999) 63 F.Supp.2d 1127, 1128–\n1130 [under the Erie doctrine, the anti-SLAPP statute applies to pendant state claims but\nnot federal claims brought in federal court]; Bulletin Displays, LLC v. Regency Outdoor\nAdver., Inc. (C.D. Cal. 2006) 448 F. Supp. 2d 1172, 1182 (Bulletin Displays) [same];17\nRestaino v. Bah (In re Bah) (Bankr. 9th Cir. 2005) 321 B.R. 41, 46 [impliedly holding\nthat the Bankruptcy Code preempts the application of the anti-SLAPP statute to federal\nclaims in bankruptcy court]; Riese v. County of Del Norte (case No. 12 CV-03723-WHO,\nN.D. Cal. 2013) 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 126351 [the anti-SLAPP statute inapplicable to\nfederal claims in federal court].) Because the Erie doctrine and the Bankruptcy Code are\nnot implicated, these cases are inapposite.\n              5. The Fourteenth Amendment Does not Prevent Anti-SLAPP Protection.\n       The FTR Parties argue that conduct cannot be simultaneously protected by the\nFirst Amendment and prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment and, as a consequence,\nthe Trustees cannot invoke the anti-SLAPP statute. Impliedly, they suggest that the anti-\n\n16\n       Erie R.R. v. Tompkins (1938) 304 U.S. 64 (Erie).\n17\n        In Bulletin Displays, the defendant argued that the “failure to apply the anti-\nSLAPP statute to federal causes of action that could also be brought in state court would\ncontravene Erie’s holding that, in a diversity suit, state substantive law must be applied to\nprevent ‘forum shopping.’” (Bulletin Displays, supra, 448 F.Supp.2d at p. 1181.) The\ncourt rejected this argument because Erie “has no application to federal question claims,\nonly to state law claims in diversity actions and pendent state law claims in federal\nquestion cases.” (Ibid.) In dicta, the court stated without deciding, “Moreover, as the\nanti-SLAPP statute has been described as establishing a rule of ‘substance,’ rather than\nprocedure, [New.Net, Inc. v. Lavasoft (C.D. Cal. 2004) 356 F.Supp.2d 1090, 1099\n(New.Net)], applying it to federal claims arguably would permit state law to affect and\nalter the substance of federal claims in violation of the Supremacy Clause of the\nConstitution.” (Bulletion Displays, supra, 448 F.Supp.2d at pp. 1181–1182.) This dicta\nis not persuasive because New.Net was an Erie doctrine case, and it therefore does not\nsupport a finding that the anti-SLAPP statute is substantive under a preemption analysis.\n(New.Net, supra, 356 F.Supp.2d at p. 1099.)\n\n                                              23\n\fSLAPP statute does not apply because the Trustees’ votes have been stripped of First\nAmendment protection by the Fourteenth Amendment. They make this argument in\nconnection with their discussion of preemption, yet this cannot possibly be a preemption\nissue because it does not involve a conflict between state and federal law. Rather, as\nposed, it involves a conflict between two amendments to the United States Constitution.\nWe therefore address this issue separately.\n       In support of their novel argument, the FTR Parties cite a single case, United\nStates v. Yonkers (2nd Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 444, 457 (Yonkers). In Yonkers, city council\nmembers were held in contempt of court for failing to vote in compliance with an order\ndirecting the city to adopt legislation designed to remedy racial segregation in housing\nand schools. (Yonkers, supra, 856 F.2d at pp. 447–452.) On appeal, the city council\nmembers asserted a First Amendment defense. The Yonkers court rejected the defense,\nstating: “Even if we acknowledge that the act of voting has sufficient expressive content\nto be accorded some First Amendment protection as symbolic speech, the public interest\nin obtaining compliance with federal court judgments that remedy constitutional\nviolations unquestionably justifies whatever burden on expression has occurred.\n[Citation.] The council members remain free to express their views on all aspects of\nhousing in Yonkers. But just as the First Amendment would not permit them to incite\nviolation of federal law, [citations], it does not permit them to take action in violation of\nsuch law[.]” (Yonkers, supra, at p. 457.)\n       We find nothing in Yonkers that is relevant here. It does not stand for the\nproposition that a state statute cannot require a prima facie showing of merit before a\nclaim arising from certain categories of speech goes forward. Rather, Yonkers simply\nestablishes that the First Amendment will not be a defense if policy demands that free\nspeech rights yield to other considerations.\n       C. There is no Probability of Prevailing on the Procedural Due Process Claim.\n       The Trustees contend that they are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to\nthe due process claim. This contention bears out.\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f       “[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded\nfrom liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly\nestablished statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\nknown. [Citations.]” (Harlow v. Fitzgerald (1982) 457 U.S. 800, 818.) “Qualified\nimmunity balances two important interests—the need to hold public officials accountable\nwhen they exercise power irresponsibly and the need to shield officials from harassment,\ndistraction, and liability when they perform their duties reasonably. The protection of\nqualified immunity applies regardless of whether the government official’s error is ‘a\nmistake of law, a mistake of fact, or a mistake based on mixed questions of law and fact.’\n[Citation.]” (Pearson v. Callahan (2009) 555 U.S. 223, 231.)\n       When examining qualified immunity, a court must determine whether the state of\nthe law at the time of the constitutional deprivation gave officials fair warning that\nparticular conduct was unconstitutional. (Ellins v. City of Sierra Madre (9th Cir. 2013)\n710 F.3d 1049, 1064 (Ellins); Eng v. Cooley (9th Cir. 2009) 552 F.3d 1062, 1075 [“For a\nconstitutional right to be clearly established, ‘its contours “must be sufficiently clear that\na reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right”’ at the\ntime of his conduct”].)\n       California case law provides that the standard of impartiality required at an\nadministrative hearing is less exacting than what is required in a judicial proceeding.\n(Nasha v. City of Los Angeles (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 470, 483 (Nasha).) According to\nNasha, “It is recognized that ‘administrative decision makers are drawn from the\ncommunity at large. Especially in a small town setting they are likely to have knowledge\nof and contact or dealings with parties to the proceeding. Holding them to the same\nstandard as judges, without a showing of actual bias or the probability of actual bias, may\ndiscourage persons willing to serve and may deprive the administrative process of\ncapable decision makers.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Thus, “in order to prevail on a claim of\nbias violating fair hearing requirements,” a plaintiff “must establish ‘“an unacceptable\nprobability of actual bias on the part of those who have actual decisionmaking power\nover their claims.”’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n                                              25\n\f       In Underground Contractors, the court explained, “‘[B]ias in an administrative\nhearing context can never be implied, and the mere suggestion or appearance of bias is\nnot sufficient. [Citation.] It is also well established that a party is not denied an impartial\nadjudicator merely because an administrative entity performs both the functions of\nprosecutor and judge. [Citation.] Overlapping investigatory, prosecutorial and\nadjudicatory functions do not necessarily deny a fair hearing and are common before\nmost administrative boards. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Underground Contractors, supra,\n108 Cal.App.4th at p. 549.) With these considerations in mind, the Underground\nContractors court held that city council members who were presiding over a debarment\nhearing were not per se biased because the contractor had sued the city. The court noted\nthat the city council members had no pecuniary interest in the lawsuit, and it concluded\nby stating that when “‘an administrative body has a duty to act, and is the only entity\ncapable of acting, the fact that the body may have an interest in the result does not\ndisqualify it from acting. The rule of necessity precludes a claim of bias from the\nstructure of the process.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 550.)\n       Given Nasha and Underground Contractors, and given the absence of any cases\nprohibiting the Trustees from presiding over a debarment hearing in this factual context,\nthey contend that they could not have known that authorizing a cross-complaint in the\nHickman Action disqualified them from presiding over the debarment hearing. The FTR\nParties, on the other hand, contend that the Trustees violated the clearly established rule\nthat a contractor facing debarment has a constitutional right to an impartial decision\nmaker. (Golden Day School, Inc. v. State Dept. of Education (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 695,\n709 (Golden Day).)\n       There was no evidence of actual bias presented in connection with the first anti-\nSLAPP motion, which predated the First Amendment retaliation claim. At most, this is a\n“probability of bias” case. While there is a general rule set forth in Golden Day requiring\nthat a decision maker be impartial, there are no state or federal cases, nor are there any\nstatutes, specifically on point. The emergent question, then, is whether the Trustees\nshould have known that procedural due process required that they recuse themselves from\n\n                                              26\n\fthe debarment hearing because there was an unacceptable probability of bias. We think\nnot. They are called upon to conduct the District’s business and make decisions about\ncontractors and projects. Undeniably, they have overlapping investigatory and\nadjudicatory function. Per the Underground Contractors court, such an overlapping of\nfunction does not necessarily deny a fair hearing. Significantly, as that case establishes,\nlitigation between a public agency and an administrative litigant does not disqualify the\npublic agency from acting. Assuming without deciding that constitutional law required\nthe Trustees to disqualify themselves, it goes too far to charge the Trustees with that\nknowledge. If they made a mistake of law, it was not so obvious as to defeat qualified\nimmunity. This is because the precise contours of due process in the administrative\ncontext are flexible and ever evolving.\n       We reach the same conclusion regarding the Trustees’ failure to rule on\naffirmative defenses. The FTR Parties have not cited any cases that required a ruling,\nand we are aware of none. A review of the administrative record reveals that they were\npermitted to present evidence on their affirmative defenses, and the Trustees voted based\non the entire record. This procedure allowed the FTR Parties to preserve their affirmative\ndefenses for judicial review. While the FTR Parties were entitled to procedural\nsafeguards, “there [was] no constitutional entitlement to the full panoply of judicial trial\nprocedures” (Underground Contractors, supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at pp. 542–543). Thus,\nassuming the law required a ruling on the affirmative defenses, the Trustees cannot be\ncharged with anticipating such a rule.\n       D. There is a Probability of Prevailing on the Retaliation Claim.\n       When a plaintiff sues public officials under section 1983 and alleges retaliation for\nthe exercise of First Amendment rights, the plaintiff “must establish that (1) it engaged in\nexpressive conduct that addressed a matter of public concern; (2) the government\nofficials took an adverse action against it; and (3) its expressive conduct was a substantial\nor motivating factor for the adverse action. [Citation.]” (Alpha Energy Savers, Inc. v.\nHansen (9th Cir. 2004) 381 F.3d 917, 923 (Alpha).)\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\f              1. Expressive Conduct that Addressed a Matter of Public Concern.\n       Whether “speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the\ncontent, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.”\n(Connick v. Myers (1983) 461 U.S. 138, 147, 148 [stating test for analyzing “[w]hether\nan employee’s speech addresses a matter of public concern”].) Speech involves matters\nof public concern when it relates to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the\ncommunity, or when it is a subject of legitimate news interest. (Lane v. Franks (2014)\n134 S.Ct. 2369, 2380; Snyder v. Phelps (2011) 562 U.S. 443, 452 [131 S.Ct. 1207, 1216]\n[“[s]peech deals with matters of public concern when it can ‘be fairly considered as\nrelating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community,’” or when it\n“‘is a subject of legitimate news interest’”].) “On the other hand, speech that deals with\n‘individual personnel disputes and grievances’ and that would be of ‘no relevance to the\npublic’s evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies’ is generally not of\n‘public concern.’ [Citation.]” (Coszalter v. City of Salem (9th Cir. 2003) 320 F.3d 968,\n973 (Coszalter).)\n       When government employees speak about corruption, wrongdoing, misconduct or\nwastefulness by other government employees, that speech is a matter of public concern.\n(Alpha, supra, 381 F.3d at p. 926.) This “rule applies to invidious discrimination as\nwell—whether it consists of a single act or a pattern of conduct. Disputes over racial,\nreligious, or other such discrimination by public officials are not simply individual\npersonnel matters. They involve the type of governmental conduct that affects the\nsocietal interest as a whole—conduct in which the public has a deep and abiding interest.\nLitigation seeking to expose such wrongful governmental activity is, by its very nature, a\nmatter of public concern.” (Id. at pp. 926–927.)\n       We conclude that Katbi’s letter dated October 5, 2011, was a matter of public\nconcern because it sought to expose racism, retaliation, corruption and fraud by Payinda\nin connection with a public project, and because it accused the District of acting in bad\nfaith when rejecting a low bid. Also, the letter responded to newspaper articles, which\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fdemonstrated that the topic of the FTR Parties’ reputation and performance on public\ncontracts was newsworthy.\n              2. Adverse Action.\n       The trustees voted to debar the FTR Parties. That qualifies as adverse action\nbecause it is reasonably likely to deter their complaints about government corruption and\nmisconduct. (Coszalter, supra, 320 F.3d at p. 970 [in a First Amendment retaliation case,\nan adverse action “is an act that is reasonably likely to deter” a person “from engaging in\nconstitutionally protected speech”].)\n       The Trustees contend that due to the trial court’s decision to grant the petition for\nwrit of mandate and undo the debarment, there is no official action upon which the FTR\nParties’ claim can be based. They cite Martinez v. California (1980) 444 U.S. 277\n(Martinez) and Ketchum v. County of Alameda (9th Cir. 1987) 811 F.2d 1243 (Ketchum)\nbut neither case is apposite.\n       In Martinez, a teenage girl was murdered by a parolee. Her survivors sued the\nparole board under section 1983 and alleged that when it released the parolee, it subjected\nthe girl to a deprivation of life without due process of law. The court rejected the theory\non the grounds that the girl’s death was too remote a consequence of the parole board’s\nactions. In particular, the court noted that the parolee was not an agent of the parole\nboard, and the parole board was not aware that the girl faced any special danger.\n(Martinez, supra, 444 U.S. at pp. 284–285.)\n       After the plaintiff in Ketchum was raped by an inmate who escaped from a\nrehabilitation facility, she sued various entities and officers under section 1983. She\nclaimed that they were grossly negligent in failing to maintain security, and they\ntherefore deprived her of the constitutional right to privacy and security of property.\n(Ketchum, supra, 811 F.2d at p. 1244.) Citing Martinez, the Ketchum court held the\nplaintiff did not have a viable federal civil rights claim because the state did not deprive\nher of a constitutional right. (Ketchum, supra, at p. 1247.)\n       The Trustees’ votes led directly to the FTR Parties’ injuries, so it cannot\nreasonably be argued that their actions were too remote. In reaching this conclusion, we\n\n                                             29\n\freject the Trustees’ suggestion that they cannot be held liable because it was the District\nthat debarred FTR, not them. It was explained in Gilbrook v. City of Westminster (9th\nCir. 1999) 177 F.3d 839, 854 (Gilbrook) that anyone who causes a citizen to be subjected\nto a constitutional deprivation is liable under section 1983. The “‘requisite causal\nconnection can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in\nthe deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor\nknows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.’\n[Citation.]” (Gilbrook, supra, 177 F.3d at p. 854.)\n       To the degree the Trustees suggest that the writ of mandate erases any misconduct,\nthe suggestion lacks legal support.\n              3. Substantial or Motivating Factor.\n       Federal law establishes that to prove that First Amendment “retaliation was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor behind an adverse employment action, a plaintiff may\nintroduce evidence that (1) the speech and adverse action were proximate in time, such\nthat a jury could infer that the action took place in retaliation for the speech; (2) the\nemployer expressed opposition to the speech, either to the speaker or to others; or (3) the\nproffered explanations for the adverse action were false and pretextual.” (Ellins, supra,\n710 F.3d at p. 1062.)\n       Here, in a letter dated October 17, 2011, the District notified FTR and Katbi that\nthe Board would be holding a hearing in December 2011 to determine whether to debar\nthem for up to five years. That letter was issued soon after Katbi’s October 5, 2011,\nletter. On January 10, 2012, after a hearing, the Trustees’ committee recommended\ndebarment. Less than a month later, the Trustees voted to debar FTR for five years.\nBecause the District’s letter, the recommendation and the debarment were so close in\ntime to Katbi’s letter, a jury could infer that the decision to hold a hearing and consider\ndebarment was retaliation for Katbi’s speech. (Coszalter, supra, 320 F.3d at p. 978\n[adverse action taking place three to eight months after the plaintiff speech supports an\ninference of retaliation].)\n       Other facts bolster the inference of retaliation.\n\n                                              30\n\f         For example, the committee report stated: “FTR . . . argues that it was targeted by\n[Payinda] and that [Payinda] made racist remarks about FTR including referring to it as\n‘sand niggers and towel heads.’ The Committee finds such language patently offensive\nand inexcusable. [Payinda], the person who FTR alleges said such things, vehemently\ndenies he ever made such comments. . . . The Committee also notes that FTR made the\nexact same allegations on another public works project for the Rio School District in\nOxnard, California[,] which took place over 10 years ago. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] While the\nDistrict would never condone any racist conduct, it is difficult for the Committee to\nbelieve that on two completely separate projects in two different counties and years apart,\ntwo different persons would undertake to reject work and harass FTR based solely on\nracial bias[,] and that these two persons would use identical racist remarks against FTR.\nHowever distasteful such comments are, what is also distasteful is a contractor’s apparent\npractice of using the allegation of racism to deflect responsibility for the quality of its\nwork.” Thus, it is apparent that the committee expressed opposition to some of Katbi’s\nstatements.\n         Furthermore, in the context of the other facts mentioned, the Board conducted the\ndebarment proceeding in a manner suggesting that it stacked the deck against the FTR\nParties. It refused a continuance that would have enabled the FTR Parties to prepare an\nexpert regarding charge III; at the committee hearing on January 10, 2012, the committee\nmembers failed to discuss the elements of fraud; the committee members refused to rule\non the affirmative defenses; and the Trustees voted to debar for five years instead of\nfollowing the committee recommendation that the FTR Parties be debarred for only three\nyears.\n         To block our consideration of the letter, the Trustees cite Continental Ins. Co. v.\nLexington Ins. Co. (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 637, 646 [a plaintiff is not “allowed to amend\nthe complaint to state a fact directly contradictory to one stated previously”], Vallejo\nDevelopment Co. v. Beck Development Co. (1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 929, 946 [“a court is\n“‘not bound to accept as true allegations contrary to factual allegations in former pleading\nin the same case”’”], and Deveny v. Entropin, Inc. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 408, 425–426\n\n                                               31\n\f[allegations in the original complaint rendering it vulnerable to demurrer cannot be\nomitted without explanation]. According to the Trustees, the FAC and the TAC are\nfatally inconsistent regarding the motive for debarment, i.e., whether it was motivated by\nthe Los Angeles Times articles or Katbi’s letter.\n       We perceive no inconsistency. The FAC alleged facts related to the Los Angeles\nTimes articles, but it did not allege that the debarment was motivated by those articles.\nAt most, the FAC could be construed as implying that the articles were a motivating\nfactor. That does not contradict the allegation in the TAC that the debarment was\nretaliation for Katbi’s letter. The Trustees’ real complaint seems to be that the TAC is\ninconsistent with the FTR Parties’ ex parte application for a temporary restraining order/\ninjunction and motion for peremptory writ, in which they argued that the articles\nprompted an investigation, and that the Board debarred the FTR Parties to obtain good\npress. But the Trustees have cited no rule that would penalize the FTR Parties by\nforbidding them from alleging something different in a subsequently amended complaint.\nAnd, in any event, the FTR Parties never argued that the Los Angeles Times articles were\nthe only motivating factor, which allows room for additional motivating factors.\n       The Trustees’ next argument is also unavailing. They posit that there is no\nlikelihood of the FTR Parties prevailing because the evidence does not suggest that the\nDistrict’s staff was motivated by Katbi’s letter to recommend debarment proceedings.\nBut a press release from the District indicated that the Board had sent letters to two major\nDistrict contractors instituting proceedings that could potentially terminate their contracts\nwith the District’s building program. Also according to the press release, which was\nissued after Katbi’s October 5, 2011, letter was sent, the Board had instructed its\nChancellor to take whatever actions were necessary to reform the building program, root\nout mismanagement and waste, and ensure that taxpayers were getting full value for the\nmoney invested in community college campuses. From the timing of the letter, press\nrelease, debarment hearing and debarment, a jury could infer that the District’s staff\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\finitiated charges to further the Trustees’ agenda of retaliating against the FTR Parties for\nKatbi’s speech.18\n       The Trustees aver that FTR’s claim is baseless because there is no evidence that\nthey were aware of the letter. We note, however, that the letter was addressed to the\nattention of each individual Trustee. A jury would be entitled to infer that the Trustees\nknew of the letter.\n       Our task is to determine whether the FTR Parties’ claim has minimal merit.\n(Oasis West Realty, LLC v. Goldman (2011) 51 Cal.4th 811, 820 [only a cause of action\nthat arises from protected speech and “lacks even minimal merit—is a SLAPP”];\nNavellier, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 89; Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006)\n39 Cal.4th 260, 278–279.)19 Based on the law and the state of the evidence, there is\nenough to suggest First Amendment retaliation.\n              4. Defenses.\n       Even if they retaliated against the FTR Parties, the Trustees contend that they have\ntwo defenses. At this stage of the proceedings, we cannot concur.\n       If a plaintiff makes a sufficient showing of retaliation, then the burden shifts to the\ngovernment to show that it had an adequate justification for treating the plaintiff\ndifferently from other members of the general public, or that it would have taken the\nadverse action even absent the protected speech. (Robinson v. York (9th Cir. 2009)\n566 F.3d 817, 822.) The first defense is based on the balancing test in Pickering v. Board\nof Education (1968) 391 U.S. 563, 568 (Pickering), and the second defense is based on\n\n18\n        In light of our conclusion that the evidence supported a retaliation claim based on\nKatbi’s letter, we need not consider FTR’s alternative contention that the Trustees\nretaliated based on statements made by FTR at the debarment hearing.\n19\n        Because they have not cited any supporting law, we are unmoved by the Trustees’\nsuggestion that FTR should be estopped from relying on the letter in support of its claim\nbecause it did not submit the letter when it sought to enjoin the debarment hearing, and\nbecause the FAC did not allege that the letter prompted bias in the Trustees. (Nelson v.\nAvondale Homeowners Assn. (2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 857, 862 [“‘When an appellant\nfails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and\ncitations to authority, we treat the point as waived’”].)\n\n                                             33\n\fthe mixed motive test in Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle\n(1977) 429 U.S. 274, 287 (Mt. Healthy).\n       Pursuant to the Pickering defense, a court must balance the right of a person to\nmake statements against the interest of the state, as an employer, in promoting the\nefficiency of the public services it performs. (Rankin v. McPherson (1987) 483 U.S. 378,\n388.) “Application of this balancing test entails a factual inquiry into such matters as\nwhether the speech (i) impairs discipline or control by superiors, (ii) disrupts co-worker\nrelations, (iii) erodes a close working relationship premised on personal loyalty and\nconfidentiality, (iv) interferes with the speaker’s performance of her or his duties, or\n(v) obstructs the routine operation of the office. The ‘manner, time, and place’ in which\nthe speech occurred also constitute relevant considerations.” (Rendish v. City of Tacoma\n(9th Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 1216, 1224–1225.) “Disruption must be ‘actual, material and\nsubstantial,’ not ‘imagined.’ [Citation.] However, the employer need not ‘allow events\nto unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working\nrelationships is manifest before taking action.’ [Citation.] ‘When close working\nrelationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference\nto the employer’s judgment is appropriate.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1225; Gray v. County\nof Tulare (1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1091–1095.) The “‘state interest element of the\ntest focuses on the effective functioning of the public employer’s enterprise. Interference\nwith work, personnel relationships, or the speaker’s job performance can detract from the\npublic employer’s function; avoiding such interference can be a strong state interest.’\n[Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1092.)\n       Below, the Trustees did not raise either the Pickering or Mt. Healthy defenses. On\nappeal, they cite no evidence establishing that speech such as Katbi’s letter disrupts the\nDistrict’s offices, destroys working relationships, etc. Nor do they cite evidence that they\nwould have taken the same action regardless of whether they harbored a retaliatory\nmotive. We conclude that the Trustees failed to establish that either of these defenses\napply. (Hepner v. Franchise Tax Bd. (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1475, 1486 [points not\nraised in the trial court will not be considered].)\n\n                                              34\n\f              5. Qualified Immunity.\n       The Trustees argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because there was\nno clearly established indication that the discretionary decision to vote to debar the FTR\nParties violated any constitutional rights. This argument misstates the issue. The issue is\nwhether it was clearly established that Katbi’s letter addressed an issue of public concern,\nand that it was unconstitutional to debar the FTR Parties in retaliation for Katbi’s exercise\nof his First Amendment rights in that letter.\n       Here, the Trustees had fair warning at the time they voted to debar the FTR Parties\nthat it could not do so in retaliation for Katbi’s letter. Case law established that\nindependent contractors enjoy First Amendment protection (Bd. of County Comm’rs v.\nUmbehr (1996) 518 U.S. 668, 685 (Umbehr)), and that speech addresses a matter of\npublic concern if it relates to any matter of political, social or other concern to the\ncommunity such as corruption, wrongdoing or misconduct by government agents, or if it\nwas a subject of legitimate news interest. (Sydner, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 452; Alpha,\nsupra, 381 F.3d at p. 926.) It also established that a public official cannot retaliate\nagainst a public contractor for exercising its First Amendment rights. (Id. at p. 923;\nUmbehr, supra, 518 U.S. at p. 685 [a public entity cannot terminate a preexisting\nrelationship with an independent government contractor in retaliation for exercising First\nAmendment rights].)\n              6. Absolute Immunity.\n       Under federal jurisprudence, judges have absolute immunity from suit under\nsection 1983. (Cleavinger v. Saxner (1985) 474 U.S. 193, 199.) This immunity has been\nextended “to certain others who perform functions closely associated with the judicial\nprocess” such as lawyers and witnesses. (Id. at p. 200.) Per the language of Butz v.\nEconomou (1978) 438 U.S. 478, 512 (Butz), absolute immunity is “necessary to assure\nthat judges, advocates, and witnesses can perform their respective functions without\nharassment or intimidation.”\n       Immunity is justified because the “safeguards built into the judicial process tend to\nreduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional\n\n                                                35\n\fconduct. The insulation of the judge from political influence, the importance of\nprecedent in resolving controversies, the adversary nature of the process, and the\ncorrectability of error on appeal are just a few of the many checks on malicious action by\njudges. Advocates are restrained not only by their professional obligations, but by the\nknowledge that their assertions will be contested by their adversaries in open court.\nJurors are carefully screened to remove all possibility of bias. Witnesses are . . . subject\nto the rigors of cross-examination and the penalty of perjury. Because these features of\nthe judicial process tend to enhance the reliability of information and the impartiality of\nthe decisionmaking process, there is a less pressing need for individual suits to correct\nconstitutional error.” (Butz, supra, 438 U.S. at p. 512.)\n       We conclude that the Trustees are not entitled to absolute immunity. Unlike a\njudge, who would be subject to disqualification under Code of Civil Procedure sections\n170.1 and 170.6 if he or she was biased against a party, the Trustees were not subject to\ndisqualification. The result in this case was that the Trustees, having authorized a lawsuit\nagainst FTR, were in the position of presiding over issues that they had arguably\nprejudged. Prehearing discovery was not permitted. A review of the committee’s ruling\nand findings indicates that it lacked legal training and was essentially indifferent to legal\nprecedent. Instead of having a command of the legal issues presented, the committee\nrelied heavily on Orbach and Goulet for guidance and therefore lacked the independence\nof thought that is the hallmark of judicial office. Thus, we conclude that the debarment\nhearing lacked essential safeguards necessary to reduce the need for private damages\nactions as a means for controlling unconstitutional conduct.\n       Additionally, while a judge does no more than enforce the law or preside over\ndisputes between third parties, the Trustees decided whether the District, as a consumer\nof construction services and a participant in the marketplace, would consider bids from\nthe FTR Parties for five years. In that sense, the Trustees did not perform a function that\nis closely associated with the judicial process. A statement by Trustee Park during the\nhearing before the committee highlights the point. She stated, “You know, we’re not\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\flawyers; we’re not judges here. We’re trying to do the best . . . for our constituents in\nprotecting the public works in our contracts.”\n       The Trustees suggest that Butz and Buckles v. King County (9th Cir. 1999)\n191 F.3d 1127 (Buckles) dictate a finding of absolute immunity. We disagree because\nthey are materially distinguishable. At issue in Butz was an administrative hearing\nconducted before a hearing officer who was enforcing the law rather than deciding\nwhether a public entity would enter into future public contracts with a defendant. Unlike\nthe Trustees, who are appointed, the hearing officer in Butz was insulated from political\ninfluence. Last, the parties in Butz had a right that the FTR Parties did not have, i.e., the\nparties in Butz were entitled to know the findings and conclusions on all of the issues of\nfact, law and discretion. (Butz, supra, 438 U.S. at pp. 512–513.) The proceedings in\nBuckles reflected “the same characteristics of the judicial process identified as sufficient\nin Butz.” (Buckles, supra, 191 F.3d at p. 1134.) Also, the procedures in Buckles\nprovided “for disqualification of the Board members for bias and prejudice.” (Id. at\np. 1134.) No such procedure was available here.\nV. The Official Capacity Section 1983 Claims; the Taxpayer Claim.\n       Pursuant to taxpayer claim in the FAC, the FTR Parties sought to enjoin the\nDistrict from unlawfully debarring the FTR Parties and violating its state and federal\nconstitutional rights.20 As well, the FAC alleged: “There is an actual controversy\nbetween plaintiffs and defendants concerning their respective rights and duties in that\nplaintiffs contend that the policies and practices of defendants . . . are in violation of state\nand federal law and contrary to the factual circumstances, as alleged herein, whereas\ndefendants contend in all respects to the contrary.”\n\n\n20\n        Code of Civil Procedure section 526a provides in relevant part: “An action to\nobtain a judgment, restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or\ninjury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a county, town, city or city and county of\nthe State, may be maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person,\nacting in its behalf, either by a citizen resident therein, or by a corporation, who is\nassessed for and is liable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of the\naction, has paid, a tax therein.”\n\n                                               37\n\f       In the procedural due process claim in the FAC, the FTR Parties were seeking\nrelief that would enjoin the Trustees from “engaging in each of the unlawful practices,\npolicies, customs and usages” alleged, and from “using any of the charges or accusations\nasserted in the debarment proceeding to take any negative actions against [the FTR\nParties], including but not limited to initiating further debarment proceedings . . . ,\nseeking to label [the FTR Parties] . . . as ‘non-responsible’ bidders with respect to any\n[District] projects, invoking the ‘convenience’ clause to terminate any outstanding\ncontract, or making any public or official statements [about the FTR Parties] or any of\ntheir agents or principals[.]”\n       The TAC requested the same relief. Thus, the relief was requested in part due to\nthe First Amendment retaliation claim.\n       Fairly understood, the taxpayer and official capacity claims arise out of the\ndebarment hearing, the debarment and the termination of FTR’s contracts. These were\nacts of governance by the District. Applying the anti-SLAPP statute to these types of acts\nwould chill challenges to governmental action. Based on San Ramon, we hold that the\nanti-SLAPP statute does not apply.\nVI. The Interference Claims; the Negligence Claim.\n       The Trustees contend that the second anti-SLAPP motion should have been\ngranted as to the state tort claims because they are immune from liability under\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9.\n       We agree.\n       A. Immunity for Act of Discretion.\n       “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an\ninjury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the\nexercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.” (Gov.\nCode, § 820.2.)\n       The FTR Parties argue that the Trustees’ decision to debar nonresponsible bidders\nis not discretionary. We cannot concur. Pursuant to Public Contract Code section 20651,\nsubdivision (b), the governing board of a community college district must award a\n\n                                              38\n\fcontract for a public project to the lowest responsible bidder. The District has discretion\nto determine which bidders are responsible. (Stacy & Witbeck, Inc. v. City and County of\nSan Francisco (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1074, 1094, fn. 9 [“municipalities have discretion\nto determine which bidders are ‘responsible’”].) Debarment is “a necessary means to\nenable the contracting governmental agency to deal with irresponsible bidders and\ncontractors, and to administer its duties with efficiency. [Citation.]” (Golden Day,\nsupra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 704.) Viewed properly, debarment is not an obligation; it is a\ndiscretionary tool at the District’s disposal.\n       Regardless of whether the debarment was discretionary, the FTR Parties contend\nthat it does not fall within Government Code section 820.2 because it was an operational\ndecision rather than a policy decision.\n       Under California common law, a governmental official had “personal immunity\nfrom lawsuits challenging his or her discretionary acts within the scope of authority.\n[Citation.]” (Caldwell v. Montoya (1995) 10 Cal.4th 972, 979 (Caldwell) [holding that\nthe votes by school board members not to renew the contract of a superintendant\nqualified as discretionary acts within the meaning of Gov. Code, § 820.2].) This\nimmunity protected an official even if he or she acted with malice. (Caldwell, supra,\n10 Cal.4th at p. 979.) When the Legislature enacted the Tort Claims Act, it codified the\ntraditional immunity for discretionary acts in Government Code section 820.2.\n(Caldwell, supra, at p. 980.) Our Supreme Court explained that the “immunity is\nreserved for those basic policy decisions which have . . . been [expressly] committed to\ncoordinate branches of government[.]” (Caldwell, supra, at p. 981.) In contrast, “there is\nno basis for immunizing lower-level, or ‘ministerial,’ decisions that merely implement a\nbasic policy already formulated. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Consequently, “immunity applies\nonly to deliberate and considered policy decisions, in which a ‘[conscious] balancing [of]\nrisks and advantages . . . took place. The fact that an employee normally engages in\n“discretionary activity” is irrelevant if, in a given case, the employee did not render a\nconsidered decision. [Citations].’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Boiled down, case law\ndistinguishes between “policy and operational judgments.” (Ibid.)\n\n                                                 39\n\f          Five years after Caldwell, our Supreme Court decided Barner v. Leeds (2000)\n24 Cal.4th 676, 684. In that case, the court held that Government Code section 820.2\ncould not be asserted as a defense to a claim that a deputy public defender committed\nlegal malpractice. (Id. at pp. 679–680.) The opinion rested on the premise that “the acts\nor omissions of a deputy public defender in representing a defendant in a criminal action\ndo not involve the type of basic policy decisions that are insulated from liability[.]”\n(Ibid.)\n          Our attention now switches to the world of public contracts.\n          Citing a string of cases and Government Code section 820.2, Pacific Architects\nCollaborative v. State of California (1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 110, 121 (Pacific Architects),\nstated, “Insofar as the decision not to award [a] contract was based on the exercise of\ndiscretion by the state employees, governmental immunity precludes the imposition of\nany liability based on a tort theory. [Citations.]” The court added that the “determination\nof the identity of the lowest responsible bidder [citation] and the decision of whether to\naward the contract to any of the bidders or reject all bids [citation] involves the exercise\nof discretion[,]” and Government Code section 820.2 applies. (Pacific Architects, supra,\n100 Cal.App.3d at p. 189.) In Curcini v. County of Alameda (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 629\n(Curcini), the court held that the decision to reject all bids for a chaplain services contract\nat a jail was protected by Government Code section 820.2. Curcini relied, in part, on\nMonterey Mechanical Co. v. Sacramento Regional County Sanitation Dist. (1996) 44\nCal.App.4th 1391, 1413, which stated, “Because the award of a public contract involves\nthe exercise of discretion, the government employees and entities involved are immune\nfrom liability.”\n          Under scrutiny now is debarments.\n          As explained in Taylor Bus Service, Inc. v. San Diego Bd. of Education (1987)\n195 Cal.App.3d 1331, 1341–1342, “A determination that a bidder is responsible is a\ncomplex matter dependent, often, on information received outside the bidding process\nand requiring, in many cases, an application of subtle judgment. Not only is the process\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fcomplex, but the declaration of nonresponsibility may have an adverse impact on the\nprofessional or business reputation of the bidder.”\n       In the words of Golden Day, “Debarment is never a matter of small moment.”\n(Golden Day, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 703.) Quoting a federal case dating back to\n1970, Golden Day adopted the recognition that the consequences of debarment “‘will\nvary, depending upon multiple factors: the size and prominence of the contractor, the\nratio of his government business to non-government business; the length of his\ncontractual relationship with government; his dependence on that business; his ability to\nsecure other business as a substitute for government business. . . . The impact of\ndebarment on a contractor may be a sudden contraction of bank credit, adverse impact on\nmarket price of shares of listed stock, if any, and critical uneasiness of creditors\ngenerally, to say nothing of “loss of face” in the business community. These\nconsequences are in addition to the loss of specific profits from the business denied as a\nresult of debarment.’” (Id. at pp. 703–704.)\n       Based on the foregoing authorities, we conclude that the Trustees’ decision to\ndebar the FTR Parties involved a discretionary policy decision as to whether to trust the\nFTR Parties with public projects and millions of dollars for five years. The decision\nrequired the Trustees to form a considered opinion about the impact of debarring or not\ndebarring the FTR Parties on the District and its existing contracts. Other than requiring\na fair hearing before a debarment, it would be unseemly for courts to interfere in the\nDistrict’s debarment decisions (Caldwell, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 981) because a\ndebarment occurs at the planning stage, i.e., it constitutes a plan regarding who will or\nwill not be eligible to build public projects. If the decision not to award a public contract\nis protected by immunity, as established in Pacific Architects and Curcini, then certainly\nthe decision to debar a contractor and not award any contracts to that contractor for a set\nperiod of time is protected by immunity.21\n\n21\n      Moreover, we find no meaningful distinction between this case and Ogborn v. City\nof Lancaster (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 448. There, the court held that a public official\ncharged with administering a city’s nuisance abatement program was entitled to\n\n                                              41\n\f       B. Immunity for Act of a Public Entity.\n       Government Code section 820.9 provides in relevant part that “members of\ngoverning boards of . . . local public entities . . . are not vicariously liable for injuries\ncaused by the act or omission of the public entity or advisory body. Nothing in this\nsection exonerates an official from liability for injury caused by that individual’s own\nwrongful conduct.” (Gov. Code, § 820.9.) A local public entity “includes a county, city,\ndistrict, public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public\ncorporation in the State, but does not include the State.” (Gov. Code, § 900.4.) Under\nthese statutes the District is a local public entity, and the Trustees are therefore members\nof a governing board of a local public entity.\n       We conclude that the Trustees are entitled to immunity. The disruption of FTR’s\ncontracts and relationships was caused by the debarment, which was an action taken by\nthe District. Through its interference claims, the FTR Parties seek to hold the Trustees\nvicariously liable for the District’s action.\n       The FTR Parties urge us to conclude that the Trustees are being sued not for the\ndebarment by the District but for their own wrongful conduct in casting votes designed to\ndebar them without procedural due process and in retaliation for Katbi’s exercise of First\nAmendment rights. We decline. “Courts are reluctant to attribute to the Legislature an\nintent to create ‘an illogical or confusing scheme’ [citation]; legislative policy is best\neffectuated by avoiding those constructions which lead to mischief or absurdity.”\n(People v. Jeffers (1987) 43 Cal.3d 984, 998–999.) If we were to construe the statute as\nthe FTR Parties suggest, then the exception would swallow the rule. Even if the\nmembers of governing boards could not be sued for the acts of local public entities, they\ncould be sued for causing those acts, and their exposure to liability would be no different\nthan if the immunity provided in Government Code section 820.9 did not exist.\n\n\n\n\nimmunity after “making the discretionary policy decision to declare [a property] a\nnuisance.” (Id. at p. 461.) Debarring a contractor is no less a policy decision than\ndeclaring that a nuisance exists.\n\n                                                42\n\fVII. Attorney Fees.\n       Subdivision (c)(1) of the anti-SLAPP statute provides that if the trial court “finds\nthat a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary\ndelay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing\non the motion, pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 128.5.” Based on this\nstatutory provision, the trial court awarded attorney fees. This was error.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (b)(2) defines frivolous to\nmean “totally and completely” without merit, or for the “sole” purpose of harassing the\nopposing party. “When a motion has partial merit, it is not ‘totally and completely’\nwithout merit, nor can it be said that its ‘sole’ purpose is to harass.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims,\nWeil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 435, 450.)22\n       This opinion establishes that the first anti-SLAPP motion should have been\ngranted as to the personal capacity due process claim. Thus, the motion had at least\npartial merit, and it was not frivolous.\nVIII. The Trial Judge.\n       The Board and Trustees request that we “consider whether in the interests of\njustice [we] should direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge other\nthan” the trial judge who ruled on their motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 170.1, subd. (c).)\nThey contend that disqualification is mandated because the trial judge demonstrated\nanimus inconsistent with judicial objectivity and, therefore, a reasonable man would\nentertain doubts concerning the trial judge’s impartiality. (People v. Enriquez (2008) 160\n\n\n22\n        The FTR Parties suggest, and the trial court found, that the frivolous nature of the\nfirst anti-SLAPP motion is established, in part, because the District and Trustees violated\na stipulation. After the FAC was filed, the parties stipulated to an extension of the\ndeadline for the District and Trustees to file any pleading responsive to the FAC. In\naddition, the FTR Parties were given until the deadline to file a second amended\ncomplaint. On the same day the stipulation was signed, and without notice to the FTR\nParties, the District and Trustees filed the first anti-SLAPP motion seeking an order\nstriking the FAC. The trial court found that this action raised the inference that the sole\npurpose of the motion was to harass. Given that the motion had partial merit, any such\ninference is negated.\n\n                                             43\n\fCal.App.4th 230, 244.) After reviewing the record, we conclude that this is not one of\nthose rare cases where the trial judge should be disqualified.\n       All other issues raised by the parties are moot.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The orders denying the anti-SLAPP motions are reversed in part and affirmed in\npart. On remand, the trial court is instructed to grant the motions as to the personal\ncapacity claim under section 1983 for the denial of procedural due process, the claim for\nintentional interference with contract and/or prospective economic advantage, and the\nclaim for negligence. Under section 1983, the official capacity claims for denial of\nprocedural due process and First Amendment retaliation as well as the personal capacity\nclaim for First Amendment retaliation may proceed. So, too, can the taxpayer claim\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 526a. The award of attorney fees in connection\nwith the first anti-SLAPP motion is reversed.\n       The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n       NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS.\n\n\n\n\n                                          __________________________, Acting P.

(FTR) and Nizar Katbi (Katbi) (collectively\nFTR Parties) from bidding or working on District projects for five years. Alleging\nvarious wrongs, the FTR Parties sued the Board and six of its individual trustees\n(Trustees).1 The Board and Trustees appeal from: (1) the denial of their anti-SLAPP2\nmotion to strike the FTR Parties’ first amended complaint (FAC); (2) the denial of the\nTrustees’ anti-SLAPP motion to strike the new claims in the third amended complaint\n(TAC); and (3) the award of attorney fees to the FTR Parties after the trial court found\nthat the first anti-SLAPP motion was frivolous.\n       Based on qualified immunity, we conclude that the first anti-SLAPP motion\nshould have been granted as to the FTR Parties’ personal capacity claim against the\nTrustees for denial of procedural due process at the debarment hearing in violation of title\n42 United States Code section 1983 (section 1983). Because of the immunities in\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9, the second anti-SLAPP motion should have\nbeen granted as to the FTR Parties’ claim for intentional interference with contract and/or\nprospective economic advantage, and their claim for negligence. The award of attorney\nfees must be reversed because the first anti-SLAPP motion had partial merit and was not\nfrivolous as a matter of law. In all other respects, the orders are affirmed.\n       Upon remand, what remains for further proceedings are: a taxpayer claim against\nthe Board and Trustees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526a; official\ncapacity claims against the Trustees under section 1983 for denial of procedural due\nprocess and First Amendment retaliation; and a personal capacity claim against the\nTrustees under section 1983 for First Amendment retaliation.\n\n\n1\n      The Trustees are Miguel Santiago, Tina Park (Trustee Park), Nancy Pearlman,\nKelly Candaele, Scott J.

The anti-SLAPP statute is\nCode of Civil Procedure section 425.16.\n\n\n                                              2\n\f                                          FACTS3\n       The Project at Los Angeles Valley College\n       In 2006, the District contracted with FTR to build the Allied Health and Science\nBuilding at Los Angeles Valley College (Allied Project). Robert Payinda (Payinda) was\nthe District’s project inspector. The Allied Project was substantially complete in 2008.\n       Katbi negotiated with the District’s project manager to finalize the job and settle\nall outstanding issues in exchange for a $40,000 credit from FTR. The District’s project\nmanager told FTR it had no more responsibility on the project. As a result, FTR and the\nDistrict entered into a final change order that stated: “This is a final change order for full\nand final settlement for all disputes, extras, credits, back charges, time delays, delay for\ndamages and/or impact between both parties.” Katbi understood that after signing the\nfinal change order, FTR and the District would not have claims against each other.\nSubsequently, he submitted a Division of the State Architect Verified Report (DSA 6\nForm) and represented that the Allied Project was 100 percent complete.4 On August 3,\n2009, the Board ratified the final change order between the parties.\n       On March 24, 2010, FTR filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the District\nto release funds withheld pursuant to stop notices.\n\n3\n       Below, the District and Trustees objected to evidence submitted by the FTR\nParties. The Board and Trustees contend that the trial court erred by overruling a\nmajority of those objections. The objections in connection with the first anti-SLAPP\nmotion have been waived on appeal because the Board and Trustees failed to analyze\ntheir objections by applying the relevant law to the specific objectionable evidence.\n(Alvarez v.

Certain objections\npertaining to the second anti-SLAPP motion have been adequately briefed, and we have\nconsidered them. Our statements of facts was written with these considerations in mind.\n4\n         At the debarment hearing, the architect for the Allied Project, Andrew Labov, was\nasked to explain the difference between substantial completion and 100 percent\ncompletion. He testified: “The difference is . . . that substantial completion you identify\nthat . . . work is still remaining to be done on the project, and final completion is when all\nparties agree that all of that work has been completed or the owner waives his right and\naccepts work in the as-is condition.”\n\n\n                                              3\n\f       As authorized by the Board, the District filed a cross-complaint and alleged that\nFTR was negligent and breached its contract by performing defective work when\nconstructing the Allied Project. In a statement of claims, the District listed $4,366,111.64\nin damages.5\n       The Project at Los Angeles Mission College\n       In 2007, the District hired FTR as the general contractor to build the Health and\nPhysical Education Fitness Center at Los Angeles Mission College (Mission Project). By\nmid-2008, the District issued change order No. 1, which related to a pipeline and\nearthwork. In addition, the college project manager, Nick Quintanilla (Quintanilla),6\nasked FTR to comply with field order Nos. 36 and 37, which was grading and trenching\nwork outside the scope of the original project. At first, FTR balked at the field orders\nbecause it had not been paid about $1 million for already completed extra work.\nHowever, Katbi told his employees to move forward, and they did.\n       FTR drafted pay request No. 14, which it submitted to the District. In that pay\nrequest, for each item, FTR estimated how much work was completed and how much it\nexpected to complete by the end of July 2008. Regarding change order No. 1, FTR\nestimated that 43 percent was complete.\n       Quintanilla spoke to his superiors and was advised that the District’s executive\ndirector, Larry Eisenberg (Eisenberg), and others wanted to avoid any delays and had\ntherefore approved paying FTR for extra work with money earmarked for other items.\nSubsequently, Quintanilla told FTR to bill 90 percent of the work on change order No. 1.\n\n\n\n5\n        The record suggests that this action was deemed related to a lawsuit filed by\nHickman Mechanical, Inc. against FTR (Hickman Mechanical, Inc. v. FTR International,\nInc. et al. (Super. Ct. L.A. County, No. BC398074) (Hickman Action).\n6\n       Through a construction company called Gateway, Quintanilla was the person hired\nby the District to supervise the Mission Project. Communication between FTR and the\nDistrict went through Quintanilla. FTR submitted pay applications once a month after\nnegotiating the percentages with Quintanilla.\n\n\n                                             4\n\fFTR revised pay request No. 14 as Quintanilla instructed, and it was then paid by the\nDistrict.7\n       The Los Angeles Times Articles\n       In February 2011, the Los Angeles Times published a series of articles accusing\ncollege officials, contractors and the Board of wasting tens of millions of dollars due to\npoor planning, frivolous spending and shoddy workmanship. A March 2011 article\nfocused on the Allied Project. It claimed that the project had numerous and serious\ndefects and was critical of FTR, Eisenberg and many others. According to the article,\nPayinda issued 422 citations for deviations in design. Later in the same month, the\nLos Angeles Times published an article stating that the District had fired Eisenberg, and\nthat he would be replaced by Thomas Hall (Hall) as the interim executive director.\n       Katbi’s Letter to the Trustees\n       In a letter dated October 5, 2011, Katbi wrote to the Trustees to defend FTR\nagainst rumors, gossip and false statements made by the Los Angeles Times and former\nDistrict employees. According to the letter: None of the accusations against FTR were\ntrue. The problems at the Allied Project were caused by subcontractors, and FTR had\ninsurance in place to cover the defective work. The real problem at the Allied Project\nwas Payinda. He was a racist who repeatedly disparaged Arabs, who he referred to as\n“turban heads.” In addition, he said companies such as FTR should not be allowed to\ntake jobs away from American companies. At one point, FTR complained to the District\nthat Payinda was using foul language to FTR’s employees and displaying lewd pictures\nof naked women on the walls of the trailer/office that he used on the college campus.\nAfter FTR complained, Payinda smeared FTR by blaming it for all the design errors and\ncreating a long list of nonconforming work. Moreover, Payinda submitted fraudulent\nbills to the District for his time and that of an assistant inspector. Based on Payinda as a\n\n\n\n7\n       The FTR parties represent that the District “later modified the paperwork to reflect\nthe proper payments and work done under the proper work orders.”\n\n\n                                              5\n\fsource, the Los Angeles Times published several articles containing false statements that\npainted FTR in a negative light.\n       Continuing on, the letter stated that when FTR submitted the low bid on a project\nat East Los Angeles College, the second and third low bidders sent protest letters. One of\nthe protests falsely stated that FTR had been terminated on a project at Pierce College.\nThe District informed FTR it planned to honor the protests and reject FTR’s bid. This\nwas done in bad faith because the District made the decision before reviewing FTR’s\nresponses to the protests.\n       Notice of Debarment Hearing\n       The District’s staff recommended that the FTR Parties be debarred for five years.\nIn a letter dated October 17, 2011, Hall notified the FTR Parties that a committee of the\nTrustees would hold a hearing in December 2011 to determine whether the FTR Parties\nshould be debarred for up to five years from bidding, contracting, subcontracting or\nperforming work on any District project, and whether the FTR Parties should be found\nnonresponsible bidders with respect to the Math & Science Complex at East Los Angeles\nCollege.\n       The letter listed the following three charges:\n       (I) When FTR submitted pay request No. 14 in connection with the Mission\nProject, the pay request falsely stated that change order No. 1 was 90 percent complete.\n(II) FTR submitted a false DSA-6 Form for the Allied Project stating that the “entire\n[Division of the State Architect (DSA)] approved scope is 100 [percent] complete,” that\nall noncompliant work was completed, and that “all construction has, in every material\nrespect, been performed in compliance with the DSA approved documents.” (III) FTR\nfailed to construct the exterior envelope of the Allied Project, FTR substituted improper\nand inadequate materials, and it failed to meet the standard of care in the construction\nindustry.\n       The FTR Parties’ Ex Parte Application\n       FTR filed an ex parte application seeking a temporary restraining order and an\norder to show cause regarding a preliminary injunction preventing the District from\n\n                                             6\n\fholding a debarment hearing. Also, FTR requested leave to file a second amended\ncomplaint to add a cause of action for an injunction enjoining the District from\nproceeding with the debarment hearing during the pendency of litigation, and a cause of\naction seeking a declaration from the trial court that the debarment hearing was\nunconstitutional and illegal.\n       In support of the application, Katbi submitted a declaration stating that FTR would\ngo out of business if it was debarred.\n       The ex parte application was denied.\n       The FTR Parties’ Prehearing Requests; the District’s Response\n       Via an e-mail to the Board’s counsel, David Orbach (Orbach), the FTR Parties\nrequested an opportunity to voir dire the Trustees. Then, in a letter to Orbach, the FTR\nParties objected to the Board being the arbiter of the debarment hearing on the grounds of\nbias. According to the FTR Parties, the Board was biased, inter alia, because of the\nongoing litigation between FTR and the District, and because the FTR Parties had been\nsingled out for selective prosecution due to Katbi being an Arab-American of Syrian\ndescent. The FTR Parties requested a hearing before a neutral hearing officer pursuant to\nBoard Rule 71400.40.\n       Orbach responded by letter and informed the FTR Parties that the District intended\nto proceed with the hearing as noticed. He indicated that the FTR Parties would not be\nallowed to voir dire the Trustees.\n       The Debarment Hearing Before the Committee\n       The debarment hearing was held before a Board committee comprised of Trustee\nPark and Mona Field (Trustee Field).8 Trustee Park indicated at the outset that the staff\nrecommendation of debarment would be presented by attorneys Keith Smith and Stewart\nReid from the law firm of Wood, Smith, Henning and Berman, and that the committee\nand Board would be independently advised by Orbach. Camille A. Goulet (Goulet), from\nthe District’s Office of the General Counsel, was also present. As the hearing proceeded,\n\n8\n       Trustee Field is not a party to the litigation.\n\n\n                                               7\n\fvarious witnesses testified. Orbach advised the committee on such issues as how to\nproceed and how to rule on evidentiary objections. At one point, the FTR Parties’\nattorney objected to a question, and Orbach stated, “The witness may go ahead and\nanswer.”\n       When the parties finished presenting their evidence and arguments, counsel for the\nFTR Parties requested findings on their affirmative defenses of estoppel, unclean hands,\nlaches and selective prosecution. Orbach informed the committee that “it would be my\nrecommendation that you do not respond to counsel’s request[.]” He went on to provide\nthe committee with written findings. They read the findings into the record, made some\nmodifications, and then voted to adopt the findings and recommend a three-year\ndebarment. As recommended by Orbach, the committee did not rule on the affirmative\ndefenses.\n       Following the hearing, Orbach prepared a document entitled Committee’s Report,\nFindings and Recommendation.\n       The District’s Debarment of the FTR Parties\n       In February 2013, the full Board convened and considered the recommendation of\nthe committee. Orbach fielded questions from the Trustees regarding the length of the\ndebarment and other matters. The Board voted to debar the FTR Parties for five years.9\nLater, the Board terminated five existing projects with FTR. As a result, the District\nrefused to pay over $10 million that it owed to FTR for work it had completed on those\nprojects.\n       FTR’s Losses on Projects for Other Entities; FTR Goes out of Business\n       At the time of the debarment, FTR had existing projects with the City of Long\nBeach Board of Harbor Commissioners, the City of Los Angeles Board of Harbor\nCommissioners, the Signal Hill Redevelopment Agency, the Southern California\nRegional Rail Authority, the City of Irvine, and the City of La Quinta. Due to the\ndebarment, FTR’s creditors placed stop notices on FTR projects and refused to provide\n\n9\n       While Trustee Field voted yes to debar the FTR Parties for three years, she voted\nno to debarring them for five years.\n\n                                             8\n\fFTR with credit. It was unable to obtain surety bonds, and therefore it was unable to bid\non additional projects. FTR lost millions of dollars in contract balances, change orders,\nretention and lost profits.\n          Shortly after the debarment, FTR went out of business. It laid off nearly 300\nemployees, and its creditors filed claims to recover more than $25 million. Because\nKatbi personally guaranteed all of FTR’s loans, Katbi suffered financial loss, and damage\nto his reputation and creditworthiness.\n          The FTR Parties’ New Action\n          The FTR Parties filed a combined petition for writ of administrative mandate\nchallenging the debarment order and a complaint for damages. In the complaint, they\nalleged a federal civil rights claim under section 1983 for violation of due process, and a\ntaxpayer claim under Code of Civil Procedure section 526a. The section 1983 claim\nsought damages. Both claims sought injunctive and declaratory relief. The Board as well\nas the Trustees were named as defendants. The case was deemed related to the parties’\nongoing litigation in the Hickman Action.\n          Subsequently, the FTR Parties filed the FAC.\n          The Trial Court’s Decision to Grant FTR’s Petition for Writ of Mandate\n          The trial court held a hearing on the writ petition and made, inter alia, the\nfollowing findings: (1) all charges sustained against the FTR Parties by the Board should\nbe found in favor of the FTR Parties; (2) the Board failed to properly consider FTR’s\nequitable defenses; (3) the debarment hearing should have been held before a neutral\narbitrator; and (4) there was an unacceptable probability that the Board was biased\nbecause any finding in favor of the FTR Parties would have undermined the Board’s\nlawsuit against them. The trial court issued a writ directing the Board to set aside the\ndebarment order. It then ruled that charge III could be relitigated, but charges I and II\nwere barred by equitable estoppel and waiver, and that charge I was also barred by\nlaches.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f       The First Anti-SLAPP Motion\n       The Board and Trustees filed an anti-SLAPP motion to the section 1983 and\ntaxpayer claims and argued, among other things, that they were entitled to qualified\nimmunity on the federal claim. The motion was denied, and the Board and Trustees\nappealed.\n       The FTR Parties filed a motion for attorney fees on the grounds that the anti-\nSLAPP motion was frivolous. The trial court granted the motion and awarded the FTR\nParties $72,897.80. Once again, the Board and Trustees appealed.\n       The TAC; the Second Anti-SLAPP Motion; the Demurrer\n       Pursuant to a stipulation, the eventual second amended complaint was superseded\nby the TAC. It alleged a second section 1983 claim. It was based on alleged retaliation,\ninter alia, for Katbi’s exercise of his First Amendment right to send the October 5, 2011,\nletter to the Trustees. Also, the TAC alleged a claim for intentional interference with\ncontract and/or prospective economic advantage, and also a claim for negligence.\n       The Trustees filed an anti-SLAPP motion to the retaliation, interference and\nnegligence claims. As to the federal claim, they argued that they could not be sued under\nsection 1983 for their official actions and, in any event, they enjoyed absolute quasi-\njudicial immunity and qualified immunity. As for the state tort claims, the Trustees\nargued, among other things, that they were entitled to the immunities provided by\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9, and that the negligence claim was\nadditionally deficient because it did not allege the existence of liability under the Tort\nClaims Act.\n       Raising some of the same arguments, the Trustees demurred to multiple claims set\nforth in the TAC.\n       Both matters were heard on September 12, 2013.\n       With respect to the demurrer, the trial court rejected the Government Code\nimmunity defenses on the grounds that they applied only to discretionary policy\ndecisions, and that the debarment at issue was nothing more than an operational decision.\nThe demurrer was sustained with leave to amend with respect to the negligence claim so\n\n                                             10\n\fthat the FTR Parties could allege a statutory basis for liability under the Tort Claims Act.\nIn all other respects, the demurrer was overruled. The anti-SLAPP motion was denied.\n       The District and Trustees appealed.10\n                                      DISCUSSION11\nI.

In Connection With the Section 1983 Claims, the Trustees Were Sued in Their\nOfficial and Individual Capacities.\n       As a preliminary matter, we must determine the capacity in which the Trustees\nwere sued under section 1983.\n       Section 1983 provides: “Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State . . . , subjects . . . any citizen of the United\nStates or other person . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at\nlaw, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress, except that in any action\nbrought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer’s judicial\ncapacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated or\ndeclaratory relief was unavailable.”\n       A public official can be sued in an official capacity, a personal capacity or both. A\npersonal-capacity suit “seek[s] to impose personal liability upon a government official for\nactions he takes under color of state law.” (Kentucky v. Graham (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n165 (Kentucky); Pitts v.

An official-capacity suit is another way of “‘pleading an action\nagainst an entity of which an officer is an agent.’ [Citation.]” (Kentucky, supra, 473 U.S.\nat pp. 165–166.) To “establish personal liability in a [section 1983] action, it is enough to\nshow that the official, acting under color of state law, caused the deprivation of a federal\nright.

This requires us to\npinpoint the claim’s principal thrust. (Martinez v. Metabolife Internat., Inc.

All of these\nallegations were incorporated by reference into the claim for violation of procedural due\nprocess.\n       As to damages, the procedural due process claim alleged: “As a direct and\nproximate result of defendants’ unlawful actions as alleged herein, plaintiffs have\nincurred and will incur economic damage and losses, lost business opportunity, damage\nto professional and personal reputation, and plaintiff Katbi has suffered severe emotional\ndistress and other injuries, thus entitling plaintiffs to general and compensatory damages\nin amounts to be proven at trial.” The claim also alleged that the FTR Parties were\n\n                                              16\n\fentitled to punitive damages because the Trustees acted in conscious disregard of the\nFTR Parties’ rights.\n       The FTR Parties contend that the principal thrust of this claim is that the Trustees\ndenied them procedural due process in connection with the hearing, processing and\ndeciding of the three charges. We disagree. The Trustees’ votes are what led to FTR\nbeing debarred for five years and suffering damages. (Vergos v.

(Farrar\nv.

Because this personal capacity claim seeks compensatory rather than\nnominal damages against the Trustees, it is apparent that the FTR Parties’ main focus is\ncompensation for actual injury caused by the votes rather than, for the sake of principle,\nan attack on how the debarment hearing was conducted.15 To bolster our point, we note\n\n\n15\n        A debarment proceeding implicates a liberty interest. (Southern Cal.\nUnderground Contractors, Inc. v.

(Id. at p. 1092.) The FTR Parties’ reliance is misplaced.

Public Policy Does not Bar the Application of the Anti-SLAPP Statute to\nthe Personal Capacity Claims.\n       Even if the votes would otherwise fit within the scope of the language in Code of\nCivil Procedure section 425.16, subdivision (e), the FTR Parties argue that public policy\ndictates that the anti-SLAPP statute have no application. In their view, applying the anti-\nSLAPP statute here would encourage public officials to insulate their wrongful actions by\nhaving a local political body vote to approve of their misconduct. This argument fails\nbecause the damage would flow from the misconduct, not the vote, and the anti-SLAPP\nstatute would not be triggered by the artifice of that vote.\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\f       Alternatively, the FTR Parties argue that protecting the votes of public officials\nwould chill the right of citizens to challenge unlawful government conduct, and for that\nreason the anti-SLAPP statute should not apply.

It held that the\nretirement board’s action did not constitute protected activity, reasoning: “To decide\notherwise would significantly burden the petition rights of those seeking mandamus\nreview for most types of governmental action. Many of the public entity decisions\nreviewable by mandamus or administrative mandamus are arrived at after discussion and\na vote at a public meeting. [Citations.] If mandamus petitions challenging decisions\nreached in this manner were routinely subject to a special motion to strike . . . [,] the\npetitioners in every such case could be forced to make a prima facie showing of merit at\nthe pleading stage. While that result might not go so far as to impliedly repeal the\nmandamus statutes . . . , it would chill the resort to legitimate judicial oversight over\npotential abuses of legislative and administrative power, which is at the heart of those\n\n                                              19\n\fremedial statutes. It would also ironically impose an undue burden upon the very right of\npetition for those seeking mandamus review in a manner squarely contrary to the\nunderlying legislative intent behind [Code of Civil Procedure] section 425.16.”\n(San Ramon, supra, 125 Cal.App.4th at p. 357.)\n       Giving anti-SLAPP protection to the votes of public officials as opposed to the\naction of a public entity will not chill the ability of citizens to challenge governmental\naction. Under USA Waste, Graffiti Protective Coatings and San Ramon, public entities\ncan still be sued without the burden of the anti-SLAPP statute. Thus, we decline to strip\npublic officials of anti-SLAPP protection.\n              3. The Illegality Exception Does not Apply.\n       The FTR Parties urge us to conclude that the anti-SLAPP statute does not protect\nunconstitutional votes. They rely on Flatley v. Mauro (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600567/flatley-v-mauro/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 320\n(Flatley), which stated that “where a defendant brings a motion to strike under [Code of\nCivil Procedure] section 425.16 based on a claim that the plaintiff’s action arises from\nactivity by the defendant in furtherance of the defendant’s exercise of protected speech or\npetition rights, but either the defendant concedes, or the evidence conclusively\nestablishes, that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter\nof law, the defendant is precluded from using the anti-SLAPP statute to strike the\nplaintiff’s action.” As a counterpunch, the Trustees claim that the Flatley rule applies\nonly to criminal conduct.\n       We agree with the Trustees.\n       Our Supreme Court has not elucidated whether the illegality exception is limited\nto criminal conduct, or whether it can be extended to noncriminal conduct that is\nunlawful in the sense that it violates a principle of constitutional, statutory or common\nlaw. However, as observed in Fremont Reorganizing Corp. v. Faigin (2011)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1169 (Fremont Reorganizing), multiple “Court of Appeal\nopinions have rejected attempts to apply the rule from Flatley . . . to noncriminal\nconduct.” The court concluded that the rule from Flatley “is limited to criminal\nconduct.” (Fremont Reorganizing, supra, 198 Cal.App.4th at p. 1169.) One of the\n\n                                              20\n\fdecisions cited was Mendoza v. ADP Screening & Selection Services, Inc.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mendoza). It concluded that “the Supreme Court’s use of the\nphrase ‘illegal’ [in Flatley] was intended to mean criminal, and not merely violative of a\nstatute.” (Mendoza, supra, 182 Cal.App.4th at p. 1654.) The Mendoza court added that\n“a reading of Flatley to push any statutory violation outside the reach of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute would greatly weaken the constitutional interests which the statute is designed to\nprotect. As [the defendant] correctly observes, a plaintiff’s complaint always alleges a\ndefendant engaged in illegal conduct in that it violated some common law standard of\nconduct or statutory prohibition, giving rise to liability, and we decline to give plaintiffs a\ntool for avoiding the application of the anti-SLAPP statute merely by showing any\nstatutory violation.” (Mendoza, supra, at p. 1654.)\n       We conclude that the reasoning in Fremont Reorganizing and Mendoza is sound,\nand that those cases should be followed.\n              4. The Anti-SLAPP Statute is not Preempted by the Supremacy Clause.\n       The FTR Parties contend that that application of the anti-SLAPP statute to the\nfederal civil rights claims is barred by conflict and obstacle preemption. This contention\ndoes not withstand scrutiny.\n       “The supremacy clause of the United States Constitution establishes a\nconstitutional choice-of-law rule, makes federal law paramount, and vests Congress with\nthe power to preempt state law. [Citations.]” (Viva! Internat. Voice for Animals v.\nAddidas Promotional Retail Operations, Inc.

[Citations.]” (Viva!, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 936.)\nObstacle preemption arises in a particular case when a state law frustrates the objectives\nof Congress. (Ibid.)\n       There is no conflict preemption here. The anti-SLAPP statute prescribes no\nprocedures for debarment hearings, and therefore it does not make it impossible for the\nTrustees to comply with either the requirements of procedural due process when\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\fconducting debarment hearings or the requirements of section 1983. The FTR Parties\noffer no argument to the contrary.\n       This brings us to obstacle preemption.\n       Congress enacted section 1983 “in response to the patent inadequacy of state\nenforcement of constitutional guarantees for the newly enfranchised black citizenry.”\n(Williams v.

Its purpose is “to serve as\nan antidote to discriminatory state laws, to protect federal rights where state law is\ninadequate, and to protect federal rights where state processes are available in theory but\nnot in practice[.]” (Ibid.) This purpose “may not be frustrated by state substantive\nlimitations couched in procedural language.” (Ibid.; County of Los Angeles v.

For example, the Williams court held that the claim filing requirement in the\nGovernment Tort Claims Act “is inoperative in an action brought under section 1983”\nbecause that provision “‘is more than a procedural requirement, it is a condition\nprecedent to [the plaintiff] maintaining an action against [the] defendants[,]’” and is “‘an\nintegral part of [the] plaintiff’s cause of action.’” (Williams, supra, 16 Cal.3d at p. 842.)\n       California appellate courts have held that the anti-SLAPP statute is applicable to\nclaims brought in state court pursuant to section 1983.

(Yonkers, supra, 856 F.2d at pp. 447–452.) On appeal, the city council\nmembers asserted a First Amendment defense. The Yonkers court rejected the defense,\nstating: “Even if we acknowledge that the act of voting has sufficient expressive content\nto be accorded some First Amendment protection as symbolic speech, the public interest\nin obtaining compliance with federal court judgments that remedy constitutional\nviolations unquestionably justifies whatever burden on expression has occurred.\n[Citation.] The council members remain free to express their views on all aspects of\nhousing in Yonkers.

It does not stand for the\nproposition that a state statute cannot require a prima facie showing of merit before a\nclaim arising from certain categories of speech goes forward.

According to\nNasha, “It is recognized that ‘administrative decision makers are drawn from the\ncommunity at large. Especially in a small town setting they are likely to have knowledge\nof and contact or dealings with parties to the proceeding. Holding them to the same\nstandard as judges, without a showing of actual bias or the probability of actual bias, may\ndiscourage persons willing to serve and may deprive the administrative process of\ncapable decision makers.’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Thus, “in order to prevail on a claim of\nbias violating fair hearing requirements,” a plaintiff “must establish ‘“an unacceptable\nprobability of actual bias on the part of those who have actual decisionmaking power\nover their claims.”’ [Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n                                              25\n\f       In Underground Contractors, the court explained, “‘[B]ias in an administrative\nhearing context can never be implied, and the mere suggestion or appearance of bias is\nnot sufficient. [Citation.] It is also well established that a party is not denied an impartial\nadjudicator merely because an administrative entity performs both the functions of\nprosecutor and judge. [Citation.] Overlapping investigatory, prosecutorial and\nadjudicatory functions do not necessarily deny a fair hearing and are common before\nmost administrative boards. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Underground Contractors, supra,\n108 Cal.App.4th at p. 549.) With these considerations in mind, the Underground\nContractors court held that city council members who were presiding over a debarment\nhearing were not per se biased because the contractor had sued the city. The court noted\nthat the city council members had no pecuniary interest in the lawsuit, and it concluded\nby stating that when “‘an administrative body has a duty to act, and is the only entity\ncapable of acting, the fact that the body may have an interest in the result does not\ndisqualify it from acting. The rule of necessity precludes a claim of bias from the\nstructure of the process.’ [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 550.)\n       Given Nasha and Underground Contractors, and given the absence of any cases\nprohibiting the Trustees from presiding over a debarment hearing in this factual context,\nthey contend that they could not have known that authorizing a cross-complaint in the\nHickman Action disqualified them from presiding over the debarment hearing. The FTR\nParties, on the other hand, contend that the Trustees violated the clearly established rule\nthat a contractor facing debarment has a constitutional right to an impartial decision\nmaker. (Golden Day School, Inc. v. State Dept. of Education (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n709 (Golden Day).)\n       There was no evidence of actual bias presented in connection with the first anti-\nSLAPP motion, which predated the First Amendment retaliation claim. At most, this is a\n“probability of bias” case. While there is a general rule set forth in Golden Day requiring\nthat a decision maker be impartial, there are no state or federal cases, nor are there any\nstatutes, specifically on point. The emergent question, then, is whether the Trustees\nshould have known that procedural due process required that they recuse themselves from\n\n                                              26\n\fthe debarment hearing because there was an unacceptable probability of bias. We think\nnot. They are called upon to conduct the District’s business and make decisions about\ncontractors and projects. Undeniably, they have overlapping investigatory and\nadjudicatory function. Per the Underground Contractors court, such an overlapping of\nfunction does not necessarily deny a fair hearing. Significantly, as that case establishes,\nlitigation between a public agency and an administrative litigant does not disqualify the\npublic agency from acting. Assuming without deciding that constitutional law required\nthe Trustees to disqualify themselves, it goes too far to charge the Trustees with that\nknowledge. If they made a mistake of law, it was not so obvious as to defeat qualified\nimmunity. This is because the precise contours of due process in the administrative\ncontext are flexible and ever evolving.\n       We reach the same conclusion regarding the Trustees’ failure to rule on\naffirmative defenses. The FTR Parties have not cited any cases that required a ruling,\nand we are aware of none. A review of the administrative record reveals that they were\npermitted to present evidence on their affirmative defenses, and the Trustees voted based\non the entire record. This procedure allowed the FTR Parties to preserve their affirmative\ndefenses for judicial review. While the FTR Parties were entitled to procedural\nsafeguards, “there [was] no constitutional entitlement to the full panoply of judicial trial\nprocedures” (Underground Contractors, supra, 108 Cal.App.4th at pp. 542–543). Thus,\nassuming the law required a ruling on the affirmative defenses, the Trustees cannot be\ncharged with anticipating such a rule.\n       D. There is a Probability of Prevailing on the Retaliation Claim.\n       When a plaintiff sues public officials under section 1983 and alleges retaliation for\nthe exercise of First Amendment rights, the plaintiff “must establish that (1) it engaged in\nexpressive conduct that addressed a matter of public concern; (2) the government\nofficials took an adverse action against it; and (3) its expressive conduct was a substantial\nor motivating factor for the adverse action.

This “rule applies to invidious discrimination as\nwell—whether it consists of a single act or a pattern of conduct. Disputes over racial,\nreligious, or other such discrimination by public officials are not simply individual\npersonnel matters. They involve the type of governmental conduct that affects the\nsocietal interest as a whole—conduct in which the public has a deep and abiding interest.\nLitigation seeking to expose such wrongful governmental activity is, by its very nature, a\nmatter of public concern.” (Id. at pp. 926–927.)\n       We conclude that Katbi’s letter dated October 5, 2011, was a matter of public\nconcern because it sought to expose racism, retaliation, corruption and fraud by Payinda\nin connection with a public project, and because it accused the District of acting in bad\nfaith when rejecting a low bid. Also, the letter responded to newspaper articles, which\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fdemonstrated that the topic of the FTR Parties’ reputation and performance on public\ncontracts was newsworthy.\n              2. Adverse Action.\n       The trustees voted to debar the FTR Parties. That qualifies as adverse action\nbecause it is reasonably likely to deter their complaints about government corruption and\nmisconduct. (Coszalter, supra, 320 F.3d at p. 970 [in a First Amendment retaliation case,\nan adverse action “is an act that is reasonably likely to deter” a person “from engaging in\nconstitutionally protected speech”].)\n       The Trustees contend that due to the trial court’s decision to grant the petition for\nwrit of mandate and undo the debarment, there is no official action upon which the FTR\nParties’ claim can be based.

Her survivors sued the\nparole board under section 1983 and alleged that when it released the parolee, it subjected\nthe girl to a deprivation of life without due process of law. The court rejected the theory\non the grounds that the girl’s death was too remote a consequence of the parole board’s\nactions. In particular, the court noted that the parolee was not an agent of the parole\nboard, and the parole board was not aware that the girl faced any special danger.\n(Martinez, supra, 444 U.S. at pp. 284–285.)\n       After the plaintiff in Ketchum was raped by an inmate who escaped from a\nrehabilitation facility, she sued various entities and officers under section 1983. She\nclaimed that they were grossly negligent in failing to maintain security, and they\ntherefore deprived her of the constitutional right to privacy and security of property.\n(Ketchum, supra, 811 F.2d at p. 1244.) Citing Martinez, the Ketchum court held the\nplaintiff did not have a viable federal civil rights claim because the state did not deprive\nher of a constitutional right. (Ketchum, supra, at p. 1247.)\n       The Trustees’ votes led directly to the FTR Parties’ injuries, so it cannot\nreasonably be argued that their actions were too remote.

It was explained in Gilbrook v. City of Westminster (9th\nCir. 1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764216\"><a href=\"/opinion/764216/paul-gilbrook-michael-garrison-don-herr-hal-raphael-dana-bowler-joe-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (Gilbrook) that anyone who causes a citizen to be subjected\nto a constitutional deprivation is liable under section 1983. The “‘requisite causal\nconnection can be established not only by some kind of direct personal participation in\nthe deprivation, but also by setting in motion a series of acts by others which the actor\nknows or reasonably should know would cause others to inflict the constitutional injury.’\n[Citation.]” (Gilbrook, supra, 177 F.3d at p. 854.)\n       To the degree the Trustees suggest that the writ of mandate erases any misconduct,\nthe suggestion lacks legal support.\n              3. Substantial or Motivating Factor.\n       Federal law establishes that to prove that First Amendment “retaliation was a\nsubstantial or motivating factor behind an adverse employment action, a plaintiff may\nintroduce evidence that (1) the speech and adverse action were proximate in time, such\nthat a jury could infer that the action took place in retaliation for the speech; (2) the\nemployer expressed opposition to the speech, either to the speaker or to others; or (3) the\nproffered explanations for the adverse action were false and pretextual.” (Ellins, supra,\n710 F.3d at p. 1062.)\n       Here, in a letter dated October 17, 2011, the District notified FTR and Katbi that\nthe Board would be holding a hearing in December 2011 to determine whether to debar\nthem for up to five years. That letter was issued soon after Katbi’s October 5, 2011,\nletter. On January 10, 2012, after a hearing, the Trustees’ committee recommended\ndebarment. Less than a month later, the Trustees voted to debar FTR for five years.\nBecause the District’s letter, the recommendation and the debarment were so close in\ntime to Katbi’s letter, a jury could infer that the decision to hold a hearing and consider\ndebarment was retaliation for Katbi’s speech. (Coszalter, supra, 320 F.3d at p. 978\n[adverse action taking place three to eight months after the plaintiff speech supports an\ninference of retaliation].)\n       Other facts bolster the inference of retaliation.\n\n                                              30\n\f         For example, the committee report stated: “FTR . . . argues that it was targeted by\n[Payinda] and that [Payinda] made racist remarks about FTR including referring to it as\n‘sand niggers and towel heads.’ The Committee finds such language patently offensive\nand inexcusable. [Payinda], the person who FTR alleges said such things, vehemently\ndenies he ever made such comments. . . . The Committee also notes that FTR made the\nexact same allegations on another public works project for the Rio School District in\nOxnard, California[,] which took place over 10 years ago. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] While the\nDistrict would never condone any racist conduct, it is difficult for the Committee to\nbelieve that on two completely separate projects in two different counties and years apart,\ntwo different persons would undertake to reject work and harass FTR based solely on\nracial bias[,] and that these two persons would use identical racist remarks against FTR.\nHowever distasteful such comments are, what is also distasteful is a contractor’s apparent\npractice of using the allegation of racism to deflect responsibility for the quality of its\nwork.” Thus, it is apparent that the committee expressed opposition to some of Katbi’s\nstatements.\n         Furthermore, in the context of the other facts mentioned, the Board conducted the\ndebarment proceeding in a manner suggesting that it stacked the deck against the FTR\nParties. It refused a continuance that would have enabled the FTR Parties to prepare an\nexpert regarding charge III; at the committee hearing on January 10, 2012, the committee\nmembers failed to discuss the elements of fraud; the committee members refused to rule\non the affirmative defenses; and the Trustees voted to debar for five years instead of\nfollowing the committee recommendation that the FTR Parties be debarred for only three\nyears.\n         To block our consideration of the letter, the Trustees cite Continental Ins.

According to the Trustees, the FAC and the TAC are\nfatally inconsistent regarding the motive for debarment, i.e., whether it was motivated by\nthe Los Angeles Times articles or Katbi’s letter.\n       We perceive no inconsistency. The FAC alleged facts related to the Los Angeles\nTimes articles, but it did not allege that the debarment was motivated by those articles.\nAt most, the FAC could be construed as implying that the articles were a motivating\nfactor. That does not contradict the allegation in the TAC that the debarment was\nretaliation for Katbi’s letter. The Trustees’ real complaint seems to be that the TAC is\ninconsistent with the FTR Parties’ ex parte application for a temporary restraining order/\ninjunction and motion for peremptory writ, in which they argued that the articles\nprompted an investigation, and that the Board debarred the FTR Parties to obtain good\npress. But the Trustees have cited no rule that would penalize the FTR Parties by\nforbidding them from alleging something different in a subsequently amended complaint.\nAnd, in any event, the FTR Parties never argued that the Los Angeles Times articles were\nthe only motivating factor, which allows room for additional motivating factors.\n       The Trustees’ next argument is also unavailing. They posit that there is no\nlikelihood of the FTR Parties prevailing because the evidence does not suggest that the\nDistrict’s staff was motivated by Katbi’s letter to recommend debarment proceedings.\nBut a press release from the District indicated that the Board had sent letters to two major\nDistrict contractors instituting proceedings that could potentially terminate their contracts\nwith the District’s building program. Also according to the press release, which was\nissued after Katbi’s October 5, 2011, letter was sent, the Board had instructed its\nChancellor to take whatever actions were necessary to reform the building program, root\nout mismanagement and waste, and ensure that taxpayers were getting full value for the\nmoney invested in community college campuses. From the timing of the letter, press\nrelease, debarment hearing and debarment, a jury could infer that the District’s staff\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\finitiated charges to further the Trustees’ agenda of retaliating against the FTR Parties for\nKatbi’s speech.18\n       The Trustees aver that FTR’s claim is baseless because there is no evidence that\nthey were aware of the letter. We note, however, that the letter was addressed to the\nattention of each individual Trustee. A jury would be entitled to infer that the Trustees\nknew of the letter.\n       Our task is to determine whether the FTR Parties’ claim has minimal merit.\n(Oasis West Realty, LLC v.

Qualified Immunity.\n       The Trustees argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because there was\nno clearly established indication that the discretionary decision to vote to debar the FTR\nParties violated any constitutional rights. This argument misstates the issue. The issue is\nwhether it was clearly established that Katbi’s letter addressed an issue of public concern,\nand that it was unconstitutional to debar the FTR Parties in retaliation for Katbi’s exercise\nof his First Amendment rights in that letter.\n       Here, the Trustees had fair warning at the time they voted to debar the FTR Parties\nthat it could not do so in retaliation for Katbi’s letter. Case law established that\nindependent contractors enjoy First Amendment protection (Bd. of County Comm’rs v.\nUmbehr (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118059\"><a href=\"/opinion/118059/board-of-commrs-wabaunsee-cty-v-umbehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (Umbehr)), and that speech addresses a matter of\npublic concern if it relates to any matter of political, social or other concern to the\ncommunity such as corruption, wrongdoing or misconduct by government agents, or if it\nwas a subject of legitimate news interest. (Sydner, supra, 562 U.S. at p. 452; Alpha,\nsupra, 381 F.3d at p. 926.) It also established that a public official cannot retaliate\nagainst a public contractor for exercising its First Amendment rights. (Id. at p. 923;\nUmbehr, supra, 518 U.S. at p. 685 [a public entity cannot terminate a preexisting\nrelationship with an independent government contractor in retaliation for exercising First\nAmendment rights].)\n              6. Absolute Immunity.\n       Under federal jurisprudence, judges have absolute immunity from suit under\nsection 1983. (Cleavinger v. Saxner (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111547\"><a href=\"/opinion/111547/cleavinger-v-saxner/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 199.) This immunity has been\nextended “to certain others who perform functions closely associated with the judicial\nprocess” such as lawyers and witnesses. (Id. at p. 200.) Per the language of Butz v.\nEconomou (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109932\"><a href=\"/opinion/109932/butz-v-economou/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 512 (Butz), absolute immunity is “necessary to assure\nthat judges, advocates, and witnesses can perform their respective functions without\nharassment or intimidation.”\n       Immunity is justified because the “safeguards built into the judicial process tend to\nreduce the need for private damages actions as a means of controlling unconstitutional\n\n                                                35\n\fconduct. The insulation of the judge from political influence, the importance of\nprecedent in resolving controversies, the adversary nature of the process, and the\ncorrectability of error on appeal are just a few of the many checks on malicious action by\njudges. Advocates are restrained not only by their professional obligations, but by the\nknowledge that their assertions will be contested by their adversaries in open court.\nJurors are carefully screened to remove all possibility of bias. Witnesses are . . . subject\nto the rigors of cross-examination and the penalty of perjury. Because these features of\nthe judicial process tend to enhance the reliability of information and the impartiality of\nthe decisionmaking process, there is a less pressing need for individual suits to correct\nconstitutional error.” (Butz, supra, 438 U.S. at p. 512.)\n       We conclude that the Trustees are not entitled to absolute immunity. Unlike a\njudge, who would be subject to disqualification under Code of Civil Procedure sections\n170.1 and 170.6 if he or she was biased against a party, the Trustees were not subject to\ndisqualification. The result in this case was that the Trustees, having authorized a lawsuit\nagainst FTR, were in the position of presiding over issues that they had arguably\nprejudged. Prehearing discovery was not permitted. A review of the committee’s ruling\nand findings indicates that it lacked legal training and was essentially indifferent to legal\nprecedent. Instead of having a command of the legal issues presented, the committee\nrelied heavily on Orbach and Goulet for guidance and therefore lacked the independence\nof thought that is the hallmark of judicial office. Thus, we conclude that the debarment\nhearing lacked essential safeguards necessary to reduce the need for private damages\nactions as a means for controlling unconstitutional conduct.\n       Additionally, while a judge does no more than enforce the law or preside over\ndisputes between third parties, the Trustees decided whether the District, as a consumer\nof construction services and a participant in the marketplace, would consider bids from\nthe FTR Parties for five years. In that sense, the Trustees did not perform a function that\nis closely associated with the judicial process. A statement by Trustee Park during the\nhearing before the committee highlights the point. She stated, “You know, we’re not\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\flawyers; we’re not judges here. We’re trying to do the best . . . for our constituents in\nprotecting the public works in our contracts.”\n       The Trustees suggest that Butz and Buckles v. King County (9th Cir. 1999)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766199\"><a href=\"/opinion/766199/bruce-buckles-linda-buckles-and-alvin-banks-v-king-county-a-political/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Buckles) dictate a finding of absolute immunity. We disagree because\nthey are materially distinguishable. At issue in Butz was an administrative hearing\nconducted before a hearing officer who was enforcing the law rather than deciding\nwhether a public entity would enter into future public contracts with a defendant. Unlike\nthe Trustees, who are appointed, the hearing officer in Butz was insulated from political\ninfluence. Last, the parties in Butz had a right that the FTR Parties did not have, i.e., the\nparties in Butz were entitled to know the findings and conclusions on all of the issues of\nfact, law and discretion. (Butz, supra, 438 U.S. at pp. 512–513.) The proceedings in\nBuckles reflected “the same characteristics of the judicial process identified as sufficient\nin Butz.” (Buckles, supra, 191 F.3d at p. 1134.) Also, the procedures in Buckles\nprovided “for disqualification of the Board members for bias and prejudice.” (Id. at\np. 1134.) No such procedure was available here.\nV. The Official Capacity Section 1983 Claims; the Taxpayer Claim.\n       Pursuant to taxpayer claim in the FAC, the FTR Parties sought to enjoin the\nDistrict from unlawfully debarring the FTR Parties and violating its state and federal\nconstitutional rights.20 As well, the FAC alleged: “There is an actual controversy\nbetween plaintiffs and defendants concerning their respective rights and duties in that\nplaintiffs contend that the policies and practices of defendants . . . are in violation of state\nand federal law and contrary to the factual circumstances, as alleged herein, whereas\ndefendants contend in all respects to the contrary.”\n\n\n20\n        Code of Civil Procedure section 526a provides in relevant part: “An action to\nobtain a judgment, restraining and preventing any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or\ninjury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a county, town, city or city and county of\nthe State, may be maintained against any officer thereof, or any agent, or other person,\nacting in its behalf, either by a citizen resident therein, or by a corporation, who is\nassessed for and is liable to pay, or, within one year before the commencement of the\naction, has paid, a tax therein.”\n\n                                               37\n\f       In the procedural due process claim in the FAC, the FTR Parties were seeking\nrelief that would enjoin the Trustees from “engaging in each of the unlawful practices,\npolicies, customs and usages” alleged, and from “using any of the charges or accusations\nasserted in the debarment proceeding to take any negative actions against [the FTR\nParties], including but not limited to initiating further debarment proceedings . . . ,\nseeking to label [the FTR Parties] . . . as ‘non-responsible’ bidders with respect to any\n[District] projects, invoking the ‘convenience’ clause to terminate any outstanding\ncontract, or making any public or official statements [about the FTR Parties] or any of\ntheir agents or principals[.]”\n       The TAC requested the same relief. Thus, the relief was requested in part due to\nthe First Amendment retaliation claim.\n       Fairly understood, the taxpayer and official capacity claims arise out of the\ndebarment hearing, the debarment and the termination of FTR’s contracts. These were\nacts of governance by the District. Applying the anti-SLAPP statute to these types of acts\nwould chill challenges to governmental action. Based on San Ramon, we hold that the\nanti-SLAPP statute does not apply.\nVI. The Interference Claims; the Negligence Claim.\n       The Trustees contend that the second anti-SLAPP motion should have been\ngranted as to the state tort claims because they are immune from liability under\nGovernment Code sections 820.2 and 820.9.\n       We agree.\n       A. Immunity for Act of Discretion.\n       “Except as otherwise provided by statute, a public employee is not liable for an\ninjury resulting from his act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the\nexercise of the discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.” (Gov.\nCode, § 820.2.)\n       The FTR Parties argue that the Trustees’ decision to debar nonresponsible bidders\nis not discretionary. We cannot concur. Pursuant to Public Contract Code section 20651,\nsubdivision (b), the governing board of a community college district must award a\n\n                                              38\n\fcontract for a public project to the lowest responsible bidder. The District has discretion\nto determine which bidders are responsible. (Stacy & Witbeck, Inc. v. City and County of\nSan Francisco (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2244715\"><a href=\"/opinion/2244715/stacy-witbeck-v-cty-cty-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

[Citation.]” (Golden Day,\nsupra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 704.) Viewed properly, debarment is not an obligation; it is a\ndiscretionary tool at the District’s disposal.\n       Regardless of whether the debarment was discretionary, the FTR Parties contend\nthat it does not fall within Government Code section 820.2 because it was an operational\ndecision rather than a policy decision.\n       Under California common law, a governmental official had “personal immunity\nfrom lawsuits challenging his or her discretionary acts within the scope of authority.\n[Citation.]” (Caldwell v.

When the Legislature enacted the Tort Claims Act, it codified the\ntraditional immunity for discretionary acts in Government Code section 820.2.\n(Caldwell, supra, at p. 980.) Our Supreme Court explained that the “immunity is\nreserved for those basic policy decisions which have . . . been [expressly] committed to\ncoordinate branches of government[.]” (Caldwell, supra, at p. 981.) In contrast, “there is\nno basis for immunizing lower-level, or ‘ministerial,’ decisions that merely implement a\nbasic policy already formulated. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) Consequently, “immunity applies\nonly to deliberate and considered policy decisions, in which a ‘[conscious] balancing [of]\nrisks and advantages . . . took place.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1341–1342, “A determination that a bidder is responsible is a\ncomplex matter dependent, often, on information received outside the bidding process\nand requiring, in many cases, an application of subtle judgment. Not only is the process\n\n\n\n                                              40\n\fcomplex, but the declaration of nonresponsibility may have an adverse impact on the\nprofessional or business reputation of the bidder.”\n       In the words of Golden Day, “Debarment is never a matter of small moment.”\n(Golden Day, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 703.) Quoting a federal case dating back to\n1970, Golden Day adopted the recognition that the consequences of debarment “‘will\nvary, depending upon multiple factors: the size and prominence of the contractor, the\nratio of his government business to non-government business; the length of his\ncontractual relationship with government; his dependence on that business; his ability to\nsecure other business as a substitute for government business. . . . The impact of\ndebarment on a contractor may be a sudden contraction of bank credit, adverse impact on\nmarket price of shares of listed stock, if any, and critical uneasiness of creditors\ngenerally, to say nothing of “loss of face” in the business community. These\nconsequences are in addition to the loss of specific profits from the business denied as a\nresult of debarment.’” (Id. at pp. 703–704.)\n       Based on the foregoing authorities, we conclude that the Trustees’ decision to\ndebar the FTR Parties involved a discretionary policy decision as to whether to trust the\nFTR Parties with public projects and millions of dollars for five years. The decision\nrequired the Trustees to form a considered opinion about the impact of debarring or not\ndebarring the FTR Parties on the District and its existing contracts. Other than requiring\na fair hearing before a debarment, it would be unseemly for courts to interfere in the\nDistrict’s debarment decisions (Caldwell, supra, 10 Cal.4th at p. 981) because a\ndebarment occurs at the planning stage, i.e., it constitutes a plan regarding who will or\nwill not be eligible to build public projects. If the decision not to award a public contract\nis protected by immunity, as established in Pacific Architects and Curcini, then certainly\nthe decision to debar a contractor and not award any contracts to that contractor for a set\nperiod of time is protected by immunity.21\n\n21\n      Moreover, we find no meaningful distinction between this case and Ogborn v. City\nof Lancaster (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2260756\"><a href=\"/opinion/2260756/ogborn-v-city-of-lancaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, the court held that a public official\ncharged with administering a city’s nuisance abatement program was entitled to\n\n                                              41\n\f       B. Immunity for Act of a Public Entity.\n       Government Code section 820.9 provides in relevant part that “members of\ngoverning boards of . . . local public entities . . . are not vicariously liable for injuries\ncaused by the act or omission of the public entity or advisory body. Nothing in this\nsection exonerates an official from liability for injury caused by that individual’s own\nwrongful conduct.” (Gov. Code, § 820.9.) A local public entity “includes a county, city,\ndistrict, public authority, public agency, and any other political subdivision or public\ncorporation in the State, but does not include the State.” (Gov. Code, § 900.4.) Under\nthese statutes the District is a local public entity, and the Trustees are therefore members\nof a governing board of a local public entity.\n       We conclude that the Trustees are entitled to immunity. The disruption of FTR’s\ncontracts and relationships was caused by the debarment, which was an action taken by\nthe District. Through its interference claims, the FTR Parties seek to hold the Trustees\nvicariously liable for the District’s action.\n       The FTR Parties urge us to conclude that the Trustees are being sued not for the\ndebarment by the District but for their own wrongful conduct in casting votes designed to\ndebar them without procedural due process and in retaliation for Katbi’s exercise of First\nAmendment rights. We decline. “Courts are reluctant to attribute to the Legislature an\nintent to create ‘an illogical or confusing scheme’ [citation]; legislative policy is best\neffectuated by avoiding those constructions which lead to mischief or absurdity.”\n(People v. Jeffers (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1143730\"><a href=\"/opinion/1143730/people-v-jeffers/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998–999.) If we were to construe the statute as\nthe FTR Parties suggest, then the exception would swallow the rule. Even if the\nmembers of governing boards could not be sued for the acts of local public entities, they\ncould be sued for causing those acts, and their exposure to liability would be no different\nthan if the immunity provided in Government Code section 820.9 did not exist.\n\n\n\n\nimmunity after “making the discretionary policy decision to declare [a property] a\nnuisance.” (Id. at p. 461.) Debarring a contractor is no less a policy decision than\ndeclaring that a nuisance exists.\n\n                                                42\n\fVII. Attorney Fees.\n       Subdivision (c)(1) of the anti-SLAPP statute provides that if the trial court “finds\nthat a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary\ndelay, the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney’s fees to a plaintiff prevailing\non the motion, pursuant to [Code of Civil Procedure] Section 128.5.” Based on this\nstatutory provision, the trial court awarded attorney fees. This was error.\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 128.5, subdivision (b)(2) defines frivolous to\nmean “totally and completely” without merit, or for the “sole” purpose of harassing the\nopposing party. “When a motion has partial merit, it is not ‘totally and completely’\nwithout merit, nor can it be said that its ‘sole’ purpose is to harass.” (Gerbosi v. Gaims,\nWeil, West & Epstein, LLP (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450.)22\n       This opinion establishes that the first anti-SLAPP motion should have been\ngranted as to the personal capacity due process claim. Thus, the motion had at least\npartial merit, and it was not frivolous.\nVIII. The Trial Judge.\n       The Board and Trustees request that we “consider whether in the interests of\njustice [we] should direct that further proceedings be heard before a trial judge other\nthan” the trial judge who ruled on their motions. (Code Civ. Proc., § 170.1, subd. (c).)\nThey contend that disqualification is mandated because the trial judge demonstrated\nanimus inconsistent with judicial objectivity and, therefore, a reasonable man would\nentertain doubts concerning the trial judge’s impartiality. (People v. Enriquez (2008) 160\n\n\n22\n        The FTR Parties suggest, and the trial court found, that the frivolous nature of the\nfirst anti-SLAPP motion is established, in part, because the District and Trustees violated\na stipulation. After the FAC was filed, the parties stipulated to an extension of the\ndeadline for the District and Trustees to file any pleading responsive to the FAC. In\naddition, the FTR Parties were given until the deadline to file a second amended\ncomplaint. On the same day the stipulation was signed, and without notice to the FTR\nParties, the District and Trustees filed the first anti-SLAPP motion seeking an order\nstriking the FAC. The trial court found that this action raised the inference that the sole\npurpose of the motion was to harass. Given that the motion had partial merit, any such\ninference is negated.\n\n                                             </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 244.) After reviewing the record, we conclude that this is not one of\nthose rare cases where the trial judge should be disqualified.\n       All other issues raised by the parties are moot.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The orders denying the anti-SLAPP motions are reversed in part and affirmed in\npart. On remand, the trial court is instructed to grant the motions as to the personal\ncapacity claim under section 1983 for the denial of procedural due process, the claim for\nintentional interference with contract and/or prospective economic advantage, and the\nclaim for negligence. Under section 1983, the official capacity claims for denial of\nprocedural due process and First Amendment retaliation as well as the personal capacity\nclaim for First Amendment retaliation may proceed. So, too, can the taxpayer claim\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 526a. The award of attorney fees in connection\nwith the first anti-SLAPP motion is reversed.\n       The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n       NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS.\n\n\n\n\n                                          __________________________, Acting P.
