See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R.\n34.1(G ). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\fEBEL, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n      Plaintiff-Appellant Jesse Trujillo, a pro se prisoner proceeding in forma\n\npauperis, filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim against various New M exico and\n\nVirginia corrections officials 1 alleging that they violated his constitutional rights\n\nby: 1) improperly classifying and segregating him; 2) denying him access to legal\n\nmaterials and the courts; 3) providing him with a nutritionally inadequate diet;\n\n\n      1\n          M r. Trujillo’s complaint names “Defendant Institutional Classification\nAuthority” as a party to this suit. W e liberally construe that designation as\nasserting claims against an unnamed Virginia official referred to by the title\n“Institution Classification Authority” at W allens Ridge State Prison rather than\nasserting a claim against a state agency. See ANR Pipeline Co. v. Lafaver, 150\nF.3d 1178, 1187 (10th Cir. 1998) (“[A] citizen’s suit against a state agency is\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment just as surely as if the suit had named the\nstate itself. Furthermore, it does not matter what form of relief a citizen might\nrequest in a suit against a state agency . . . .”) (citing Pennhurst State Sch. &\nHosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100 (1984)). M r. Trujillo’s complaint further\nsuggests that he intended to sue an individual, not an agency. In the section\nlisting the parties, he wrote:\n\n      Defendant Institutional Classification Authority is a citizen of Virginia\n      whose address is P.O. Box 759, Big Stone Gap, Virginia 24219. And\n      who is imployed [sic] as the Institutional Classification Authority of\n      W allens Ridge State Prison, Virginia department of corrections. At the\n      time the claims alleged in this C omplaint this defendant was acting\n      under color of state law as Classification Authority of W allens Ride\n      State Prison.     He is legally responsible for fair and im partial\n      recommendations of classification decision to the warden for all\n      prisoners at W allens Ridge State Prison.\n\nAccordingly, we interpret M r. Trujillo to allege claims only against officials of\nVirginia and New M exico, rather than the state or a state agency.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fand 4) treating him differently than other inmates. The district court sua sponte\n\nordered that “Plaintiff’s claims against the N ew M exico D efendants are\n\nDISM ISSED with prejudice; Plaintiff’s claims against the Virginia D efendants\n\nare DISM ISSED without prejudice,” pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2) and Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Review ing the district court’s dismissal de novo, we affirm\n\nin part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n      M r. Trujillo is a New M exico state prisoner who was transferred by the\n\nNew M exico Department of Corrections (NM DC) to W allens Ridge State Prison\n\n(W RSP) in Virginia on April 12, 2002. Immediately upon his arrival, WRSP held\n\na classification hearing at which M r. Trujillo was not permitted to present\n\nevidence, allegedly in violation of V irginia Departmental Operating Procedure\n\n821. 2 After the hearing, W RSP placed M r. Trujillo in segregation claiming that\n\nhe was a threat to the prison. M r. Trujillo’s initial appeal to the warden was\n\ndenied, but the regional director of the Virginia Department of Corrections\n\n(VDOC) determined M r. Trujillo’s subsequent grievance was founded and\n\ninformed M r. Trujillo that “appropriate administrative action ha[d] been taken.”\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         To the extent that M r. Trujillo “seeks relief for alleged violations of state\nstatutes and prison regulations . . . , he has stated no cognizable claim under\n§ 1983,” which establishes a cause of action only for deprivation of rights secured\nby the Constitution or federal law. Gaines v. Stenseng, 292 F.3d 1222, 1225\n(10th Cir. 2002); see also Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 150 (1970).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fM r. Trujillo’s classification, however, remained the same and no new hearing was\n\nconducted.\n\n      On July 9, 2002, at a second classification hearing during which M r.\n\nTrujillo was again not allowed to present witnesses or evidence, he was placed in\n\nsegregation under the explanation that he “need[ed] a longer period of\n\nadjustment;” “New M exico inmate.” M r. Trujillo appealed this decision on the\n\ngrounds that he had been in segregation for over 100 days when the average stay\n\nfor new arrivals in segregation was days or weeks; his appeal was denied by the\n\nwarden and the regional director. As a result, M r. Trujillo spent nearly a year in\n\nsegregation.\n\n      On M arch 9, 2003, M r. Trujillo wrote a letter to another regional director\n\nexplaining that he had been classified in a prejudicial and discriminatory manner\n\nbecause no Virginia or other out-of-state prisoner housed at W RSP w as classified\n\nin the same manner as he had been classified, nor housed in segregation for this\n\nlength of time, and requested that the director intervene. According to M r.\n\nTrujillo, the average stay in segregation for other prisoners at W RSP is less than a\n\nmonth, and prisoners rarely remain in segregation even for the most serious\n\noffenses for more than 180 days and usually only for sixty to ninety days. M r.\n\nTrujillo explained to the director that he had been in segregation for more than\n\n750 days. The letter was returned stating that his appeal to the director did not\n\nmeet the criteria for a Level III response.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      On M arch 26, 2003, W RSP changed the rationale for M r. Trujillo’s\n\nsegregation to “inmate viewed as a threat to W RSP.” M r. Trujillo alleges that no\n\nfurther indication was given as to why he might now be viewed as a threat. And\n\nhe claims that there was no marked change in his behavior to warrant such an\n\nabrupt change in the rationale for keeping him in segregation. 3\n\n      In early M ay 2003, pursuant to Departmental Operating Procedure 821-\n\n7.1A , M r. Trujillo requested an annual review of his classification to assess\n\nwhether a change in his security level and treatment plan was warranted. That\n\nrequest w as denied. In late M ay 2003, M r. Trujillo filed another grievance with\n\nthe VDOC, claiming that he was entitled to a classification review and should not\n\nbe excluded because he was an out-of-state prisoner. In response, the W RSP\n\nwarden stated: “Your initial classification was completed by New M exico. The\n\nVDOC cannot reclassify you unless given permission by New M exico.” The\n\nregional director provided nearly the same response, stating: “Investigation\n\n\n\n\n      3\n         Liberally construed, these allegations may support a claim for retaliation\nagainst the Virginia defendants. See Fogle v. Pierson, 435 F.3d 1252, 1263-64\n(10th Cir. 2006) (stating that “[p]rison officials may not retaliate against or harass\nan inmate because of the inmate’s exercise of his constitutional rights” and noting\nthat “[s]everal circuits have held that a prisoner’s first amendment right to\npetition the government for redress of grievances encompasses the filing of\ninmate administrative appeals”) (quotations, alterations omitted), petition for cert.\nfiled, (U.S. (Apr. 4, 2006) (N o. 06-6669)). However, we do not address this\npossible claim against the Virginia defendants because we ultimately conclude\nthat the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over them.\n\n                                         -5-\n\freveals that you are an inmate from NM DC, therefore, the review s are done in\n\naccordance with policies and procedures from NM CD.”\n\n      In February 2004, in response to another grievance, VDOC informed M r.\n\nTrujillo that “New M exico has authorized the adaptation of all policies and\n\nprocedures adopted by the V DOC for those inmates housed in V irginia. However,\n\nmatters relating to classification are still handled by New M exico.” Following the\n\nwarden’s instructions, M r. Trujillo then wrote to the secretary and the director of\n\nthe NM DC requesting reclassification of his status. He never received a response.\n\n      M r. Trujillo claims that the conditions of his confinement violated his\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, his constitutional\n\nright of access to the courts, and his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and\n\nunusual punishment. Based on these allegations, M r. Trujillo filed this § 1983\n\naction in federal district court for the District of New M exico against various\n\nVirginia and New M exico prison officials.\n\n                                   D ISC USSIO N\n\n      After granting M r. Trujillo in form a pauperis status, the district court,\n\npursuant to § 1915(e)(2), dismissed without prejudice M r. Trujillo’s claims\n\nagainst the Virginia defendants for lack of personal jurisdiction and improper\n\nvenue. It also dismissed with prejudice M r. Trujillo’s claims against the New\n\nM exico defendants under § 1915(e)(2) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. W e review both dismissals de\n\n                                         -6-\n\fnovo. See Perkins v. Kan. Dep’t of Corr., 165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir. 1999)\n\n(holding that a de novo standard governs review of dismissals under § 1915 for\n\nfailure to state a claim); Fogle, 435 F.3d at 1259 (“[W ]here [a] frivolousness\n\ndetermination turns on an issue of law, we review the determination de novo.”).\n\nI. Claims against the V irginia defendants\n\n      The district court concluded that 1) it had no jurisdiction over the Virginia\n\ndefendants because nothing in the complaint indicated any connection between\n\nthe Virginia defendants and the State of New M exico such that in personam\n\njurisdiction could be properly exercised, and 2) “venue [was] improper in this\n\ndistrict.” The court then correctly noted that, “[u]nder these circumstances,\n\nclaims against the Virginia D efendants could be severed and transferred to\n\nVirginia under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) & (3) . . . or\n\ndismissed.” See Doering ex rel. Barrett v. Copper M ountain, Inc., 259 F.3d 1202,\n\n1209 n.3 (10th Cir. 2001) (“The district court had the authority either to dismiss\n\nor transfer the case for improper venue or lack of personal jurisdiction.”). The\n\ndistrict court ordered the latter, dismissing without prejudice all of M r. Trujillo’s\n\nclaims against the V irginia defendants. W e affirm the district court’s\n\njurisdictional decision but vacate and remand its decision to dismiss rather than\n\ntransfer.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f      A. Section 1915 sua sponte dismissal\n\n      Section 1915 contains no express authorization for a dismissal for lack of\n\npersonal jurisdiction or venue. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915. 4 However, we have\n\npreviously held that a district court may, in certain limited circumstances,\n\nproperly dismiss under § 1915 based on an affirmative defense. See Fogle, 435\n\nF.3d at 1258; Fratus v. Deland, 49 F.3d 673, 674-75 (10th Cir. 1995). As the\n\nSupreme Court has described:\n\n      Section 1915(d) [the precursor to § 1915(e)] is designed largely to\n      discourage the filing of, and waste of judicial and private resources\n      upon, baseless lawsuits that paying litigants generally do not initiate\n      because of the costs of bringing suit and because of the threat of\n      sanctions for bringing vexatious suits under Federal Rule of Civil\n      Procedure 11. To this end, the statute accords judges not only the\n      authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal\n      theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint’s\n      factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions\n      are clearly baseless.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n         W e note that there is a split of authority as to whether a court can\nconsider such defenses in dismissing pursuant to § 1915. Compare Sanders v.\nUnited States, 760 F.2d 869, 871 (8th Cir. 1985) (affirming dismissal under\n§ 1915 for want of personal jurisdiction) with Anger v. Revco Drug Co., 791 F.2d\n956, 958 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (per curiam) (“[W]e hold that a pro se complaint may\nnot be dismissed on its face under [§ 1915] solely on the ground that the court\nlacks personal jurisdiction over the defendants.”); Sinwell v. Shapp, 536 F.2d 15,\n19 (3d Cir. 1976) (stating, in dicta, that a court cannot dismiss sua sponte under\n§ 1915 on the grounds of improper venue because venue is a w aivable defense);\ncf. Costlow v. W eeks, 790 F.2d 1486, 1487-88 (9th Cir. 1986) (allowing dismissal\nsua sponte for lack of venue before a responsive pleading had been filed);\nConcession Consultants, Inc. v. M irisch, 355 F.2d 369, 371 (2d Cir. 1966)\n(holding that a district court, in the absence of “extraordinary circumstances,”\nshould not raise sua sponte the issue of improper venue).\n\n                                        -8-\n\fNeitzke v. W illiams, 490 U.S. 319, 327 (1989). 5 In light of these policy\n\nconsiderations, and despite the fact that lack of personal jurisdiction and venue\n\nrepresent defenses that, similar to affirmative defenses, can be waived if not\n\nproperly raised, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(1), we conclude that a district court\n\nmay, in certain limited circumstances described below, dismiss under § 1915 for\n\nlack of personal jurisdiction and for improper venue, as well as for affirmative\n\ndefenses.\n\n      In the context of affirmative defenses, we have cautioned that sua sponte\n\ndismissal on such grounds should be “reserved for those extraordinary instances\n\nwhen the claim’s factual backdrop clearly beckons the defense.” Fratus, 49 F.3d\n\nat 676. The same caution applies to sua sponte dismissals for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction and improper venue.   Accordingly, under § 1915, the district court\n\nmay consider personal jurisdiction and venue sua sponte “only when the defense\n\nis obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required\n\nto be developed.” Fratus, 49 F.3d at 674-75 (quotations, alterations omitted).\n\nAnd the district court may dismiss under § 1915 only if “it is clear that [the\n\n\n\n\n      5\n         The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) made three pertinent\nchanges to section 1915(d). First, dismissal became mandatory. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1915(e). Second, it directed the court to dismiss if it “determine[d]” rather than\nwas “satisfied” that the case met the appropriate dismissal criteria. See id. Third,\nit added “failure to state a claim” as a basis for dismissal. See id.\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).\n\n                                        -9-\n\fplaintiff] can allege no set of facts,” Sanders, 760 F.2d at 871, to support personal\n\njurisdiction or venue.\n\n      B. Personal jurisdiction over the V irginia defendants\n\n      In determining whether a federal court has personal jurisdiction over a\n\ndefendant, the court must determine “(1) w hether the applicable statute\n\npotentially confers jurisdiction by authorizing service of process on the defendant\n\nand (2) whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process.” Peay v.\n\nBellsouth M ed. Assistance Plan, 205 F.3d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000) (quotations\n\nomitted). Because 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not, by itself, confer nationwide service\n\nof process or jurisdiction upon federal district courts to adjudicate claims, Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 4(k)(1)(A) refers us to the New M exico long-arm statute, 6 which is\n\n      6\n          New M exico’s long-arm statute provides, in pertinent part:\n\n      A. Any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of this state, who in\n      person or through an agent does any of the acts enum erated in this\n      subsection thereby submits himself or his personal representative to the\n      jurisdiction of the courts of this state as to any cause of action arising\n      from:\n             (1) the transaction of any business within this state;\n             (2) the operation of a motor vehicle upon the highways of this\n             state;\n             (3) the commission of a tortious act within this state;\n             (4) the contracting to insure any person, property or risk located\n             within this state at the time of contracting;\n             (5) with respect to actions for divorce, separate maintenance or\n             annulment, the circumstance of living in the marital relationship\n             within the state, notwithstanding subsequent departure from the\n             state, as to all obligations arising from alimony, child support or\n             real or personal property settlements under C hapter 40, Article\n                                                                          (continued...)\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\fcoextensive with constitutional limitations imposed by the Due Process Clause.\n\nSee Tercero v. Roman Catholic D iocese, 48 P.3d 50, 54 (N.M . 2002). Thus, if\n\njurisdiction is consistent with the Due Process Clause, then New M exico’s long-\n\narm statute authorizes jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.\n\n       The exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant comports w ith\n\ndue process “‘so long as there exist minimum contacts between the defendant and\n\nthe forum State.’” Intercon, Inc. v. Bell Atl. Internet Solutions, Inc., 205 F.3d\n\n1244, 1247 (10th Cir. 2000) (quoting W orld-W ide Volkswagen Corp. v.\n\nW oodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980)). The minimum contacts necessary for\n\nspecific personal jurisdiction may be established where “the defendant has\n\n‘purposefully directed’ its activities toward the forum jurisdiction and where the\n\nunderlying action is based upon activities that arise out of or relate to the\n\ndefendant’s contacts with the forum.” In re Application to Enforce\n\nAdministrative Subpoenas Duces Tecum of S.E.C. v. Knowles, 87 F.3d 413, 418\n\n(10th Cir. 1996) (quoting Burger King Corp. v.

Trujillo alleged the Virginia defendants to have with\n\nNew M exico are that they received a transferred New M exico prisoner and\n\nimplemented New M exico’s classification and work authorization policies\n\npursuant to the ICC. 10 These alleged contacts are very different from those\n\n\n\n      9\n         “[W]e look to the substance of the pleadings and the course of the\nproceedings in order to determine whether the suit is for individual or official\nliability.” Pride v. Does, 997 F.2d 712, 715 (10th Cir. 1993). Nowhere in his\ncomplaint does M r. Trujillo allege that any Virginia defendants acting in their\npersonal capacities have contacts with the State of New M exico, nor do we\nbelieve he could allege such facts. See Ali v. District of Columbia, 278 F.3d 1, 7\n(D.C. Cir. 2002) (holding that the federal district court in W ashington, D.C.\nlacked personal jurisdiction over Virginia officials sued in their personal\ncapacities by a D.C. inmate transferred to Virginia pursuant to the ICC). W e\ntherefore agree that personal jurisdiction has not been adequately established, and\ncould not be established, over the V irginia defendants in their personal capacities,\nand we proceed to consider the allegations against the Virginia defendants in their\nofficial capacities.\n      10\n           The fact that the Virginia officials’ contact with M r. Trujillo came about\nbecause of a contract between the State of New M exico and the State of Virginia\nis not enough, on its own, to subject the Virginia defendants to suit in New\nM exico. See Calder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783, 790 (1984) (“[Employees’] contacts\nwith [a forum] are not to be judged according to their employer’s activities\nthere. . . .

Hustler M agazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n.13 (1984)\n(“[J]urisdiction over an employee does not automatically follow from jurisdiction\nover the corporation which employees him.”). Similarly, the fact that the Virginia\ndefendants may have acted as agents of the State of New M exico pursuant to the\nICC is also not sufficient, on its own, to give the N ew M exico district court\npower to exercise personal jurisdiction. See Calder, 465 U.S. at 790; Keeton,\n465 U.S. at 781 n.13; see also N.M . Stat. § 31-5-17, art. 4(A); Va. Code Ann.\n§ 53.1-216, art.

Instead, “it is essential in each case that there be some\n\nact by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of\n\nconducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and\n\nprotections of its laws.” Id. at 475 (quoting Hanson v.

Thus, the “quantity and quality” of contacts necessary to\n\npermit the New M exico district court to assert personal jurisdiction over the\n\nVirginia defendants in compliance with due process are not present in this case.\n\nOM I Holdings, Inc. v. Royal Ins. Co., 149 F.3d 1086, 1092 (10th Cir. 1998); see\n\nalso Pro Axess, 428 F.3d at 1278 n.5. Nothing about the V irginia defendants’\n\n“conduct and connection with the forum State [of New M exico],” if any such\n\nconnection exists at all, suggests that the Virginia defendants “should reasonably\n\n[have] anticipate[d] being haled into court [in New M exico].” W orld-W ide\n\n                                          - 17 -\n\fVolksw agen, 444 U.S. at 297. W e therefore hold that the Virginia defendants\n\nlack sufficient contacts w ith New M exico to permit a N ew M exico court to\n\nexercise personal jurisdiction over them. 12\n\n             2.     Traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\n\n      Even assuming sufficient minimum contacts existed, we would still need to\n\ndecide whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction over the Virginia defendants\n\n“comport[s] with ‘fair play and substantial justice.’” Equifax Servs., Inc. v. Hitz,\n\n905 F.2d 1355, 1359 (10th Cir. 1990) (quoting Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476); see\n\nalso OM I, 149 F.3d at 1095 (concluding that the minimum contacts standard was\n\nsatisfied, but holding that exercising personal jurisdiction would offend fair play\n\nand substantial justice). In determining whether a court’s exercise of personal\n\njurisdiction is “‘reasonable’ in light of the circumstances surrounding the case,”\n\nOM I, 149 F.3d at 1091, we look to the follow ing factors:\n\n\n\n\n      12\n         Even where the “purposeful availment” requirement is established, due\nprocess is only satisfied if “the plaintiff’s claim arises out of or results from\nactions by the defendant himself that create a substantial connection with the\nforum state.” Pro Axess, 428 F.3d at 1277. Here, M r. Trujillo alleges only\nmistreatment by individual prison employees occurring completely within the\nState of Virginia. Cf. Sanders, 760 F.2d at 872 (holding that “even if the transfer\n[of an inmate from Kentucky to M issouri] was sufficient to establish minimum\ncontacts” between the Kentucky corrections officials and the State of M issouri,\n“the plaintiff’s cause of action [asserting denial of medical treatment] did not\narise from the act”). M r. Trujillo thus cannot establish the second requirement of\nminimum contacts necessary for specific personal jurisdiction over the Virginia\ndefendants.\n\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\f      (1) the burden on the defendant, (2) the forum state’s interest in\n      resolving the dispute, (3) the plaintiff’s interest in receiving convenient\n      and effective relief, (4) the interstate judicial system’s interest in\n      obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the\n      shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social\n      policies.\n\nPro Axess, 428 F.3d at 1279-80 (quotations omitted). “[T]he weaker the\n\nplaintiff’s showing on minimum contacts, the less a defendant need show in terms\n\nof unreasonableness to defeat jurisdiction.” Id. at 1280 (quotations and alteration\n\nomitted). Even if we got past the minimum contacts analysis, the balance of these\n\nfactors in this case ultimately weighs against allow ing New M exico to exercise\n\npersonal jurisdiction over the V irginia defendants.\n\n      New M exico may have a substantial and legitimate interest in adjudicating\n\na claim of its own prisoner. See OM I, 149 F.3d at 1096 (“States have an\n\nimportant interest in providing a forum in w hich their residents can seek redress\n\nfor injuries caused by out-of-state actors.”). However, Virginia has an equally\n\nstrong, if not greater, interest in how its prisons are run. Additionally, Virginia\n\nhas many, if not all, of the witnesses regarding prison conditions at W RSP and\n\npossibly regarding M r. Trujillo’s classification.\n\n      Furthermore, we see no particular reason to believe that due process\n\nrequires M r. Trujillo to be able to file his suit in a single forum in order to receive\n\nconvenient and effective relief. To the extent that M r. Trujillo must file separate\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\flawsuits in two forums, 13 the New M exico defendants will be held accountable for\n\ntheir conduct in New M exico, and the Virginia defendants w ill be held\n\naccountable for their conduct in Virginia. Cf. Garcia v. Lemaster, 439 F.3d 1215,\n\n1217-18 (10th Cir. 2006) (holding that a N ew M exico inmate housed in California\n\npursuant to the ICC was required to bring in California his civil rights suit\n\nconcerning his incarceration in California and the actions taken by prison officials\n\nin California).\n\n      In short, we conclude both that the Virginia defendants lack sufficient\n\nminimum contacts w ith New M exico and that allowing a New M exico court to\n\nexercise jurisdiction over the Virginia defendants would offend “traditional\n\nconceptions of fair play and substantial justice.” Burger King, 471 U.S. at 464\n\n(quotations, alterations omitted). 14\n\n\n      13\n          Depending on M r. Trujillo’s allegations, he might be able to bring his\nclaims against both the New M exico defendants and the Virginia defendants in\nVirginia because Virginia may have personal jurisdiction over the New M exico\ndefendants to the extent that the Virginia defendants acted as agents for the New\nM exico defendants.

Trujillo’s claims against the Virginia defendants for lack of venue,\n\nwe have directed that, after the enactment of § 1631, where the court determines\n\nthat it lacks jurisdiction and the interests of justice require transfer rather than\n\ndismissal, “[t]he correct course . . . [is] to transfer the action pursuant to\n\n[§ 1631].” Ross, 822 F.2d at 1527. There is no indication that the district court\n\nactually evaluated the possibility of transferring M r. Trujillo’s claims under\n\n§ 1631, and it provided no reasons for dismissing rather than transferring pursuant\n\nto § 1406(a). W here, as here, “[a] district court . . . does not exercise its\n\ndiscretion, or makes a decision without providing reasons, [it] abuses that\n\n      15\n         (...continued)\nthat the plaintiff need not first file a motion to transfer. See Haugh v. Booker,\n210 F.3d 1147, 1150 n. 4 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                          - 22 -\n\fdiscretion.” A RW Exploration Corp. v. Aguirre, 45 F.3d 1455, 1459 (10th Cir.\n\n1995). Accordingly, we remand the issue to the district court for a determination\n\nof whether M r. Trujillo’s claims against the Virginia defendants should be\n\ntransferred rather than dismissed without prejudice pursuant to the federal transfer\n\nstatutes. 16\n\nII. Claims against the New M exico defendants\n\n       Remaining, then, are M r. Trujillo’s claims for monetary and injunctive\n\nrelief against the New M exico defendants in their official and personal capacities.\n\nAlthough the district court did not address the issue of sovereign immunity,\n\n§ 1915 provides that “the court shall dismiss the case at any time if the court\n\ndetermines that . . . the action or appeal . . . seeks monetary relief against a\n\ndefendant who is immune from such relief.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(b)(iii)\n\n(emphasis added). W e therefore address this issue before turning to the merits of\n\nM r. Trujillo’s claims against the N ew M exico defendants.\n\n       A.      Sovereign immunity\n\n\n\n\n       16\n          W e note that factors warranting transfer rather than dismissal, at least\nunder § 1631, include finding that the new action would be time barred, see, e.g.,\nHaugh, 210 F.3d at 1150; that the claims are likely to have merit, see, e.g. id.; and\nthat the original action was filed in good faith rather than filed after “plaintiff\neither realized or should have realized that the forum in which he or she filed was\nimproper,” Trierweiler v. Croxton & Trench Holding Corp., 90 F.3d 1523, 1544\n(10th Cir. 1996). The district court will thus need to consider these factors on\nremand.\n\n                                         - 23 -\n\f      In addition to seeking official capacity equitable relief, M r. Trujillo also\n\nrequests that “NM DC officials be ordered to compensate plaintiff $100 a day for\n\nevery day he was held in segregation illegally without due process.” “A claim for\n\nretroactive monetary reimbursement asserted against state officials,” such as the\n\nNew M exico defendants, “in their official capacities constitutes a suit for\n\nmonetary damages against the state” and is barred by sovereign immunity. Johns\n\nv. Stewart, 57 F.3d 1544, 1553-54 (10th Cir. 1995); see also Edelman v. Jordan,\n\n415 U.S. 651, 663 (1974).\n\n      Congress may abrogate the states’ sovereign immunity through a legitimate\n\nexercise of its Section 5 power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. See M CI\n\nTelecomm. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 216 F.3d 929, 935 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has held that § 1983 does not abrogate state\n\nsovereign immunity. Will v. M ich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989).\n\nFurthermore, we hold that neither Virginia nor New M exico waived its sovereign\n\nimmunity simply by adopting the ICC. See Ali, 278 F.3d at 6-7. As the D.C.\n\nCircuit noted in Ali, the only conceivable waiver language in the ICC is a\n\nprovision that suggests that the compact creates rights enforceable by individual\n\ninmates: “The fact of confinement in a receiving state shall not deprive any\n\ninmate so confined of any legal rights w hich said inmate w ould have had if\n\nconfined in an appropriate institution of the sending state.” N.M . Stat. § 31-5-17,\n\nart. 4(E); Va. Code Ann. § 53.1-216, art. IV(e); see also Ali, 278 F.3d at 7. The\n\n                                         - 24 -\n\fcompact, however, says nothing about how such rights— assuming they\n\nexist— may be enforced. See N.M . Stat. § 31-5-17, art. 4(E); Va. Code Ann.\n\n§ 53.1-216, art. IV(e); see also Ali, 278 F.3d at 7. A “reasonable construction”\n\nwould “suggest that Virginia intended inmates to vindicate any rights through the\n\ntraditional methods of either prospective injunctive relief . . . or damage suits\n\nagainst [defendants] in their personal capacities, neither of which requires waiver\n\nof sovereign immunity.” Ali, 278 F.3d at 7 (citations, quotation omitted); see\n\nalso Alden v. M aine, 527 U.S. 706, 732 (1999) (distinguishing between the\n\nexistence of a legal right under federal law and the “implementation of the law in\n\na manner consistent with the constitutional sovereignty of the States”).\n\n         W e therefore conclude that sovereign immunity bars M r. Trujillo’s claims\n\nagainst the New M exico defendants to the extent that M r. Trujillo seeks damages\n\nfrom these defendants in their official capacities. Accordingly, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of these claims w ith prejudice pursuant to § 1915 on this\n\nbasis.\n\n         B.    M erits of M r. Trujillo’s remaining claims against the New\n               M exico defendants\n\n         Remaining, then, are M r. Trujillo’s claims against the New M exico\n\ndefendants in their official capacities for injunctive relief only, and his claims\n\nagainst the New M exico defendants in their personal capacities for money\n\ndamages. Liberally construing M r. Trujillo’s pro se complaint, Price v. Philpot,\n\n\n\n                                          - 25 -\n\f420 F.3d 1158, 1162 (10th Cir. 2005), we read it to allege against these remaining\n\ndefendants 1) a Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection claim; 2)\n\na denial of the constitutional right of access to the courts claim; and 3) an Eighth\n\nAmendment nutritionally inadequate diet claim. The district court determined\n\nthat no relief could be granted on any of these claims and dismissed them with\n\nprejudice pursuant to § 1915(e)(2) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\n      A district court may dismiss under § 1915 for failure to state a claim if “it\n\nis ‘patently obvious’ that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and\n\nallowing him an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.” Hall v.\n\nBellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) (quotations omitted). “In\n\ndetermining whether dismissal is proper, we must accept the allegations of the\n\ncomplaint as true and we must construe those allegations, and any reasonable\n\ninferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiff.” Perkins, 165 F.3d at 806. Ultimately, we affirm in part, reverse in\n\npart, and remand.\n\n             1.     E ighth A mendment and Fourteenth Am endment claims\n                    arising from M r. Trujillo’s classification into segregation\n\n      M r. Trujillo claims that his classification violated his Eighth Amendment\n\nright to be free from cruel and unusual punishment and his Fourteenth\n\nAmendment right to procedural due process. The district court construed M r.\n\nTrujillo’s complaint as alleging “improper classification” and held that it failed to\n\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\fstate a claim for these constitutional violations because “[M r. Trujillo] has no due\n\nprocess right to a particular classification.”\n\n      The district court is correct that “[c]lassification of [a] plaintiff into . . .\n\nsegregation does not involve deprivation of a liberty interest independently\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause.” Bailey v. Shillinger, 828 F.2d 651, 652\n\n(10th Cir. 1987) (citing Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 468 (1983)). But prison\n\nconditions that “impose[] atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in\n\nrelation to the ordinary incidents of prison life” may create a liberty interest\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484\n\n(1995); see also Talley v. Hesse, 91 F.3d 1411, 1413 (10th Cir. 1996).\n\n      Thus, we have held that a district court errs in sua sponte dismissing a\n\nprisoner’s due process claim under § 1915 if it does not have sufficient evidence\n\nbefore it to “fully address both the duration and degree of the plaintiff’s\n\nrestrictions as compared with other inmates.” See Perkins, 165 F.3d at 809;\n\nGaines, 292 F.3d at 1225-26 (declaring it inappropriate to dismiss a prisoner’s\n\ndue process claim without the benefit of evidence showing that the defendant’s\n\n“segregation mirrors those conditions imposed upon [other] inmates”); cf. Sandin,\n\n515 U.S. at 486 (“Based on a comparison between inmates inside and outside\n\ndisciplinary segregation, the State’s actions in placing [the prisoner] there for 30\n\ndays did not work a major disruption in his environment.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 27 -\n\f      Here, the district court determined that M r. Trujillo failed to state a due\n\nprocess claim despite the lack of any evidence addressing whether M r. Trujillo’s\n\nconfinement was atypical and significant when compared to conditions imposed\n\non other prisoners. M r. Trujillo’s complaint specifically alleges that he spent\n\nover 750 days in segregation and that other inmates remain in segregation for the\n\nmost serious offenses for only 180 days. W here, as here, the prisoner is subjected\n\nto a lengthy period of segregation, the duration of that confinement may itself be\n\natypical and significant. See Gaines, 292 F.3d at 1226 (directing the district court\n\non remand to determine whether the 75-day duration of plaintiff’s confinement in\n\nsegregation is itself atypical and significant); Perkins, 165 F.3d at 809 (requiring\n\nthe district court to have before it evidence that “fully address[es] both the\n\nduration and degree of plaintiff’s restrictions as compared w ith other inmates”\n\nbefore it may sua sponte dismiss a prisoner’s due process claim) (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Colon v. Howard, 215 F.3d 227, 231-32 (2d Cir. 2000)\n\n(recognizing that “the duration of [segregation] is a distinct factor bearing on\n\natypicality and must be carefully considered” and concluding that 305 days in\n\nsuch confinement is atypical and significant).\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\f      W e therefore reverse the dismissal of M r. Trujillo’s due process claim\n\nagainst the New M exico defendants and remand to allow the district court to\n\nconduct the required evidentiary analysis. 17\n\n             2.     Denial of constitutional right of access to the courts\n\n      M r. Trujillo’s “constitutional right of access to the courts is clearly\n\nestablished.” See Treff v. Galetka, 74 F.3d 191, 194 (10th Cir. 1996). To state a\n\nclaim for denial of such a right, M r. Trujillo “must show that any denial or delay\n\nof access to the court prejudiced him in pursuing litigation.” Id.; see also Lewis\n\nv. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 351 (1996) (requiring that “the alleged shortcomings in\n\nthe library” actually hinder a prisoner’s “efforts to pursue a legal claim”).\n\n\n\n\n      17\n          To the extent that M r. Trujillo also raises an Eighth Amendment claim\nchallenging the conditions of his confinement in segregation, we conclude that “it\nis ‘patently obvious’ that [he] could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing\nhim an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.” Hall, 935 F.2d at\n1110 (quotations omitted). M r. Trujillo alleges that, as a result of his\nclassification, he has only limited access to education, employment, religious\nprogramming, housing assignment, recreation time and equipment, the telephone,\nand the commissary. In addition to the fact that M r. Trujillo has not alleged that\nthe responsible prison officials acted w ith “deliberate indifference,” these\nallegations do not demonstrate a deprivation “of the minimal measure of life’s\nnecessities,” as required to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the Eighth Amendment. Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, 1310\n(10th Cir. 1998).\n       To the extent that M r. Trujillo also alleges that the New M exico prison\nofficials violated the ICC, that claim does not constitute a violation of federal law\nand therefore is not actionable under § 1983. See Ghana v. Pearce, 159 F.3d\n1206, 1208 (9th Cir. 1998); Stewart v. M cM anus, 924 F.2d 138, 142 (8th Cir.\n1991).\n\n                                         - 29 -\n\f      In the context of a plaintiff serving time in an out-of-state prison system\n\npursuant to the ICC, “the general rule imposes upon the sending state authorities\n\nthe responsibility for ensuring their prisoners incarcerated in sister state facilities\n\nare afforded access to state courts.” Clayton v. Tansy, 26 F.3d 980, 982 (10th\n\nCir. 1993). Here, New M exico as the sending state bears the “burden of\n\nproviding the required state legal materials.” Id.\n\n      The district court construed M r. Trujillo’s complaint as alleging only\n\n“delays in obtaining certain New M exico legal materials from New M exico” and\n\ndismissed his denial of access to the courts claim because “the Constitution does\n\nnot ensure the access requested by Plaintiff” and because “Plaintiff does not\n\nallege any active interference with his preparation and filing of papers.” See\n\nLewis, 518 U.S. at 351 (describing that a prisoner does not have “an abstract,\n\nfreestanding right to a law library or legal assistance” and therefore “cannot\n\nestablish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that his prison’s law library\n\nor legal assistance program is subpar in some theoretical sense”). The district\n\ncourt misconstrued M r. Trujillo’s complaint and therefore erred in concluding that\n\nhe had not stated a cognizable § 1983 claim for denial of access to the courts\n\nagainst the N ew M exico defendants.\n\n      M r. Trujillo actually alleges that the New M exico defendants violated his\n\nright of access to the courts in two ways. First, as the district court noted, he\n\ncomplains that it takes an average of eighteen days for him to receive requested\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\fmaterial. He also alleges, however, that he is expected to know exactly what he\n\nneeds w ithout any knowledge of what materials might be available to him. This\n\nsecond allegation— an “exact cite” system— may state a viable claim of denial of\n\naccess to the courts. See Clayton, 26 F.3d at 982 (remanding to the trial court\n\nwith instruction to determine whether the exact cite paging system resulted in a\n\ndenial of the right of access to the courts).\n\n      Furthermore, M r. Trujillo alleged a “relevant actual injury.” See Lewis,\n\n518 U.S. at 351. Specifically, he claims that he suffered actual injury because the\n\ndefendants’ actions prevented him from filing a state habeas corpus petition and\n\nfrom challenging the N M CD’s ex post facto changing of his sentence. See id. at\n\n356 (“The tools [the guarantee of access to the courts] requires to be provided are\n\nthose that the inmates need in order to attack their sentences, directly or\n\ncollaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement.”).\n\n      In M cBride v. Deer, 240 F.3d 1287 (10th Cir. 2001), we held that\n\nconclusory allegations were insufficient because, for example, the plaintiff\n\n      did not describe sufficiently the legal materials he was seeking, see\n      Petrick v. M aynard, 11 F.3d 991, 995 (10th Cir. 1993) (noting that “a\n      prisoner must do more than make a mere conclusory allegation of need\n      for unspecified or unlimited materials”); he did not clarify that the\n      [prison] library and its resources were inadequate for his needs, see id.\n      (noting that the library and its resources w ere “inadequate” for the\n      plaintiff’s “legitimate queries”); and he did not explain that his legal\n      claim was nonfrivolous. See Penrod v. Zavaras, 94 F.3d 1399, 1403\n      (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that the “[p]laintiff failed to allege that the\n      library restrictions placed on unassigned prisoners hindered his effort\n      to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim”).\n\n                                         - 31 -\n\fId. at 1290. Unlike the plaintiff in M cBride, however, M r. Trujillo specifically\n\nalleged that he was seeking New M exico legal materials relevant to challenge his\n\nsentence collaterally and clarified that New M exico’s exact cite system left him\n\nwith inadequate materials to pursue such litigation.\n\n      Admittedly, he did not specifically explain that his legal claim was\n\nnonfrivolous— a factor that supported the court’s dismissal in M cBride, 240 F.3d\n\nat 1288, 1290 (failure to state a claim), and Penrod, 94 F.3d at 1402-03 (summary\n\njudgment). But a pro se plaintiff, like M r. Trujillo, “w hose factual allegations are\n\nclose to stating a claim but are missing some important element that may not have\n\noccurred to him, should be allowed to amend his complaint.” Hall, 935 F.2d at\n\n1110. W e therefore conclude that the district court improperly dismissed M r.\n\nTrujillo’s § 1983 denial of access to courts claim against the New M exico\n\ndefendants.\n\n              3.    Eighth A mendm ent claim for nutritionally inadequate diet\n\n      Prison officials must ensure “inmates receive the basic necessities of\n\n[nutritionally] adequate food . . . .” Barney, 143 F.3d at 1310 (citing Farmer v.\n\nBrennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832-33 (1994)); see also Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d\n\n1218, 1222 (10th Cir. 2002). “A substantial deprivation of food may be\n\nsufficiently serious to state a conditions of confinement claim under the Eighth\n\nAmendment,” Thompson, 289 F.3d at 1222, where the prison officials\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 32 -\n\fdemonstrated “deliberate indifference,” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 105\n\n(1976). See also Helling v. M cK inney, 509 U.S. 25, 35 (1993).\n\n      M r. Trujillo “may have a valid § 1983 claim; however, if he does it should\n\nbe pursued against the proper defendant in a court of proper [jurisdiction and]\n\nvenue.” Clayton, 26 F.3d at 982. In order for liability to arise under § 1983, a\n\ndefendant’s direct personal responsibility for the claimed deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right must be established. See Olson v. Stotts, 9 F.3d 1475, 1477\n\n(10th Cir. 1993) (affirming district court’s dismissal where “plaintiff failed to\n\nallege personal participation of the defendants”); Coleman v. Turpen, 697 F.2d\n\n1341, 1346 n. 7 (10th Cir. 1982) (noting defendants cannot be liable under § 1983\n\nunless personally involved in the deprivation). Nothing in M r. Trujillo’s\n\ncomplaint indicates any personal participation by the New M exico defendants in\n\ndetermining the amount of food M r. Trujillo received at the Virginia prison.\n\n      To the contrary, in his complaint, M r. Trujillo indicates that in response to\n\nhis request to review his classification, VDOC informed him that “New M exico\n\nhas authorized the adaptation of all policies and procedures adopted by the VDO C\n\nfor those inmates housed in Virginia,” except matters relating to classification.\n\nFurthermore, even if the Virginia defendants acted as agents for the NM DC, see\n\nN.M . Stat. § 31-5-17, art. 4(A) (“[T]he receiving state [is] to act . . . solely as\n\nagent for the sending state.”); Va. Code A nn. § 53.1-216, art. IV(a) (same),\n\nrecovery under § 1983 against the New M exico defendants cannot be imposed\n\n                                          - 33 -\n\fvicariously on a theory of respondeat superior. See M itchell v. M aynard, 80 F.3d\n\n1433, 1441 (10th Cir. 1996) (noting that there is no respondeat superior liability\n\nunder § 1983).\n\n       W e therefore affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim against the\n\nNew M exico defendants.\n\n             4.     Equal Protection claim\n\n       M r. Trujillo also alleges that he has been denied equal protection because\n\nhe has been treated differently than all other prisoners. Specifically, he claims\n\nthat NM CD informed W RSP not to allow M r. Trujillo to work because he was a\n\nNew M exico prisoner. 18 To the extent that M r. Trujillo is attempting to allege an\n\nequal protection violation against the New M exico defendants based on this\n\ninstruction from NM CD, we will allow him a chance on remand to amend his\n\nallegations, which are currently insufficient to state a cognizable equal protection\n\nclaim. 19\n\n       “Equal protection is essentially a direction that all persons sim ilarly\n\nsituated should be treated alike.” Grace United M ethodist Church v. City Of\n\n\n       18\n         To the extent that M r. Trujillo also alleges that the New M exico prison\nofficials violated the ICC by instructing W RSP not to employ him, that claim\ndoes not constitute a violation of federal law and therefore is not actionable under\n§ 1983.\n       19\n          To the extent that M r. Trujillo alleges the Virginia officials treated him\ndifferently than other out-of-state inmates transferred to Virginia or than other\nVirginia inmates generally by prohibiting him from working, we again note that\nthe district court lacked jurisdiction over the V irginia defendants.\n\n                                         - 34 -\n\fCheyenne, 451 F.3d 643, 659 (10th Cir. 2006) (emphasis added; quotation\n\nomitted). Thus, on remand, M r. Trujillo must state exactly to which group he\n\nbelieves he is similarly situated. For example, he must state whether the New\n\nM exico defendants, by instructing W RSP not to allow M r. Trujillo to work,\n\ntreated him differently than 1) other New M exico inmates transferred to out-of-\n\nstate prisons or 2) all New M exico inmates, such that it is the treatment of the\n\nclass of transferred inmates that cannot be justified.\n\n      Either way, because M r. Trujillo “does not claim that the defendants treated\n\nhim differently because of any suspect classification,” to prevail on his equal\n\nprotection claim he would have to prove that “the distinction between himself and\n\nother inmates was not reasonably related to some legitimate penological purpose.”\n\nTempleman v. Gunter, 16 F.3d 367, 371 (10th Cir. 1994). Although we note that\n\nthis is a heavy burden, we believe that M r.

Trujillo is a New M exico state prisoner who was transferred by the\n\nNew M exico Department of Corrections (NM DC) to W allens Ridge State Prison\n\n(W RSP) in Virginia on April 12, 2002. Immediately upon his arrival, WRSP held\n\na classification hearing at which M r. Trujillo was not permitted to present\n\nevidence, allegedly in violation of V irginia Departmental Operating Procedure\n\n821. 2 After the hearing, W RSP placed M r. Trujillo in segregation claiming that\n\nhe was a threat to the prison. M r. Trujillo’s initial appeal to the warden was\n\ndenied, but the regional director of the Virginia Department of Corrections\n\n(VDOC) determined M r. Trujillo’s subsequent grievance was founded and\n\ninformed M r. Trujillo that “appropriate administrative action ha[d] been taken.”\n\n\n\n\n      2\n         To the extent that M r. Trujillo “seeks relief for alleged violations of state\nstatutes and prison regulations . . . , he has stated no cognizable claim under\n§ 1983,” which establishes a cause of action only for deprivation of rights secured\nby the Constitution or federal law.

Trujillo’s classification, however, remained the same and no new hearing was\n\nconducted.\n\n      On July 9, 2002, at a second classification hearing during which M r.\n\nTrujillo was again not allowed to present witnesses or evidence, he was placed in\n\nsegregation under the explanation that he “need[ed] a longer period of\n\nadjustment;” “New M exico inmate.” M r. Trujillo appealed this decision on the\n\ngrounds that he had been in segregation for over 100 days when the average stay\n\nfor new arrivals in segregation was days or weeks; his appeal was denied by the\n\nwarden and the regional director. As a result, M r. Trujillo spent nearly a year in\n\nsegregation.\n\n      On M arch 9, 2003, M r. Trujillo wrote a letter to another regional director\n\nexplaining that he had been classified in a prejudicial and discriminatory manner\n\nbecause no Virginia or other out-of-state prisoner housed at W RSP w as classified\n\nin the same manner as he had been classified, nor housed in segregation for this\n\nlength of time, and requested that the director intervene. According to M r.\n\nTrujillo, the average stay in segregation for other prisoners at W RSP is less than a\n\nmonth, and prisoners rarely remain in segregation even for the most serious\n\noffenses for more than 180 days and usually only for sixty to ninety days. M r.\n\nTrujillo explained to the director that he had been in segregation for more than\n\n750 days. The letter was returned stating that his appeal to the director did not\n\nmeet the criteria for a Level III response.\n\n                                         -4-\n\f      On M arch 26, 2003, W RSP changed the rationale for M r. Trujillo’s\n\nsegregation to “inmate viewed as a threat to W RSP.” M r. Trujillo alleges that no\n\nfurther indication was given as to why he might now be viewed as a threat. And\n\nhe claims that there was no marked change in his behavior to warrant such an\n\nabrupt change in the rationale for keeping him in segregation. 3\n\n      In early M ay 2003, pursuant to Departmental Operating Procedure 821-\n\n7.1A , M r. Trujillo requested an annual review of his classification to assess\n\nwhether a change in his security level and treatment plan was warranted. That\n\nrequest w as denied. In late M ay 2003, M r. Trujillo filed another grievance with\n\nthe VDOC, claiming that he was entitled to a classification review and should not\n\nbe excluded because he was an out-of-state prisoner. In response, the W RSP\n\nwarden stated: “Your initial classification was completed by New M exico. The\n\nVDOC cannot reclassify you unless given permission by New M exico.” The\n\nregional director provided nearly the same response, stating: “Investigation\n\n\n\n\n      3\n         Liberally construed, these allegations may support a claim for retaliation\nagainst the Virginia defendants.

However,\n\nmatters relating to classification are still handled by New M exico.” Following the\n\nwarden’s instructions, M r. Trujillo then wrote to the secretary and the director of\n\nthe NM DC requesting reclassification of his status. He never received a response.\n\n      M r. Trujillo claims that the conditions of his confinement violated his\n\nFourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights, his constitutional\n\nright of access to the courts, and his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and\n\nunusual punishment. Based on these allegations, M r. Trujillo filed this § 1983\n\naction in federal district court for the District of New M exico against various\n\nVirginia and New M exico prison officials.\n\n                                   D ISC USSIO N\n\n      After granting M r.

As the\n\nSupreme Court has described:\n\n      Section 1915(d) [the precursor to § 1915(e)] is designed largely to\n      discourage the filing of, and waste of judicial and private resources\n      upon, baseless lawsuits that paying litigants generally do not initiate\n      because of the costs of bringing suit and because of the threat of\n      sanctions for bringing vexatious suits under Federal Rule of Civil\n      Procedure 11. To this end, the statute accords judges not only the\n      authority to dismiss a claim based on an indisputably meritless legal\n      theory, but also the unusual power to pierce the veil of the complaint’s\n      factual allegations and dismiss those claims whose factual contentions\n      are clearly baseless.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n         W e note that there is a split of authority as to whether a court can\nconsider such defenses in dismissing pursuant to § 1915.

The same caution applies to sua sponte dismissals for lack of personal\n\njurisdiction and improper venue.   Accordingly, under § 1915, the district court\n\nmay consider personal jurisdiction and venue sua sponte “only when the defense\n\nis obvious from the face of the complaint and no further factual record is required\n\nto be developed.” Fratus, 49 F.3d at 674-75 (quotations, alterations omitted).\n\nAnd the district court may dismiss under § 1915 only if “it is clear that [the\n\n\n\n\n      5\n         The Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) made three pertinent\nchanges to section 1915(d).

See Gaines, 292 F.3d at 1226 (directing the district court\n\non remand to determine whether the 75-day duration of plaintiff’s confinement in\n\nsegregation is itself atypical and significant); Perkins, 165 F.3d at 809 (requiring\n\nthe district court to have before it evidence that “fully address[es] both the\n\nduration and degree of plaintiff’s restrictions as compared w ith other inmates”\n\nbefore it may sua sponte dismiss a prisoner’s due process claim) (emphasis\n\nadded); see also Colon v.

Denial of constitutional right of access to the courts\n\n      M r. Trujillo’s “constitutional right of access to the courts is clearly\n\nestablished.” See Treff v. Galetka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711096\"><a href=\"/opinion/711096/robert-shawn-treff-v-kerry-galetka-individually-and-as-the-mailroom/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (10th Cir. 1996). To state a\n\nclaim for denial of such a right, M r. Trujillo “must show that any denial or delay\n\nof access to the court prejudiced him in pursuing litigation.” Id.; see also Lewis\n\nv. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (1996) (requiring that “the alleged shortcomings in\n\nthe library” actually hinder a prisoner’s “efforts to pursue a legal claim”).\n\n\n\n\n      17\n          To the extent that M r. Trujillo also raises an Eighth Amendment claim\nchallenging the conditions of his confinement in segregation, we conclude that “it\nis ‘patently obvious’ that [he] could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing\nhim an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.” Hall, 935 F.2d at\n1110 (quotations omitted). M r. Trujillo alleges that, as a result of his\nclassification, he has only limited access to education, employment, religious\nprogramming, housing assignment, recreation time and equipment, the telephone,\nand the commissary. In addition to the fact that M r. Trujillo has not alleged that\nthe responsible prison officials acted w ith “deliberate indifference,” these\nallegations do not demonstrate a deprivation “of the minimal measure of life’s\nnecessities,” as required to state a claim upon which relief may be granted\npursuant to the Eighth Amendment. Barney v. Pulsipher, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754311\"><a href=\"/opinion/754311/susan-barney-kathy-christensen-v-gerald-r-pulsipher-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1310\n(10th Cir. 1998).\n       To the extent that M r. Trujillo also alleges that the New M exico prison\nofficials violated the ICC, that claim does not constitute a violation of federal law\nand therefore is not actionable under § 1983. See Ghana v. Pearce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758860\"><a href=\"/opinion/758860/98-cal-daily-op-serv-8213-98-daily-journal-dar-11450-emory-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1208 (9th Cir. 1998); Stewart v.

Tansy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672127\"><a href=\"/opinion/672127/james-edward-clayton-v-robert-j-tansy-warden-his-agents-servants/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 982 (10th\n\nCir. 1993). Here, New M exico as the sending state bears the “burden of\n\nproviding the required state legal materials.” Id.\n\n      The district court construed M r. Trujillo’s complaint as alleging only\n\n“delays in obtaining certain New M exico legal materials from New M exico” and\n\ndismissed his denial of access to the courts claim because “the Constitution does\n\nnot ensure the access requested by Plaintiff” and because “Plaintiff does not\n\nallege any active interference with his preparation and filing of papers.” See\n\nLewis, 518 U.S. at 351 (describing that a prisoner does not have “an abstract,\n\nfreestanding right to a law library or legal assistance” and therefore “cannot\n\nestablish relevant actual injury simply by establishing that his prison’s law library\n\nor legal assistance program is subpar in some theoretical sense”). The district\n\ncourt misconstrued M r. Trujillo’s complaint and therefore erred in concluding that\n\nhe had not stated a cognizable § 1983 claim for denial of access to the courts\n\nagainst the N ew M exico defendants.\n\n      M r. Trujillo actually alleges that the New M exico defendants violated his\n\nright of access to the courts in two ways. First, as the district court noted, he\n\ncomplains that it takes an average of eighteen days for him to receive requested\n\n                                          - 30 -\n\fmaterial. He also alleges, however, that he is expected to know exactly what he\n\nneeds w ithout any knowledge of what materials might be available to him. This\n\nsecond allegation— an “exact cite” system— may state a viable claim of denial of\n\naccess to the courts. See Clayton, 26 F.3d at 982 (remanding to the trial court\n\nwith instruction to determine whether the exact cite paging system resulted in a\n\ndenial of the right of access to the courts).\n\n      Furthermore, M r. Trujillo alleged a “relevant actual injury.” See Lewis,\n\n518 U.S. at 351. Specifically, he claims that he suffered actual injury because the\n\ndefendants’ actions prevented him from filing a state habeas corpus petition and\n\nfrom challenging the N M CD’s ex post facto changing of his sentence. See id. at\n\n356 (“The tools [the guarantee of access to the courts] requires to be provided are\n\nthose that the inmates need in order to attack their sentences, directly or\n\ncollaterally, and in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement.”).\n\n      In M cBride v.

See Penrod v. Zavaras, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153855\"><a href=\"/opinion/153855/penrod-v-zavaras/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1403\n      (10th Cir. 1996) (holding that the “[p]laintiff failed to allege that the\n      library restrictions placed on unassigned prisoners hindered his effort\n      to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim”).\n\n                                         - 31 -\n\fId. at 1290. Unlike the plaintiff in M cBride, however, M r. Trujillo specifically\n\nalleged that he was seeking New M exico legal materials relevant to challenge his\n\nsentence collaterally and clarified that New M exico’s exact cite system left him\n\nwith inadequate materials to pursue such litigation.\n\n      Admittedly, he did not specifically explain that his legal claim was\n\nnonfrivolous— a factor that supported the court’s dismissal in M cBride, 240 F.3d\n\nat 1288, 1290 (failure to state a claim), and Penrod, 94 F.3d at 1402-03 (summary\n\njudgment). But a pro se plaintiff, like M r. Trujillo, “w hose factual allegations are\n\nclose to stating a claim but are missing some important element that may not have\n\noccurred to him, should be allowed to amend his complaint.” Hall, 935 F.2d at\n\n1110. W e therefore conclude that the district court improperly dismissed M r.\n\nTrujillo’s § 1983 denial of access to courts claim against the New M exico\n\ndefendants.\n\n              3.

In order for liability to arise under § 1983, a\n\ndefendant’s direct personal responsibility for the claimed deprivation of a\n\nconstitutional right must be established. See Olson v.

Equal Protection claim\n\n       M r. Trujillo also alleges that he has been denied equal protection because\n\nhe has been treated differently than all other prisoners. Specifically, he claims\n\nthat NM CD informed W RSP not to allow M r. Trujillo to work because he was a\n\nNew M exico prisoner. 18 To the extent that M r. Trujillo is attempting to allege an\n\nequal protection violation against the New M exico defendants based on this\n\ninstruction from NM CD, we will allow him a chance on remand to amend his\n\nallegations, which are currently insufficient to state a cognizable equal protection\n\nclaim. 19\n\n       “Equal protection is essentially a direction that all persons sim ilarly\n\nsituated should be treated alike.” Grace United M ethodist Church v. City Of\n\n\n       18\n         To the extent that M r. Trujillo also alleges that the New M exico prison\nofficials violated the ICC by instructing W RSP not to employ him, that claim\ndoes not constitute a violation of federal law and therefore is not actionable under\n§ 1983.\n       19\n          To the extent that M r. Trujillo alleges the Virginia officials treated him\ndifferently than other out-of-state inmates transferred to Virginia or than other\nVirginia inmates generally by prohibiting him from working, we again note that\nthe district court lacked jurisdiction over the V irginia defendants.\n\n                                         - 34 -\n\fCheyenne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794686\"><a href=\"/opinion/794686/grace-united-methodist-church-v-city-of-cheyenne-city-of-cheyenne-board-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">643</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659 (10th Cir. 2006) (emphasis added; quotation\n\nomitted). Thus, on remand, M r. Trujillo must state exactly to which group he\n\nbelieves he is similarly situated. For example, he must state whether the New\n\nM exico defendants, by instructing W RSP not to allow M r. Trujillo to work,\n\ntreated him differently than 1) other New M exico inmates transferred to out-of-\n\nstate prisons or 2) all New M exico inmates, such that it is the treatment of the\n\nclass of transferred inmates that cannot be justified.\n\n      Either way, because M r. Trujillo “does not claim that the defendants treated\n\nhim differently because of any suspect classification,” to prevail on his equal\n\nprotection claim he would have to prove that “the distinction between himself and\n\nother inmates was not reasonably related to some legitimate penological purpose.”\n\nTempleman v.
